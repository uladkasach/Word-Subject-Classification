Preface

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

The very fact that you are reading this preface indicates that you will be taking (or
are taking) a course in general chemistry. This guide is suitable for a college level
general chemistry course as well as a high school chemistry course, especially AP
Chemistry. It is also designed to assist someone in reviewing basic chemistry prin-
ciples in preparing for a professional exam, proﬁciency exam, or the like. 

Both  of  us  have  many  years  of  experience  in  teaching  introductory  general
chemistry at the university level, but each of us has certain skills and experi-
ences that will be of special help in the presentation of the chemistry material
in this book. Richard “Doc” Langley has taught high school chemistry and has
been a grader for the AP Exam chemistry free-response questions for years.
John Moore has years of experience teaching chemistry to both public school
teachers and students and is the author of Chemistry for Dummies. We are also
the coauthors of 5 Steps to a 5: AP Chemistry. We have tried to present the
material in such a way that it is understandable and to provide you with some
hints and tips to make your studying and learning the material more effective.

Use this book in addition to your regular chemistry text. In several places we will
refer you to your text for tables, and so on, that were too extensive to put in this
book. We have tried to concentrate on those topics that we ﬁnd most students have
trouble. Pay particular attention to the Utterly Confused About … section of each
chapter. These topics are the ones that we ﬁnd are the most difﬁcult for students
to  master.  The  Test  Yourself  section  will  give  you  an  opportunity  to  see  if  you
understand  the  concepts  and  should  point  out  your  weak  spots  for  additional
study. You will have to work and study hard to do well, but we are conﬁdent that
this book will help you master the material and lift that fog of confusion.

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

2

Get Started

Chemistry is full of calculations. Our basic goal is to help you develop the knowl-
edge and strategies you need to solve these problems. In this chapter, you will
review the Metric system and basic problem solving techniques, such as the Unit
Conversion Method. Your textbook or instructor may call this problem solving
method by a different name, such as the Factor-Label Method and Dimensional
Analysis. Check with your instructor or textbook as to for which SI (Metric) pre-
ﬁxes  and  SI-English  relationships  will  you  be  responsible.  Finally,  be  familiar
with the operation of your calculator. (A scientiﬁc calculator will be the best for
chemistry purposes.) Be sure that you can correctly enter a number in scientiﬁc
notation. It would also help if you set your calculator to display in scientiﬁc nota-
tion. Refer to your calculator’s manual for information about your speciﬁc brand
and  model.  Chemistry  is  not  a  spectator  sport,  so  you  will  need  to  Practice,
Practice, Practice.

1-1 Studying Chemistry 

The study of chemistry, like most sciences, involves active participation by the
student. We suggest brieﬂy reading in your textbook the lecture material for the
day,  taking  good  notes  in  class,  perhaps  copying  those  notes  as  quickly  after
class as possible, and then read the material in depth and work problems. This
book is designed to help you grasp the basic concepts and to help you learn how
to work the problems associated with the material. These speciﬁc tips will help
you in your study of chemistry.
• Take good, detailed notes in class.
• Strive for understanding, at least by the next class period, not just memorization.
• Study some chemistry every day—long study sessions right before an exam
are not nearly as effective as shorter, regular study sessions that usually take
less overall time.

• Work many, many problems, but again strive for understanding—it is a waste
of time to simply memorize how to do a particular problem; and it is also a
waste of time to simply look over the solution for a problem without striving
to understand why a certain procedure was followed.

• Nomenclature, the naming of chemical compounds, is extremely important.
When  the  time  comes,  learn  the  rules  and  apply  them.  Calling  a  chemical

Chemistry: First Steps

3

compound by the wrong name is certainly not the way to impress your chem-
istry teacher.

• Practice, Practice, and Practice some more.

You will be doing many problems in your study of chemistry. Here are some
speciﬁc suggestions to help you in your problem solving.
• Identify and write down what quantity you wish to ﬁnd.
• Extract  and  write  down  just  the  pertinent  information  from  the  problem,
especially the numbers and units—this is especially important for long word
problems.

• Identify and write down any equations or relationships that might be useful.
• Look for relationships among the information from the problem, the equa-

tions and the quantity you wish to ﬁnd.

• Use the Unit Conversion Method (explained in Section 1-4) in solving for the

desired quantity.

• Practice, Practice, Practice.

1-2 Properties of Matter 

You can view many things in chemistry on both the macroscopic level (the level
that we can directly observe) and the microscopic level (the level of atoms and
molecules. Many times, observations at the macroscopic level can inﬂuence the
theories and models at the microscopic level. Theories and models at the micro-
scopic  level  can  suggest  possible  experiments  at  the  macroscopic  level.  We
express the properties of matter in both of these ways.

Matter (anything that has mass and occupies space) can exist in one of three states:
solid, liquid, or gas. At the macroscopic level, a solid has both a deﬁnite shape and
a deﬁnite volume. At the microscopic level, the particles that make up a solid are
very  close  together  and  many  times  are  restricted  to  a  very  regular  framework
called a crystal lattice. Molecular motion (vibrations) exists, but it is slight.

Macroscopically, a liquid has a deﬁnite volume but no deﬁnite shape. It con-
forms  to  the  shape  of  its  container.  Microscopically,  the  particles  are  moving
much more than in the solid. There are usually clumps of particles moving rel-
atively freely among other clumps.

A gas,  at  the  macroscopic  level,  has  neither  a  deﬁnite  shape  nor  volume.  It
expands to ﬁll its container. The microscopic view is that the particles are far apart,
moving rapidly with respect to each other, and act independently of each other.

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

We indicate the state of matter that a particular substance is in by (s), (l), or (g).
Thus, H2O(g) would represent gaseous water (steam), H2O(l) would represent
liquid water, while H2O(s) would represent solid water (ice).

1-3 Units of Measurement (SI) 

The measurement system that you will most likely encounter is the SI (Metric)
system. Each quantity (such as mass and volume) has a base unit and a preﬁx
that modiﬁes the base unit. The preﬁxes are the same for all quantities and are
based on a decimal system. Below are some basic SI units; we will introduce
others in later chapters:

Length—meter (m)
Mass—kilogram (kg)
Volume—cubic meter (m3) or liter (L)
Temperature—Kelvin (K)

Some of the preﬁxes that we will be using in the SI system are in the following
table. Your instructor may want you to be familiar with others.

0.1 or 10⫺1
1,000 or 103
1,000,000 or 106

Sometimes it is necessary to convert from a measurement in the English system
to a measurement in the SI system. (The English system is sometimes referred
to as the U.S. Customary system of units.) There are numerous SI/English con-
versions. Consult your book and check with your instructor to see which they
recommend. We will be using the following in many of our examples:

Length:
Mass:
Volume:

1 inch (in) ⫽ 2.54 centimeters (cm)
1 pound (lb) ⫽ 453.59 grams (g)
1 L ⫽ 1.057 quart (qt)

We will be dealing with two types of numbers in chemistry—exact and meas-
ured  ones.  Exact  values  have  no  uncertainty  associated  with  them.  They  are

Chemistry: First Steps

5

exact normally by deﬁnition. There are exactly 12 items in a dozen, 36 inches in
a yard, and so forth. Measured values, like the ones you will be dealing with in
lab,  have  uncertainty  associated  with  them  because  of  the  limitations  of  our
measuring  instruments.  When  those  measured  values  appear  in  calculations,
the answer must reﬂect that combined uncertainty by the number of signiﬁcant
figures that you report in the ﬁnal answer. The more signiﬁcant numbers reported,
the greater the certainty in the answer. 

The measurements that you use in calculations may contain varying numbers of
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, so carry as many as possible until the end and then round off
the ﬁnal answer. The least precise measurement will determine the signiﬁcant
ﬁgures reported in the ﬁnal answer. Determine the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures
in each measured value (not the exact ones) and then, depending on the math-
ematical operations involved, round off the ﬁnal answer to the correct number
of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Here are the rules for determining the number of signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures in a measured value:

1. All nonzero digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.) are signiﬁcant.
2. Zeroes between nonzero digits are signiﬁcant.
3. Zeroes to the left of the ﬁrst nonzero digit are not signiﬁcant.
4. Zeroes to the right of the last nonzero digit are signiﬁcant if there is a dec-

imal point present, but not signiﬁcant if, there is no decimal point.

Rule 4 is a convention that we will be using, but some teachers or books may
use alternative methods, so check with your instructor for the convention she or
he would like you to use.

By these rules, 0.320400 would contain six signiﬁcant ﬁgures but 320,400 would
only contain four.

Another way to determine the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a number is to
express it in scientiﬁc (exponential) notation. The number of digits shown is the
number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For example, 2.305 ⫻ 10⫺5 would contain four sig-
niﬁcant ﬁgures. 

In  determining  the  number  of  signiﬁcant  ﬁgures  you  will  express  in  the  ﬁnal
answer, the following rules apply:

1. For  addition  and  subtraction  problems,  round  the  answer  off  to  the  same
number of decimal points as the measurement with the fewest decimal places.

18.256 cm ⫹ 7.25 cm ⫹ 2.7 cm ⫽ 28.206 cm ⫽ 28.2 cm (rounded to the

tenths place)

6

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

2. For multiplication and division problems, round off the answer to the same
number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the measurement with the fewest signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.

7.253 m ⫻ 3.52 m ⫽ 25.53056 m2 ⫽ 25.5 m2 (rounded to three

signiﬁcant  ﬁgures)

In this book, we will tend to be very strict in rounding off the ﬁnal answer to the
correct number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Your instructor will tell you just how strict
she or he wishes you to be. 

Don’t Forget!

Carry as many numbers as possible throughout the calculation and only round
off the ﬁnal answer.

1-4 Utterly Confused About

Problem Solving

In this section, we will introduce one of the two common methods for solving
problems.  (You  will  see  the  other  method  in  Chapter  5.)  This  is  the  Unit
Conversion Method. It will be very important for you to take time to make sure
you fully understand this method. You may need to review this section from
time to time. The Unit Conversion Method, sometimes called the Factor-Label
Method or Dimensional Analysis, is a method for simplifying chemistry prob-
lems. This method uses units to help you solve the problem. While slow initially,
with practice it will become much faster and second nature to you. If you use
this method correctly, it is nearly impossible to get the wrong answer. For prac-
tice, you should apply this method as often as possible, even though there may
be alternatives.

Let’s use the question of “How many feet are in 3.5 mi?” to illustrate how to apply
the Unit Conversion Method. First, we will organize the information by writing
the given value (3.5 mi) and the unit for the answer, separated by an equals sign.

3.5 mi ⫽ ? ft

Chemistry: First Steps

7

We now need a relationship involving miles. It does not matter what relation-
ship we use, any one will help you ﬁnd the answer. However, the ideal relation-
ship would involve the unit you now have and the unit you are seeking. In this
case, the relationship “5280 ft ⫽ 1 mi” is ideal. This relationship could appear
two different ways in a problem. These two ways are:

a5280 ft

1 mi

b    or    a 1 mi

5280 ft

b

In  this  situation,  we  will  want  to  use  the  ﬁrst  of  these  two  relationships.  We
know that we need this particular one in order to cancel the initial unit of
mile with the unit of mile in the denominator of this fraction. (If we were to use
the other term, we would get mile2/ft.) Now, we combine this relationship with
the initial value:

3.5 mi a5280 ft

1 mi

b ⫽ ? ft

This could also be written as:

a3.5 mi

1

b ⫻ a5280 ft

1 mi

b ⫽ ? ft

We can now cancel identical units:

3.5 mi 5280 ft
1 mi

⫽ ? ft

The only units remaining on the left are the ones we are seeking (feet). Now
that we have the proper units, we can enter the values into a calculator to ﬁn-
ish the problem.

3.5 mi 5280 ft
1 mi

⫽ ? ft

⫽ 18,480 ft ⫽ 18,000 ft

(proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures)

or

3.5 mi a5280 ft

1 mi

b ⫽ 18,000 ft (or 1.8 ⫻ 104 ft)

Unit Conversion problems can appear to be more complicated than this one.
However, they are not. They just involve more simple steps.

8

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Suppose the original question was “How many inches are in 3.5 mi?” We could
use our answer of the number of feet in 3.5 mi and apply the relationship “12 in ⫽
1 ft” to do one more conversion:

18,000 ft a12 in

1 ft

b ⫽ ? in

This step is just like the original conversion of miles to feet. We can now enter
these values into a calculator:

18,000 ft a12 in

b ⫽ 216,000 in ⫽ 220,000 in (or 2.2 ⫻ 105 in)

1 ft

In problems such as the mile to inch conversion, it is simpler to combine the two
calculations into one. In this case, we write the ﬁrst step:

3.5 mi a5280 ft

1 mi

b ⫽ ? in

Now, insert the second step and calculate the answer:

3.5 mi a5280 ft

1 mi

ba12 in

1 ft

b ⫽ 220,000 in (or 2.2 ⫻ 105 in)

This method allows us to get the answer without calculating an intermediate
value. It also avoids the possibility of too much rounding, which is always a con-
cern in multistep problems.

Don’t Forget!

Only round your ﬁnal answer to the proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

You can work all unit conversion problems by this procedure. In some cases,
such as the miles to feet problem, only one step is necessary. In other cases, such
as the miles to inches problem, more than one step is necessary. However, all
steps are of the same type. You will cancel one unit and get a new unit. This
process continues until the new unit matches the one that you are seeking.

One of the concepts students often see in the introductory material of chemistry
texts  is  density.  Density  is  deﬁned  as  the  mass  per  unit  volume  (density  ⫽
mass/volume). We treat this relationship as a simple deﬁnition and not just a

Chemistry: First Steps

9

mathematical equation for you to memorize. We will now explore how to use
this deﬁnition in the Unit Conversion Method. In this example, we wish to ﬁnd
the  density,  in  g/cm3,  of  a  sample  of  a  liquid,  given  that  2.00  ft3 of  the  liquid
weighs 97.5 lb.

Let’s begin by isolating the information from the problem:

Volume ⫽ 2.00 ft3 Mass ⫽ 97.5 lb Density = ? g/cm3

(You will notice that, in this problem, we do not concern ourselves with the dis-
tinction between weight and mass.) Once we have isolated the information, we
now write the deﬁnition of density:

Density ⫽

(Mass)

(Volume)

According to the Unit Conversion Method, we may begin with any mass unit
over any volume unit and have a density. Our isolated information supplies a
mass and a volume. We can now enter this information into the deﬁnition:

Density ⫽

(Mass)

(Volume)

⫽

(97.5 lb)
(2.00  ft3)

This gives us a density in terms of lb/ft3. While this is a density, it does not have
the desired units. To complete the problem, we need to make two conversions:
pounds to grams and cubic feet to cubic centimeters. We can do these conver-
sions separately, and in any order. There are several hundred ways to ﬁnish this
problem correctly. Each individual doing the problem will develop his or her
own “correct” method. The correct method for you will be the one that uses the
conversions you know. For example, here are some ways of changing 97.5 lb to
grams:

(97.5 lb)a453.59 g

1 lb

b ⫽ 4.42 ⫻ 104 g

(97.5 lb) a 1kg
(97.5 lb) a16 oz

2.205 lb

1 lb

b ⫽ 4.42 ⫻ 104 g
b ⫽ 4.42 ⫻ 104 g

ba103 g

1 kg

ba28.349 g

1 oz

10

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Clearly any of these procedures, and many more, will work. In this case, we will
use the ﬁrst:

Density ⫽

(Mass)

(Volume)

⫽

(97.5 lb)
(2.00  ft3)

a453.59 g

1 lb

b

We also need to perform a volume conversion. As with the mass conversion,
there are many different correct volume conversions. In this case, the conver-
sion will relate, in some way, to the length unit of feet. Thus, we might use 12 in ⫽
1 ft. If we incorporate this, we get:

(2.00 ft3)a12 in

1 ft

b

This will leave us with ft2 ⋅ in. This is not very useful. We need to remember that
ft3 means ft × ft × ft. We can use the following to cancel the ft3:

(2.00 ft3)a12 in

ba12 in

1 ft
An easier way of writing this would be:

1 ft

ba12 in

1 ft

b ⫽ . . . in3

(2.00 ft3)a12 in

1 ft

b3

⫽ 3456 in3 (unrounded)

Careful!

In this calculation you must remember that not only are the units cubed in the
in/ft conversion, but also the numbers.

We can then add our in/ft conversion to our density calculation:

Density ⫽

(Mass)

(Volume)

⫽

(97.5 lb)
(2.00 ft3)

a453.59 g

1 lb

ba 1 ft

12 in

b3

Now we have gotten to the units of g/in3. Since we do not have the units we are
seeking (g/cm3), we need at least one more step. We can ﬁnish the problem in
one more step if we know the relationship between inches and centimeters. If

Chemistry: First Steps

11

we do not know this conversion, we will need more than one additional step.
The inch/centimeter relationship is 1 in ⫽ 2.54 cm. Since the inches are cubed,
we will need to cube this relationship. Our density problem becomes:

Density ⫽

(Mass)

(Volume)

⫽

(97.5 lb)
(2.00  ft3)

a453.59 g

1 lb

ba 1 ft

12 in

b 3a

1 in

2.54  cm

b 3

This gives us the desired units of g/cm3. Since we now have the correct units, the
problem is now complete except for calculating the ﬁnal answer. (Notice, that
we did not concern ourselves with any calculations until now.)

We can enter the above values into a calculator and get:

Density ⫽ 0.780896 ⫽ 0.781 g/cm3

If you got 725 instead of 0.781, you forgot to cube both the 12 and 2.54 when
performing those steps. Other answers will result if you forget to cube one but
not the other.

Careful application of the Unit Conversion Method will make it much easier
and quicker to master your chemistry problems.

Studying chemistry requires the student to be an active participant. You must
take good notes, study, and, above all, work problems. Regular study every day
is far more effective than cramming right before an exam. 

The measurement system that is most widely used in chemistry is the SI system. It
incorporates a base unit for the various quantities and then uses preﬁxes to mod-
erate the value of the base unit. The Unit Conversion Method is a way to generate
easily the setup to a problem. Be sure to round off the ﬁnal answer to the correct
number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures and include the units with the ﬁnal answer.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you learn about the composition of the atom,
the periodic table, and the writing and naming of chemical formulas. Check with
your instructor to see how many element names and symbols you need to know,
although you will learn many of them through practice. We will only give you an
abbreviated list of ions and molecules, so consult your text for a more extensive
list.  Have  a  periodic  table  handy  for  the  discussion  throughout  the  chapter.
Practice, Practice, Practice.

2-1 Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons 

Our modern model describes the atom as an electrically neutral sphere with a
tiny  nucleus  in  the  center  containing  positively  charged  protons  and  neutral
neutrons. The negatively charged electrons are moving in complex paths out-
side the nucleus in energy levels at different distances from the nucleus. These
subatomic particles have very little mass expressed in grams; so we often use the
unit of an atomic mass unit (amu or simply u). An amu is 1/12 the mass of a car-
bon atom that contains six protons and six neutrons. Table 2.1 summarizes the
properties of the three subatomic particles.

Many books and teachers omit the charges on the particle symbols.

Since the atom is electrically neutral, but is composed of charged particles, the
number  of  positively  charged  protons  and  negatively  charged  electrons  are
equal. It is the number of protons in an atom that really deﬁnes the type of ele-
ment. For example, all sodium atoms (Na) contain 11 protons and 11 electrons
(to keep the atom neutral), but the number of neutrons may vary. Atoms of the

same element (same number of protons) but differing numbers of neutrons are
called isotopes.  The  following  symbolization  is  a  way  to  represent  a  speciﬁc
isotope:

ZX
A

X  represents  the  element  symbol  (from  the  periodic  table),  Z is  the  atomic
number, the number of protons, and A is the mass number, the sum of the pro-
tons plus neutrons. Subtracting the atomic number from the mass number (A⫺
Z) gives the number of neutrons present in this particular isotope. For example,
23
11Na

would contain 11 protons, 11 electrons, and 12 neutrons (23-11). 

Careful!

Both the atomic and mass numbers in this representation are counted values and
therefore integers.

2-2 The Periodic Table 

The periodic table, such as the one found at the back of this book, provides us
with a wealth of information. First, it shows the element symbol in the center of
the block. Above the element is the element’s atomic number, the number of
protons  in  the  element’s  nucleus.  Below  the  element  symbol  is  the  element’s
atomic mass. This mass is not a whole number because it is the average of the
masses of all the naturally occurring isotopes taking into account their abun-
dances (weighted average).

Quick Tip

The mass number can never be smaller than the atomic number.

There are a number of ways that we can use the periodic table to classify the
elements. One way is to divide all the elements into three groups: metals, met-
alloids,  and  nonmetals.  Look  at  the  periodic  table  in  this  book.  Notice  the

18

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

stair-stepped line starting at boron (B) and moving down and to the right. The
elements  bordering  this  line  (B,  Si,  Ge,  As,  Sb,  Te,  At)  are  the  metalloids.
These metalloids have properties of both of the other two groups (metals and
nonmetals). They have unusual electrical properties that make them valuable in
the computer and semiconductor industry. 

We classify the elements to the left of this line, excluding the metalloids and
hydrogen, as the metals. The metals have physical properties that we normally
associate with metals in the everyday world––they are solids (with the excep-
tion of mercury), they have a metallic luster, and are good conductors of both
electricity and heat. They are malleable (capable of being hammered into thin
sheets) and ductile (capable of being drawn into thin wires). And as we will see
later in this book, the metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions.

Careful!

Even though hydrogen is located on the left side of the periodic table, it is a
nonmetal.

The other elements, the ones to the right of the line and metalloids and also
including hydrogen are classiﬁed as the nonmetals. The nonmetals have prop-
erties that are opposite of the metals. Many are not solid, they have a dull lus-
ter, are nonconductors, and are neither malleable nor ductile. The nonmetals
tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions.

Quick Tip

You should highlight or color the metalloid elements on the periodic table for
practice  to  help  you  locate  the  metals  and  nonmetals.  Left  =  Metals;  Right  =
Nonmetals.

Another way of classifying the elements on the periodic table is by the period
and group to which they belong. Periods are the horizontal rows on the periodic

Atoms, Ions, and Molecules

19

table. They are numbered from 1 to 7. Elements in the same period have con-
secutive atomic numbers but differ predictably in their chemical properties.

Groups or families are  the  vertical  rows  on  the  periodic  table.  They  may  be
labeled  in  two  ways.  The  older  way  involves  a  Roman  numeral  and  a  letter,
either A or B. We call the groups labeled with an A the main-group elements,
while the B groups are the transition elements. Two horizontal groups, the inner
transition elements, belonging to periods 6 and 7 are normally pulled out of the
main body of the periodic table and are placed at the bottom of the table. 

A newer way of labeling the groups is by consecutive number from left to right,
1  to  18.  The  older  method  is  still  very  commonly  used  and  is  the  labeling
method we prefer and will use in this book.

Chemists give four main-group families special names:

IA (1) group
IIA (2) group
VIIA (17) group
VIIIA (18) group

alkali metals
alkaline earth metals
halogens
noble gases

2-3 Chemical Formulas: Ions and
Molecules 

Atoms may combine to form compounds. A compound is a combination of two
or more different elements in a speciﬁc ratio. We use a formula to represent this
compound. H2O is a formula representing water, a compound composed of two
atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. An empirical formula shows the
atoms  found  in  the  compound  and  the  lowest  whole  number  ratio  of  those
atoms.  The  empirical  formula  of  water  would  be  H2O.  However,  suppose
another compound of hydrogen and oxygen had an empirical formula of HO.
This empirical formula tells us that there is only hydrogen and oxygen in the
compound and the two atoms are in a 1:1 ratio. The molecular or true formula
shows  what  atoms  we  ﬁnd  in  the  compound  and  the  actual  number  of  each
atom. A molecular formula for the empirical formula HO might be H2O2, the
compound hydrogen peroxide. The structural formula shows both the kind and
actual number of atoms in the compound but also shows the bonding pattern.
We will show you more about structural formulas when you study molecular
geometry.

A compound may be formed in two major ways. If a metal is reacting with a non-
metal, then the metal loses one or more electrons while the nonmetal gains those

20

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

electrons. Ions are formed. An ion is an atom or group of atoms that has a charge
due to the loss or gain of electrons. If the atom loses electrons, it is left with a pos-
itive charge due to having more protons (positive charges) than electrons (nega-
tive charges). Ions with a positive charge are cations. If the atom gains electrons,
it now has more electrons (negative charges) than protons (positive charges) and
it is left with a negative charge. Ions with negative charges are anions.

Atoms  of  the  main  group  or  representative  elements  tend  to  lose  or  gain
enough electrons to achieve the same number of electrons as the noble gas clos-
est to the element’s atomic number. The alkali metals all tend to lose one elec-
tron. For example, sodium and potassium metals would lose a single electron
each  to  form  Na⫹ and  K⫹.  The  alkaline  earth  metals  lose  two  electrons.
Magnesium and calcium would each lose two electrons to form Mg2⫹ and Ca2⫹.
(Ca  and  Ca2⫹ are not the  same;  these  formulas  refer  to  the  element  and  ion
respectively.) The halogens all tend to gain one electron. Therefore ﬂuorine and
chlorine would form F⫺ and Cl⫺. Oxygen would form O2⫺.

Don’t Forget! 

Metals tend to lose electrons to form cations while nonmetals tend to gain elec-
trons to form anions.

Sometimes groups of atoms may possess a charge and behave as ions. We call
these chemical species polyatomic ions. Examples include the ammonium ion,
NH4

⫺, and the bicarbonate ion, HCO3
⫺.

⫹, the nitrate ion, NO3

Since opposite charges attract each other, the cations attract the anions, form-
ing an ionic compound. Ionic compounds are neutral so that the number of pos-
itive charges would equal the number of negative charges. The potassium cation
would attract the chloride anion to form the ionic compound potassium chlo-
ride, KCl. We call ionic compounds such as this salts. 

Don’t Forget! 

In an ionic compound there must be the same number of positive and negative
charges. All compounds are neutral.

If a nonmetal reacts with another nonmetal no electrons are lost or gained, but
are shared. We call such compounds covalent (molecular) compounds. These
compounds contain small units we call molecules. Ammonia, NH3, water, H2O,
and methane, CH4, are examples of covalent compounds.

In the next section, we will show you how to name both salts and molecules.

2-4 Utterly Confused About

Naming Compounds 

Nomenclature is the term referring to the naming of compounds. In this section,
we will investigate how to name inorganic compounds. We will see how to name
organic compounds in Chapter 21. In order to name compounds correctly, you
will need to memorize certain elements and ions, and you will need to apply a
few rules.

We will use a limited set of elements and ions in our examples. Your instructor,
no  doubt,  will  require  you  to  learn  additional  names.  Our  limited  set  begins
with the following elements:

Metals:

Nonmetals:

Sodium
Magnesium
Aluminum
Copper

Hydrogen
Nitrogen
Chlorine
Carbon

Na
Mg
Al
Cu

H
N
Cl
C

Potassium
Calcium
Iron

Oxygen
Fluorine
Sulfur

K
Ca
Fe

O
F
S

You will need to commit these names and symbols to memory before attempt-
ing to apply the rules of nomenclature. It will also help you to locate each of
these elements on the periodic table.

You will also need to learn the names, formulas, and charges of the following
polyatomic ions:

Nitrate ion
Phosphate ion
Carbonate ion
Bicarbonate ion

⫺

NO3
3⫺
PO4
2⫺
CO3
HCO3

Nitrite ion
Sulfate ion
Ammonium ion

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Finally, you will need to memorize the common names of the following molec-
ular compounds:

Water H2O Ammonia NH3 Methane CH4

Don’t Forget! 

Get a complete nomenclature list from your instructor.

When naming compounds containing species not on these lists, it may help to
ﬁnd a chemical species on the list from the same family or a polyatomic ion that
is similar. 

Some compounds are simple molecules with special names. The short list con-
taining water contains examples of this type of nomenclature. You must simply
learn these names; more rules do not alter the fact that H2O is water. 

Some  compounds,  namely  molecular  compounds,  contain  only  nonmetals.
Normally the compounds you need to name are binary compounds (containing
only  two  elements).  If  you  have  highlighted  the  metalloids  on  your  periodic
table,  everything  to  the  right  of  the  metalloids  is  a  nonmetal.  The  following
rules  apply  to  both  nonmetals  and  metalloids.  The  only  nonmetal  excluded
from these nomenclature rules is hydrogen.

Don’t Forget! 

Hydrogen is nearly always an exception to the rules.

When  naming  a  molecular  compound,  we  name  each  element.  The  names
appear in the same order as they do in the molecular formula. The chemical
symbols in the formula are in the order the elements appear on the periodic
table. Thus, the element towards the right of the periodic table (excluding the
noble gases) will appear towards the right of the formula. If the elements are in
the same column, the one nearer the top will be last in the formula.

Atoms, Ions, and Molecules

23

Once you have the symbols in the correct order, you simply write the name of
the ﬁrst element followed by the name of second element. However, you will
need to remember that the name of the second element will end with an “-ide”
sufﬁx. Thus:

Oxygen becomes oxide
Fluorine becomes ﬂuoride
Sulfur becomes sulﬁde

Nitrogen becomes nitride
Chlorine becomes chloride
Carbon becomes carbide

To complete the name, it is necessary to add preﬁxes to indicate the number of
atoms. We will use the following list (your instructor may add a few more).

1 ⫽ mono 2 ⫽ di

3 ⫽ tri

4 ⫽ tetra

5 ⫽ penta

The ﬁnal “o” or “a” may be dropped if the name of the element begins with a
vowel. The preﬁx “mono” is being used less often, so you may only see it in a
very small number of compounds such as carbon monoxide, CO.

Let’s  use  the  following  compounds  as  examples:  CS2,  ClF3,  and  N2O5.  You
should locate the elements in each compound on the periodic table to conﬁrm
the order they appear in the formula. The next step is to write the name of each
element in the same order that they appear in the formula:

CS2
carbon sulfur

ClF3
chlorine ﬂuorine

N2O5
nitrogen oxygen

In each case, we need to change the name of the second element to one with an
“-ide” sufﬁx:

CS2
carbon sulﬁde

ClF3
chlorine ﬂuoride

N2O5
nitrogen oxide

Next, we need to add a preﬁx in those cases in which there is more than one of
a particular atom:

CS2
carbon disulﬁde

ClF3
chlorine triﬂuoride

N2O5
dinitrogen pentoxide

Reversing this procedure will allow us to write a formula from a name. Let’s try
this  with  carbon  tetrachloride  and  oxygen  diﬂuoride.  The  formulas  for  these
two compounds are CCl4 and OF2, respectively.

The presence of a metal in a compound indicates that ions are probably pres-
ent. (Recall that, other than hydrogen, all elements to the left of the metalloids

24

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

on the periodic table are metals.) Metals may combine with nonmetals or with
polyatomic ions. We will begin with binary compounds containing metals. The
naming  of  a  metal/nonmetal  compound  is  similar  to  naming  molecular  com-
pounds except that you do not use preﬁxes. (There are a few archaic names,
which  do  include  preﬁxes  in  their  name.  Your  instructor  will  let  you  know
which, if any, of these you will need to learn.) In these compounds, the cation
will always appear ﬁrst in both the name and the formula.

Without using preﬁxes, we need another method of determining the number of
each type of atom present. This method depends on the charges of each ion. We
can predict the charge of the ion from the element’s position on the periodic
table. Unfortunately, this method does not work very well for the transition ele-
ments, so we will save a discussion of transition metal compounds until later.
For the main group or representative elements, we simply ﬁnd the charges of
the  cations  by  counting  from  left  to  right  on  the  periodic  table,  skipping  the
transition metals.

If we locate the metals from our list on the periodic table, we see:

Na
K

Mg
Ca

Al

Sodium and potassium are in the ﬁrst column, so they, and any other metal in
this column, should form a cation with a ⫹1 charge. Magnesium and calcium
are in the second column, thus they, and any other metal in the same column,
should form a cation with a ⫹2 charge. Aluminum is in the third column (skip-
ping the transition metals), so that aluminum, and any other metal in the same
column, should form a cation with a ⫹3 charge. Thus, the cations of these ﬁve
metals are: Na⫹, K⫹, Mg2⫹, Ca2⫹, and Al3⫹.

Nonmetals are the opposite of metals. Thus, while metals give cations (positive
ions);  nonmetals  will  yield  anions  (negative  ions),  which  are  the  opposite  of
cations. We can predict the charge on an anion from the position of the non-
metal on the periodic table. Since nonmetals are the opposite of metals, we will
need to count in the opposite direction. The noble gases are zero. The next col-
umn to the left will be ⫺1, then ⫺2, and then ⫺3. The nonmetals on our list
should form the following anions:

N3⫺

O2⫺
S2⫺

F⫺
Cl⫺

Ions always have charges; compounds never have charges. How can we com-
bine charged ions and end up with no charge? The answer: add equal numbers
of positive and negative charges. The sum of equal numbers of positive charges

Atoms, Ions, and Molecules

25

and negative charges is zero. If the total of the charges is not zero, you do not
have a compound. 

If the metal and the nonmetal have the same magnitude of charge, you only
need one of each to produce a compound. Examples are:

Na⫹ ⫹ F⫺ → NaF

Ca2⫹ ⫹ S2⫺ → CaS

Al3⫹ ⫹ N3⫺ → AlN

When the magnitudes of the charges differ, the numbers of atoms will no longer
be the same. For example, if we combine calcium and chlorine, calcium pro-
duces the Ca2⫹ cation and chlorine produces the Cl⫺ anion. To balance the ⫹2
charge of the calcium, we need a ⫺2 charge from the chloride. Since each chlo-
ride only supplies a ⫺1, we need two chloride ions to get the needed ⫺2 charge.
The  formula  needs  one  Ca2⫹ and  2  Cl⫺ giving  CaCl2.  Now  try  this  with  alu-
minum and oxygen, and see if you can get the correct formula (Al2O3).

The names of the metal/nonmetals in this section are:

NaF ⫽ sodium ﬂuoride
AlN ⫽ aluminum nitride
Al2O3 ⫽ aluminum oxide

CaS ⫽ calcium sulﬁde
CaCl2 ⫽ calcium chloride

The presence of a polyatomic ion in a compound requires substituting the name
of  the  polyatomic  ion  for  the  name  of  the  cation  or  anion  in  a  comparable
metal/nonmetal compound. We will use no preﬁxes.

Let’s try an example. What is the formula of potassium phosphate? We can use
our method for assigning the charge of cations to predict that potassium will be
3⫺.
present as a K⫹ ion. You should already know that the phosphate ion is PO4
The difference in charges shows us that it will take three potassium ions to bal-
ance  the  charge  on  the  phosphate  ion.  Therefore,  the  formula  of  potassium
phosphate is K3PO4.

The transition metals, such as iron and copper on our list, require additional
consideration.  Most  transition  metals,  and  the  elements  located  around  lead,
Pb, on the periodic table, can form cations of different charges. For this reason,
we  need  additional  information  from  the  name  of  the  compound  containing
these metals.

We will use the two transition metals from our list to illustrate how we need to
treat  these  metals  in  compounds.  Iron  commonly  forms  either  Fe2⫹ or  Fe3⫹
ions; and copper commonly forms Cu⫹ and Cu2⫹. (Later you will see how to
predict why these metals form these ions.) In older literature, it was necessary to
memorize a separate name for each ion. Using this method, Fe2⫹ is the ferrous

26

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

ion, Fe3⫹ is the ferric ion, Cu⫹ is the cuprous ion, and Cu2⫹ is the cupric ion. The
ion with the greater charge always has the “-ic” sufﬁx.

To avoid the necessity of memorizing a separate name for each ion, we can use
the  Stock  system.  In  the  Stock  system,  the  charge  of  the  cation  appears  as  a
Roman numeral immediately after the name of the element. Using the Stock
system, we write Fe2⫹ as the iron(II) ion, and Cu⫹ as the copper(I) ion. Other
than the necessity of indicating the charges, there are no differences between
the naming of transition metal compounds and other compounds of the metals.
So while KCl is potassium chloride, CuCl is copper(I) chloride.

Finally,  we  need  to  consider  compounds  containing  the  nonmetal  hydrogen.
Remember  that  hydrogen  is  an  exception.  In  simple  binary  compounds  with
nonmetals, we treat hydrogen as a metal. As a “metal” in the ﬁrst column, it
should have a ⫹1 charge. Thus, H2S is hydrogen sulﬁde.

Many  hydrogen  compounds  are  acids.  Acids  require  a  different  system  of
nomenclature than other compounds. There are two types of acids: binary acids
and ternary acids. All acids include the word acid in their name. Binary acids
contain only two elements: one of which is hydrogen and the other a nonmetal.
When naming binary acids, the preﬁx “hydro-” appears before the root name
of  the  nonmetal,  and  there  will  be  an  “-ic”  sufﬁx.  As  an  acid,  H2S  would  be
hydrosulfuric acid. We used H2S to illustrate the fact that there can be two pos-
sible names, hydrogen sulﬁde or hydrosulfuric acid. If your instructor does not
specify which name to use, either is correct. Technically, the name hydrosulfu-
ric acid only applies to aqueous solutions of H2S, H2S(aq).

The ternary acids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic ion. As with
binary  acids,  the  word  acid  must  appear  in  the  name.  The  remainder  of  the
name of the acid will come from the name of the polyatomic ion. Ions ending in
“-ite” have these three letters changed to “-ous”, and ions ending in “-ate” have
⫺, becomes nitrous
these three letters changed to “-ic”. Thus, the nitrite ion, NO2
⫺, becomes nitric acid, HNO3. Some ions
acid, HNO2, and the nitrate ion, NO3
2⫺, becomes sulfuric
require a little more work; for example, the sulfate ion, SO4
acid, H2SO4.

In this chapter, you learned about the atom and the three basic subatomic par-
ticles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. You also learned about the periodic
table  and  about  the  classiﬁcation  of  the  various  elements  on  the  periodic
table.  Classiﬁcations  include  metal,  metalloid,  nonmetal,  and  classiﬁcation
according to the family (group) and period. You also learned the difference
between  ions  and  molecules,  and  how  to  name  ionic  compounds  and  mole-
cules systematically.

Get Started

This is a critical chapter in your study of chemistry. Our goal is to help you mas-
ter  the  mole  concept.  You  will  learn  about  balancing  equations  and  the
mole/mass relationships (stoichiometry) inherent in these balanced equations.
You will learn, given amounts of reactants, how to determine which one limits
the amount of product formed. You will also learn how to determine the empiri-
cal and molecular formulas of compounds. All of these will depend on the mole
concept. Make sure that you can use your calculator correctly. If you are unsure
about setting up problems, refer back to Chapter 1 of this book and go through
Section 1-4, on using the Unit Conversion Method. Review how to ﬁnd atomic
masses on the periodic table. Practice, Practice, Practice.

3-1 Balancing Chemical Equations 

A chemical equation represents a chemical change that is taking place. On the
left side of the reaction arrow are the reactants, the chemical substances that
are changed. On the right of the reaction arrow are the reaction products, the
new  substances  formed.  Sometimes  additional  information  appears  above  or
below the reaction arrow.

The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total mass remains unchanged.
This means that the total mass of the atoms of each element represented in the
reactants must appear as products. In order to indicate this, we must balance
the reaction. When balancing chemical equations, it is important to realize that
you cannot change the formulas of the reactants and products; the only things
you may change are the coefﬁcients in front of the reactants and products. The
coefﬁcients indicate how many of each chemical species react or form. A bal-
anced equation has the same number of each type of atom present on both sides
of  the  equation  and  the  coefﬁcients  are  present  in  the  lowest  whole  number
ratio.  For  example,  iron  metal  reacts  with  oxygen  gas  to  form  rust,  iron(III)
oxide. We may represent this reaction by the following balanced equation:

4 Fe(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g) l 2 Fe2O3(s)

This equation tells us that 4 iron atoms react with 3 oxygen molecules to form
2 rust compounds. Note that the number of iron atoms and oxygen atoms are
the same on both sides of the equation (2 ⫻ Fe2O3 ⫽ 4 Fe and 6 O). Let’s see
how we went about arriving at the balanced equation for the rusting of iron.

Mass, Moles, and Equations

33

First, write an unbalanced equation, showing the reactants and products:

___Fe(s) ⫹ ___ O2(g) l ___ Fe2O3(s)

The blanks indicate where we will add coefﬁcients. When balancing, you can
make no changes other then placing numbers in these blanks. Note that there
is one iron on the reactant side and two on the product side. To balance the iron
we need a coefﬁcient of 2 in front of the Fe on the reactant (left) side:

2 Fe(s) ⫹ ___ O2(g) l ___ Fe2O3(s)

Careful!

You can’t change the formulas of the reactants or products, just the coefﬁcients.

The irons are balanced but there are 2 oxygens on the reactant side and 3 on
the product side. The oxygens enter the reaction in groups of two, O2. We will
balance the oxygen atoms by placing a coefﬁcient of 1.5 in front of the O2 on
the left:

2 Fe(s) ⫹ 1.5 O2(g) l ___ Fe2O3(s)

That will give us 3 oxygens on both sides (1.5 ⫻ 2 ⫽ 3), but we must have coef-
ﬁcients that are whole numbers. The easiest way to achieve this is to multiply
everything by 2:

2 ⫻ [2 Fe(s) ⫹ 1.5 O2(g) l 1 Fe2O3(s)] giving the balanced equation:

4 Fe(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g) l 2 Fe2O3(s)

If a particular coefﬁcient is 1, we commonly omit it.

Don’t Forget!

Make sure that all atoms balance and the coefﬁcients are in the lowest whole
number ratio.

34

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

We can balance most simple reactions by this trial and error method, by inspec-
tion,  but  some  reactions,  redox  reactions,  often  require  a  different  system  of
rules. We will show you how to balance these redox reactions in Chapter 18.

3-2 Avogadro’s Number and Molar Mass 

The mole (mol) is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of
particles  as  atoms  in  exactly  12  grams  of  carbon-12.  This  number  of  particles
(atoms, molecules, or ions) per mole is Avogadro’s number and is numerically
equal to 6.022 ⫻ 1023 particles. The mole is simply a term that represents a cer-
tain number of particles, like a dozen or a pair. The mole also represents a certain
mass of a chemical substance.

The substance’s molar mass is the mass in grams of the substance that contains
one mole of that substance. In the previous chapter, we described the atomic mass
of an element in terms of atomic mass units (amu). This was the mass associated
with an individual atom. At the microscopic level, we can calculate the mass of a
compound by simply adding together the masses in amu’s of the individual ele-
ments in the compound. However, at the macroscopic level, we use the unit of
grams to represent the quantity of a mole. 

Quick Tip

6.022 ⴛ 1023 particles ⴝ 1 mol ⴝ molar mass in grams

This relationship gives a way of converting from grams to moles to particles and
vice versa. If you have any one of the three quantities, you can calculate the
other  two.  For  example,  the  molar  mass  of  iron(III)  oxide,  Fe2O3 (rust),  is
159.689  g/mol  [(2  ⫻ 55.846  g/mol  for  Fe)  ⫹ (3 ⫻ 15.999  g/mol  for  O)].
Therefore,  if  we  had  50.00  g  of  iron(III)  oxide,  we  could  calculate  both  the
number of moles and the number of particles present.

(50.00 g Fe2O3)a1 mol Fe2O3

b ⫽ 0.313108605 mol ⫽  0.3131 mol Fe2O3

b

1 mol

⫽ 1.886 ⫻ 1023 Fe2O3 particles

Mass, Moles, and Equations

35

Notice that if we had grams and wanted just particles, we still would need to
incorporate the mole relationship.

Quick Tip

If you are starting with either grams or particles, you will need to calculate moles.

3-3 Moles and Stoichiometry 

As we mentioned previously, the balanced chemical equation not only indicates
what chemical species are the reactants and what the products are, but it also
indicates  the  relative  ratio  of  reactants  and  products.  Consider  the  balanced
equation for the rusting of iron:

4 Fe(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g) l 2 Fe2O3(s)

This balanced equation can be read as 4 iron atoms react with 3 oxygen mole-
cules to produce 2 iron(III) oxide units. However, the coefﬁcients can stand not
only for the number of atoms or molecules (microscopic level) but they can also
stand for the number of moles of reactants or products. So the equation can also
be read as: 4 mol of iron react with 3 mol of oxygen to produce 2 mol of iron(III)
oxide. In addition, if we know the number of moles, the number of grams or
molecules  may  be  calculated.  This  is  stoichiometry,  the  calculation  of  the
amount (mass, moles, particles) of one substance in the chemical equation from
another. The coefﬁcients in the balanced chemical equation deﬁne the mathe-
matical relationship between the reactants and products and allow the conver-
sion from moles of one chemical species in the reaction to another.

Consider  the  rusting  process  above.  How  many  grams  of  rust  (Fe2O3)  could
form in the reaction of 20.0 mol of iron with excess oxygen?

Careful!

Before any calculations can be done, you musthave a balanced chemical equation!!

36

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

You are starting with moles of iron and want grams of Fe2O3, so we’ll ﬁrst con-
vert from moles of iron to moles of Fe2O3 using the ratio of moles of Fe2O3 to
moles of iron as deﬁned by the balanced chemical equation:

(20.0 mol Fe)a2 mol Fe2O3

4  mol Fe

ba 159.689 g
1 mol Fe2O3

b

⫽  1.60 ⫻ 103 g  Fe2O3

The  ratio  of  2  mol  Fe2O3 to  4  mol  Fe  is  called  a  stoichiometric  ratio,  which
comes from the balanced chemical equation.

Suppose you also wanted to know how many grams of oxygen it would take to
react with the 19.9 mol of iron. All you would need to do would be to change the
stoichiometric ratio and the molar mass:

(19.9 mol Fe)a3 mol O2

4 mol Fe

ba 31.998 g
1 mol O2

b ⫽ 478 g O2

Notice  that  this  new  stoichiometric  ratio  came  from  the  balanced  chemical
equation.

Don’t Forget!

In working stoichiometry problems you will need the balanced chemical equa-
tion. In addition, if the problem involves a quantity other than moles, you will
need to convert to moles.

3-4 Limiting Reagent and Percent Yield 

In the examples above, we indicated that one reactant was present in excess.
The  other  reactant  is  consumed  and  there  would  be  some  of  the  reactant  in
excess left over. The ﬁrst reactant to react completely is the limiting reactant
(reagent). This reactant really determines the amount of product formed. There
are, in general, two ways to determine which reactant is the limiting reactant:

1. We assume each reactant, in turn, to be the limiting reactant and we calcu-
late the amount of product that forms. The reactant that yields the smallest
amount of product is the limiting reactant. 

Mass, Moles, and Equations

37

2. We calculate the mole-to-coefﬁcient ratio of each reactant by dividing the
moles of that reactant by its coefﬁcient in the balanced chemical equation.
The reactant that has the smallest mole-to-coefﬁcient ratio is the limiting
reactant. Many of us use this method.

Let us consider the rusting reaction once more. Suppose that 50.0 g of iron and
40.0 g of oxygen react. Calculate the number of grams iron(III) oxide that could
be formed.

First, write the balanced chemical equation:

4 Fe(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g) l 2 Fe2O3(s)

Next, convert the grams of each reactant to moles:

(50.0 g Fe)a1 mol Fe
(40.0 g O2)a1 mol O2

55.846 g

b ⫽ 0.89531927 mol Fe  (unrounded)
b ⫽ 1.250078 mol O2 (unrounded)

31.998 g

Divide each by the coefﬁcient in the balanced chemical equation. The smallest
result is the limiting reactant:

For Fe: 0.89531927 mol Fe/4 ⫽ 0.2238298 mol/coefﬁcient Limiting reactant

For O2: 1.250078 mol O2/3 ⫽ 0.4166927 mol/coefﬁcient

Finally, base the stoichiometry of the reaction on the limiting reactant:

(50.0 g Fe)a1 mol Fe

55.846 g

ba2 mol Fe2O3

4 mol Fe

ba 159.689 g
1 mol Fe2O3

b ⫽ 71.5 g Fe2O3

Quick Tip

Any time you are given the amounts (grams, moles, and so on) of more than one
reactant, you will need to calculate the limiting reactant.

38

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

In the problem above, the amount of product calculated based upon the limit-
ing reactant concept is the maximum amount of product that will form from the
speciﬁed amounts of reactants. This maximum amount of product is the theo-
retical yield. However, rarely is the amount that is actually formed (the actual
yield) the same as the theoretical yield. Normally it is less. There are many rea-
sons for this, but the principal one is that most reactions do not go to comple-
tion; they establish an equilibrium system (see Chapter 14 for a discussion on
chemical equilibrium). For whatever reason, not as much product as expected
is formed. We can judge the efﬁciency of the reaction by calculating the percent
yield. The percent yield (% yield) is the actual yield divided by the theoretical
yield and the resultant multiplied by 100 in order to generate a percentage:

%yield ⫽

⫻ 100 %

In  the  previous  problem,  we  calculated  that  71.5  g  Fe2O3 could  be  formed.
Suppose that after the reaction we found that only 62.3 g Fe2O3 formed. Calculate
the percent yield.

%yield ⫽

3-5 Percent Composition and

Empirical Formulas 

If we know the formula of a compound, it is a simple task to determine the per-
cent composition of each element present. For example, suppose you wanted
the  percentage  carbon  and  hydrogen  in  methane,  CH4.  First,  calculate  the
molecular mass of methane:

1 mol CH4 ⫽ 1 mol C ⫹ 4 mol H

Substituting the molar masses:

1 mol CH4 ⫽ 1(12.01 g/mol) ⫹ 4(1.008 g/mol) ⫽ 16.042 g/mol

(This is an intermediate calculation—don’t worry about signiﬁcant ﬁgures yet)

%carbon ⫽ [mass C/mass CH4] ⫻ 100%

⫽ [12.01 g/mol/16.042 g/mol] ⫻ 100% ⫽ 74.87 % C

%hydrogen ⫽ [mass H/mass CH4] ⫻ 100%

⫽ [4(1.008g/mol)/16.042 g/mol] ⫻ 100% ⫽ 25.13 % H

Mass, Moles, and Equations

Quick Tip

As a good check, add all the percentages together. They should equal to 100 %
or be very, very close.

In the problem above, we determined the percentage data from the chemical
formula. We can determine the empirical formula if we know the percent com-
positions of the various elements. The empirical formula tells us what elements
are present in the compound and the simplest whole-number ratio of elements.
The data may be in terms of percentage, or mass or even moles. However, the
procedure is still the same—convert each element to moles, divide each by the
smallest,  and  then  use  an  appropriate  multiplier  if  necessary.  We  can  then
determine the empirical formula mass. If we know the actual molecular mass,
dividing the molecular formula mass by the empirical formula mass, gives an
integer (rounded if needed) that we can multiply each of the subscripts in the
empirical formula. This gives the molecular (actual) formula, which tells what
elements are in the compound and the actual number of each.

An analysis of a gas sample found 2.34 g of nitrogen and 5.34 g of oxygen pres-
ent. What was the empirical formula of this gas?

(2.34 g N)a1 mol N
(5.34 g N)a1 mol O

14.0 1 g

16.00 g

b ⫽ 0.167 mol N        a0.167
b ⫽ 0.334 mol O    a0.334

0.167

b ⫽ 1.00
b ⫽ 2.00

0.167

The  data  indicates  that  the  nitrogen  and  oxygen  are  present  in  a  1:2  ratio.
Therefore, the empirical formula is NO2.

If we determined that the actual molecular mass of this gas was 92.00 g/mol, what
is the molecular formula?

The empirical formula mass is 46.00 g/mol. Dividing the actual molar mass by
the empirical molar mass gives:

92.00 g>mol
46.00 g>mol

⫽ 2

Therefore, the molecular formula is twice the empirical formula or N2O4.

3-6 Utterly Confused About

Mole Problems 

The mole is the most important concept in this chapter. Nearly every problem
associated  with  this  material  requires  moles  in  at  least  one  of  the  steps.  You
should get into the habit of automatically looking for moles. There are several
ways of ﬁnding the moles of a substance. You may determine the moles of a
substance from a balanced chemical equation. You may determine moles from
the mass and molecular weight of a substance. You may determine moles from
the number of particles and Avogadro’s number. You may ﬁnd moles from the
moles of another substance and a mole ratio. Later in this book, you will ﬁnd
even more ways to determine moles. In some cases, you will be ﬁnished when
you ﬁnd moles, in other cases, ﬁnding moles is only one of the steps in a longer
problem.

Let’s use the following chemical equation to examine the different ways of ﬁnd-
ing moles:

H2(g) ⫹ Cl2(g) l 2 HCl(g)

It  is  possible  to  consider  a  balanced  chemical  equation,  such  as  this  one,  on
many levels. One of these levels is the mole level. At this level, we can get the
moles just by reading the equation in terms of moles. 1 mol of H2 plus 1 mol of
Cl2 yields 2 mol of hydrogen chloride.

We  can  also  ﬁnd  the  moles  of,  for  example  chlorine,  from  the  mass  and  the
molecular weight. So, if we have 175 g of chlorine, how many moles of chlorine
do we have?

mol Cl2

⫽ (175 g Cl2)a 1 mol Cl2

70.9 g Cl2

b ⫽ 2.4683 ⫽ 2.47 mol Cl2

The value 70.9 is the molecular weight (mass) of the diatomic chlorine obtained
by multiplying the atomic weight of chlorine (from the periodic table) by two.

If we want to ﬁnd the moles of a substance from the number of particles, we
need to use Avogadro’s number. For example, let’s ﬁnd the moles of hydrogen
chloride in 2.62 ⫻ 1024 molecules of HCl.

mol HCl ⫽ (2.62 ⫻ 1024 molecules HCl)a

1 mol HCl

6.022 ⫻ 1023 molecules HCl

b

⫽ 4.3507 ⫽ 4.35 mol HCl

Mass, Moles, and Equations

41

Careful!

Many students use Avogadro’s number in inappropriate places. You should only
use Avogadro’s numberif you have or need the numberof particles.

Let’s examine the last of the common ways to ﬁnd moles. This method requires
that you have the moles of one substance in order to get the moles of another
substance.  The  moles  of  the  ﬁrst  substance  may  be  given  to  you  or  you  may
have  to  use  one  of  the  above  methods  to  determine  the  initial  mole  value.
Suppose we wished to know the number of moles of HCl that we might form
from 2.2 mol of H2.

mol HCl ⫽ (2.2 mol H2)a2 mol HCl

1 mol H2

b ⫽ 4.4 mol HCl

The term (2 mol HCl/1 mol H2) is a mole ratio. We got this mole ratio directly
from the balanced chemical equation. The balanced chemical equation has a 2
in front of the HCl, thus we have the same number in front of the “mol HCl.”
The balanced chemical equation has an understood 1 in front of the H2, for this
reason the same value belongs in front of the “mol H2.” The values in the mole
ratio are exact numbers, and, as such, do not affect the signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Let’s use the information from this chapter in one problem. This will be a long
problem that will probably have more facets to it than any other problem you
may see, but it will help you to see all sides of mole problems. We will begin by
stating the problem:

Solid iodine, I2, will react with ﬂuorine gas, F2 , to form gaseous iodine pentaﬂu-
oride, IF5. In one experiment, a scientist mixed 75.0 g of iodine with 4.00 ⫻ 10 23
molecules of ﬂuorine and allowed them to react. What is the percent yield if the
reaction produced 45.2 g of iodine pentaﬂuoride?

There are many important aspects of this problem. We must begin by extract-
ing the information. We have enough information to begin writing a reaction
and several quantities (with associated units).

l IF5(g) (unbalanced)

42

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Now that we pulled all the information from the problem, we no longer need
the original problem.

Having the pertinent information, we can go to the second step that involves
the equation. 

Don’t Forget!

In order to work any problem dealing with a chemical reaction, you musthave a
balanced chemical equation.

Since our initial equation is not balanced, we need to balance it.

I2(s) ⫹ F2(g)
75.0 g

4.00 ⫻ 1023 molecules

l 2 IF5(g)

45.2 g
? percent yield

The most important concept when working stoichiometry problems such as this
one  is  moles.  We  must  have  moles  to  proceed.  The  mole  determination  of
iodine will involve the molar mass of iodine (2 ⫻ 126.9 g/mol), while the mole
determination of ﬂuorine will involve Avogadro’s number (since we have num-
ber of ﬂuorine molecules). We can ﬁnd the moles of each as follows:

⫽ (75.0 g I2)a 1 mol I2
⫽ (4.00 ⫻ 1023 molecules F2)a

253.8 g I2

mol I2

b ⫽ 0.295508 mol I2

    (unrounded)
b

1 mol F2

6.022 ⫻ 1023 molecules F2

⫽ 0.66423 mol F2 (unrounded)

We could determine the moles of IF5 at this point; however, we will forego that
pleasure until we ﬁnish with the reactants.

We now have the moles of the two reactants. This should ring a bell–any time
you have the quantity of more than one reactant, you need to know which is the
limiting reagent. For this reason, our next step will be to determine which of our
reactants limits the reaction. We can determine which reactant is the limiting
reagent by dividing each of the moles by the coefﬁcient of each reactant from

the balanced chemical equation. (This is one place where, if we did not balance
the equation, we would be in trouble.)

The quantity (mole-to-coefﬁcient ratio) of F2 is smaller than that of I2; there-
fore, ﬂuorine  in  the  limiting  reactant  (reagent).  Once  we  know  the  limiting
reactant, all remaining calculations will depend on the limiting reactant.

Now we can ﬁnd the maximum number of moles of IF5 that can be produced
(theoretical yield). We will begin with our limiting reactant rather than using
the 45.2 g of IF5 given (actual yield). Remember, the limiting reagent is our key,
and we don’t want to lose our key once we have found it.

To ﬁnd the moles of IF5 from the limiting reagent, we need to use a mole ratio
derived from information in the balanced chemical equation. (This is another
place where, if we had not balanced the equation, we would be in trouble.)

mol IF5

⫽  (0.66423 mol F2)a2 mol IF5

We will not actually calculate the moles of IF5 yet; we will simply save this setup.

The problem asks for the percent yield. Recall the deﬁnition of percent yield:

%yield ⫽

actual yield

theoretical yield

⫻ 100 %

In this problem, the actual yield is the amount of product found by the scientist
(45.2  g  IF5);  therefore,  we  need  the  theoretical  yield  to  ﬁnish  the  problem.
Since  our  actual  yield  has  the  units  “g  IF5,”  our  theoretical  yield  must  have
identical units. To determine the grams of IF5 from the moles of limiting reac-
tant, we need the molar mass of IF5 [126.9 g I/mol I ⫹ 5 (19.00 g F/mol F) ⫽
221.9 g IF5/mol].

We can enter this theoretical yield (58.957 g IF5) , along with the actual yield
(45.2 g IF5), into the percent yield deﬁnition:

All the units in the percent yield calculation, except %, must cancel. This requires
that the yields in both the numerator and the denominator must have identical
units including the same chemical species.

Well, you made it through this difﬁcult problem. Pat yourself on the back and
forge ahead, but don’t hesitate to come back and review this problem as needed.

In  this  chapter,  you  learned  how  to  balance  simple  chemical  equations  by
inspection.  Then  you  examined  the  mass/mole/particle  relationships.  A  mole
has  6.022  ⫻ 1023 particles  (Avogadro’s  number)  and  the  mass  of  a  substance
expressed in grams. We can interpret the coefﬁcients in the balanced chemical
equation as a mole relationship as well as a particle one. Using these relation-
ships, we can determine how much reactant is needed and how much product
can be formed––the stoichiometry of the reaction. The limiting reactant is the
one that is consumed completely; it determines the amount of product formed.
The percent yield gives an indication of the efﬁciency of the reaction. Mass data
allows us to determine the percentage of each element in a compound and the
empirical and molecular formulas.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you learn about reactions in aqueous solu-
tions, including titrations. We will present a set of solubility rules you can use to
predict  whether  or  not  precipitation  will  take  place  when  two  solutions  are
mixed. You may want to talk to your instructor and/or check your text for other
solubility rules. These rules will be useful as you learn to write net ionic equa-
tions. If you are unsure about mass/mole relationships, you may want to review
Chapter 3. And remember—Practice, Practice, Practice.

4-1 Molarity (M)

A solution is a homogeneous (the same throughout) mixture composed of a
solvent, the part of the solution that is present in the greater amount, and one
or more solutes, the substance(s) present in the smaller amount. A solution in
which water is the solvent is an aqueous solution. Aqueous solutions are the pri-
mary focus of this chapter. We will investigate other solutions in Chapter 12.
One of the most important properties of a solution is its concentration—the rel-
ative  amount  of  solute  in  the  solution.  One  of  the  most  common  ways  of
expressing  concentration  is  molarity.  Molarity (M)  is  the  moles  of  solute  per
liter of solution. (We will see other ways of expressing the concentration of a
solution later.) For example, suppose you dissolved 0.500 mol of sucrose, cane
sugar, in enough water to make 1.00 L of solution. The molarity of that sucrose
solution would be:

0.500 mol sucrose/1.00 L solution ⫽ 0.500 mol/L ⫽ 0.500 M

Quick Tip

In preparing a speciﬁc molar solution, you should dissolve the required amount
of solute in a little solvent and then dilute to the required volume.

4-2 Solubility and Precipitation 

Many  of  the  reactions  that  you  will  study  occur  in  aqueous  solution.  Water
readily dissolves many ionic compounds as well as some covalent compounds.
Ionic compounds that dissolve in water (dissociate) form electrolyte solutions—
solutions that conduct electrical current due to the presence of ions. We may
classify  electrolytes  as  either  strong  or  weak.  Strong  electrolytes dissociate
(break apart or ionize) completely in solution, while weak electrolytes only par-
tially dissociate. Even though many ionic compounds dissolve in water, many
do not. If the attraction of the oppositely charged ions in the solid is greater
than the attraction of the water molecules to the ions, then the salt will not dis-
solve to an appreciable amount.

Compounds like alcohols are nonelectrolytes—substances than do not conduct
an electrical current when dissolved in water. However, certain covalent com-
pounds, like acids, will ionize in water, that is, form ions:

HCl(aq) l H⫹(aq) ⫹ Cl⫺(aq)

Don’t Forget!

Very  few  molecular  compounds,  other  than  acids,  are  electrolytes.  Molecular
compounds,  as  introduced  in  Chapter  2,  are  generally  compounds  composed
entirely of nonmetals.

Precipitation reactions involve the formation of an insoluble compound, a precip-
itate, from the mixing of two aqueous solutions containing soluble compounds. To
predict if precipitation will occur upon the mixing of two solutions, you must know
and be able to apply the following solubility rules. You should apply these rules to
all combination of cations with anions in each of the mixed solutions. 

Be Careful!

Be sure, however, that you do not try to break apart molecular species such as
organic compounds.

52

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

General solubility rules for the commonly encountered ions:
• All salts of Group IA (Na⫹, K⫹, and so on) and the ammonium ion (NH4
⫹)

are soluble.

• All  salts  containing  nitrate  (NO3

⫺),  acetate  (CH3COO⫺),  and  perchlorate

• All chlorides (Cl⫺), bromides (Br⫺), and iodides (I⫺) are soluble except those

(ClO4

⫺) are soluble.

of Cu⫹, Ag⫹, Pb2⫹, and Hg2

2⫹.

• All  salts  containing  sulfate  (SO4

Sr2⫹, and Ba2⫹.

2⫺)  are  soluble except  those  of  Pb2⫹,  Ca2⫹,

Salts containing the following ions are normally insoluble:
• Most carbonates (CO3

2⫺) and phosphates (PO4

of Group IA metals and the ammonium ion.

3⫺) are insoluble except those

• Most sulﬁdes (S2⫺) are insoluble except those sulﬁdes composed of Group IA

and IIA metals or the ammonium ion.

• Most hydroxides (OH⫺) are insoluble except those of Group IA metals, cal-
cium, strontium, and barium. (Later we will see that these are strong bases.)
• Most oxides (O2⫺) are insoluble except for those of Group IA and Group IIA

metals, which react with water. (These will produce strong bases.)

Don’t Forget!

You must know solubility rules in order to predict whether or not precipitation
will occur.

Don’t Forget!

You should only apply the solubility rules to combinations of ions.

Let’s  consider  the  following  problem  as  an  example  of  how  you  might  apply
these rules. Suppose a solution of lead(II) nitrate is mixed with a solution of
sodium iodide. Predict what will happen.

Aqueous Solutions

53

Write the formulas for the reactants:

Pb(NO3)2(aq) ⫹ KI(aq)

We need to know which ions are available. To do this, it will be helpful to break
apart any ionic reactants into their constituent ions:

Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 NO3

–(aq) ⫹ K⫹(aq) ⫹ I–(aq)

Next, in order to predict possible products we must consider all possible combina-
tions of cations with anions. Predict the possible products by combining the cation
of one reactant with the anion of the other and vice versa. In this case, we get:

PbI2 ⫹ KNO3

Don’t Forget!

You will never get a compound containing only cations or only anions.

Apply the solubility rules to the two possible products:

PbI2(s)
KNO3(aq)

Insoluble, therefore a precipitate will form
Soluble, no precipitate will form

Write the chemical equation by adding the predicted compounds to the product
side, and balance the resultant equation:

Pb(NO3)2(aq) ⫹ 2 KI(aq) l PbI2(s) ⫹ 2 KNO3(aq)

If  neither  possible  products  were  insoluble,  then  no  precipitation  reaction
would occur. The solution would be a mixture of all the ions. Situations where
“no reaction” occurs are often labeled NR.

4-3 Acids, Bases, and Neutralization 

Acids and bases are extremely common substances, as are their reactions with
each other. At the macroscopic level, acids taste sour (that is, lemon juice) and
react with bases to yield salts. Bases taste bitter (that is, tonic water) and react
with acids to form salts.

54

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

At  the  microscopic  level,  the  Arrhenius  theory  deﬁnes  acids as  substances
which,  when  dissolved  in  water,  yield  the  hydronium  ion  (H3O⫹)  or  H⫹(aq).
Bases are  deﬁned  as  substances  which,  when  dissolved  in  water,  yield  the
hydroxide ion (OH–). Acids and bases may be strong (as in strong electrolytes),
dissociating completely in water, or weak (as in weak electrolytes), partially dis-
sociating in water. (We will see the more useful Brønsted-Lowry deﬁnitions of
acids and bases in Chapter 15.) Strong acids include:

1. Hydrochloric acid, HCl
2. Hydrobromic acid, HBr
3. Hydroiodic acid, HI
4. Nitric acid, HNO3
5. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4
6. Chloric acid, HClO3
7. Perchloric acid, HClO4

Strong bases include:

1. Alkali metal (Group IA or Group 1) hydroxides (LiOH, NaOH, and so on)
2. Calcium, strontium, and barium hydroxides

Don’t Forget!

You must know the strong acids and bases.

Assume, unless told otherwise, that acids and bases not on the above lists are
weak.

Quick Tip

Hydroﬂuoric acid, HF, is not a strong acid.

Aqueous Solutions

55

Certain oxides can have acidic or basic properties. Many oxides of metals that
have a ⫹1 or ⫹2 charge are basic oxides because they will react with water to
form a basic solution:

Na2O(s) ⫹ H2O(l) l 2 NaOH(aq)

Many nonmetal oxides are acidic oxides because they react with water to form
an acidic solution:

CO2(g) ⫹ H2O(l) l H2CO3(aq)

H2CO3(aq) is named carbonic acid and is one of the reasons that most carbon-
ated beverages are slightly acidic. It is also the reason that soft drinks have ﬁzz,
because this carbonic acid can easily revert to carbon dioxide and water.

In general, acids react with bases to form water and a salt. The salt will depend
upon what acid and base are used:

HCl(aq) ⫹ NaOH(aq) l H2O(l) ⫹ NaCl(aq)
HNO3(aq) ⫹ KOH(aq) l H2O(l) ⫹ KNO3(aq)

Quick Tip

The salt will always contain a cation from the base and an anion from the acid.

Reactions of this type are neutralization reactions.

Acids  will  also  react  with  carbonates  and  acid  carbonates  (hydrogen  carbon-
–) to form carbonic acid, which then decomposes to carbon dioxide
ates, HCO3
and water:

2 HCl(aq) ⫹ Na2CO3(aq) l 2 NaCl(aq) ⫹ H2CO3(aq)

CO2(g) ⫹ H2O(l)

4-4 Oxidation-Reduction 

Oxidation-reduction  reactions,  commonly  called  redox reactions,  are  an
extremely important category of reaction. Redox reactions include combustion,
corrosion, respiration, photosynthesis, and the reactions occurring in batteries. 

Redox is a term that stands for reduction and oxidation. Reduction is the gain
of electrons and oxidation is the loss of electrons. In these reactions, the num-
ber of electrons gained must be identical to the number of electrons lost. For
example, suppose a piece of zinc metal is placed in a solution containing the
Cu2⫹ cation. Very quickly, a reddish solid forms on the surface of the zinc metal.
That substance is copper metal. At the molecular level, the zinc metal is losing
electrons to form the Zn2⫹ cation and the Cu2⫹ ion is gaining electrons to form
copper metal. We can represent these two processes as:

Zn(s) l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺
Cu2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺
l Cu(s)

(oxidation)
(reduction)

The electrons that are being lost by the zinc metal are the same electrons that
are being gained by the copper(II) ion. The zinc metal is being oxidized and the
copper(II) ion is being reduced.

Something  must  cause  the  oxidation  (taking  the  electrons)  and  that  sub-
stance  is  the  oxidizing  agent (the  reactant  undergoing  reduction).  In  the
example above, the oxidizing agent is the Cu2⫹ ion. The reactant undergoing
oxidation is the reducing agent because it is furnishing the electrons that are
being used in the reduction half-reaction. Zinc metal is the reducing agent
above. The two half reactions, oxidation and reduction, can be added together
to give you the overall redox reaction. When doing this, the electrons must
cancel—that is, there must be the same number of electrons lost as electrons
gained:

Zn(s) ⫹ Cu2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺

l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺ ⫹ Cu(s) or

Zn(s) ⫹ Cu2⫹(aq) l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ Cu(s)

In these redox reactions, there is a simultaneous loss and gain of electrons. In
the oxidation reaction part of the reaction (oxidation half-reaction), electrons
are being lost, but in the reduction half-reaction, those very same electrons are
being gained. Therefore, in redox reactions there is an exchange of electrons, as
reactants become products. This electron exchange may be direct, as when cop-
per metal plates out on a piece of zinc or it may be indirect, as in an electro-
chemical cell (battery).

Oxidizing and reducing agents are reactants, not products.

Another way to determine what is undergoing oxidation and what is undergo-
ing reduction is by looking at the change in oxidation numbers of the reactant
species. Oxidation occurs when there is an increase in oxidation number. In the
example  above,  the  Zn  metal  went  from  an  oxidation  state  of  0  to  ⫹2.
Reduction  occurs  when  there  is  a  decrease  in  oxidation  number.  Cu2⫹ went
from an oxidation state of ⫹2 to 0. In order to determine if a particular reaction
is a redox reaction, determine the oxidation numbers of each element in the
reaction. If at least one element changes oxidation number, it is a redox reac-
tion. Refer to your textbook for rules in assigning oxidation numbers.

We may predict many redox reactions of metals by using an activity series. An
activity series lists reactions showing how various metals and hydrogen oxidize
in aqueous solution. Elements at the top of the series are more reactive (active)
than elements below. A reaction occurs when an element interacts with a cation
of an element lower in the series. The more active elements have a stronger ten-
dency to oxidize than the less active elements. The less active elements tend to
reduce instead of oxidize. The reduction reactions are the reverse of the oxida-
tion reactions given in the activity series table, Table 4-1. This is an abbrevi-
ated table. Refer to your textbook for a more complete table.

Quick Tip

These types of reactions are sometimes called displacement reactions in which
one atom is displacing another atom from a compound.

We may use the activity series to predict certain types of redox reactions. For
example, suppose you wanted to write the equation between magnesium metal
and hydrochloric acid: 

Mg(s) ⫹ HCl(aq) l

Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (strong electrolyte). Therefore, the species
present would be Mg(s), H⫹(aq), and Cl⫺(aq). Locate the element (Mg) and the
cation (H⫹) in the activity series.

Mg(s) l Mg2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺
H2(g) l 2 H⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺

In order for there to be a reaction between the two, the element must be above
the cation in the activity series. Since Mg is higher on the table, it will oxidize
(react as shown in the table). (Note: only Mg, not Mg2⫹, undergoes oxidation.)
If a substance undergoes oxidation then something must also undergo reduc-
tion.  In  this  problem,  the  only  option  for  a  reduction  species  is  the  H⫹.  The
reduction is the reverse of the equation in the table.

Don’t Forget!

The element in the activity series neverhas a charge.

4-5 Utterly Confused About

Net Ionic Equations

There are several ways to represent reactions in water. Suppose, for example,
that we were writing an equation to describe the mixing of a lead(II) nitrate
solution with a sodium sulfate solution and showing the resulting formation of

Aqueous Solutions

59

lead(II) sulfate solid. One type of equation is the molecular equation in which
both the reactants and products are in the undissociated form:

Pb(NO3)2(aq) ⫹ Na2SO4(aq) l PbSO4(s) ⫹ 2 NaNO3(aq)

In a molecular equation, we pretend that everything is a molecule (a nonelec-
trolyte). Molecular equations are quite useful when doing reaction stoichiome-
try problems.

Showing  the  strong  electrolytes  in  the  form  of  ions  yields  the  ionic  equation
(sometimes called the total or overall ionic equation). The strong electrolytes
are any strong acid, strong base, or water soluble (according to the solubility
rules) ionic compound. In this example, the ionic equation is:

Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 NO3

⫺(aq) ⫹ 2 Na⫹(aq) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq)

l PbSO4(s) ⫹ 2 Na⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 NO3

⫺(aq)

Writing the equation in the ionic form shows clearly which species are really
⫺ appear on
reacting and which are not. In the example above, the Na⫹ and NO3
both sides of the equation. They do not react, but are simply there in order to
maintain electrical neutrality of the solution. Ions like this, which are not actu-
ally involved in the chemical reaction, are spectator ions.

Don’t Forget!

In writing ionic and net ionic equations, show the chemical species as they actu-
ally exist in solution.

We write the net ionic equation by dropping out the spectator ions and show-
ing  only  those  chemical  species  that  are  actually  involved  in  the  chemical
reaction:

Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 NO3

l PbSO4(s) ⫹ 2 Na ⫹(aq ) ⫹ 2 NO3

⫺(aq)

⫺ (aq ) ⫹ 2 Na ⫹(aq ) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq)

leaving

Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq) l PbSO4(s)

This net ionic equation focuses on the reactants only. It indicates that an aque-
ous  solution  containing  Pb2⫹ (any  solution,  not  just  Pb(NO3)2(aq))  will  react

60

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

with any solution containing the sulfate ion to form insoluble lead(II) sulfate. If
the net ionic equation form is used, we don’t need to know the spectator ions
involved. In most cases, this is not a problem.

Don’t Forget!

In  writing  ionic  and  net  ionic  equations,  don’t  break  apart  covalently  bonded
compounds unless they are strong acids that are ionizing.

Let’s  review  with  some  more  examples.  We  will  treat  these  together  to  give
additional practice on each step before moving on to the next step. These mul-
tiple  examples  allow  you  to  practice  each  step  before  moving  on  to  the  next
one. We will begin with reactants:

Cr(OH)3(s) ⫹ HClO4(aq) l
KCl(aq) ⫹ (NH4)3PO4(aq) l
Na2CO3(aq) ⫹ HCl(aq) l
Mg(NO3)2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l
HNO3(aq) ⫹ Ba(OH)2(aq) l
LiF(aq) ⫹ H2SO4(aq) l

Quick Tip

If the phases (s, l, g, aq) are not present, you may wish to add these terms, if pos-
sible, because they are useful reminders.

We will begin by predicting the products. To predict the products, we need to
know what ions are available. This will require an examination of each com-
pound to determine what ions are present. We will write this information below
each of the equations:

Cr(OH)3(s) ⫹ HClO4(aq) l

Each of these compounds is treated as a combination of cations (positive ions)
and anions (negative ions). You will neverhave a compound of only cations or
only anions.

The number of each type of ion is not important at this stage, and we do not
care, at this point, which are soluble, strong electrolytes, or weak electrolytes.

To predict the products, we combine each cation with the anion of the other
compound. We do this combination in a manner to give an overall charge of
zero.

There  is  one  complication  in  these  results.  The  compound  carbonic  acid,
H2CO3, is unstable in water. It will rapidly decompose to gaseous carbon diox-
ide and liquid water. Therefore, we should replace H2CO3 with CO2 ⫹ H2O.

Quick Tip

Some instructors will accept H2CO3 as the product. You should check with your
instructor to see how you should write the product of this reaction.

We can now balance each reaction by inspection:

Cr(OH)3(s) ⫹ 3 HClO4(aq) l Cr(ClO4)3 ⫹ 3 H2O

These are the balanced molecular equations. We have omitted the phase desig-
nations in order to enhance the readability in this book. In generally, you should
use them.

We now need to separate all the strong electrolytes into their component ions.
We may begin with any category of strong electrolyte. In these examples, we
will begin with the strong acids. Below each of the strong acids, we will write
the separated ions:

We can now write the complete or total ionic equation for each of the reactions.

All the separated ions should have “(aq)” after their formulas, as should the
hydroﬂuoric acid. Water is a liquid, and carbon dioxide is a gas. The insoluble
ionic materials, including those that are not strong bases, are solids. When we
add this information, we have the ionic equations:

You  can  go  back  and  add  these  phase  designations  to  the  original  balanced
molecular equations. The “(aq)” designation will go with each compound that
you separated into ions. The resultant molecular equations are:

Cr(OH)3(s) ⫹ 3 HClO4(aq) l Cr(ClO4)3(aq) ⫹ 3 H2O(l)
3 KCl(aq) ⫹ (NH4)3PO4(aq) l K3PO4(aq) ⫹ 3 NH4Cl(aq)

To get the net ionic equations, we must remove the spectator ions from the total
ionic equations. We eliminate anything that appears identical on both sides of
the reaction arrow. This cancellation gives:

Don’t Forget! 

When canceling, identical means identical. For example, Ca is not identical to Ca2⫹.

You will notice that in the second reaction, all species cancel. This will require
us to amend our molecular equation to:

KCl(aq) ⫹ (NH4)3PO4(aq) l No Reaction (NR is commonly used)

We can now rewrite the ionic equations without the cancelled species to have
the net ionic equations:

Cr(OH)3(s) ⫹ 3 H⫹(aq) l Cr3⫹(aq) ⫹ 3 H2O(l)

The last two equations need further simpliﬁcation by reducing the coefﬁcients
by the common factor of two. The ﬁnal net ionic equations are:

This method will work for most reactions. However, if a redox reaction is occur-
ring,  an  additional  consideration  is  necessary.  At  this  point,  the  presence  of

Aqueous Solutions

67

hydrogen, H2, or a metal indicates that redox is possible. We can determine if
there will be redox by using the activity series.

We will begin, as before, with a group of potential reactions:

HCl(aq) ⫹ Ni(s) l
CuBr2(aq) ⫹ Zn(s) l

Mg(s) ⫹ HC2H3O2(aq) l
Al2(SO4)3(aq) ⫹ Fe(s) l

We need to consider the constituent ions of the compounds.

As seen in the previous examples, we do not need to worry about the number of
each type of ion present, only their identity. There is a difference in these exam-
ples that we did not see before, and that we are treating water as H⫹ ⫹ OH⫺.

Don’t Forget! 

Elements, such as Ni(s), should not be changed to ions.

The anions, negative ions, are not of concern to us at this time. We only need
to  locate  the  elements  and  cations  on  the  activity  series  table.  Here  is  our
abbreviated activity series table with the substances from the ﬁrst reaction in
boldface:

The location of these species is very important. If there is to be a reaction, the
substance on the left must be above the substance on the right. If this is not true,
or if both substances are on the same side, there will be no reaction. If there is
a reaction, the substance higher on the table will react as shown in the table, and
the lower substance will react in the reverse direction. From the table, we need
to  copy  the  reactions  (remembering  to  reverse  the  lower  reaction).  We  only
need the two equations from the table, and to know there positions relative to
each other.

The other reactions give:

We need to adjust these equations so the number of electrons in each pair of
reactions matches. All the reactions, except the lithium equation, have two elec-
trons.  We  need  to  multiply  the  lithium  equation  by  two  so  its  electrons  will
match those in the hydrogen reaction. We then add each pair of reactions and
cancel the electrons:

Ni(s) ⫹ 2 H⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺

Mg(s) ⫹ 2 H⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺

l 2 Li⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e ⫺ ⫹ H2(g)

Later, we will see that the ﬁrst and second reactions are the net ionic equations
for these reactions.

To get to the molecular equation we must put the ions in the above reactions
into their original compounds.

Completing the reactants requires the addition of the following ions: reaction 1,
⫺; reaction 4, no ions; reaction 5, 2
2 Cl⫺; reaction 2, 2 Br⫺; reaction 3, 2 C2H3O2
OH⫺. To balance the reactions we add these ions to the other side of the reac-
tion arrow and combine with the cations present on the other side. This gives
the molecular equations.

4-6 Utterly Confused About Titrations

A common laboratory application of acid-base reactions is titration. A titration
is a laboratory procedure in which we use a solution of known concentration to
determine  some  information  (such  as  concentration  and  mass)  about  an
unknown substance. A titration may involve any type of reaction—acid-base,
redox, and so on. In this section, we will only consider acid-base titrations. The

Aqueous Solutions

71

calculations for acid-base titrations are identical to those for any type of titra-
tion reaction. The key to any titration calculation will be moles. 

In an acid-base titration you may either add acid to base or base to acid. This
addition continues until there is some indication that the reaction is complete.
Often a chemical known as an indicator will indicate the endpoint of a titration
reaction, the experimental end of the titration. If we perform the experiment
well, the endpoint should closely match the equivalence point of the titration,
the theoretical end of the reaction. All the calculations in this section assume
accurate experimental determination of the endpoint, and that this value is the
same as the equivalence point.

We will work with the following acid-base titration reaction for the remainder
of this section:

2 HC2H3O2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l Ca(C2H3O2)2(aq) ⫹ 2 H2O(l)

For  example,  we  could  use  this  reaction  for  determining  the  concentration  of
acetic acid, HC2H3O2, in vinegar. A titration problem will give you information
about one reactant, and ask you for information about the other reactant. In most
titration reactions, information about the products will not be necessary. You only
need to consider the products when we need to balance the chemical equation.

If we want to use the concentration of acetic acid to ﬁnd the concentration of
calcium hydroxide, we will need this step (the numbers are the coefﬁcients in
the balanced chemical equation):

a 1 mol Ca(OH)2
2 mol HC2H3O2

b

If we want to use the calcium hydroxide to ﬁnd out about the acetic acid, we will
need this step:

a2 mol HC2H3O2
1 mol Ca(OH)2

b

Don’t Forget! 

In titration calculations, you must consider the reaction stoichiometry.

72

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

All possible titration problems will simply be adding steps before and/or after
one of these two mole ratio terms. The problem will begin with the substance
with the most information, and proceed through one of these mole ratios to the
substance with less information given. 

Let’s begin with this titration question: How many moles of calcium hydroxide
are necessary to titrate 0.250 mol of acetic acid? We have information about the
acetic acid, and we are seeking information about the calcium hydroxide. We
will begin the problem with the acetic acid since we know more about it, and we
will end the problem with the calcium hydroxide since we do not know anything
about this compound. One way to remember what you need to do is to copy the
given  information  and  the  question  to  the  balanced  chemical  equation,  as
shown here:

2 HC2H3O2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l Ca(C2H3O2)2(aq) ⫹ 2 H2O(l)

0.250 mol

? mol

When written this way, you begin with the number and work towards the ques-
tion mark. We begin with the acetic acid and use the mole ratio with acetic acid
in the denominator:

(0.250 mol HC2H3O2) a 1 mol Ca(OH)2

2 mol HC2H3O2

b ⫽ 0.125 mol Ca(OH)2

This calculation leaves us with the appropriate number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Note that the units of HC2H3O2 have cancelled, leaving the desired units of
mol Ca(OH)2.

How  would  the  problem  be  different  if  the  titration  question  asked  is:  How
many moles of calcium hydroxide are necessary to titrate 0.0500 L of a 0.100 M
acetic acid solution? We can begin by adding our information to the balanced
chemical equation:

2 HC2H3O2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l Ca(C2H3O2)2(aq) ⫹ 2 H2O(l)

0.0500 L

0.100 M

? mol

As in the preceding example, we will begin with the acetic acid and go through
the same mole ratio to get to the calcium hydroxide. The difference in this prob-
lem is that we are beginning with liters and molarity instead of moles. We will
need to add a step to our calculation to change liters and molarity to moles. Part

Aqueous Solutions

73

of this step will use the deﬁnition of molarity, moles solute/ liters of solution.
For this problem, our setup will be:

(0.0500 L)a0.100 mol HC2H3O2

L

ba 1 mol Ca(OH)2
2 mol HC2H3O2

b

⫽ 2.50 ⫻ 10⫺3 mol Ca(OH)2

Don’t Forget! 

If the problem begins with milliliters instead of liters, you will need to convert
the milliliters to liters.

This calculation leaves us with the appropriate number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures and
the correct units.

Quick Tip

Molarity is a useful means of reporting concentrations. However, in most prob-
lems concerning molarity, you should use the deﬁnition (mol/L) instead of M.

The ﬁrst  part  of  this  problem  appears  in  numerous  problems  involving  solu-
tions. Moles are critical to all stoichiometry problems, so you will see this step
over and over again. This is so common, that anytime you see a volume and a
concentration of a solution, you should prepare to do this step.

Now let us try an example needing additional information after the mole ratio
step. How many grams of calcium hydroxide are necessary to titrate 0.200 mol of
acetic  acid? As  usual,  we  begin  by  adding  this  information  to  the  balanced
chemical equation:

2 HC2H3O2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l Ca(C2H3O2)2(aq) ⫹ 2 H2O(l)

0.200 mol

? g

74

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The calculation will begin as in the ﬁrst example in this section:

(0.200 mol HC2H3O2) a 1 mol Ca(OH)2

2 mol HC2H3O2

b

This will give us the moles of calcium hydroxide instead of the grams, thus we
need to add another step. We have moles and we need grams, the molar mass
relates these two quantities. We determine the molar mass by using the formu-
la and the atomic weights found in a table such as the periodic table.

Quick Tip

Anytime the problem deals with the moles and the mass of a substance, you will
very, very likely need to know the molar mass (molecular weight) of the sub-
stance to complete the problem.

The molar mass of calcium hydroxide is 74.10 g/mol. We can add the molar mass
to our calculation to convert our moles to grams:

(0.200 mol HC2H3O2) a 1 mol Ca(OH)2

2 mol HC2H3O2

ba74.10 g Ca(OH)2
1 mol Ca(OH)2

b

⫽ 7.41 g Ca(OH)2

This calculation leaves us with the appropriate number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures and
the correct units.

Now let’s work one of the more typical titration problems. What is the concen-
tration of a calcium hydroxide solution if 0.0250 L of a calcium hydroxide solu-
tion were necessary to titrate 0.0400 L of a 0.100 M acetic acid solution? We have
more  information,  but  this  does  not  change  our  ﬁrst  step  of  transferring  this
information to the balanced chemical equation. You should recognize that by
“concentration,” the problem means molarity.

2 HC2H3O2(aq) ⫹ Ca(OH)2(aq) l Ca(C2H3O2)2(aq) ⫹ 2 H2O(l)

0.0400 L

0.100 M

? M

0.0250 L

Aqueous Solutions

75

The calculation in this problem begins like the second example in this section:

(0.0400 L)a0.100 mol HC2H3O2

L

ba 1 mol Ca(OH)2
2 mol HC2H3O2

b

These steps give us the moles of calcium hydroxide. To get the molarity of cal-
cium  hydroxide,  we  use  the  deﬁnition  of  molarity,  which  tells  us  we  need  to
divide these moles by the volume, in liters, of the calcium hydroxide solution.
In order to ﬁnish the problem, we must add one more step:

(0.0400 L)a0.100 mol HC2H3O2

L

ba 1 mol Ca(OH)2
2 mol HC2H3O2

ba

b

1

0.0250 L

⫽ 0.0800 M Ca(OH)2

This calculation leaves us with the appropriate number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures and
the correct units.

It  is  possible  to  expand  these  examples  to  any  titration  problem,  acid-base,
redox, precipitation, and so on. Just remember that the key is the mole concept.

In this chapter, you learned about solutions and how to use molarity to express
the  concentration  of  solutions.  You  also  learned  about  electrolytes  and  non-
electrolytes. Using a set of solubility rules allows you to predict whether or not
precipitation will occur if two solutions are mixed. You examined the properties
of acids and bases and the neutralization reactions that occur between them.
You then learned about redox reactions and how to use an activity table to pre-
dict redox reactions. You learned about writing net ionic equations. Finally, you
learned how to use the technique of titrations to determine the concentration
of an acid or base solution.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to assist you in learning the concepts of gases and gas
laws. Be sure that you know how to properly use your calculator and, if you need
to, refer to Chapter 3 on the mole concept. It’s especially true with gas law prob-
lems that the only way to master them is to Practice, Practice, Practice.

5-1 Gas Laws (P, V, n, and T) 

Before we start describing the gas law relationships, we will need to describe
the concept of pressure. When we use the word pressure with respect to gases,
we may be referring to the pressure of a gas inside a container or we might be
referring to atmospheric pressure, the pressure due to the weight of the atmos-
phere above us. The pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere (atm). Commonly, the
unit torr is used for pressure, where 1 torr ⫽ 1 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury),
so that atmospheric pressure at sea level equals 760 torr. The SI unit of pressure
is the pascal (Pa), so that 1atm ⫽ 760 mm Hg ⫽ 760 torr ⫽ 1.01325 ⫻ 105 Pa (or
101.325 kPa). 

Dalton’s law says that, in a mixture of gases (A ⫹ B ⫹ C ⫹ . . . ), the total pres-
sure is simply the sum of the partial pressures (the pressures associated with
each individual gas). Mathematically, Dalton’s law looks like this:

PTotal ⫽ PA ⫹ PB ⫹ PC ⫹ . . .

If you know how many moles of each gas are in the mixture and the total pres-
sure, you can calculate the partial pressure of each gas by multiplying the total
pressure by the mole fraction of each gas:

PA ⫽ (PTotal) (XA)

The term XA refers to the mole fraction of gas A. The mole fraction of gas A is
equal to the moles gas A/total moles of gas in the mixture. The mole fraction is
a concentration unit that we will see again in Chapter 12.

The gas laws relate the physical properties of pressure (P), volume (V), tem-
perature (T), and amount (n) to each other. If we keep the amount (number of

Gases

81

moles of gas) constant, that is, no gas can get in or out; we can express the rela-
tionship between the other three by the combined gas equation:

P1 V1
T1

⫽

P2 V2
T2

1 and 2 refer to the initial and ﬁnal conditions of the gas, respectively.

Quick Tip

In any gas law calculation, you mustexpress the temperature in Kelvin.

For example, suppose you have a balloon occupying a volume of 10.0 L at an
internal pressure of 1.50 atm at 20.oC. It is heated to 70.oC and the pressure is
determined to be 2.00 atm. We can calculate the new volume using the com-
bined gas law. 

We will be solving the combined gas equation for V2, so we will take the com-
bined gas law and rearrange for V2:

⫽

V2

P1 V1 T2
T1P2

Don’t Forget!

The temperatures must be expressed in Kelvin. 20.⬚C ⫽ 293 K (K ⫽ ⬚C ⫹ 273)
and 70.⬚C ⫽ 343 K.

Substituting in the values:

⫽

V2

(1.50 atm) (10.0 L) (343 K)

(293 K) (2.00 atm)

⫽ 8.77986 ⫽ 8.78 L

In the combined gas equation, we held just the amount constant. If, however,
we hold two quantities constant and look at the relationship between the other
two we can derive the other common gas laws shown below in Table 5-1.

It is possible to combine Avogadro’s law and the combined gas law to produce
the ideal gas equation, which incorporates the pressure, volume, temperature,
and amount relationships of a gas. The ideal gas equation has the form of 

PV ⫽ nRT 

The terms in this equation are:

P ⫽ pressure of the gas in units such as atm, torr, mm Hg, Pa.
V ⫽ volume of the gas in units such as L, mL.
n ⫽ number of moles of gas
T ⫽ Kelvin temperature
R ⫽ ideal gas constant: 0.0821 L⭈atm/K⭈mol (for most problems)

The value for R is 0.0821 L⭈atm/K⭈mol if the volume is expressed in liters, the
pressure in atmospheres, and the temperature in Kelvin (naturally). You could
calculate another ideal gas constant based upon different units of pressure and
volume, but the simplest thing to do is to use the 0.0821 and convert the given
volume to liters and the pressure to atm. (The temperature must be in Kelvin
in any case.)

Don’t Forget!

The temperatures must be expressed in Kelvin.

Gases

83

Let’s see how we might use the ideal gas equation. Suppose you want to know
what volume 40.0 g of hydrogen gas would occupy at 37oC and 0.850 atm? You
have the pressure in atm, you can get the temperature in Kelvin (37oC ⫹ 273 ⫽
310. K), but you will need to convert the grams of hydrogen gas to moles of
hydrogen gas before you can use the ideal gas equation. 

Quick Tip

Be sure to use the correct molecular mass for those gases that exist as diatomic
molecules—H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2.

First, you’ll convert the 40.0 g to moles:

(40.0 g) ⫻ (1 mol H2/2.016 g) ⫽ 19.84 mol H2

(We’re not worried about signiﬁcant ﬁgures at this point since this is an inter-
mediate calculation.)

Now you can rearrange the ideal gas equation for the unknown quantity, the
volume.

PV ⫽ nRT

V ⫽ nRT/P

Finally, we enter in the numerical values for the different known quantities:

V ⫽ (19.84 mol) (0.0821 L⭈atm/K⭈mol) (310. K) / (0.850 atm)

V ⫽ 594 L (Rounded to correct signiﬁcant ﬁgures)

5-2 Gas Stoichiometry 

We can use the gas law relationships, especially the ideal gas law and the com-
bined gas law, in reaction stoichiometry problems. For example, suppose you
have  2.50  g  of  an  impure  sample  of  KClO3 and  you  want  to  determine  how
many grams of pure KClO3 are present. You heat the mixture and the KClO3
decomposes according to the equation:

2 KClO3(s) l 2 KCl(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g)

84

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The oxygen gas that forms occupies a volume of 550. mL at 27⬚C. The atmos-
pheric pressure is 731.3 torr.

Don’t Forget!

In using any of the gas laws, be sure to express the temperature in Kelvin.

At  this  point,  you  now  have  550.  mL  of  oxygen  gas  at  731.3  torr  and  300.  K
(27oC ⫹ 273). From this data, you can use the ideal gas equation to calculate the
number of moles of oxygen gas produced:

PV ⫽ nRT

n ⫽ PV/RT

You will need to convert the pressure from torr to atm: 

(731.3 torr) ⫻ (1 atm/760.0 torr) ⫽ 0.9622 atm

and express the volume in liters: 550. mL (1 L/1000 mL) ⫽ 0.550 L

Now you can substitute these quantities into the ideal gas equation:

n ⫽ (0.9622 atm) (0.550 L)/(0.0821 L⭈atm/K⭈mol) (300. K)

n ⫽ 0.021486 mol O2 (unrounded)

Quick Tip

Be sure, especially in stoichiometry problems involving gases, that you are cal-
culating  the  values  such  as  volume  and  pressure  of  the  correct  gas.  You  can
avoid  this  mistake  by  clearly  labeling  your  quantities  that  means,  mol of O2
instead of just mol.

Gases

85

Now you can use the reaction stoichiometry to convert from moles O2 to moles
KClO3 and then to grams KClO3:

(0.021486 mol O2)a2 mol KClO3

3 mol O2

ba122.55 g KClO3
1 mol KClO3

b ⫽ 1.7554 ⫽ 1.76g KClO3

Don’t Forget!

Check to make sure that your answer is reasonable. In this case, for example, the
mass of the KClO3 must be less than the mass of the impure mixture.

Another useful relationship is one derived from Avogadro’s law: 1 mol of any
gas occupies 22.4 L at STP (standard temperature and pressure of 0oC (273 K)
and 1 atm). If you can ﬁnd the volume at STP, you can then convert it to moles
using this relationship and then to grams, if needed.

Quick Tip

Be sure when using any of the gas laws that you are dealing with gases, not liq-
uids or solids. 

Don’t Forget!

If the value 22.4 L/mol is used, make sure that it is applied to a gasat STP.

5-3 The Kinetic-Molecular

Theory of Gases 

The kinetic-molecular  theory (KMT)  represents  the  properties  of  gases  by
modeling  the  gas  particles  themselves  at  the  microscopic  level.  The  KMT
assumes that:
• Gases are composed of very small particles, either small molecules or indi-

vidual atoms.

• The gas particles are so tiny in comparison to the distances between them, that

the KMT assumes the volume of the gas particles themselves is negligible. 

• The gas particles are in constant motion, moving in straight lines in a random
fashion and colliding with each other and the inside walls of the container.
These collisions with the inside container walls comprise the pressure of
the gas.

• KMT assumes that the gas particles neither attract nor repel each other. They
may  collide  with  each  other,  but  if  they  do,  it  assumes  the  collisions  are
elastic—no kinetic energy is lost, only transferred from one gas molecule to
another.

• Finally, the KMT assumes that the average kinetic energy of the gas is pro-

portional to the Kelvin temperature.

A gas that obeys all of these conditions is an ideal gas.

Using the KMT, we can derive several quantities related to the properties of
the gas particles. First, KMT qualitatively describes the motion of the gas par-
ticles. The average velocity of the gas particles is the root mean square veloc-
ity and has the symbol urms. This is a special type of average speed. It is the
average speed of a gas particle having the average kinetic energy. We can rep-
resent it as:

urms

⫽ 23RT/M

where

R is a molar (ideal) gas constant of 8.314 J/mol·K (8.314 kg·m2/s2·mol·K)
T is the Kelvin temperature
M is the molar mass of the gas. 

These root mean speeds are very high. Hydrogen gas, H2, at 20.oC has a value
of approximately 2000 m/s. 

Gases

87

Second, the KMT relates the average kinetic energy of the gas particles to
the Kelvin temperature.  We  can  represent  the  average  kinetic  energy  per
molecule as:

KE/molecule ⫽ 1/2 mv2

where

m is the mass of the molecule
v is its velocity. 

We can represent the average kinetic energy per mole of gas as:

KE/mol ⫽ 3/2 RT

where

R again is an ideal gas constant
T is the Kelvin temperature.

Graham’s law deﬁnes the relationship of the speed of gas diffusion (mixing of
gases due to their kinetic energy) or effusion (movement of a gas through a tiny
opening) and the molecular mass. In general, the lighter the gas, the faster is its
rate  of  effusion.  Normally  we  use  a  comparison  of  the  effusion  rates  of  two
gases with the speciﬁc relationship being:

r1/r2 ⫽

2M2/M1

where

r1 and r2 are the rates of effusion/diffusion of gases 1 and 2, respectively
M2 and M1 are the molecular (molar) masses of gases 2 and 1, respectively

We can use Graham’s law to determine the rate of effusion of an unknown gas
knowing the rate of a known one or we can use it to determine the molecular
mass of an unknown gas. For example, suppose you wanted to ﬁnd the molar
mass of an unknown gas. You measure its rate of effusion versus a known gas,
H2.  The  rate  of  hydrogen  effusion  was  3.728  mL/s,  while  the  rate  of  the
unknown gas was 1.000 mL/s. The molar mass of H2 is 2.016 g/mol. Substituting
into the Graham’s law equation gives:

rH2

/runk

⫽ 2Munk/MH2

(3.728 mL/s)/(1.000 mL/s) ⫽

2Munk/2.016 g/mol

Munk ⫽ 28.018336 ⫽ 28.02 g/mol

88

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Don’t Forget!

Your answer must be reasonable. Hydrogen is the lightest gas (2.018 g/mol) so
that any molar mass less than this value is not reasonable.

5-4 Nonideal Gases 

The KMT represents the properties of an ideal gas. However, there are no truly
ideal gases; there are only gases that approach ideal behavior. We know that
real gas particles do occupy a certain ﬁnite volume and we know that there are
interactions (attractions and repulsions) between real gas particles. These fac-
tors cause real gases to deviate a little from ideal behavior. However, a nonpo-
lar gas at a low pressure and high temperature would come pretty close to ideal
behavior. It would be nice, however, to have a more accurate model/equation
for those times when we are doing extremely precise work or we have a gas that
exhibits a relatively large attractive or repulsive force. Johannes van der Waals
introduced a modiﬁcation of the ideal gas equation that attempted to take into
account the volume and attractive forces of real gases by introducing two con-
stants a and b into the ideal gas equation. (Values for these two constants are
probably found in a table in your textbook.) The result is the van der Waals
equation:

(P ⫹ an2/V2)(V ⫺ nb) ⫽ nRT

The attraction of the gas particles for each other tends to lessen the pressure
of the gas since the attraction slightly reduces the force of the collisions of the
gas particles with the container walls. The amount of attraction depends on the
concentration of gas particles and the magnitude of the intermolecular force of
the particles. The greater the intermolecular forces of the gas, the higher the
attraction is, and the less the real pressure. Van der Waals compensated for the
attractive force by the term: P ⫹ an2/V2, where a is a constant for individual
gases. The greater the attractive force between the molecules, the larger the
value of a. 

The actual volume of the gas is less than the ideal gas. This is because gas
molecules  do  have  a  ﬁnite  volume  and  the  more  moles  of  gas  present,  the
smaller the real volume. The volume of the gas can be corrected by the V ⫺
nb term, where n is the number of moles of gas and b is a different constant
for each gas. The larger the gas particle, the more volume it takes up and the
larger the b value.

Gases

89

The larger the gas particle, the more concentrated, and the stronger the inter-
molecular forces of the gas, the more deviation from the ideal gas equation one
can expect and the more useful the van der Waals equation becomes.

5-5 Utterly Confused About Gas

Law Problems 

Gas law problems, like all problems, begin with isolating the variables and the
unknown from the question. The usual suspects in gas law problems are pres-
sure, volume, temperature, and moles. You will need to deal with at least two
of these properties in every problem.

Quick Tip

If you have a gas at a certain set of volume/temperature/pressure conditions and
at least some of the conditions change, then you will probably be using the com-
bined gas equation. If moles of gas are involved, the ideal gas equation will prob-
ably be necessary

We will begin with a two variable problem. A sample of a gas has a volume of
5.00 L at 25⬚C. What temperature, in ⬚C, is necessary to increase the volume of
the gas to 7.50 L? We start by separating the numbers (and associated units) and
the actual question from the remainder of the problem. Be very Careful! that
the variables starting together stay together. Each column in the following table
contains variables that began together.

V ⫽ 5.00 L

V ⫽ 7.50 L

T ⫽ 25⬚C ⫽ 298 K

T ⫽ ?⬚C

Quick Tip

When working gas law problems all temperatures used in the calculations must
be in Kelvin units. You should change any other temperature units to Kelvin as
soon as possible to minimize forgetting to do so later.

90

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The presence of two volumes (or two temperatures) is a very strong indication
that we will need to use the combined gas law. To use this gas law we need
subscripts to differentiate the different volumes and temperatures. Label one
volume V1 and the other V2. It does not matter which volume we label 1 or 2 as
long as we label all associated variables with the same subscript.

V1 ⫽ 5.00 L
T1 ⫽ 25⬚C ⫽ 298 K

V2 ⫽ 7.50 L
T2 ⫽ ?⬚C

The combined gas law is (P1V1/T1) ⫽ (P2V2/T2). It is possible to simplify this
equation in this problem by removing all variables not appearing in the table.
The  simpliﬁed  combined  gas  law  is  (V1/T1) ⫽ (V2/T2),  which  is  a  form  of
Charles’ law. After simpliﬁcation, we need to isolate the variable we are seek-
ing  (the  one  with  the  question  mark  in  the  table).  Isolation  of  T2 requires
manipulating the equation. There are various ways of doing this, all yielding the
equation T2 ⫽ (T1V2/V1). We now enter the appropriate values from our table
into this equation:

⫽

T2

(T1) (V2)

(V1)

⫽

(298 K) (7.50 L)

(5.00 L)

⫽ 447 K

To ﬁnish the problem we must convert this Kelvin temperature to the requested
Celsius temperature (T2 ⫽ (447 ⫺ 273)⬚C ⫽ 174⬚C.

Don’t Forget!

The answer must make sense. In this case, there was an increase in volume, and,
according to Charles’ law, the temperature must also increase.

Let’s try another example: A sample of gas has a volume of 2.50 L at 25⬚C and
745 torr. What will be the volume, in liters, of the sample if we increase the tem-
perature to 45⬚C and the pressure changes to 0.750 atm? As usual, we begin by
extracting the numbers (and associated units) along with the desired unknown
from the remainder of the problem.

P1 ⫽ 745 torr

V2 ⫽ ? L
T2 ⫽ 45⬚C ⫽ 318 K
P2 ⫽ 0.750 atm

Note that the mandatory conversion to Kelvin is present. We will need to do a
pressure conversion since P1 and P2 do not have the same units. We can do the
pressure  conversion  at  any  time;  however,  we  will  temporarily  postpone  this
step.  The  presence  of  two  values  for  any  variable  strongly  indicates  that  we
need to use the combined gas law [(P1V1/T1) ⫽ (P2V2/T2)]. In this case, we can-
not eliminate any of the variables. We will, therefore, go straight to the rear-
ranging step to isolate V2. This rearrangement gives V2 ⫽ (P1V1T2/T1P2). We
can now enter the values form the table into this equation. In addition, we will
add a step to cover the pressure conversion.

Quick Tip

Many students get into trouble because they place conversions randomly about
the page. If you do the conversion step as we did in this example, you will be
less likely to “lose” your conversion, and less likely to copy a value incorrectly.

Let’s try another problem: What volume does 2.05 mol of oxygen occupy at a
temperature of 25⬚C and a pressure of 0.950 atm? As usual, we begin by extract-
ing  the  numbers  (and  associated  units)  and  the  desired  unknown  from  the
remainder of the problem. 

P ⫽ 0.950 atm

T ⫽ 25⬚C ⫽ 298 K

V ⫽ ?

Since a second set of conditions is not present, we will most likely need to use
the ideal gas equation (PV ⫽ nRT). We need to rearrange this equation to iso-
late the unknown (V). Then we enter the appropriate values, including R, the
ideal gas constant:

Quick Tip

For some reason, many students rearrange the ideal gas equation incorrectly;
you should be very careful to check your rearrangement of this equation.

Another  type  of  gas  law  problem  involves  stoichiometry.  Gas  stoichiometry
problems are just like all other stoichiometry problems—you must use moles.
In addition, one or more gas laws are necessary. Let’s look at a gas stoichiome-
try problem. What volume, in liters of oxygen gas, collected over water, forms
when 12.2 g of KClO3 decompose according to the following equation:

2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) ⫹ 3 O2(g)

The temperature of the water (and the gas) is 20.⬚C, and the total pressure is 755
mmHg. (The vapor pressure of water at 20⬚C is given as 18 mmHg.) In this case,
we not only need to separate the numbers (and associated units) but also we
need the balanced chemical equation.

The presence of only one temperature, pressure, and volume indicates that we
need to use the ideal gas law. In order to ﬁnd the volume of oxygen we need the
pressure of oxygen, not the total pressure, nor the vapor pressure of water. To
ﬁnd the oxygen pressure we need a second gas law, Dalton’s law. In this case,
Dalton’s law has the form Ptotal ⫽ PO2

If it was not clear before, it should be clear now, that we still must ﬁnd moles.
We will ﬁnd moles from the mass of KClO3 and the balanced chemical equa-
tion. We need to determine the molar mass of KClO3 from the atomic weights
of the individual elements (122.55 g/mol). We now add our mole information to
the equation:

Quick Tip

You should be very careful! when working problems involving gases and one or
more other phases. The gas laws can only give direct information about gases.
This is why there is a mole ratio conversion (from the balanced chemical equa-
tion) in this example to convert from the solid (KClO3) to the gas (O2).

The  methods  shown  in  this  section  will  apply  equally  well  to  nonideal  (real)
gases,  with  van  der  Waals  equation  used  in  place  of  the  ideal  gas  equation.
However, real gases require the use of van der Waals constants from appropri-
ate tables.

Get Started

In this chapter, we will help you learn about the energy changes, especially heat,
which occurs during both physical and chemical changes. You might need to
review the Unit Conversion Method in Chapter 1 and the sections in Chapter 3
on balancing chemical reactions and the mole concept if you are not comfort-
able with them already. And remember to Practice, Practice, Practice.

6-1 Energy and Reactions 

Thermochemistry deals with changes in heat that take place during chemical
reactions. Heat is an extensive property, that is, it depends on the amount of
matter (or the amount of reactants that undergo change). Many times, we will
be  measuring  the  temperature  (average  kinetic  energy)  of  the  system.
Temperature is an intensive property, one that is independent of the amount of
matter present. We will be discussing the energy exchanges between the system
that we are studying and the surroundings. The system is that part of the uni-
verse that we are studying. It may be a beaker or it may be the solar system. The
surroundings are the rest of the universe that the change affects.

The most common units of energy that we use in the study of thermodynamics
are the joule and the calorie. The joule (J) is:

1 J ⫽ 1 kg⭈m2/s2

The calorie (cal) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of
1 g of water by 1⬚C and relates to the joule as:

1 cal ⫽ 4.184 J

Quick Tip

This is not the same calorie that is commonly associated with food and diets.
That is the nutritional Calorie, which is really a kilocalorie (1 C = 1000 cal).

Calorimetry is the laboratory technique used to measure the heat released or
absorbed during a chemical or physical change. The quantity of heat absorbed

Thermochemistry

99

or released during the chemical or physical change is q, and is proportional to
the change in temperature of the system. This system has a heat capacity, which
is the quantity of heat needed to change the temperature 1 K. It has the form:

Heat capacity ⫽ q/⌬T

The heat capacity most commonly has units of J/K. The speciﬁc heat capacity
(or speciﬁc heat) (c), is the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of
1 g of the substance 1 K: 

c ⫽ q/(mass)(⌬T) or q ⫽ (c)(mass)(⌬T)

The speciﬁc heat capacity commonly has units of J/g⭈K. The speciﬁc heat capac-
ity of water is 4.18 J/g⭈K. If we have the speciﬁc heat capacity, the mass, and the
change  of  temperature,  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  amount  of  energy
absorbed or released (q).

Quick Tip

The  speciﬁc  heat  capacity  of  water  is  necessary  to  solve  many  problems.
However, when reading the problem, it is often not apparent that you must use
this value. If the problem mentions water, its speciﬁc heat capacity will often be
part of the solution to the problem.

Don’t Forget! 

Don’t mix energy units, J and cal; always use appropriate conversions.

Another  related  quantity  is  the  molar  heat  capacity (C), the  amount  of  heat
needed to change the temperature of 1 mol of a substance 1 K.

Calorimetry involves the use of a laboratory instrument called a calorimeter.
Two types of calorimeters are commonly used, a simple coffee-cup calorimeter
and a more sophisticated bomb calorimeter. In both, we carry out a reaction
with known amounts of reactants and the change in temperature is measured.
Check your textbook for pictures of one or both of these.

100

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The coffee-cup calorimeter can be used to measure the heat changes in reac-
tions that are open to the atmosphere, qp, constant pressure reactions. We use
this type of calorimeter to measure the speciﬁc heats of solids. We heat a known
mass of a substance to a certain temperature and then add it to the calorimeter
containing a known mass of water at a known temperature. The ﬁnal tempera-
ture is then measured. We know that the heat lost by the added substance (the
system)  is  equal  to  the  heat  gained  by  the  surroundings  (the  water  and
calorimeter, although for simple coffee-cup calorimetry the heat gained by the
calorimeter is small and often ignored):

⫺qsolid ⫽ qwater

Substituting the relationships for q gives:

⫺(csolid ⫻ masssolid ⫻ ⌬Tsolid) ⫽ (cwater ⫻ masswater ⫻ ⌬Twater)

We can then solve this equation for the speciﬁc heat capacity of the solid.

We use the constant-volume bomb calorimeter to measure the energy changes
that occur during combustion reactions. We add a weighed sample of the sub-
stance under investigation to the calorimeter and then add excess compressed
oxygen  gas.  We  ignite  the  sample  electrically  and  measure  the  temperature
change of the calorimeter and the known mass of water. Generally, we know the
heat capacity of the calorimeter and can determine heat absorbed by the water.
Suppose we have a problem such as the one below:

We ignited a 1.5886 g sample of glucose (C6H12O6) in a bomb calorimeter. The
temperature  increased  by  3.682⬚C.  The  heat  capacity  of  the  calorimeter  was
3.562 kJ/ ⬚C, and the calorimeter contained 1.000 kg of water. Find the molar heat
of reaction (J/mol of glucose) for the reaction: 

C6H12O6(s) ⫹ 6 O2(g) l 6 CO2(g) ⫹ 6 H2O(l)

In solving problems of this type, you must realize that the oxidation of the glu-
cose released energy in the form of heat and that some of the heat was absorbed
by the water and the remainder by the calorimeter. You can use both the heat
capacity of the calorimeter and the mass and speciﬁc heat of the water with the
temperature  change  to  calculate  the  heat  absorbed  by  the  calorimeter  and
water:

(Heat capacity of the calorimeter) ⫻ (change in temperature)

⫽ Heat absorbed by the calorimeter

(Grams of water) ⫻ (speciﬁc heat of water) ⫻ (temperature change) 

⫽ Heat absorbed by the water

Thermochemistry

101

Total heat absorbed by the calorimeter and water

⫽ Total heat released by the glucose

Converting the grams of glucose to moles then allows us to calculate the molar
heat capacity: 

Heat released by the glucose/moles glucose ⫽ molar heat of reaction

You will need to change this value to a negative value because the reaction gave
off this quantity of heat.

Don’t Forget! 

Don’t confuse the heat capacity, speciﬁc heat, and the molar heat capacity.

6-2 Enthalpy (⌬H)

Many of the reactions which chemists study are reactions that occur at constant
pressure. Because this constant pressure situation is so common in chemistry,
scientists use a special thermodynamic term to describe this energy, enthalpy.
The enthalpy change, ⌬H, is equal to the heat gained or lost by the system dur-
ing constant pressure conditions.  The following sign conventions apply:

If ⌬H > 0 the reaction is endothermic

If ⌬H < 0 the reaction is exothermic

We sometimes call it the ⌬Hreaction (⌬Hrxn). The ⌬H is normally associated with
a speciﬁc reaction. For example, the enthalpy change associated with the for-
mation of hydrogen and oxygen gases from water is:

2 H2O(g) l 2 H2(g) ⫹O2(g)

⌬H ⫽ ⫹483.6 kJ

The positive sign indicates that this reaction is endothermic. This value of ⌬H
is for the decomposition of 2 mol of water. If 4 mol were decomposed, the ⌬H
would be 2 ⫻ 483.6 kJ.

If we reverse the reaction for the decomposition of water above, the sign of the ⌬H
reverses, ⫺483.6  kJ.  That  would  indicate  that  the  reaction  releases  483.6  kJ  of
energy in forming 2 mol of water. This would now become an exothermic process.

102

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Don’t Forget! 

Watch  your  signs  in  all  the  thermodynamic  calculations.  They  are  extremely
important.

Quick Tip

The ⌬H is dependent upon the state of matter. The enthalpy change would be
different for the formation of liquid water instead of gaseous water.

Don’t Forget! 

Pay close attention to the state of matter for your reactants and products and
choose the corresponding value in your tabulated enthalpies.

6-3 Hess’s Law

We can measure enthalpies of reaction using a calorimeter. However, we can
also  calculate  the  values.  Hess’s  law states  that  if  we  express  a  reaction  in  a
series of steps, then the enthalpy change for the overall reaction is simply the
sum of the enthalpy changes of the individual steps. If, in adding the equations
of the steps together, it is necessary to reverse one of the given reactions, then
we will need to reverse the sign of the ⌬H. In addition, we must pay particular
attention if we must adjust the reaction stoichiometry.  

It really doesn’t matter whether or not the steps which are used are the actual ones
in the mechanism (pathway) of the reaction because ⌬Hreaction is a state function, a
function that doesn’t depend on the pathway, only the initial and ﬁnal states.

6-4 Utterly Confused About Calorimetry

Quick Tip

Many people have trouble with the problems concerning this material. The major
cause is that many of the problems are too simple. You need to analyze carefully
what the questions are really asking. Unit conversions are exceedingly important
in working these problems.

Calorimetry  problems  appear  in  the  thermochemistry  chapter  of  many  texts.
These problems often appear intimidating, but this need not be the case. We
will begin with the following example: The burning of a 1.5886-g sample of glu-
cose  (C6H12O6)  in  a  bomb  calorimeter  resulted  in  a  temperature  increase  of
3.682⬚C. The heat capacity of the calorimeter was 3.562 kJ/ ⬚C, and the calorime-
ter contained 1000. g of water. Find the molar heat of reaction per mole of glu-
cose for the following reaction: 

C6H12O6(s) ⫹ 6 O2(g) l 6 CO2(g) ⫹ 6 H2O(l)

The  question  is  “Find  the  molar  heat  of  reaction.”  This  means  we  need  the
enthalpy change (⌬H) in kJ/mol (or J/mol) of glucose. The increase in temper-
ature means that this is an exothermic process (negative enthalpy change).

104

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The presence of water implies that we may need some properties of water. In
this case, we will need the speciﬁc heat of water (4.18 J/g⬚C).

Don’t Forget!

The presence of water in any problem may require various unspeciﬁed properties
of water. The most common unspeciﬁed values are the speciﬁc heat of water, as
in this problem, and the density of water.

Extracting the information from the problem gives:

C6H12O6(s) ⫹ 6 O2(g) l 6 CO2(g) ⫹6 H2O(l)
1.5886 g                          3.682⬚C

3.562 kJ/⬚C
1000. g H2O
4.18 J/g⬚C

We will begin by ﬁnding the quantity of energy involved in the reaction. The
energy produced did two things: part of the energy warmed the calorimeter and
the remainder of the energy warmed the water. We need to determine these two
values separately and then combine them to determine the total energy change.
The amount of energy absorbed by the calorimeter is:

b (1000. g) (3.682⬚C) ⫽ 15390.76 J (unrounded)

The total amount of heat energy will be the sum of these values (⌬Hcalorimeter ⫹
⌬Hwater). However, before we can sum these values, we must make sure the units
match. We can either convert the kilojoules to joules or the joules to kilojoules.
In this case we will convert the joules to kilojoules and then add the values.

Some  problems  use  the  total  heat  capacity  of  the  calorimeter  (calorimeter  +
water). This means that the summation has already been done for you, so that
you do not need to do the summation a second time.

We have already noted that the process was exothermic (the value is negative)
and  should  be  reported  as  ⫺28.50606  kJ  (unrounded).  The  sign  comes  from
convention (the deﬁnition of exothermic) and not from the calculation.

To get the ﬁnal answer, we must divide the energy released by the moles of glu-
cose. We ﬁnd the moles of glucose from the mass given in the problem and the
molar mass determined from the atomic weights of the elements.

Get Started

Our goal for this chapter is to help you to learn about electrons and the current
models for where those electrons are located within the atom. You may want to
brieﬂy review Chapter 2 concerning electrons, proton, and neutrons. Your text
will probably have some nice pictures of orbitals, so when you get to the section
on quantum numbers and orbitals, you might want to have your text handy. And
don’t forget to Practice, Practice, Practice.

7-1 Light and Matter 

In the early development of the atomic model scientists initially thought that,
they could deﬁne the sub-atomic particles by the laws of classical physics—that
is, they were tiny bits of matter. However, they later discovered that this parti-
cle view of the atom could not explain many of the observations that scientists
were making. About this time, a model (the quantum mechanical model) that
attributed the properties of both matter and waves to particles began to gain
favor. This model described the behavior of electrons in terms of waves (elec-
tromagnetic radiation).

Light, radiant energy, makes up the electromagnetic spectrum. Light includes
gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible, and so on. The energy of the electro-
magnetic spectrum moves through space as waves that have three associated
properties: frequency, wavelength, and amplitude. The frequency, ␯, is the num-
ber  of  waves  that  pass  a  point  per  second.  Wavelength,  ␭, is  the  distance
between two identical points on a wave, while amplitude is the height of the
wave. (See your textbook for a wave diagram.)

We deﬁne the energy associated with a certain frequency of light by the equation:

E ⫽ h␯ where h is Planck’s constant ⫽ 6.63 ⫻ 10⫺34J⭈s

In the development of the quantum mechanical model of the atom, scientists
found that an electron in an atom could have only certain distinct quantities of
energy associated with it and that in order to change its energy it had to absorb
or emit a certain distinct amount of energy. The energy that the atom emits or
absorbs is really the difference in the two energy states and we can calculate it
by the equation:

⌬E ⫽ h␯

Quantum Theory and Electrons

109

All  electromagnetic  radiation  travels  at  about  the  same  speed  in  a  vacuum,
3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s. This constant, c, is the speed of light and is the product of the
frequency and the wavelength:

c ⫽ ␯␭

Therefore, we can represent the energy change in terms of the wavelength and
speed of light:

7-2 Bohr’s Model

⌬E ⫽ hc/␭

Niels  Bohr  developed  the  ﬁrst  modern  atomic  model  for  hydrogen  using  the
concepts  of  quantized  energies—the  energies  associated  with  the  atom  could
only be of certain discrete values. The Bohr model postulated a ground state for
the  atom,  an  energy  state  of  lowest  energy,  and  one  or  more  excited  states,
energy states of higher energy. In order for an electron in an atom to go from
its ground state to an excited state, it must absorb a certain amount of energy
and if the electron dropped back from that excited state to its ground state, it
must emit that same amount of energy. Bohr’s model also allowed the develop-
ment of a method of calculating the energy difference between any two energy
levels:

The constant 2.18 ⫻ 10⫺18 J is the Rydberg constant, RH. The n’s are integers
associated with the initial and ﬁnal energy levels.

7-3 Quantum Mechanics

Bohr’s model worked relatively well for hydrogen, but not very well at all for
any other atom. Early in the 1900s, Schrödinger created a more detailed model
and set of equations that better described atoms by using quantum mechanical
concepts.  His  model  introduced  a  mathematical  description  of  the  electron’s
motion  called  a  wavefunction or atomic  orbital.  Squaring  the  wave  function
(orbital) gives the volume of space in which the probability of ﬁnding the elec-
tron is high, the electron cloud (electron density).

110

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Schrödinger’s equation required the use of quantum numbers to describe each
electron within an atom corresponding to the orbital size, shape, and orienta-
tion in space. Later it was found that one needed a quantum number associated
with the electron spin.

DeBroglie, in the mid 1920s, proposed the idea that particles could be treated
as waves by the relationship, ␭ ⫽ h/mv. This equation related the mass (m) and
velocity (v) of a particle to its wavelength (␭) by using Planck’s constant (h).

7-4 Quantum Numbers and Orbitals

The ﬁrst quantum number is the principle quantum number (n) that describes
the size of the orbital and relative distance from the nucleus. The possible val-
ues of n are positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, and so on). The smaller the value of n,
the lower the energy, and the closer the orbital is to the nucleus. We sometimes
refer to the principle quantum number as designating the shell the electron is
occupying.

Each shell contains one or more subshells, each with one or more orbitals. The
second quantum number is the angular momentum quantum number (l) that
describes the shape of the orbitals. Its value is related to the principle quantum
number and has allowed values of 0 to (n⫺1). For example, if n ⫽ 4, then the
possible values of l would be 0, 1, 2, and 3 (⫽ 4⫺1).
• If l ⫽ 0, then the orbital is called an s-orbital and has a spherical shape with
the nucleus at the center of the sphere. The greater the value of n, the larger
the sphere.

• If l ⫽ 1, then the orbital is called a p-orbital with two lobes of high electron

density on either side of the nucleus, for an hourglass or dumbbell shape.

• If l ⫽ 2, then the orbital is a d-orbital with a variety of shapes.
• If l ⫽ 3, then the orbital is an f-orbital with more complex shapes.

Quick Tip

Check your textbook for pictures of some or all of the orbitals.

Quantum Theory and Electrons

111

The third quantum number is the magnetic quantum number (ml). It describes
the  orientation  of  the  orbital  around  the  nucleus.  The  possible  values  of  ml
depend upon the value of the l quantum number. The allowed values for ml are
⫺l through 0 to ⫹l. For example, for l ⫽ 3, the possible values of ml would be
⫺3, ⫺2, ⫺1, 0, ⫹1, ⫹2, ⫹3. This is why, for example, if l ⫽ 1 (a p-orbital), there
are three p-orbitals (sublevels) corresponding to ml values of ⫺1, 0, ⫹1.

The fourth quantum number is the spin quantum number (ms) and indicates the
direction the electron is spinning. There are only two possible values for ms,
⫹1/2 and ⫺1/2.  When  two  electrons  are  to  occupy  the  same  orbital,  then  one
must have an ms ⫽ ⫹1/2 and the other electron must have an ms ⫽ ⫺1/2. These
are spin-paired electrons.

In  order  to  assign  the  four  quantum  numbers  for  a  particular  electron,  ﬁrst
begin with the electron in the lowest energy level, n ⫽ 1. Assign the value of n,
then the corresponding values of l, ml, and ﬁnally ms. Once you have ﬁnished all
the possible electrons at n ⫽ 1, repeat the procedure with n ⫽ 2. Don’t forget
about Hund’s rule and the Pauli exclusion principle. The quantum numbers for
the six electrons in carbon would be:

7-5 Electron Conﬁguration

Quantum mechanics may be used to determine the arrangement of the elec-
trons within an atom if two speciﬁc principles are applied: the Pauli exclusion
principle and the Aufbau principle. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no
two electrons in a given atom can have the same set of the four quantum num-
bers. For example, if an electron has the following set of quantum numbers:
n ⫽ 1, l ⫽ 0, ml ⫽ 0, and ms ⫽ ⫹1/2, then no other electron may have the same
set. The Pauli exclusion principle limits all orbitals to only two electrons. For
example, the 1s-orbital is ﬁlled when it has two electrons, so that any additional
electrons must enter another orbital. 

The second principle, the Aufbau principle, describes the order in which the
electrons enter the different orbitals and sublevels. The arrangement of elec-
trons builds up from the lowest energy level. The most stable arrangement of

112

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

electrons  has  all  the  electrons  with  the  lowest  possible  energy.  This  lowest
energy arrangement is the ground state. Less stable (higher energy) arrange-
ments are the excited states. An atom may have any number of excited state
arrangements, but there is only one ground state. 

When  following  the  Aufbau  principle,  the  orbitals  begin  ﬁlling  at  the  lowest
energy  and  continue  to  ﬁll  until  we  account  for  all  the  electrons  in  an  atom.
Filling begins with the n ⫽ 1 level followed by the n ⫽ 2 level, and then the n ⫽
3 level. However, there are exceptions in this sequence. In addition, Hund’s rule
states that the sublevels within a particular orbital will half ﬁll before the elec-
trons pair up in a sublevel. 

The  exceptions  begin  with  the  fourth  energy  level.  The  fourth  energy  level
begins to ﬁll before all the sublevels in the third shell are complete. More com-
plications in the sequence appear as the value of the principle quantum number
increases. The sequence of orbital ﬁlling, with complications, is: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s,
3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, and so on. 

Figure 7-1 illustrates the Aufbau principle diagrammatically. The orbitals begin
ﬁlling from the bottom of the diagram (lowest energy) with two electrons max-
imum per individual sublevel (line on the diagram).

Don’t Forget! 

The sublevels of a particular orbital half ﬁll before electrons pair up in the sub-
level.

There  are  several  ways  of  indicating  the  arrangement  of  the  electrons  in  an
atom. The most common way is the electron conﬁguration. The electron con-
ﬁguration requires the use of the n and l quantum numbers along with the num-
ber of electrons. The principle quantum number, n, is represented by an integer
(1, 2, 3 . . . ), and a letter represents the l quantum number (0 ⫽ s, 1 ⫽ p, 2 ⫽ d,
and 3 ⫽ f). Any s-subshell can hold a maximum of two electrons, any p-subshell
can hold up to six electrons, any d-subshell can hold a maximum of 10 electrons,
and any f-subshell can hold up to 14 electrons.

For example, lithium has three electrons, two in the 1s-orbital and one in the 2s
orbital. Its electron conﬁguration would be: 1s22s1

Don’t Forget! 

The sum of the superscripts must equal the total number of electrons present.

The electron conﬁguration for ﬂuorine (nine electrons) is: 1s22s22p5. Figure 7-2
shows one way of remembering the pattern for ﬁlling the atomic orbitals. (Your
text/instructor may present an alternate way of representing this pattern. Learn
the one that makes the most sense to you.) The ﬁlling begins at the top of the
pattern and follows the ﬁrst arrow. When you reach the end of the ﬁrst arrow,
you go to the second arrow and follow it to the end. The third arrow continues
the pattern, and so forth.

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Don’t Forget! 

Maximum number of electrons for s-subshells = 2, p-subshells = 6, d-subshells = 10,
f-subshells = 14.

Let’s use cobalt, Co, to illustrate how to use Figure 7-2. Cobalt has 27 electrons
(refer to its atomic number on the periodic table). Beginning at the top of the
ﬁgure, we see that the ﬁrst two electrons will ﬁll the 1s sublevel to give 1s2, leav-
ing 25 electrons. The next two electrons will enter the 2s sublevel giving 1s22s2,
leaving 23 electrons. Next is the 2p sublevel, which uses six electrons to give
1s22s22p6 and leaving 19 electrons. After the 2p is the 3s sublevel, which takes
two  electrons,  1s22s22p63s2,  leaving  15  electrons.  Filling  the  3p  sublevel  gives
1s22s22p63s23p6 with nine electrons to go. The 4s sublevel follows the 3p, giving
1s22s22p63s23p64s2 and leaving seven electrons. Finally, we reach the 3d sub-
level, which can hold 10 electrons. Since we only have seven electrons remain-
ing,  the  3d  sublevel  will  not  ﬁll.  The  ground-state  electron  conﬁguration  for
cobalt is: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d7.

There are a few exceptions to this general pattern. The two best-known excep-
tions are the elements chromium, Cr, and copper, Cu. The electron conﬁgura-
tions for these two elements are:

1s22s22p63s23p64s13d5
Cr
Cu 1s22s22p63s23p64s13d10

In both cases, the 4s sublevel is not ﬁlled even though there are electrons in
the  3d  sublevel.  In  a  later  chapter,  we  will  see  why  these  “exceptions”  are
predictable.

In some cases, it would be convenient to condense the electron conﬁgura-
tion.  In  this  condensed  form,  the  electronic  conﬁguration  of  the  previous
noble  gas  forms  a  core  represented  by  the  atomic  symbol  of  the  element
enclosed in brackets (i.e., [He] or [Ne]). The electrons added since the noble
gas, follow the noble gas core. For example, cobalt can be represented as an
argon core plus the 4s and 3d electrons. Thus, 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d7 becomes
[Ar]4s23d7.

Quantum Theory and Electrons

115

Don’t Forget! 

It is only the nearest previousnoble gas that is used as the core.

The electrons that are contained in the noble gas core are the core electrons
while the electrons outside the core are valence electrons. These valence electrons
are involved in the chemical behavior of the elements. For the representative
elements,  the  valence  electrons  are  those  s  and  p  electrons  in  the  outermost
energy level. The valence shell contains the valence electrons.

These problems require two constants, Planck’s constant (h ⫽ 6.63 ⫻ 10⫺34 J⭈s)
and the speed of light (c ⫽ 3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s). Your instructor may wish you to
memorize  these  constants;  however,  through  repeated  use  you  will  probably
learn these values without any further “memorization.”

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

116

Quick Tip

Some students mistakenly list the units of Planck’s constant as J/s. You should
be careful not to be one of these students.

When beginning a problem of this type you should, as always, carefully extract
the values (including units) from the question. You should then label each of
the extracted values with the appropriate symbol from the equation set. To help
in the assignment, pay attention to the units. The energy, E, will have units of J
or kJ. The frequency, ␯, will have units of 1/s ⫽ s⫺1 ⫽ Hz. The wavelength, ␭,
will always have units of length, usually m or nm, but also English units or Å.
Mass, m, may have any mass unit, and you will need to change this mass to kilo-
grams. Velocity, v, may have any units of distance (length) divided by any unit
of time. In most cases, you will need to convert the velocity to m/s.

Once you have extracted and labeled the values in the problem (including the
value being sought), you ﬁnish the problem by matching the symbols you have
with the given equations. After rearranging the equation, if necessary, you will
enter the appropriate values and conversions to get the ﬁnal answer.

In this chapter, you learned about the electronic structure of the atom in terms
of the older Bohr model and the newer quantum mechanical model. You learned
about the wave properties of matter, and how to describe each individual elec-
tron in terms of its four quantum numbers. You then learned how to write the
electron conﬁguration of an atom and some exceptions to the general rules.

2. How many different ground states may an atom have?
3. What are the maximum number of electrons that may occupy s-, p-, d-, and

Get Started

The goal of this chapter is to help you relate the properties of elements to their
position on the periodic table. These properties include ionization energies and
electron afﬁnities. You may want to review the basic structure of the periodic
table in Chapter 2 and electron conﬁgurations in Chapter 7. And Don’t forget!—
Practice, Practice, Practice.

8-1 Periodic Table Revisited

In  Chapter  2,  we  showed  you  the  arrangement  of  the  periodic  table.  The
columns  are  groups  or  families.  The  group  members  have  similar  chemical
properties and somewhat similar physical properties. The rows are periods. The
row members have predictably different properties. In Chapter 7, we showed
you the electron conﬁgurations of the elements. You learned how similar elec-
tron  conﬁgurations  lead  to  similar  chemical  properties.  There  are,  however,
other  periodic  properties.  These  properties  relate  to  the  magnitude  of  the
attractive force that the protons in the nucleus have for electrons. These include
atomic  radii,  ionization  energies,  and  electron  afﬁnities.  The  inner  electrons
(core electrons) somewhat screen the valence electrons from the attraction of
the  nucleus.  The  effective  nuclear  charge is  the  nuclear  charge  minus  the
screening effect of the core electrons. This screening is essentially constant for
all of the elements in any period on the periodic table. However, the screening
increases towards the bottom of any family.

The effective nuclear charge is useful in explaining most of the observed trends.
For example, there is a trend of decreasing atomic radii when moving from left to
right across any period on the periodic table. The atomic radius is the distance the
valence electrons are from the nucleus. In going from top to bottom on the peri-
odic table, each row adds an additional energy level. Thus, the valence electrons
are  farther  from  the  nucleus  and  the  atoms  increase  in  size.  (There  are  some
minor exceptions, especially in the transition metals.) The atomic radius decreases
when moving from left to right within a period. The nuclear charge is increasing
across the period. The number of core electrons is constant, so the screening is
constant. The effective nuclear charge is increasing due to the increase in nuclear
charge  minus  the  constant  screening.  This  increase  exerts  a  greater  attractive
force on the valence electrons. The increased attraction pulls the outer electrons
closer to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atom. 

Periodic Trends

8-2 Ionization Energy

Neutral atoms may gain or lose electrons to form ions. Ions are atoms (or groups
of atoms) that have an overall charge. We will only consider ions consisting of one
atom in this chapter. Ions of only one atom are monatomic ions. If electrons are
lost, the resultant ion has more protons than electrons and therefore has a posi-
tive charge. An ion having a positive charge is a cation. The cation has one posi-
tive  charge  for  each  electron  lost.  How  easily  one  or  more  electrons  are  lost
depends on the atomic radius and the effective nuclear charge. 

Don’t Forget! 

Atoms or groups of atoms may lose electrons to form positive ions, known as
cations.

The ionization energy (IE) is the energy required to remove an electron from a
gaseous atom in its lowest possible energy state, its ground state. This process
begins with the electrons furthest from the nucleus. It requires energy to over-
come  the  attractive  force  of  the  nucleus.  The  closer  the  electron  is  to  the
nucleus, the greater the attraction. The greater the attraction, the greater the
energy required to remove that electron. Therefore, ionization energies tend to
decrease going towards the bottom of a family. This is because the valence elec-
trons are farther from the nucleus. This is the reverse of the atomic radii trend.
Larger atoms have smaller ionization energies. 

It is possible to remove more than one electron. This yields a second or a third
IE, and so on. Successive ionization energies require more energy than the pre-
ceding one. This is true because the increase in positive charge creates a greater
attraction  for  the  remaining  electrons,  pulling  those  electrons  closer  to  the
nucleus. More energy is necessary to overcome this increased attraction.

Don’t Forget! 

Positives attract negatives. In order to pull the negative electron away from the
positive nucleus, energy will be required to break the attractive force.

122

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The IE increases from left to right across a period. This is because the effective
nuclear charge is increasing. This increase leads to a greater attraction, which
requires more energy to overcome. However, the trend is not linear. For exam-
ple,  in  the  second  period  there  are  peaks  at  beryllium,  Be,  nitrogen,  N,  and
neon, Ne. (Refer to your textbook for a graph of the IE trends.) These peaks in
ionization energies correspond to stable electron conﬁgurations of the atoms.
For  example,  the  electron  conﬁguration  of  beryllium  is  1s22s2.  It  has  a  ﬁlled
valence sublevel that provides additional stability. In nitrogen, the 2p sublevel
is  half-ﬁlled.  The  electrons  are  in  different  2p-orbitals.  Being  in  different
orbitals, they are as widely separated as possible. This separation minimizes the
repulsion among the negative charges. This leads to an increase in stability. The
increased stability leads to an increase in the IE. In neon, the second energy
level is full, making the electron conﬁguration particularly stable. High ioniza-
tion energies occur for stable electron conﬁgurations. The stable electron con-
ﬁgurations are ﬁlled shells and subshells, and half-ﬁlled subshells.

Ions, like atoms, have size. For ions, the term is ionic radii. For cations, the loss
of electrons results in a decrease in size, since (for the representative metals) an
entire energy level is usually lost. A sodium ion, Na⫹, is smaller than a sodium
atom. The greater the number of electrons removed, the greater the decrease
in radius. This applies to any element and its cations as illustrated by the trend
in radii of Fe > Fe2+ > Fe3⫹.

8-3 Electron Afﬁnity 

It is possible to add one or more electrons to an atom. This process yields an ion
with a negative charge. An ion with a negative charge is an anion. The energy
change  accompanying  the  addition  of  an  electron  to  a  gaseous  atom  in  its
ground state is the electron afﬁnity (EA). The ﬁrst EA may be endothermic,
exothermic, or even zero. The second EA is for the addition of a second elec-
tron.  Each  EA,  after  the  ﬁrst,  requires  more  energy.  This  is  because  the
approaching negative electron must overcome the repulsion of the negative ion
charge. Electron afﬁnities are less reliable than ionization energies. The reason
for this is that EAs are more difﬁcult to measure.

Don’t Forget! 

Atoms may gain electrons to form anions.

Periodic Trends

123

The general trend of electron afﬁnities is similar to the trend for ionization ener-
gies. Small atoms with a high effective nuclear charge have high EAs. The EAs
tend to increase going up a column. There is also an increase towards the right
on the periodic table. However, electron conﬁgurations complicate this trend.
The noble gases, such as, He and Ne, have essentially no electron afﬁnities. This
is due to their ﬁlled valence shells having no room for the electron. (Noble gases
do have ionization energies.) The alkaline earth metals, such as, Be and Mg, with
their ﬁlled s2 conﬁgurations have essentially no EA. Additional complications
appear when we consider elements other than the representative elements. 

The addition of one or more electrons inﬂuences the size of the ion formed. When
an atom gains electrons, it produces an anion having a larger ionic radius than the
original  atom.  The  more  electrons  added,  the  greater  the  increase  in  size.  For
example, we see the following trend in radii with oxygen: O < O⫺ < O2⫺. The effec-
tive nuclear charge is constant; however, the increasing number of electrons leads
to an increase in repulsion. This pushes the electrons further from the nucleus.

8-4 Utterly Confused About

Periodic Trends

Mendeleev  ﬁrst  developed  the  periodic  table  by  organizing  the  elements  to
emphasize trends in their chemical and physical properties. It is important that
you be able to recognize these trends also. There are general trends, such as the
fact that the atomic radii increase in size as you move down a family on the peri-
odic table. There are “exceptions,” such as the higher than expected ionization
energy  of  nitrogen.  In  most  cases,  you  will  only  need  to  know  the  general
trends. However, there may be times where you will need to explain an excep-
tion. Most of the exceptions involve a ﬁlled shell or subshell or a half-ﬁlled sub-
shell. These electron conﬁgurations are especially stable. The trends within the
transition elements are not often as regular as the representative elements.

Many of the trends in this chapter depend upon the strength of attraction of the
nucleus upon the electrons. There are two factors relating to this attraction. The
ﬁrst is the distance the electron is from the nucleus. The other is the effective
nuclear charge. These two factors are interdependent. An example of this inter-
dependence is the gradual decrease in the atomic radius within any period on
the periodic table. This decrease is due to the increase in the effective nuclear
charge as we move to the right across a period. While we can make predictions
concerning trends simply by looking at the relative position of an element on
the periodic table, any explanation of a relative value must involve the two fac-
tors of size and effective nuclear charge.

124

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Trends for the elements may be either horizontal or vertical. The combination
of these leads to diagonal relationships that increase either from the lower left
to the upper right on the periodic table or from the upper right to the lower left.
There are few trends that increase along another diagonal or that are only hor-
izontal or vertical. You should remember that the noble gases are not included
in some trends. In addition, hydrogen is often an exception to many trends.

There are two general classes of questions concerning periodic properties. One
type simply asks for ranking elements in either increasing or decreasing order.
You should be careful not to accidentally put the values in reverse order. Simply
locating the elements on the periodic table often allows answering this category
of question. Exceptions are usually not the focus. The other type asks for an
explanation of values. In this case, you will need to utilize atomic radius and the
effective nuclear charge. In many cases, the electron conﬁguration of the ele-
ments are involved. In this kind of question, position on the periodic table is
often not very important. To answer this type of question often requires you to
deal with one or more exceptions.

Another  type  of  question  may  ask  for  a  comparison  of  apparently  unrelated
information. For example, rank the following in order of increasing radius: Ne,
F⫺, and Na⫹. In this case, we are comparing ionic and atomic radii of elements
from the second and third periods on the periodic table. If we consider the elec-
tron conﬁguration of each of these species, we ﬁnd they are all 1s22s22p6. Since
the electron conﬁgurations are identical, the screenings of the core electrons
are identical. If there were no additional factors, all three of the species would
be identical in size. The cation, Na⫹, has a higher attraction for the electrons
due to its positive charge, which leads to an increase in the effective nuclear
charge. For this reason, the cation will be the smallest of the three. The anion,
F⫺, has additional repulsion due to the extra electron indicated by the charge.
This additional electron leads to an increase in repulsion of the electrons leading
to an increase in size. The anion is the largest of the three species. Thus, the
answer to the question is Na⫹ < Ne < F⫺.

There  are  other  exceptions.  For  example,  the  EA  of  ﬂuorine  is  lower  than
expected. This is because of the repulsion of the electrons in the small ﬂuoride
ion. If the ion were larger, the repulsion would be lower. The larger chlorine
atom has the highest EA of all the elements.

The  elements  on  the  periodic  table  exhibit  trends  in  ionization  energies  and
electron afﬁnities. These trends are related to the effective nuclear charge of
the atom. The ionization energy (IE) is the energy required to remove an elec-
tron from a gaseous atom in its ground state. The ionization energies tend to
decrease going down a family and increase from left to right across a period.
The energy change accompanying the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom

in its ground state is the electron afﬁnity (EA). The electron afﬁnities tend to
increase going up a family and are greater on the right side of the periodic table.
There  are  exceptions  for  the  trends  of  both  the  IE  and  EA.  Many  of  these
exceptions involve a ﬁlled shell or subshell or a half-ﬁlled subshell.

Get Started

The goal of this chapter is to help you gain an understanding of Lewis structures.
These are necessary to study chemical bonding, both ionic and covalent. You
might need to review the Section 2-3 on chemical formulas. Chapter 6 on Hess’s
law may also be helpful. Ionization energies and electron afﬁnities, from Chapter 8,
are also important. And remember: the only way to master this material is to
Practice, Practice, Practice. 

9-1 Lewis Symbols

Chemical compounds are pure substances composed of atoms in speciﬁc ratios
held together by chemical bonds. The basic principle that governs bonding is
the observed stability of the noble gas family (group VIIIA or group 18 ele-
ments).  Their  extreme  stability  is  related  to  the  fact  that  they  have  a  ﬁlled
valence shell. For all noble gases, except helium, this is a full complement of
8 valence electrons. This is the basis for the octet rule. During chemical reac-
tions, atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve an octet of
electrons in their outer shell. By this process, the elements become isoelectron-
ic with the closest noble gas. Isoelectronic means that the species have the same
number and arrangement of electrons. There are exceptions to the octet rule,
but most of the time it applies.

Don’t Forget! 

The octet rule doesn’t always work, but for the representative elements, it works
a majority of the time.

Don’t Forget! 

Here, as in most cases, hydrogen is an exception. Hydrogen achieves stability
with a pair instead of an octet.

Chemical Bonding

129

In Sections 9-3 and 9-4, we will show you two types of chemical bonds: ionic and
covalent.  It  is  important  to  be  able  to  represent  compounds  in  terms  of  the
atoms and valence electrons that make up the chemical species (compounds or
polyatomic ions). One of the best ways is to use Lewis symbols and structures.

The Lewis symbol, or Lewis electron-dot symbol, is a way of representing an
element and its valence electrons. To create a Lewis symbol, we begin by writ-
ing the element’s chemical symbol. This represents the atom’s nucleus and all
core electrons. We then add symbols, usually dots, indicating the valence elec-
trons around the atom’s symbol. We distribute the valence electron dots one at
a time around the symbol, placing the dots on either side, above, or below the
symbol.  This  continues  until,  if  necessary,  there  are  four  separate  electrons
present. If there are more than four electrons, you will need to pair the elec-
trons until you account for all the valence electrons. Figure 9-1 shows the Lewis
symbol for several different elements. We will be using Lewis symbols exten-
sively in the discussion of bonding, especially covalent bonding.

Quick Tip

For  the  representative  elements,  the  valence  electrons  are  all  electrons  in  the
outer s and p orbitals of an atom. A quick way of determining the number of
valence electrons is to locate the element on the periodic table. There are eight
columns of representative elements. The ﬁrst column, headed by H and Li, has
one valence electron, the second column has two, skip the transition elements,
the  next  column,  headed  by  B  and  Al,  has  three.  This  continues  to  the  last
(eighth) column where there are eight valence electrons. The only exception to
this procedure is helium, which only has two valence electrons.

In Chapter 2, we saw molecular and empirical formulas. Recall that the molec-
ular formula indicates the kind and actual number of atoms present. The empir-
ical  formula simply  shows  the  kind  of  atoms  present  and  their  lowest  whole
number  ratio.  In  this  chapter,  structural  formulas  are  important.  The  Lewis
formula of a compound is an example of a structural formula. A structural for-
mula shows the number and type of atoms present, as well as the bonding pat-
tern.  The  bonding  pattern  shows  which  atoms  bond  to  each  other.  It  usually

9-2 Electronegativity

In many cases, you will need to predict the type of bond present. We will be giv-
ing you several tips along the way to help you decide. Electronegativity is a tool
that you can use in predicting bond type. This tool will also help you to make
other predictions.

Electronegativity is a measure of the attractive force that an atom in a com-
pound exerts on electrons in a bond. You may ﬁnd electronegativity values in a
table in your textbook. There are two trends in these values. In general, elec-
tronegativities increase going towards the right on the periodic table (excluding
the noble gases). The values also increase towards the top. These trends com-
bine and lead to ﬂuorine being the most electronegative element. The nearer an
element is to ﬂuorine, the higher its electronegativity. 

You will need to know the electronegativity difference between the atoms. The
key to the type of bond formed is this difference. A mostly ionic bond is pres-
ent  when  there  is  a  large  electronegativity  difference.  “Large,”  according  to
Pauling,  refers  to  a  difference  greater  than  1.7.  If  the  difference  is  zero,  the
bond  is  covalent.  Anything  in  between  these  extremes  is  polar  covalent.
(See Section 9-4 for a discussion of these bond types.) You do not need to know
the actual electronegativity values. The further apart two elements appear on
the periodic table, the greater the electronegativity difference. Widely separated
elements usually form ionic bonds.

Quick Tip

If the atoms are widely separated on the periodic table (metals and nonmetals),
the  bonding  is  most  likely  ionic.  Nonmetals  close  together  are  likely  to  form
covalent bonds.

Chemical Bonding

131

9-3 Ionic Bonds and Lattice Energy

Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. The
more electronegative element gains electrons. The less electronegative element
loses electrons. This results in the formation of cations and anions. Usually, an
ionic bond forms between a metal and a nonmetal. The metal loses electrons to
form a cation. The nonmetal gains electrons to become an anion. The attraction
of the opposite charges forms an ionic solid. 

Don’t Forget!

Cations have a positive charge and anions have a negative charge.

Quick Tip

Elements on the left side of the periodic table (the metals) react with elements
on the right side (the nonmetals) to form ionic compounds (salts).

The  number  of  electrons  lost  or  gained  depends  on  the  number  of  electrons
necessary to lead to an octet. In general, an atom can gain or lose one or two
and on rare occasions three electrons, but not more than that. Potassium, K, has
one valence electron in energy level 4. If it loses that one, it only has three ﬁlled
shells remaining. The outer shell has an octet. Bromine, Br, has seven valence
electrons, so if it gains one electron it will have its octet. A chemical reaction
takes place between the potassium and bromine with an electron moving from
the potassium atom to the bromine atom—completing the octet for both. In this
manner, the ionic compound potassium bromide, KBr, forms.

The  reaction  of  magnesium,  with  two  valence  electrons,  and  chlorine,  with
seven  valence  electrons  will  produce  magnesium  chloride.  The  magnesium
must donate one valence electron to each of two chlorine atoms. This leaves a
magnesium ion and two chloride ions. All the ions have a complete octet. The
ions form the ionic compound magnesium chloride, MgCl2.

and that the formula has the lowest whole number ratio of elements.

The  total  number  of  electrons  lost  must  equal  the  total  number  of  electrons
gained. The reaction of aluminum with oxygen produces aluminum oxide. The
aluminum has three valence electrons to lose. The oxygen has six valence elec-
trons and needs two. The lowest common factor between 3 and 2 is 6. It requires
two aluminum atoms, losing three electrons each, to supply six electrons. It will
require three oxygen atoms, gaining two electrons each, to account for the six
electrons.  The  resultant  compound,  aluminum  oxide,  has  the  formula  Al2O3.
All ions present have an octet of electrons.

The formation of ions requires energy. The reaction cannot occur if insufﬁcient
energy is available. The source of the necessary energy is the lattice energy. The
lattice energy is deﬁned as the energy required to separate the ions in 1 mol of
an ionic solid. There are ways of estimating the lattice energy, but we often ﬁnd
lattice energies by applying Hess’s law. You learned how to apply Hess’s law in
Chapter 6. A Born-Haber cycle represents the application of Hess’s law to the
determination of lattice energies.

9-4 Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonding is the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons by two atoms.
The  covalent  bonds  in  a  molecule;  a  covalently  bonded  compound  are  repre-
sented by a dash. Each dash is a shared pair of electrons. These covalent bonds
may be single bonds, one pair of shared electrons as in H-H; double bonds, two
shared pairs of electrons as in H2C:CH2; or triple bonds, three shared pairs of
electrons, :NæN:. It is the same driving force to form a covalent bond as an ionic
bond—completion of the atom’s octet. In the case of the covalent bond, the shar-
ing of electrons leads to both atom utilizing the electrons towards their octet.

Chemical Bonding

Quick Tip

133

Never put more than three covalent bonds between a pair of atoms.

In  the  hydrogen  molecule,  H2,  the  atoms  share  the  electrons  equally.  Each
hydrogen nucleus has one proton equally attracting the bonding pair of elec-
trons. A bond like this is a nonpolar covalent bond, or simply a covalent bond.
In cases where the two atoms involved in the covalent bond are not the same,
then the attraction is not equal. The bonding electrons are pulled more toward
the atom with the greater attraction (more electronegative atom). This bond is
a polar covalent bond. The atom that has the greater attraction takes on a par-
tial negative charge and the other atom a partial positive charge. 

Relative electronegativity values are important here. It is important to know
which element has the greater attraction for the electrons. This is the atom with
the greater electronegativity. Consider for example, hydrogen ﬂuoride, HF. The
ﬂuorine has a greater attraction for the bonding pair of electrons. For this rea-
son, it takes on a partial negative charge. This will leave the hydrogen with a
partial positive charge. The presence of partial charges gives a polar covalent
bond. Many times, we use an arrow, in place of a dash, to represent this type of
bond. The head of the arrow points toward the atom that has the greater attrac-
tion for the electron pair: 

d⫹H S Fd⫺

The charges formed are not full charges as found in ions. These are only partial
charges, indicated by a delta, d. Many times these polar bonds are responsible
for the entire molecule being polar. The molecule is polar if it has a negative
end and a positive end. Polar molecules attract other polar molecules, and this
attraction may greatly inﬂuence the properties of that substance. (We will see
the consequences of this in Chapter 11.)

A  Lewis  structure  can  show  the  bonding  pattern  in  a  covalent  compound.  In
Lewis formulas, we show the valence electrons that are not involved in bonding
as  dots  surrounding  the  element  symbols.  The  valence  electrons  involved  in
bonding are present as dashes. There are several ways of deriving the Lewis struc-
ture, but here is one that works well for most compounds that obey the octet rule.

Draw the Lewis structural formula for CH4O.

First, write a general framework for the molecule. In this case, the carbon bonds
to the oxygen since hydrogen can only form one bond. 

Quick Tip

Hydrogen is never the central atom.

Quick Tip

Normally the atom needing the greater number of electrons to achieve an octet
is the central atom. If two atoms need the same number of electrons, the larger
is usually the central atom.

Carbon usually forms four bonds, hydrogen forms one bond, and oxygen gener-
ally forms two bonds.

bonds = S/2 = 10/2 = 5

The  result,  5,  indicates  that  there  are  ﬁve  bonds  present  in  this  compound.  You
should begin by placing one bond (pair of electrons) between each pair of atoms.
Use a dash to represent a bond. If you still have bonds remaining after placing a dash
between each pair of atoms, it means you have double or triple bonds. Next, dis-
tribute the remaining available electrons around the atoms so that each atom has its
full octet, 8 electrons (either bonding or nonbonding, shared or not). Hydrogen is an
exception; it only gets 2. Figure 9-2 shows the Lewis structural formula of CH4O.

that all atoms, except hydrogen, are going to obey the octet rule.

It is also possible to write a Lewis structure for polyatomic anions or cations. The
N ⫺ A = S rule can be used, but for an anion extra electrons equal to the magni-
tude of the negative charge must be added to the electrons available. If the ion is
a cation, you will need to subtract  number of electrons equal to the charge.

9-5 Resonance

Sometimes when writing the Lewis structure of a species, we may draw more
than  one  possible  “correct”  Lewis  structure  for  a  molecule.  The  nitrate  ion,
⫺, is a good example. The structures that we write for this polyatomic anion
NO3
differ in which oxygen has a double bond to the nitrogen. None of these three
truly represents the actual structure of the nitrate ion—it is an average of all
three of these Lewis structures. We use resonance theory to describe this situa-
tion. Resonance occurs when more than one Lewis structure (without moving
atoms) is possible for a molecule. The individual structures are called resonance
structures  (or  forms)  and  are  written  with  a  two-headed  arrow  (i)  between
them. The three resonance forms of the nitrate ion are:

Quick Tip

When  you  draw  resonance  structures,  you  can  only  move  electrons  (bonds).
Never move the atoms.

Again, let us emphasize that the actual structure of the nitrate ion is not any of
the three shown. It is not ﬂipping back and forth among the three. It is an aver-
age of all three. All the bonds are the same, and are intermediate between sin-
gle bonds and double bonds in strength and length.

Don’t Forget!

When writing the Lewis structures of polyatomic ions, don’t forget to show their
ionic charge.

Chemical Bonding

137

9-6 Bond Energy and Bond Length

The reason bonds form is that bonded species are more stable than nonbonded
species. Since bonds are stabilizing factors, it requires energy to break a bond.
The bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. Since bond energy is
the  energy  required,  the  values  are  always  positive  (endothermic).  We  also
know that if energy is necessary to break a bond, the reverse process, the for-
mation of a bond releases an equivalent amount of energy.

Bond energies, found in tables such as your textbook, are average values. In a
particular molecule, the actual bond energies may be larger or smaller than the
average. The values will always be greater than the average if resonance is pres-
ent. The strength of a bond depends upon the identity of the atoms involved
and the type of bond, increasing in the order: single, double, or triple bond.

When we use bond energies to estimate the heat of reaction, we need to have the
values for all the bonds broken and for all the bonds formed. The bonds broken
are all the bonds in the reactants, and the bonds formed are all the bonds in the
products. The difference between these energy totals is the heat of reaction:

⌬H = ⌺ energies of bonds broken ⫺ ⌺ energies of bonds formed

The bond  length is  the  distance  between  the  two  atomic  nuclei  of  the  atoms
involved in the bond. The bond length is an average distance and varies with the
atoms involved and the type of bond, decreasing in the order: single, double, or
triple bond. It is important to realize that a double bond is not twice the strength
or half the length of a single bond. Without looking at tabulated values, we can
simply say that double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds.

9-7 Utterly Confused About

Lewis Structures

Let’s  work  two  examples  illustrating  the  steps  necessary  to  produce  a  good
Lewis structure. We will take HNO2 and XeF4 for these examples. The ﬁrst mol-
ecule is nitrous acid. It is an example of an oxyacid. (Oxyacids are compounds
containing hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element.) The other compound is
xenon tetraﬂuoride.

There is more than one way to arrange the atoms in nitrous acid. However, only
one will lead to a good Lewis structure. You should avoid any arrangement that
places identical atoms adjacent. Identical atoms, other than carbon, rarely bond

138

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

to each other unless there is no alternative. This is an oxyacid. The hydrogen is
acidic. When you arrange the atoms for an oxyacid, the acidic hydrogens will
always attach to an oxygen atom. This oxygen atom will have only one hydro-
gen atom attached. This oxygen will also attach to the other element in the com-
pound. If there is more than one acidic hydrogen atom, attach one to a separate
oxygen atom. The resultant order of atoms that you get might be HONO. It
does not matter to which oxygen you attach the hydrogen atom. The arrange-
ment ONOH is the same as HONO. You may arrange these atoms in a hori-
zontal arrangement as done here, or a vertical arrangement, or . . . . It makes no
difference. We will use the ﬁrst arrangement in this example.

Quick Tip

When you begin a Lewis structure, do not place identical atoms adjacent to each
other unless there is no alternative. Carbon is the only common exception. Most
compounds containing more than one carbon atom will have the carbon atoms
adjacent to each other.

Quick Tip

When drawing the Lewis structure of an oxyacid, you should place one acidic
hydrogen atom on a separate oxygen atom.

We know that there needs to be at least one bond between each pair of atoms.
We also know that the bond from hydrogen to the adjacent oxygen will be the
only bond to the hydrogen atom. This information should be on your mind as
you move on to complete the structure.

If you wish to apply the S ⫽ N ⫺ A rule, you will need to assign values to N and
A. To ﬁnd N, we use 2 for hydrogen and 8 for each of the other three atoms. This
gives N ⫽ 2 ⫹ 3(8) ⫽ 26. The determination of A uses 1 for hydrogen, 5 for nitro-
gen, and 6 for each oxygen atom. This gives A ⫽ 1 ⫹ 5 ⫹ 2(6) ⫽ 18. Using the
values for N and A, we ﬁnd S ⫽ 26 ⫺ 18 ⫽ 8. If S ⫽ 8, then there are S/2 ⫽
4 bonds. We can place one bond between each pair of atoms to get H-O-N-O.
This arrangement accounts for three of the four bonds. Since there is one more
bond to account for, we need to create a double bond. The double bond cannot

Chemical Bonding

139

involve the hydrogen since it already has the one and only bond that it can have.
The oxygen next to the hydrogen is not a likely candidate since it already has two
bonds. The most likely candidate for another bond is the other oxygen atom. We
can add this bond, which changes the N-O bond to a double bond. The bonding
arrangement is now H-O-N=O. The four bonds, at two electrons each, account
for eight of the available electrons (A). To ﬁnish the structure, we need to add the
remaining 10 electrons (A ⫺ 8). Usually electrons come in pairs, so our 10 elec-
trons will appear as 5 pairs. We will begin with the oxygen atoms since oxygen is
the most electronegative element in this compound. (The most electronegative
elements will get its octet.) Each oxygen atom has 2 bonds (4 electrons), so each
needs 4 electrons (2 pairs). We need to add two separate pairs to each oxygen
atom. It is not too important where you place the pairs as long as you do not place
the electrons between the oxygen and another atom. These pairs account for 8
more electrons. The remaining 2 electrons constitute one more pair. This pair will
probably go on the nitrogen, but you should check to make sure. The nitrogen
atom  has  3  bonds  (6  electrons),  and  it  needs  2  more  to  achieve  an  octet.
Therefore, we can add our last 2 electrons as a pair on the nitrogen. The posi-
tioning of the pair is not important. Do not add the two electrons separately.

Quick Tip

All the available electrons, A, must appear in the ﬁnal Lewis structure. They will
normally appear in pairs unless there are an odd number of electrons. If the num-
ber of electrons is odd, there will be only one unpaired electron.

The ﬁnal Lewis structure for nitrous acid is:

Η

Ο

Ν

O

In this structure, we have two central atoms. The nitrogen is one, and the oxy-
gen with the hydrogen is the other. 

Now we will begin drawing the Lewis structure of XeF4. Xenon will be the cen-
tral atom, and we will arrange ﬂuorine atoms around it. In this way, we avoid
attaching identical atoms to each other. We will need a bond between the cen-
tral xenon and each of the ﬂuorine atoms. This arrangement means there will
be at least four bonds.

If you wish to apply the S ⫽ N ⫺ A rule, you will need to assign values to N and
A. To ﬁnd N, we use 8 for xenon and 8 for each of the ﬂuorine atoms. This gives

140

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

N ⫽ 8 ⫹ 4(8) ⫽ 40. The determination of A uses 8 for xenon and 7 for each ﬂu-
orine atom. This gives A ⫽ 8 ⫹ 4(7) ⫽ 36. Using the values for N and A, we
ﬁnd S ⫽ 40 ⫺ 36 ⫽ 4. If S ⫽ 4, then there are S/2 ⫽ 2 bonds. This is a problem
since we already know we need at least 4 bonds. This means that we have a
compound that is an exception to the octet rule.

Quick Tip

In a compound that is an exception to the octet rule, there is usually only one
atom,  other  than  hydrogen,  that  is  an  exception.  There  are  few  nonhydrogen
compounds with more than one exception present.

Even though we have an exception, we can still complete the Lewis structure.
We need to draw a bond from each of the ﬂuorine atoms to the central xenon.
This gives us 4 bonds and uses 8 electrons. Each ﬂuorine atom needs to com-
plete its octet. The bond accounts for 2 electrons, so we need 6 more electrons
(3 pairs) for each. Therefore, we add 3 separate pairs to each of the ﬂuorine
atoms. Six electrons per ﬂuorine times 4 ﬂuorine atoms accounts for 24 elec-
trons. Our Lewis structure now contains 8 ⫹ 24 ⫽ 32 electrons. The number of
available  electrons  (A)  is  36,  so  we  still  need  to  add  36  ⫺ 32 ⫽ 4  electrons.
These 4 electrons will give us 2 pairs. The xenon atom will get these pairs and
become an exception to the octet rule. The actual placement of the pairs is not
important as long as it is obvious that they are with the central atoms and not
one of the ﬂuorine atoms. The ﬁnal Lewis structure is:

Quick Tip

When you are not certain where to put electrons, remember that the most elec-

Chemical Bonding

Quick Tip

141

Elements in the ﬁrst two rows on the periodic table will never exceed an octet.
If they are exceptions to the octet rule, they will have less than an octet.

Lewis symbols and structures are a type of structural formula in which shared
pairs of electrons are represented by dashes and unshared electrons are shown
as dots. The Lewis structure may be generated by the use of the N ⫺ A ⫽ S rule
(assuming the octet rule is obeyed). The electronegativity of an element is the
measure of the attraction that an element has on the electrons in a bond. If
the  difference  in  electronegativity  between  the  two  elements  sharing  one  or
more electron pairs is greater than 1.7, the bond is classified as ionic, less
than 1.7 polar covalent and 0 pure covalent. Resonance occurs when there is
more than one equivalent Lewis structure possible for a molecule. In general,
single bonds are longer and weaker than double bonds, while triple bonds are
the shortest and strongest.

Get Started

The main goal of this chapter is to help you master electron and molecular geom-
etry and hybridization. This will lead to information on the polarity of molecules.
You might want to review Section 7-5 on electron conﬁguration. Section 9-7 on
writing  Lewis  structures  is  also  important.  Don’t  Forget!—Practice,  Practice,
Practice.

10-1 Molecular Geometry (VSEPR)

In Chapter 9, we indicated that the Lewis structure showed the bonding pattern
of a molecule, but not necessarily its shape. The shape of a molecule greatly
inﬂuences its properties. One method to predict the shape of molecules is the
valence-shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory. The basis of this theory
is that the valence shell electron pairs around a central atom will try to move as
far  away  from  each  other  as  possible.  This  includes  electrons  in  bonds  and
elsewhere.  The  electrons  do  this  to  minimize  the  repulsion  between  the  like
(negative) charges. We will actually determine two geometries. The ﬁrst is the
electron-group (pair) geometry. The electron group geometry considers all elec-
tron pairs surrounding a nucleus. The second is the molecular geometry. In this
case, the nonbonding electrons (electron lone pairs) become “invisible.” We
consider only the arrangement of the atomic nuclei. For the purposes of geom-
etry, double and triple bonds count the same as single bonds. 

In order to determine the electron-group and molecular geometry:

1. Write the Lewis electron-dot formula of the compound.
2. Determine the number of electron pair groups surrounding the central atom(s).

Remember that double and triple bonds count the same as a single bond.

3. Determine the geometric shape that maximizes the distance between the

electron groups. This is the electron-group geometry.

4. Mentally allow the nonbonding electrons to become invisible. They are still
present  and  are  still  repelling  the  other  electron  pairs.  However,  we  just
don’t  “see”  them.  We  then  determine  the  molecular  geometry  from  the
arrangement of bonding pairs around the central atom.

Figure 10-1 shows the electron-group and molecular geometry for 2 to 6 elec-
tron pairs.

For example, let’s determine the electron-group and molecular geometry of car-
bon dioxide, CO2, and water, H2O. At ﬁrst glance, you might imagine that the
geometry of these two compounds would be similar since both have a central
atom with two groups (atoms) attached. However, let’s see if that is true. 

First, write the Lewis structure of each. Figure 10-2 shows the Lewis structures
of these compounds.

bon dioxide and water

Next, determine the electron group geometry of each. For carbon dioxide, there
are two electron groups around the carbon. Two electron pairs is a linear struc-
ture. For water, there are four electron pairs around the oxygen, two bonding,
and two nonbonding electron pairs. The presence of four total pairs gives tetra-
hedral electron-group geometry.

Finally,  mentally  allow  the  nonbonding  electron  pairs  to  become  invisible.
What  remains  is  the  molecular  geometry.  For  carbon  dioxide,  all  groups  are
involved in bonding. There are no “invisible” groups. This means the electron-
group and the molecular geometry are the same (linear). However, water has
two nonbonding pairs of electrons (now invisible). The remaining bonding elec-
tron  pairs  (and  hydrogen  nuclei)  are  in  a  bent  molecular  arrangement.  The
angle  between  these  pairs  is  similar  to  that  in  the  tetrahedral  structure.  The
presence of lone pairs makes the angle slightly smaller.

Determining the molecular geometry of carbon dioxide and water also explains
why their polarities are different. Carbon dioxide is not polar and water is. This
is true even though both are composed of polar covalent bonds. To be a polar
molecule, one end must have a partial positive charge (d⫹) and the other must
have a partial negative charge (d⫺). Carbon dioxide, because of its linear shape,
has partial negative charges at both ends and a partial positive charge in the
middle. Water, because of its bent shape, has a partial negative end, the oxygen,
and a partial positive end, the hydrogen side. Carbon dioxide does not have a
partial  positive  end.  The  polarity  of  the  molecule  is  important  because  polar
molecules attract other polar molecules. This may dramatically affect the prop-
erties of that substance. This is true with water. (See Chapter 11 for a discussion
of water and intermolecular forces.)

Molecular Geometry and Hybridization

149

Don’t Forget!

In using the VSEPR theory to determine the molecular geometry, start ﬁrst with
the electron group geometry, make the nonbonding electrons mentally invisible
and then describe what remains.

10-2 Valence Bond Theory (Hybridization)

VSEPR  theory  is  one  way  to  determine  the  molecular  geometry.  Another
method  involves  using  valence  bond  theory.  Valence  bond  theory describes
covalent bonding in terms of the blending of atomic orbitals to form new types
of orbitals, hybrid orbitals. Hybrid orbitals are orbitals formed due to the com-
bining of the atomic orbitals of the central atom. The total number of orbitals
does not change. The number of hybrid orbitals equals the number of atomic
orbitals used. The type of hybrid orbitals formed depends on the number and
type of atomic orbitals used. Figure 10-3 shows the hybrid orbitals resulting from
the mixing of s-, p-, and d-orbitals. The atoms share electrons through the over-
lapping of their orbitals. Any combination of overlapping orbitals is acceptable.

Figure 10-3 Hybridization of s-, p-, and d-orbitals

sp hybridization results from the overlap of one s-orbital with one p-orbital. Two
sp hybrid orbitals form with a bond angle of 180o. This is a linear orientation.
sp2 hybridization results  from  the  overlap  of  one  s-orbital  with  two  p-
orbitals. Three sp2 hybrid orbitals form with a trigonal planar orientation and

150

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

a bond angle of 120o. This type of bonding occurs in the formation of the C-
to-C double bond as in CH2=CH2.
sp3 hybridization results  from  the  mixing  on  one  s-orbital  and  three  p-
orbitals, resulting in four sp3 hybrid orbitals with a tetrahedral geometric ori-
entation. We ﬁnd this sp3 hybridization in carbon when it forms four single
bonds with a bond angle of 109.5⬚.
sp3d hybridization results from the blending of one s-orbital, three p-orbitals
and one d-orbital. The result is ﬁve sp3d orbitals with a trigonal bipyramidal
orientation., with bond angles of 90⬚ and 120⬚. This type of bonding occurs in
compounds like PCl5, an exception to the octet rule.
sp3d2 hybridization occurs when one s, three p, and two d-orbitals mix giving
an octahedral arrangement. SF6 is an example. Again, this is an exception to
the octet rule. If one starts with this structure and one of the bonding pairs
becomes a lone pair, a square pyramidal shape results; two lone pairs gives a
square planar shape. The bond angle is 90⬚.

Figure 10-4 shows the hybridization that occurs in ethylene, H2C=CH2. Each
carbon has sp2 hybridization. On each carbon, two of the hybrid orbitals over-
lap with an s-orbital on a hydrogen atom to form a carbon-to-hydrogen cova-
lent bond. The third sp2 hybrid orbital overlaps with the sp2 hybrid on the other
carbon to form a carbon-to-carbon covalent bond. Note that each carbon has a
remaining p-orbital that has not undergone hybridization. These are also over-
lapping above and below a line joining the carbons. 

Figure 10-4 Hybridization in ethylene H2C=CH2

In ethylene, there are two types of bonds. Sigma (s) bonds have the overlap of
the orbitals on a line between the two atoms involved in the covalent bond. In
ethylene,  the  C-H  bonds  and  one  of  the  C-C  bonds  are  sigma  bonds.  Pi (p)
bonds have  the  overlap  of  orbitals  above  and  below  a  line  through  the  two
nuclei of the atoms involved in the bond. A double bond is always composed of
one sigma and one pi bond. A carbon-to-carbon triple bond results from the

Molecular Geometry and Hybridization

151

overlap of one sp hybrid orbital and two p-orbitals on one carbon with the same
on the other carbon. This results in one sigma bond (overlap of the sp hybrid
orbitals) and two pi bonds (overlap of two sets of p-orbitals).

10-3 Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory 

Another covalent bonding model is molecular orbital (MO) theory. In MO the-
ory, atomic orbitals on the individual atoms combine to form molecular orbitals
(MOs).  These  are  not  hybrid  orbitals.  An  MO  covers  the  entire  molecule.
Molecular orbitals have deﬁnite shapes and energies. The combination of two
atomic  orbitals  produces  two  MOs.  (The  total  number  of  orbitals  never
changes.) One of the MOs is a bonding MO. The other is an antibonding MO.
The bonding MO has a lower energy than the original atomic orbitals. The anti-
bonding MO has a higher energy. Lower energy orbitals are more stable than
higher energy orbitals.

Once the MO forms, electrons enter. We add electrons using the same rules we
used for electron conﬁgurations. The lower energy orbitals ﬁll ﬁrst. There are a
maximum  of  two  electrons  per  orbital.  Orbitals  of  equal  energy  will  half-ﬁll
orbitals  before  pairing  electrons.  When  two  s  atomic  orbitals  combine  two
sigma (s) MOs form. One is sigma bonding (s). The other is sigma antibond-
ing (s*). Figure 10-5 shows the MO diagram for H2.

Figure 10-5 Molecular orbital diagram of H2

Note that the two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) have both gone
into the sigma bonding MO. We can determine the bonding situation in MO
theory by calculating the MO bond order. The MO bond order is the number

152

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

of  electrons  in  bonding  MOs  minus  the  number  of  electrons  in  antibonding
MOs, divided by 2. For H2 in Figure 10-5, the bond order would be (2 ⫺ 0)/2 ⫽
1. A stable bonding situation exists between two atoms when the bond order is
greater than zero. The larger the bond order, the stronger the bond.

When two sets of p-orbitals combine, one sigma bonding and one sigma anti-
bonding  MO  are  formed  along  with  two  bonding  pi  MOs  and  two  pi  anti-
bonding (p*) MOs. Figure 10-6 shows the MO diagram for O2. For the sake of

trons of O2

153

simplicity, the 1s orbitals of each oxygen and MOs have not been shown here,
just the valence electron orbitals.

The bond order for O2 would be (10 ⫺ 6)/2 ⫽ 2.

Don’t Forget!

To count the bonding and antibonding electrons at energy level 1.

Don’t Forget!

When adding electrons to MOs, add them to the lowest energy orbital ﬁrst. If the
orbitals have equal energies remember to half-ﬁll the orbitals and then pair-up
the electrons.

In order to predict the molecular geometries, you must have a correct Lewis
structure. We will begin with the structure of nitrous acid. There are two cen-
tral atoms in this structure: the nitrogen and the oxygen atom with the hydro-
gen attached. We will begin with the nitrogen atom. This atom has an octet of
electrons surrounding it. It has a lone pair and three bonding pairs distributed
between a single and two double bonds. To predict the electron-group geome-
try, we count one for the lone pair, one for the single bond, and one for the

154

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

double  bond.  This  gives  a  total  of  three.  Three  pairs  give  a  trigonal  planar
electron-group geometry, they also imply an sp2 hybridization. A trigonal pla-
nar electron-group geometry with one lone pair leaves us with a bent molecu-
lar geometry. As a bent species, with atoms of differing electronegativities, it is
polar.

If we examine the other central atom, the oxygen with the attached hydrogen,
we observe the presence of two lone pairs and two bonds. The presence of these
pairs and bonds, which total four, means that the electron-group geometry is
tetrahedral. This arrangement has sp3 hybridization. Since there are two lone
pairs, the molecular geometry is bent. 

An  examination  of  the  xenon  tetraﬂuoride  structure  shows  that  the  central
atom, the xenon, has four bonds and two lone pairs. Six groups lead to an octa-
hedral electron-group geometry. In this case, the hybridization is sp3d2. There
are two lone pairs; so, the molecular geometry is square planar. This geometry
indicates  that  even  though  the  bonds  are  polar  covalent,  their  arrangement
leads to a nonpolar molecule.

The number of pairs of electrons surrounding the central atom primarily deter-
mines the shape of a molecule, its molecular geometry. You may determine this
by  ﬁrst  determining  the  Lewis  structure  of  the  molecule  and  then  applying
VSEPR theory. VSEPR theory assumes that the electron pairs surrounding the
central  atom  will  assume  a  geometry  that  minimizes  the  repulsion  between
them. Another method of determining the molecular shape is to use valance
bond theory in which individual atomic orbitals blend to form hybrid orbitals.
Molecular orbital theory is a way of describing covalent bonding in a molecule
in terms of the combining of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals.

Get Started

The  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to  help  you  learn  about  intermolecular  forces.
Intermolecular forces are interactions between atoms, molecules, and/or ions.
We can use these forces to explain both macroscopic and microscopic properties
of matter.

The state of matter in which a substance exists depends upon two factors. One
of  these  factors  is  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  particles.  The  other  factor  is  the
intermolecular forces between the particles. The average kinetic energy of the
molecules  relates  directly  to  the  temperature.  Kinetic  energy  tends  to  move
particles  away  from  each  other.  As  the  temperature  increases,  the  average
kinetic energy increases. When the kinetic energy increases, the particles move
faster.  In  a  solid,  the  intermolecular  forces  are  sufﬁciently  great  to  minimize
particle  movement.  When  the  temperature  increases,  the  kinetic  energy
increases  and  eventually  will  overcome  the  intermolecular  forces.  The  sub-
stance might in fact melt. While a substance is melting, the temperature remains
constant even though we are adding energy. The temperature at which the solid
converts into the liquid state is the melting point (mp). Melting is an example
of a change in state. Changes of state, called phase changes, depend on the tem-
perature. In some cases, the pressure can also inﬂuence these changes. 

Quick Tip

The melting point of a substance and its freezing point (fp) are identical.

In this chapter, we will concentrate on the solid and liquid states. It may be use-
ful to review the section in Chapter 10 that deals with the polarity of molecules.
And again, Practice, Practice, Practice.

11-1 Types of Intermolecular Forces

Intermolecular forces are attractive or repulsive forces between atoms, mole-
cules, and/or ions. The attractive forces compete with the randomizing factor of
kinetic energy. The structure that a particular substance exhibits depends on the

Intermolecular Forces, Solids and Liquids

159

strength and type of intermolecular forces present. Before we begin examining
the different types of intermolecular forces, you may wish to skim Chapter 9 on
bonding. It is important to recognize which molecules are polar and which are
not. Polar molecules have partial positive and partial negative ends. Polar mol-
ecules have a dipole. These dipoles are one of the major factors involved in the
intermolecular forces. 

Covalent, metallic, and ionic bonds are very strong interactions. Some people
consider these to be intermolecular forces. The following are weaker intermol-
ecular forces. They appear in approximate order of decreasing strength. Even
though weaker than bonds, they are nonetheless important.

Don’t Forget!

Intermolecular forces occur between molecules not within molecules. For exam-
ple, covalent bonds hold a water molecule together, but intermolecular forces,
not covalent bonds, attract separate water molecules to each other.

Ion-Dipole Intermolecular Forces
This attraction is due to the attraction of an ion (cation or anion) with one end
of a polar molecule (dipole). This type of attraction is especially important in
aqueous salt solutions where the ion attracts water molecules and may form a
hydrated ion (i.e., Al(H2O)6

3⫹).

Quick Tip

The  ion-dipole  intermolecular  force  is  different;  in  that  two  different  species
must be present: an ion from one species and a polar molecule from a different
species.

Dipole-Dipole Intermolecular Forces
This attraction occurs between two polar molecules. It results from the attrac-
tion of the positive end of one dipole to the negative end of another dipole. For

160

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

example, gaseous hydrogen chloride, HCl(g), has a dipole. The hydrogen end
has a partial positive charge and the chlorine end has a partial negative charge.
The chlorine is more electronegative so it has the partial negative charge. The
partial-positive  end  of  one  HCl  molecule  attracts  the  partial-negative  end  of
another  HCl  molecule.  Dipole-dipole  attractions  are  especially  important  in
polar  liquids.  These  dipole-dipole  attractions  tend  to  be    rather  strong  inter-
molecular forces, although not nearly as strong as ion-dipole attractions.
Hydrogen Bonding Intermolecular Forces
Hydrogen bonding is really a subtype of dipole-dipole attraction. In this case, a
hydrogen atom bonds to a very electronegative element. The only elements suf-
ﬁciently electronegative are: N, O, or F. The resultant bond to hydrogen is more
polar than the electronegativity difference would predict. This extreme polarity
leads  to  a  greater  than  expected  degree  of  charge  separation.  Therefore,  the
attraction of the hydrogen of one molecule and the N, O, or F of another mol-
ecule is unusually strong. Hydrogen bonds tend to be stronger than the typical
dipole-dipole interaction.

Hydrogen bonding explains why water has such unusual properties. We will dis-
cuss these properties later in this chapter.

Don’t Forget!

Hydrogen bonding can only occur when a hydrogen atom is bonded directly to
an N, O, or F.

Ion-Induced Dipole and Dipole-Induced Dipole
Intermolecular Forces
These types of attractions occur when the charge on an ion or a dipole distorts
the electron cloud of a nonpolar molecule. This induces a temporary dipole in
the nonpolar molecule. These are fairly weak interactions. Like an ion-dipole
force, this type of force requires the presence of two different substances.
London (Dispersion) Intermolecular Forces
This intermolecular attraction occurs in all substances. It is usually only signiﬁ-
cant  for  nonpolar  substances.  It  arises  from  the  momentary  distortion  of  the
electron  cloud.  This  distortion  causes  a  very  weak  temporary  dipole,  which

Intermolecular Forces, Solids and Liquids

161

induces a dipole in another molecule. These weak dipoles lead to an attraction.
Although this is an extremely weak interaction, it is strong enough to allow us
to liquefy nonpolar gases such as hydrogen, H2. If there were no intermolecu-
lar forces attracting these molecules, it would be impossible to liquefy hydro-
gen. The more electrons present, the greater the London force.

11-2 Properties of Liquids

At the microscopic level, the liquid particles are in constant motion. The particles
may exhibit short-range areas of order, but these usually do not last very long.
Clumps of particles may form and then break apart. At the macroscopic level, a
liquid  has  a  speciﬁc  volume  but  no  ﬁxed  shape.  Three  additional  macroscopic
properties deserve discussion: surface tension, viscosity, and capillary action. 

In  the  body  of  a  liquid,  intermolecular  forces  pull  the  molecules  in  all  direc-
tions. At the surface of the liquid, the molecules pull down into the body of the
liquid and from the sides. There are no molecules above the surface to pull in
that  direction.  The  effect  of  this  unequal  attraction  is  that  the  liquid  tries  to
minimize  its  surface  area.  The  minimum  surface  area  for  a  given  quantity  of
matter is a sphere. In a large pool of liquid, where sphere formation is not pos-
sible,  the  surface  behaves  as  if  it  had  a  thin  stretched  elastic  membrane  or
“skin” over it. The surface tension is the resistance of a liquid to an increase in
its surface area. It requires force to break the attractive forces at the surface.
The greater the intermolecular force, the greater the surface tension. Polar liq-
uids, especially those that utilize hydrogen bonding, have a much higher surface
tension than nonpolar liquids.

Viscosity is the resistance to ﬂow. Important factors inﬂuencing the viscosity of
a  liquid  are  the  intermolecular  forces  and  the  temperature.  The  stronger  the
intermolecular  force,  the  greater  the  viscosity.  As  the  temperature  increases,
the kinetic energy of the particles increases. The higher kinetic energy will over-
come the intermolecular attractive forces. This causes a lower viscosity. In some
cases, another factor is the size of the molecule. Large and complex molecules
will  have  difﬁculty  moving  past  one  another.  If  they  cannot  easily  move  past
each other, the viscosity will be high.

Capillary  action is  the  spontaneous  rising  of  a  liquid  through  a  narrow  tube
against  the  force  of  gravity.  It  is  due  to  competition  of  intermolecular  forces
within the liquid and attractive forces between the liquid and the tube wall. The
stronger  the  attraction  between  the  liquid  and  the  wall,  the  higher  the  level
rises. Liquids that have weak attractions to the walls, like mercury in a glass
tube, have low capillary action. Liquids like water in a glass tube have strong
attractions to the walls and will have high capillary action. This also explains

162

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

why we observe a meniscus with water contained in a thin tube. A meniscus is
a concave water surface due to the attraction of the water molecules adjacent
to  the  glass  walls.  No  meniscus  is  present  with  mercury  because  of  its  weak
attraction to the walls.

As we have noted before, water, because of hydrogen bonding has some very
unusual properties. It will dissolve a great number of substances, both ionic and
polar  covalent.  This  is  because  of  its  polarity  and  ability  to  form  hydrogen
bonds. It has a high heat capacity (see Chapter 6). This is the heat absorbed to
cause a speciﬁc increase in temperature. Water has a high heat of vaporization.
This is the heat necessary to transform a liquid into a gas. Both of these ther-
mal properties are a result of the strong hydrogen bonding between the mole-
cules. Water has a high surface tension for the same reason. Finally, the fact that
the solid form of water (ice) is less dense than liquid water is because of hydro-
gen  bonds.  These  forces  hold  the  water  molecules  in  a  rigid  open  crystalline
framework. As ice starts to melt, the crystal structure breaks, and water mole-
cules ﬁll the holes in the structure. Filling the holes increases the density. The
density  reaches  a  maximum  at  around  4°C  and  then  the  increasing  kinetic
energy of the particles causes the density to decrease.

11-3 Solids

At the macroscopic level, a solid is a substance that has both a deﬁnite volume
and a deﬁnite shape. At the microscopic level, solids may be one of two types:
amorphous or crystalline. Amorphous solids lack extensive ordering of the par-
ticles. There is a lack of regularity of the structure. There may be small regions
of order separated by large areas of disordered particles. They resemble liquids
more than solids in this characteristic. Amorphous solids have no distinct melt-
ing point. They simply become softer and softer as the temperature rises. Glass,
rubber, and charcoal are examples of amorphous solids.

Crystalline  solids display  a  very  regular  ordering  of  the  particles  in  a  three-
dimensional structure called the crystal lattice. In this crystal lattice there are
repeating units called unit cells. See your textbook for diagrams of unit cells.

Don’t Forget!

In looking at crystal lattice diagrams, count all the particles in all three dimen-
sions that surround another particle.

Intermolecular Forces, Solids and Liquids

163

Don’t Forget!

Particles not in the center of a cell are shared by more then one cell. The con-
tribution from these particles will be only a fraction of the complete particle.

There are ﬁve types of crystalline solids:
1. Atomic solids have individual atoms held in place by London forces. The

noble gases are the only atomic solids known.

2. Molecular solids have their lattices composed of molecules held in place by
London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and hydrogen bonding. Solid methane
and water are example of molecular solids.

3. Ionic solids have their lattices composed of ions held together by the attrac-
tion  of  opposite  charges  of  the  ions.  These  crystalline  solids  tend  to  be
strong with high melting points due to the strength of the intermolecular
forces. NaCl and other salts are example of ionic solids. 

4. Metallic solids have metal atoms occupying the crystal lattice held together
by  metallic  bonding.  In  metallic  bonding, the  electrons  of  the  atoms  are
delocalized and free to move throughout the entire solid. This explains the
electrical and thermal conductivity as well as many of the other properties
of metals.

5. Network covalent solids have covalent bonds joining the atoms together in
the crystal lattice, which is quite large. Graphite, diamond, and silicon diox-
ide (SiO2) are examples of network solids.

11-4 Phase Changes

An equilibrium exists between a liquid and its vapor. This is just one of several
equilibria that exist between the states of matter. A phase diagram is a graph
representing the relationship of all the states of matter of a substance. One type
of  phase  diagram  relates  the  states  to  temperature  and  pressure.  This  type
allows us to predict which state of matter will exist at a certain temperature and
pressure combination. Figure 11-1 shows a general form of a phase diagram.

Note that the diagram has three general areas corresponding to the three states
of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. The line from A to C represents the change in
vapor pressure of the solid with temperature for the sublimation (going directly
from a solid to a gas without ﬁrst becoming a liquid) equilibrium. The A to

164

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Figure 11-1 A phase diagram

D line represents the variation in the melting point with pressure. The A to B
line represents the variation of the vapor pressure of a liquid with pressure. This
B point shown on this phase diagram is the critical point of the substance, the
point beyond which the gas and liquid phases are indistinguishable from each
other. At or beyond this critical point, no matter how much pressure is applied,
it is not possible to condense the gas into a liquid. Point A is the triple point of
the substance, the combination of temperature and pressure at which all three
states of matter can exist. 

Quick Tip

In looking at phase diagrams, be careful when moving from point to point to pay
attention to any phase changes which might occur.

Intermolecular Forces, Solids and Liquids

165

Intermolecular  forces  can  affect  phase  changes.  Strong  intermolecular  forces
require more kinetic energy to convert a liquid into a gas. Stronger intermole-
cular forces, make it easier to condense a gas into a liquid. 

11-5 Utterly Confused About

Intermolecular Forces

Let’s begin by analyzing a typical problem. What is the strongest type of inter-
molecular force present in each of the following: methane, CH4, methyl alcohol,
CH3OH,  diamond,  C,  methyl  ﬂuoride,  CH3F,  iron,  Fe,  ammonium  ﬂuoride,
NH4F, krypton diﬂuoride, KrF2, and sodium chloride, NaCl? You may or may
not  encounter  a  question  with  eight  substances,  such  as  this  question,  but
regardless of the number of substances, the procedure will be the same.

For  each  of  the  substances  the  possible  answers  are  ionic  bonding,  covalent
bonding, metallic bonding, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole force, or London
force. Forces, such as ion-dipole forces and ion-induced dipole forces, are not
choices  because  these  require  the  presence  of  two  or  more  substances.  For
example, sodium chloride cannot utilize either of these two forces, but sodium
chloride in water can. (Sodium chloride in water exhibits ion-dipole forces.)

Each of the eight substances will exhibit London forces since they are present
in everything containing electrons. London forces are only the strongest type of
intermolecular  force  if  there  are  no  other  attractions  present.  The  most  con-
venient method of analyzing this problem is to leave consideration of London
forces to the last.

We can begin with any of the intermolecular forces other than London forces.
It  is  usually  easiest  to  begin  with  the  “normal”  bonds  (covalent,  ionic,  and
metallic).  Bonds  only  occur  in  speciﬁc  circumstances.  For  example,  metallic
bonds only occur in metals or metal alloys. The only metal or alloy in the seven
substance list is iron. For this reason, the strongest intermolecular force in iron
is metallic bonding.

Very  few  materials  utilize  covalent  bonding  as  an  important  intermolecular
force. The best-known examples are silicon dioxide, SiO2, graphite, C, and dia-
mond, C. One of these three common examples, diamond, is in our question.
Therefore, the strongest intermolecular force in diamond is covalent bonding.

Ionic bonding is present in compounds containing a metal and a nonmetal or in
a compound containing one or more polyatomic ions. There are a few excep-
tions  to  this  generalization,  but  these  usually  do  not  appear  in  this  type  of
question. An ionic substance must contain at least two different elements, so we

166

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

know that iron and diamond cannot involve ionic bonding. This is a check on
the  validity  of  our  earlier  predictions.  Several  of  the  remaining  substances,
methane, methyl alcohol, methyl ﬂuoride, and krypton diﬂuoride, do not con-
tain a metal or a polyatomic ion. (Be careful with methyl alcohol. This com-
pound does not contain the hydroxide ion. The –OH group in this compound is
an alcohol group.) Only two substances remain: ammonium ﬂuoride and sodi-
um chloride. Ammonium ﬂuoride does not contain a metal, but it does contain
a  polyatomic  ion,  the  ammonium  ion.  The  presence  of  the  polyatomic  ion
means  that  the  strongest  intermolecular  force  will  be  ionic  bonding.  Sodium
chloride  consists  of  a  metal  and  a  nonmetal,  which  means  that  its  strongest
intermolecular force is ionic bonding.

The next strongest type of intermolecular force is hydrogen bonding. This type
of force requires a hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen, oxygen, or ﬂuorine. We
can  eliminate  any  compound  not  containing  hydrogen  (KrF2)  and  any  com-
pound not containing nitrogen, oxygen, or ﬂuorine (CH4). This leaves us with
methyl alcohol, CH3OH, and methyl ﬂuoride, CH3F. (You may need to sketch
the  atom  arrangement  for  these  two  compounds  to  make  the  prediction.)  In
methyl  alcohol,  there  is  a  bond  between  one  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  and  the
oxygen atom. This attachment allows the formation of hydrogen bonds. In this
compound, the remaining hydrogen atoms bond to the carbon. In methyl ﬂuo-
ride,  the  hydrogen  atoms  bond  to  the  carbon.  Since  no  hydrogen  atoms  are
bonded to the ﬂuorine, hydrogen bonding is not possible.

We  now  have  three  substances  remaining:  methane,  CH4,  methyl  ﬂuoride,
CH3F, and krypton diﬂuoride, KrF2. We also have two types of intermolecular
force  remaining:  dipole-dipole  forces  and  London  forces.  In  order  to  match
these substances and forces we must know which of the substances are polar
and  which  are  nonpolar.  Polar  substances  utilize  dipole-dipole  forces,  while
nonpolar substances utilize London forces. To determine the polarity of each
substance, we must draw a Lewis structure for the substance (Chapter 9) and
use  valence-shell  electron  pair  repulsion  (VSEPR)  (Chapter  10).  The  Lewis
structures for these substances are:

The molecular geometry of methane and of methyl ﬂuoride is tetrahedral. In
the  case  of  methane,  this  symmetrical  arrangement  of  polar  covalent  carbon-
hydrogen bonds leads to a canceling of the bond polarities resulting in a nonpolar
molecule. As a nonpolar molecule, the strongest intermolecular force in methane
is a London force. In methyl ﬂuoride, a ﬂuorine atom replaces one of the hydrogen

Intermolecular Forces, Solids and Liquids

167

atoms in methane. The polarity of the polar covalent carbon-ﬂuorine bond is not
equal to that of a carbon-hydrogen bond. This difference in polarity means that
the bond polarities will no longer cancel. If the bond polarities do not cancel, the
molecule is polar. Methyl ﬂuoride is a polar molecule. The strongest intermolec-
ular force in the polar methyl ﬂuoride is a dipole-dipole force.

The krypton atom in krypton diﬂuoride does not obey the octet rule. The presence
of  ﬁve  pair  around  the  krypton  leads  to  a  trigonal  bipyramidal  electron-group
geometry. The presence of three lone pairs and two bonding pairs around the kryp-
ton makes the molecule linear. The two krypton-ﬂuorine bonds are polar covalent.
However, in a linear molecule, the bond polarities pull directly against each other
and cancel. Cancelled bond polarities make the molecule nonpolar. The strongest
intermolecular force in the nonpolar krypton diﬂuoride is London force.

The answers are:

Methane, CH4,
Methyl alcohol, CH3OH,
Diamond, C,
Methyl ﬂuoride, CH3F,
Iron, Fe,
Ammonium ﬂuoride, NH4F,
Krypton diﬂuoride, KrF2,

In  this  chapter,  you  have  learned  about  intermolecular  forces,  the  forces
between  atoms,  molecules,  and/or  ions.  The  types  of  intermolecular  forces
include ion-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, ion-induced and dipole-induced
forces, and London (dispersion) forces.

Liquids possess certain properties due to the intermolecular forces between the
liquid particles. These properties include surface tension, viscosity, and capil-
lary action. Solids may be either amorphous or crystalline in nature. 

A  phase  diagram  may  represent  changes  of  state  in  a  substance.  The  critical
point is the point beyond which the gas and liquid states are indistinguishable
while the triple point is the point of a phase diagram in which the solid, liquid
and gas may all exist.

Get Started

The major goal of this chapter is to help you master the concepts associated with
solutions—concentration units, solubility, and especially colligative properties.
We will also examine the properties of colloids. If you are still unsure about cal-
culations and the mole concept, review Chapters 1, 3, and 4. And again, the only
way to master these concepts is to Practice, Practice, Practice.

12-1 Concentration Units 

A solution is  a  homogeneous  mixture  composed  of  solvent  and  one  or  more
solutes. The solvent is normally the substance present in the greatest amount. The
solute is the substance that is present in the smaller amount. If water is the sol-
vent, it is an aqueous solution. You may have more than one solute in a solution.

Some substances will dissolve in a particular solvent and others will not. There
is a general rule in chemistry that states “like dissolves like.” Polar substances
(such as alcohols) will dissolve in polar solvents like water. Nonpolar solutes
(such as iodine) will dissolve in nonpolar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride.
The mass of solute per 100 mL of solvent (g/100 mL) is a common alternative
to expressing the solubility as molarity. It is necessary to specify the tempera-
ture because the solubility of a substance will vary with the temperature. The
solubility  of  a  solid  dissolving  in  a  liquid  normally  increases  with  increasing
temperature. The reverse is true for a gas dissolving in a liquid.

A solution containing the maximum amount of solute per given amount of sol-
vent at a given temperature is a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution has
less than that maximum amount of solute dissolved. Sometimes, there may be
more that that maximum amount of solute, resulting in a supersaturated solu-
tion.  Supersaturated  solutions  are  unstable  and  eventually  expel  the  excess
solute, forming a saturated solution.

There are many ways of expressing the relative amounts of solute(s) and sol-
vent in a particular solution. The terms saturated, unsaturated, and supersatu-
rated discussed above give a qualitative measure of solubility, as do the terms
dilute and concentrated. Dilute refers to a solution that has a relatively small
amount of solute in comparison to the amount of solvent. Concentrated refers
to a solution that has a relatively large amount of solute in comparison to the
solvent. These terms are very subjective and chemists prefer to use quantitative

Solutions

173

ways of expressing the concentration of solutions. There are a number of these
concentration  units  that  prove  to  be  useful,  including  percentage,  molarity,
molality, and mole fraction.

Percentage
One  common  way  of  expressing  the  relative  amount  of  solute  and  solvent  is
through percentage, amount per hundred. There are three ways that we may
express this percentage: mass percent, mass/volume percent, and volume/volume
percent.

Mass (weight) Percentage
The mass percentage of a solution is the mass of the solute divided by the mass

Don’t Forget!

Add both the solute and solvent masses together to give the solution mass.

Mass/volume Percentage
The mass/volume percent of a solution is the mass of the solute (typically in
grams) divided by the volume (typically in mL) of the solution and then multi-
plied by 100% to yield percentage.

If the volumes of both the solute and solvent are given, don’t forget to add both
volumes together to give the volume of the solution.

Volume/volume Percentage
The third case is one in which both the solute and solvent are liquids. The vol-
ume percent of the solution is the volume of the solute divided by total volume
of the solution and then again multiplied by 100% to generate the percentage.

Determine the volume percentage of carbon tetrachloride in a solution prepared
by dissolving 100.0 mL of carbon tetrachloride and 100.0 mL of methylene chlo-

Volume% ⫽

(100.0 mL carbon tetrachloride)

(100.0 ⫹ 100.0 ⫹ 750.0) mL solution

⫻ 100% ⫽ 10.53%

Molarity
While  percentage  concentration  is  common  in  everyday  life,  most  chemists
(and chemistry students) use molarity. Molarity (M) is the number of moles of
solute per liter of solution:

M ⫽ moles solute/liter solution

Refer back to Chapter 4 for problems related to molarity.

Solutions

Don’t Forget!

175

In preparing a molar solution, the correct number of moles of solute (commonly
converted  to  grams  using  the  molar  mass)  is  dissolved  and  diluted  to  the
required volume.

Molality
Molality (m) is the moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

m = moles solute/kg solvent

Notice that it is kilograms of solvent, not solution. In the other concentration
units, it has been the mass or volume of the solution. In molal solutions, it is the
mass of the solvent.

Ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) is in antifreeze. Determine the molality of ethylene gly-
col in a solution prepared by adding 31.0 g of ethylene glycol to 200.0 g of water.

b ⫽ 2.50 m C2H6O2

Don’t Forget!

It is the kilograms of the solvent in the denominator and not the solution.

Mole Fraction
The  mole  fraction,  X,  is  the  moles  of  solute  divided  by  the  total  number  of
moles of solution.

X ⫽ moles solute/total moles of solution

Suppose you have a solution containing 0.50 mol of sodium chloride in 2.0 mol
of water. The mole fraction of sodium chloride would be:

XNaCl ⫽ moles NaCl/(moles NaCl ⫹ moles H2O) ⫽ 0.50/(0.50 ⫹ 2.00) ⫽ 0.20

Quick Tip

The sum of all the mole fractions of the components of a solution should equal 1.00. 

Dilution
Another way to prepare a solution is by diluting a more concentrated solution
to a more dilute one by adding solvent. You can use the following equation:

(Cbefore dilution) (Vbefore dilution) ⫽ (Cafter dilution) (Vafter dilution)

In this equation, C represents any concentration unit and V is any volume unit,
as long as the same concentration and volume unit are used on both sides.

Determine the ﬁnal concentration when 800.0 mL of water is added to 300.0 mL
of a 0.1000 M solution of HCl. Assume the volumes are additive.

12-2 Temperature and Pressure Effects

on Solubility 

The solubility of most solids increases with increasing temperature. However,
the  solubility  of  gases  in  liquids  decreases  with  increasing  temperature.  For
example, if you open a cold bottle of soda and a warm bottle of soda, more gas
is released by the warm soda. This is the basis of thermal pollution, in which the
solubility of oxygen in stream or lake water is decreased if the water is polluted
by heat.

The solubility of liquids and solids are, in general, not affected by changes in
pressure. However, the solubility of gases is affected. The greater the pressure
is, the greater the solubility of the gas in a liquid.

12-3 Colligative Properties 

Some of the properties of solutions are dependent upon the chemical and phys-
ical nature of the individual solute. However, there are solution properties that
depend  only  on  the  number of  solute  particles  and  not  their  identity.  These
properties are colligative properties and they include:
• Vapor pressure lowering 
• Freezing point depression
• Boiling point elevation
• Osmotic pressure
Vapor Pressure Lowering
If a liquid is placed into a sealed container, molecules will evaporate from the sur-
face of the liquid and will eventually establish a gas phase over the liquid that is
in equilibrium with the liquid phase. This is the vapor pressure of the liquid. This
vapor pressure is temperature dependent, the higher the temperature the higher
the vapor pressure. If a solution is prepared, then the solvent contribution to the
vapor pressure of the solution depends upon the vapor pressure of the pure sol-
vent, P°solvent, and the mole fraction of the solvent. We can ﬁnd the contribution
of solvent to the vapor pressure of the solution by the following relationship:

Psolvent ⫽ Xsolvent P°solvent

A similar calculation gives the solute contribution.

Psolute ⫽ Xsolute P°solute

There may be more than one solute present. If there is more than one solute,
we ﬁnd the contribution of each solute in the same way. If the solute is non-
volatile, P°solute ⫽ 0.

The vapor pressure of a solution is the sum of the contributions of all solutes
and the solvent.

Psolution ⫽ Psolvent ⫹ Psolute or Psolution ⫽ Xsolvent P°solvent ⫹ Xsolute P°solute

This relationship is Raoult’s law.

Not all solutions obey Raoult’s law. Any solution that follows Raoult’s law is an
ideal solution. However, many solutions are not ideal solutions. A solution may
have a vapor pressure higher than predicted by Raoult’s law. A solution may
have a vapor pressure lower than predicted by Raoult’s law. Solutions with a

178

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

lower  than  expected  vapor  pressure,  are  showing  a  negative  deviation  from
Raoult’s law, while those with a higher than expected vapor pressure are show-
ing a positive deviation from Raoult’s law. 

In general, ideal solutions result when the intermolecular forces between the
particles are similar to those in the solvent or solute alone. When the intermol-
ecular  forces  in  the  solution  are  weaker,  the  molecules  tend  to  escape  more
readily  and  produce  a  positive  deviation.  If  the  intermolecular  forces  in  the
solution are greater than those in the individual constituents then the particles
stay together instead of vaporizing. These solutions show a negative deviation.

If a pure liquid is the solvent and you add a nonvolatile solute, the vapor pres-
sure of the resulting solution is always less than the pure liquid. The addition of
the solute lowers the vapor pressure and the amount of lowering is proportional
to the number of solute particles added.

There is an even distribution of solvent particles throughout the solution, even at
the  surface.  There  are  fewer  solvent  particles  at  the  gas-liquid  interface.
Evaporation takes place at this interface. Fewer solvent particles escape into the
gas phase and thus the vapor pressure is lower. The higher the concentration of
solute particles, the less solvent is at the interface and the lower the vapor pressure.
Freezing-point Depression and Boiling-Point Elevation 
The freezing point of a solution of a nonvolatile solute is always lower than the
pure solvent and the boiling point is always higher. It is the number of solute
particles that determines the amount of the lowering of the freezing point and
raising of the boiling point.

The amount of lowering of the freezing point is proportional to the molality of
the solute and is given by the equation:

⌬Tf ⫽ iKf m

⌬Tf is the number of degrees that the freezing point has been lowered (the dif-
ference  in  the  freezing  point  of  the  pure  solvent  and  the  solution).  Kf is  the
freezing-point depression constant (a constant of the individual solvent). The
molality (m) is the molality of the solute, and i is the van’t Hoff factor, which is
the ratio of the number of moles of particles released into solution per mole of
solute  dissolved.  For  a  nonelectrolyte  such  as  sucrose,  the  van’t  Hoff  factor
would be 1. For an electrolyte such as sodium sulfate, you must take into con-
sideration that if 1 mol of Na2SO4 dissolves, 3 mol of particles would result
2⫺). Therefore, the van’t Hoff factor should be 3. However,
(2 mol Na⫹, 1 mol SO4
because sometimes there is a pairing of ions in solution the observed van’t Hoff
factor is slightly less. The more dilute the solution, the closer the observed van’t
Hoff factor should be to the expected one.

Solutions

179

Just as the freezing point of a solution is always lower than the pure solvent, the
boiling point of a solution is always higher than the solvent. The relationship is
similar to the one for the freezing point depression above and is:

⌬Tb ⫽ iKbm

In this equation, ⌬Tb is the number of degrees that the boiling point has been
elevated (the difference between the boiling point of the pure solvent and the
solution), Kb is  the  boiling-point  elevation  constant,  m is  the  molality  of  the
solute, and i is again the van’t Hoff factor.
Osmotic Pressure
A U-tube contains a solution and pure solvent. A semipermeable membrane sep-
arates the two components. Such a membrane allows the passage of solvent mol-
ecules but not solute particles. This arrangement will result in the level of the solvent
side decreasing while the solution side increasing. This indicates that the solvent
molecules  are  passing  through  the  semipermeable  membrane.  This  process  is
osmosis. Eventually the system would reach equilibrium and the difference in levels
would remain constant. The difference in the two levels is related to the osmotic
pressure. In fact, one could exert a pressure on the solution side exceeding the
osmotic pressure. This will cause the solvent molecules to move back through the
semipermeable membrane into the solvent side. This process is reverse osmosis
and is the basis of desalination of seawater for drinking purposes.

The osmotic pressure is a colligative property and mathematically represented as:

␲ ⫽ (nRT/V) i ⫽ iMRT

In this equation, ␲ is the osmotic pressure in atmospheres, n is the number of
moles  of  solute,  R is  the  ideal  gas  constant  (0.0821  L.atm/K⭈mol), T is  the
Kelvin temperature, V is the volume of the solution and i is the van’t Hoff fac-
tor.  If  one  knows  the  moles  of  solute  and  the  volume  in  liters,  n/V  may  be
replaced by the molarity, M. It is possible to calculate the molar mass of a solute
from osmotic pressure measurements. This is especially useful in the determi-
nation of the molar mass of large molecules such as proteins.

12-4 Colloids

Particles will settle out of water from a muddy stream. This water is a hetero-
geneous mixture, where the particles are large (in excess of 103 nm in diameter)
and is a suspension. On the other hand, dissolving sodium chloride in water pro-
duces a true homogeneous solution, where the solute particles are less than
1 nm in diameter. Particles do not settle out of a true solution because of their
very  small  particle  size.  However,  there  is  a  mixture  with  particle  diameters

180

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

falling between solutions and suspensions. These are colloids and have particles
in  the  1  to  103 nm  diameter  range.  Smoke,  fog,  milk,  mayonnaise,  and  latex
paint are all examples of colloids.

Many times, it is difﬁcult to distinguish a colloid from a true solution. The most
common way is by shining a light through the mixture. A light shone through a
true solution is invisible, but a light shown through a colloid is visible due to the
reﬂection of the light off the larger colloid particles. This is the Tyndall effect.

12-5 Utterly Confused About

Colligative Properties

Let’s  examine  a  few  examples  of  how  to  approach  colligative  property  prob-
lems. We will begin with a Raoult’s law example.

What is the vapor pressure of a solution made by mixing 80.0 g of chloroform,
CHCl3, in 800.0 g of carbon tetrachloride, CCl4? The vapor pressure of chloro-
form is 197 torr, and the vapor pressure of carbon tetrachloride is 114 torr (all
vapor pressures are determined at 25°C).

Raoult’s law requires the mole fraction of each volatile material. Whenever the
mole fraction is not present, we will need to calculate the value from the num-
ber of moles. In this example, we must begin by calculating the moles of each
constituent of the solution.

Moles chloroform ⫽ (80.0 g CHCl3) (1 mol CHCl3/119.378 g CHCl3)

⫽ 0.6701402 mol CHCl3 (unrounded)

Moles carbon tetrachloride ⫽ (800.0 g CCl4) (1 mol CCl4/153.823 g CCl4)

⫽ 5.2007827 mol CCl4 (unrounded)

The mole fraction of chloroform (solute) is:

Xsolute

⫽

(0.6701402) mol CHCl3

(0.6701402 ⫹ 5.2007827) mol

⫽ 0.1141456 (unrounded)

It is possible to calculate the mole fraction of carbon tetrachloride (solvent) in
a similar manner. However, simply subtracting the mole fraction of chloroform
from 1 will give the same value.

Xsolvent ⫽ 1 ⫺ 0.1141456 ⫽ 0.8858544 (unrounded)

Solutions

Using Raoult’s law:

Psolution ⫽ Xsolvent P°solvent ⫹ Xsolute P°solute

Psolution ⫽ (0.8858544) (114 torr) ⫹ (0.1141456) (197 torr)

⫽ 123.47408 ⫽ 123 torr

In our next example, we will show an example of freezing point depression and
boiling point elevation. This will require us to use the equation ∆Tf ⫽ iKfm. In
this example, we will use a nonelectrolyte, so we will not need the van’t Hoff
factor (or simply i ⫽ 1).

Determine both the freezing point and boiling point of a solution containing 15.50 g
of  naphthalene,  C10H8,  in  0.200  kg  of  benzene,  C6H6. Pure  benzene  freezes  at
278.65 K and boils at 353.25 K. Kf for benzene is 5.07 K/m and its Kb is 2.64 K/m.
We will begin by calculating the change in the freezing point, ∆Tf, to answer this
problem. The problem gives us the value of Kf, and we are assuming that i = 1.
Therefore, we need to know the molality of the solution to ﬁnd our answer. To
determine the molality, we will begin by determining the moles of naphthalene.
Naphthalene has a molar mass of 128.17 g/mol. Thus, the number of moles of
naphthalene present is:

15.50 g

128.17 g/mol

⫽  0.120933 mol (unrounded)

The molality of the solution, based on the deﬁnition of molality, would be:

0.120933 mol

0.200 kg

⫽ 0.604665 m (unrounded)

We can enter the given values along with the calculated molality into the freez-
ing point depression equation:

⌬T ⫽ iKfm ⫽ (1) (5.07 K/m) (0.604665 m) ⫽ 3.06565 K ⫽ 3.07 K 

Tf ⫽ (278.65 ⫺ 3.07) K ⫽ 275.58 K (2.43⬚C)

Don’t Forget!

You must subtract the ⌬T value from the normal freezing point to get the freez-
ing point of the solution.

182

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

To calculate the boiling point of the solution we use the relationship:

⌬Tb ⫽ iKbm

We already have the van’t Hoff factor, the Kb, and solution molality so we can
simply substitute:

⌬Tb ⫽ iKbm ⫽ (1) (2.64 K/m) (0.604665 m) ⫽ 1.59632 K (unrounded)
Tb ⫽ (353.25 ⫹ 1.59632) K ⫽ 354.85 K (81.70°C)

The freezing point depression and boiling point elevation techniques are useful
in calculating the molar mass of a solute or its van’t Hoff factor. In these cases,
you  will  begin  with  the  answer  (the  freezing  point  depression  or  the  boiling
point elevation), and follow the same steps as above in reverse order.

In the next example, we will examine the colligative property of osmotic pres-
sure. This will require us to use the relationship p ⫽ i(nRT/V).

A solution prepared by dissolving 7.95 mg of a gene fragment in 25.0 mL of water
has an osmotic pressure of 0.295 torr at 25.0°C. Assuming the fragment is a non-
electrolyte; determine the molar mass of the gene fragment.

In this example, we need to determine the molar mass (g/mol) of the gene frag-
ment. This requires two pieces of information—the mass of the substance and
the number of moles. We know the mass (7.95 mg), thus we need to determine
the number of moles present. We will rearrange the osmotic pressure relation-
ship to n ⫽ ␲ V/RT. We know the solute is a nonelectrolyte so i ⫽ 1. We can
now enter the given values into the rearranged equation and perform a pressure
and a volume conversion:

found to give the molar mass. This will require the conversion of the milligrams
given into grams.

Quick Tip

183

A  molar  mass  (molecular  weight)  less  than  1.0  g/mol  indicates  an  error.  No
molecular weight is less than the atomic weight of hydrogen.

In the preceding examples, we saw how to deal with nonelectrolytes. If the solu-
tion  contains  an  electrolyte,  there  will  only  be  one  change  necessary.  This
change will be to enter the value of the van’t Hoff factor. We will see how to do
this in the next example.

Determine  both  the  freezing  point  and  boiling  point  of  a  solution  containing
15.50  g  of  sodium  sulfate,  Na2SO4,  in  0.200  kg  of  water.  Pure  water  freezes  at
0.00°C and boils at 100.00°C. Kf for water is 1.86°C/m and its Kb is 0.52°C/m.

We  will  follow  the  same  procedure  as  in  the  naphthalene/benzene  example
above.  You  may  wish  to  look  over  these  examples  in  parallel  to  see  exactly
where the difference between an electrolyte and nonelectrolyte manifests itself.
We will again begin by calculating the freezing point, ∆Tf. The problem gives us
the value of Kf. In solution, the strong electrolyte, sodium sulfate, ionizes as:

Na2SO4(aq) l 2 Na⫹(aq) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq)

From this relationship, we can see that each Na2SO4 produces three ions. The
production of three ions means that the van’t Hoff factor, i, is 3. We need to
know the molality of the solution to ﬁnd our answer. To determine the molality,
we will begin by determining the moles of sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate has
a  molar  mass  of  142.04  g/mol.  Thus,  the  number  of  moles  of  sodium  sulfate
present is:

⫽ 0.10912419 mol (unrounded)

Don’t Forget!

The most common error made in colligative property problems is to forget to sep-
arate the ions of an electrolyte. The van’t Hoff factor, even when not needed, is
a useful reminder.

In this chapter, you learned about solutions. A solution is a homogeneous mix-
ture composed of a solvent and one or more solutes. Solutions may be unsatu-
rated,  saturated,  or  supersaturated.  Solution  concentration  units  include  per-
centage, molarity, molality, and mole fraction. The solubility of solids in liquids
normally increases with increasing temperature, but the reverse is true of gases
dissolving in liquids. The solubility of gases in liquids increases with increasing
pressure.

Colligative properties are those properties of solutions that depend on the num-
ber  of  solute  particles  present  and  not  their  identity.  Colligative  properties
include vapor pressure lowering, freezing point depression, boiling point eleva-
tion, and osmotic pressure. Colloids are homogeneous mixtures, in which the
solute particles are intermediate in size between suspensions and true solutions.
We can distinguish colloids from true solutions by the Tyndall effect.

affect the speed of reactions. We will be discussing the concept of half-lives; you
will see this concept again in Chapter 20 on Nuclear Chemistry. It will be nec-
essary in some of the problems to solve for an exponential quantity along with
the use of the lnand the exfunctions, so you might want to refresh yourself with
your calculator manual. And don’t forget!—Practice, Practice, Practice.

13-1 Reaction Rates 

Many  times,  we  can  use  thermodynamics  to  predict  whether  a  reaction  will
occur  spontaneously,  but  it  gives  very  little  information  about  the  speed  at
which  a  reaction  occurs.  Kinetics is  the  study  of  the  speed  of  reactions.  It  is
largely an experimental science. Some general qualitative ideas about reaction
speed may be applied, but accurate quantitative relationships require that we
collect experimental data.

In order for a chemical reaction to occur, there must be a collision between the
reactants at the correct place on the molecule, the reactive site. That collision is
necessary to transfer kinetic energy in order to break old chemical bonds and
reform new ones. If the collision doesn’t transfer enough energy, no reaction
will occur.

In general, ﬁve factors can affect the rates of chemical reaction: 

1. Nature of the reactants—Large, slow-moving complex molecules will tend
to react slower than smaller ones because there is a greater chance of colli-
sions occurring somewhere else on the molecule rather than the reactive
site. Also, if the molecules are slow moving, the number of collisions will be
smaller. 

2. The temperature—Increasing the temperature normally increases the reac-
tion rate since each species has a higher kinetic energy and the number of
collisions is increased. This increases the chance that enough energy will be
transferred during collisions to cause the reaction.

3. The concentration of reactants—Increasing the concentration of the reac-
tants  (or  pressure,  if  gases  are  involved)  normally  increases  the  reaction
rate due to the increased number of collisions.

Kinetics

189

4. Physical  state  of  reactants—Gases  and  liquids  tend  to  react  faster  than
solids because of the increase in surface area of the gases and liquids ver-
sus the solid.

5. Catalysts—Using a catalyst increases the reaction rate.

The rate of reaction is the change in concentration per change in time. It is pos-
sible to ﬁnd the rate of reaction from a graph of concentration of a reactant ver-
sus time. The procedure involves drawing a tangent to the curve at the point in
the reaction where we wish to know the rate.

M

∆M

∆t

Time

The slope of the tangent (∆M/∆t) is the instantaneous rate of the reaction at this
time. To determine the rate at a different time, we would need to draw another tan-
gent line. In most kinetic studies, we wish to know the initial rate. The initial rate
comes from a tangent drawn to the curve at the very beginning of the reaction.

13-2 Rate Laws 

Let’s consider those cases in which the reactant concentration may affect the
speed of reaction. For the general reaction:

a A ⫹ b B ⫹ . . . . l c C ⫹ d D ⫹ . . . 

Where the lower case letters are the coefﬁcients in the balanced chemical equa-
tion, the upper case letters stand for the reactant, and product chemical species
and initial rates are used, then the rate equation (rate law) is:

Rate ⫽ k[A]m[B]n . . . .

In this expression, k is the rate constant (for the chemical reaction at a given
temperature). The exponents, m and n, are the orders of reaction. The orders
indicate what effect a change in concentration of that particular reactant species
will have on the reaction rate. If, for example, m ⫽ 1 and n ⫽ 2, then if the

190

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

concentration of reactant A is doubled, the rate will also double ([2]1 ⫽ 2) and
if  the  concentration  of  reactant  B  is  doubled,  the  rate  will  increase  fourfold
([2]2 ⫽ 4). This reaction is ﬁrst order with respect to reactant A and second order
with respect to reactant B. In this example, the rate equation would then be:

Rate ⫽ k[A][B]2

(If the exponent is 1, it is generally not shown.)

If the concentration of a reactant changes and that has no effect on the rate of
reaction, then the reaction is zero-order with respect to that reactant ([2]0 ⫽ 1).
Many times, we calculate the overall order of reaction: it is simply the sum of
the individual coefﬁcients, third order in this example.

Don’t Forget!

The rate law (the rate, the rate constant, and the orders of reaction) is determined
experimentally.

Once the rate has been determined, the orders of reaction can be determined
by conducting a series of reactions in which we change the concentrations of the
reactant species one at a time. We then mathematically determine the effect on
the reaction rate. Once the orders of reaction have been determined, we calcu-
late the rate constant.

Consider the reaction:

2 NO(g) ⫹ O2(g) l 2 NO2(g)

We collected the following kinetics data:

Experiment

3

Initial [NO]

0.01

Initial [O2]

0.01
0.01
0.02

Rate of NO2 formation (M/s)

0.05
0.20
0.10

There are a couple of ways that you might interpret the data above in order to
determine the rate equation. If the numbers involved are simple, then one can
reason out the orders of reaction. You can see that in going from experiment 1
to experiment 2, the [NO] doubles ([O2] held constant) and the rate increased
fourfold.  This  means  that  the  reaction  is  second  order  with  respect  to  NO.
Comparing experiments 1 and 3, you see that the [O2] doubles ([NO] was held

Kinetics

191

constant)  and  the  rate  doubled.  Therefore,  the  reaction  is  ﬁrst  order  with
respect to O2 and the rate equation is:

Rate ⫽ k[NO]2 [O2]

The rate constant can be determined by substituting the values of the concen-
trations of NO and O2 from any of the experiments into the rate equation above
and solving for k.

Using experiment 1: 

0.05 M/s ⫽ k[0.01 M]2 [0.01 M]

k ⫽ 0.05 M/s/[0.01 M]2 [0.01 M]
k ⫽ 5 ⫻ 104/M2s

However, sometimes because of the complexity of the numbers, you must manip-
ulate the equations mathematically. We use the ratio of the rate expressions of
two experiments to determine the reaction orders. We choose the equations so
that the concentration of only one reactant has changed while the others remain
constant. In the example above, we will use the ratio of experiments 1 and 2 to
determine the effect of a change of the concentration of NO on the rate. Then we
will use experiments 1 and 3 to determine the effect of O2. We cannot use exper-
iments 2 and 3 since both chemical species have changed concentration.

Don’t Forget!

In choosing experiments to compare, choose two in which the concentration of
only one reactant changes while the others remain constant.

Comparing experiments 1 and 2: 

0.05M/s ⫽ k[0.01]m[0.01]n
0.20M/s ⫽ k[0.02]m[0.01]n

Canceling the rate constants and the [0.01]n and simplifying gives:

R m

⫽ Q1

4

Thus, m ⫽ 2 (you can use logarithms to solve for m)

Comparing experiments 1 and 3:

0.05M/s ⫽ k[0.01]m[0.01]n
0.10M/s ⫽ k[0.01]m[0.02]n

192

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Canceling the rate constants and the [0.01]m and simplifying gives:

⫽ Q1

R n     Thus, n ⫽ 1

Therefore, the rate equation is: Rate ⫽ k[NO]2[O2]

The rate constant, k, could be determined by choosing any of the three experi-
ments, substituting the concentrations, rate, and orders into the rate expression,
and then solving for k.

13-3 Integrated Rate Laws (Time and

Concentration) 

So  far,  we  have  used  only  instantaneous  data  in  the  rate  expression.  These
expressions allow us to answer questions concerning the speed of the reaction
at a particular moment, but not questions like about how long it might take to
use up a certain reactant. However, if we take into account changes in the con-
centration  of  reactants  or  products  over  time,  as  expressed  in  the  integrated
rate laws, we can answer these types of questions.

Consider the following reaction: A l B

Assuming this reaction is ﬁrst order, we can express the rate of reaction as the
change in concentration of reactant A with time:

Rate ⫽ ⫺

⌬[A]
⌬t

 in addition to the rate law: Rate ⫽ k[A]

Setting these terms equal gives: 

⫺

⫽ k[A]

and integrating over time gives:

⌬[A]
⌬t
[A]0
[A]t

ln

⫽ kt

where,  ln  is  the  natural  logarithm,  [A]0 is  the  concentration  of  reactant  A  at
time ⫽ 0 and [A]t is the concentration of reactant A at some time t.

If the reaction is second order in A, we can derive the following equation using
the same procedure:

ments. The rate constant is 2.40 ⫻ 10⫺21/M s at 25°C. How long will it take for

Kinetics

193

the concentration of HI to drop from 0.200 M to 0.190 M at 25°C? Answer:
1.10 ⫻ 1020 s

This is a simple plug-in problem, with k ⫽ 2.40 ⫻ 10⫺21/M s, [A]0 ⫽ 0.200 M, and
[A]t ⫽ 0.190 M. You may simply plug in the values and then solve for t, or you ﬁrst
rearrange  the  equation  to  give  t  ⫽ (1/[A]t ⫺ 1/[A]0)/k.  You  will  get  the  same
answer in either case. If you get a negative answer, you interchanged [A]t and [A]0.

The  order  of  reaction  can  be  determined  graphically  by  using  the  integrated
rate law. If a plot of the ln[A] versus time yields a straight line, then the reac-
tion is ﬁrst order with respect to reactant A. If a plot of 1/[A] versus time yields
a straight line, then the reaction is second order with respect to reactant A.

The reaction half-life, t1/2, is the amount of time that it takes for a reactant con-
centration  to  decrease  to  one-half  its  initial  concentration.  For  a  ﬁrst-order
reaction, the half-life is a constant, independent of reactant concentration and
has the following relationship:

t1/2 ⫽

0.693

k

For second-order reactions, the half-life does depend on the reactant concen-
tration. We calculate it using the following formula:

Radioactive decay is a ﬁrst-order process. See Chapter 20 for a discussion of
half-lives related to nuclear reactions and other information on radioactivity.

The rate constant for the radioactive decay of thorium-232 is 5.0  ⫻ 10⫺11/year.
Determine the half-life of thorium-232.

This radioactive decay process follows ﬁrst-order kinetics. Substitute the value
of k into the appropriate equation:

13-4 Arrhenius and Activation Energy

A change in the reaction temperature affects the rate constant k. As the temper-
ature increases, the value of the rate constant increases and the reaction is faster.
The  Swedish  scientist,  Arrhenius,  derived  a  relationship  that  related  the rate
k ⫽ Ae⫺Ea/RT
constant and temperature. The Arrhenius equation has the form: 
.
In this equation, k is the rate constant and A is a term called the frequency fac-
tor that accounts for molecular orientation. The symbol e is the natural loga-
rithm base and R is universal gas constant. Finally, T is the Kelvin temperature
and Ea is the activation energy, the minimum amount of energy needed to ini-
tiate or start a chemical reaction.

∆Hrxn

We commonly use the Arrhenius equation to calculate the activation energy of
a  reaction.  One  way  to  do  this  is  to  plot  the  ln  of  k  versus  1/T.  This  gives  a
straight line whose slope is Ea/R. Knowing the value of R, we can calculate the
value of Ea.

Another method for determining the activation energy involves using a modiﬁ-
cation  of  the  Arrhenius  equation.  If  we  try  to  use  the  Arrhenius  equation
directly, we have one equation with two unknowns (the frequency factor and
the activation energy). The rate constant and the temperature are experimen-
tal values, while R is a constant. One way to prevent this difﬁculty is to perform
the experiment twice. We determine experimental values of the rate constant at
two  different  temperatures.  We  then  assume  that  the  frequency  factor  is  the
same at these two temperatures. We now have a new equation derived from the
Arrhenius equation that allows us to calculate the activation energy. This equa-
tion is:

Remember that the k in the denominator, k2, goes with the ﬁrst temperature, T2.

The two rate constant values, k1 and k2, are the values determined at two dif-
ferent temperatures, T1 and T2. The temperatures must be in Kelvin. The units
on the rate constants will cancel, leaving a unitless ratio. R is 8.314 J/mol⭈K. The
activation energy will have units of joules/mol.

The variation in the rate constant at two different temperatures for the decompo-
sition of HI(g) to H2(g) ⫹ I2(g) is given below. Calculate the activation energy.

Quick Tip

Activation  energy  values  are  normally  large,  positive  values.  If  your  answer
doesn’t meet these two conditions, you probably made an error in your calcula-
tion.  If  your  answer  is  negative,  the  most  likely  error  is  that  you  incorrectly
paired k1 and T1.

High  activation  energies  are  normally  associated  with  slow  reactions.  Anything
done to lower the activation energy of a reaction will tend to speed up the reaction.

13-5 Catalysis

A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of reaction without being con-
sumed in the reaction. A catalyst may take part in the reaction and even change
during  the  reaction,  but  at  the  end  of  the  reaction,  it  is  at  least  theoretically
recoverable in its original form. It will not produce more of the product, but it
allows the reaction to proceed more quickly. In equilibrium reactions, the cata-
lyst speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions. Catalysts speed up the
rates of reaction by lowering the activation energy of the reaction. In general,
there are two distinct types of catalysts.

Homogeneous catalysts are catalysts that are in the same phase or state of mat-
ter as the reactants. They provide an alternate reaction pathway with a lower
activation energy.

Kinetics

197

The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a slow, one-step reaction, especially
if the solution is kept cool and in a dark bottle:

2 H2O2 l 2 H2O ⫹ O2

However, adding ferric ion speeds up the reaction tremendously.

2 Fe3⫹ ⫹ H2O2 l 2 Fe2⫹ ⫹ O2 ⫹ 2 H⫹

2 Fe2⫹ ⫹ H2O2 + 2 H⫹

l 2 Fe3⫹ ⫹ 2 H2O

Notice that in the reaction, the catalyst, Fe3⫹, reduced to Fe2⫹, in the ﬁrst step
of the mechanism. In the second step, oxidation of Fe2⫹ back to Fe3⫹ occurred.
Overall then, the catalyst remains unchanged. Notice also that although the cat-
alyzed reaction is a two-step reaction, it is signiﬁcantly faster than the original
uncatalyzed one-step reaction.

A heterogeneous catalyst is in a different phase or state of matter than the reac-
tants.  Most  commonly,  the  catalyst  is  a  solid  and  the  reactants  are  liquids  or
gases. These catalysts provide a surface for the reaction. The reactant on the
surface  is  more  reactive  than  the  free  molecule.  Many  times  these  homoge-
neous catalysts are ﬁnely divided metals. Chemists use an iron catalyst in the
Haber process, which converts nitrogen and hydrogen gases into ammonia. The
automobile catalytic converter is another example.

13-6 Mechanisms

Many reactions proceed from reactants to products through a sequence of reac-
tions. This sequence of reactions is the reaction mechanism. For example, con-
sider the reaction:

A ⫹ 2B l E ⫹ F

Most likely, E and F do not form from the simple collision of an A and two B
molecules. This reaction might follow this reaction sequence:

A ⫹ B l C
C ⫹ B l D
D l E ⫹ F

If you add together the three equations above, you will get the overall equation
A ⫹ 2B l E ⫹ F. C and D are reaction intermediates, chemical species that are
produced and consumed during the reaction, but that do not appear in the over-
all reaction.

198

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Each individual reaction in the mechanism is an elementary step or reaction.
Each of these reaction steps has its own individual rate of reaction. One of the
reaction steps is slower than the rest and is the rate-determining step. This rate-
determining step limits how fast the overall reaction can occur. Therefore, the
rate law of the rate-determining step is the rate law of the overall reaction.

It  is  possible  to  determine  the  rate  equation  for  an  elementary  step  directly
from the stoichiometry. This will not work for the overall reaction. The reactant
coefﬁcients in an elementary step become the reaction orders in the rate equa-
tion for that elementary step.

Many  times  a  study  of  the  kinetics  of  a  reaction  gives  clues  to  the  reaction
mechanism. For example, consider the following reaction:
NO2(g) ⫹ CO(g) l NO(g) ⫹ CO2(g)

It has been determined experimentally that the rate law for this reaction is: Rate ⫽
k[NO2]2

The rate law indicates that the reaction does not occur with a simple collision
between NO2 and CO. The reaction might follow this mechanism:

NO2(g) ⫹ NO2(g) l NO3(g) ⫹ NO(g)
NO3(g) ⫹ CO(g) l NO2(g) ⫹ CO2(g)

Notice that if you add these two steps together, you get the overall reaction.
We have determined that the ﬁrst step is the slow step in the mechanism, the
rate-determining step. If we write the rate law for this elementary step it is:
Rate ⫽ k[NO2]2, identical to the experimentally determined rate law for the
overall reaction.

Note that both of the steps in the mechanism are bimolecular reactions, reac-
tions that involve the collision of two chemical species. Unimolecular reactions
are reactions in which a single chemical species decomposes or rearranges. Both
bimolecular and unimolecular reactions are common, but the collision of three
or more chemical species (termolecular) is quite rare. Thus, in developing or
assessing a mechanism, it is best to consider only unimolecular or bimolecular
elementary steps.

13-7 Utterly Confused About Rate

Law and Half-Life (t1/2) 

In order to work problems of this type it is important to know what the order
of the reaction is. This may come directly from the problem, for example, “the

Kinetics

199

reaction is ﬁrst order.” In some cases, the order comes indirectly from the prob-
lem, for example, “the rate law is Rate ⫽ k[A]2, which means the reaction is
second order.”

In most problems, it will be to your advantage to ﬁnd and label as many of the
following terms as possible: [A]0, [A]t, k, t, and t1/2. You will not need all these
terms for all problems. However, the ones you have, or do not have, often direct
you towards the solution.

Let’s  apply  the  preceding  two  paragraphs  to  an  example  problem.  The ﬁrst-
order decomposition of gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5, to nitrogen dioxide,
NO2, and oxygen, O2, has a rate constant of 4.9 ⫻ 10⫺4 s⫺1 at a certain tempera-
ture. Calculate the half-life of this reaction.

This  is  a  ﬁrst-order  reaction.  The  following  relationships  apply  to  ﬁrst-order
reactions:

Rate ⫽ k[A]        ln

[A]0
[A]t

⫽ kt      t1/2

⫽ 0.693

k

These are the only equations we have exclusive to ﬁrst-order reactions. For this
reason, one or more of these equations will be necessary to work the problem.
(In this problem, A ⫽ N2O5.)

Using the list of terms ([A]0, [A]t, k, t, and t1/2), and the given information, we
ﬁnd that k = 4.9 ⫻ 10⫺4 s⫺1 and t1/2 ⫽ ? (We are using a “?” to indicate the term
we are seeking.) The only ﬁrst-order relationship we have that relates k and t1/2
is t1/2 ⫽ 
. This signiﬁcantly limits our options to ﬁnishing the problem. To ﬁn-
ish the problem, we need to enter k into the relationship:

0.693

t1/2

⫽ 0.693

k

⫽

0.693

4.9 ⫻ 10⫺4 s⫺1

⫽ 1414.2857 ⫽ 1.4 ⫻ 103 s

Let’s try another example. A substance undergoes a simple decomposition. The
reaction is ﬁrst order. In one experiment, at 25°C, the concentration of this sub-
stance decreased from 1.000 M to 0.355 M after 4.25 min. What was the rate con-
stant for this reaction?

In this case, as in the preceding example, we have a ﬁrst-order reaction. This lim-
its us to the same set of three relationships as in the earlier example. Using the list
of terms ([A]0, [A]t, k, t, and t1/2), and the given information, we ﬁnd that k ⫽ ?,
[A]0 ⫽ 1.000 M, [A]t ⫽ 0.355 M, and t ⫽ 4.25 min. (We also know T ⫽ 25°C, but
since T is not one of the ﬁve terms, this is irrelevant.). The only ﬁrst-order
relationship with these four terms is ln  ⫽ kt. We can either enter the given values
into this equation, or we can rearrange the equation before entering the values.

[A]0
[A]t

We will now examine a problem that is not ﬁrst order. Molecules of butadiene
(C4H6) will dimerize to C8H12. The rate law is second order in butadiene, and the
rate constant is 0.014 L/mol⭈s. How many seconds will it take for the concentra-
tion of butadiene to drop from 0.010 M to 0.0010 M?

This is a second-order reaction. The following relationships apply to ﬁrst order
reactions:

[A]t

⫺ 1
[A]0

⫽ kt        t1/2

These are the only equations we have exclusive to second-order reactions. For
this reason, one or more of these equations will be necessary to work the prob-
lem. (In this problem, A is butadiene.)

Using the list of terms ([A]0, [A]t, k, t, and t1/2), and the given information, we
ﬁnd that k ⫽ 0.014 L/mol⭈s, [A]0 ⫽ 0.010 M, [A]t ⫽ 0.0010 M, and t ⫽ ? s The

Kinetics is the study of the speed of reactions. The speed of reaction is affected
by the nature of the reactants, the temperature, the concentration of reactants,
the physical state of the reactants, and catalysts. A rate law relates the speed of
reaction to the reactant concentrations and the orders of reaction. Integrated
rate laws relate the rate of reaction to a change in reactant or product concen-
tration over time. We may use the Arrhenius equation to calculate the activation

energy of a reaction. Catalysts are substances that speed up the rate of reaction
without being consumed in the reaction. They affect the reaction rate by low-
ering the activation energy by providing a reaction surface and orientation or
by providing an alternate mechanism (pathway). We may gather information
concerning the reaction mechanism from the rate laws.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you master the concept of chemical equilibria,
the  mathematical  representations  that  we  use  in  equilibrium  systems  and  the
manipulation  of  equilibrium  by  factors  such  as  temperature  and  pressure.
Chapters 15 and 16 will rely on the basic concepts presented in this chapter.
Mastering them here will make things much easier later. Mastering these con-
cepts will require, you guessed it, Practice, Practice, Practice.

14-1 Equilibrium 

Very  few  chemical  reactions  proceed  to  completion,  totally  using  up  one  or
more of the reactants and then stopping. Most reactions behave in a different
way. Consider the general reaction:

a A ⫹ b B l c C ⫹ d D

Reactants A and B are forming C and D. The reaction proceeds until appre-
ciable amounts of C and D form. Then it is possible for C and D to start to react
to form A and B.

c C ⫹ d D l a A ⫹ b B

These two reactions proceed until the two rates of reaction become equal. That
is, the speed of production of C and D in the ﬁrst reaction is equal to the speed
of production of A and B in the second reaction. Since these two reactions are
occurring simultaneously in the same container, the amounts of A, B, C, and D
become constant. 

A chemical equilibrium results when two exactly opposite reactions are occur-
ring at the same place, at the same time and with the same rates of reaction.
When a system reaches the equilibrium state the reactions do not stop. A and
B are still reacting to form C and D; C and D are still reacting to form A and B.
But because the reactions proceed at the same rate the amounts of each chem-
ical species are constant. This state is a dynamic equilibrium state to emphasize
the fact that the reactions are still occurring—it is a dynamic, not a static state.
A double arrow instead of a single arrow indicates an equilibrium state. For the
reaction above it would be:

a A ⫹ b B K c C ⫹ d D

Chemical Equilibria

Quick Tip

205

At equilibrium the concentrations of the chemical species are constant, but not
necessarily equal. There may be a lot of C and D and a little A and B or vice versa.
The concentrations are constant, unchanging, but not necessarily equal.

If the temperature is constant and the reaction is at equilibrium, then the ratio
of the two reactions, the forward and reverse, should become a constant. This
constant is the reaction quotient, Q, and has the following form:

Qc

⫽

[C]c[D]d
[A]a[B]b

This reaction quotient is a fraction. The numerator is the product of the chem-
ical species on the right hand side of the equilibrium arrow, each one raised to
the power of that species’ coefﬁcient in the balanced chemical equation. The
denominator is the product of the chemical species on the left hand side of the
equilibrium arrow, each one raised to the power of that species’ coefﬁcient in
the balanced chemical equation. It is called Qc, in this case, since molar con-
centrations are being used. If this was a gas phase reaction, gas pressures could
be used and it would become a Qp.

Don’t Forget!

Remember: products over reactants.

14-2 Equilibrium Constants (K)

We can write a reactant quotient at any point during the reaction, but the most
meaningful point is when the reaction has reached equilibrium. At equilibrium,
the reaction quotient becomes the equilibrium constant, Kc (or Kp if gas pres-
sures are being used). We usually express this equilibrium constant simply as a
number without units since it is a ratio of concentrations or pressures. In addition,

206

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

the concentrations of solids or pure liquids (not in solution) that appear in the
equilibrium expression are assumed to be 1, since their concentrations do not
change.

Don’t Forget!

The concentrations of pure solids and liquids do not appear in the equilibrium
constant expression.

Consider the Haber process for the production of ammonia: N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) K
2 NH3(g).

The equilibrium constant expression is: Kc ⫽

[NH3]2
[N2][H2]3

If the partial pressures of the gases were used, then the Kp would be written in
the following form:

Kp ⫽

2
PNH3
3
PN2
PH2

There is a relationship between the Kc and the Kp: Kp ⫽
where R is
the ideal gas constant and ⌬ng is the change in the number of moles of gas in the
reaction.

Kc(RT)⌬ng

Careful!

Be sure that your value of R is consistent with the units chosen for the partial
pressures of the gases.

The  numerical  value  of  the  equilibrium  constant  gives  an  indication  of  the
extent of the reaction after reaching equilibrium. If Kc is large, then that means
the numerator is much larger than the denominator and the reaction has pro-
duced a relatively large amount of products (reaction lies far to the right). If Kc
is  small,  then  the  numerator  is  much  smaller  than  the  denominator  and  not
much product has been formed (reaction lies far to the left).

Chemical Equilibria

207

14-3 Le Châtelier’s Principle

Le Châtelier discovered that if a chemical system at equilibrium is stressed (dis-
turbed) it will reestablish equilibrium by shifting the rates of the reactions involved.
This means that the amounts of the reactants and products will change, but the ratio
will remain the same. One can stress the equilibrium in a number of ways: changes
in concentration, pressure, and temperature. However, a catalyst will have no effect
on the equilibrium amounts since it affects both the forward and reverse reactions
equally. It will simply allow the reaction to reach equilibrium faster.
Changes in Concentration
If the stress to the equilibrium system is a change in concentration of one of the
reactants or products, then the equilibrium will react to remove that stress. If, for
example, we decrease the concentration of a chemical species, the equilibrium
will shift to produce more of it. In doing so, the concentration of chemical species
on the other side of the reaction arrows will be decreased. If the concentration of
a chemical species is increased, the equilibrium will shift to consume it, increas-
ing the concentration of chemical species on the other side of the reaction arrows. 

For example, again consider the Haber process: N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) L 2 NH3(g).
If one increases the concentration of hydrogen gas then the equilibrium shifts
to the right in order to consume some of the added hydrogen. In doing so, the
concentration of ammonia (NH3) will increase and the concentration of nitro-
gen gas will decrease. 

Don’t Forget!

The  concentrations  may  change,  but  the  value  of  Kc or  Kp would  remain  the
same.

Changes in Pressure
Changes in pressure are only signiﬁcant if there are gases involved. The pres-
sure may be changed by changing the volume of the container or by changing
the concentration of a gaseous species. If the container becomes smaller, the
pressure increases because there are an increased number of collisions on the
inside  walls  of  the  container.  This  stresses  the  equilibrium  system  and  it  will
shift in order to reduce the pressure. A shift towards the side of the equation
that has the least number of moles of gas will accomplish this. If the container

208

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

size is increased, the pressure decreases and the equilibrium will shift to the side
containing the most number of moles of gas in order to increase the pressure. If
the number of moles of gas is the same on both sides, then changing the pres-
sure will not have an effect on the equilibrium.

Once again consider the Haber reaction: N2(g) + 3 H2(g) K 2 NH3(g). Note that
on the left side there are 4 mol of gas (1 of nitrogen and 3 of hydrogen) and
2  mol on the right. If the container is made smaller, the pressure increases
and the equilibrium will shift to the right because 4 mol of gas would be con-
verted to 2 mol. In doing so, the concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen gases
would decrease and the concentration of ammonia would increase. 

Don’t Forget!

Pressure effects are only important for gases.

Changes in Temperature
Changing the temperature really changes the amount of heat in the system and
is similar to a concentration effect. In order to treat it in this fashion, one must
know which reaction, forward or reverse, is exothermic (releasing heat).

Once again, let’s consider the Haber reaction: N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) K 2 NH3(g). The
formation of ammonia is exothermic (liberating heat), so that we could write
the reaction as: 

N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) K 2 NH3(g) ⫹ heat

If  the  temperature  of  the  reaction  mixture  is  increased,  the  amount  of  heat
increases and the equilibrium would shift to the left in order to consume the
added  heat.  In  doing  so,  the  concentration  of  nitrogen  and  hydrogen  gases
would increase and the concentration of ammonia gas would decrease. 

Don’t Forget!

A change in the temperature is the only way to change the value of K.

Chemical Equilibria

209

Given the following equilibrium (endothermic as written), predict what changes,
if  any,  would  occur  if  the  following  stresses  are  applied  after  equilibrium  was
established?

CaCO3(s) K CaO(s) ⫹ CO2(g)

a. Add CO2
b. Remove CO2
c. Add CaO
d. Increase T
e. Decrease V
f. Add a catalyst

Answers:

a. Left—the equilibrium shifts to remove some of the excess CO2.
b. Right—the equilibrium shifts to replace some of the CO2.
c. No Change—solids do not shift equilibria unless they are totally removed.
d. Right—endothermic reactions shift to the right when heated.
e. Left—a decrease is volume, or an increase in pressure, will shift the equi-

librium towards the side with less gas.

f. No Change—catalysts do not affect the position of an equilibrium.

14-4 Utterly Confused About

Equilibria Problems

Don’t Forget!

Equilibria problems require an equilibrium constant expression in nearly every
case.  You  should  begin  each  problem  with  this  expression.  This  will  get  you
started on the problem.

Let’s do a series of equilibria problems. You should pay close attention not only
to what is different about each problem, but also to what is the same.

210

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

A container has the following equilibrium established at 700°C:

N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) K 2 NH3(g)

The equilibrium mixture had an ammonia concentration of 0.120 M, a nitrogen
concentration of 1.03 M, and a hydrogen concentration of 1.62 M. Determine the
value of the equilibrium constant, Kc.

Careful!

Temperatures often appear in equilibria problems, but most problems will not
require you to use the temperature.

The ﬁrst step in this, and most equilibria problems, should begin by writing the
equilibrium constant expression. In this case, the expression is:

Kc ⫽

[NH3]2
[N2] [H2]3

Quick Tip

This step will, in most cases, get you some partial credit.

The problem gives us: [NH3] ⫽ 0.120 M, [N2] ⫽ 1.03 M, and [H2] ⫽ 1.62 M. The
next step is to enter the given values into the equilibrium constant expression
and enter the values into your calculator.

Kc ⫽

[1.03] [1.62]3

The equilibrium value for the following equilibrium is 2.42 ⫻ 10⫺3 at a certain
temperature. N2(g) ⫹ 3 H2(g) K 2 NH3(g) Determine the ammonia concentra-
tion at equilibrium with 2.00 M nitrogen and 3.00 M hydrogen.

Chemical Equilibria

Careful!

211

Even when the same reaction is involved, the K may be different. This is because
the value of K changes with temperature. Always use the speciﬁed K even if it is
different from a similar example.

The ﬁrst step in this, and most equilibria problems, should begin by writing the
equilibrium constant expression. In this case, the expression is:

Kc ⫽

[NH3]2
[N2] [H2]3

The problem gives us: [N2] ⫽ 2.00 M and [H2] ⫽ 3.00 M. The next step is to
enter the given values into the equilibrium constant expression and rearrange
the  expression  to  isolate  the  ammonia.  Some  people  ﬁnd  it  easier  to  reverse
these steps.

Determine the value of Kp for the following equilibrium: C(s) ⫹ CO2(g) K
2CO(g). At equilibrium, the carbon monoxide, CO, pressure is 1.22 atm and the
carbon dioxide, CO2, pressure is 0.780 atm.

The ﬁrst step in this, and most equilibria problems, should begin by writing the
equilibrium constant expression. In this case, the expression is for a Kp so pres-
sures must be present. The expression is:

Kp ⫽

P2
CO
PCO2

Don’t Forget!

Never include a solid in an equilibrium expression.

212

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The problem gives us: PCO ⫽ 1.22 atm, and PCO2
⫽ 0.780 atm. The next step is
to enter the given values into the equilibrium constant expression and enter the
values into your calculator.

Kp ⫽

P2
CO
PCO2

⫽

(1.22)2
(0.780)

⫽ 1.9082 ⫽ 1.91

Calculate Kc for the preceding equilibrium at 25°C.

This is one of the few problems where an equilibrium expression is not neces-
sary. It is also one of the few cases where the temperature is important.

We will begin this problem by writing the equation that relates Kp and Kc:

Kp = Kc [RT]⌬ng

Don’t Forget!

The “g” subscript, which may not appear in this equation in your textbook, is a
reminder to focus only on the mole of gas present in the equilibrium reaction.

We have the following values given to us: Kp ⫽ 1.91, T ⫽ 25°C, and R (from
Chapter 5 on gas laws) = (0.0821 L⭈atm/mol⭈K). The presence of the kelvin tem-
perature unit in the value for R should serve as a reminder to convert °C to K.
The temperature is 298 K.

We need to determine the value of ⌬ng. We ﬁnd this value from the reaction:
C(s) ⫹ CO2(g) L 2 CO(g). We ignore the solid. There is 1 mol of gas on the
reactant side and 2 mol of gas on the product side, therefore, ⌬ng ⫽ (2 ⫺ 1).

We can now enter these values into the equation to get:

B¢ 0.0821 L·atm

≤ (298 K)R (2 ⫺ 1)

1.91 ⫽ Kc

mol·K

Kc ⫽ 0.07806816 ⫽ 0.0781

We will ﬁnish this section by examining one of the most common types of equi-
libria problems.

Chemical Equilibria

213

For the reaction: I2(g) K 2 I(g) at a certain temperature, the value of K is 3.76 ⫻
10⫺5. If the initial I2 concentration is 0.500 M, what will be the equilibrium con-
centrations of I2(g) and I(g)?

Quick Tip

A generic K usually means Kc. Your instructor may specify you to treat a generic
K in some other way.

The ﬁrst step in this, and most equilibria problems, you should begin by writing
the equilibrium constant expression. In this case, the expression is:

K ⫽

[I]2
[I2]

⫽ 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5

In this problem, we know the initial concentration of iodine and we want to ﬁnd
a new concentration at equilibrium. Looking for a new concentration is a very
strong hint to create a reaction table. To begin a reaction table, you need to list
each  substance  present  in  the  reaction  at  the  head  of  a  column.  Below  each
heading, you should enter the initial value for each substance. In this case, our
table will begin as:

Initial

I2
0.500

I
0

The problem only speciﬁed an initial I2 concentration. Any unspeciﬁed initial
value appears as a zero in the table.

The next line in the table will include information on how the initial values will
change. A zero value in the table indicates how the change will occur. The equi-
librium concentration of any substance can never be zero. Since the iodine atom
concentration is initially equal to zero, we must add some quantity to this. The
source of these iodine atoms must be the iodine molecules. This will result in a
decrease in the concentration of iodine molecules. If we assume that the change
in the molarity of iodine molecules is x, then, based on the reaction stoichiom-
etry, the iodine atom concentration change will be 2x. This information begins
the next line in our table:

Initial
Change

I2
0.500
⫺ x

I

⫹ 2 x

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

214

Quick Tip

The coefﬁcients of the x’s will be the same as the coefﬁcients in the equilibrium
reaction equation.

In order to complete the table we need to add each column to get the equilib-
rium values:

Initial
Change
Equilibrium

I2
0.500

0.500 ⫺ x

I

⫹2 x
⫹2 x

This type of table is an Initial/Change/Equilibrium (ICE) table. The acronym
comes from the ﬁrst letter of the names for each row of the table. The bottom
row of the ICE table goes into your equilibrium expression:

K ⫽

[I]2
[I2]

=

[2 x]2

[0.500 ⫺ x]

⫽ 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5

There are two ways to complete the problem from this point. Your instructor
may specify one method or the other in which case you should do what your
instructor wishes. We will show you both methods.

The ﬁrst method involves an assumption. Any time the value of the equilibrium
constant is very large or very small, an assumption is possible. In this case, the
constant is very small. A small equilibrium constant indicates that only a small
number  of  iodine  molecules  will  break  apart  to  become  iodine  atoms.  This
means that x will be small. A small x value means that 0.500 ⫺ x will be close to
0.500 M. As an assumption, we will assume that 0.500 ⫺ x is 0.500 M.

Don’t Forget!

Any time you make an assumption, you will need to check the validity of the
assumption. Your instructor will tell you what determines a valid assumption.

Chemical Equilibria

215

If we use our assumption in the equilibrium expression, it changes as indicated
below:

K ⫽

[I]2
[I2]

⫽

[2 x]2

[0.500 ⫺ x]

⫽

[2 x]2
[0.500]

⫽

[4 x2]
[0.500]

⫽ 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5

We can now rearrange this equation and determine the value of x:

x ⫽

Å 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5(0.500)

4

⫽ 2.1679 ⫻ 10⫺3 (unrounded)

To ﬁnish the problem, we must enter this value into the bottom line of our table:

Initial

0.500 ⫺ 2.1679 ⫻ 10⫺3

⫹2 x
⫹2 x
⫹2 (2.1679 ⫻ 10⫺3)

The equilibrium concentration of I2 ⫽ 0.498 M and the equilibrium concentra-
tion of I is 4.34 ⫻ 10⫺3 M. At this point you should apply whatever method your
instructor wants you to use to determine the validity of the assumption.

Quick Tip

If you enter your answers into the equilibrium expression, the result should be
near K.

If you do not or cannot use the assumption method, then it is necessary to do
the problem the “long way.” We will go back to this point.

K ⫽

[I2]

[2 x]2

[0.500 ⫺ x]

If we do not neglect the x in the denominator, we must rearrange this equation to:

4 x2 ⫽ (0.500 ⫺ x)(3.76 ⫺ 10⫺5)

We rearrange this to:

4 x2 ⫹ 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5 x ⫺ 1.88 ⫻ 10⫺5 ⫽ 0

216

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

This is in the quadratic form, and, as such, requires you to use the quadratic
equation.

x ⫽

⫺ b ⫾ 2b2 ⫺ 4 ac

2 a

In this case, a ⫽ 4, b ⫽ 3.76 ⫻ 10⫺5, and c ⫽ ⫺1.88 ⫻ 10⫺5. If we enter these val-
ues into the quadratic equation we get x ⫽ 2.16 ⫻ 10⫺3 or x ⫽ ⫺2.17 ⫻ 10⫺3.
The quadratic equation always gives two answers. We can eliminate one of the
answers since it is physically impossible to have a negative concentration. This
leaves us with only the positive root. If we enter this answer into the bottom line
of our table, we get the following equilibrium concentrations:

[I2] ⫽ 0.500 ⫺ 2.16 ⫻ 10⫺3 ⫽ 0.498 M
[I] ⫽ 2(2.16 ⫺ 10⫺3) ⫽ 4.32 ⫻ 10⫺3 M

Get Started

Our  goal  in  this  chapter  is  to  help  you  understand  the  equilibrium  systems
involving  acids  and  bases.  If  you  don’t  recall  the  Arrhenius  acid-base  theory,
refer to Chapter 4 on Aqueous Solutions. You will learn a couple of other acid-
base theories, the concept of pH, and will apply those basic equilibrium tech-
niques we covered in Chapter 14 to acid-base systems. In addition, you will need
to be familiar with the log and 10x functions of your calculator. And, as usual, in
order to do well you must Practice, Practice, Practice.

15-1 Brønsted-Lowery Acids and Bases

An  acid  in  the  Brønsted-Lowery  theory  is  an  H+ donor  and  a  base  is  an  H+
acceptor. In the Brønsted-Lowery acid-base theory, there is a competition for
an H+. Consider the acid-base reaction between acetic acid, a weak acid, and
ammonia, a weak base:

CH3COOH(aq) ⫹ NH3(aq) K CH3COO⫺(aq) ⫹ NH4

⫹(aq)

Acetic acid donates a proton to ammonia in the forward (left to right) reaction of
the equilibrium to form the acetate and ammonium ions. However, in the reverse
(right to left) reaction, the ammonium ion donates a proton to the acetate ion to
form ammonia and acetic acid. The ammonium ion is acting as an acid and the
acetate ion a base. Under the Brønsted-Lowery system, acetic acid (CH3COOH)
and the acetate ion (CH3COO⫺) are conjugate acid-base pairs. Conjugate acid-
base pairs differ by only a single H⫹. Ammonia (NH3) and the ammonium ion
⫹) are also conjugate acid-base pairs. In this reaction, there is a competition
(NH4
for the H⫹ between acetate ion and ammonia. In order to predict on which side
the equilibrium will lie, this general rule applies: the equilibrium will favor (shift
towards) the side in which the weakest acid and base are present.

15-2 Strength of Acids and Bases

In Chapter 4, we introduced the concept of acids and bases. Acids and bases
may be strong or weak. Strong acids completely dissociate in water and weak
acids only  partially  dissociate.  For  example,  consider  two  acids  HCl  (strong)
and CH3COOH (weak). If we add each to water to form aqueous solutions, the
following reactions take place:

HCl(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) l H3O⫹(aq) ⫹ Cl⫺(aq)

CH3COOH(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K H3O⫹(aq) ⫹ CH3COO⫺(aq)

Acids and Bases

Don’t Forget!

221

H⫹ and H3O⫹ represent the same chemical species.

The ﬁrst reaction goes to completion—there is no HCl left in solution. The sec-
ond reaction is an equilibrium reaction—there are appreciable amounts of both
reactants and products left in solution.

There are generally only two strong bases to consider—the hydroxide ion and
those species that produce hydroxide ion in aqueous solution. All other bases
are weak. Weak bases also establish an equilibrium system, as in aqueous solu-
tions of ammonia:

NH3(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K OH⫺(aq) ⫹ NH4

⫹(aq)

Strong bases include:
Alkali metal (Group IA) hydroxides
(LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH and CsOH)
Calcium, strontium, and barium hydroxides

Strong acids include:
Chloric acid, HClO3
Hydrobromic acid, HBr
Hydrochloric acid, HCl
Hydroiodic acid, HI
Nitric acid, HNO3
Perchloric acid, HClO4
Sulfuric acid, H2SO4

15-3 Kw—the Water Dissociation

Constant

Water  is  amphoteric.  It  will  act  as  either  an  acid  or  a  base,  depending  upon
whether the other species is a base or acid. In pure water, we ﬁnd the same ampho-
teric nature. In pure water, a very small amount of proton transfer is taking place:

H2O(l) ⫹ H2O(l) K H3O⫹(aq) ⫹ OH⫺(aq)

This is commonly written as: H2O(l) K H⫹(aq) ⫹ OH⫺(aq)

There  is  an  equilibrium  constant,  called  the  water  dissociation  constant,  Kw,
that describes this equilibrium:

Kw ⫽ [H3O⫹] [OH⫺] ⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺14 at 25oC

222

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Don’t Forget!

The concentration of water is a constant and is incorporated into the Kw.

The numerical value for the Kw of 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺14 is for the product of the [H⫹]
and [OH⫺] in pure water and for all aqueous solutions.

In  an  aqueous  solution,  there  are  two  sources  of  H⫹,  the  acid  and  water.
However, the amount of H⫹ that the water dissociation contributes is very small
and is normally easily ignored.

15-4 pH 

Because the concentration of the hydronium ion, H3O⫹ (or H⫹ as a shorthand
notation), can vary tremendously in solutions of acids and bases, a scale to rep-
resent  the  acidity  of  a  solution  was  developed.  This  is  the  pH  scale,  which
relates to the [H3O⫹]:

pH ⫽ ⫺log [H3O⫹] or ⫺log [H⫹] using the shorthand notation.

Remember that in pure water Kw ⫽ [H3O⫹] [OH⫺] ⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺14. Since both
the hydronium ion and hydroxide ions form in equal amounts, x, the Kw expres-
sion is:

[x]2 ⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺14

Quick Tip

The value of Kw only applies at or near room temperature. This value, like all equi-
librium constants will vary with temperature.

Solving for [x] gives us x ⫽ [H3O⫹] ⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺7. If you then calculate the pH
of pure water:

pH ⫽ ⫺log [H3O⫹] ⫽ ⫺log [1.00 ⫻ 10⫺7] ⫽ ⫺(⫺7.00) ⫽ 7.00

Acids and Bases

223

The pH of pure water is 7.00 and on the pH scale, this is neutral. A solution that
has  a  [H3O⫹]  is  greater  than  pure  water  will  have  a  pH  less than  7.00  and  is
acidic. A  solution  that  has  a  [H3O⫹]  is  less  than  pure  water  will  have  a  pH
greater than 7.00 and is basic.

It is also possible to calculate the pOH of a solution. It is deﬁned as pOH =
⫺log [OH⫺]. The pH and the pOH are related:

pH ⫹ pOH ⫽ pKw ⫽ 14.00 at 25oC

Calculate the pH and pOH of a 0.025M nitric acid solution.

Write the dissociation reaction for nitric acid, a strong acid: 

HNO3(aq) l H⫹(aq) ⫹ NO3

⫺(aq)

Since nitric acid is a strong acid, the contribution to the [H⫹] from the nitric acid
will  be  0.025  M.  The  contribution  of  water  to  the  [H⫹]  will  be  insigniﬁcant.
Thus, [H⫹] ⫽ 0.025

pH ⫽ ⫺log [H⫹] ⫽ ⫺log [.025] ⫽ ⫺(⫺1.60) ⫽ 1.60

pOH ⫽ 14.00 ⫺ pH ⫽ 14.00 ⫺ 1.60 ⫽ 12.40

A solution had a pH ⫽ 8.75. Calculate the [H⫹] and [OH⫺] of the solution.

We may determine the [H⫹] of the solution from the pH using the inverse log
function on our calculator or by using the relationship:

[H⫹] ⫽ 10⫺pH

[H⫹] ⫽ 10⫺8.75 ⫽ 1.8 ⫻ 10⫺9 M

To calculate the [OH⫺] we will use the Kw relationship: Kw ⫽ [H3O⫹] [OH⫺]

[OH⫺] ⫽

Kw

[H3O⫹]

⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10⫺14
1.8 ⫻ 10⫺9

⫽ 5.6 ⫻ 10⫺6M

15-5 Acid-Base Equilibrium (Ka and Kb)

The Ka—Acid Dissociation Constant
Strong acids completely dissociate (ionize) in water. Weak acids partially disso-
ciate and establish an equilibrium system. There is a large range of weak acids
based upon their ability to donate protons. Consider the general weak acid HA
and its reaction when placed in water:

HA(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K H3O⫹(aq) ⫹ A⫺(aq)

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

224

Quick Tip

The HA is not necessarily neutral, and the A⫺ does not necessarily have a nega-
tive charge.

We can write an equilibrium constant expression for this system:

Kc ⫽

[H3O⫹][A⫺]

[HA]

Don’t Forget!

The [H2O] is assumed to be a constant and is incorporated into the Ka value. It
does not appear in the equilibrium constant expression.

Since this is the equilibrium constant associated with a weak acid dissociation, this
particular Kc is the weak acid dissociation constant, Ka. The Ka expression is:

Ka ⫽

[H3O⫹][A⫺]

[HA]

Many times, we will show the weak acid dissociation reaction in a shortened
notation omitting the water:

HA(aq) K H⫹(aq) ⫹ A⫺(aq) with the Ka ⫽

[H⫹][A⫺]

[HA]

The greater the amount of dissociation, the larger the value of the Ka. Refer to
your textbook for a table of Ka values.

Quick Tip

For every H⫹ formed there is an A⫺ formed.

Acids and Bases

Quick Tip

225

The [HA] is the equilibrium molar concentration of the undissociated weak acid, not
its initial concentration. The exact expression would then be [HA] ⫽ Minitially ⫺
[H⫹],  where  Minitially is  the  initial  concentration  of  the  weak  acid.  This  is  true
because  for  every  H⫹ that  is  formed  an  HA  must  have  dissociated.  However,
many times if the Ka is small, you can approximate the equilibrium concentration
of the weak acid by its initial concentration, [HA] Minitially.

<

If we know the initial molarity and Ka of the weak acid, we can easily calculate
the [H⫹] or [A⫺]. If we know the initial molarity and [H⫹], it is possible to cal-
culate the Ka.

Quick Tip

Different sources may give different values for Ka, always use the values given to
you by your instructor or textbook. 

For polyprotic acids, acids that can donate more than one proton, the Ka for the
ﬁrst dissociation is much larger than the Ka for the second dissociation. If there
is a third Ka, it is much smaller still. For most practical purposes, you can sim-
ply use the ﬁrst Ka.
Kb—the Base Dissociation Constant
Weak bases (B), when placed into water, also establish an equilibrium system
much like weak acids:

B(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K HB⫹(aq) ⫹ OH⫺ (aq)

The equilibrium constant expression is the weak base dissociation constant, Kb,
and has the form:

Kb ⫽

[HB⫹][OH⫺]

[HB]

226

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The same reasoning that was used in dealing with weak acids is also true here:
[HB⫹] ⫽ [OH⫺]; [HB] Minitially; the numerator can be represented as [OH⫺]2;
and knowing the initial molarity and Kb of the weak base, the [OH⫺] can be calcu-
lated. If we know the initial molarity and [OH⫺], it is possible to calculate the Kb.

<

Quick Tip

Different sources may give different values for Kb, always use the values given to
you by your instructor or textbook.

The Ka and Kb of conjugate acid-base pairs are related through the Kw expression:

KaKb ⫽ Kw

15-6 Acid-Base Properties
of Salts and Oxides 

Some salts have acid-base properties. Ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, when dis-
solved in water will dissociate and the ammonium ion will act as a weak acid,
donating a proton. The strong bases previously listed are all salts that dissolve
yielding the hydroxide ion (which is really the base, not the salt).

Certain oxides can have acid or basic properties. Many oxides of metals that
have a ⫹1 or ⫹2 charge are basic oxides because they will react with water to
form a basic solution:

Na2O(s) ⫹ H2O(l) l 2 NaOH(aq)

Many nonmetal oxides are acidic oxides because they react with water to form
an acidic solution:

CO2(g) ⫹ H2O(l) l H2CO3(aq)

Another  salt-like  group  of  compounds  that  have  acid-base  properties  is  the
hydrides  of  the  alkali  metals  and  calcium,  strontium,  and  barium.  These
hydrides will react with water to form the hydroxide ion and hydrogen gas:

KH(s) ⫹ H2O(l) l KOH(aq) ⫹ H2(g)

Acids and Bases

227

15-7 Lewis Acids and Bases 

Another acid-base theory is the Lewis acid-base theory. According to this the-
ory, a Lewis acid will accept a pair of electrons and a Lewis base will donate a
pair  of  electrons.  In  order  to  make  it  easier  to  see  which  species  is  donating
electrons, it is helpful to use Lewis structures for the reactants and if possible
for the products.

The following is an example of a Lewis acid-base reaction.

H⫹(aq) ⫹ :NH3(aq) l H–NH3

⫹(aq)

The hydrogen ion accepts the lone pair of electrons from the ammonia to form
the ammonium ion. The hydrogen ion, because it accepts a pair of electrons, is
the  Lewis  acid.  The  ammonia,  because  it  donates  a  pair  of  electrons,  is  the
Lewis  base.  This  reaction  is  also  a  Brønsted-Lowry  acid-base  reaction.  This
illustrates that a substance may be an acid or a base by more than one deﬁni-
tion. All Brønsted-Lowry acids are Lewis acids, and all Brønsted-Lowry bases
are Lewis bases. However, the reverse is not necessarily true.

15-8 Utterly Confused About Weak

Acids and Bases 

Let’s begin with a series of acid-base equilibria problems.

Calculate the [H⫹] of a 0.300 M acetic acid solution. Ka ⫽ 1.8 ⫻ 10⫺5

This problem has many similarities to the last worked example in the Utterly
Confused section in Chapter 14.

We do not have a reaction given, therefore we must write one. The “a” sub-
script in the Ka tells use the equation must look like this:

HC2H3O2(aq) K H⫹(aq) ⫹ C2H3O2

⫺(aq)

As always, H⫹(aq) is the same as H3O⫹(aq).

We need to write the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction:

Ka ⫽

[H⫹] [C2H3O2
[HC2H3O2]

⫽ 1.8 ⫻ 10⫺5

228

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

You should always write an equilibrium constant expression.

We can now create an ICE table:

We can enter the values from the equilibrium line into the equilibrium constant

[0.300 ⫺ x]

⫽ 1.8 ⫻ 10⫺5

Your instructor may allow you to simplify this expression by assuming 0.300 ⫺
x ⫽ 0.300 M. If your instructor does not allow this simpliﬁcation, you will need
to do a quadratic. 

The hydrogen ion concentration is x ⫽ [H⫹] ⫽ 2.3 ⫻ 10⫺3 M. Thus, the solution
is acidic.

Quick Tip

The pH of any acid solution mustbe below 7 and the [H⫹] must be greater than
10⫺7 M. The pH of any base solution mustbe above 7 and the [OH⫺] must be
greater the 10⫺7 M ([H⫹] < 10⫺7 M). If your results disagree with this, you have
made an error.

Now let us try an example using a weak base.

A 0.500 M solution of ammonia has a pH of 11.48. What is the Kb of ammonia?

Acids and Bases

229

We do not have a reaction given, therefore we must write one. The “b” sub-
script in the Kb tells us the equation must look like this:

NH3(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K NH4

We need to write the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction:

There is one additional piece of information in the problem, and that is the pH.
From the pH we can determine the hydrogen ion concentration:

pH ⫽ 11.48

[H⫹] ⫽ 10⫺11.48
[H⫹] ⫽ 3.3 ⫻ 10⫺12 M

From the hydrogen ion concentration and Kw we can determine the hydroxide

we can substitute 3.0 ⫻ 10⫺3 into the equilibrium expression for x and enter the

230

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

In our ﬁnal example, we will do a problem with a twist.

Determine the pH of a 0.200 M strontium acetate solution.

Strontium acetate is neither a weak acid nor a weak base—it is a salt. As a sol-
uble salt, it is a strong electrolyte and it will dissociate as follows:

Sr(C2H3O2)2(aq) l Sr2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 C2H3O2

⫺(aq)

The resulting solution has 0.200 M Sr2⫹ (we do not need this value) and 2(0.200 M)
⫺.
⫽ 0.400 M C2H3O2

We can ignore ions such as Sr2⫹, which come from strong acids or strong bases
in this type of problem. Ions, such as C2H3O2
⫺, from a weak acid or a base, weak
acid in this case, will undergo hydrolysis, a reaction with water. The acetate ion
is the conjugate base of acetic acid (Ka ⫽ 1.74 ⫻ 10⫺5). Since acetate is a weak
base, this will be a Kb problem, and OH⫺ will form. The equilibrium is:

C2H3O2

⫺(aq) ⫹ H2O(l) K OH⫺(aq) ⫹ HC2H3O2(aq)

Don’t Forget!

You can ignore ions from a strong acid or a strong base. You must work with ions
from a weak acid or a weak base.

The equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:

Acids and Bases

231

We need to determine the value of Kb to ﬁnish the problem. We know Ka and
we know that KaKb ⫽ Kw ⫽ 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺14. Therefore, we can ﬁnd Kb from:

Kb ⫽

Kw
Ka

⫽

1.0 ⫻ 10⫺14

⫽

[x] [x]

[0.400 ⫺ x]

⫽ 5.7471 ⫻ 10⫺10

From this equation, we can determine that x ⫽ 1.51619 ⫻ 10⫺5 M (unrounded).
This is the hydroxide ion concentration.

There are two ways to determine the pH from the hydroxide ion concentration.
One method uses Kw while the other method uses the pOH of the solution. The
Kw approach is:

Kw ⫽ [H⫹] [OH⫺] ⫽ 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺14

[H⫹] ⫽

[OH⫺]

⫽

pH ⫽ ⫺log [H⫹] ⫽ ⫺log (6.5955 ⫻ 10⫺10) ⫽ 9.18076 ⫽ 9.18

The pOH method begins by determining the pOH of the solution:

pOH ⫽ ⫺log [OH⫺] ⫽ ⫺log (1.51619 ⫻ 10⫺5) ⫽ 4.8192 (unrounded)

Next we use the relationship pKw ⫽ pH ⫹ pOH ⫽ 14.00

pH ⫽ pKw ⫺ pOH ⫽ 14.00 ⫺ 4.8192 ⫽ 9.18

Both methods give us a basic solution, which we should expect from a base like
the acetate ion.

Quick Tip

The pH of any acid solution mustbe below 7 and the [H⫹] must be greater than
10⫺7 M. The pH of any base solution mustbe above 7 and the [OH⫺] must be
greater the 10⫺7 M ([H⫹] < 10⫺7 M). If your results disagree with this, you have
made an error.

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

Brønsted-Lowery acids are H+ donors and bases are H+ acceptors. Strong acids
dissociate completely in water. Weak acids only partially dissociate, establishing
an equilibrium system. Weak acid and base dissociation constants (Ka and Kb)
describe these equilibrium systems. Water is amphoteric, acting as both an acid
or a base. We describe water’s equilibrium by the Kw expression. A pH value is
a way of representing a solution’s acidity. Some salts and oxides have acid-base
properties. A Lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor while a Lewis base is an

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you continue learning about acid-base equi-
librium systems and, in particular, buffers and titrations. If you are a little unsure
about equilibria and especially weak acid-base equilibria, review Chapters 14 and
15. You will also learn to apply the basic concepts of equilibria to solubility and
complex ions. Two things to remember: (1) The basic concepts of equilibria apply
to allthe various types of equilibria, and (2) Practice, Practice, Practice.

16-1 The Common Ion Effect

If a slightly soluble salt solution is at equilibrium and we add a solution con-
taining one of the ions involved in the equilibrium, the solubility of the slightly
soluble salt decreases. For example, consider the PbSO4 equilibrium:

PbSO4(s) K Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq)

Suppose  we  add  a  solution  of  Na2SO4 to  this  equilibrium  system.  The  addi-
tional  sulfate  ion  will  disrupt  the  equilibrium  by  Le  Châtelier’s  principle  and
shift it to the left. This decreases the solubility. The same would be true if you
tried to dissolve PbSO4 in a solution of Na2SO4 instead of pure water—the sol-
ubility would be less. This application of Le Châtelier’s principle to equilibrium
systems of a slightly soluble salt is the common-ion effect.

16-2 Buffers and pH

Buffers are solutions that resist a change in pH when we add an acid or base. A
buffer contains both a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate base (A⫺). The acid
part will neutralize any base added and the base part of the buffer will neutralize
any acid added to the solution. We may calculate the hydronium ion concen-
tration  of  a  buffer  by  rearranging  the  Ka expression  to  yield  the  Henderson-
Hasselbalch equation, which we can use to calculate the pH of a buffer:

pH ⫽ pKa ⫹ log

[A⫺]
[HA]

or using the Kb expression: pOH ⫽ pKb ⫹ log

[HA]
[A⫺]

These equations allow us to calculate the pH of the buffer solution knowing the
Ka of the weak acid or Kb of the weak base and the concentrations of the weak
acid and its conjugate base. If we know the desired pH along with the Ka of the

Buffers and Other Equilibria

237

weak acid, then the ratio of base to acid can be calculated. The more concen-
trated the acid and base components are, the more acid or base can be neutralized
and the less the change in buffer pH. This is a measure of the buffer capacity,
the ability to resist a change in pH.

16-3 Titrations and Indicators

An acid-base titration is a laboratory procedure that we use to determine the
concentration of an unknown solution. We add a base solution of known con-
centration to an acid solution of unknown concentration (or vice versa) until an
acid-base indicator visually signals that the endpoint of the titration has been
reached. The equivalence point is the point at which we have added a stoichio-
metric amount of the base to the acid. 

238

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

If the acid being titrated is a weak acid, then there are equilibria that will be
established  and  accounted  for  in  the  calculations.  (See  the  Utterly  Confused
section at the end of the chapter.) Typically, a plot of pH of the weak acid solu-
tion  being  titrated  versus  the  volume  of  the  strong  base  added  (the  titrant)
starts  at  a  low  pH  and  gradually  rises  until  close  to  the  equivalence  point  in
which the curve rises dramatically. After the equivalence point region, the curve
returns to a gradual increase. We can see this in Figure 16-1.

Figure 16-1 Titration of a weak acid with a strong base

16-4 Solubility Equilibria (Ksp) 

Many salts are soluble in water, but others are only slightly soluble. These salts,
when placed in water, quickly reach their solubility limit and the ions establish
an equilibrium system:

PbSO4(s) K Pb2⫹(aq) ⫹ SO4

2⫺(aq)

The equilibrium constant expression associated with systems of slightly soluble
salts is the solubility product constant, Ksp. It is the product of the ionic con-
centrations,  each  one  raised  to  the  power  of  the  coefﬁcient  in  the  balanced
chemical  equation.  It  contains  no  denominator  since  the  concentration  of  a
solid is, by convention, 1, and for this reason it does not appear in the equilib-
rium constant expression. The Ksp expression for the PbSO4 system is:

Ksp ⫽ [Pb2⫹] [SO4

2⫺]

Buffers and Other Equilibria

239

Don’t Forget!

There is never a denominator in a Ksp expression.

For this particular salt, the value of the Ksp is 1.6 ⫻ 10⫺8 at 25⬚C. If we know the
value of the solubility product constant, then we can determine the concentra-
tion of the ions. In addition, if we know one of the ion concentrations, then we
can ﬁnd the Ksp.

The Ksp of magnesium ﬂuoride in water is 8 ⫻ 10⫺8. How many grams of mag-
nesium ﬂuoride will dissolve in 0.250 L of water?

MgF2(s) K Mg2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 F⫺(aq)

Ksp ⫽ [Mg2⫹][F⫺]2 ⫽ 8 ⫻ 10⫺8

When  solving  common-ion-effect  problems,  calculations  like  the  ones  above
involving ﬁnding concentrations and Ksp’s can still be done, but the concentra-
tion of the additional common ion will have to be inserted into the solubility
product constant expression. Sometimes, if the Ksp is very small and the com-
mon ion concentration is large, we can simply approximate the concentration of
the common ion by the concentration of the ion added.

Knowing the value of the solubility product constant can also allow us to pre-
dict whether or not a precipitate will form if we mix two solutions, each con-
taining an ion component of a slightly soluble salt. We calculate the reaction
quotient (many times called the ion product), which has the same form as the
solubility product constant. We take into consideration the mixing of the vol-
umes of the two solutions, and then compare this reaction quotient to the Ksp.
If it is greater than the Ksp then precipitation will occur until the ion concentra-
tions reduce to the solubility level.

solution, will BaSO4 precipitate? Ksp for BaSO4 ⫽ 1.1 ⫻ 10⫺10

In order to answer this question, we will need the concentration of the barium
ion and the sulfate ion before precipitation. These may be determined from the
dilution relationship:

Mdil ⫽ MconVcon/Vdil.

For Ba2⫹: Mdil ⫽ (0.100 M) (10.0 mL)/(10.0 ⫹ 40.0)mL ⫽ 0.0200 M
For SO4

2⫺: Mdil ⫽ (0.0250 M) (40.0 mL)/(50.0 mL) ⫽ 0.0200 M

Inserting these values into the reaction quotient relationship gives:

Q ⫽ [Ba2⫹][SO4

2⫺] ⫽ (0.0200)(0.0200) ⫽ 0.000400 ⫽ 4.00 ⫻ 10⫺4

4.00 ⫻ 10⫺4 > 1.1 ⫻ 10⫺10

Since Q is greater than Ksp, precipitation will occur.

Quick Tip

A reaction quotient, Q, calculation will always use initial concentrations. There
are never any x values.

16-5 Complex Ion Equilibria (Kf) 

We can treat other types of equilibria in much the same way as the ones previously
discussed. For example, there is an equilibrium constant associated with the for-
mation of complex ions. This equilibrium constant is the formation constant, Kf.

2⫹(aq) is 7.8 ⫻ 108, indicating that the equilibrium lies to the right.

16-6 Utterly Confused About

pH and Titrations

Let’s examine a typical titration problem. A homework or exam problem may
utilize only one of the steps we will see in this problem, or you may need to
work all these steps. The goal of each step is to determine the pH of the solu-
tion. You should be careful not to lose sight of this goal.

In many cases, you may know the initial concentration of the weak acid, but may
be interested in the pH changes during the titration. In order to do this you can
divide the titration curve into four distinctive areas in which the pH is calculated.

This ﬁrst section is the initial pH. This is the point in the titration preceding the
addition of any reactant. You must ignore the reactant to be added in this region.
If a strong acid or a strong base is present, there are no signiﬁcant equilibria. The
strong acid gives the hydrogen ion concentration directly, while a strong base gives
the  hydroxide  ion  concentration  directly.  If  a  weak  acid  is  present,  this  is  a
generic Ka problem, and you can ﬁnd the hydrogen ion concentration from this. If
a weak base is present, this is a generic Kb problem, and you can ﬁnd the hydrox-
ide ion concentration from this. The hydrogen ion concentration directly gives you
the pH, while the hydroxide ion concentration will give you the pH indirectly.

In all other portions of the titration curve, you must consider both the substance
already in the container and the amount added. Calculations in these regions
will begin as a limiting reagent problem. The results of the limiting reagent cal-
culation will tell you how to ﬁnish the problem.

To do a limiting reagent problem you need to know how many moles of reac-
tant  are  in  the  original  container  and  how  many  moles  of  the  other  reactant

242

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

have been added. Usually you will ﬁnd the moles by multiplying the concentra-
tion by the volume of the solution. In a few cases, you may ﬁnd the number of
moles from the mass and the molar mass.

In the second region of the titration curve, the substance added is the limiting
reagent. As a limiting reagent, it is no longer present to affect the pH. The other
reactant is in excess, and this excess will have an affect upon the pH. The moles
of excess reactant divided by the total volume of the solution (the initial volume
plus the volume of the solution added) gives the concentration. The solution
also contains the products of the reaction. If the excess reactant is either a weak
acid  or  a  weak  base,  the  concentration  of  the  products  will  be  important.  A
buffer solution will be present any time you have an excess of a weak acid or
weak base along with its conjugate.

The next point in the titration curve is the equivalence point. At this point,
both the material added and the material originally present are limiting. At
this  point,  neither  of  the  reactants  will  be  present  and  therefore  will  not
affect the pH. If the titration involves a strong acid and a strong base, the pH
at the equivalence point is 7. If the titration involves a weak base, only the
conjugate acid is present to affect the pH. This will require a Ka calculation.
If  the  titration  involves  a  weak  acid,  only  the  conjugate  base  is  present  to
affect the pH. This will require a Kb calculation. The calculation of the con-
jugate acid or base will be the moles produced divided by the total volume of
the solution.

The ﬁnal  region  of  the  titration  curve  is  after  the  equivalence  point.  In  this
region, the material originally present in the container is limiting. The excess
reagent, the material added, will affect the pH. If this excess reactant is a weak
acid or a weak base, this will be a buffer solution.

Let’s use the following example to see how to deal with each of these regions.
This will be a titration of the weak acid with a strong base.

A 100.0 mL sample of 0.150 M nitrous acid (pKa ⫽ 3.35) was titrated with 0.300 M
sodium hydroxide, NaOH. Determine the pH of the solution after the following
quantities of base have been added to the acid solution: a. 0.00 mL, b. 25.00 mL,
c. 50.00 mL, and d. 55.00 mL.

a. 0.00 mL. Since no NaOH has been added, this is the initial pH section of the
titration curve.

The only substance present is nitrous acid, HNO2, a weak acid. Since this is a
weak acid, this must be a Ka problem. As a Ka problem, we can set up a simple
equilibrium problem:

The initial pH of this weak acid is, as expected, acidic.

b. 25.00 mL This will be in the second region of the titration curve. (We usu-
ally cannot predict this by simple inspection.) To do this, and all later steps, we
will require the balanced chemical equation for the reaction and the moles of
each reactant.

The reaction is:

We will need the moles of HNO2 in all the remaining steps in this problem. The
moles of NaOH will be changing as we add more. The coefﬁcients in the reac-
tion are all ones, thus, we can simply compare the moles to ﬁnd the limiting
reactant. The sodium hydroxide, with the smaller number of moles is limiting.
We  can  add  the  mole  information  to  the  balanced  chemical  equation.  (The
water, being neutral, will not be tracked.)

After the reaction, the moles of sodium hydroxide, limiting reagent, are zero;
therefore, sodium hydroxide no longer affects the pH. The solution only con-
tains unreacted nitrous acid, sodium ions, nitrite ions, and water. Cations com-
ing from a strong base do not affect the pH, so we do not need to worry about
the sodium ions. Water will not affect the pH either. The nitrous acid and its con-
⫺,  will  inﬂuence  the  pH.  Nitrous  acid  and  the
jugate  base,  the  nitrite  ion,  NO2
nitrite ion are a conjugate acid-base pair of a weak acid, and the presence of both
in the solution makes the solution a buffer. We need to ﬁnish the stoichiometry
part of the problem by determining the molarity of each of these substances.

We can now use these two values for the equilibrium portion of the problem.
There are two options for this buffer solution. We can use these concentrations
in a Ka calculation, or we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Either
method  will  give  you  the  same  answer;  however,  the  Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation is faster.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

pH ⫽ pKa ⫹ log

The pKa appears in the problem (3.35), HA is nitrous acid, and A⫺ is the nitrite

When the titration is at the halfway point (concentration of the conjugate acid
equals the concentration of the conjugate base), the pH will equal the pKa, and
the pOH will equal the pKb.

This is the pH for this point in the second region. All other calculations in this
region work this way.

The only substance remaining in the solution that can inﬂuence the pH is the
nitrite ion. This ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid. Since a base is present,
the pH will be above 7. The presence of this weak base means this is a Kb prob-
lem. However, before we can attack the equilibrium portion of the problem, we
must ﬁnish the stoichiometry part by ﬁnding the concentration of the nitrite ion.

We can now proceed to the equilibrium portion of the problem. To do this we
need  the  Kb.  We  can  ﬁnd  the  Kb from  the  following  series  of  relationships

Either we can use the hydroxide ion with the Kw to ﬁnd the hydrogen ion con-

this is true because the preceding part gave us the equivalence point.) After the
equivalence point, the substance added will be excess and the other substance
is limiting. In this case, the sodium hydroxide will be in excess and the nitrous
acid will be limiting.

We  need  to  deal  with  the  stoichiometry  of  this  reaction.  For  this  reason,  we
need to know the moles of each of the reactants. We already found the initial

There are two bases present after the reaction. Both of these could inﬂuence

The common-ion effect is an application of Le Châtelier’s principle to equilib-
rium systems of slightly soluble salts. A buffer is a solution that resists a change
in pH if we add an acid or base. We can calculate the pH of a buffer using the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. We use titrations to determine the concen-
tration of an acid or base solution. We can represent solubility equilibria by the
solubility product constant expression, Ksp. We can use the concepts associated
with weak acids and bases to calculate the pH at any point during a titration.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you learn the laws of thermodynamics, espe-
cially  the  concepts  of  entropy  and  free  energy.  It  might  be  helpful  to  review
Chapter  6  on  thermochemistry  and  the  writing  of  thermochemical  equations.
The concept of Gibbs free energy (G) will be useful in predicting whether or not
a  reaction  will  occur  spontaneously.  Just  like  in  all  the  previous  chapters,  in
order to do well you must Practice, Practice, Practice.

17-1 The Three Laws of Thermodynamics

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics states that the total energy of the universe is
constant. This is simply the law of conservation of energy. We can state this rela-
tionship as:

∆Euniverse ⫽ ∆Esystem ⫹ ∆ Esurroundings ⫽ 0

Don’t Forget!

You should refer back to Chapter 6 for a discussion of the terms system, sur-
roundings, and universe.

The second law of thermodynamics involves a term called entropy. Entropy is
a measure of the degree that energy disperses from a localized state to one that
is more widely spread out. We may also think of entropy (S) as a measure of the
disorder  of  a  system.  The  second  law  of  thermodynamics  states  that  all
processes  that  occur  spontaneously  move  in  the  direction  of  an  increase  in
entropy  of  the  universe  (system  ⫹ surroundings).  For  a  reversible  process,  a
system at equilibrium, ∆Suniverse ⫽ 0. We can state this as:

∆Suniverse ⫽ ∆Ssystem ⫹ ∆Ssurroundings > 0  for a spontaneous process

According to this second law, the entropy of the universe is continually increas-
ing. The third law of thermodynamics states that for a pure crystalline substance
at 0 K the entropy is zero.

Entropy and Free Energy

17-2 Entropy 

253

The qualitative entropy change (increase or decrease of entropy) for a system
can sometimes be determined using a few simple rules:

1. Entropy increases when the number of molecules increases during a reaction.
2. Entropy increases with an increase in temperature.
3. Entropy increases when a gas forms from either a liquid or solid.
4. Entropy increases when a liquid forms from a solid.
In  much  the  same  fashion  as  the  ∆H⬚ was  tabulated,  the  standard  molar
entropies (S⬚) of elements and compounds are tabulated. This is the entropy
associated with 1 mol of a substance in its standard state. Unlike the enthalpies,
the entropies of elements are not zero. For a reaction, it is possible to calculate
the standard entropy change in the same fashion as the enthalpies of reaction:

∆S⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆S⬚products ⫺ ⌺∆S⬚reactants

17-3 Gibbs Free Energy 

One of the goals of chemists is to be able to predict if a reaction will be sponta-
neous. A reaction may be spontaneous if its ∆H is negative or if its ∆S is positive,
but neither one is a reliable predictor by itself about whether or not a reaction
will  be  spontaneous.  Temperature  also  plays  a  part.  A  thermodynamic  factor
that takes into account the entropy, enthalpy, and temperature of the reaction
would be the best indicator of spontaneity. This factor is the Gibbs free energy.

The Gibbs free energy (G) is:

G ⫽ H ⫺ TS

where T is the Kelvin temperature

Like most thermodynamic functions, it is only possible to measure the change
in Gibbs free energy, so the relationship becomes:

∆G ⫽ ∆H ⫺ T∆S

If there is a ∆G associated with a reaction and we reverse that reaction, the sign
of the ∆G changes.
∆G  is  the  best  indicator  chemists  have  as  to  whether  or  not  a  reaction  is
spontaneous:
• If ∆G > 0, the reaction is not spontaneous; energy must be supplied to cause

the reaction to occur

254

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

• If ∆G < 0, the reaction is spontaneous; energy will be released
• If ∆G ⫽ 0, the reaction is at equilibrium; there will be no gain or loss of energy

Just like with the enthalpy and entropy, the standard Gibbs free energy change,
(∆G°), is calculated:

∆G⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆G⬚products ⫺ ⌺∆G°reactants

The ∆Gf⬚ of an element in its standard state is zero.

17-4 Free Energy and Reactions

We may also calculate ∆G° for a reaction by using the standard enthalpy and
standard entropy of reaction:

∆G⬚ ⫽ ∆H⬚rxn ⫺ T∆S⬚rxn

It is possible to use this equation when the temperature is not standard. The
∆H⬚rxn and the ∆S⬚rxn values vary slightly with temperature. This slight variation
allows an approximation of ∆G° at temperatures that are not standard.

In  other  cases,  where  the  conditions  are  not  standard,  you  should  use  the
relationship:

∆G ⫽ ∆G° ⫹ RT ln Q

The ∆G symbol refers to the nonstandard Gibbs free energy value, ∆G° is the
standard value, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol⭈K), T is the temperature (K),
and  Q  is  the  reaction  quotient  ﬁrst  seen  in  Chapter  14.  At  equilibrium,  this
equation becomes:

0 ⫽ ∆G° ⫹ RT ln K or ∆G° = ⫺RT ln K

K is the equilibrium constant.

Be Careful!

The value of R uses joules and the value of the Gibbs free energy is typically in
kilojoules. You will often need to change joules to kilojoules or kilojoules to joules.

17-5 Utterly Confused About

Thermodynamics

Let’s work a few examples of problems employing information from this chapter.
Determine the value of ∆S° for each of the following reactions.

a. H2(g) ⫹ 1/2 O2(g) l H2O(g)
b. H2(g) ⫹ 1/2 O2(g) l H2O(l)

Don’t Forget!

These are thermochemical equations. Fractions are acceptable in thermochemi-
cal equations.

To begin the problem, we need the standard entropy values for each of the reac-
tants and products. These are the values we’ll be using to complete this problem:

H2(g)
O2(g)
H2O(g)
H2O(l)

131.0 J/mol⭈K
205.0 J/mol⭈K
188.7 J/mol⭈K
69.9 J/mol⭈K

Be Careful!

Make sure you use the correct value from the table of values. As seen in this
example, the value for liquid water is not the same as for gaseous water.

Quick Tip

Unless your instructor has told you to memorize speciﬁc thermochemical values,
you will be provided the numbers you need. Most textbooks have a table of val-
ues in the chapter and an additional table in Appendix.

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

256

Be Careful!

Unlike  heats  of  formation  and  Gibbs  free  energies  of  formation,  the  standard
entropy values for elements are not zero.

To ﬁnish this problem we need to use the following relationship:

∆S⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆S⬚products ⫺ ⌺∆S⬚reactants

For part a:

∆S⬚ ⫽ [(1 mol H2O)(188.7 J/mol⭈K)] ⫺ [(1 mol H2)(131.0 J/mol⭈K)

For part b:

⫹ (1/2 mol O2)(205.0 J/mol⭈K)]

∆S⬚ ⫽ ⫺163.6 J/K

Be Careful!

Many students make the mistake of only subtracting the ﬁrst of the reactant
values from the product values. You must subtract the SUM of the reactant
values from the product values.

Determine the value of ∆G⬚ for the following reaction:

2 NH4Cl(s) ⫹ CaO(s) l CaCl2(s) ⫹ H2O(l) ⫹ 2 NH3(g)

To begin the problem, we need the standard Gibbs free energy values for each
of the reactants and products. These are the values we’ll be using to complete
this problem:

Quick Tip

All  sources  may  not  contain  identical  values  for  thermodynamic  values.
Thermodynamic values are revised from time to time. You should use whatever
values your instructor or textbook provides.

To ﬁnish this problem we need to use the following relationship:

∆G⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆G⬚products ⫺ ⌺G⬚reactants
∆G⬚ ⫽ [(1 mol CaCl2)(⫺750.2 kJ/mol) ⫹ (1 mol H2O)(⫺237.2 kJ/mol)

⫹ (2 mol NH4Cl)(⫺203.9 kJ/mol)]

Using the relationship: ∆G° ⫽ ∆H°rxn – T∆S°rxn, calculate ∆G° for the following
reaction.

2 Al(s) ⫹ 3 S(s) ⫹ 6 O2(g) l Al2(SO4)3(s)

To begin the problem, we need the standard enthalpy and entropy values for
each of the reactants and products. These are the values we’ll be using to com-
plete this problem:

Quick Tip

The ⌬Hf⬚ (and the ⌬Gf⬚) for elements in their standard states are zero. It is not
necessary to search for these values. If you are in doubt, you can look for the
values in a table.

We need to use the following relationships before using the designated equation:

∆H⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆H⬚products ⫺ ⌺∆H⬚reactants
∆S⬚ ⫽ ⌺∆S⬚products ⫺ ⌺∆S⬚reactants

Solving these two relationships gives:

∆H⬚ ⫽ [(1 mol Al2(SO4)3)(⫺3441 kJ/mol)] ⫺ [(2 mol Al)(0 kJ/mol)

⫹ (3 mol S)(0 kJ/mol) ⫹ (6 mol O2)(0 J/mol⭈K)]

We can now enter these results into the given equation. We will also need a
kJ/J unit conversion.

Don’t Forget!

The degree symbol indicates standard conditions. This means you should use
298 K as the temperature.

At  its  melting  point  the  heat  of  fusion  for  aluminum  is  10.04  kJ/mol,  and  the
entropy of fusion is 9.50 J/mol⭈K. Estimate the melting point of aluminum.

The  freezing  point  (or  the  melting  point)  is  an  equilibrium  process.  For  any
equilibrium process, ∆G is equal to 0. We can add this information to the fol-
lowing equation:

This equation rearranges to:

A system, at 298 K, contains the following gases NO, O2, and NO2. These gases
are part of the following reaction:

The concentrations of the gases are: NO ⫽ 2.00 M, O2 ⫽ 0.500 M, and NO2 ⫽
1.00 M. Determine ⌬G for the system.

Even though the system is at standard temperature, the system is not standard
because  the  concentrations  are  not  all  one.  For  this  reason,  we  must  use  the
relationship:

⌬G ⫽ ⌬G° ⫹ RT ln Q

Don’t Forget!

Anytime one or more of the following conditions are not met, the system is not
standard, and this equation must be used. The conditions are 298 K, 1 M (for
any reactant or product), and 1 atm (for any reactant or product that is a gas).

Before we can use this equation, we need to write the expression for Q:

In addition to writing the Q expression, we also need to determine the value of
⌬G⬚ before using the equation. We can ﬁnd ⌬G⬚ using the following relation-

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics states that the total energy of the universe is
constant.  The  second  law  of  thermodynamics  states,  that  in  all  spontaneous
processes, the entropy of the system increases. Entropy is a measure of the dis-
persion  of  energy  from  a  localized  one  to  a  more  disperse  one.  It  can  be

related to the disorder of the system. Entropy increases when the number of
molecules increases, with an increase in temperature, when a gas forms from a
solid or liquid or when a liquid forms from a solid. Gibbs free energy is the best
indicator of a spontaneous reaction. If ∆G > 0, the reaction is not spontaneous;
if ∆G < 0, the reaction is spontaneous; and if ∆G ⫽ 0, the reaction is at equilib-
rium. It is possible to use the ∆G and the temperature to calculate the equilib-

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to help you understand how to balance redox equa-
tions,  know  the  different  types  of  electrochemical  cells,  and  how  to  solve
electrolysis problems. Have your textbook handy—you may need to ﬁnd some
information in electrochemical tables. We will be using the mole concept, so if
you need some review refer to Chapter 3, especially the mass/mole relationships.
You  might  also  need  to  review  the  section  concerning  net-ionic  equations  in
Chapter 4. And don’t forget to Practice, Practice, Practice.

18-1 Redox Reactions

Electrochemical reactions involve redox reactions. Redox is a term that stands
for reduction and oxidation. Reduction is the gain of electrons and oxidation is
the loss of electrons. For example, if you place a piece of zinc metal in a solu-
tion containing the Cu2⫹ ion. A reddish solid forms on the surface of the zinc
metal. That substance is copper metal. At the molecular level, the zinc metal is
losing electrons to form the Zn2⫹ cation and the Cu2⫹ ion is gaining electrons to
form copper metal. These two processes (called half-reactions) are: 

Zn(s) l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2e⫺
Cu2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2e⫺
l Cu(s)

(oxidation)
(reduction)

The  electrons  lost  by  the  zinc  metal  are  the  same  electrons  gained  by  the
copper(II) cation. The zinc metal is oxidized (loses electrons and increases
its  oxidation number) and the copper(II) ion is reduced (gains electrons and
decreases its oxidation number).

The reactant causing the oxidation to take place is the oxidizing agent (the reac-
tant  undergoing  reduction).  In  the  example  above,  the  oxidizing  agent  is  the
Cu2⫹ ion. The reactant undergoing oxidation is the reducing agent because it
furnishes the electrons that are necessary for the reduction half-reaction. Zinc
metal is the reducing agent. The two half-reactions, oxidation and reduction,
can be added together to give you the overall redox reaction. When doing this,
the electrons must cancel—that is, there must be the same number of electrons
lost as electrons gained:

Zn ⫹ Cu2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2e⫺

l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2e⫺ ⫹ Cu or

Zn ⫹ Cu2⫹(aq) l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ Cu

Electrochemistry

267

Some redox reactions may be simply balanced by inspection. However, many
are complex and require the use of a systematic method. There are two meth-
ods commonly used to balance redox reactions: the oxidation number method
and the ion-electron method.

Quick Tip

Your text or instructor may give you what appears to be a variation of these steps.
The words may differ, but the ideas behind each step are the same.

To balance a redox reaction using the oxidation number method, follow the fol-
lowing rules:

1. Assign oxidation numbers to all elements in the reaction.
2. Identify  what  undergoes  oxidation  and  what  undergoes  reduction  by  the

change in oxidation numbers.

3. Calculate the number of electrons lost in oxidation and electrons gained in

reduction.

4. Multiply  one  or  both  of  these  numbers  by  factors  to  make  electron  loss

equal to electron gain and then use them as balancing coefﬁcients.

5. Complete the balancing by inspection.

To balance a redox reaction using the ion-electron method, follow the follow-
ing rules: (Several variations of this method are used.)

1. Assign oxidation numbers and begin the half-reactions, one for oxidation,

and one for reduction.

2. Balance all atoms except O and H.
3. Balance oxygen atoms.
4. Balance hydrogen atoms.
5. Balance charges by adding electrons.
6. Adjust the half-reactions to give equal numbers of electrons.
7. Add and cancel (the electrons must cancel)
8. Check

Quick Tip

In using either of these methods, you must follow the rules in the order listed.

Check with your instructor to see which method is preferred.

18-2 Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells

Galvanic (voltaic) cells produce electricity by using a redox reaction. Let’s take that
zinc/copper redox reaction that we studied before (the direct electron transfer one)
and make it a galvanic cell by separating the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. 

V

Zn

Cu

Zn2+

Cu2+

Instead of one container, we will use two. We place a piece of zinc metal in one,
a piece of copper metal in another. We add a solution of aqueous zinc sulfate
to the beaker containing the zinc electrode and an aqueous solution of cop-
per(II) sulfate to the beaker containing the copper metal. The zinc and copper
metals will form the electrodes of the cell, the solid portion of the cell that con-
ducts  the  electrons  that  are  involved  in  the  redox  reaction.  The  solutions  in
which we immerse the electrodes are the electrode compartments. We connect
the  electrodes  by  a  wire  and  complete  the  circuit  with  a  salt  bridge.  A  salt
bridge is often an inverted U-tube containing a concentrated electrolyte solu-
tion, such as KNO3. The anions in the salt bridge will migrate through the gel
into  the  beaker  containing  the  zinc  metal  and  the  salt-bridge  cations  will
migrate  in  the  opposite  direction.  In  this  way,  both  electrode  compartments
maintain electrical neutrality. The zinc electrode is being oxidized in one beaker
and the copper(II) ions in the other beaker are being reduced to copper metal.
The same redox reaction is happening in this indirect electron transfer as hap-
pened in the direct one:

Zn(s) ⫹ Cu2⫹(aq) l Zn2⫹(aq) ⫹ Cu(s)

Electrochemistry

269

The difference is that the electrons are now ﬂowing through a wire from the oxi-
dation  half-reaction  to  the  reduction  half-reaction.  The  ﬂow  of  electrons
through a wire is electricity. If we connect a voltmeter to the wire connecting
the two electrodes, we would measure a current of 1.10 V. This galvanic cell is
a Daniell cell.

The electrode at which oxidation is taking place is called the anode and the elec-
trolyte  solution  in  which  it  is  immersed  is  called  the  anode compartment.  The
electrode at which reduction takes place is the cathode and its solution is the cath-
ode compartment. We label the anode with a negative sign (⫺), while the cath-
ode has a positive sign (⫹). The electrons ﬂow from the anode to the cathode.

Don’t Forget!

Oxidation is an anode process.

Sometimes the half-reaction(s) involved in the cell do not have a solid conduc-
tive part to act as the electrode, so an inert (inactive) electrode, a solid con-
ducting  electrode  that  does  not  take  part  in  the  redox  reaction,  is  used.
Graphite and platinum are common inert electrodes.

Cell notation is a shorthand notation of representing a galvanic cell. To write
the cell notation for the Daniell cell you:

1. Write the chemical formula of the anode: Zn(s)
2. Draw a single vertical line to represent the phase boundary between the

anode and the anode compartment: Zn(s) |

3. Write the reactive part of the anode compartment with its initial concentra-
tion (if known) in parenthesis (assume 1 M in this case): Zn(s) | Zn2⫹(1 M)
4. Draw a double vertical line to represent the salt bridge connecting the two

electrode compartments: Zn(s) | Zn2⫹(1 M) ||

5. Write the reactive part of the cathode compartment with its initial concen-

tration (if known) shown in parenthesis: Zn(s) | Zn2⫹(1 M) || Cu2⫹(1 M)

6. Draw a single vertical line representing the phase boundary between the

cathode compartment and the cathode: Zn(s) | Zn2⫹(1 M) || Cu2⫹(1 M) |

7. And ﬁnally write the chemical formula of the cathode: Zn(s) | Zn2⫹(1 M) ||

Cu2⫹(1M) | Cu(s)

270

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

If there is an inert electrode present, then show where the inert electrode is with
its phase boundary. If the electrode components are in the same phase, then
separate them by commas; if not, a vertical phase boundary line. For example,
consider the following redox reaction:

Ag⫹(aq) ⫹ Fe2⫹(aq) l Fe3⫹(aq) ⫹ Ag(s)

The oxidation of the ferrous ion to ferric doesn’t involve a solid, so we must use
an inert electrode, such as platinum. The cell notation would then be:

Pt(s) | Fe2⫹(aq), Fe3⫹(aq) || Ag⫹(aq) | Ag(s)

18-3 Standard Reduction Potentials (Eⴗ) 

In the discussion of the Daniell cell, we indicated that this cell produces a
voltage of 1.10 V. This voltage is really the difference in potential between
the  two  half-cells.  The  cell  potential  (really  the  half-cell  potentials)  is
dependent upon concentration and temperature, but initially we’ll simply
look at the half-cell potentials at the standard state of 298 K (25⬚C) and all
components  in  their  standard  states  (1M  concentration  of  all  solutions,  1
atm pressure for any gases and pure solid electrodes). Half-cell potentials
appear in tables as the reduction potentials, that is, the potentials associat-
ed  with  the  reduction  reaction.  We  define  the  hydrogen  half-reaction
(2H⫹(aq) ⫹ 2e⫺
l H2(g))  as  the  standard  and  has  been  given  a  value  of
exactly 0.00 V. We measure all the other half-reactions relative to it; some
are  positive  and  some  are  negative.  Find  the  table  of  standard  reduction
potentials in your textbook.

Quick Tip

Here are some things to be aware of in looking at this table:

• All reactions appear in terms of the reduction reaction relative to the standard

hydrogen electrode.

• The more positive the value of the voltage associated with the half-reaction

(E⬚) the more readily the reaction occurs.

• The strength of the oxidizing agent increases as the value becomes more positive,
and the strength of the reducing agent increases as the value becomes more
negative.

Electrochemistry

271

We can use this table of standard reduction potentials to write the overall cell
reaction  and  to  calculate  the  standard  cell  potential,  the  potential  (voltage)
associated with the cell at standard conditions. There are a couple of things to
remember when using these standard reduction potentials to generate the cell
reaction and cell potential:

1. Since the standard cell potential is for a galvanic cell, it must be a positive

value, E⬚ > 0.

2. Since one half-reaction must involve oxidation, we must reverse one of the
half-reactions shown in the table of reduction potentials in order to indicate
the oxidation. If we reverse the half-reaction, we must also reverse the sign
of the standard reduction potential. 

3. Since oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode, the stan-
dard cell potential can be calculated from the standard reduction potentials of
the two half-reactions involved in the overall reaction by using the equation:

E⬚cell ⫽ E⬚cathode – E⬚anode > 0

But remember both the E⬚cathode and E⬚anode values are shown as reduction
potentials, used directly from the table without reversing.

Once you have calculated the standard cell potential, then the reaction can be
written by reversing the half-reaction associated with the anode (show it as oxi-
dation) and adding the two half-reactions.

Don’t forget that the number of electrons lost must equal the number of elec-
trons gained. If they are not equal, use appropriate multipliers to ensure that
they are equal. 

Calculate the potential of a cell using the following half-cells:

Ni2⫹ ⫹ 2 e⫺
Ag⫹ ⫹ e⫺

l Ni(s)
l Ag(s)

E⬚ ⫽ ⫺0.25 V
E⬚ ⫽ 0.80 V

First, calculate the cell potential using:

E⬚cell ⫽ E⬚cathode ⫺ E⬚anode > 0

Since  the  cell  potential  must  be  positive  (a  galvanic  cell)  there  is  only  one
arrangement of ⫺0.25 and 0.80 V than can result in a positive value:

E⬚cell ⫽ 0.80 V ⫺ (⫺0.25 V) ⫽ 1.05 V

This  means  that  the  Ni  electrode  is  the  anode  and  is  involved  in  oxidation.
Therefore,  we  reverse  the  reduction  half-reaction  involving  Ni,  changing  the

272

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

sign of the standard half-cell potential and add it to the silver half-reaction. We
must multiply the silver half-reaction by two to equalize electron loss and gain,
but the half-cell potential is not:

Ni(s) l Ni2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺
2(Ag⫹(aq) ⫹ e⫺
Ni(s) ⫹ 2 Ag⫹(aq) l Ni2⫹(aq) ⫹ Ag(s) 

l Ag(s))

18-4 Nernst Equation

Thus far, we have based all of our calculations on the standard cell potential or
standard half-cell potentials—that is, standard state conditions. However, many
times the cell is not at standard conditions—commonly the concentrations are
not 1 M. We may calculate the actual cell potential, Ecell, by using the Nernst
equation:

Ecell

⫽ E⬚

cell–aRT

nF

b ln Q ⫽ E⬚

cell

⫺ a0.0592

n

blog Q    at 25⬚C

R is the ideal gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, n is the number of elec-
trons transferred, F is Faraday’s constant, and Q is the activity quotient. The
second form, involving the log Q, is the more useful form. If you know the cell
reaction,  the  concentrations  of  ions,  and  the  E⬚cell,  then  you  can  calculate  the
actual cell potential. Another useful application of the Nernst equation is in the
calculation  of  the  concentration  of  one  of  the  reactants  from  cell  potential
measurements.  Knowing  the  actual  cell  potential  and  the  E⬚cell,  allows  you  to
calculate Q, the activity quotient. Knowing Q and all but one of the concentra-
tions, allows you to calculate the unknown concentration. Another application
of the Nernst equation is concentration cells. A concentration cell is an elec-
trochemical cell in which the same chemical species are used in both cell com-
partments,  but  differing  in  concentration.  Because  the  half  reactions  are  the
same, the E⬚cell ⫽ 0.00 V. Then simply substituting the appropriate concentra-
tions into the activity quotient allows calculation of the actual cell potential.

When using the Nernst equation on a cell reaction in which the overall reaction
is not supplied, only the half-reactions and concentrations, there are two equiv-
alent methods to work the problem. The ﬁrst way is to write the overall redox
reaction based upon E⬚ values and then apply the Nernst equation. If the Ecell
turns out to be negative, it indicates that the reaction is not a spontaneous one
(an electrolytic cell) or that the reaction is written backwards if it is supposed
to be a galvanic cell. If it is supposed to be a galvanic cell, then all you need to

Electrochemistry

273

do is reverse the overall reaction and change the sign on the Ecell to positive.
The other method involves using the Nernst equation with the individual half-
reactions, then combining them depending on whether or not it is a galvanic
cell.  The  only  disadvantage  to  the  second  method  is  that  you  must  use  the
Nernst equation twice. Either method should lead you to the correct answer.

18-5 Electrolytic Cells 

Electrolytic cells use electricity from an external source to produce a desired
redox reaction. Electroplating and the recharging of an automobile battery are
examples of electrolytic cells.

In the operation of both galvanic and electrolytic cells, there is a reaction occur-
ring on the surface of each electrode. For example, the following reaction takes
place at the cathode of a cell:

Cu2⫹(aq) ⫹ 2 e⫺

l Cu(s)

The rules of stoichiometry also apply in this case. In electrochemical cells, we
must consider not only the stoichiometry related to chemical formulas, but also
the stoichiometry related to electric currents. The half-reaction under consid-
eration not only involves 1 mol of each of the copper species, but also 2 mol of
electrons. We can construct a mole ratio that includes moles of electrons or we
could construct a mole ratio using faradays. A faraday (F) is a mole of elec-
trons. Thus, we could use either of the following ratios for the copper half-reac-
tion:

1 mol Cu2⫹
2 mol ⫺ ⫽ 1 mol Cu2⫹

2 F

274

The SI base unit for electric current is the ampere (A). In addition to being an
SI base unit, an ampere is a coulomb (C) per second, and a faraday is 96485 C/mol

In this reaction the cathode and anode reactions are:

l K

K⫹ ⫹ 1e⫺

l F2 ⫹ 2 e⫺

Electrochemistry

Don’t Forget!

Oxidation is an anode process, even in electrolysis.

275

The cathode reaction comes directly from a table of standard reduction poten-
tials,  while  the  anode  reaction  is  the  reverse  reaction  from  such  a  table.
However, how did we know that it was the ﬂuorine reaction requiring reversal? 

The ﬂuorine half-reaction in the table is:

F2 ⫹ 2 e⫺

l 2 F⫺

If we examine the reactant, we ﬁnd that the compound, KF, is an ionic com-
pound containing potassium ions and ﬂuoride ions. For this reason, we could
replace the KF(l) in the original equation with K⫹(l) ⫹ F⫺(l). These two ions,
either alone or in combination, are the only substances, other than electrons,
that can appear on the reactant side of the half-reactions. One of these ions,
the ﬂuoride ion, appears in the ﬂuorine half-reaction. Since KF, and therefore
F⫺, is a reactant, we must reverse the ﬂuorine half-reaction to place the ﬂuo-
ride  ion  on  the  reactant  side.  The  original  KF  has  no  F2,  so  F2 cannot  be  a
reactant.

What happens if we replace our reactant, KF(l), with KF(aq)? This apparently
minor change makes a big difference in the results. The potassium ions and the
ﬂuoride ions are still present, so they are still under consideration, but we also
need to consider water. Water appears in many places in a table of reduction
potentials. We must examine every place it appears alone on a side or with one
of the ions we know to be present, K⫹ and F⫺. The potassium and ﬂuorine half-
reactions, with their reduction potentials are:

If you reverse the reaction, you must reverse the sign of the cell potential.

Water, the other potential reactant, appears in the following half-reactions:

l H2(g) ⫹ 2 OH⫺(aq)

tant side.

We must narrow the options. There will be only one cathode reaction and only
one anode reaction. How do we pick the correct half-reactions? If one of the
half-reactions were spontaneous (positive), we would pick it for that electrode.
(If more than were spontaneous, we would pick the largest positive value.) All
four half-reactions in this case are nonspontaneous (negative). This is typical
for electrolysis, because you are using electrical energy to force a nonsponta-
neous process to take place.

We  will  begin  with  the  cathode.  The  reaction  that  will  occur  will  be  the  one
requiring the smaller amount of energy. This will be the less negative (higher)
value. We can eliminate all other reduction half-reactions. Therefore, the cath-
ode half-reaction must be:

The same rules apply to the anode. From these rules, we see that the anode
half-reaction must be:

2 H2O(l) l 4 H⫹(aq) ⫹ O2(g) ⫹ 4 e⫺

E⬚ ⫽ ⫺1.23 V

Be Careful!

There is a phenomenon known as overvoltage, which leads to variations in these
rules. The water/oxygen half-reaction, shown here, is often subject to this com-
plication.  If  overvoltage  is  present,  the  oxygen  value  may  become  ⴚ1.40  V
instead of ⴚ1.23 V. Your instructor should let you know if you need to consider
overvoltage.

Once we know the two half-reactions that will occur, we can determine the cell
reaction using the ﬁnal steps for balancing redox equations.

The 4 H⫹(aq) and the 4 OH⫺(aq) become 4 H2O(l):

6 H2O(l) ⫹ 4 e⫺

l 2 H2(g) ⫹ 4 H2O(l) ⫹ O2(g) ⫹ 4 e⫺

We can now cancel to get the ﬁnal balanced equation:

2 H2O(l) l 2 H2(g) ⫹ O2(g)

In an electrolysis process, such as this one, the potassium ions and the ﬂuoride
ions are spectator ions. They must be present for the procedure to work, but
they will remain unchanged.

A redox reaction is a simultaneous reduction (gain of electrons) and oxidation
(loss  of  electrons).  The  oxidizing  agent  is  the  reactant  in  the  reduction  half-
reaction, while the reducing agent is the reactant in the oxidation half-reaction.
Balancing redox reactions involves balancing all the atoms in addition to the
number of electrons lost and gained. Galvanic (voltaic) cells use a redox reac-
tion to produce electricity, while electrolytic cells use electricity to produce a
desired  redox  reaction.  The  anode  is  the  electrode  at  which  oxidation  takes

place, while the cathode is the electrode at which reduction takes place. The cell
notation is a short-hand way of representing an electrochemical cell. The stan-
dard reduction potentials are voltages associated with a reduction half-reaction,
relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). These reduction potentials
may be used to calculate the cell voltage. We can use the Nernst equation to cal-
culate the cell voltage under nonstandard conditions.

Get Started

Our goal in this chapter is to familiarize you with some properties of the ele-
ments, as well as the periodic trends that you can observe in these properties.
You might want to review brieﬂy the periodic trends we discussed in Chapter 8.
We  will  also  discuss  coordination  compounds  and  complex  ions.  Again—
Practice, Practice, Practice.

Don’t Forget!

There are exceptions to every “rule.” Hydrogen is nearly always an exception.

19-1 Hydrogen

Hydrogen is the only nonmetal in Group IA (1) on the periodic table. Some
periodic tables move hydrogen to other places, or list it in more than one place. 

Hydrogen is capable of forming compounds with all elements except the noble
gases.  In  compounds  with  nonmetals,  hydrogen  usually  behaves  like  a  metal
instead of a nonmetal. Therefore, when hydrogen combines with a nonmetal, it
usually has a ⫹1 oxidation number. When hydrogen combines with a metal, it
usually has a ⫺1 oxidation number. Hydrogen compounds with the transition
metals  are  usually  nonstoichiometric.  Nonstoichiometric  compounds  have  no
deﬁnite formula.

All Brønsted-Lowry and Arrhenius acids contain hydrogen. The formation or
transfer of hydrogen ions is the key to the behavior of all acids. You may wish
to review the behavior of acids in Chapters 4 and 15.

The standard cell potential for the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen
gas is, by deﬁnition, 0.00 V. This potential is for the standard hydrogen elec-
trode, SHE, which is the reference to which we compare all other cell poten-
tials. All metals above hydrogen on the Activity Series will displace hydro-
gen gas from acids. (See Chapter 4) Metals below hydrogen will not displace
hydrogen gas.

Chemistry of the Elements

283

19-2 General Properties of Metals

In compounds, metals are cations. That is, they will have a positive charge. The
cations  may  be  shown  with  the  corresponding  anions  in  solution,  or  in  some
particular problems, only the metal cation may be shown. In both of these cases,
you may see designations such as Al3⫹. The metals contained in the leftmost
two columns on the periodic table always form ⫹1 and ⫹2 ions, respectively.
All  other  columns  contain  metals  that  may  adopt  more  than  one  oxidation
state.  Variations  in  oxidation  numbers  are  prevalent  amongst  the  transition
metals. No oxidation number ever exceeds the number at the top of the column
on the periodic table. The highest oxidation number known for any metal in a
compound is ⫹8.

Be Careful!

Metals in their elemental state have no charge. Designations such as Al3⫹ refer
to the metal in, or from, a compound. If you have a piece of metal, you should
use Al, or possibly Al0.

Compounds containing metals must also contain a nonmetal or a polyatomic
anion. There are no compounds found in a general chemistry course where a
compound only contains metals. 

Metals react with nonmetals. These reactions are oxidation-reduction reactions.
(See  Chapters  4  and  18).  Oxidation  of  the  metal  occurs  in  conjunction  with
reduction of the nonmetal. In most cases, only simple compounds will form. For
example, oxygen, O2, reacts with nearly all metals to form oxides (compounds
containing O2⫺). Exceptions are the reaction with sodium where sodium per-
oxide,  Na2O2,  forms  and  the  reaction  with  potassium,  rubidium,  and  cesium
where the superoxides, KO2, RbO2, and CsO2 form.

Metals above hydrogen on the Activity Series will displace hydrogen gas from
acids. When this happens, the metal undergoes oxidation. Metals below hydro-
gen will not release hydrogen from acid solutions.

19-3 Band Theory of Conductivity

Metals conduct electricity through conduction bands. Conduction bands arise
from  the  application  of  Molecular  Orbital  theory  to  multi-atom  systems.
(See Chapter 10.) The bonding molecular orbitals and, sometimes, other molecular

284

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

orbitals merge to produce a valence band. In metals, the valence band is also
the conduction band. Any partially ﬁlled band is a conduction band, providing
a pathway for electron ﬂow. This band is full for the nonmetals. A ﬁlled band
cannot conduct electricity. The metalloids have a ﬁlled valence band and, at a
slightly  higher  energy,  an  empty  conduction  band.  The  separation  between
these two bands is the band gap. A relatively small input of energy can move
electrons  from  the  ﬁlled  valence  band  to  the  empty  conduction  band.  When
electrons enter the conduction band, it becomes partially ﬁlled, and electrical
conductivity is possible.

19-4 Periodic Trends in Metallic

Properties

Metals follow the general trends of atomic radii, ionization energy, and electron
afﬁnity. Radii increase to the left in any row and down any column on the peri-
odic table. Ionization energies and electron afﬁnities increase up any column
and towards the right in any row on the periodic table. Electron afﬁnities are
not  very  important  for  the  metals  because  they  normally  form  cations.
Variations appear whenever the metal has a half-ﬁlled or ﬁlled subshell of elec-
trons.  The  electronegativity  values  for  the  representative  metals  increase
towards the top of any column and towards the right on the periodic table. For
the transition metals, the electronegativity peaks at gold.

The metallic properties increase down any column and towards the left in any
row on the periodic table. One important metallic property is that metal oxides
are base anhydrides. A base anhydride will produce a base in water. These are
not  oxidation-reduction  reactions.  Many  metal  oxides  are  too  insoluble  for
them to produce any signiﬁcant amount of base. However, most metal oxides,
even those that are not soluble in water, will behave as bases to acids. A few
metal  oxides,  and  their  hydroxides,  are  amphoteric.  Amphoteric  means  they
may behave either as a base or as an acid. Amphoterism is important for alu-
minum, beryllium, and zinc. Complications occur whenever the oxidation num-
ber of the metal exceeds ⫹4 as in the oxides that tend to be acidic.

19-5 General Properties of Nonmetals

In a compound containing a metal and a nonmetal, the nonmetal is an anion.
The anionic charge of a nonmetal is predictable from the position of the non-
metal on the periodic table. You begin on the far right and count towards the
left until you get to the column containing the nonmetal of interest. The noble

Chemistry of the Elements

285

gases do not form anions and this method leaves them with a zero oxidation
number. The next column to the left, the halogens, is ⫺1; then comes ⫺2, fol-
lowed  by  ⫺3,  and  ﬁnally  ⫺4.  (Remember  these  are  oxidation  numbers;  you
should not expect to obtain isolated ions such as C4⫺.) In compounds, ﬂuorine
has only a ⫺1 oxidation number. The anionic charge determined by this proce-
dure is the lowest possible oxidation number for the nonmetal. 

Be Careful!

Even though ﬂuorine only exists in compounds in the ⫺1 oxidation state, it, like
all elements, has a zero oxidation state in the elemental form. This means that
ﬂuorine is ⫺1 in CaF2, PbF2, SF4, and ClF3, and 0 in F2.

All nonmetals except ﬂuorine and the lighter noble gases (He, Ne, and Ar) can
form compounds where the nonmetal has a positive oxidation number. A non-
metal can only adopt a positive oxidation number if there is a more electroneg-
ative nonmetal present. The maximum oxidation number of a nonmetal is related
to the position of the nonmetal on the periodic table. Using the older system
(Roman numerals), the maximum oxidation is equal to the Roman numeral for
the column. Using the newer system, the maximum is the group number ⫺10.
Xenon exhibits the highest observed oxidation number for a nonmetal. Xenon
is ⫹8 in XeO4.

A nonmetal may adopt any oxidation number between the values predicted in
the preceding two paragraphs. The only exceptions are ﬂuorine, which is only
⫺1 in compounds, and helium, neon, and argon, which have no known com-
pounds.  When  there  is  a  choice  of  oxidation  states,  there  must  be  additional
information available in order to allow you to choose the correct state.

19-6 Periodic Trends of Nonmetals

Nonmetals  follow  the  general  trends  of  atomic  radii,  ionization  energy,  and
electron afﬁnity. Radii increase to the left in any row and down any column on
the periodic table. Ionization energies and electron afﬁnities increase up any
column and towards the right in any row on the periodic table. The noble gases
do not have electron afﬁnity values. Ionization energies are not very important for
the nonmetals because they normally form anions. Variations appear whenever
the nonmetal has a half-ﬁlled or ﬁlled subshell of electrons. The electronegativity

286

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

values for the nonmetals increase toward the top of any column and towards
the right on the periodic table. Fluorine has the highest electronegativity. The
noble gases do not have an electronegativity value.

Chemically,  nonmetals  are  usually  the  opposite  of  metals.  The  nonmetallic
nature will increase towards the top of any column and toward the right in any
row  on  the  periodic  table.  Most  nonmetal  oxides  are  acid  anhydrides.  When
added to water, they will form acids. A few nonmetals oxides, most notably CO
and NO, do not react. Nonmetal oxides that do not react are neutral oxides.
The reaction of a nonmetal oxide with water is not an oxidation-reduction reac-
tion. The acid that forms will have the nonmetal in the same oxidation state as
in the reacting oxide. The main exception to this is NO2, which undergoes an
oxidation-reduction (disproportionation) reaction to produce HNO3 and NO.
When a nonmetal can form more than one oxide, the higher the oxidation num-
ber of the nonmetal, the stronger the acid it forms.

19-7 Properties of the Transition Metals

The most confusing property of the transition metals is that nearly every transi-
tion metal can adopt more than one oxidation state. In most cases, the range of
oxidation states is from ⫹2 to the group number if you use the older system of
assigning group numbers with Roman numerals. The maximum oxidation num-
ber in the ﬁrst transition series is ⫹7 (manganese), while the highest in the sec-
ond and third transition series is ⫹8 (ruthenium and osmium). For all three series,
you should expect the upper limit to increase to the maximum for the series and
then start decreasing. The only ⫹1 oxidation states are in column IB (11) where
the three metals, copper, silver, and gold, may adopt this state. The ⫹1 state is the
most stable state for silver. Zinc and cadmium use only the ⫹2 oxidation state.
2⫹, is a special case because it is a polyatomic ion. Since
The mercury(I) ion, Hg2
there are multiple oxidation states available, you must have additional informa-
tion in the problem or chapter in order to know which one you should choose.
Compounds or ions with the metal in an oxidation state above ⫹5 are strong oxi-
dizing agents. The ions Ti3⫹, V2⫹, Cr2⫹, and Fe2⫹ are reducing agents.

19-8 Coordination Compounds:

Crystal Field Theory

In addition to the ability of transition metals to adopt a variety of oxidation states,
they have the ability to form coordination compounds. Coordination compounds
contain complex ions. The ability to form a complex ion is not restricted to transi-
tion metals; however, most examples you will see involve a transition metal.

Chemistry of the Elements

287

A complex ion will have a central atom, normally a transition metal, with one
or more ligands. A ligand is a Lewis base that reacts with the central atom. The
most common numbers of ligands are four and six. If a species does not contain
a lone pair of electrons, it cannot be a Lewis base, which means it cannot be a
ligand. Some ligands are chelating ligand. A chelating ligand behaves as a Lewis
base more than once to the same central atom. An example of a chelating lig-
and is ethylenediamine, NH2CH2CH2NH2. This molecule donates a pair of elec-
trons from each of the nitrogen atoms. Three ethylenediamine ligands count the
same as six “normal” ligands. Another common chelating ligand that behaves
2⫺. The ligand ethylenediaminete-
like ethylenediamine is the oxalate ion, C2O4
traacetate, EDTA4⫺, chelates by donating six electron pairs. The six electron
pairs make this ligand equivalent to six “normal” ligands.

Crystal Field theory allows predictions concerning the behavior of complexes.
When six ligands are present, the complex formed is usually octahedral. If there
are  four  ligands  present,  the  complex  formed  may  be  either  tetrahedral  or
square planar. Each of these three geometries has a characteristic splitting of
the d-orbitals predicted by Crystal Field theory. Your textbook will have dia-
grams of these characteristic patterns. The steps in utilizing these patterns begin
with determining the number of ligands. If the number is four, there must be
additional information available in order for you to determine if the complex is
tetrahedral or square planar. Once you have the appropriate pattern you should
enter the d-electrons from the metal into the pattern. If there is an option on
how to do this, there must be additional information in the problem.

Don’t Forget!

When a transition metal forms a cation; it is the s-electrons that leave ﬁrst. Thus,
iron is [Ar]4s23d6, and Fe2⫹ is [Ar]3d6, and Fe3⫹ is [Ar]3d5.

19-9 Utterly Confused About Complex Ions

The general equation for the formation of a complex is:

M ⫹ x L K [M Lx]

The equilibrium constant expression, Kf, is 

Kf ⫽

[M Lx]
[M] [L]x

288

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

In order to do a problem involving the formation of a complex ion requires you
to know the value of x. While x is usually either 4 or 6, it can have other values.
How can you tell what x is? You must have additional information. Your instruc-
tor or textbook may tell you directly what x will be. In other cases, you may need
to examine a table of formation constants, Kf. If you see, for example, Kf for
[Fe(C2O4)3]3⫺ is equal to some value, the subscript “3” tells you that x ⫽ 3.

To change the general equation to a speciﬁc equation entails a simple substitu-
tion of the formulas. Using [Fe(C2O4)3]3⫺ as an example, we see that M ⫽ Fe3⫹
and L ⫽ C2O4

2⫺, to give the equation:

Fe3⫹(aq) ⫹ 3 C2O4

2⫺(aq) K [Fe(C2O4)3]3⫺(aq)

This leads to the following equilibrium constant expression:

Kf ⫽

[Fe(C2O4)3⫺
3 ]
2⫺]3
[Fe3⫹] [C2O4

Be Careful!

Make sure you move the ion charges inside the bracket so they are not mistaken
for exponents.

Once you have the correct equilibrium constant expression, there is no differ-
ence in solving the complex ion equilibrium than any other equilibrium problem.

In considering the properties of the elements, hydrogen is usually an exception.
It can form compounds with both metals and nonmetals. Metals react with non-
metals  to  form  cations.  Metals  conduct  electricity  through  conduction  bands,
partially ﬁlled bands described by the application of Molecular Orbital theory
to multi-atom systems. Metals follow the general periodic trends in properties.
Nonmetals form anions when reacting with metals. Nonmetals also follow the
general periodic trends. Transition metals may adopt more than one oxidation
state.  Transition  metals  may  also  form  coordination  compounds.  The  groups
attached to the transition metal are ligands.

Our goal in this chapter is to help you learn about nuclear reactions, including
nuclear  decay  as  well  as  ﬁssion  and  fusion.  If  needed,  review  the  section  in
Chapter 2 on isotopes and the section in Chapter 13 on integrated rate laws
which discusses ﬁrst-order kinetics. And just like the previous nineteen chapters,

20-1 Nuclear Reactions 

Most nuclear reactions involve the breaking apart of the nucleus into two or
more different elements or subatomic particles. If we know all but one of the
particles,  then  the  unknown  particle  can  be  determined  by  balancing  the
nuclear equation. When chemical equations are balanced, we add coefﬁcients
to ensure that there are the same number of each type of atom on both the left
and right of the reaction arrow. However, in order to balance nuclear equations
we ensure that there is the same sum of both mass numbers and atomic num-
bers on the left and right of the reaction arrow. Recall that we can represent a
speciﬁc isotope of an element by the following symbolization:

ZX
A

A is the mass number (sum of protons and neutrons), Z is the atomic number
(number of protons), and X is the element symbol (from the periodic table). In
balancing nuclear reactions, ensure that the sum of all A values on the left of
the reaction arrow equals the sum of all A values to the right of the arrow. The
same will be true of the sums of the atomic numbers, Z. Knowing that these
sums have to be equal allows you to predict the mass and atomic number of an
unknown particle, if we know all the others.

If we bombard chlorine-35 with a neutron, we create hydrogen-1 along with an
isotope of a different element. Write a balanced nuclear reaction for this process.

Solution:

First, we write a partial nuclear equation:

The sum of the mass numbers on the left of the equation is 36 (35 ⫹ 1) and on
the right is 1 ⫹ x. The mass number of the unknown isotope must be 35. The
sum of the atomic numbers on the left is 17 (17 ⫹ 0) and 1 ⫹ y on the right. The
atomic number of the unknown must then be 16. This atomic number identiﬁes
the element as sulfur, so that we can write a complete nuclear equation:

Sulfur-35 does not occur in nature; it is an artiﬁcial or man-made isotope. 

We  can  observe  three  common  types  of  radioactive  decay  in  nature.  We  can
occasionally observe others.

Alpha Emission
An alpha particle is essentially a helium nucleus with two protons and two neu-
trons. It is represented as 
. As this particle leaves the decaying nucleus
it has no electrons and thus has a 2⫹ charge. However, it quickly acquires two
electrons from the surroundings to form the neutral atom. Most commonly, we
show the alpha particle as the neutral particle and not the cation.

Gamma Emission
Gamma  emission  is  the  release  of  high-energy,  short-wavelength  photons,
which are similar to x-rays. The representation of this radiation is g. Gamma
emission commonly accompanies most other types of radioactive decay, but we
normally do not show it in the balanced nuclear equation since it has neither
appreciable mass nor charge.

Alpha, beta, and gamma emission are the most common types of natural decay
modes, but we do occasionally observe positron emission and electron capture.

Positron Emission
A positron is essentially an electron that has a positive charge instead of a neg-
ative one. It is represented as 
. Positron emission results from the con-
version of a proton to a neutron and a positron:

Electron Capture
The four decay modes described above all involve emission or giving off a par-
ticle, but electron capture is the capturing of an electron from the energy level
closest to the nucleus (1s) by a proton in the nucleus. This creates a neutron:

However, this leaves a vacancy in the 1s energy level and an electron, from a
higher energy level, drops down to ﬁll this vacancy. A cascading effect occurs as
the electrons shift downward releasing energy. This released energy falls in the
x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These x-rays give scientists a clue
that electron capture has taken place.

Electron capture is the only decay process we presented where you add a parti-
cle on the left side of the reaction arrow.

20-2 Nuclear Stability

Sometimes it is difﬁcult to predict if a particular isotope is stable and, if unsta-
ble, what type of decay mode it might undergo. All isotopes that contain 84 or
more protons are unstable. These unstable isotopes will undergo nuclear decay.
For  these  large  massive  isotopes,  we  observe  alpha  decay  most  commonly.
Alpha decay gets rid of four units of mass and two units of charge, thus helping
to relieve the repulsive stress found in the nucleus of these isotopes. For other
isotopes of atomic number less than 83, we can best predict stability by the use
of the neutron to proton (n/p) ratio.

A plot of the # neutrons (n) versus the # protons (p) for the known stable iso-
topes gives the nuclear belt of stability. (See your textbook for a ﬁgure of the
belt of stability.) At the low end of this belt of stability (Z < 20), the n/p ratio is 1.
At the high end (Z 
80), the n/p ratio is about 1.5. We can then use the n/p
ratio of the isotope to predict if it will be stable. If it is unstable, then the iso-
tope will utilize a decay mode that will bring it back onto the belt of stability.

<

Consider neon-18 or Ne-18. It has 10p and 8n, giving an n/p ratio of 0.8. For a
light isotope, like this one, this value is low. A low value indicates that this iso-
tope will probably be unstable. Neutron-poor isotopes, meaning that it has a
low n/p ratio do not have enough neutrons (or has too many protons) to be sta-
ble.  Decay  modes  that  increase  the  number  of  neutrons  and/or  decrease  the
number of protons are favorable. Both positron emission and electron capture
accomplish this by converting a proton into a neutron. As a rule, positron emis-
sion occurs with lighter isotopes and electron capture with heavier ones.

Isotopes that are neutron-rich, that have too many neutrons or not enough pro-
tons, lie above the belt of stability and tend to undergo beta emission because
that decay mode converts a neutron into a proton.

A particular isotope may undergo a series of nuclear decays until ﬁnally a sta-
ble isotope forms. For example, radioactive U-238 decays to stable Pb-206 in
14 steps, half of these are alpha emissions and the other half are beta emissions.

20-3 Half-Lives (t1/2) 

A radioactive isotope may be unstable, but it is impossible to predict when a
certain atom will decay. However, if we have a statistically large enough sample,
some trends become obvious. The radioactive decay follows ﬁrst-order kinetics
(see Chapter 13 for a more in-depth discussion of ﬁrst-order reactions). If we
monitor the number of radioactive atoms in a sample, we observe that it takes
a certain amount of time for half the sample to decay; it takes the same amount
of time for half the remaining sample to decay, and so on. The amount of time
it takes for half the sample to decay is the half-life of the isotope and has the
symbol  t1/2.  The  table  below  shows  the  percentage  of  the  radioactive  isotope
remaining versus half-life.

Half-lives may be very short, 4.2 ⫻ 10⫺6 seconds for Po-213, or very long, 4.5 ⫻
109 years for U-238. 

If only multiples of half-lives are considered, the calculations are very straight-
forward.

Iodine-131 is useful in the treatment of thyroid cancer and has a t1/2 of 8 days.
How long would it take to decay to 25% of its original amount? 

Solution:

Looking at the chart, you can see that 25% would be at 2 half-lives or 16 days. 

Since radioactive decay is not a linear process, you cannot use the chart to pre-
dict how much would still be radioactive at the end of some time (or amount)

that is not associated with a multiple of a half-life. To solve these types of prob-
lems, one must use the mathematical relationships associated with ﬁrst-order
kinetics. In general, two equations from Chapter 13 are useful:

(1) ln (Nt/N0) ⫽ ⫺kt

and (2) t1/2 ⫽ (ln 2)/k or

t1/2 ⫽ 0.693/k

In  these  equations,  ln  is  the  natural  logarithm,  Nt is  the  amount  of  isotope
radioactive at some time t, N0 was the amount of isotope radioactive initially,
and k is the rate constant for the decay. If you know initial and ﬁnal amounts
and if you are looking for the half-life, you would use equation (1) to solve for
the rate constant and then use equation (2) to solve for t1/2.

What is the half-life of a radioisotope that takes 15 min to decay to 90% of its
original activity?

Solution:

Using equation (1): 

ln (90/100) ⫽ ⫺k (15 min)

Now equation (2):

⫺0.1054 ⫽ ⫺k (15 min)

7.03 ⫻ 10⫺3 min⫺1 ⫽ k (unrounded)

t1/2 ⫽ ln 2/7.03 ⫻ 10⫺3 min⫺1
t1/2 ⫽ 0.693/7.03 ⫻ 10⫺3 min⫺1
t1/2 ⫽ 98.5775 ⫽ 99 min

If one knows the half-life and amount remaining radioactive, you can then use
equation (2) to calculate the rate constant, k, and then use equation (1) to solve
for  the  time.  This  is  the  basis  of  carbon-14  dating.  Scientists  use  carbon-14
dating to determine the age of objects that were once alive.

Suppose we discover a wooden tool and we determine its carbon-14 activity to
have decreased to 65% of the original. How old is the object?

Solution:

The half-life of C-14 is 5730 years. Substituting this into equation (2):

5730 y ⫽ (ln 2)/k

5730 y ⫽ 0.693/k

20-4 Mass/Energy Conversions

Whenever  a  nuclear  decay  or  reaction  takes  place,  it  releases  energy.  This
energy may be in the form of heat and light, gamma radiation, or kinetic energy
of the expelled particle and recoil of the remaining particle. This energy results
from the conversion of a very small amount of matter into energy. 

Don’t Forget!

In a nuclear reaction, there is no conservation of matter as in ordinary chemical
reactions.

The amount of energy that is produced can be calculated by using Einstein’s
relationship, E ⫽ mc2, where E is the energy produced, m is the mass converted
into energy (the mass defect) and c is the speed of light. The amount of matter
converted into energy is normally very small, but when we multiply it by the
speed of light (a very large number) squared, the amount of energy produced is
very large.

When 1 mol of U-238 decays to Th-234, 5 ⫻ 10⫺6 kg of matter is converted to
energy (the mass defect). Calculate the amount of energy released.

Solution:

E ⫽ mc2

E ⫽ (5 ⫻ 10⫺6 kg) (3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s)2

E ⫽ 4.5 ⫻ 1011 kg⭈m2/s2 ⫽ 5 ⫻ 1011 kg⭈m2/s2 ⫽ 5 ⫻ 1011 J

If you want to calculate the energy in joules, the mass must be in units of kilo-
grams. A joule is a kg⭈m2/s2.

20-5 Fission and Fusion 

Nuclear ﬁssion is the breakdown of a nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei
with the release of energy. The most useful ﬁssion process involves the decay of
U-235 when hit by a neutron:

0n ⫹ 235
1

92U

l

56Ba ⫹ 91
142

36Kr ⫹ 3 1
0n

Notice that the reaction consumes one neutron, but the reaction releases three
neutrons. Those three neutrons are then free to initiate additional ﬁssion reac-
tions. This type of situation in which there is a multiplier effect is a chain reac-
tion. We can use isotopes that undergo chain reaction in both the production of
bombs and in nuclear power plants. U-235 is ﬁssionable, but U-238 is not. There
is a certain minimum quantity of ﬁssionable matter needed to support a chain
reaction, the critical mass.

Nuclear  reactors  are  useful  in  the  production  of  electricity,  but  they  are  not
without  their  problems.  These  problems  include  disposal  of  nuclear  wastes,
accidents, and sabotage. The eventual answer may lie in nuclear fusion.

Fusion is the combining of lighter nuclei into a heavier one. Such reactions can
release a great deal of energy. Isotopes of hydrogen fuse into helium and power
the sun. For the past few decades, scientists have been investigating the fusion
process as a way of providing the world with energy. One of the more promis-
ing fusion reactions is:

1H ⫹ 3
2

1H

l

2He ⫹ 1
4
0n

In this reaction, two isotopes of hydrogen fuse into helium and a neutron. Three
major problems in this reaction have arisen—time, temperature, and contain-
ment. The nuclei must be held together long enough (~1 s) at high enough tem-
peratures to provide the activation energy for the reaction (~40,000,000 K). At
this temperature, every substance is a gas or plasma so containment is proving
to be the biggest obstacle. Scientists are conducting major investigations into the

300

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

use of magnetic ﬁelds (“magnetic bottles”) to contain the nuclei at this temper-
ature. If they can overcome these obstacles, fusion may well provide a limitless
energy  source  for  our  world.  The  production  of  neutrons  by  this  process  is  a
problem. It is difﬁcult to keep a neutron in a magnetic bottle. Escaping neutrons
will convert some of the material in the fusion plant into radioactive wastes.

20-6 Utterly Confused About

Nuclear Decay

Nuclear decay problems normally use one or both of the following equations:

(1) ln (Nt/N0) ⫽ ⫺kt

and (2) t1/2 ⫽ (ln 2)/k or

t1/2 ⫽ 0.693/k

The terms Nt and N0 may have many different units. The only restriction on the
units is that these two terms have the same units. If they do not have the same
units, you will need to convert one of the units. Both t and t1/2 will have units of
time. Any time unit may be present. The rate constant (decay constant), k, will
have units of time⫺1. Any time unit may be present. The time units for t, t1/2, and
k must agree. If the units do not agree, you will need to make a conversion.

Let’s look at some sample questions.

known and unknown variables:

Nuclear reactions involve the decay of an unstable isotope to a more stable one.
The natural decay modes include alpha emission, beta emission, gamma emis-
sion, positron emission, and electron capture. By considering the ratio of neu-
trons to protons in a particular isotope, we may be able to predict whether a
certain isotope is stable and its possible decay modes. The half-life (t1/2) is the
amount of time that it takes for one-half of a sample of a radioactive isotope to
decay. This decay follows ﬁrst-order kinetics. Using the equations derived for
ﬁrst-order  kinetics  allows  us  to  calculate  time,  half-life  or  amount.  Einstein’s
equation allows us to calculate the amount of energy released when a certain
amount of matter is converted to energy. Practical applications of nuclear decay
include ﬁssion, the decay of a larger isotope into two or more smaller ones, and
fusion, the combining of lighter isotopes into a heavier one. Fission is currently
used  in  nuclear  power  generators  and  atomic  bombs.  Fusion  may  eventually
provide an unlimited power source.

Our goal in this chapter is to help you learn about organic chemistry, the chemistry
of carbon. You will learn about the different types of organic compounds. We will
also  discuss  biochemistry,  including  some  biologically  important  compounds,
such as proteins, carbohydrates, and so on. We will also familiarize you with some
organic reactions. And ﬁnally, to do well, you must Practice, Practice, Practice.

21-1 Organic Compounds

Organic chemistry is the study of the chemistry of carbon. We classify almost all
of the compounds containing carbon as organic compounds. We consider only
a few, such as carbonates, cyanides, etc, as inorganic. Scientists once believed
that only living organisms could produce organic compounds. However, in 1828,
the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler showed this to be incorrect when he pro-
duced the ﬁrst organic compound from inorganic starting materials. From that
time, chemists have synthesized many organic compounds found in nature and
have made many never found naturally. Carbon is capable of strongly bonding
to itself and other elements. There appears to be no limit to how many carbon
atoms  can  bond  together.  These  factors  allow  carbon  to  form  long,  complex
chains and rings.

21-2 Hydrocarbons and Nomenclature

Quick Tip

Carbon forms four bonds.

Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds are members of a family of
organic compounds called hydrocarbons, compounds of carbon and hydrogen.
These hydrocarbons are the simplest of organic compounds, but are extremely
important to our society as fuels and raw materials for chemical industries. We

Organic, Biochemistry, and Polymers

307

heat our homes and run our automobiles through the combustion (burning) of
these hydrocarbons. 

Alkanes are hydrocarbons that contain only single covalent bonds within the
molecule. They are saturated hydrocarbons since the carbon atoms bond to the
maximum  number  of  other  atoms.  These  alkanes  may  be  straight-chained
hydrocarbons, in which the carbons are sequentially bonded, branched hydro-
carbons  in  which  another  hydrocarbon  group  is  bonded  to  the  hydrocarbon
“backbone,”  or  they  may  be  cyclic  in  which  the  hydrocarbon  is  composed
entirely or partially of a ring system. The straight-chained and branched hydro-
carbons have the general formula of CnH2n⫹2 while the cyclic hydrocarbons will
have  the  general  formula  of  CnH2n.  The  n  stands  for  the  number  of  carbon
atoms in the compound. The ﬁrst ten straight-chained hydrocarbons are:

There can be many more carbon units in a chain than are shown in Table 21-1,
but those are enough to allow us to study a little alkane nomenclature, the nam-
ing of alkanes.

The  naming  of  alkanes  relies  upon  choosing  the  longest  carbon  chain  in  the
structural formula. Then name the hydrocarbon branches with a number indi-
cating to which carbon atom the branch is attached. Here are the speciﬁc rules
for naming simple alkanes:

1. Find the continuous carbon chain in the compound that contains the most

carbon atoms. This will be the base name of the alkane.

2. You will modify this base name by adding the names of the branches (sub-
stituent group) in front of the base name. We name alkane branches by

308

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

taking  the  name  of  the  alkane  that  contains  the  same  number  of  carbon
atoms,  dropping  the  -ane  ending  and  adding  -yl.  Methane  would  then
become methyl; propane becomes propyl, and so on. If there is more than
one branch, list them alphabetically.

3. A location number is necessary to indicate the point of attachment of a par-
ticular  substituent.  We  assign  these  numbers  by  consecutively  numbering
the carbons of the base hydrocarbon starting at one end of the hydrocarbon
chain. Choose the end so that there will be the lowest sum of location num-
bers for the substituent groups. Place this location number in front of the
substituent name and separate it from the name by a hyphen (i.e., 2-methyl).
4. Place the substituent names with their location numbers in front of the base
name of the alkane in alphabetical order. If there are identical substituents
(e.g., 2 methyl groups), then give the location numbers of each, separated by
commas using the common Greek preﬁxes (such as, di-, tri-, and tetra-.) to
indicate the number of identical substituent groups (i.e., 2,3-dimethyl). Do
not use these Greek preﬁxes in the alphabetical arrangement.

5. The last substituent group becomes a part of the base name as a preﬁx.

Compounds that have the same molecular formulas, but different structural for-
mulas, are isomers. When dealing with hydrocarbons, this amounts to a different
arrangement of the carbon atoms. Isomers such as these are structural isomers. 

Don’t Forget!

In writing structural isomers as well as any organic compound, remember that
carbon forms four bonds!! One of the most common mistakes that a chemistry
student makes is writing an organic structure with a carbon atom having less or
more than four bonds. 

Name the following compound:

Answer: 5-ethyl-2,2-dimethylnonane

Solution:

First, pick the longest chain. This is bold-faced in this example. Since only sin-
gle bonds are present between the carbon atoms, this is an alkane. Since the
longest chain has 9 carbons, this is a nonane.

Quick Tip

In  the  structure  above,  we  could  have  chosen  either  of  the  other  two  ⫺CH3
groups to be the ﬁrst carbon on the left-hand side.

Next,  number  the  longest  chain  from  one  end  to  the  other  with  the  lowest
number(s) going to the branches. For the above example the numbering of
the chain (boldface carbon atoms) would be:

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

Once you have assigned these numbers, do not alter them later.

All carbon atoms that are not part of the nine atom main chain are branches.
Branches have -yl endings. It may help you to circle the carbon atoms belong-
ing in the branches. In the above example, there are three branches. Two con-
sist of only one carbon and are methyl groups. The remaining branch has two
carbons, so it is an ethyl group. We arrange the branches alphabetically. If there
is more than one of a particular type use a preﬁx (such as di-, tri-,and tetra-.).
The  two  methyl  groups  are  designated  dimethyl.  We  indicate  the  position  of
each  branch  with  a  number  already  determined  from  the  main  chain.  Each
branch must get its own number even if it is identical to one already used.

310

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

In the above example this gives: 5-ethyl-2,2-dimethylnonane

a. ethyl before methyl (alphabetical preﬁxes are ignored)
b. two methyl groups = dimethyl
c. three branches = three numbers

We separate numbers from other numbers by commas, and we separate num-
bers from letters by a dash.

Alkenes  are  hydrocarbons  that  have  at  least  one  carbon-to-carbon  double
bond,  while  alkynes  have  a  carbon-to-carbon  triple  bond.  Alkenes  have  the
general formula of CnH2n while the alkynes have the general formula of CnH2n⫺2.
Cyclic  alkenes  and  alkynes  would  have  two  less  hydrogen  atoms.  Aromatic
hydrocarbons are usually ring systems of alternating double and single bonds.
Benzene,  C6H6,  is  a  very  common  aromatic  hydrocarbon.  The  presence  of  a
double or triple bond make these hydrocarbons unsaturated, that is they do not
have the maximum number of bonds to other atoms.

Benzene, C6H6, is the best-known aromatic compound. It consists of a ring of
six carbon atoms. One way of representing the structure is to alternate single
and double bonds about the ring as shown in the leftmost diagram in the fol-
lowing  ﬁgure.  The  center  structure  is  a  resonance  form  of  the  ﬁrst  structure.
The presence of resonance stabilizes the structure by delocalizing the electrons.
Resonance makes all the carbon-carbon bonds equal instead of some single and
some double. The structure at the far right in the following diagram is a com-
mon  representation  of  benzene  to  indicate  the  presence  of  resonance  along
with the equality of all carbon-carbon bonds.

The nomenclature of alkenes and alkynes is very similar to that of the alkanes
with two major differences. (1) The longest carbon chain must contain the dou-
ble  or  triple  bond  and  number  the  chain  from  the  end  closest  to  the
double/triple bond. A number indicates the position of the double/triple bond.

Organic, Biochemistry, and Polymers

311

This number indicates the number of the ﬁrst carbon atom that is part of the
double/triple bond. (2) The name of longest carbon chain is formed by taking
the alkane name, dropping the –ane sufﬁx and replace it by –ene for an alkene
or –yne for an alkyne.

21-3 Functional Groups 

If  chemistry  students  had  to  learn  the  properties  of  each  of  the  millions  of
organic compounds, it would be an impossible task. However, chemists ﬁnd that
having certain arrangements of atoms in an organic molecule causes those mol-
ecules to react in a similar fashion. For example, methyl alcohol, CH3[OH,
and ethyl alcohol, CH3[CH2[OH, undergo the same types of reaction. The
[OH group is the reactive part of these types of molecules. These reactive
groups are functional groups. Instead of learning the properties of individual
molecules, we can simply learn the properties of functional groups. 

In our study of the simple hydrocarbons, there are only two functional groups.
One is a carbon-to-carbon double bond. Hydrocarbons that contain a carbon-
to-carbon double bond are alkenes. The other hydrocarbon functional group
is  a  carbon-to-carbon  triple  bond.  Hydrocarbons  that  contain  a  triple  bond
are alkynes. These functional groups are the reactive sites in the alkenes and
alkynes.  The  result  is  that  alkenes  and  alkynes  are  more  reactive  than  the
alkanes.

The introduction of other atoms (such as N, O, and Cl.) to the organic com-
pounds gives rise to many other functional groups. The most common func-
tional  groups  are  in  Table  21-2.  These  functional  groups  normally  are  the
reactive sites in the molecules.

21-4 Polymers

Polymers are  large,  high  molecular  weight  compounds  formed  by  linking
together  many  smaller  compounds  called  monomers.  The  properties  of  the
polymer are dependent on the monomer units used and the way in which they
link together. Many polymers occur in nature such as cellulose, starch, cotton,
wool, and rubber. Others are created synthetically, such as nylon, PVC, poly-
styrene, Teﬂon, and polyester.

TABLE 21-2 Common Organic Functional Groups

The polymerization of chloroethylene, CH2CHCl, takes place by the splitting of
one of the bonds of the double bond to form a highly reactive carbon contain-
ing a single electron at either end of the molecule.

21-5 Proteins

Proteins are  naturally  occurring  organic  polymers  that  are  composed  of
monomer  units  called  amino  acids.  Amino  acids  contain  a  carbon  atom  with
two functional groups, an amino group, ([NH2), and a carboxylic acid group,
([COOH) attached. This central carbon atom also has a hydrogen atom and
another  organic  group,  an  “R”  group,  attached.  The  identity  of  the  R  group
determines the identity of the amino acid.

314

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The amino acids link together by the reaction of an amino group of one amino
acid  with  the  carboxylic  acid  group  of  another  amino  acid.  This  forms  a
peptide bond. (For the sake of clarity the ⫹ signs in the reaction have been omit-
ted.) A peptide bond is an amide group in molecules that are not biochemi-
cal. Many functional groups have different names in organic chemistry and in
biochemistry.

There are 20 amino acids found in the human body that are involved in protein
synthesis.  Refer  to  your  textbook  for  a  table  of  the  20  amino  acids.  The
sequence of the amino acids dictates the properties of a protein. Examples of
proteins include keratin in hair, hemoglobin, insulin, antibodies, and enzymes.

21-6 Carbohydrates 

Carbohydrates are made entirely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The sim-
plest  class  of  carbohydrates  is  the  monosaccharides.  Glucose,  C6H12O6,  is  an
example  of  a  monosaccharide.  We  can  make  a  disaccharide  by  joining  two
monosaccharides. Examples of disaccharides include sucrose, and lactose. We
can make a polysaccharide, such as starch or cellulose, by joining large numbers
of monosaccharide units together. 

The monosaccharides have a couple of characteristics that prove to be impor-
tant in terms of their structure and function. They all have at least one carbon
that is bonded to four different groups (a chiral carbon), and most form ﬁve-
and  six-membered  rings  easily.  The  presence  of  chiral  carbons  allows  these
compounds to exist as two different optical isomers that are nonsuperimposable
mirror images of each other. (Your feet are nonsuperimposable mirror images.
Try putting a left shoe on a right foot!) 

Glucose may form a chain type structure such as the one pictured below. All of
the carbon atoms except the one at the top and the one at the bottom are chi-
ral. The four different groups making the fourth carbon chiral are outlined.

In solution, the chain structure of glucose is in equilibrium with two different
ring forms of glucose. The two different ring structures of glucose are a-glucose
and b-glucose. These two forms differ in the position of an [OH group rela-
tive to the carbon at the far right side of the ring.

Polysaccharides formed using these two different types of glucose will have dif-
ferent properties. Joining units of b-glucose, results in the formation of cellulose.
However, if we join units of a-glucose the result is starch. A minor difference in
structural linkage makes the difference between a tree and a potato.

21-7 Nucleic Acids 

Nucleic acids are the molecules in our cells that direct and store information for
reproduction and cellular growth. There are two types of nucleic acids: ribonu-
cleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Both of these nucleic acids
are  unbranched  organic  polymers  composed  of  monomer  units  called
nucleotides. These nucleotides are composed of a sugar molecule, a nitrogen
base, and phosphoric acid. A single DNA molecule may contain several million
of  these  nucleotides,  while  the  smaller  RNA  molecules  may  contain  several
thousand.

316

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The DNA carries the genetic information for the cells. Sections of a DNA mol-
ecule called genes contain the information to make a particular protein. DNA
serves two main functions. Molecules of DNA can produce other DNA mole-
cules and RNA molecules. RNA molecules are directly responsible for the syn-
thesis of proteins.

21-8 Utterly Confused About Organic

Reactions problems

There are far too many organic reactions for us to discuss all of them here. We will
concentrate on a few important types, and give some guidelines on what to look for
in  other  cases.  In  most  cases,  the  key  to  any  organic  reaction  is  what  functional
group(s) is/are present. Typically, the functional groups will change and nothing else.
A functional group is anything other than a C[C single bond or a C[H bond. 

All  organic  compounds  will  undergo  combustion  reactions.  That  is  they  will
combine with oxygen gas, O2, to produce carbon dioxide, CO2, and water, H2O.
Nitrogen  will  yield  nitrogen  gas,  N2.  Most  of  the  halogens  will  produce  the
appropriate hydrogen halide. For example, chlorine, Cl, gives hydrogen chlo-
ride, HCl. The other elements usually give their oxides.

Quick Tip

If combustion occurs with a slight deﬁciency of oxygen then carbon monoxide,
CO, may form instead of carbon dioxide, CO2. A severe deﬁciency of oxygen may
result  in  elemental  carbon,  C,  forming  instead  of  carbon  dioxide  or  carbon
monoxide.

The alkanes are the only organic compounds with no functional group. For this
reason, they do not react readily other than by combustion. However, one of
the few types of reactions in which the alkanes participate are substitution reac-
tions. As the name implies, something will substitute for something else in the
alkane. Normally the reaction involves an alkane, a halogen (either chlorine or
bromine), and light. Light is necessary to initiate the reaction. In a substitution
reaction of this type, a halogen atom substitutes for a hydrogen reaction. This
process may continue until halogen atoms replace all the hydrogen atoms. To
minimize  the  opportunity  for  multiple  replacements  occurring,  an  excess  of

Organic, Biochemistry, and Polymers

317

alkane is normally present. The following is an example of a substitution reac-
tion. The symbol, hn, indicates light energy.

CH3CH3 ⫹ Cl2

hn4

CH3CH2Cl ⫹ HCl

Quick Tip

In many organic reactions, compounds such as HCl are not included in the ﬁnal
answer. The key to the organic reaction equation is what happens to the organic
compound and not perfecting a balanced chemical equation.

Aromatic hydrocarbons, like alkanes, undergo substitution reactions. The con-
ditions required for an aromatic compound to react are different than that for
the reaction of an alkane. Aromatic substitution reactions are beyond the scope
of this text.

Don’t Forget!

The  separate  resonance  structures  for  the  aromatic  hydrocarbons  show  C=C
bonds. These may appear the same as similar bonds in alkenes, but resonance
negates any similarity in behavior.

Alkenes and alkynes typically react by addition reactions. As the name implies,
two or more molecules simply add together. Normally, one product results with
a  formula  that  is  simply  the  sum  of  the  reactant  pieces.  Only  the  functional
group, the carbon-carbon double or triple bond, will change during the reac-
tion.  Two  typical  addition  reactions  are  hydrogenation  and  halogenation.  In
hydrogenation,  we  add  a  hydrogen,  H2,  molecule.  Thus,  C2H4 will  become
C2H4⫹2 ⫽ C2H6. Hydrogenation always requires a catalyst. The most common
catalysts are platinum, Pt, palladium, Pd, or nickel, Ni. In a halogenation reac-
tion,  we  add  a  halogen,  either  chlorine  or  bromine.  No  catalyst  is  necessary,
and, unlike the reaction with an alkane, light is not necessary. The formation of
a  polymer,  such  as  polypropylene,  is  an  addition  reaction.  For  this  reason,
polypropylene is an example of an addition polymer.

318

CHEMISTRY FOR THE UTTERLY CONFUSED

The following illustrates the hydrogenation and halogenation, with bromine, of
the  alkene  propene.  Notice  that  the [CH3 group,  which  is  not  a  functional
group, does not change during either reaction.

The hydrogenation of an alkyne can give two possible products. If there is a lim-
ited  quantity  of  hydrogen  available,  hydrogenation  converts  an  alkyne  to  an
alkene.  If  more  hydrogen  is  available,  the  alkene  will  react  to  become  an
alkane. The following illustrates the hydrogenation of propyne. Only the ﬁrst
step occurs if there is not much hydrogen, while the second step occurs if there
is sufﬁcient hydrogen remaining after the ﬁrst step.

Quick Tip

If you are told to use 2 mol of hydrogen or excess hydrogen, the second result
is the answer.

The halogenation of an alkyne, like hydrogenation, can give two possible prod-
ucts.  A  limited  amount  of  halogen  will  only  add  one  molecule,  whereas  an
excess of halogen will add two molecules.

The  other  functional  groups  participate  in  a  variety  of  reactions.  We  have
already seen some of these reactions. The carboxylic acids will behave as typi-
cal weak acids. The amines will behave as typical weak bases. The only other
category of reaction we will examine here is a condensation reaction.

Organic, Biochemistry, and Polymers

319

A condensation reaction joins two molecules and splits out a small molecule. The
small molecule is usually water. The formation of a peptide bond is an example
of a condensation reaction. The conditions necessary for a condensation reaction
vary with the functional groups involved. In most cases, a catalyst will be present.
The two most common catalysts are acids and enzymes. Two alcohols will con-
dense to form an ether. A carboxylic acid condenses with an alcohol to form an
ester. A carboxylic acid condenses with an amine to form an amide.

Be Careful!

A carboxylic acid can react with an amine via an acid-base reaction. Take care to
bypass this reaction.

The  following  illustrates  the  reaction  of  two  alcohols  to  form  an  ether.  The
reacting molecules are both molecules of a-glucose. This reaction occurs in the
presence  of  an  enzyme  catalyst,  which  prevents  the  other  functional  groups
from reacting. In biochemistry, an ether group is a glycoside linkage. The join-
ing of two molecules of the monosaccharide, b-glucose, gives the disaccharide,
lactose. The joining of additional b-glucose molecules will eventually generate
the  polysaccharide,  cellulose.  If  we  replace  the  b-glucose  with  a-glucose,  the
disaccharide would be maltose. A polysaccharide of a-glucose is starch.

It is possible to reverse the formation of an ester by a catalyzed hydrolysis reac-
tion. In this reaction, the water reenters the molecule where it was removed. If
an acid is the catalyst, the original acid and alcohol will reform. If a base is the
catalyst, the alcohol will reform; however, the acid will react further to produce
its conjugate base. The base-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester is saponiﬁcation.

If a molecule has multiple functional groups, multiple reactions may occur. For
example, the reaction of molecules with two carboxylic acid groups might react
with molecules containing two alcohol groups in the following manner.

condensation reactions were amino acids, the amide groups would be peptide
bonds, and the polymer would be a polypeptide or a protein.

Organic chemistry is the study of carbon containing compounds. Hydrocarbons
contain only carbon and hydrogen. Alkanes contain only carbon-to-carbon sin-
gle bonds, while alkenes contain a carbon-to-carbon double bond and alkynes
contain  a  triple  bond.  There  are  systematic  rules  for  naming  organic  com-
pounds. Functional groups are groups in organic compounds that give the mol-
ecule its characteristic reactivity.

Polymers  are  large,  high  molecular  weight  compounds  formed  by  linking
together smaller monomer units. Proteins are naturally occurring polymers of
amino acid monomer units joined by a peptide bond. Carbohydrates are com-
posed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Cellulose and starch are examples of
carbohydrates. Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, direct and store information for
reproduction and cellular growth.

There are a number of important types of organic reactions, including combus-
tion,  substitution,  addition  (such  as  hydrogenation,  and  halogenation.),  con-
densation, as well as many others.

1. How many carbon atoms may bond together?
2. What are the four types of hydrocarbons?
3. What type(s) of organic compounds react in combustion reactions?

of an alkene?

6. When naming an alkane, what sufﬁx must be present?

About the Authors

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

JOHN MOORE grew up in the foothills of Western North Carolina. He attended the
University of North Carolina at Asheville where he received his bachelor’s degree
in chemistry. He earned his master’s degree in chemistry from Furman University
in Greenville, South Carolina. After a stint in the U.S. Army, he decided to try his
hand at teaching. In 1971, he joined the chemistry faculty of Stephen F. Austin State
University  in  Nacogdoches,  Texas,  where  he  still  teaches  chemistry.  In  1985,  he
started back to school part time and in 1991, he received his doctorate in educa-
tion from Texas A&M University. For the past several years, he has been the coed-
itor of the Chemistry for Kids feature of The Journal of Chemical Education and a
grader for the free-response section of the AP Chemistry Exam. In 2003, his ﬁrst
book, Chemistry for Dummies, was published. For the past several years, he has
been a grader for the Free-Response section of the AP Chemistry exam.

RICHARD “DOC”  LANGLEY grew  up  in  southwestern  Ohio.  He  attended  Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio, where he received bachelor’s degrees in chemistry and
in  mineralogy.  He  also  received  a  master’s  degree  in  chemistry  from  Miami
University.  He went to the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he
received  his  doctorate  in  chemistry.  He  then  took  a  postdoctoral  position  at
Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, and then a visiting assistant professor
position at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls before moving to Stephen F.
Austin in 1982. For the past several years, he also has been a grader for the Free-
Response section of the AP Chemistry Exam. Richard and John have worked
together on several writing projects, including 5 Steps to a 5: AP Chemistry.
