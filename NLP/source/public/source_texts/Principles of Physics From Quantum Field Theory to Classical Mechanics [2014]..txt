Preface

During the 20th century, physics experienced a rapid expansion. A gen-
eral theoretical physics curriculum now consists of a collection of separate
courses labeled as classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechan-
ics, statistical mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory, general relativity, etc., with
each course taught in a diﬀerent book. I consider there is a need to write
a book which is compact and merge these courses into one single uniﬁed
course. This book is an attempt to realize this aim. In writing this book, I
focus on two purposes. (1) Historically, physics is established from classical
mechanics to quantum mechanics, from quantum mechanics to quantum
ﬁeld theory, from thermodynamics to statistical mechanics, and from New-
tonian gravity to general relativity. However, a more logical subsequent
presentation is from quantum ﬁeld theory to classical mechanics, and from
the physics principles on the microscopic scale to physics on the macro-
scopic scale. In this book, I try to achieve this by elucidating the physics
from quantum ﬁeld theory to classical mechanics from a set of common ba-
sic principles in a uniﬁed way. (2) Physics is considered as an experimental
science. This view, however, is being changed. In the history of physics,
there are two epic heroes: Newton and Einstein. They represent two epochs
in physics. In the Newtonian epoch, physical laws are deduced from exper-
imental observations. People are amazed that the observed physical laws
can be described accurately by mathematical equations. At the same time,
it is reasonable to ask why nature should obey the physical laws described
by the mathematical equations. After wondering how accurately nature
obeys the gravitational law that the gravitation force is proportional to the
inverse square of the distance, one would ask why it is not found in other
ways. Einstein creates a new epoch by deducing physical laws not merely
from experiments but also from principles such as simplicity, symmetry

and other understandable credos. From the view of Einstein, physical laws
should be natural and simple. It is my belief that all physics laws should
be understandable. In this book, I endeavor to establish the physical for-
malisms based on basic principles that are as simple and understandable
as possible.

The book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, including
quantum ﬁeld theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermo-
dynamics, general relativity, electromagnetic ﬁeld, and classical mechanics.
Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the subjects and formalisms are
arranged in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from
the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained, i.e.
the derivations of all the physical formulas which appear in this book can
be found in the same book. Most of the required mathematical tools are
also given in the appendices. Although this book covers all the disciplines
of fundamental physics, the book is compact and has only about 400 pages
because the contents are concise and can be treated as an integrated entity.
In this book, the main emphasis is the basic formalisms of physics. The
topics on applications and approximation methods are kept to a minimum
and are selected based on their generality and importance. Still it was not
easy to do it when some important topics had to be omitted. Since it is
impossible to provide an exhaustive bibliography, I list only the related
textbooks and monographs that I am familiar with.
I apologize to the
authors whose books have not been included unintentionally.

This book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students.
It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental
physics.

I am grateful to all my colleagues and students for their inspiration and
help. I would also like to express my gratitude to World Scientiﬁc for the
assistance rendered in publishing this book.

Basic Principles

We start from the following ﬁve basic principles to construct all other phys-
ical laws and equations. These ﬁve basic principles are: (1) Constituent
principle: the basic constituents of matter are various kinds of identical
particles. This can also be called locality principle; (2) Causality principle:
the future state depends only on the present state; (3) Covariance principle:
the physics should be invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transforma-
tion; (4) Invariance or Symmetry principle: the spacetime is homogeneous;
(5) Equi-probability principle: all the states in an isolated system are ex-
pected to be occupied with equal probability. These ﬁve basic principles
can be considered as physical common senses. It is very natural to have
these basic principles. More important is that these ﬁve basic principles are
consistent with one another. From these ﬁve principles, we derive a vast
set of equations which explains or promise to explain all the phenomena of
the physical world.

2.1  Commutators 

2 .1.1 

I den tical  particles  principle 

We  start  from  the  constituent  principle.  Matter  consists  of various  kinds 
of identical particles.  Since  particles are local  identities,  this  principle can 
be  considered  as  the  locality  principle.  A  particle  is  characterized  by  its 
position and other internal degrees of freedom which are denoted as-\.  Such 
a particle is called to be in the-\ state which is  denoted by I-\).  The symbol 
I ) is  called  ket,  which  was  introduced  by  Dirac.  I-\)  means  that there is  a 
particle characterized by -\.  I-\)  is  also  called a  single-particle state.  An  N(cid:173)
particle state is  denoted  as  I -\ 1  ·  ·  · Ai · · · AN).  Here i  labels the ith particle. 
A  state  of  a  system  corresponds  to  a  configuration  of the  particles.  We 
denote  IO)  as  the  vacuum  state,  which  contains  no  particles.  When  there 
is  creation,  there  should  be  annihilation.  For  a  vacuum  state  IO),  we  can 
introduce its dual state  (01  by 

(OIO)  = 1. 

(2.1) 

Eq.  (2.1)  means  that  (OI  annihilates the state  IO).  Similarly,  for  any state 
I-\),  we  have its dual state  (-\I  defined  by 

(-\I-\)  = 1. 

(2.2) 

Eq.  (2.1)  means that  (-\I  annihilates the state I-\).  The symbol  ( I is  called 
bra.

Principles  of Physics 

2 .1. 2  Projection  operator 
We  can  define  a  projection  operator  for  single-particle  states  by  1>-) (>.1, 
which projects any state 1>-')  onto the state 1>-),  resulting in  a  state 

(2.3) 
When  the  states  lA')  and  1>-)  are  different  (>.  -=f  A'),  the  projection of the 
state lA')  onto the state 1>-)  will  be zero.  We  have 

1>-)(>-1>-'). 

(>-1>-')  =  c5,\,\'. 

(2.4) 

When  a  particle  is  in  the >.  state,  the  projection  operator  for  the >.  state 
projects the  state onto  itself.  When  a  particle  is  in  the  A'  -=f  >.  state,  the 
projection operator filters out this state.  Eq.  (2.4)  is called the orthonormal 
relation  of states.  We  also  call  (>.lA')  as  the  scalar  product  of two  states. 
When  >.  is  a  continuous  variable,  the  Kronecker  delta  should  be  replaced 
by the delta function. 

We can add the projections 1>-) (>.1  of all states together.  Since a  particle 

at least  is  in one state, we  have 

2::: 1>-)\>-1  = 1. 

,\ 

(2.5) 

Eq.  (2.5)  is  called the completeness relation of single-particle state. 

2.1.3  Creation  and  annihilation  operators 

We  introduce creation  and  annihilation  operators to  describe  the  particle 
state.  We  define  the  creation  operator  as  the  one  mapping  an  N-particle 
state  onto  an  (N+l)-particle  state.  For  the  vacuum  state,  we  can  add 
particles  using  the  creation  operator a\.  >.  can  be  position  of a  particle. 
When >.  is  the position, a 1 means creating a  local particle at >.  position.  If 
we  create a  particle characterized by >.,  we  have  a  state 

a 1 can also  be denoted  as 

a\IO)  = 1>-). 

(2.6) 

(2.7) 
®  means that a 1 is  operated on a  state.  ®  is  often omitted for  simplicity. 
Thus Eq.  (2.6)  can be rewritten as 

1>-)  ®. 

a\IO)  = 1>-)  ® IO)  = 1>-). 

(2.8) 

Quantum  Fields

The  N-particle  state  IA1  ·  ·  · Ai ···AN)  can  be  formed  using  N  creation 

operators, 

IA1  ···AN) =at · · · alN IO) 

=  IA1)  ® .. ·IAN)® IO). 

(2.9) 

In exchanging the two creation operators, we  exchange the labels of the 
two  generated  particles.  We  denote  Pij  the  operator  that  exchanges  the 
labels of the particles i  and j.  For example, 

(2.10) 
IA1A2)  means  that  there  is  a  particle  at  x1  position  characterized  by  the 
internal degrees  of freedom  A~ and  a  particle at x2  position  characterized 
by the internal degrees of freedom  A~.  IA2A1)  means that there is  a particle 
at  x 2  position  characterized  by  the  internal  degrees  of freedom  A~ and  a 
particle  at  x 1  position  characterized  by  the  internal  degrees  of  freedom 
A~.  If the  two  particles  are  fundamental,  there  will  be  no  other  internal 
degrees  of freedom  to  distinguish  them,  which  means  that  A  has  all  the 
parameters to characterize a particle.  The particles are identical.  Then the 
states IA1A2)  and  IA2A1) describe the same state, i.e.  a state with a particle 
at  x 1  position  characterized  by  the  internal  degrees  of freedom  A~  and  a 
particle at x 2  position characterized by the internal degrees of freedom  A~. 
Thus when  we  exchange the two  particles,  we  have the same state.  When 
we  execute the exchange operator two  times,  the  particles  return to their 
initial labels and we  recover the original state.  Thus  P 2  = 1 and  P  = ±1. 
Because P  = ±1, we have two cases.  (i)  The two creation operators at and 
at commute, at at =a tat, which  corresponds toP= 1;  (ii)  The two 
creation  operators at  and  at  anti-commute,  at at =  -at at' which 
corresponds to P  = -1. 

If at and at commute,  we  call  the  particles  bosons.  For  bosons,  we 

have the commutation relation 

(2.11) 
If at and at anti-commute,  we  call the particles fermions.  For  fermions, 
we  have the anti-commutation relation 

(2.12) 
Thus  any  two  creation  operators at and  at commute  or  anti-commute 
depending  on  the  types  of  particles.  For  fermions,  in  the  case  of  A1  = 
A2  =A, the  anti-commutation  relation Eq.  (2.12)  becomes 2a1a1  = 0,  i.e.

Principles  of Physics 

&1&1  =  0.  Thus two fermions  can not be accommodated in the same state, 
which  is  known  as the  Pauli  exclusion principle. 

Now  we  introduce annihilation operator&>...  The annihilation operator 
maps  an  N-particle  state  onto  an  (N-1)-particle  state.  The  annihilation 
operator a>..  thus annihilates the particle characterized by-\.  In the simplest 
situation, we  have 

(2.13) 

which means that after annihilating the single-particle state, the state turns 
into the vacuum state. 

Similar  to  the  creation  operators,  we  have  the  following  two  types  of 

commutation relations for  the annihilation operators.  For boson,  the anni(cid:173)
hilation operators commute, 

For fermions,  the annihilation operators anti-commute, 

Similar to the creation operators, we  can denote a>..  as 

(2.14) 

(2.15) 

(2.16) 

The bracket means that &1  acts on the left.  Then Eq.  (2.13)  can be rewrit(cid:173)
ten as 

&>..1-\)  =  &>..1-\)  ®10) 
=(-\I-\) ®IO) 
=  IO). 

Since  (-\IO)  = 0,  we  have 

(2.17) 

(2.18) 

Eq.  (2.18)  means that when there is  no  particle for  annihilation,  the anni(cid:173)
hilation operator should be zero.  Eq.  (2.18)  has a  more general version 

&>..1l-\2)  = 0, 

-\1  #- -\2. 

(2.19) 

From Eq.  (2.16),  we  have 

\01&>..1-\')  =(-\I-\')= (-\'I-\)= (-\'l&11o)  =  (h>..'· 

(2.20) 

Thus &>..  can be considered as the adjoint operator of &1.

The state  I.A.)  forms  the  Hilbert  space 1i.  I.A.)  is  called  an orthonormal 
basis  of 1i.  The  N-particle  state  are  described  in  the  Hilbert  space  1iN, 
which is  the N  tensor product of the single-particle Hilbert space 1i. 

(2.21) 
The N-particle state l.\ 1 ···AN) is  the tensor product of the single-particle 
state. 

Since  the  particles  are  elemental  and  no  particle  is  a  part  of other  parti(cid:173)
cles,  the state  l.\1 ···AN)  are orthonormal.  l.\1  ···AN)  form  the  canonical 
orthonormal basis of 1iN.  It should be noted that the states with different 
particle  number  are  also  orthonormal.  All  particle  states  form  the  Fock 
space.

2.1.4  Symmetrized  and  anti-symmetrized states 

In  order  to  describe  the  symmetry  properties  of the  states  of bosons  and 
fermions,  we  introduce  the  symmetrization  operator  PB  and  the  anti(cid:173)
symmetrization operator Pp.

where  P  is  the  permutation of (1, 2 · · ·  , N),  which  brings  (1, 2 · · · , N)  to

in  the  permutation  P  that  brings  (1, 2 · · · , N)  to  (P1 , P2  ·  ·  ·  , PN ).  For 
example,  for  two  particles, 

PBIA1A2)  =  2(1.\1.\2) + l.\2.\1) ),

The states of bosons are symmetric.  We  can use  PBI.\1 ···AN) to describe 
the  state of bosons  regardless  of the  symmetry of I .\1  ·  ·  · AN).  The states 
of fermions  are  antisymmetric.  We  can  use  Ppl.\1 ···AN)  to  describe  the 
state of fermions  regardless of the symmetry of l.\1  ···AN).  The states of 
bosons  form  the Hilbert  space of bosons  B N,  while  the states of fermions

make  up the Hilbert space of fermions  FN.  Eq.  (2.23)  can  be rewritten in 
a  compact form  as

where~= 1 for  PB  and~= -1 for  Pp. 

P{ ~}  can  be  shown  to  be  the  projections  that  project  HN  onto  the 

Hilbert space of bosons B N  and the Hilbert space of fermions  F N,  respec(cid:173)

We  introduce Q =  P' P.  Since  ~Sp,+SP =  ~sP'P and Q corresponds toP' 
one by one,  we  have 

Eq.  (2.27)  holds  for  any  state.  Thus  P{ ~}  are  the  projection  operators 
projecting HN  onto { ~~ }. 

Using these projection operators, we can define the symmetrized or anti(cid:173)

symmetrized states as 

(2.27) 

It  is  usually  convenient  to  use  the  normalized  symmetrized  or  anti(cid:173)
symmetrized  states.  The  scalar  product  of the  two  same symmetrized  or

(2.29) 

According to Eq.  (2.4),  the only non-vanishing terms in  the summation of 
Eq.  (2.29)  are the ones with 

(2.30) 

For  fermions,  there is  at  most  one  particle with the same  A.  Ai  in  the 
set  (A1, · · · , AN)  are  all  different.  There  is  only  one  nonzero  term  which 
corresponds to S p  = 0.  Thus we  have 

(2.31) 

which  means that  IA1, A2, · · · AN)s  is  already normalized. 

For  bosons,  particles  with  the  same  A are  allowed.  Any  permutation 
which  interchanges  the  particles  with  the  same  A contributes  to  the  sum 
in  Eq.  (2.29).  If the state  IA1, A2, ···AN)  contains  n1  bosons with  A= o:1, 
n2  bosons  with  A =  0:2,  · · ·,  np  bosons  with  A =  ap,  where  all  the o:i  are 
different,  the scalar product Eq.  (2.29)  is  given by 

with 

(2.32) 

(2.33) 

Since  ni  =  1 for  fermions,  Eq.  (2.32)  is  also  applicable for  fermions.  Thus 
we  obtain the normalized  symmetrized or anti-symmetrized states defined 
by

2.1.5  Commutators  between  creation  and  annihilation 

operators 

When we  apply al  to the symmetrical N-particle boson state, we  have 

allnA)  = k(alt>-+ 110) 

=  v'n>:+T  (alt>-+liO) 

yl(n-\ + 1)! 

(2.36) 
The annihilation operator a-\  is  the adjoint operator of the creation opera(cid:173)
tor.  Thus we  have 

=  Jn-\ + 1jn-\ + 1). 

Therefore,  we  have 

a-\jn-\)  =~In-\- 1). 

Using Eqs.  (2.36)  and  (2.38),  we  have 

ala-\ln-\)  = n-\ln-\), 
a-\alln-\)  = (n-\ + l)ln-\)· 

Subtracting the two equations, we  obtain 
[a-\, alJ  = 1. 

Now  we  derive  the  commutator  of  aA  and  al,  with  ), 

Eqs.  (2.36)  and  (2.38),  we  have

and

= ~ JnA' + 11· · · (n-\- 1) · · · (nA'  + 1) · · · ). 

(2.43) 

This leads to 

(2.44) 
Thus we  obtain the commutation relation for  the annihilation operator a-\ 1 
and the creation operator at 

[a-\1, atJ = 8-\1-\2 · 

(2.45) 

Quantum  Fields 

11 

Now  we  consider  fermions.  Fermions  obey the  anti-commutation rela(cid:173)
tions.  Thus a1 a1  = 0 and a>..a>..  = 0.  n>..  can only be one or zero.  Therefore, 
we  have the following  relations: 

a11o)  = 1(1)>..), 
a>..l(1)>..)  =  IO), 

a11(1)>..)  = o, 
a>..IO)  =  0. 

(2.46) 

In order to deduce the  commutator  [a>.., a1,J,  we  consider the following 

state 

If n>..s  = 0,  the direct  evaluation of at ln>..l n>..l  ... n>..x)  gives 

attn>..1n>..2 ···n>..x) = (-1)Ss(at)n>- 1  ···(a1J···(a1x)n>-xl0),  (2.48) 

where the factor  Ss  is  defined  by 

(2.47) 

(2.49) 

Thus, we  have 

a1Jn>..l n>..2  ... n>..x) 

= (-1)Ssln>.. 1  •  •  •  (n>..s  + 1) · · ·n>..x) 

(if n>..s  = 0). 

(2.50) 

When  n As  =  1'  we  can  exchange  at to  the  position  As  and  get  a  factor 
atat, which  leads to 

(2.51) 

Now  we  consider  the  annihilating operator  a>..s.  When  n>..s  =  1,  since  a>..s 
is  the adjoint of operator at' we  have 

(n>.. 1  •  •  •  (n>..s  - 1) · · · n>..,,Ja>..Jn>..1 · · · n>..s  · · · n>..x) 

= (n>.. 1  •  •  ·  n>..s  · · · n>..x ta1Jn>.. 1  •  •  •  (n>..s  - 1) · · · n>..x) 
= (n>..l  ... n>..s  ... n>..x I ( -l)Ss ln>..l  ... n>..s  ... n>..x)  = ( -1 )Ss. 

(2.52) 

Thus, we  have 

a>..s ln>..l  ... n>..s  ... n>..x) 

=  ( -1)Ss ln>. 1  •  •  •  (n>..s  - 1) · · · n>.x)  (if n>.s  =  1). 

(2.53) 

If n>..s  = 0,  we  can similarly get 

a>.s ln>.l  ... n>.s  ... n>.x)  = 0. 

(2.54) 
In  summary of the  results  given  by  Eqs.  (2.50),  (2.51),  (2.53)  and  (2.54), 
we  can easily obtain 

(if n>.s  = 0).

are  also  the  commutation  relations  at different  times  [a>. 1 (t), at (t')l±·  In 
order to calculate the commutation relations at different times,  we  need to 
know  the equations of motion.  We  will  discuss  the commutation relations 
at different times  [a>.l (t), at (t')]±  after we  derive the equations of motion. 
We  introduce a(x, t)  and at (x, t)  by taking  A in  a1  and a>.  as  position 
X.  Then a1  takes the meaning of creating a  particle at  position  X  and a,\ 
annihilating a  particle at position X.  a1  and a,\  become at(x, t)  and a(x, t) 
respectively.  Since  A =  x  as  position  is  a  continuous  variable.  b>. 1>. 2  in 
Eq.  (2.55)  should  be  replaced  by  a  delta  function  63 (x1  - x 2 ).  Then  we 
have 

[a(x, t), at (x', t)]±  = 63 (x- x'), 
[at(x,t),at(x',t)]± =  [a(x,t),a(x',t)]± =  o.

With the help of the creation and annihilation operators, we  can define 

the particle-number density operator 

n(x, t)  =at (x, t)a(x, t) 

and the total particle-number operator 

N(t) = j d3xi\(x, t) = j d3xal(x, t)il(x, t).

2.2  The equations of motion 

2.2.1  Field  operators 

Now  we  discuss  the  particle  dynamics.  For  bosons,  we  define  two  field 
operators 

J,(x, t) = ~(at (x, t) + ii(x, t)), 

ir(x, t)  =  ~(at(x, t)- a(x, t)). 

(2.59a) 

(2.59b) 

We  have for  their commutators 

[¢(x,t),ir(x',t)]  =  ~[(a(x,t)at(x',t) -at(x',t)a(x,t)) 
+ (a(x', t)at(x, t)- at(x, t)a(x', t))] 

= ~([a(x, t), at (x', t)]  + [a(x', t), at (x, t)]) 
= i63 (x- x')

and also 

[¢(x, t), ¢(x', t)]  =  [7T(x, t), ?t(x', t)]  =  0. 

(2.61) 

For  fermions,  we  can  not  use  the  definition  Eq.  (2.59),  which  will  lead  to 

{ ¢, 7T}  =  0.  If we  define  7T  = ~(at +a)  =  i¢t,  we  can  have  Eq.  (2.60). 

However,  ¢  and  7T  should  be  independent.  Thus  ¢  should  not  be  a  real 
operator.  We  can  use  two  real  field  operators ¢ 1  and  ¢2  corresponding to 
a  doublet of particles to form  a  complex field.  We  define 

with 

(2.62a) 

(2.62b) 

(2.63) 

Then we  have two independent complex field  operators and we  can treat ¢ 

and  7T  = i¢t  as  independent  field  operators.  The  field  operators  ¢  and  7T 

for  fermions  obey the following  commutation relations 

{ ¢(x, t). ?t(x', t)} =  i63 (x- x') 

and 

{ ¢(x, t), ¢(x', t)} = { ?t(x, t), ?t(x', t)} = 0. 

7T  is  called the conjugate field  operator and is  equivalent to

For  bosons,  using the commutation relation Eq.  (2.60),  we  have

Generally the particle could have internal degrees of freedom.  The par(cid:173)

the  field  operator ¢ can  be,  for  example,  vector  or  spinor,  in  addition  to 
scalar. 

2.2.2  The  generator  of time  translation 

In order to consider the dynamics of particles, we  introduce the time trans(cid:173)

lation  operator 6 = eiGtt,  where  Gt(fr, ¢)  is  the  generator  of translation 

transformation of timet.  By definition of the generator of time translation, 
we  have 

[¢, Gt]  = iat¢, 
[fr, Gt]  = i8tfr.

solved  by

Eq.  (2.82)  is the transformation for  a finite translation of timet.  Eq.  (2.82)

From  the  commutation  relations  for  the  generator  of  time  translation 
Eq.  (2.81 ),  it  can  be  seen  that  the  right-hand  side  of  Eq.  (2.82)  is  just

satisfying 

¢(x, t) 1¢, t)  =  ¢(x, t) 1¢, t). 

(2.85) 

The  time  dependence  of the  state vector  1¢, t),  expressed  in  terms  of the 
constant state vector  I¢)  (also  called  the  Heisenberg  vector)  is  determined 
by 

(2.86) 

2.2.3  Transition  amplitude 

Now  we  can  determine  the  scalar  product  of  two  state  vectors  taken  at 
different times(¢', t'l¢, t),  which is  also called the  transition  amplitude  be(cid:173)
tween the two state vectors.  Using Eq.  (2.86),  we  have 

(¢',t'1¢,t)  =  (¢'1e-i(t'-t)Gtl¢). 

(2.87) 

This amplitude is  also named as the Feynman kernel.  This is the amplitude 
for  making a transition from  the field  configuration ¢(x)  at time t,  leading 
to the field  configuration ¢ ( x')  at time t'.

2.2.4  Causality  principle 
Now  let  us  discuss  the  properties of the generator of time translation Gt. 
All  the time evolution processes should obey the causality principle, which 
is  the  most  basic  principle  of physics.  The  causality  principle  can  be  ex(cid:173)
pressed as follows:  The future state is only determined by the present state. 
Therefore,  the generator of time translation Gt  can  be expressed solely  as 
a function of the field  at t without any time derivatives of J and ir because 
the time derivatives depend on the quantities in the future.  This statement 
does  not mean that one can not have an expression of Gt  with time deriva(cid:173)
tives of J and fr  in it.  It says that one can find  an expression of Gt  without 
time derivatives of J and  ir  in  it.  Now  we  express Gt  as  a  function  of the 
field  operators 

(2.88) 
Qt(ir, ¢)  does  not  contain  the  time  derivatives  of J and  ir,  while  spatial 
derivatives are allowed. 

2.2.5  Path  integral formulas 

We  can  construct  the  path  integral  formulas  to  calculate  the  transition 
amplitude.  We  divide  the  time  interval  (t, t')  into  many small  slices  with 
equal length.

(2.91) 
Using  Eq.  (2.87),  each  of the  kernel  elements  under  the  integral  can  be 
rewritten as 

(2.92) 
When  E  is  small,  the  time  evolution  operator  can  be  approximated  by  a 
Taylor expansion

Principles  of Physics 

Instead  of  £'(1r, ¢),  we  have  the  function  £(¢, ¢)  as  Lagrangian  density. 
Using  the  Lagrangian  density  £(¢, ¢),  we  can  define  the  action  S  of the 
field  by 

(2.108) 

Thus  we  have  two  types  of  formulas  for  Lagrangians.  We  will  show 
that one corresponds to  fermions  and the other corresponds to bosons.  It 
should be noted that we  need  use  Grassmann algebra (a brief introduction 
on Grassmann algebra is  shown in the Appendix D)  in the path integration 
for  fermions. 

2.2. 7  Covariance  principle 

In the following,  we  assume that the path integral should satisfy the prin(cid:173)
ciple  of  general  covariance  stating  that  the  physics,  as  embodied  in  the 
path integral, must be invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transforma(cid:173)
tion.  Generally,  we  shall  consider  any curved  spacetime.  First we  discuss 
the  fiat  spacetime,  which  is  applicable  to  the  case  of vacuum  state.  For 
a  Riemann  metric,  we  can  always  find  a  local  Minkowski  metric.  We  will 
show  in  a  later section  that when  the field  is  weak,  as  in the case  of near 
vacuum  state,  we  can  use  the  Minkowski  metric.  In  order  to  satisfy  the 
causality  principle,  time  can  only  be  one-dimensional.  We  have  assumed 
that  space  is  three-dimensional.  There  are  several  reasons  for  a  three(cid:173)
dimensional  space.  At  the  present  stage,  we  can  only  assume  that  the 
space  is  three-dimensional.  Matter,  space,  and time  should  be  considered 
as an integrated entity, as Einstein proposed.  If time and space are indepen(cid:173)
dent,  the interaction between  particles will  be  instantaneous,  which  is  not 
consistent  in  concept  with  the  causality  principle.  Because  of the  causal(cid:173)
ity  principle,  a  fiat  spacetime  can only be  Minkowski-type.  An  Euclidean 
type spacetime will  not  be consistent  with the causality principle  because 
it extends time into the four-dimensional.  The Lagrangian density £' or £ 
should be scalar in the Minkowski metric.  We  use  a  Minkowski metric TJ'w 
with  signature  [ +, -, -, -] in  this  chapter.  By  now,  only  a  few  forms  of 
Lagrangian densities  are  found  to  satisfy  both the causality principle  and 
the covariance principle.  Because 9t(7r, ¢)  depends only on time locally,  it 
does  not  depend  on  the  time  derivative  of field  functions.  It  can  depend 
on  the spatial  derivatives  of field  functions.  As  we  have  shown,  there  are 

Quantum  Fields 

21 

two  cases:  (1)  £' is  Lorentz  covariant;  (2)  C is  Lorentz  covariant.  For  the 
first  case,  from  Eq.  (2.102),  we  can  see  that  £' depends  on  ¢  linearly.  In 
order to get  a  covariant  Lagrangian density £',  9t ( 1r, ¢)  should  depend on 
the spatial derivatives linearly.  We  will  show that this case corresponds to 
the spinor fermion field  in the later section.  For the second case, we need to 
carry out the integration over field  function 1r.  When 9t ( 1r, ¢) is  a quadratic 
function  of 1r,  we  can get  a  ¢ 2  term in  £( ¢, ¢)  after  completing the  Gaus(cid:173)
sian integration over 1r  in the path integral formulation in Eq.  (2.107).  The 
¢ 2  term can match with other spatial derivative terms to form  a  covariant 
Lagrangian density.  Thus 9t ( 1r, ¢) should also contain the quadratic spatial 
derivatives of field  functions.  After integrating out the field  function  1r,  we 
obtain  the  Lorentz-covariant  Lagrangian  £( ¢, ¢)  in  the  Minkowski  space(cid:173)
time.  We  will  show that one can get two types of covariant Lagrangians in 
this  way.  They  correspond  to  the scalar  and  vector  bosons.  For  9t ( 1r, ¢) 
with other orders of spatial derivative of field  functions  or power functions 
of 1r,  we  can not find  any covariant  constructions of Lagrangian.  Although 
this  is  not  a  strict  proof,  it  is  plausible  that  there  are  no  other  types  of 
9t ( 1r, ¢)  that can lead to covariant Lagrangian C or £'.  In addition, we will 
show  later that the  energy  is  conserved  due  to the  homogeneity of space(cid:173)
time.  Then the Hamiltonian operator should commute with the generator 
of time translation, which also excludes other possibility.  From Eq.  (2.106), 
we  can see  that there is  only first  order derivative  ¢  in  the Lagrangian £' 
and £.  Therefore, Lagrangian can only depend on the first order derivative 
¢.  In  the  £( ¢, ¢),  there  is  only  ¢ 2  term.  ¢ 2  may  be  transformed  into  ¢ 
through integration by parts.  Therefore,  Lagrangian can only contain¢ or 
¢ 2  (or equivalently ¢)  terms linearly.  This constrains the form of covariant 
Lagrangian stiffiy.  We will see that there are only very limited forms of the 
covariant Lagrangians. 

2.3  Scalar  field 

The Lagrangian should be a  scalar in the Minkowski spacetime due to the 
covariance  principle.  Since  the  simplest  field  is  the  scalar  field,  we  first 
consider the scalar field.  It should be noted that the underlining  principle 
is  independent  of the types of the fields  contained in the Lagrangian. 

22 

Principles  of Physics 

2.3.1  Lagrangian 

Since  the  derivatives  can only be  quadratic,  the general  form  of covariant 
Lagrangian for  a  scalar field  has the form 

f(¢) can be put into the metric g~v when we  use the curved spacetime for(cid:173)
malism,  which we  will  discuss  in  detail in the section on the curved space(cid:173)
time.  U(¢)  is  generally divided  into the mass term  ~m 2 ¢2  and interaction 
term V(¢). 

(2.109) 

(2.110) 

where  m  is  called  the  mass  and  V(¢)  is  the  self-interaction.  Thus  the 
general form of Lagrangian density in the Minkowski spacetime for  a scalar 
field  is  given by 

(2.111) 

We  have  chosen  the  proper  unit  of field  function  such  that  the  first  term 
in  Eq.  (2.111)  has  the  form  without  any  parameter.  We  can  also  put  n2 
in  the  first  term  and  reformulate  the  first  term  as  ~2 8~¢8~¢ to  make  the 
unit  transformation easier,  where  n is  called  the  Planck  constant.  All  the 
terms in  Eq.  (2.111)  are scalars in the spacetime.  Thus the Lagrangian in 
Eq.  ( 2.111)  is  Lorentz  covariant.  The  corresponding  function  9t ( 1r, ¢)  is 
given  by 

(2.112) 

which  does  not  contain  the  time  derivative  terms.  We  can  get  the  La(cid:173)
grangian  density  in  Eq.  (2.111)  by  inserting  Eq.  (2.112)  into  Eq.  (2.107) 
and  integrating over  7r  using  the  Gaussian  integral  formula  Eq.  (C.21)  in 
the  Appendix  C.  Thus the generator of time translation corresponding to 
the Lagrangian Eq.  (2.111)  is  given  by 

G,  =  j d3x  [~7T2 + ~('V¢) 2 + ~m2¢2 + V(¢)].

show  later  that  we  can  not  construct  a  consistent  formulation  for  scalar 
fermions  with  anti-commutation  relations.  Calculating  the  commutator 
[¢(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)]  of ¢(x, t)  with Gt,  we  have 

[¢(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)]  =  ifr. 

Comparing Eq.  (2.114)  with Eq.  (2.81a), we  can see that 

ao¢  =  1r  =  -i[¢(x, t), Gt(ir, ¢)]. 

(2.114) 

(2.115) 

Using commutation relations Eq.  (2.81b),  we  have 

fr  =  -i[fr(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)]  =  (\72

- m2)¢(x, t)- V'(¢). 

(2.116) 

In deriving Eq.  (2.116),  we  have used the relation 

[fr(x, t), \7' ¢(x', t)]  = V''[fr(x, t), ¢(x', t)]  = -i\7' 83 (x- x') 

(2.117) 

and also an integration by parts.  Neglecting the interaction term and com(cid:173)
bining  Eqs.  (2.115)  and  (2.116),  we  find  that  the  field  operator  for  free 
scalar bosons satisfies the following  equation 

(2.118) 

Eq.  (2.118)  is  called the  Klein-Gordon  equation. 

The derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation is based only on the causal(cid:173)

ity principle and the covariance principle.  It should be noted that if we  use 
the  anti-commutation  relations  for  ¢ and fr,  we  get  [¢(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)]  = 0. 
Gt  given by Eq.  (2.113)  can not be the generator of time translation in this 
case.  Therefore,  the  Lagrangian Eq.  (2.111)  can only  be  used  to  describe 
the scalar bosons. 1 

2.3.3  Solutions  of the  Klein-Gordon  equation 

Eq.  (2.118)  is  a  wave equation.  Thus we  have the particle-wave duality for 
the scalar bosons.  We can solve the operator equation (2.118)  by expanding 
¢(x, t)  with respect to a  basis.  We  usually use the set of plane waves 

up(x)  =  Npeip·x 

for  solving the wave equations.  Then we  have 

<f,(x, t)  =  j d3pNpe;p·xap(t), 

(2.119) 

(2.120) 

1 One can also  use microcausality to prove that only the boson  field  can be used in the 
Lagrangian  Eq.  (2.111)  (W.  Pauli,  Phys.  Rev.  58,  716  (1940);  M.  Fierz,  Helv.  Phys. 
Acta 12, 3  (1939)).  But here we consider that microcausality is just a  result of causality 
principle.  One  can  prove  that  the  microcausality  is  satisfied  by  the  scalar  boson  field 
with the Lagrangian  Eq.  (2.111).

Then the basis expansion Eq.  (2.120)  becomes 

¢(x, t) =I d3pNp[a~l)ei(p·X-wpt) + a~l)t e-i(p·x-wpt)]. 

Denoting a~1)  simply by aP,  we  have 

¢(x, t) =I d3pNp[apei(p·X-wpt) + abe-i(p·X-Wpt)]. 

(2.124) 

(2.125) 

(2.126) 

Because fr = ¢,  the basis expansion of the conjugate field  is  given  by 

7r(x, t)  =  -i I d 3pNpwp[apei(p·X-wpt)- abe-i(p·x-wpt)J,

The commutation  relations  Eqs.  (2.128)  and  (2.129)  for  iip  and at  in  the

The functions up ( x, t)  are c numbers and commute with the field operators. 
We  have

2.3.5  The  homogeneity  of spacetime 

2.3.5.1  Noether  current 

Now we use the symmetry principle that demands the homogeneity of space(cid:173)
time.  The  action  should  possess  the  symmetry  of spacetime  translation. 
We  transform the  field  via  ¢(x)  ---+  ¢(x- a),  where  av  is  a  constant  four(cid:173)
vector.  For  an infinitesimal translation 8av,  ¢(x)  ---+  ¢(x)- 8av8v¢(x),  we 
have  8¢(x)  =  -8av8v¢(x).  If we  make  an  infinitesimal  change  ¢(x)  ---+ 
¢(x) + 8¢(x)  in  the  field  function,  we  have  .C(x)  ---+  .C(x)  + 8£(x),  where 
8£(x)  is  given  by the chain rule, 
8£(x) 

8£(x) 

8(£(x)) =  8¢(x) 8¢(x) + 8(81t¢(x)) alt8¢(x). 

(2.147) 

Taking 8/ 8¢(x)  as  a  functional derivative,  we  have

When  we  transform  the  fields  with  an  infinitesimal  spacetime  transla(cid:173)

2.3.5.2  Conservation  of energy-momentum 

The  action should  possess  the symmetry of spacetime  translation.  Under 
an infinitesimal spacetime translation, the variation of the action should be 
zero.  We  have  6S  =  0.  Then from  Eq.  (2.154),  we  have the  conservation 
of energy-momentum 

af.Le~(x) = o. 

(2.155) 

Eq.  (2.155)  is  the Noether's  theorem  for  the case of the symmetry of space(cid:173)

Now  we  look at the physical meaning of 8~. We  define

Po  is  defined as the energy of the field  ¢ and is  also called the Hamiltonian 
of the  field.  When we  replace  the  field  function  ¢  with the  field  operator

i8tir  =  [ir, fi]. 

Eq.  (2.163)  is  called  Heisenberg's  equations  of motion. 

According to Eq.  (2.159),  we  have 

[Po, Gt]  =  o. 

We  can see that Eq.  (2.162)  is  consistent with Eq.  (2.159).

the  vacuum  energy Eo  is  divergent.  Because  physical  observables  involve 
energy differences rather than the absolute value of the energy, the divergent 
zero-point  energy  Eo  can  be  dropped  out.  Then  the  Hamiltonian  can  be 
rewritten as 

H =  ii- Eo  =  j d3pwPabaP.

In the Hamiltonian Eq.  (2.170),  the creation operator is  on the left  of the 
annihilation  operator.  We  call  this  arrangement  of operators  as  normal 
ordering  or  normal product.  We  denote a  normal product of the operators 
A and B by : AB :.  Thus Eq.  (2.170)  has the form

Therefore, the momentum operator Pk  is the generator of space translation. 
Using  Eq.  (2.83),  we  have

eiPixi fr(xo, to)e-iPixi  = fr(xo  + x, to). 

(2.178a) 

(2.178b) 

Thus eiPixi  is  the operator of space translation.

2.4  The  complex scalar  field 

2.4.1  Lagrangian  of the  complex  boson field 

We  have  discussed  the  scalar  boson  field  with  one  component.  This  field 
describes  the  simplest  boson  particles.  The  equation  of  motion  for  the 
field  is  the  Klein-Gordon  equation.  For  the  scalar  boson  field  with  one 
component,  there is  a  problem in  its  solution Eq.  (2.125)  of the equations 
of  motion.  The  terms  corresponding  to  the  annihilation  operator  a(x, t) 
and creation operator at (x, t)  are complex, which is  not consistent with the 
properties  of particles  without  internal  degrees  of freedom.  This  problem 
can  be  solved  by  introducing  the  complex  scalar  field  with  the  internal 
degrees  of freedom.  The equations  of motion  for  the  complex  scalar  field 
have the solutions with the real annihilation operators ai(x, t)  and creation 
operators aJ (x, t).  We consider the scalar boson field  with two components. 
This field  is  equivalent  to the complex  field  ¢ =I  ¢*,  which  corresponds to 
a  doublet of particles and antiparticles. 

The  covariant  Lagrangian  density,  which  is  a  real-valued  function, 

should be given by 

£  =  8¢*  8¢  - m2¢*¢ 
' 

8xf1  8xf1 

(2.180) 

where ¢  and ¢*  can be treated as  independent fields.  This can be seen by 
transforming ¢  and ¢*  into two  real field  functions  ¢1  and ¢2  with 

¢1  = ~ [¢ +¢*], 

¢2  =- 01¢-¢*]. 

(2.181a) 

(2.181b) 

Then  we  can  go  to  the  real  valued  fields  and  use  the  same  procedure  to 
derive Gt  as in the last section.  These two kinds of particles have the same 
mass  m  and  the  Lagrangian density exhibits  an internal  symmetry under 
phase transformation. 

¢' =  ¢e-ia, 
¢*' = ¢*eia 

(2.182a) 
(2.182b) 

with real phase a.  The complex scalar boson field  is important because it is 
the basic  constituent to construct  boson fields  with the SU ( N)  symmetry 
and we  can add interaction terms with other types of fields  with the gauge 
invariance. 

Quantum  Fields 

33 

We  have  shown  that  the  symmetry of spacetime  translation  is  related 
to  the  conservation  of energy-momentum.  In  the  following,  we  will  show 
that any continuous symmetry transformation such as  Eq.  (2.182)  leads to 
a  conserved quantity. 

2.4.2  Symmetry  and conservation  law 

Suppose  we  have  an  infinitesimal  transformation  defined  by  the  transfor(cid:173)
mation in coordinates 

x'M  = xM  + 8xM 

(2.183) 

and the transformation in  the field  ¢a ( x) 

¢'a(x') = rPa(x)  + 8¢a(x). 

(2.184) 
If the transformations Eqs.  (2.183)  and (2.184)  leave the action integral 
invariant,  we  say that  the  system  possesses  the  symmetry defined  by  the 
transformations  Eqs.  (2.183)  and  (2.184).  We  introduce  a  variation  that 
keeps the value of the coordinates x  fixed 

8¢a(x)  =  ¢'a(x)- rPa(x). 

(2.185) 
8¢a(x)  is  also  called  the  total  variation,  while  the  variation  8¢a(x)  = 
¢' a(x')  - ¢a(x)  is  called  the  local  variation.  The  two  types  of variations 
have the following  relation 

8¢a(x)  = ¢'a(x)- ¢'a(x') + ¢'a(x')- rPa(x) 

= 8¢a(x)- (¢' a(x')- ¢' a(x)) 

=  8¢a(X)- OX: 8xM 

8¢' 

8¢a 

= 8¢a (x)  - oxM 8xM. 

(2.186) 
In the derivation of Eq.  (2.186),  ~~!1  is  approximated by ~ because their 
difference contributes only higher order terms.  According to the definition 
Eq.  (2.185),  we  have 

(2.187) 
Thus J commutes with differentiation  8~,.. .  The symmetry transformation

Eq.  (2.199)  is  called  Noether's  theorem,  which  states that each continuous

Then

2.4.3  Charge  conservation 

For the complex scalar boson field,  the Lagrangian density has an internal 
symmetry under the transformation Eq.  (2.182).  The infinitesimal form  of 
the transformation Eq.  (2.182)  is  given by 

¢'(x) = ¢(x)- ia¢(x), 
¢*'(x) = ¢*(x) + ia¢*(x), 

(2.202a) 
(2.202b) 

where  a  is  an  infinitesimal  parameter.  It is  conventional  to  scale  the  in(cid:173)
finitesimal  parameter a  out of the current j. 

Noether's  theorem  for  this  continuous  symmetry transformation  leads 

to a  conserved quantity we  now  call the charge 

Q  = j d3 xj"(x) = -i j d3 x (a~¢¢- 8~~. ¢') 
= -i J d3x(¢*¢- ¢¢*) = i J d3x(¢*86¢).

2.5.1  Lagrangian 

Now we  turn to another way of constructing the covariant Lagrangian.  We 
use  Eq.  (2.106)  directly without  carrying out the  integration over  1r.  The 
Lagrangian  contains  only  linear  time  derivative  term.  Dirac  had  found 

Quantum  Fields

out  the  covariant  form  for  this  type  of Lagrangian  in  a  genius  way.  The 
covariant Lagrangian density has been found  to  be 

(2.204) 

where  we  have  omitted  the  prime  '  for  the  Lagrangian  in  Eq.  (2.204)  to 
simplify  the  notation  and  use  the  conventional  '1/J,  instead  of¢,  to  repre(cid:173)
sent  the  field  function  for  the  spinor  field.  The  field  function  '1/J  has  four 
components  and  satisfies  the  transformation  laws  of  a  relativistic  spinor. 
(J-L  = 0, 1, 2, 3)  are the four 

The  adjoint  spinor  is  defined  as  if;  = '1/J t ,a.  11-1 

Dirac's matrices,  satisfying the algebra 

and 

1at  =  1a, 
,it = _,i. 

(2.205) 

(2.206a) 
(2.206b) 

We  have also introduced a and (3  defined  by (3 =,a and a= ,a,.  A set of 

objects obeying the  relations  Eqs.  (2.205)  and  (2.206)  is  said  to construct 
a  Clifford  algebra. 

According to Eq.  (2.104),  we  have 

and 

(2.207) 

(2.208) 

Eq.  (2.207)  gives  1r  = i'l/J t.  Since  1r  and  '1/J  should  be  independent  field 
functions,  '1/J  should not be a  real function.  Similar to complex scalar field, 
we  need two  independent  real field  functions  ¢ 1  and ¢ 2 .  We  define 

1 

'1/J  = J2(¢1 + i¢2), 
7/1'  = ~(¢, - i¢2). 

(2.209a) 

(2.209b) 

Then  we  have  two  independent  complex  field  functions  and  we  can  treat 
'1/J  and  1r  = i'I/Jt  as  independent  fields.  This  is  why  the  wave  functions  of 
electrons are complex functions.

Principles  of Physics 

2.5.2  The  generator  of time  translation 

The spinor '1/J  and '1/Jt  =  -i1r are treated  as  independent  fields,  each having 
four  components.  Using  Eqs.  (2.204)  and  (2.207),  Eq.  (2.208)  for  9t 
becomes 

9t  =  '1/Jt(-ia · V + (3m)'l/J 
=  1r( -a· V- ij3m)'l/J. 

(2.210) 
Transforming '1/J  and 1r  in  Eq.  (2.210)  into  operators,  we  get  the generator 
of time translation 

Gt(fr, ~) =  j d3xfr( -a· V- ij3m)~, 

(2.211) 

which  does  not  contain the time  derivative  term  and  fulfills  the  causality 
principle. 

2.5.3  Dirac  equation 

For  the  spinors  with  internal  variables,  when  we  write  out  the  indices 
explicitly,  the commutators Eqs.  (2.64)  and  (2.65)  become

Eq.  (2.217).  Multiplying  Eq.  (2.215)  by  ')'0  =

(2.221) 
which  shows that the eigenvalues  of the matrix ')'0  are  ±1  and those of /'i 
are  ±i.  In  order  to  be  consistent  with the  condition  that  the eigenvalues 
of 1°  are  ±1  and  those  of  /'i  are  ±i,  we  take  1°  as  hermitian  and  /'i  as 
anti-hermitian.  This  selection  is  consistent  with  the  condition  that  the 
Hamiltonian operator is  hermitian  and  has  real  eigenvalues,  which  can  be 
seen easily when we  obtain the Hamiltonian for  Dirac fermions  later. 

Eq.  (2.205)  also gives 

')'0  =  ')'i')'O')'i, 
')'i  = -')'0/'i/'0. 

Taking the trace on both sides of Eq.  (2.222),  we  obtain

which leads to 

Tr 1p,  =  0. 

(2.224) 

The trace of a  matrix is  the sum of its eigenvalues.  Tr 1p,  =  0  means that 
1°(1i) shall have as many eigenvalues of +1( +i) as those of -1( -i) so that 
the sum  of them  is  zero.  Therefore,  the order  N  of the  matrix 1p,  should 
be an even number.  For N  =  2,  we  have the unit  matrix

as  a  set  of independent  basis.  However,  they are  not enough to  construct 
1p,.  Thus the smallest  possible  order is  N  =  4.  There are  16  independent 
4 x 4 matrices.  The representation of 1p,  in 4 x 4 complex matrices is  called 
the spinor representation and correspondingly '1/J  is  the column matrix with 
four  components, which is  called the  Dirac  spinor. 

2.5.5  Dirac-Pauli  representation 
The 16  independent  matrices ri can be constructed using 1p,  and the unit 
matrix I  in  the following  way.  We  consider  all  the possible ways  of multi(cid:173)
plying 1p,  together.  Since ( 1p,) 2 is equal to + 1 or -1, we need only consider 
the  multiplications  1p,1v,  1p,1v 1>..  and  1p,1v 1>..1p  with  J-L  #- v  #- A  #- p. 
There is  only one product of four  matrices,  which we  denoted  as 1 5 

1 5 anti-commutes with 1p,  (J-L  = 0, 1, 2, 3), 

15 :=  i10111213. 

(2.227) 

(2.228) 

There are four  different  products of three gamma matrices.  They are 1f.1>15 
(J-L  = 0, 1, 2, 3).  Since 1p,  anti-commutes with each other, we  have six prod(cid:173)
ucts of two gamma matrices 

Together with the unit  matrix and four 1p,,  we  have the complete set of 16 
matrices

tion  which has the form

'Y  =  0  -I  ' 

(2.231) 

In this representation, 1° is  diagonal.  There are also  other representations 
which  are equivalent  to each other.  If we  choose 1 5  as  diagonal matrix,  it 
is  called the  Weyl  representation. 

Comparing Eq.  (2.206)  with Eq.  (2.222),  we  have 

Thus the hermitian conjugate of CJp,v  is

2.5.6  Lorentz transformation for  spinors 

Now  we  consider the  covariance of the spinor  fermion  Lagrangian density 
in  Eq.  (2.204). 2 

A Lorentz transformation is  expressed as 

(2.240) 

The spinor  fermion  Lagrangian density  and  Dirac  equation  should  be  co(cid:173)
variant for  any Lorentz transformation.  Since Dirac equation is  linear, the 
transformation relation between 1/J'(x')  and 1/J(x)  should be linear.  Then we 
have 

1/J' (x')  =  S(A)'lj;(x ), 

(2.241) 

where S(A)  is  a  4 x 4 matrix.  The components form of Eq.  (2.241)  is given 
by 

Covariance requires 1/J'(x')  to  be a  solution of the Dirac equation. 

(i"'(IL8'1L- m)'l/J'(x')  =  0. 

Multiplying the Dirac equation Eq.  (2.218)  from  the left  by  S 

S(i'"'!ILa/L- m)'lj;(x)  = S(i'"'!1La/Ls- 1S- m)'l/J(x) 
= (iS"'(~LS- 1 8/L- m)'l/J'(x') 
= ( iS"'(IL s- 1 AI/ /La' 1/  - m )1/J' (x') 
=  0. 

Comparing Eq.  (2.244)  with Eq.  (2.243),  we  have 

s1/L s- 1 AI/ /L  = 1v. 

(2.242) 

(2.243) 

(2.244) 

(2.245) 

Eq.  (2.245)  can be rewritten as 

s- 1"'(/L s =  AIL v'"'/1/. 

(2.246) 
2The reason that  Dirac demanded rJ.L  obeying Eq.  (2.205)  is  as  follows:  Since it  is  not 
easy to see directly that the Dirac equation is covariant,  it is  natural to do some trying. 
Multiplying the operator  (irJ.LaJ.L  + m)  on the Dirac equation gives 

-(rJ.LfVQJ.LOV  + m2)7j;  =- [~(rJ.LfV + fVfJ.L)OJ.LQV  + m2]  7./J  =  0. 

(2.238) 

If rJ.L  obey Eq.  (2.205),  Eq.  (2.238)  becomes 

(8J.Lf)J.L  + m 2)7j;  = 0, 

(2.239) 

which  is  Lorentz covariant.

(2.265) 
which  shows  that  {;?j;  is  a  scalar.  Similarly  we  can  show  that  1[;,~-t'lj;  is  a 
Lorentz vector.  Using  Eqs.  (2.246)  and  (2.263),  we  have

In addition to the scalar {;?j;  and Lorentz vector  1[;,~-t'lj;,  we  can  also  define 
pseudo scalar and  pseudo vector related to the spatial reflection. 
A spatial reflection is  defined  by the following  transformation 

x'=-x, 
t' = t. 

(2.267a) 
(2.267b) 

The corresponding transformation matrix is 

A~-t  =  (~ - ~  ~  ~) 

v 

0  0 -1  0 
0  0  0-1 

. 

(2.268) 

The  spatial  reflection  is  one  of the  improper  Lorentz  transformation 
because  it  can  not  be  generated  by  means  of infinitesimal  rotations.  We 
denote the corresponding spinor transformation S (A)  as P  ( P is  for  parity). 
According to Eq.  (2.246),  we  have 

p-1,~-t p  = A~-t vrv· 

Comparing with Eq.  (2.268),  we  have 

Av 1-£  =  TJv W

It  should  be  noted  that  there  is  no  summation  on  the  right  hand  of 
Eq.  (2.273).  The solution of Eq.  (2.273)  for  P  is 

p  =  eir.p,.l, 
p-1 =  e-ir.p"'-/, 

where 'P  is  a  phase factor.  Using Eq.  (2.232),  we  have 

pt = e-ir.p,l = p-1. 

(2.27 4a) 
(2.27 4b) 

(2.275) 

The explicit  form  of the spinor transformation under the spatial reflection 
is  given by 

'!j;'(x', t)  = '!j;'( -x, t)  = P'lj;(x)  = eir.p1°'1j;(x, t). 

(2.276) 

Using Eq.  (2.274),  we  have

or 

(2.277) 

(2.278) 

For a  proper Lorentz transformation,  S (A)  contains only a f-ll/.  We  note 
(2.279) 

/J-l/5 + /J-l/5  = ilf-l/0/11213 + ii0/11213/J-l = 0, 

which  leads to 

[r5,(jf-ll/l  =  2[r5(lf-lll/ _lVlf-l)- (lf-lll/ _lVlf-l)r5l = 0.

Since  S (A)  contains only a f-ll/,  we  have

(2.281) 

which gives 

(2.282) 
Combining Eq.  (2.278) with Eq.  (2.282), we see that 1 5  behaves as a pseudo 
scalar.

2.5.9  Energy-momentum  tensor  and Hamiltonian  operator 

The  action should  possess  the symmetry of spacetime  translation.  Under 
an infinitesimal spacetime translation, the variation of the action should be 
zero.  We  have  88  =  0.  Then similar  to  the  derivation  of Eq.  (2.154),  we 
have the conservation of energy-momentum 

With  the Canonical energy-momentum tenSOr  ef1V  given by 

Using  Eq.  (2.284),  we  get the conserved energy-momentum vector 

The time component of this vector is  the energy

When we  replace  the  field  functions  1/J  and 1/J t  by the operators -0  and 

-0 t, we  get the Hamiltonian operator 

(2.287) 

Using  Eq.  (2.207)  and  replacing  the  field  functions  by  the  corresponding 
operators, we  can see that Eq.  (2.287)  becomes Eq.  (2.211).  Therefore, the 
generator of time translation Gt  is  the Hamiltonian operator  fi.

2.5.10  Lorentz invariance 

Since  the  action  is  a  scalar  due  to  the  covariance  principle,  the  action 
as  a  scalar  is  invariant  under  Lorentz  transformation  (see  Eq.  (A.20)  in 
Appendix A).  Under an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation, we  have 

(2.290) 

and 

(2.291) 
Under  an  infinitesimal  Lorentz  transformation,  8S  =  0.  According  to 
Eq.  (2.198),  we  have the conserved current

where  we  have  omitted  the  derivative  term  containing  8~~,5~~)  because  it 
is  zero.  Since  8wv>..  is  antisymmetric,  the  last  term  in  Eq.  (2.292)  can  be 
written as 

8JLv8Wv>.X>..  = ~8wv>..(8JLvX>..- 8~-t>..Xv ). 

Thus Eq.  (2.292)  becomes 

j!L(x)  = ~8wv>.. M~-tv>..(x)

equivalently S =  0 for  scalar bosons. 

2.5.11  Symmetric  energy-momentum  tensor 

Noether's theorem leads to conservation law.  The density and currents ob(cid:173)

Also the total energy and momentum are not affected by the transformation 
Eq.  (2.304). 

Pv  = J d3xT2

(2.307) 
Since x,..,11 v  is  antisymmetric,  x00 v  =  0.  Also  we  use  Gauss's theorem  and 
neglect the surface integral terms.  Then we  obtain

The transformation Eq.  (2.304)  allows us  to construct a symmetric energy(cid:173)

which can be achieved in the following way.  Since 5wv>.  is any antisymmetric 
tensor, the equation of continuity Eq.  (2.199)  can be written as 

811M 11v>.  = 0. 

M11v>.  in  Eq.  (2.295)  can be written as 

M 11v>.(x)  =  811>-.xv  _  811vx>.  + ~ 11v>._ 

We  introduce 

(2.310) 

(2.311) 

(2.312) 

Since x""I1V  is  antisymmetric in its fist  two indices,  r""11V  is  antisymmetric in 
its  last two indices.  Thus we  have

Since  ~KILl/ is  antisymmetric in its last indices,  we  can set 

Then 

Using Eq.  (2.313),  we  have 

Inserting Eq.  (2.311)  into Eq.  (2.310),  we  obtain

Thus T~Lv given by Eq.  (2.317)  is  the symmetric energy-momentum tensor. 

2.5.12  Charge  conservation 

The  Lagrangian  density  of  Eq.  (2.204)  has  an  internal  symmetry.  It  is 
invariant  under  the  phase  transformations  '1/J  --+  '1/Jeix  and  'ljJ t  --+  'ljJ t e-ix. 
This  leads  to the conserved current-density j IL  in  a  similar way that  leads 
to the charge of complex scalar bosons.

commutator Eq.  (2.359)  and get

Eo  is  the energy of vacuum,  which  is  unobservable  and can  be subtracted 
from the Hamiltonian.  The physical vacuum is defined to be the state which 
contains neither particles nor  antiparticles

which  means  that  each  particle created by  z;t (p, s)  or antiparticle  created 
by dt (p, s)  carries a  momentum p. 

2.5.16  Spin  state 

We consider the operator 1 57ft,  where n  is an arbitrary space-like unit vector 
(nf-lnf-l  = -1) being orthogonal to the four-momentum vector p,  i.e. 

(2.367) 
In the  rest  frame,  p  =  0.  Eq.  (2.367)  gives n°  =  0.  Then n  · n  =  + 1. 
We  take the  z-axis  of the rest  frame  to be in  the  n  direction.  Thus  nf-l  = 
(0, 0, 0, 1).  In the standard representation of the 1  matrices, we  have

u(p, s)  =  w1(p), 
u(p, -s) = w2(p), 
v(p, s)  = w3(p),

2.5.17  Helicity 

In terms of u  and v,  Eq.  (2.375)  takes the form 

p 

:E  ·IPiu(p, s)  =  su(p, s), 

(2.384a) 

p 

:E  ·IPiv(p, s)  =  -sv(p, s ). 

(2.384b) 
with  s  =  ±1.  We  call  ~ :E  · &!  the  helicity  operator for  a  spin  ~ particle. 
Eq.  ( 2. 384) shows that u (p, s)  and v (p, s)  are the eigenstates of the helicity 
operator.  The eigenvalues of the helicity operator are ±~. 

The eigenstates with the positive ( h  =  + ~) helicity are called the right(cid:173)
handed  states  and  those  with  the  negative  ( h  =  - ~)  helicity  are  called 
the  left-handed  states.  When  the  spin  is  oriented  opposite  to  the  direc(cid:173)
tion of momentum, we  get the opposite helicity.  Thus u(p, 1)  and v(p, -1) 
(or  equivalently  u( -p, -1)  and  v( -p, 1))  are  right-handed  states,  while 
u(p,-1)  and  v(p,1)  (or  equivalently  u(-p,1)  and  v(-p,-1))  are  left(cid:173)
handed states. 

2.5.18  Chirality 
r5  is  called  the  chirality operator.  Since  (r5 ) 2  =  1,  the  eigenvalues  of 1 5 
are ±1.  The eigenstate of r5  with eigenvalue of+ 1 is said to have a positive

Since "(5 [(1 +"!5)?/J]  =  (1 +'Y5)?j;  and "(5 [(1-"(5)?/J]  =  -(1-"(5)?/J,  (1 ±"f5)?j;

2.5.19  Spin  statistics  relation 

It should  be  noted  that  if  we  use  the  commutation  relations  for  bosons, 
through  the  similar  deduction  for  Eq.  (2.359),  the  commutation  relation 
ford and  Jt  becomes  [d(p, r), Jt (p', r')]  =  -brr'63 (p- p'),  which  gives  a 
wrong sign.  It seems  that one can change d into  creation operator and  Jt 
into annihilation operator to eliminate the wrong sign problems.  However, 
it would  make ~ contain only annihilation operators and ~ t  contains only 
creation operators which contradicts with the definition of~ and ~t given 
by Eqs.  (2.62)  and  (2.63).  Thus spinor particles can only be fermions. 

There are also the positive-definite problem for  the Hamiltonian opera(cid:173)

tor if we  use the commutation relations for  bosons.  Hamiltonian 

fi =  L I d3pwp[bt(p,s)b(p,s) -dt(p,s)d(p,s)] 

s 

(2.386) 

can  not  be  transformed  into  a  positive-definite  operator  by  reordering  d 
and Jt, which  is  unphysical in some sense. 

2.5.20  Charge  of spinor particles  and  antiparticles 

From  Eq.  (2.209),  we  can  see  that  both  spinor  particles  and  antiparticles 
are composite.  We  will  show that they carry the opposite charge. 

The  charge  of  the  particles  and  antiparticles  can  be  calculated  using 

Eq.  (2.322).  The conserved charge is  given by 

Q =I d3xj 0 (x)  =  e I d3x?j;t ?j;.

of -e.  Their charge are opposite. 

2.5.21  Representation in terms  of the  Weyl  spinors 

We  have seen that the Dirac spinor field  1/J  with four  internal variables can 
be decomposed into two fields with two internal variables, the left hand field 
1/JL  = 1/2(1 - 1 5)1/;  and the right  hand  field  1/JR  = 1/2(1 + 1 5)1/;.  We  have 
1/J  = 1/JL  + 1/JR·  Using the Weyl  spinors,  the kinetic  term in the Lagrangian 
density Eq.  (2.204)  can be expressed as 

If we consider only the kinetic term and do not include the mass term which 
is similar to the interaction term, the Lagrangian density Eq.  (2.204) can be 
expressed as a summation of the terms, having the same form  as that using 
Dirac  spinor  field  functions,  contributed  by  the  two  types  of independent 
Weyl spinor field  functions 1/JL  and '1/JR·  All the derivations for  Dirac spinor

fields  can  thus  be  similarly  applied  to  the  Weyl  spinor  fields.  Using  the 
Weyl  spinor  fields,  the  mass  term  in  the  Lagrangian  density  Eq.  (2.204) 
can be expressed as 

(2.391) 

The  mass  term  describes  the  interaction  between  the  left  hand  field  '1/JL 
and  the  right  hand  field  '1/J R.  Therefore,  the  mass  term  should  also  be 
considered as the interaction term.  The Weyl spinor fermions  are the more 
basic particle units.  The Dirac spinors have the order N  =  4.  The spinors 
with  the  order  N  >  4  can  be  consider  just  as  the  composite  of the  Weyl 
spinors or Dirac spinors. 

2.6  Vector  bosons 

Now we consider the vector fields.  First we turn to the massive vector field, 
which is  simpler than the massless vector field. 

2.6.1  Massive  vector bosons 

2.6.1.1  Lagrangian 

There  is  a  possibility  of  constructing  covariant  Lagrangian  defined  in 
Eq.  (2.107)  by  using  vector  field.  The only  possible covariant  Lagrangian 
density for  massive vector fields  without interaction term is  given by 

where A11  is  a  vector function  in spacetime.

is  equivalent  to  the  Lagrangian  density  in  Eq.  (2.392)  because  it  can  be 
shown that 811 AJ.L  = 0 (Eq.  (2.416)) for the field described by the Lagrangian 
Eq.  (2.392).  We  add a  term -~(811 A11) 2 to the Lagrangian in  Eq.  (2.392).

In the derivation of the last line  of Eq.  (2.395),  we  have omitted the term 
~aJ-t[Av(av A~-L)-(avAv)A~-t] because it is a four-divergence and does not con(cid:173)
tribute to the action integral.  Thus the Lagrangian density in Eq.  (2.394)  is 
equivalent to the Lagrangian density in  Eq.  (2.392).  One may put a  factor 
f(AJ-LAJ-t)  before  FJ-tvp~-tv.  But  this  factor  can  be  merged  into  the  metric 
9~-tv  when we  use the curved spacetime.

space and construct a  four-dimensional vector A~-t  in the following  way.

usually used.  Using  notation A,  we  write Gt  as 

G,  = j d3x~ [1r2  + (V x  A?+ m 2 A 2  + ~2 (V · 1r)2

2.6.1.3  Deriving  the  Lagrangian from  Gt 
Now  we  prove  that  Gt  in  Eq.  (2.396)  leads  to  the  Lagrangian  given  by 
Eq.  (2.392).  We  have  three  internal variables  for  the  field  operators,  The 
commutators for  the vector boson field  are 

[¢i(x, t), frj(x', t)]  =  i8ij83 (x- x'), 
[¢i(x,t),¢j(x',t)] =  [fri(x,t),frj(x',t)] = 0. 

(2.402a) 

(2.402b) 

We  have  used  the  commutation  relations  for  bosons.  If we  use  the  anti(cid:173)
commutation relations for  fermions,  similar to the scalar field,  we can show 
[¢i, Gt]  =  0.  Then we  can not obtain an equation of motion from Gt.  Thus 
the vector fields  can only be  boson fields. 

We  will  show that after carrying out the integration over 1r,  we  can get 

a  covariant Lagrangian.  From Eq.  (2.401),  we  have 

We  also  define 

E =  - V Ao  - BoA. 

B =V X  A. 

We  can express Lagrangian density £  in terms of E  and B 

£  = ~(E2- B2) + ~m2(A6- A2).

we  have 

The  divergence  term  V  · (EA 0 )  has  been  dropped  out  because  it  yields

2.6.1.4  The  equations  of motion 
Using  the  generator  of time  translation  Gt  given  by  Eq.  (2.396),  we  can 
obtain  the  equations  of  motion.  Using  Eq.  (2.81)  and  V  x  V  x  A  =

polarization vectors that plays a similar role  as  the unit spinors u  and v  in 
the plane-wave decomposition  of the spinor  field.  In  the four  polarization

define the polarization vectors with respect to the direction of wave vector 
k.

2. 6 .1. 7  The  polarization  vectors 

Without  losing  generality,  we  demand  that  the  polarization  vectors  are 
orthonormal, satisfying 

We  select two space-like transverse polarization vectors 

with the condition 

and 

E(k, 1)  =  (0, e(k, 1)),

We  choose  the  third  polarization  vector  A  =  3  to  be  in  parallel  to  the 
direction of the wave vector k.  To specify the zero component of E(k, 3), we 
impose the condition that the four-vector  E(k, 3)  is  orthogonal to the wave 
four-vector  k,

Apparently,  E(k, 0)  is  orthogonal to the other three space-like polariza(cid:173)

is  given  by

Eq.  (2.426)  is  a tensor equation.  Thus we  need only show that Eq.  (2.426) 
holds in the rest frame because a transformation would generalize it to any

In the rest  frame  of the particles,  the only nonzero component of k~-L  is

2.6.1.10  The  spin  operator 

Now we discuss the angular momentum tensor for vector bosons.  The action

The transformation of a four  vector AJ.L  is  given  by

We can also use the general form of an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation

Comparing Eq.  (2.461)  with Eq.  (2.462),  we  have 

&wa~ [~w~t" -1)0~1)~"]  =  o.

Since  8waf1  is  antisymmetric,  we  can  choose  (Iaf1tv  to  be  antisymmetric 
for  a  and (3,  i.e.  (Iaf1)J.Lv  =  -(Jf1atv because the symmetric part cancelled 
out  after  contraction with  the  antisymmetric  8waf1·  Thus  the  solution  of

Principles  of Physics 

In  Eq.  (2.474),  the  summation  does  not  contain  the  longitudinal  polar(cid:173)
ization  term  (l  =  3)  because  €(k,  3)  and  e(k, 3)  is  parallel  to  k.  For  the 
transverse  polarizations  (l  =  1, 2),  €(k, 
l)  =  e(k, l).  Since  the  terms  with 
a-kl'akl  and a~kl'a~1  in  Eq.  (2.472)  change their  signs  when we  exchange 
the labels l f--t  l'  and k  f--t  - k,  they vanish.  Thus only the terms containing 
a~zakl'  (l, l' =  1, 2)  remain. 

We  choose  the  unit  vectors  e(k, 1)  and  e(k, 2)  in  such  a  way  that  the 
1~1  form  a  right-handed  orthogonal 

unit  vectors  e(k, 1),  e(k, 2)  and  ek  =

and  all the other commutation relations  are zero.  Thus ak+,  ak- and aka 
are  the  annihilation  operators,  while  a~+' a~_ and  a~a are  the  creation

The quanta created by ata  are called the circularly polarized particles with 
the  energy  Wk  and  momentum  k.  Thus  the  quanta created  by  at+  have 
the helicity of + 1 and those created by at_  have the helicity of -1.  Since 
the spin  projection in  the direction  of momentum  is  ±1  for  the  circularly 
polarized quanta, the vector  bosons  are spin  1 particles. 

Since  both  scalar  bosons  and  vector  bosons  have  integer  spin  while 

spinor fermions  have  half-integer spin,  one  may summarize the spin statis(cid:173)
tics relation as follows:  The particles with integer spin are bosons and those 
with half-integer spin are fermions. 

We  can also  define the circular polarization vectors  (also called helicity

ever,  for  massless  particles  (m = 0),  this method fails,  which leads to some 
difference.  We  can  not  construct  the  Lagrangian  - i Fllvpllv  in  a  similar

The commutation  relations  for  the operators ak>..  and  at>..  follow  from  the 
commutation relations of All and frl-l. 

(2.485) 

(2.486) 

In order to remain covariant form,  we  need to choose the artificial compo(cid:173)
nent of operators All and frl-l  to satisfy the following commutation relations. 

[AI-l(x,t),frv(x',t)]  =  -iryllv83 (x'-x), 
[AI-l(x, t), Av(x, t)]  =  [frl-l(x, t), frv(x, t)]  = 0. 

(2.487b) 
The commutation relation for  A0 (x, t)  has the wrong sign.  The commuta(cid:173)
tion relation for  ak)..  and at)..  then becomes 

(2.487a) 

(2.488) 

Quantum  Fields 

81 

Covariant form in Eq.  (2.487)  is crucial to get the factor El-l(k, A')EJ.l(k, A)  in 
Eq.  (2.488),  which enables us  to use the orthogonality relation of the four(cid:173)
dimensional polarization vectors El-l(k, A')EJ.l (k, A)  = 7]>..>..'.  Thus we  have 

and 

(2.489) 

(2.490) 

The operators ako  for  the  polarization  A =  0 satisfy the  commutation  re(cid:173)
lation  with the wrong  sign.  Wrong  sign  will  cause  problem  if one  tries to 
construct the Fock space for  ako.  The norm of one-particle state is 

\lkllk) = (Oiakoa~0 IO) 

= (OI( -77oo63 (k'- k) + a~oako)IO) 
=  -7]oo63 (0)\0IO). 

(2.491) 
Thus  the  norm  of the  state  for  the  A = 0  case  is  negative.  The  number 
operator  for  A =  0  obtain  a  wrong  minus  sign  nko  =  -a~0 ako,  which  is 
inconsistent  with  that  the  particle  number  should  be  positive.  This  also 
leads  to  a  wrong sign  in  the Hamiltonian operator fi =  - J d3 kwka~0ako. 
Therefore,  we  can not  construct  a  covariant Lagrangian for  massless  spin-
1  bosons  with  three  components.  However,  we  can  construct  a  covariant 
Lagrangian for  massless  bosons  with  two  components.  Since  we  have  two 
artificial components, one with positive sign and one with negative sign, we 
can manage them to cancel out each other. 

2.6.2.2  Faddeev-Popov  method 

We  consider  the particles with two  internal degrees  of freedoms.  We  have 
A1  and  A2 .  We  introduce  two  artificial  variables  A0  and  A3  in  order  to 
construct  a  covariant  Lagrangian.  Then  we  integrating  out  the  artificial 
variables  and  leave  only  A1  and  A2  variables  using  the  Faddeev-Popov 
method.  We  start with the covariant Lagrangian density 

L = _!pJ.lVpl-lv 

4 

(2.492) 

There are four  variables  and we  need  to integrate out the redundant vari(cid:173)
ables.  It should be  noted that the covariance should be maintained in the 
integration of the  redundant  variables.  We  note  that  there  is  a  transfor(cid:173)

mation  Al-l  -+  Al-l- 81-lA = AJ.l(A)  leaving the Lagrangian invariant.  Thus 

82 

Principles  of Physics 

we  factor out the redundancy by the integration over A using the Faddeev(cid:173)
Popov method.  We  first  define 

Then 

[~(A)r 1 = 1 nAb[J(A(A))J. 
~(A) I DAb[f(A(A))]  =  1. 

(2.493) 

(2.494) 

(2.495) 

Now  we  consider the path integral 

Z  =  I  DAeiS(A). 

We  can multiply ~(A) J DAb[f(A(A))] on the right side of Eq.  (2.495)  and 
get 

Z =I DAeiS(A) ~(A) I  DAb[f(A(A))] 

=IDA I  DAeiS(A) ~(A)b[f(A(A))]. 

(2.496) 

We  change  A  ---+  A( -A) = A+ 81-lA,  which  is  equivalent  to  A( A)  ---+  A. 
Z  =  J DA J DAeiS(A)  is  invariant with this transformation.  We  have also 

~(A(A)) =~(A- 81-LA) 

=  [! DA'6[f(A(A' + A))]l-

1 

=~(A). 

(2.497) 

Then Eq.  (2.496)  becomes 

Z  =  (IDA) I  DAeiS(A) Ll(A)6[f(A)]. 

(2.498) 

The integrand does  not depend on A and the factor  (j DA)  can be thrown 
away in Eq.  (2.498).  We  then choose  j(A) =  8A- a,  where a is  a function 
of x.  Eq.  (2.493)  becomes 

[~(A)r 1  =I DA6(8J-lAfk- 82A- a} 

(2.499) 

Since ~(A) is multiplied by b(f(A)) in Eq.  (2.498)  and we use ~(A) only in 
evaluating Eq.  (2.498),  we  can set f(A) = 8/kAJ-L- a = 0 in Eq.  (2.499)  and 
get  ~(A)- 1  =?  J DAb( 82 A).  It  can  be  seen  that  ~(A) does  not  depend 
on  A.  Thus  we  can  throw  ~(A) away  in  Eq.  (2.498).  Since  Z  does  not 

Quantum  Fields

depend on CJ,  we  can integrating Z  with an arbitrary functional of CJ  which 
we  choose as 

(2.500) 

where~ is  a  parameter.  Thus we  have 

Z  = J Duexp [-2i~ J d4xu 2 (x) l J DA exp(iS(A))J(BMAM- u) 
= J DAexp [iS(A)- 2i~ J d4x(8MAM) 2

]. 

(2.501) 

From Eq.  (2.501),  we  can see that the original action S(A)  is  replaced  by 

Correspondingly we  have the new  Lagrangian density

(2.503) 

It  should  be  noted  that we  have  used  the symmetry that the action  S 

is  invariant with the transformation 

(2.504) 

in the construction of the Lagrangian of the massless vector bosons, which 
can  be  seen  from  the  derivation  of Eq.  (2.498).  Eq.  (2.504)  is  called  the 
gauge  transformation.  The symmetry that the action  S  is  invariant under 
the  gauge  transformation  is  called  the  gauge  symmetry.  Since  the  La(cid:173)
grangian for  the massless vector bosons is  gauge-invariant, we  also  call the 
massless vector bosons as  gauge  bosons.  The gauge symmetry is a condition 
imposed on the derivation of the covariant Lagrangian for  the massless vec(cid:173)
tor bosons.  Therefore the  interaction terms of the  massless  vector  bosons 
with other particles should also have the gauge symmetry.  This is  why the 
gauge symmetry plays the important role to unify the different interactions. 
Since  mass  term breaks the gauge transformation  A11  ---+  A~ = A11  - 811A, 
we  can  not  have  massive  bosons with two  components.  For  vector  bosons 
with only one components, there are three virtual components and the way 
to construct  a covariant Lagrangian has  not  been found.

2.6.2.3  Coulomb  gauge 

Since  the  action  is  invariant  for  the  gauge  transformation  Ap,  --+  A~ = 
Ap,  - Bp,A,  we  can take A~ =  A 0  - 80 A  =  0.  Therefore,  with  proper gauge 
transformation,  we  can take  A0  =  0.  The  action  is  also  invariant  for  the 
transformation  Bp,A~t --+  Bp,A'I-l  =  Bp,A~t - a.  We  can take  Bp,A~t = 0  with 
proper  choice  of a.  Then  V  ·A =  0.  This  is  called  the  Coulomb  gauge. 
The  massless  vector  bosons  have  only  two  internal  degrees  of  freedoms. 
The  Coulomb  gauge  V  · A  =  0  means  that  the  longitudinal  component 
vanishes and the two transverse components are not zero.  Thus we have the 
massless vector bosons with two transverse freedoms  and add two artificial 
variables,  one  is  the  longitudinal  component  A 3  =  0  and  another  is  the 
fourth  component  A0  =  0.  We  have  initially  the  following  commutation 
relations 

(2.505a) 

[Ai(x, t), frj(x', t)]  = i6ij63(x- x'), 
[Ai(x, t), Aj(x', t)]  = [fri(x, t), frj(x', t)]  = 0 

(2.505b) 
with i, j  = 1, 2.  After introducing the third artificial variable, we have avec(cid:173)
tor A with three components,  which  are not  independent  and constrained 
by V  · A = 0.  We  have only two  independent  transverse components.  We 
could use the transverse projection operator P1_  to impose the transversality 
condition.  P 1_  is  defined  by 

A 

(Pl_)ij  = 6ij- ai 

(2.506) 
Then we can impose V ·A = 0 by acting on Ai with the projection operator 
pl_ 

aj.

We  can  change  the  commutation  relations  to  the  projected  commuta(cid:173)

commutation relation Eq.  (2.505a)  becomes 

(2.507) 

(2.508) 
with i,j =  1, 2, 3.  6iij(x- x')  is  the transverse delta function  defined  by

Besides the Coulomb gauge V ·A= 0 with A0  =  0,  which is  also called 
the radiation gauge, we  can choose other gauges.  We  have two functions  A 
and a  to determine A 0  and  A 3  using  A 0  =  80 A  and  8J.LA~t =a.

2.6.2.4  Gt  of massless  vector bosons 
We  can show  that  the  following  generator of time  translation Gt  leads  to

Gt  =  j d3x~ [* 2 + (V x  A) 2

(2.510) 

which  contains  no  time  derivative  and  satisfies  the  covariance  principle. 
We  introduce  the  four  dimensional  vector  AJL  with  V  · A(x, t)  =  0  and 
A0 (x, t)  =  0.  The  Lagrangian  density  in  Eq.  (2.503)  becomes  the  La(cid:173)
grangian density given  by Eq.  (2.492).  We  then define  the  electric  field  E 
by 

We  also  define

E =-at- VAo. 

B =V X  A.

B  is  called  the  magnetic field.  In the radiation gauge,  we  can express the

After carrying out the integration over 1r  in Eq.  (2.107), we can see that Gt 
in  Eq.  (2.510)  leads to the Lagrangian given  by Eq.  (2.492).  The massless 
vector  bosons described  by the Lagrangian density in  Eq.  (2.513)  are also 
called  photons. 

2.6.2.5  The  equations  of motion for  massless  vector  bosons

Thus the photons are spin  1 particles. 

2. 7 

Interaction 

By now,  we  have only considered the Lagrangian without interaction.  The 
interactions can be added into the Lagrangian without violating the causal(cid:173)
ity  principle  when  they  contain  no  time  derivatives.  Since  any  terms  in(cid:173)
volving  field  function  1r  in the generator of time  translation Gt  for  bosons 
will  give terms related to time derivative,  the interaction terms for  bosons 
should  not  contain  1r.  The  physical  mass  and  interaction  terms  should 
achieve the lowest energy for  the ground state when the temperature effect 
is  small.  By  now,  we  have  no  good  numerical  methods  to  calculate  the 
ground state in the Riemann spacetime.  However, we  know that symmetry 
plays  an  important  role  in  the  ground  state.  Generally,  the  ground  state 
should  have  high  symmetry.  Some  symmetries  are  related  to  the  Lorentz 
covariance.  These  symmetries  should  always  be  guaranteed when  we  add 
mass  and interaction terms.  In these  symmetries,  the most  important one 
is  the  gauge  symmetry,  which  correlates  different  types  of particles.  We 

Quantum  Fields 

89 

have shown that the Lagrangian containing the massless boson field  should 
possess the gauge symmetry in order to fulfill the covariance principle in the 
previous  section.  Therefore,  any  Lagrangian  contains  the  massless  boson 
field  should have the gauge symmetry.  We will discuss the gauge symmetry 
in the following  section. 

2. 7.1  Lagrangian with the  gauge  in variance 

We  can  couple  the  vector  bosons  with  the  spinor  fermions  by  adding  an 
interaction term  eAJ.L {ryJ.L'!jJ.  The  Lagrangian for  a  spinor  fermion  field  in(cid:173)
teracting with a vector field  reads

Then Eq.  (2.530)  can be rewritten as  follows:

(2.534) 

The gauge transformation Eq.  (2.531)  makes  FJ.Lv(x)  -+  FJ.Lv(x),  which 
means  that  the  Lagrangian of photons  is  invariant.  The  Lagrangian den(cid:173)
sity  in  Eq.  (2.530)  possesses  the  symmetry  of  gauge  invariance.  From 
Eq.  (2.532),  we  can  see  that  A(x)  and  A(x) + 27r  give  exactly  the  same 
transformation.  The gauge transformation U = eiA(x)  in Eq.  (2.532)  forms 
the  abelian  group  U(1)  because  A(x)  is  a  simple  function  of  spacetime 
coordinates.

2.7.2  Nonabelian  gauge  symmetry 

The  transformation  can  be  generalized  to  the  nonabelian  case  where  Al-l 
is  composite.  In  the  gauge  transformation  '1/J(x)  -t U'lj;(x),  U  can  be  an 
element  of  SU ( N)  with  ut U  =  1,  which  guarantees  the  term  '1/J t '1/J  for 
scalar field  or i/;'1/J  for  fermion  field  to be invariant.  This generalization was 
introduced by Yang and Mills  in  1954. 

Similar to the abelian case.  We introduce the gauge covariant derivative 
Dl-l  =al-l- igAI-l  to replace the ordinary derivative al-l,  where g is called the 
coupling constant.  Under the transformation 

we  have 

'1/J(x)  -t U?jJ(x), 

(2.535) 

(2.536) 

Then  we  have  an  invariant  kinetic  term  Df.l'I/Jt Dl-l?jJ  for  scalar  boson  field

The Lie  algebra of group gives the commutation relations

Spacetime 

3.1  Lagrangian  in the Riemann spacetime 

Now  we turn to the curved spacetime.  In order to fulfill  the causality prin(cid:173)
ciple,  the physical spacetime should be the Riemann spacetime as discussed 
in  the  Appendix  A.  The  action  should  satisfy the  principle  of general  co(cid:173)
variance.  Thus,  the  action  S  is  a  scalar  in  the  Riemann  spacetime.  Let 
us  construct  the  Lagrangian  which  should  be  the  scalars  in  the  Riemann 
spacetime.  The  simplest  field  is  the  scalar  field.  We  consider  the  scalar 
field  as  an example.  The underlining  principle is  independent  of the types 
of the fields  contained in  the Lagrangian. 

Let  us  begin  with  the  Lagrangian of matter .Cm.  The general form  of 
the Lagrangian density of matter .Cm  with ¢2  term for  a  scalar field  in the 
Riemann spacetime is  given  by 

(3.1) 

where m  is the mass and V(¢)  is the self-interaction term.  g~-tv is the metric 
tensor in the Riemann spacetime.  g11v  can be a functional of the field  ¢ and 
its spatial derivatives.  It should  not  contain ¢.  If g~-tv  is  not  a  function  of 
¢,  all the procedure of constructing covariant Lagrangian in the Minkowski 
spacetime  can  be  applied  similarly to  the  Riemann  spacetime.  The  more 
general form  for  Eq.  (3.1)  is 

f( ¢) can be absorbed into the metric g~-tv because the metric g~-tv is the func(cid:173)
tional of the field  functions.  Therefore the Lagrangian density in Eq.  (3.2) 
is  equivalent  to  that  in  Eq.  (3.1).  We  will  only  consider  the  Lagrangian

density in Eq.  (3.1).  The action for  a scalar field  of matter in the Riemann 
spacetime is  given by 

For  a vector AJ-t,  we  should use  a  covariant derivative 

DaA~-t = 8aA~-t - r~~-tAv. 

where  r~J-t  is  the Levi-Civita connection of the metric given by 

f~v = ~gAP(8vgpJ-t + 8J-tgpv- 8pgJ-tv), 

(3.4) 

(3.5) 

The first  order covariant  derivative of a  scalar function  coincides  with the 
ordinary derivative. 

With the Lagrangian density of matter .Cm,  we  can define  the  energy(cid:173)

momentum tensor 

Using the energy-momentum tensor TJ-tv,  we  can also  construct a  scalar 

Be  = a1 J d4 xv=ggJ-tvTJ-tv

(3.8) 

where a 1  is  a  constant parameter.  This Lagrangian density can be consid(cid:173)
ered  as  a  part  divided  from  the  Lagrangian  density  of matter.  With  the 
metric g~-tv,  we  can construct a  scalar as  follows: 

S9  =  a2 j d4 xv=gR, 

(3.9) 

where a 2  is  a constant parameter.  R is the Ricci scalar curvature.  S9  is the 
so-called  Einstein-Hilbert  action  for  gravity.  R  is  defined  as  g~-tv RJ-tv.  RJ-tv 
is  the Ricci tensor defined by RJ-tv = R~""v·  R~v"" is  the Riemann curvature

discuss other terms later.  Now  we  consider the total action is  given  by the 
above three contributions.  If all the quantum fields  involved are considered 
in the matter Lagrangian density .Cm,  then the action St  contains all kinetic 
terms and the interactions. 

It should  be  noted  that we  do  not  consider  the  metric  g J-LV  as  an inde(cid:173)
pendent field.  gJ-Lv  is  a  functional  of field  functions  ¢a(x), gJ-Lv  =  gJ-Lv(¢(x)). 

3.2  Homogeneity of spacetime 

We  use the principle that the spacetime is  homogeneous.  The total action 
should  possess  the  symmetry of spacetime  translation.  We  transform the 
fields  via ¢a(x)  -t ¢a(x- a),  where al-l  is  a constant four-vector.  For an in(cid:173)
finitesimal translation, ¢a ( x)  -t ¢a ( x)- 8¢a ( x) with 8¢a ( x)  = -av 8v¢a ( x). 
Correspondingly,  we  have  y'-g.Cm ( x)  -t  J=9.Cm ( x)  + 8 ( J=9.Cm ( x)), 
where 8(J=9.Cm(x))  is  given  by the chain rule 

D( y'-g.Cm(x)) 

D( J=9.Cm) 

8( ~.Cm(x)) = 
We  also evaluate the functional  derivative  8!:0:), which gives 

D¢a(x) 

8¢a(x) + D(DJ-L¢a(x)) DJ-L8¢a(x).  (3.13)

where Sm  =  J d4yJ=9.Cm(Y)  is the action for  matter.  Thus 8( J=9.Cm(x)) 
has the form

When we transform the fields with an infinitesimal spacetime translation 
av,  we  have  <S(v=g.Cm(x))  =  -av8v(v=g£m(x))  =  -8v(av v=g£m(x)). 
Expressing  the  right  side  of Eq.  (3.15)  with  the  Noether  current  for  the 
energy-momentum 

(3.16) 

we  have 

o!~~) li¢a(x)  = FYD,,j~ = FYD,,(avT~"(x)). 

(3.17) 

Then the functional  derivative for  the total action St  becomes 
o:~tx) li¢a(x)  =  FYD~(avT~"(x)) + a,li(g~vFYT~") 

+ a26( .j=gR) + <5( .j=gA'). 

(3.18) 

The action should possess the symmetry of the spacetime translation.  U n(cid:173)
der  an infinitesimal  spacetime translation with <5¢a(x)  = -av8v¢a(x),  the 
variation of the total action should  be zero.  We  have 

(3.19) 

Here we  demand <58=  0 for  a specific variation <5¢a(x)  = -av8v¢a(x) from 
an infinitesimal spacetime translation due to the homogeneity of spacetime, 
which  should  lead  to  the  conservation  of  energy-momentum.  Since  the 
current conservation is  valid in  all circumstances,  it should also hold in the 
Minkowski  spacetime  and  the  classical  case.  Eq.  (3.16)  gives  the  correct 
limit  for  the Minkowski spacetime and the classical case. 

In the Minkowskian action, the metric gf1v  is  constant.  We  do not have 
an equation to relate the matter field  with the geometric metric.  It seems 
that the Minkowski metric has a symmetry of spacetime translation and we 
can have the conservation of energy-momentum.  However this is  true only 
when  background  is  vacuum.  Generally  we  have  inhomogeneous  matter 
distribution as  background.  When we  consider the transition amplitude 

we  find  that  the  symmetry of spacetime  translation  is  not  guaranteed  in 
the Minkowski spacetime for  the transition amplitude with inhomogeneous 
initial state ¢( x, 0).  When the initial state is inhomogeneous, any spacetime 

(3.20) 

Quantum  Fields  in  the  Riemann  Spacetime 

101 

translation will result a different initial state.  Thus the transition amplitude 
is  not  invariant  for  the time  translation in  the  Minkowski  metric.  This  is 
another reason that we  should use the Riemann spacetime. 

The conservation of energy-momentum is  given  by 

Therefore,  we  have 

Using the following  relation 

R  =  1: 4(3gJLv(RJLv + (3g1Lv R), 

(3.21) 

(3.22) 

(3.23) 

we  can write Eq.  (3.22)  in  a  more symmetric way, 

6 [ ( <>1 ..FijT~" + ~2:J (R~" + (3g~" R) + ~..FijA' g"") g~" l 

=  0. 

(3.24) 

3.3  Einstein equations 

Since  we  can  use  any  local  coordinate  frame,  gJLv  can  be  a  very  general 
function  and  we  expect  the terms  in  the  bracket  before  gJLv  in  Eq.  (3.24) 
cancel out except  for  a  constant term.  Thus we  have 

(3.25) 
where c is  a constant.  cgJLv  term can be merged with i A' giLl/  term and thus 
we  take  c  = 0.  Using  the  Bianchi  identity,  we  can  see  that  (3  = -1/2 in 
order  to  guarantee the  equation  of the  conservation  of energy-momentum 
Dp,TJLv(x)  =  0.  We  introduce the gravitational constant  G,  which  relates 
the parameters a1  and a2  by a1  =  -81rGa2.  Then Eq.  (3.25)  becomes 

1 

RILl/  - 2gjLl/ R  +giLl/ A =  -87rGTJLl/' 

(3.26) 

where A= 27rGA' /a1, which is call the cosmological constant.  Eq.  (3.26)  is 
called the  Einstein  equations  or  Einstein field  equations  of general relativ(cid:173)
ity.  Since the Einstein equations Eq.  (3.26)  guarantee both Eq.  (3.21)  and 
Eq.  (3.22)  to  be  satisfied,  Eq.  (3.19)  is  fulfilled  automatically.  Therefore, 
the homogeneity of spacetime is  guaranteed. 

102 

Principles  of Physics 

When we  put  back the Einstein equations into the total  action  St  and 
use  the  parameter  relation  a1  =  -81rGa2,  we  find  the  terms  Se  and  8 9 
cancel out.  Only the  action  Sm  for  matter  remains  in  the total action  St. 
Thus the action becomes 

(3.27) 

The  path  integral  for  the  action  of  Eq.  (3.27)  should  be  carried  out  for 
the field  functions  with the metric giLl/  in the action satisfying the Einstein 
equations  Eq.  (3.26).  Both  Tttv  and  giLl/  are  symmetric  for  the  index  J-l 
and  v.  There  are  10  independent  functions  for  gttv.  Thus  there  are  10 
equations  in  Eq.  (3.26).  Since  the  energy-momentum  conservation  equa(cid:173)
tions  Dp,Tttv(x)  =  0  are  satisfied  automatically.  We  have  6  independent 
equations  for  10  functions.  We  have  then  4  functions  to  make  coordinate 
transformation  for  gttv.  Thus  the  Einstein  equations  uniquely  determine 
the  metric  gttv  from  the  field  functions.  On  the  right  side  of Eq.  (3.26), 
Tttv  is  determined by Eq.  (3.6). 

3.4  The generator  of time translation 

We  will  show  that  the  following  generator  of  time  translation  gives  the 
action of Eq.  (3.27) 

(3.28) 

where  the  metric  gttv  is  only the  functional  of the  field  functions  ¢a:  gttv 
should not  contain the conjugate field  function  1r a  and the time derivative 
terms.  Thus the causality principle  could  be  guaranteed.  We  can get  the 
action of Eq.  (3.27)  by inserting Eq.  (3.28)  into Eq.  (2.107)  and integrating 
over  ?Ta.

Similar to the flat  spacetime,  we  can show that we  can not  construct a 
consistent formalism  for  the scalar fermions  which obey  anti-commutation 
relations.  Thus  we  consider  that  the  scalar  field  is  a  boson  field  that  Ja 
and fra  satisfy the commutation relation in Eq.  (2.60)  for  bosons.  Inserting 
Gt(fr, ¢)  in Eq.  (3.30)  into the commutator  [¢a(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)],we have

(3.36) 

(3.37) 

(3.38) 

Using Eq.  (3.37)  to express Po  in terms of fra,  we  have 

(3.39) 
Therefore the generator of time translation Gt  is  equal to the Hamiltonian 
operator fi and Eq.  (2.81)  becomes  Heisenberg's equations of motion. 

6t =if. 

In order to  calculate  the second  equation of motion,  we  need  to  know 
the relation of 9p,v(¢)  with the field  operator¢.  The relation of 9p,v(¢)  with 
the field operator¢ is  described by the Einstein equations Eq.  (3.26), which 
we  can not solve exactly. 

It should  be  noted  that  if  we  use  the  anti-commutation  relations  of 
fermions  for¢ and fr,  we  get  [¢(x, t), Gt(fr, ¢)]  = 0.  Gt  given  by Eq.  (3.28) 
can  not  be  the  generator  of time  translation.  Therefore,  the  Lagrangian 
Eq.  (3.2)  can only be  used to describe the scalar bosons. 

In  the  derivation  of the  Einstein  equations,  we  have  only  used  the  R 
term.  We  have  not  considered  the  high  order  terms  of  R  because  they 

Quantum  Fields  in  the  Riemann  Spacetime 

105 

involve  the  time  derivatives  of third  order on the  left  side  of the  Einstein 
equations  while  only  the  time  derivatives  of  up  to  the  second  order  are 
involved  on  the  right  side.  The  terms  contributing  the  third  order  time 
derivative should  be zero.  Thus the terms containing the high order terms 
of R  should vanish  and only the linear  R  term is  needed. 

The gravitational effects are mainly caused by the mass of particles and 
the  mass  effect  is  involved  not  only  in  the  range  of low  energy.  In  order 
to  calculate  the  gravitational  effect  in  a  general  way,  we  need  consider  a 
broad  range of energy spectrum.  This  poses  a  computational  difficulty  of 
gravitational  effect  due  to  the  failure  of ordinary  perturbation.  Because 
in  the  ordinary  perturbation,  when  we  consider  the  Minkowski  metric  as 
a  starting  metric  and  use  plane  wave  basis,  we  encounter  the  integral  of 
J d4 k  that is  integrated over the whole  range of energy.  Thus the ordinary 
perturbation calculations fail. 

3.5  The relations of terms  in  the total action 

Now let us consider the value of the parameter o:1 .  o: 1  can take an arbitrary 
value.  Since  the  action  with  o:1  has  the  similar  terms  as  the  action  for 
matter,  it  is  natural  to  choose  0:1  =  1/4,  which  gives  o:1 g~ =  1  because 
g~ = 4.  Then the total action becomes 

St  = J d4x-J=g.Ct 
= J d4x-J=g(.Cm + .Ci) 

with 

(3.40) 

(3.41) 

The  terms  in  .Ci  are  canceled  out  except  for  a  constant  term  due  to  the 
symmetry of spacetime  translation.  We  call  .Ci  the  invariant  Lagrangian. 
The invariant Lagrangian .Ci  plays the role of guaranteeing the conservation 
of energy-momentum.  In  addition,  we  find  that  it  implicates  a  symmetry 
of the  scale  invariance  for  the  total  action.  It can  be  seen  that  in  the 
total  action,  the  matter  Lagrangian  has  a  minus  counterpart  - .Cm ( x)  in 
the  invariant  Lagrangian.  Therefore  any  mass  and  interaction  terms  can 
be  canceled  out  without  changing the total action.  In the  second  term of 
Eq.  (3.40),  the  kinetic  terms  play  a  special  role.  Since  the  matter  action 

106

can  be  canceled  out,  the  remaining  action  related  to  matter  particles  are 
the following  action

Interactions 

Similar to the Minkowski spacetime, the interaction can be added into the 
Lagrangian.  Any terms involving  field  function  1r  in  the generator of time 
translation Gt for  bosons will give terms related to the time derivative.  The 
interaction terms generally should not  contain boson field  1r  except  for  the 
linear  term  of  1r.  Although  we  can  add  any  mass  and  interaction  terms 
without  changing the total Lagrangian,  the suitable form  of the mass  and 
interaction terms should  be  that which  achieves  the  lowest  energy for  the 
ground state when temperature effect  is  small.  Determination of the form 
of the  interaction  terms  that  achieves  the  lowest  energy  for  ground  state 
involves  the  calculations  of the  ground  state  in  the  Riemann  spacetime, 
which  is  difficult.  We  note that  a  sign  change of all  mass  and  interaction 
terms  is  equivalent  to  the sign  change  of kinetic  terms  and  thus  the  sign 
change of the gravitational constant G.  Therefore, the sign of G is  related 
to the ground state. 

Generally, the ground state should have high symmetry.  There are some 
symmetries which are related to the Lorentz covariance.  These symmetries 
should  always  be  guaranteed  when  we  add  interaction  terms. 
In  these 
symmetries,  the  most  important one  is  the gauge symmetry,  which  corre(cid:173)
lates different  types of particles.  We  have  shown that massless  boson field 
should possess the gauge symmetry.  Therefore,  any Lagrangian containing 
the massless boson field  should have the symmetry of gauge symmetry.  We 
can  couple  the  vector  bosons  with  the  spinor  fermions  by  adding  an  in(cid:173)
teraction term gAp,ifrp,'l/J,  where g is  the coupling  constant.  We  introduce 
the  gauge  covariant  derivative  Dp,  = Dp,  - igAp,  to  replace  the  spacetime 
covariant  derivative  Dp,  to  include  this  interaction  term.  For  the  kinetic 
term of the gauge  boson field  Ap,(x),  we  use  Fp,v  =  Dp,Av- DvAp,  for  the 
abelian gauge symmetry and use 

Fp,v  =  Dp,Av- DvAp,- ig[Ap,, Av]· 

(3.43) 
for the nonabelian gauge symmetry.  Then we have a gauge invariant kinetic 
term for  the Yang-Mills  Lagrangian

Since r~J.l =  r~a, the terms involving r~J.l canceled out and we do not need

similar way used  for  the case of the Minkowski metric in the section 2. 7.2.

4.1  Scale invariance 

4.1.1  Lagrangian with  the  scale  invariance 

Dilatation transformation on spacetime is  defined  by 

( 4.1) 
where,.\ is a real number.  With the change in coordinate scale x-+ x' = ..\x, 
if we  also  define  a  field  transformation of the form 

x-+ x' =  ..\x, 

(4.2) 

then the transformations Eqs.  ( 4.1)  and  ( 4.2)  are called the  scale  transfor(cid:173)
mation.  d¢  is  called the  scaling  dimension  of the field  ¢.  If the action  S  is 
invariant  with  the scale  transformations  Eqs.  (4.1)  and  (4.2),  we  say that 
the system has the symmetry of scale  invariance.  The Lagrangian without 
the mass terms and interaction terms has the symmetry of scale invariance, 
which we  call the plain  Lagrangian. 

For the d-dimensional space,  in  order to  maintain the scale  invariance, 

the field  transformation needs to have the following  forms. 

(i)  For scalar bosons, 

'P(x)-+ 'P'(x')  =  ,.\-2 'P(..\x). 

d-1 

(ii)  For spinor fermions, 

1/J(x)-+ 1/J'(x')  =  ,.\~1);(..\x). 

(iii)  For vector bosons,

With these transformation, we  have 

C(x)  --+  C' (x')  = Ad+l C(Ax)

and 

S =I dd+ 1xC(x)--+ I  dd+ 1xAd+l C(Ax)  =I dd+ 1x' C(x'). 

(4.7) 

d-1 

When S is  unchanged with the scale transformation, for  a Lagrangian with 
the gauge symmetry,  A 11  should be scaled as a11  because of the presence of 
the covariant derivative D11  = a11  -igAw  We have A-2- =A from Eq.  (4.5). 
Then d = 3,  which  means  only four-dimensional  spacetime can  have  both 
scale invariance and gauge invariance.  We  have shown that the action with 
massless vector bosons should be gauge invariant.  In the three-dimensional 
space,  when  we  add  gauge  interaction terms  to  the  plain  Lagrangian,  we 
still have the symmetry of scale invariance.  For other space dimension,  the 
symmetry  of the  scale  invariance  will  be  broken  when  we  add  the  gauge 
interaction terms. 

4.1.2  Conserved  current for  the  scale  invariance

Then the field  transformation is  expressed as

It is possible to eliminate the internal part ~P-in Eq.  ( 4.15) by redefining

Eq.  (2.315)

which  implies  that the scale invariance leads to the vanishing of the trace 
of the energy-momentum tensor. 

4.1.3  Scale  invariance for  the  total  Lagrangian 

The action given  by Eq.  (3.42)  has  a  symmetry of scale invariance.  When 
we  change  the  scale  of coordinates  x  ---+  x'  = 
.Ax  together  with  the  field 
transformations 

¢a(x)---+ ¢~(x') = A.¢a(A.x), 
'1/J(x)---+  '1/J'(x')  = A.3121jJ(A.x), 
AIL(x)---+  A~(x') = A.AIL(A.x),

( 4.27b) 

(4.27c) 

where  ¢a(x),  '1/J(x)  and  AIL(x)  are  the  scalar  boson  field,  spinor  fermion 
field,  and vector boson field,  respectively.  the Lagrangian .Cr  changes as 

Thus the action Sr  is  unchanged under the scale transformation, 

Sr  = I d4x~.Cr(x) 
--+I d4xF[J>.4Lr(Ax) =I d4 x'FiJLr(x') =Sr. 

( 4.28) 

( 4.29) 

Using Noether's theorem, the invariance of action leads to the conserva(cid:173)
tion law corresponding to the scale invariance, aiL(xvTILV)  =  Tt =  0,  which 
implies  that  scale  invariance  is  equivalent  to  the vanishing  of the trace of 
the energy-momentum tensor.  When we  put the Tj:  = 0  into the Einstein 

Symmetry  Breaking 

113 

equations,  we  have  R  =  0 if the  cosmological constant  is  zero.  The space(cid:173)
time will  have zero curvature for  a  system with the scale invariance.  From 
Eq.  ( 4.29),  we  can see  that only  four-dimensional  spacetime  can  have  the 
symmetry of scale  invariance.  Since the time can only be one-dimensional 
due to the causality principle, this might be one of the reason that the space 
dimension is  three-dimensional. 

4.2  Ground  state energy 

Energy  plays  an  important  role  in  physics.  The  energy  is  excited  over  a 
background to generate particles.  There are two special backgrounds which 
are important.  One is  the ground state, which is  the state having the low(cid:173)
est  energy  and  is  thus  the  state  with  the  highest  stability.  The  other  is 
the  vacuum,  which  does  not  contain  particles.  Each ground  state  has  its 
vacuum.  But  vacuum  is  not  necessarily  equivalent  to  the  ground  state. 
When the ground state does  not contain particles, the ground state is  then 
the same with the vacuum.  When the ground state contains  particles,  the 
ground  state is  not  the vacuum.  The universe  is  not empty.  Our universe 
consists  of various  types  of particles.  Because  our  universe  is  not  in  the 
temperature of zero,  we  do  not  know whether the ground state of our uni(cid:173)
verse is  a vacuum.  However,  in most  cases,  the universe can be considered 
almost  empty.  This  means that the ground state can be  approximated by 
the vacuum.  The ground state energy is  then equal to the vacuum energy 
approximately.  The  vacuum  energy  is  also  called  the  zero  point  energy 
because it is  related to 1 /2fiwp  in  the case without interactions of the par(cid:173)
ticles.  As  an  example,  we  calculate the vacuum  energy  of the  free  scalar 
boson field  in the Minkowski spacetime, which is  the expectation value 

Let  us  first  calculate 

(OI¢(x, t)¢(x, t)IO)  =  lim (OI¢(x, o)¢(o, O)IO)

=  V 

(4.32) 
We can see that the energy of vacuum is the integration of 1 /2wp over all 
momentum mode and over all space.  It should be noted that the integration 
over p  diverges.  However,  what matters is  the difference  of energy.  These 
could  be  (i)  the  energy  difference  of systems  with  and  without  particles; 
(ii)  the  energy  difference  between  different  vacuums  corresponding  to 
different  ground states. 

For the spinor fermions,  the energy of vacuum in the Minkowski space(cid:173)

time is  given  by 

(OIHIO)  =  (OI I d3p L Wp [ht (p, s )b(p, s)  - d(p, s )dt (p, s )]IO)

The  factor  2  comes  from  the  summation  of the  contributions  of particles 
and antiparticles,  such as,  electrons and positrons. 

Eq.  ( 4.35)  has  an  minus  sign  with  it.  The  spinor  fermion  field  has  a 
negative vacuum energy, while the scalar boson field  has a positive vacuum 
energy.  Since Wp  =  .jp2  + m 2  increases with the increase of m.  The mass 
of particles increases the vacuum energy.  A Lagrangian with positive mass 
term for  scalar bosons will  increase the vacuum energy.  The ground state 
should  have  the  lowest  energy.  Thus  we  can  only  add  a  negative  mass 
term, which means that we  can not give mass directly to the scalar bosons. 
Instead, we  need a negative mass term and then with a symmetry breaking 
to transform the negative mass term into  positive mass term,  which  is  the 
reason why we  need  Higgs  mechanism to generate mass for  particles.  The 
Higgs  mechanism will  be discussed  in the section 4.4. 

Symmetry  Breaking 

115 

4.3  Symmetry breaking 

When temperature is high, we have the state with high symmetry due to the 
entropy effect  (see  chapter of statistical mechanics).  When temperature is 
low,  the high symmetry state will transform into a state with lower energy, 
which  usually  has  lower  symmetry.  The symmetry  breaking  is  related  to 
the phase transitions of second  order and critical  phenomena.  It is  one of 
the most important physical mechanisms. 

Now  we  consider the Lagrangian 

1 

1  2  2  A  22 
£  = 28pJ/J8~¢- 2m  ¢  - 4(¢  )  , 

(4.36) 
( cp 1 , cp2 ,  ·  ·  ·  , cp N).  This  Lagrangian  corresponds  to  the  scalar 
where  cp  = 
bosons  with  mass  m  and  a  self-interaction  ~¢4 .  The  Lagrangian exhibits 
an O(N) symmetry under which  cp  transfers as anN-component vector and 
is  renormalizable.  We  can  add  a  term  that  does  not  possess  the  O(N) 
symmetry to break the O(N)  symmetry.  For instance, we  can add cpi¢2  to 
break the  0 ( N)  symmetry down  to  0 ( N  - 1).  However,  the  Lagrangian 
does  not  possess  the original  O(N)  symmetry  anymore.  There is  another 
way for  system to break the symmetry.  We  keep  the Lagrangian with the 
O(N)  symmetry,  but  the  ground  state  turns  out  to  be  a  state  without 
the  0 ( N)  symmetry.  This  phenomenon  is  called  spontaneous  symmetry 
breaking. 

4.3.1  Spontaneous  symmetry  breaking 

We  have explained that for  scalar bosons,  positive  mass  term leads  to the 
ground state with  higher energy.  Thus a  Lagrangian density with the cor(cid:173)
rect  ground state would  have the following  form 

£  =  ~8~¢8~¢ + ~J-l2¢l- ~(¢2)2. 

(4.37) 
We  have  changed  the  sign  of the  ¢ 2  term  in  Eq.  (4.36).  We  can  not 
just  say  that  the  field  has  the  particles  with  mass  FJli =  iJ-l,  which  is 
meaningless.  ~(8i¢) 2 - ~f-l2¢ 2 + ~(¢ 2 ) 2  is  the  potential  term.  We  notice 
that  ¢  = 0  is  not  the  position  of the  minimum  for  the  potential  term.  It 
is  the  maximum  position.  The  minimum  is  at  ¢  =f  0.  Now  we  determine 
the  minimum  of the  potential  term.  Clearly,  any  spatial  variation  in  ¢ 
will  increase the energy.  Thus we  set  ¢(x)  to be a  constant quantity ¢ 0  in 
spacetime and  look for  the minimum of potential.  We  define 

V(¢)  = -~J-l2¢2 + ~(¢2)2.

Physics is  equivalent  for  the two cases.  When the nature made the choice, 
the reflection symmetry ¢-+ -¢of the Lagrangian is  broken.  It is  broken 
spontaneously.  We  can choose  either two  ground states.  So  we  choose the 
ground state at +v and write ¢ = v + ¢'.  We  expand £  in ¢'  and we  have 

( 4.40) 

Now we  have a positive mass term for  the shifted field¢'.  The particles 
corresponding to the field¢' with mass J2J-L.  The first term is the constant 
term,  which will  contribute to the cosmological constant. 

4.3.2  Continuous  symmetry 

The case  N  ~ 2 is  different  with  N  =  1.  For  N  =  1,  the symmetry is  the 
reflection  symmetry¢-+  -¢.  It is  a  discrete  symmetry with one symme(cid:173)
try transformation.  For  N  ~ 2,  we  have  an  infinite  number  of symmetry 
transformations  with  continuous  parameters.  We  call  it  continuous  sym(cid:173)
metry.  For N  =  2,  the shape of the potential is  shown in Fig.  4.2.  We  have 
the  0(2)  symmetry  in  the  Lagrangian.  The  potential  has  the  minima  at 
4>2  =  J-L2 I>-.,  which  corresponds  to  an  infinite  number  of equivalent  vacua

characterized  by  the  direction  of¢.  We  can  choose  any  one  of them  and 
others are the same with it.  So  we  choose the one with the direction of¢ 
to be in  1 direction.  In this case,  ¢ 1  =  v = jJli]). and ¢ 2  =  0. 

Now  we  express the field  functions  as the  fluctuations  around the vac(cid:173)
uum.  We  have ¢ 1 =  v + ¢~ and ¢2  =  ¢~ and put them into the Lagrangian 
density in Eq.  ( 4.37).  The Lagrangian density becomes 

( 4.41) 

In  Lagrangian density given  by  Eq.  (4.41),  the  particles  generated  by the 
field  ¢i  have  a  mass  v'2J.-l.  However,  the  field  ¢~ is  massless  due  to  the 
absence of ¢~ 2  term.  The emergence of the massless  boson field  ¢~ comes 
from  the  symmetry  of  vacuum.  The  potential  along  the  bottom  of  the 
potential takes the same values.  ¢~ is  the field  along the bottom.  It costs 
no addition energy to go around the potential bottom.  The mass of particles 
is  zero  for  the  field  ¢;.  The  massless  field  ¢;  is  called  N ambu- Goldstone 
bosons  or  Goldstone  bosons.  For  N  > 2,  we  have the similar results.  After 
symmetry  is  broken,  the  system  has  the  ground  state  with  one  massive 
boson and N  - 1 N ambu-Goldstone bosons.

4.4  The  Higgs mechanism 

We  know that scalar bosons can achieve a positive mass term through sym(cid:173)
metry breaking from  a  negative mass  term with  self-interaction.  Through 
interaction between different types of particles, other particles can also be(cid:173)
come  massive  by  the  symmetry  breaking  of the  scalar  boson  field.  This 
mechanism is  called the  Higgs  mechanism. 

We  consider the simplest  case:  the charged scalar field  (complex scalar 
field)  with the local U ( 1)  gauge in variance coupled with the massless vector 
bosons.  The vector  boson term is  given by  -iFJ.LvFJ.Lv.  We  add the inter(cid:173)
action term  e2 AJ.LAM¢*¢  with the gauge  invariance.  Then the  Lagrangian 
density is  given by 

£  = -~FJ.LvFJ.Lv + ~[(8J.L- ieAJ.L)¢*][(8f-L + ieAJ.L)¢]

The Lagrangian is  invariant  under the local  abelian gauge transforma-

The resulted Lagrangian now describes a massive boson field  interacted 
with two scalar boson fields,  the massive ~ and massless x fields.  It should 
be noted that the gauge bosons have only two independent transverse com(cid:173)
ponents before the symmetry breaking.  The third component (longitudinal 
component)  has been gauged out by 8f.l-Af.L- CJ  =  O(with  CJ  taken to be zero 
here).  Now  longitudinal component  A3  can be nonzero  because the vector 
bosons  become  massive.  We  shall  use  the  gauge transformation  to  gauge 
out  another component. 

Since  the  Lagrangian does  not change with  any choice  of the transfor(cid:173)

mation function  B(x)  in  Eq.  (4.43),  we  can choose 8(x)  to be equal to the

( 4.53) 
All  massless  particles  become  massive  particles  through  the  Higgs 
mechanism. 

If there is no gauge interaction term, the complex massless scalar bosons 

become one massive boson and one massless Goldstone boson in the sponta(cid:173)
neously broken symmetry.  When there is  a gauge interaction term between 
the  vector  bosons  and  scalar  bosons,  the  vector  bosons  acquire  mass  at 
the  expense  of the  would-be  Goldstone  bosons.  Vector  bosons  with  two 
components  become  massive  vector  bosons  with  three  components  while 
Goldstone  boson  disappears.  This  Higgs  mechanism  can  be  applied  simi(cid:173)
larly to the non-abelian gauge bosons.

4.5  Mass and  interactions of particles 

The mass terms generally are not added purely as an self-interaction term. 
If we  add  the  mass  term  as  an  self-interaction  without  interaction  terms 
between  different  types  of  particles,  these  massive  particles  will  become 
dark  matters.  However,  the  mass  of  particles  can  be  generated  through 
interactions  by  the  Higgs  mechanism.  It  is  reasonable that  the  favorable 
interaction terms are those possessing the scale invariance, which maintain 
the  symmetry of the  scale  invariance  in  the  total  Lagrangian.  The  inter(cid:173)
action terms included in the standard model of electroweak unification are 
those possessing the scale invariance. 

The gauge group in the standard model is  U(1) 0  SU(2),  for  which the 

gauge invariant Lagrangian density for  the gauge bosons  has the form

Invariant  commutation relations 

We  have  solved  the  equations  of motion  for  free  fields.  In  order  to  treat 
the quantum fields  with interactions, we  will  develop some tools which  are 
useful  for  the calculations of quantum fields  in this  chapter. 

The commutation relations Eqs.  (2.60)  and  (2.61)  are the commutation 
relations  between  field  operators  at  two  different  spatial  positions  but  at 
equal time.  Using the equations of motion,  we  can calculate the commuta(cid:173)
tion  relations  between  field  operators  at  different  times.  One of the  most 
important  commutation  relations  is  the  invariant  commutation  relation, 
which  possesses the Lorentz invariance. 

5.1.1  Commutation functions 

In  the  following,  we  consider  the  scalar  boson  field  as  an  example.  For 
scalar  bosons,  we  define  the  invariant  commutation  relation  between  the 
field  operators ¢(x, x 0 )  and ¢t (y, Yo)  as 

iL.(x- y) = [¢(x), ¢t (y)]. 

(5.1) 

L.(x)  is  also  called  the  Pauli-Jordan  function.  We  have  used  the  homo(cid:173)
geneous  character  of spacetime  to  write  L.(x- y)  as  a  function  of x- y 
instead of x  and  y  separately.  It can  be seen  that  L.(x- y)  is  a  Lorentz(cid:173)
invariant function  from  the definition  Eq.  (5.1)  which  is  not dependent  on 
any specific  frame  of reference. 

For the free complex scalar field,  we can calculate the function  L.(x-y) 

easily.  The generator of time translation Gt  is  given  by

The sign of Po  does  not change under any Lorentz transformations because 
the time-like  momentum  vectors  with p0  >  0  always  keep  (p2  =  m 2  >  0) 
and thus always lie  in the forward  light cone while those those with p0  < 0 
are always in the backward light cone.  Thus 6(x- y)  is  Lorentz-invariant. 

We  can easily show that other commutation relations satisfy the follow(cid:173)

ing equations:

Since the field  operator ¢( x)  satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation

Eq.  (5.9).  In  fact,  Eq.  (5.18)  is  just the  equal-time  commutation  relation

5.1.2  Microcausality 

Eq.  (5.17)  leads to a  very important property of quantum field 

Li(x- y)  =  0, 

for  (x- y) 2  < 0. 

(5.20) 

The  invariant  function  Li(x- y)  vanishes  when  x- y  is  a  space-like  four 
vector.  Eq.  (5.20)  has  important  implication  that  two  observable  quanti(cid:173)
ties  can be  measured independently when the measurements take place at 
two  points  that  have  a  space-like  separation.  This  is  the so-called  micro(cid:173)
causality,  which states that disturbances can not propagate faster than the 
speed of light. 

In the  following,  we  will  give  a  deduction  that  Eq.  (5.20)  leads  to the 
microcausality of observables.  We  write the operator for  a local observable 
such as  PJ-L  as 

O(x)  =  ¢t (x)O(x)J;(x), 

(5.21) 

Perturbative  Field  Theory 

127 

where O(x)  is  a c-number function or a  differential operator.  The commu(cid:173)
tator of two observables is  given  by 

[O(x),O(y)]  =  O(x)O(y)[<P(x)¢(x),¢t(y)¢(y)] 
=  O(x)O(y){ ¢t (x)¢t (y)[¢(x), ¢(y)] 

+ ¢t (x)[¢(x), ¢t (y)J¢(y) + ¢t (y)[¢t (x), ¢(y)J¢(x) 
+ [¢t (x), ¢t (y)J¢(x)¢(y)} 

=  O(x)O(y){¢t(x)i~(x- y)¢(y)- ¢t(y)i~(y- x)¢(x)} 
=  O(x)O(y)(¢t (x)¢(y) + ¢t (y)¢(x))i~(x- y). 

(5.22) 

From Eq.  (5.20),  we  obtain the microcausality for  the scalar boson field. 

[O(x), O(y)]  = 0, 

for  (x- y) 2  < 0. 

(5.23) 

In  the  frame  that  two  space-like  points  x  and  y  have  the  same  time, 
O(x)O(y) or O(y)O(x) can be considered as two consecutive measurements 
made  within  an  infinitesimal  time  difference.  Eq.  (5.23)  means  that  the 
measurement  first  at  x  and  then  at  y  is  equivalent  to  the  measurements 
first  at y  and then at x  for  two space-like points x  andy.  Thus the observ(cid:173)
able 0  can be measured independently at two  space-like points. 

5.1.3  Propagator functions 

In addition to the function  ~ ( x- y), we can define other invariant functions 
for  the  operators,  the  so-called  propagator  functions.  One  of  the  most 
important  propagator  functions  is  the  Feynman  propagator  ~p(x - y), 
which is  defined  as 

i~p(x- y)  = (OIT¢(x)¢t (y)IO). 

(5.24) 

The symbol T  denotes the time-ordered product of the operators ¢(x)  and 
¢t (y),  which is  defined  by 

TA(x)B(y) = A(x)B(y)8(xo- Yo)± B(y)A(x)8(yo- xo), 

where 

8(x) = 

1, 
0, 

{ 

for  x  > 0 
for  x  < 0. 

The operator T  put the  factor  of two  time-dependent  operators A and  B 
into  chronological order that the operator having the later time argument 
is  put before the other.  ±sign in Eq.  (5.25)  occurs due to the reordering of 

(5.25) 

(5.26)

operators.  The plus(minus)  sign  is  for  the boson(fermion)  field  operators. 
In the case of the free  fields,  L,p(x- y)  is  also called the free  propagator. 
We  can  evaluate  the  Feynman  propagator  using  the  solutions  of  the 
equations of motion.  The solution Eq.  (5.4)  for  the complex scalar bosons 
consists of the following  parts

the function  Dp ( x - y)  is  the solution of the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon 
equation containing a delta function  as a source term.  The Feynman prop(cid:173)
agator  has  the meaning of amplitude  probability for  the process  in  which 
a  particle created  at the point  x 1 , h  in  spacetime  propagates to the point 
x 2 , t 2  where  it is  annihilated.  Since  field  operators ¢  and ¢t  contain  both 
the operators for  particles and  antiparticles,  Dp(x- y)  describes the pro(cid:173)
cesses  for  both  particles  and  antiparticles  depending  on  the  chronological 
order of¢ and ¢t. 

In  contrast,  the  commutation  functions  !::,(x- y),  t:,(+)(x- y),  and 

!::, (-) ( x - y)  satisfy the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation 

(5.34) 

where  Di = D, t:,C+),  and  t:,C-). 

In addition to !::,(x- y)  and Dp(x- y),  there are several other commu(cid:173)
tation  functions  and  propagator  functions.  For  the  propagator functions, 
in  addition to  Dp(x- y),  we  define  Dyson  propagator  as 
Dv(x) = 8(xo)t:,C-)(x)- 8(-xo)it:,(+)(x). 

(5.35) 

Dv(x)  is  also  known  as  anti-causal  propagator  which  has  an  opposite 
chronological order as  compared to the Feynman propagator. 

We  can  also  define  two  other  propagators,  the  retarded  propagator 

DR(x)  and the advanced  propagator DA(x). 

DR(x) = 8(xo)D(x), 
DA(x) = -8(xo)D(x). 

(5.36a) 
(5.36b) 

The  Pauli-Jordan function  !::, ( x)  can  be written  as  the  difference  between 
the retarded propagator and the advanced  propagator

(5.39) 

The propagator functions  L,p(x),  L,v(x),  L,R(x),  L,A(x)  and  LS,(x)  are 
the  solutions  of  the  inhomogeneous  Klein-Gordon  equation  with  a  delta 
function  as the source term 

(5.40) 
where  L,i  = L,p, L,D, L,R(x), L,A(x), Zi(x).  Since they are the solutions of 
the  inhomogeneous  Klein-Gordon equation with  delta function  source,  we 
also call them the Green's functions.  For example,  6p(x) is  also called the 
Feynman  Green's  function.  These  propagator functions  contain a  product 
of the  function  L,(x)  with  a  unit  step  function  in  time  such  as  8(xo)  or 
~E(x0 ).  The step function is the one leading to the delta function when the 
Klein-Gordon operator is  applied. 

5.2  n-point  Green's  function 

5.2.1  Definition  of n-point  Green's  function 

We  have calculated the Feynman propagator in the previous section, which 
is  shown  to  be  the  Green's  function  for  the  equations  of  motion.  The 
Green's  functions  are  also  called  the  correlation  functions.  They  are  the 
useful  tools  in  the  calculations of field  properties.  Now  we  generalize  the 
two-point  Green's  function  to the n-point  Green's  function  defined  as  the 
following  time-ordered product. 

(5.41) 
G(x 1 , x2 ,  ·  ·  ·  , xn)  is  also  called  the  n-point  correlation  function.  Similar 
to  the  two-point  Green's  function,  we  can  calculate  the  n-point  Green's 
function using the solution of the equations of motion.  Generally, the easiest 
way to calculate then-point Green's function  is  that uses the path integral 
formalism.  Similar  to  the  derivation  of  Eq.  (2.102),  we  can  express  the 
n-point time-ordered product as  a path integral.  Then-point time-ordered 
product, which is  also called the transition matrix element, has the form in 
the path integral formalism

5.2.2  Wick  rotation 

Now  we  consider the evaluation of the two-point  function 

We  can extract the correlation function  G(x 1 , x2) from  the transition  ma(cid:173)
trix  element  Eq.  (5.42)  in  the  following  way.  We  decompose  1¢)  into  the 
eigenstates  In)  of ii, which gives 

1¢, t)  =  eifit L ln)(nl¢)

Using the expansion of Eq.  (5.44),  we  have

= L (¢', t'ln') (n'IT[¢(xl)¢(x2)]1n) (nl¢) 

n,n' 

n,n' 

The term with  n'  =  n  =  0  in  Eq.  (5.45)  contains the correlation function 
G(x 1 , x2) .  The trick to exact the function  G(x 1 , x2)  from  Eq.  (5.45)  is  to 
damp out the terms with n' -=f  0 or n  -=f  0.  These terms have the oscillatory 
factor  e-i(End' -Ent).  We  can take the ground state Eo  =  0.  Thus one can 
introduce an exponentially damping factor  by attaching an imaginary part 
to the time  coordinate  by t'  ---+  r' e-ic5  and  t  ---+  re-ic5.  When we  take the 
limit  T  ---+  -oo and r' ---+  oo.  The terms with  n' -=f  0  or  n  -=f  0  are damped 
out.  Geometrically,  this  is  achieved  by a  rotation clockwise  with an  angle 
0  >  8  >  1r  in  the  complex  plane.  To  calculate  the  path  integral,  one  can 
start  from  any  0  >  8  >  1r.  In  terms  of the  new  rotated  time  coordinates 
T  = ei8t  and  r' = ei8t',  the limit  of the matrix element  has the form

Principles  of Physics 

In the last line  of Eq.  (5.46),  we  have  made an analytical continuation  by 
going to real values of the rotated time coordinate T.  This is a mathematical 
manipulation.  If the  integral  is  an  analytic  function  in  the  time  variable, 
this can also be considered as a procedure that we calculate the well defined 
limit in the last line of Eq.  (5.46)  and then make an analytical continuation 
to  <5  =  0.  Since one can choose  any 0 > <5  > 1r,  the most  convenient  choice 
is  <5  =  ~,  which  rotates  the  time  axis  into  the  pure  imaginary  direction.

To  make  the  notations  simpler,  we  generally  omit  the  lim  symbol  in

5.2.3  Generating functional 

In order to calculate the path integral in Eq.  (5.51), we define the generating 
functional  of a  field  by 

Using the generating functional,  we  can define  a  normalized functional

5.2.4  Momentum  representation 

For  a  free  field  or  perturbation  calculations  based  on  the  free  field,  it  is 
advantageous to work in the momentum space because the solutions of the 
equations  of  motion  for  the  free  field  can  be  expanded  using  plane  wave 
basis.  The  transformation  of the  Green's  functions  into  the  momentum 
representation is  defined  by 

G(p1,p2, · · · ,Pn)(2n) 484 (Pl + P2 + · · · + Pn) 

= J  d4x1  · · · d4xninG(xl, X2, ·  ·  ·  , Xn)e-i(p 1 ·x 1 +p2 ·x 2 +···pn·xn). 

(5.58) 

The  8-function  factor  comes  from  the  conservation  of energy-momentum 
due to  the translation invariance of spacetime.  After  evaluating the  right 
hand  side  of Eq.  (5.58),  there would  be  a  factor  84 (p1 + P2 + · · · + Pn)  on 
the right hand side of the equation so  that the factor 84 (p1 + P2 + · · · + Pn) 
would be canceled out. 

5.2.5  Operator representation 

We  introduce the operator functional  defined  by

5.2.6  Free  scalar fields 

For a perturbation calculation, we need define a reference field,  whose equa(cid:173)
tions  of motion can  be solved.  Generally,  we  take free  fields  as  base fields 
because the equations of motion for  free  fields  can be solved exactly.  Now 
we  consider the case of a  free  scalar field.  The connected generating func(cid:173)
tional for  the free  scalar field  is  given  by 

W[J] = J Dcpe-i J d4x[!¢(D+m2-iE)¢-J¢]_ 

(5.64) 

with  0  = 8J.L8J.L.  Here  we  have  performed  an  integration  by  parts for  the 
kinetic  term  in  the  Lagrangian  density  £  =  ~(8J.Lcp81-Lcp- m 2¢2 )  of a  free 
scalar field 

A  positive  infinitesimal  E  is  introduced in  accordance with  Eq.  (5.46).  An 
alternative method is  the Wick  rotation, which enable one to evaluate the 
path integral in the Euclidean space  (see  Appendix E). 

In order to calculate the generating functional,  we  introduce a  field  ¢0 

(5.65) 

satisfying the following  equation 
[0 + (m2

(5.66) 
We  take ¢0  as  a reference field  and shift ¢ with respect to ¢0 .  ¢ = ¢0 + ¢'. 
Then we  have

In the derivation of Eq.  (5.67),  we  have used  Eq.  (5.66). 

The solution of Eq.  (5.66)  is 

¢0(x)  =- j d4y~F(x- y)J(y),

which  is  the solution of the equation

(5.71) 

Dependence  of J  in  the  path  integral  is  contained  in  the  second  term  of 
Eq.  (5.71).  Thus 

Z[J] =I D¢e-i f d4x[~¢(D+m2 -iE)¢-J¢] 

=  Z[O]e-1 f d4xd4yJ(x)D..p(x-y)J(y). 

(5.72) 

Then  the  normalized  generating  functional  for  the  free  scalar  field  is 

given by 

Z  [J]  =  Z[J]  = e-1 f d4xd4yJ(x)D..p(x-y)J(y).

The subscript 0 is  used  to denote a  quantity of the free  field.

with  ~Fij  =  ~p(Xi - Xj)  and  Jk  =  J(xk)·  All  the  n-point  functions 
with  odd  n  vanish  because  Z  contains only  even  powers  of J  and  an  odd 
functional  derivative  leaves  an  odd  powers  of  J  in  the  integrand  which 
vanishes at  J  =  0. 

Perturbative  Field  Theory 

137 

For the even  powers of functional  derivatives of Zo,  we  have 

(5. 75) 

where  the  sum  runs  over  all  permutations  (Pl,P2, · · ·  ,P2k)  of the  number 
(1, 2, · · ·  , 2k).  Eq.  (5.75)  shows  that  the  n-point  functions  of free  scalar 
bosons  can  be  written  as  a  product  of two-point  functions,  which  is  the 
so-called  Wick's  theorem.  Wick's  theorem  thus  allows  us  to  calculate the 
n-point functions of the free fields  in terms of the Feynman propagator.  As 
an example, we consider the case of n  =  4,  which corresponds to k  =  2.  We 
have 

Go(x1,x2,x3,x4)  =  -8 L~FP1P2~Fp3p4· 

1 

p 

(5. 76) 

There are 24  terms in the sum.  Since  ~Fp1 p2  = ~Fp2p1 ,  ~Fp3 p4 = ~FP4P3, 
and  ~Fp1 p2 ~Fp3 p4  = ~Fp3 p4 ~Fp2p1 ,  we  obtain a  2 x 2 x 2 = 8 factor from 
4  = 3 distinct terms 
the sum, which just cancels with the factor 1/8.  Only  2
8
are left,  which can be written explicitly as 

Go(xl, x2, X3,  X4)  = -~p(xl - x2)~p(x3 - x4) 
- ~p(x1 - x3)~p(x2 - x4) 
- ~p(x1 - x4)~p(x2 - x3). 

(5.77) 

5.2.8  Feynman  rules 

We  can express the expansion in a graphical way using Feymann diagrams. 
The Feynman rules set up the connection between the algebraic and graph(cid:173)
ical  representation.  For the free  field,  they are given  by

( 4)  There  is  a  combinatorial  factor  for  each  diagram  that  takes  into

of Eq.  (5.79):  the  connected  graphs that  all  parts  are  tied  together,  such 
as  Fig.  5.4  for  iW0 [J],  and  the  unconnected  graphs  such  as  Fig.  5.5  for 
( i W0 [ J]) 2 .  The connected Green's function  defined  by  Eq.  ( 5. 57),  such as

Interacting  scalar  field 

We  can add any interaction term V ( ¢)  in the Lagrangian density of matter 
to form  the interacting scalar field  without  changing the total Lagrangian 
in Eq.  ( 3.40).  The form of the interaction term V ( ¢)  should be determined 
in such a way that the ground state with the lowest energy can be achieved 
by  adding  the  interacting  term  V(¢).  Now  we  consider  the  Lagrangian 
density with an interaction term 

£=Co- V(¢), 

(5.81) 

where  £ 0  =  ~(8JL¢8JL¢- m 2¢ 2
)  is  the  Lagrangian  density  for  free  scalar 
bosons.  V ( ¢)  is  the  self-interaction term,  such  as  A.¢4  term  in  the  Higgs 
mechanism.  In  the  following,  we  will  discuss  the  perturbation  method  to 
calculate the n-point functions  defined  by  Eq.  (5.51)

5.3.1  Perturbation  expansion 

We  can use Eq.  (5.84)  to make the perturbation calculations of the Green's 
functions  up to any orders in V. 

The generating functional  is  given by

Thus,  Z[J]  in  Eq.  (5.85)  becomes

(5.88) 

Since the V  dependent factor is now taken out of the functional integral, 
the functional  integral is  the one for  the free  field  and can be expressed in 
terms of the free  Feynman propagator.  We  have 

Z[ J]  = Noe -i J d4zV( t oJ~z)) e- ~ J d4xd4yJ(x)D..p(x-y)J(y)

iW0 [J]  is  the  zeroth order term,  which  is  given  by Eq.  (5.78).  The graphs 
in the parentheses are the first  order terms given  by Eq.  (5.98b).  The first 
one  corresponds  to  the  first  integral  in  Eq.  (5.99).  There  are  no  external 
lines  in  the  graph,  which  describes  the  vacuum  processes.  The  second 
graph corresponds to the second integral in Eq.  (5.99).  It has a  single loop 
attached and is  called the tadpole diagram,  which gives a  mass change due 
to  the  self-interaction.  The  third  graph  is  the  last  integral  in  Eq.  (5.99), 
which  describes the interaction process.

5.3.3.2  Terms  up  to  O(g 2 ) 

From Eq.  (5.94),  we can see that there are two different terms in the O(g2 ) 
contribution.  One is  iW2 [ J]  which  is  the genuine term of the second order 
in V  and the other is  - ~ ( iW1 [ J] )2 ,  which can be considered as the iteration 
of the  first  order  term.  We  draw the corresponding  Feynman  diagram  in 
Fig.  5.13. 

The first  graph in  Fig.  5.13  is  the Feynman diagram constructed by an 

iteration of the first order tadpole diagram.  It is the square of the two first(cid:173)
order terms.  As shown in Fig. 5.13, this graph consists two parts of the first 
order in V  connected by an internal line.  Such a graph can be split into two 
unconnected parts when one internal line is cut.  We call this kind of graphs 
one-particle  reducible.  Otherwise, it is called  one-particle-irreducible  (1PI). 
In  order  to  describe  the  1PI  graphs,  we  introduce  a  vertex  function 
r~~p(Pl, P2, · · ·  , Pn).  It is  also called  connected proper vertex function.  The

r~~p(Pl,P2, · · ·  ,Pn)  is  also  called the  amputated  Green's  function  because 
it is  the connected n-point  function  with external lines truncated, which is 
the  reason  we  add  subscript  'amp'.  To  simplify  the  notation,  we  usually 
omit the subscript  'amp'.

The 1PI part of the first  order term is  given by

Since  W0  depends  on  J  only  quadratically,  the  first  term  in  Eq.  (5.117)

divergence  problem can  be  solved  by  the  renormalization  procedure.  The

renormalization procedure gives  the effective  field.  The reason behind  the

though  we  can  add  any  forms  of the  mass  and  interaction  terms  into  the 
Lagrangian  of matter  without  changing  the  total  Lagrangian,  the  actual 
forms  of the mass and interaction terms are those achieving the lowest en(cid:173)
ergy for  the ground state.  The  physical  mass  and  other  quantities should 
be finite.  Actually we  have only a  particular form  of mass  and interaction 
terms to give  physical results. 

Now  we  discuss the divergence problem.  Let  us  consider the two-point

with wq  =  J q 2 + m 2 .  There are two poles located at ±wq =t=  i8.  According 
to  Cauchy's theorem,  the integral over  q0  can  be  evaluated  by closing  the 
integral route to enclose the poles and giving each pole a value of 27ri x  the 
residue  x  the sign of the direction of the integral route. 

The self-energy I:  becomes 

(5.125) 

The  integration  is  divergent.  By  introducing  an  upper  bound  A for  the 
integral over  lql,  the integral diverges  as  A2  when  A--too.  It is  called the 
quadratic divergence.

Principles  of Physics 

5.4.2  Power  counting 

We  can  use  power-counting  to  determine  the  degree  of divergence  of an 
integration.  When  an  integration  diverges  as  AD,  we  say  the  degree  of 
divergence is  D.  When D  > 0,  the integration diverges.  D  =  0 corresponds 
to a logarithmic divergence.  D  < 0 is the case of convergence.  For example, 
the integration of I; in Eq.  (5.123)  has  D  =  2 because d4 q  gives  4  power of 
q  and the denominator in the integrand gives two  powers of q. 

For an interaction/"'..)  cj;P  inn dimensional spacetime, when the Feynman 

diagram has  L  loop  and  I  internal lines,  we  have 

(5.126) 
because each loop contributes an integral J dnq  and each internal propaga(cid:173)
tor gives  a  power q- 2 . 

D  =  nL- 2I 

When a  diagram has V  interaction vertices,  there are p V  lines  in total 
because  each  vertex  contributes  p  lines.  We  denote  the  number  of  the 
external line as E.  One internal line originates and terminates at a vertex, 
consuming two legs of vertex.  There are I  internal lines.  Thus we  have 

pV=E+2I. 

(5.127) 
Each internal  line  carries an integral J dnq.  In the mean time,  each vertex 
contributes a delta-function associated with the conservation of momentum. 
Each delta-function, except the one associated with the overall momentum 
conservation,  decreases  the  actual  integration  number  by  one.  Thus  we 
have  also  the  following  relation  between  the  number  of loops  L  and  the 
number of vertices V 

Using Eqs.  (5.127)  and (5.128)  to eliminate Land I  in Eq.  (5.126), we have 

L=I-(V-1).

D  = n +

(n 

) 

(5.129) 

In  a  perturbation  expansion,  we  increase the  number  of vertices  V  to 
get  the  high  orders  of perturbation  expansion.  When  the  factor  of V  in 
Eq.  (5.129)  is  positive, the degree of divergence becomes larger with the in(cid:173)
creasing order of perturbation.  We denote the factor before V in Eq.  (5.129) 
by v 

n(p- 2) 

(5.130) 
When v  > 0,  we  have  an infinite  number of divergent  terms.  For  four(cid:173)
dimensional  spacetime  ( n  = 4),  if p  >  4 ( ¢5 , ¢6 , ·  ·  · ) ,  the  expansion terms 

-p

are  more and more  divergent.  p  =  4 is  the special  case with v  =  0.  When 
v  =  0,  the  degree  of divergence  D  =  4- E  is  independent  of V.  All  are 
divergent in the same manner,  which makes the divergent parts cancel out 
possible.  We  will  show that the renormalization procedure can remove the 
divergent  part.  Since  D  =  4 - E,  there  are  only  two  types  of divergent 
functions,  the  four-point  function  with  E  =  4  and the two-point  function 
withE= 2. 

When n  > 4,  there is  no  even integer p which gives v  ~ 0.  This poses a 
strong limitation on the dimension of spacetime in which the particles can 
have interactions that are renormalizable. 

5.5  Dimensional regularization 

In order to separate the divergent parts from the convergent parts, we need 
introduce a parameter that could measure and remove the divergence.  This 
is  called  regularization.  There are two  important types  of regularizations, 
one  is  the  Pauli- Villars  regularization  and  the other the  dimensional  reg(cid:173)
ularization.  The  Pauli-Villars  regularization  uses  the  parameter A -
the 
upper bound for  integral over  lql.  The dimensional regularization uses the 
parameter c =  4- n.  Both regularizations are equivalent.  In the following, 
we  will  use the dimensional  regularization. 

Now  we  consider the action S  in  n-dimensional spacetime. 

(5.131) 

Since Sis a  dimensionless quantity.  £  must have the dimension 1-n with l 
as  length dimension.  Thus we  have  [¢]  =  zl-n/ 2,  [g]  =  z-(n+v(l-n/ 2))  and 
[m]  =  z- 1 .  In the renormalization procedure, we  hope to keep the coupling 
constant g to be dimensionless.  We add a mass factor to the ¢4  and rewrite 
the interaction vertex term as  follows 

£  =  £  _  !!_  4-n~4

5.5.1  Two-point  function 

For  the  two  point  function,  the  divergent  integration  is  contained  in  the 
self-energy term.  We  consider  the  lowest  order  term of the self-energy  ~'

the corresponding  ~ in four-dimensional spacetime,  we  have

The f-functions with negative integers as variable have poles at 0.  Thus 
the expression of~ is divergent at n  =  4.  In order to separate the divergent 
terms, we  expand r  around the pole.  We  have 

where 1  ~ 0.577 is  the Euler-Mascheroni constant.  Inserting the expansion 
of r into Eq.  (5.134),  we  have

second line of Fig.  5.14.  The three contributions can be evaluated similarly. 
We  take the  middle  graph on  the  second  line  of Fig.  5.14  as  an  example. 
We  evaluate the connected vertex function  using  Eq.  (5.121)

The  arbitrary  mass  and  interaction  terms  in  Eq.  (5.81)  generally  do  not

interaction terms  to  obtain  a  physical  convergent  results.  This  process  is 
called the renormalization procedure.  In order to eliminate the divergence, 
we  add the counter terms

We  also make a transformation

Eq.  (5.153)  is  equivalent to an counter term  ~(Z -1)[(8¢) 2- m2¢2] for  the

to a  counter Lagrangian

We  can see that the divergent term is  contained in the ~(m 2 )  term.  In the 
one-loop expansion,  we  have  ~ 1  =  0  and thus  Z  =  1.  But in the two-loop 
approximation,  it  can  be  shown  that  ~1 #  0  because  the  graph  for  the 
two-loop approximation is  p-dependent.  Thus in general Z-=/=- 1. 

Using the renormalized Lagrangian, we  have the two-point function 

G(p, -p) 

(5.165) 

Since  ~2 (m 2 )  = 0,  G(p, -p)  has the pole  at the  physical  mass  m  with 
residue  i.  G(p, -p)  has  no  those  divergent  quantities  contained  in  ~(m 2 )

=  g {1- g [6f(s, t, u)- 6f(r)]} + O(g2

Since  the  divergent  term  rv  ~ does  not  depend  on the variables  s, t, u, 
the  substraction  6f(s, t, u)  - 6f(r)  removes  the  divergent  parts.  g does 
not  contain  the  divergent  term  rv  ~  and  is  thus  finite.  We  obtain  the

Due  to  the  renormalization,  the  emergent  values  or  the  measured  values 
of  physical  quantities  are  different  with  the  bare  values  in  the  original 
Lagrangian.  Although  the  relation  between  the  measured  values  and  the 
bare values  are complicated.  We  can use the effective potential to simplify 
the relation.

In the classical limit,  n ---t  0,  which corresponds to the tree approximation. 
Eqs.  (5.221)  and  (5.224)  show  that  the  effective  action  r[a]  becomes  the

the  Lagrangian  form  in  Eq.  (5.184)  is  equivalent  to  the  Euler-Lagrange 
equation.  Since  the effective  action  is  the same as  the classical action,  we 
can use the classical Lagrangian density in the Euler-Lagrangian equation. 

Since  the  divergence  comes  from  the  large  k,  the  renomalization  pro(cid:173)

cedure  can  remove  the  integration  over  large  k,  which  gives  an  effective 
field  and  effective  Lagrangian  with  effective  potential  in  low  energy.  The 
effective  Lagrangian in  low  energy is  applicable in  quantum mechanics. 

For  the  non-vacuum  case,  we  shall  use  the  Riemann  spacetime.  We 
can  first  carry out  the  renormalization  procedure  in  the  local  flat  metric 
approximately,  which  is  feasible  because  the  divergence  comes  from  the 
large  k  which  is  effective  locally.  The  renomalization  procedure gives  the 
effective field  for  the effective potential.  Then we  use the effective field  and 
effective  potential  in  the  action  in  the  Riemann spacetime.  Thus we  have 
the  effective  total  action  for  the effective  field  in  the  Riemann  spacetime, 
which  is  invariant  under  an  infinitesimal  spacetime  translation.  Similar 
to  the  procedure  leading  to  Eq.  (3.26),  we  obtain  the  classical  Einstein 
equations.

From  Quantum Field  Theory to 

Quantum Mechanics 

We  are now ready to deduce some approximate formalisms of physics which 
are  important for  the  applications.  One  is  the formalism  of quantum me(cid:173)
chanics which is  applicable in  microscopic scale and low  energy.  The other 
is  the formalism  of classical fields,  which is  applicable in macroscopic scale 
where the fluctuation  and correlation are small.  First we  consider the sys(cid:173)
tems  with  low  energy  where  the  quantum  mechanics  is  used.  When  we 
say something is  small or low,  we  should  have  a  reference  point.  Here the 
reference  energy is  the  mass  m  of particles.  When  the energy variation is 
much  smaller  than  the  mass  of particles,  the  energy  is  said  to  be  small. 
This  is  also  called  the  non-relativistic  limit.  In  this  case,  the  number  of 
particles  is  conserved  because  the  loss  of one  particle  costs  an  energy  of 
m,  which  is  much  larger than the  available  energy.  We  only  use  quantum 
mechanics  to describe  the massive  particles.  For  massless  field,  we  do  not 
have the mass of particle as a gauge energy and the conservation of particle 
number.  Massless field  is  related directly to the classics massless field,  such 
as electromagnetic field  in the case of photons.  In the following,  we will not 
use  the  natural units  so  that we  can write  out  the  Planck constant n and 
the speed  of light  c explicitly in the discussions of the non-relativistic and 
classical limits. 

6.1  Non-relativistic  limit of the Klein-Gordon equation 

First  we  consider  the  scalar  boson  field  described  by  the  Klein-Gordon 
equation.

Principles  of Physics 

In order to derive the non-relativistic limit  of the free  Klein-Gordon equa(cid:173)

¢(x, t)  = <f(x, t) exp ( -~mc"t). 

(6.2) 

We  have split the time dependence of ¢ into two terms:  the fast  oscillating 
term exp ( -*mc2t)  and the slow  changing term cp(x, t). 

In the non-relativistic limit, the difference of the energy E  of the particle 

and the mass  m  is  small.  We  define 

E' = E- mc2

In the non-relativistic limit,  E' <<  E  ~ mc2 .  Thus

Now we  consider the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation Eq.  (2.218) 

( in/yf18J.l  - mc){jJ  =  0. 

or 

(6.9) 

(6.10) 

The  coupling  of the  Dirac  fermion  field  with  the  photon  field  should 
maintain the gauge invariance.  We introduce the covariant derivative Df.l  = 
8/1  - i ;c Af.l  to replace the or~linary derivative 8/1  to include this interaction 
term.  In the classical limit, Af.l is replaced by its classical value and becomes 
the electromagnetic four-potential 

Af.l  =  {Ao(x), A(x)}. 

(6.11) 

Then the Dirac equation in the electromagnetic potentials is  given by 

ill:= [co· (-ihD) + eAo + /3mc2].,j,. 

(6.12) 

Since particle-antiparticle creation and annihilation are negligible in low 
energy,  we  can  consider  particles  and  antiparticles  separately.  Thus  the 
four-component  spinor {jJ  is  decomposed  into two-component spinors 

Then the Dirac equation Eq.  (6.12)  reads

where  ai are  Pauli's 2 x  2 matrices given by Eq.  (2.226)  and I  is  the 2 x  2

6.4  The operator of time translation in quantum mechanics 

When we  inspect  the  Schrodinger  equation,  we  can see  that the  left  hand 
side is  in8trp  and the right  hand side contains no  time derivative. 

Since ir = i~t, according to Eqs.  (2.64)  and  (2.65),  we  have 

{rpa(x, t), rp1(x', t)}  =  8a138(x- x'), 
{rpa(x,t),rp13(x',t)} = {rp~(x,t),rp1(x',t)} = 0. 

(6.40a) 

(6.40b) 

Thus rp(x, t)  and r.pt (x, t)  behave similarly as  annihilation and creation op(cid:173)
erators.  It should be noted that we have used the complex field  operator for 
the Dirac fermions  and thus we  have the complex r.p  and r.p t.  The operators 
rp(x, t)  and r.pt(x, t)  can be considered as complex annihilation and creation 
operators.  We  often  use  a and at  to  denote  r.p  and  r.pt,  respectively,  as  an 
indication of their properties.

6.5  Transformation of basis 

We  consider  a  system  of N-particles.  We  denote  HN  the  Hilbert  space of 
states for  a  system of N  identical particles. 

The creation and  annihilation operators can operate in  different  bases. 
Of particular important  are the state vectors  fx)  =  fx, t).  The meaning of 
fx)  =at (x, t) fO)  is  that there is  a  particle at position x. 

Creation and annihilation operators in  another basis can be  derived  as 
follows:  Inserting  the  completeness  relation,  we  obtain  a  transformation 
which transforms the orthonormal basis  {fa:)}  into another basis  {f&)} 

f&)  = L fa) (ala). 

By the definition of the creation operators al and al, we  have 

alf&1, &2, ... &n)  = f&, &1, &2, ... &n) 

= L (o:f&) fa:, &1' &2, · · · &n) 

(6.49) 

(6.50) 

Since Eq.  (6.50) is valid for  any state f&1, &2, · · · &n), we obtain the operator 
relation 

The annihilation operators satisfy the adjoint equation 

(6.51)

use  another definition for  wave functions

which contains the time evolution information of the state. 

Since any operator can be expressed as  a  linear combination of the set 
of all  product  of the  operators  (at, &a),  we  can  discuss  the  properties  of 
any operator in terms of creation and annihilation operators.

Therefore,  a  pair of bound fermions  can be considered  as  a  boson.  In this

Principles  of Physics 

Eqs.  (7.34a)  and  (7.34b)  are  the  d' ALembert  equations  for  A  and  cp,  re(cid:173)
spectively.  They are wave equations.  The solutions  of the inhomogeneous 
wave equations Eq.  (7.34)  can be obtained in the following  way. 

First we  consider the solution of the equation 
2 
\7  cp- c2  at2  =  Q(t)6  (r),

(7.35) 

which  is  the wave equation  Eq.  (7.34b)  for  a  source of a  point-like  charge

Eq.  (7.39)  is  a  one-dimensional  wave  equation,  which  has  the  solution  of 
the form 

u(r, t)  =  h  (t- ~) + h  (t + ~). 

(7.40) 
We  choose only h ( t - ~)  because the solution h ( t + ~)  does  not satisfy 
the causality principle.  Thus the solution of Eq.  (7.36)  has the form 

(  t)  = h  (t- ~)

(7.41) 

When  r  ---+  0,  the  potential  Q(t)63 (r)  approaches  to  infinity  and  thus  the 
spatial derivatives become much larger than the time derivative.  The second 
term in  Eq.  (7.35)  can be neglected when r---+  0.  Using the formula

For an static electric field,  the Maxwell equations have the form

v  X  E  = 0. 

The electric field  E  is  expressed by the relation 

E = -Vr..p.

D.r.p  =  0. 

We  define the Green's function  G(x- x')  of the Laplace equation by 

D.G(x- x')  =  <53 (x- x'). 

G(x- x')  has the form

by  Eq.  (7.55)  is  the  solution  of  Eq.  (7.54).  Thus  the  scalar  potential  <p

conservation of energy.  When  ~~ =  0,  we  have p =const.  In the classical 
limit,  it is  Newton's first  law.

For  a  central  potential,  the  potential  is  only  a  function  of the  radius  r.

[Lz, ix] = izix- ixiz = iliLy, 
[Lx, Ly]  = ixiy- LyLx  = iliLz. 

[Lx, Ly]  =  [Yfiz  - 2py, 2fix  - xfiz]

8.2  Elementary aspects of the Schrodinger equation 

We  consider a  system of N-particles with Hamiltonian operator given  by 

(8.35) 

204 

Principles  of Physics 

where "Vi (xi, t)  is  the external potential,  which is  the so-called one  particle 
potential.  "Oij (xi, Xj)  is  the  interaction  potential  between  two  particles  i 
and j, which  is  the two  particle potential,  such as  Coulomb potential. 

The Schrodinger equation reads 

·t<8<.p  H 
~nat=  <.p, 

(8.36) 

where <.p  is  the wave function. 

Let  us  derive  the  equation  of continuity  for  the  wave  function.  First 

we  consider  one  particle  case.  The  wave  function  is  a  function  in  three(cid:173)

dimensional space.  We  define  W = <.p*<.p  = I'PJ 2

.  Since 

'P:'Pa  = (xja, t)(a, tjx) = (xja~(t)aa(t)jx) = (xlna(t)jx), 

(8.37) 

the meaning of 

(8.38) 
can be interpreted as the probability of the particle occurring in the volume 
element dV at the position x and timet for  the state  Ja, t). 

W(x; t)dV = <.p*<.pdV 

For anN-particle system, the wave function is  a function  in 3N dimen(cid:173)

sional  space,  which  is  called  the  configuration  space  of the  system.  We 
denote an infinitesimal small volume element in the configuration space as 
dV 

(8.39) 

Then 

(8.40) 
is  the probability of the particle 1 occurring in the volume element  dV1  at 
x 1 ,·  ·  ·  and Nth particle occurring in dVN  at XN  at timet. 

Integrating  Eq.  (8.40)  with  respect  to  the  coordinates  of all  particles, 

excluding the particle k,  we  obtain 

W(xk)dVk = dVk J <.p*<.pdnk, 

(8.41) 

where  dnk  is  defined  by dV  =  dVkdnk.  W(xk)dVk  is  the probability of a 
particle occurring in dVk  at Xk. 

Using the Schrodinger equation, we  can obtain the equation of continu(cid:173)
ity for the probability W  in the configuration space.  Multiplying Eq.  (8.36) 
by  <.p*  and  then  subtracting  the  corresponding  complex-conjugated  equa(cid:173)

8.5  Path  integral formalism  for  quantum  mechanics 

8.5.1  Feymann's  path  integral for  one-particle  systems 
The  observable  operator  A is  a  function  of  momentum  operator  p  and 
position operator q.  Let us describe the dynamics of non-relativistic system 
in  path  integral  formalism,  as  we  did  in  the  quantum  field  theory.  First 
we  consider  the  simplest  case  of a  particle  moving  in  a  potential  in  one(cid:173)
dimensional space.  The  commutation relation of the momentum operator 
p and position operator {j  is  given by 

[fi, fJ]  =  in. 

(8.68) 

The  eigenstates  of these  operators  span  the  Hilbert  space.  Their  eigen(cid:173)
equations are 

filq)  =  qlq)' 
PIP)= PIP)· 

The state vectors are normalized by 

( q' I q)  =  8 ( q'  - q) , 
(p'lp)  = 8(p'- p) 

and obey the completeness relations J dq[q)(q[  = 1, 
J dplp) (PI  = 1.

According to Eq.  (6.101), p =  -inddq_·  We  apply p to the eigenstate IP)  and 
then project it onto  (ql.  We  obtain 

(qlfJIP)  =  p(qlp)  =  -in :q (qlp). 

Solving the differential equation,  we  have

(qlp)  = 27rn e~tPq.

Thus the coordinate representation of the momentum eigenstate is  a  plane 
wave. 

Using  the  relation  of the  wave  function  of  particle  <p a ( q, t)  with  the 

quantum state Ia, t) 

'Pa(q, t)  = (qla, t), 

(8.74) 

Quantum  Mechanics

we  can expand the quantum state  Ia, t)  of the system by 

I a, t)  =  j dq' cpa ( q', t) I q') .

The wave  function  of one  particle satisfies  the Schrodinger equation in 

the non-relativistic limit.

The formal solution of this equation is

'Po:(q, t)  =  e-*Ht'Po:(q, 0). 

(8.77) 
In Eq.  (8.74),  lq)  forms  a  basis in  the Hilbert space.  Since  lq)  does  not 
change with the time,  lq)  is  considered as a  rest  basis in the Hilbert space. 
We  can also  define  a  time dependent  basis  lq, t)b  by 

(8.78) 
lq, t)b  plays  the role of a  moving  basis in the Hilbert  space.  For simplicity 
of notation,  we  usually omit the subscript  'b'.  Since 

Ia, t)  =  j dqcpo:( q, t) lq) 

=  f dqe-*Ht'Po:(q,O)Iq), 

(8. 79) 

we  have 

'Po:(q, t)  = (qla, t) 

=  j dq' (qle- ftHt'Po:(q', 0) lq') 
= f dq' (q, tlcpa(q', O)lq') 

= (q, tla, 0) 
=  (q, tla)H, 

(8.80) 
where Ia) H  = Ia, 0)  is called the Heisenberg state vector.  Meanwhile Ia) s = 
Ia, t)  is  called  the Schrodinger state vector. 

Since  Eq.  (8. 78)  is  a  unitary  transformation,  the  orthonormality  and 
completeness relations remain valid for the time-dependent states.  We have 
lq, t) 

(q', tlq, t)  =  (q'le_*flte*iltlq)

q(t)  =  e{Htqe- *Ht. 

(8.83) 

lq, t)  =  e{Htiq)  is  the eigenstates of q(t)  because 

q(t)iq, t)  =  e*Htqe_*ftte{Htlq) 

=  e{Htqlq) 
= qlq, t). 

(8.84) 

Now  we  consider the transition amplitude 

(q', t'lq, t)  =  (q'ie--kH(t'-t)lq). 

(8.85) 
(q', t'lq, t)  is  also  called the Feynman kernel in  quantum mechanics,  which 
is  similar  to  the  Feynman  kernel  in  quantum  field  theory.  The  Feynman 
kernel contains all  the information one can get  by solving the Schrodinger 
equation  Eq.  (8.76).  We  can  obtain  the  time  development  of  the  wave 
function  at arbitrary t'  by the integration

Using  Eq.  (8.78),  each  of  the  kernel  elements  under  the  integral  can  be 
written as

This kernel  element  is  also  called  the transfer  matrix,  which  is  denoted  as

Since  the  Hamiltonian  depends  on  p and  q,  we  also  insert  a  complete 

set of the momentum eigenstates 

(qn+1JH(p, q) Jqn)  = J dpn (qn+11Pn) (Pn JH(p, q) Jqn). 

(8.92) 

The operators p and q can act to the left or to the right on their eigenstates,

One  can  also  use  a  more  symmetric  prescription,  the  so-called  Weyl's

8.5.2  Lagrangian function  in quantum mechanics 

The Hamiltonian of an one-dimensional non-relativistic system of one par(cid:173)
ticle has the following  standard form 

The  first  term  is  called  the  kinetic  energy  term  and  the  second  term  is 
called  the  potential  term.  Since  the  dependence  on  p  is  quadratic  form, 
the  integration over  p  can be  carried out explicitly.  We  use  the  Gaussian 
integral formula 

(8.102) 

(8.103)

The path integral expression for  the Feynman kernel Eq.  (8.100)  becomes 

(q', t'lq, t)  = j DqDp 2:, exp  ( i l dr [P<i- 2~p2 - V(q)]) 

= N  j Dqexp ( * l dr [; <i2

- V(q)l} 

where N  is  the normalization constant.  We  introduce

L(q, q)  =  ;  q2

- V(q). 

(8.104) 

(8.105) 

(8.106) 

S  is  called the  action functional  and L  is  the Lagrangian function  in quan(cid:173)
tum mechanics.  Eq.  (8.104)  becomes 

(q', t'lq, t)  =  N  j Dqexp (*s[q, <il). 

(8.107) 

8.5.3  Hamilton's  equations 
For a classical system, the action is much larger than the Planck constant n. 
We  can use stationary phase approximation.  The path integral is  approxi(cid:173)
mated with the extreme value  of the integrand.  The extreme condition of 
the action is  given  by 

!JS  =  0,

Principles  of Physics 

We  use  p  as  an  independent  variable  to  replace  q in  the  Lagrangian  and 
call  it the canonically conjugate momentum here.  Instead of the variables 
q  and q,  we  express the Lagrangian in terms of q  and p.  The Hamiltonian 
is  then obtained from  the Lagrangian as  a  Legendre transformation 

H(q,p)  =  pq(p)- L(q, q(p)). 

(8.112) 

the equation of motion  (Euler-Lagrange equation)  is  equivalent to the fol(cid:173)

(8.113b) 

Eq.  (8.113)  is  called  Hamilton's  equations  and  is  equivalent  to  Newton's 
equation. 

We  introduce  a  notation  for  the  following  derivatives  of two  functions 

A  and B.

which is  called the Poisson bracket.  With the help  of the Poisson bracket, 
the  time  evolution  of  a  physical  quantity  A  can  be  evaluated  with  the 
following  formula 

dA

In particular, when H  does  not depend on time explicitly,  we  have 

dH 
dt =at+ {H,H}PB =  0. 

8H 

(8.115) 

(8.116) 

Thus  H  is  a  constant  of motion  for  a  classical  system,  which  means  that 
the energy is  conserved. 

8.5.4  Path  integral formalism  for  multi-particle  systems 

We  can  easily  extend  the  path  integral  formalism  of one  particle  in  one(cid:173)
dimensional space to general systems of multi-particles in three dimensional 
space.  We  use  the  simplified  notation.  (q1, q 2, · · ·  , QN)  is  denoted  as  (q) 

Quantum  Mechanics 

215 

and (p 1 , P2, · · · , PN) as  (p).  The path integral for  the transition amplitude 
(Feynman kernel)  is  given by

The integration is  over all functions  p( t)  in the momentum space and over 
q(t)  in  the  position  space  with  the  boundary  conditions  q(t)  =  q  and 
q'(t)  = q'. 

We  use the general Hamiltonian form 

The  path  integral  Eq.  (8.117)  can  be  derived  from

8.6  Three  representations 

In  the  calculations  of  quantum  mechanics,  there  are  three  types  of  for(cid:173)
malisms.  We  call  them  Schrodinger,  Heisenberg  and  interaction represen(cid:173)
tations, which will  be discussed in the following. 

8.6.1  Schrodinger representation 

The elementary equation of quantum mechanics is the Schrodinger equation 

in :t 'Pa(t)  = H 'Pa(t), 

(8.126) 

Quantum  Mechanics 

217 

which  has the formal solution 

(8.127) 
The operators f>  =  !!: V x  and x do  not contain the time t  as  an explicit 

'Pa(t)  =  e-*Ht'Pa(O). 

t 

variable.  The average value of an operator O(f>, x)  is  given  by 

A 

6 =  (a16(:f>, x) Ia) 
=  j <p~O Ov,x) 'l'nd3 x. 

(8.128) 

This is the formalism of the so-called Schrodinger representation.  In the 
Schrodinger  representation,  we  have  time  dependent  wave  function  'Pa(t) 
and time independent operators. 

8.6.2  Heisenberg  representation 

Since  the experimental measured  properties of quantum system are  mani(cid:173)
fested  in  the  average values  of the operators given  by  Eq.  (8.128),  we  can 
transform the average value  formula  Eq.  (8.128)  into the following  form 

6  =  s(a, tl6sla, t)s 

We have used the subscript S to denote the Schrodinger representation. 

(8.129) 

We  now define  a  new  representation of operators and state vectors 

la)H = Ia, O)s 

and 

(8.130) 

(8.131) 

This  representation  denoted  by  the  subscript  H  is  called  the  Heisenberg 
representation.  In the Heisenberg representation, we have the same formula 
to calculate the average value of operators 

6 = s(al6sla)s 

= s(a, Ole*Ht6s(O)e-jJftla, 0) s 
=  H(ai6Hia)H· 

(8.132) 

Therefore,  the  Schrodinger  representation  formalism,  in  which  the  wave 
function  <p(t)  is  time  dependent  and  operators  are  time  independent,  can 
be transformed into an equivalent formalism,  in which the wave function  is 
time independent  and operators are time dependent. 

218 

Principles  of Physics 

In  the  Heisenberg  representation,  operators  are  time  dependent.  The 
equation of motion which has the solution of Eq.  (8.131) can be easily found 
to have the form 

a A 
in 8
tO(t)  =  [O(t),H]. 

A 

A 

(8.133) 

This  equation has the same form  as  the Heisenberg's equations of motion 
in quantum field theory (for example Eq.  (2.163)).  In quantum field theory, 
the operators are the field  operators.  Heisenberg's equations of motion are 
the physical time evolution equation for  quantum field.  Here Eq.  (8.133)  is 
an artificial equation defined to facilitate the calculations. 

8.6.3 

Interaction  representation 

Many-body  Schrodinger  equations  are  often  difficult  to  be  solved.  The 
usual  approach is  the perturbation expansion  method,  which  can be dealt 
more  easily  in  the  interaction  representation.  We  divide  the  Hamiltonian 
operator into two parts 

(8.134) 

where  flo  is  a  Hamiltonian  that  can  be  solved  exactly.  Generally  flo  is 
taken to the Hamiltonian without interactions.  In some cases,  flo  is chosen 
to be a solvable Hamiltonian including some specific interactions.  The term 
V is  the  remaining  parts of  fl.  The principle  of choosing  flo  and V is  to 
make the effect  of V small while  maintaining  flo  solvable. 

In the interaction representation,  both operators  and state vectors  are 

time dependent.  They are defined  by the following  formulas: 

(8.135) 

and 

Ia, t)I = e*flote-*fltla, O)I 
= e-kHote-*fltla)H 
=  e*flotla, t)s, 

(8.136) 
where we have used subscript I  to denote the interaction representation.  In 
the interaction representation, the average value of the operator 6 is  given 
by 

6 = s(al6sla)s 

=  s(ale_*flot6Ie*flotla)s 
=  I(ai6IIa)I. 

(8.137) 

Quantum  Mechanics 

219 

We have the same formula in the interaction representation to calculate 
the  average values  of operators  as  in  the other  representations.  The time 
dependence  of the  operators is  governed  by the  unperturbed  Hamiltonian

The time dependence of the state vectors is governed by the interaction V.

We  introduce an operator U(t)  defined  by 

which has the meaning of the operator of time translation for  states in the 
interaction representation.  From Eq.  (8.136),  we  have 

lo:, t)I  =  U(t) lo:, O)I 

(8.141) 

(8.140) 

with U(O)  =  1.  The time derivative of U(t)  reads

(8.142) 

We  can solve this equation in the following  way.  Integrating both sides 

of the equation, we obtain 

Since U(O)  = 1,  we  have 

O(t)- OW)  =  -~ [  dt, V,(t)O(t). 
0(t) = 1- ~ l dt, VI(t)O(t). 

(8.143)

(8.145) 
Using  the  time-ordering  operator  T,  we  can  reform  Eq.  (8.145)  into  the

The  interaction  representation  formalism  can  be  used  to  do  perturbation 
calculations. 

8.7  S  Matrix 

In terms of the operator U(t),  we  introduce another important operator S 
(often called  S  matrix) 

s(t, t') = U(t)ut(t'). 

(8.147) 
We  can  also  express  the time evolution of the states in  the interaction 

representation in  terms of S  matrix. 

[a, t)I = U(t)[a, O)I 

=  S(t, t')U(t')[a, O)I 
= S(t, t')[a, t')I. 

(8.148) 
Thus the S  matrix changes the wave function 'P 1 ( t)  at time t into the wave 
function  'PI(t')  at  time  t'.  One  can  easily  check  that  S  operator  has  the 
following  properties: 

S(t, t)  =  1, 
st(t, t') = u(t')ut(t) = s(t', t), 
s(t, t')S(t', t")  =  S(t, t").

8.8  de  Broglie waves 

Although we  start from  the constituent  principle of identical  particles,  all 
the  equations  of  motion  are  wave  equations,  we  have  the  particle-wave 
duality naturally.  When there is no interaction between particles, a particle 
state with momentum p  is  a  plane wave state with wave function given  by 

'P(x, t)  =  Aexp [i(k · x- wkt)]. 

(8.150) 

where  A  is  an  amplitude  factor.  k  and  Wk  are  the  wave  number  and  fre(cid:173)
quency  respectively  (as  an  example,  see  Eq.  (2.353)  for  Dirac  fermions). 
The momentum p  is  given by 

h  k 

P = nk =  ~lkl· 

The energy of the state is  given  by 

E  =  hwk. 

(8.151) 

(8.152) 

Eqs.  (8.151)  and  (8.152)  are called the  De  Broglie  relations. 

For massless  photons, 

E  =  hwk  =  nke. 

(8.153) 

For massive particles, 

E  = hwk  =  Vm2e4  + n2k 2e2 =  )m2e4  + p2e2. 

(8.154) 

In the nonrelativistic limit,  expanding Eq.  (8.154)  gives

Principles  of Physics 

The  phase  velocity  is  larger  than  the  speed  of light  in  vacuum,  while 
the group velocity is  smaller than the speed  of light.  A  plane wave  is  not 
a  local  state.  The  state  extends  the  whole  space.  Therefore,  the  phase 
velocity  can  not  be  assigned  as  a  velocity  of the  particle.  When  we  talk 
about motion of a particle, we  actually talk about the energy transport and 
thus the particle should be in a localized state.  We can show that the group 
velocity corresponds to the velocity of the energy transport.  A free  particle 
in a  localized state is  described  by a  finite  wave packet.  For simplicity,  we 
assign  the  direction  of the  wave  vector  as  x  direction.  A  group  of waves 
propagating in the x  direction can be described  by the following  localized 
wave packet state. 

<p(x, t)  = 

1ko+l::,.k 

ko-l::,.k 

c(k) exp [i(kx- w(k)t)]dk, 

(8.159) 

where  ko  =  ~:  is  the  mean  wave  number  of the  group  and  Lk measures 
the extension of the wave packet.  We  consider a localized wave packet with 
Lk <<  k0 .  We  can expand the frequency win a  Taylor series  around k0 . 

w(k)  =  w(ko) + ( ~) k=ko (k- ko) 

+ ! ( d2 ~ ) 
2  dk 

k=ko 

( k - ko) 2  + . . . . 

(8.160) 

Inserting the expansion Eq.  (8.160)  into Eq.  (8.159)  and taking k' = k- ko 
as the new  integration variable, we  obtain 

<p(x, t)  = exp [i(kox- w(ko)t)] 

x 

j l::,.k 

-l::,.k 

exp [i(x- v9 t)k']C(k0  + k')dk'. 

(8.161) 

Since  k' <<  k0 ,  we  have C(ko + k')  ~ C(k0 ).  Then Eq.  (8.161)  becomes 

<p(x, t)  =  exp [i(kox- w(ko)t)]C(k0) jt::,.k  exp [i(x- v9t)k']dk' 

-l::,.k 

=  2C(ko) sin[Lk(x- vgt)]  exp [i(kox- w(ko)t)]

C(x, t)  = 2C(k) sin[Lk(x- v9t)]_ 

X- Vgt 

(8.162) 

(8.163) 

Quantum  Mechanics 

223 

C(x, t)  is  the amplitude of the wave packet.  C(x, t)  has its maximum at 

which  means that the maximum of the amplitude moves with a  velocity 

v9t- X= 0, 

(8.164) 

dx 

V  =  dt  =  Vg. 

(8.165) 

The  velocity  of the  wave  packet  is  the  one  that  amplitude  maximum 
of the wave  packet  propagates with.  Thus the velocity of a  particle is  the 
group velocity,  with can only be smaller than the speed of light in vacuum. 
For  massless  photons,  its group velocity is  given by 

dw 

d(ck) 

Vc  =  dk  =  ----;n;;- =  c, 

(8.166) 

which is  the reason we  call cas the speed of light  in vacuum.  Any massless 
particles have the velocity of c.  Since in vacuum, only photons are massless, 
photons have the maximum velocity in  nature. 

8.9  Statistical  interpretation of wave  functions 

As  for  the  meaning  of the  wave  function  cp(x, t),  according  to  Eq.  (8.37), 
cp*(x, t)<p(x, t)  =  (xlnalx)  is  the  probability  that  there  is  the  particle  at 
x.  This  is  the  statistical  interpretation  given  by  Max  Born.  However, 
one  may  ask  why  there  is  only  a  probability  of  finding  a  particle  at  a 
position  x  instead  of  finding  it  definitely.  A  particle  should  be  in  one 
position  at  a  time.  If a  particle  is  in  one  place,  how  does  it  manage  to 
move to another place in distance simultaneously.  This will give a nonlocal 
existence  for  a  particle.  The  interpretation  is  that  a  particle  can  be  in  a 
state which is  nonlocal.  This state could  be characterized by some guiding 
fields  as  termed  by Born.  The  guiding  field  could  be energy,  momentum, 
or spin.  These quantities are generally conserved due to the symmetry and 
the corresponding states are stable.  However,  the particles themselves  are 
local.  We  can only find  a  particle when the particle is  at x.  The particles 
are always  created  and  annihilated everywhere with  a  probability.  Due  to 
the  conservation  of energy,  the  number  of  particles  is  conserved.  For  a 
single-particle  state,  although  particles  create  and  annihilate  everywhere 
for  all time.  there is  only one particle in total at any moment, which occurs 
in  someplace.  If we  make  a  measurement,  we  could  pick  up  the  particle 
only when it is  created.  The probability of creating a  particle at x  is  I'PI 2 . 
Thus we  have only a  probability of 1'1'1 2  to pick up the particle at x.  After 

224 

Principles  of Physics 

we  pick up  the particle,  the particle can not  be  annihilated  back as  usual. 
This is  the irreversibility of the measurement, which leads to the quantum 
collapse to the state that the measurement selects.  A path of a particle in a 
classical limit is only the path of the localized state guided by the equations 
of motion and conservation laws. 

8.10  Heisenberg uncertainty  principle 

In  the  microscopic  scale,  we  are  not  able  to  measure  the  exact  position 
and momentum of a particle simultaneously, which is  called the Heisenberg 
uncertainty  principle.  We  will  show  in  the  following  that  the  Heisenberg 
uncertainty  principle  is  just  a  property  of  the  position  and  momentum 
operators. 

First let  us  make a  qualitative analysis,  we  consider  a one-dimensional 
wave  packet.  From  Eq.  (8.163),  we  can  see  that  the  distance  D.x  of the 
first  minimum at x  =  Xm  of the wave packet amplitude from the maximum 
at  x  =  0  is  determined  by the  factor  sin ( D.k · Xm)  =  sin ( D.k · D.x).  This 
distance  can  be  characterized  as  the  extension  of  the  wave  packet.  We 
obtain 

D.kD.x  =  1r. 

(8.167) 

Using de Broglie relations, the momentum extension is  determined by nD.k. 
We  have 

(8.168) 

This relation shows that the position and momentum of a particle state can 
not  be determined exactly at the same time. 

Now  we  derive  the  uncertainty  principle.  The  average  values  of the 

momentum and position operators are given by 

Px  = J <p*(x) (-iii :x) <p(x)dx, 
x = J <p*(x)x<p(x)dx.

Eq.  (8.179)  is called the Heisenberg  uncertainty relation for  momentum and 
position.  The  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  is  not  limited  to  the  posi(cid:173)
tion and momentum operators.  We  can derive the Heisenberg uncertainty 
relations for  arbitrary observables. 

Let  us  consider two hermitian operators A and B.  The commutator of 

the two operators has the form 

[A,fJ]  = i6. 

(8.180) 
6 is  called  the  remainder  of commutation  (or  commutation  rest).  When 
A and B commute, 6 is  zero.  It is  easy to see  that 6 is  also  a  hermitian 
operator.  The deviation  of the operators from  the mean values  is  defined 
by 

~A= A-A, 
~B=B-B. 

(8.181a)

It is  easy to prove that  ~A and  ~B obey the same commutation rela(cid:173)

I(n) = J l(n~A- i~B)'Pi 2

(8.182) 

(8.183) 

We  can evaluate I(n) in  the following  way

=  J 'P*(n~A + i~B)(n~A- i~B)'fJdx

=  n 2 (~A) 2 + a6 + (~B) 2 
~ 0. 

(8.184) 

Since I(n) ~ 0 for  any real number, the minimum I(nm) of I(n) should 

also  be larger than or equal to zero. 

I(nm) = (~B)2 - C A

Eq.  (8.186)  is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in its most general form. 
In  particular,  the  energy  operator E in  quantum  mechanics  is  defined  as 
E = in ff£.  For the quantum system governed by the Schrodinger equation, 
the  energy  operator  is  equal  to  Hamiltonian  operator.  The  commutation 
relation between energy and time operators is  given  by

Principles  of Physics 

This relation means a particle state with short life time will experience large 
energy change.  This  phenomenon is  related to the conservation of energy. 
If one  wants to transform  a  state with  a  definite  energy  (an eigenstate of 
Hamiltonian)  to  a  state with  a  different  energy,  one  needs  apply external 
disturbance.  Otherwise,  it  would not change.  The change can be achieved 
either in a short time by applying a large external disturbance or in a long 
time by a small disturbance.  A state which does not change with the time in 
average is called the stationary state.  We will show that it is the eigenstate 
of Hamiltonian.

<p(x, t)  = <p(x)f(t). 

We  have 

in<p(x) :tf(t) =  H<p(x)f(t).

After  separating the variables,  we  have

229 

This  equation  is  also  called  the  Schrodinger  equation  and  is  used  mostly 
because H  does not depends on time explicitly in most applications.  Math(cid:173)
ematically,  Eq.  (8.195)  is  an eigenvalue equation of Hamiltonian.  E  is  the 
energy eigenvalue, which is  real because the Hamiltonian is  a hermitian op(cid:173)
erator.  Generally the eigenvalue equation Eq.  (8.195)  has a set of solutions 
'Pn(x)  characterized  by  n.  n  is  called  the  quantum  number.  The  energy 
eigenvalues  En  is  also  numbered  using  n.  The  solution  <t?n(x, t)  then  has 
the form

which is  an oscillatory function  in time,  with the phase factor  exp ( -i ~t). 
We  generally normalize the solutions with 

J <t?n(x, t)*<pn(x, t)dV = J <t?n(x)*<pn(x)dV = 1. 

(8.197) 

This  normalization condition  means  that  a  state contains one particle.  It 
can be shown that <t?n(x)  are orthonormal, i.e.  (<t?n l<t?m)  =  8nm·  The general

When energy is  small,  we  can neglected  the higher order term.  V(x 0 )  is  a

(9.13) 

We  will  show  that  they  have  the  same  properties  as  the  annihilation  and 
creation  operators  we  introduced  previously  in  the  quantum  field  theory. 
Historically, physicists first introduced the hermitian operators p and i:,  and 
found that p and i; satisfied the canonical commutation relation [i:, f>]  = in. 
Then using Eq.  ( 9. 9)  to introduce the annihilation and creation operators a 
and at.  The second procedure is thus called the second quantization.  In this 
book,  we  use  the  annihilation  and  creation operators to derive the canon(cid:173)
ical  commutation relations  in  the quantum field  theory.  The procedure is 
reversed in the quantum field  theory. 

Using the commutation relation of p and i:,  we  have 

[a, at]= 

1 
n(-i[x,f>J  +i[P,x]) = 1. 
2

(9.10) 
Eq.  (9.10)  shows  that  a and  at  have  the  same  commutation  relation  as 
the  annihilation  and  creation operators.  Similarly,  we  can  also  define  the 
number operator 

iV =at a. 

Using the definition of a and at  in Eq.  (9.9),  we  have

9.1.3  Eigenvalues  and eigenstates 
Since  the  Hamiltonian  operator  ii commutes  with  N,  ii and  N can  be 
diagonalized simultaneously.  We  introduce  In)  to  denote the eigenstate of 
N with the eigenvalue n. 

Using Eq.  (9.13),  we  have 

Thus the energy eigenvalues are given by 

Nln)  =  nln). 

Hin)  =  llw  ( n + D In). 
En = llw  ( n + D . 

(9.14) 

(9.15) 

(9.16) 

Now  we  show that n  is  a  nonnegative integer.  First we  note that 

flat In)  =  ([N, at]+ at N)ln) 
=  (at [a, at] +at N) In) 
=  (n +  l)atln). 

(9.17) 

and 

Naln)  =  ([N, a]+ aN) In) 

= (at[a,a] +  [at,a]a+&N)In) 
=  (n- l)aln). 

(9.18) 
Thus  at In)  and  aln)  are  also  the  eigenstates  of N with  eigenvalue  n  +  1 
(increased  by  one)  and  n - 1 (decreased  by  one),  respectively.  This  is  the 
reason we  call at  and a the creation  (or  raising)  operator and annihilation 
(or lowering)  operator. 

Since aln)  is  the eigenstate of N with eigenvalue  n- 1,  we  have 

&In)  =  cln- 1), 

where cis the normalized constant, which can be determined  by 

(nlataln) =  lcl 2 (n -lin -1) = lcl 2

. 

Thus 

n = lcl 2  2:  0. 

(9.19) 

(9.20) 

(9.21) 

Eq.  (9.21)  shows  that  n  is  a  nonnegative  number.  Thus  we  can  write 
Eq.  (9.19)  in the following  form 

aln)  =  ei8 vnln- 1), 

(9.22) 

234 

Principles  of Physics 

where 6 is  a  phase parameter.  Similarly,  we  have 
atln)  =  e-i8vn +lin+ 1). 

(9.23) 
Applying  the  annihilation  operator  a to  Eq.  (9.22)  consecutively,  we 

have 

akin)= eik8 y'n(n- 1) ... (n- k + l)ln- k). 

(9.24) 
If n  is  not  an  integer,  we  will  have  an eigenstate  In')  =  In-k) with  n'  a 
negative  number  for  k  >  n,  which  contradicts with Eq.  (9.21)  demanding 
that n' has to be a  nonnegative number.  Thus n can only be a nonnegative 
integer.  When n  is  an integer, the sequence  In)  terminates at n  =  0. 

Since the smallest value of n is zero, the ground state IO)  of the harmonic 

oscillator has the energy 

Eo= -liw 
'

which is called the zero-point energy.  Other eigenstates can be obtained by 
applying the creation operator at  successively 

(9.25) 

(9.26) 

(9.27)

Thus ii has the eigenstate  In)  (n  =  0, 1, 2, · · ·) with the eigenvalue 

In)  =  (at)n IO).

9.2.3  Angular momentum  operators 

Now  we  derive  the eigenstates  and  eigenvalues  of the  angular  momentum 
operator.  For  the  applications  to  more generalized  cases,  we  consider  the 
total angular momentum operator 

A2 
J

A2

J  = Jx  + Jy  + Jz · 

A2 

It commutes with each component Ji  of j

Thus J  and  Jz  can  be diagonalized simultaneously.  We  denote the eigen-
values of J  and  Jz  by a  and b,  respectively.  We  have 

A2 

A 

A2 
J  Ia, b)  =ala, b), 
Jz Ia, b)  = bla, b). 

We  introduce two  non-hermitian operators 

j± = Jx  ± iJy.

Principles  of Physics 

J± are called the ladder operators.  They satisfy the following  commutation 
relations 

[J+, ]_] =  2nJz, 
[Jz, J±] = ±nJ±, 
A  2 
[J  ,J±] = 0. 

A 

(9.55a) 

(9.55b) 

(9.55c) 

Using  above commutation relations,  we  have 

Jz(J±Ia,b)) = ([Jz,J±] + J±Jz)la,b) 

=  (b± n)(J±Ia,b)). 

(9.56) 

Eq.  (9.56)  shows that J± Ia, b)  are the eigenstates of Jz  with the eigenvalues 
b ±  n.  When we  apply  J+(J-) to  an eigenstate  Ia, b)  of Jz,  we  obtain an 
eigenstate of jz  with its eigenvalue increased  (decreased)  by one unit of n. 
This is  the reason why  J±  are called the ladder operators. 

A2 

A 

Applying J  to J±la, b),  we  have

A2  A 
J  ( J± Ia, b))  = J±J  Ia, b)  = aJ± Ia, b). 

A

Eq.  (9.57)  shows that J± Ia, b)  are also the eigenstates of J  with the eigen-
value a.  Thus

where C±  are the normalization constant. 

9.2.4  Eigenvalues  of J2  and Jz 
First we  prove  that  the eigenvalue  b of  Jz  has  an  upper  limit  for  a  given 
eigenvalue a of J  .  We  use  the following  formula

Thus

which means that

Eq.  (9.61)  is  equivalent  to

-a2 ::;b::;a2. 

1 

(9.62) 

Therefore,  b has  an  upper  limit  for  a  given  a.  When  we  apply  J+  succes-
sively to  Ja, b),  we  could obtain the eigenstate of J  and  Jz  with increased 
eigenvalue of Jz  until the upper limit of the eigenvalue of Jz  is reached.  We 
denote the maximum eigenvalue of Jz  as bmax·  Then 

A2 

A 

Otherwise  J+ Ja, bmax)  would  be  the  eigenstate  of  Jz  with  the  eigenvalue 
bmax + fi,  which contradicts with the statement that bmax  is  the maximum 
eigenvalue.  Applying Eq.  (9.63)  with  }_ gives 

j_}+Ja, bmax)  =  0. 

(9.64) 

(9.63) 

J _ J + can be rewritten as

Since  Ja, bmax)  is  not  a  null state, we  have

Solving a gives 

a- b~ax- fibmax  =  0. 

a= bmax(bmax + n). 

(9.65) 

(9.66) 

(9.67) 

(9.68) 

Eq.  (9.62)  also shows that there is  a  lower limit of the eigenvalue b.  We 

denote the minimum value of bas bmin·  Then 

}_Ja, bmin)  =  0. 

(9.69) 

Similarly,  we  have 

A  A 
J+J-Ja,bmin)  =  (J  - Jz  +fiJz)Ja,bmin) 

A 2 

A2

Then we  obtain

a= bmin(bmin  - n).

Applying J+  successively to  [a, bmin),  we will be able to reach  [a, bmax)·

Suppose that we  obtain  [a, bmax)  after  n  time operating J+,  we  have 

bmax  =  bmin + nn =  -bmax + nn, 

which gives 

nn 
bmax  =  2· 

We  introduce a quantum number  j  defined  by 

. 
n 
J =(cid:173)

(9.74) 

(9.75) 

(9.76) 

Since n is  nonnegative integer,  j  is  either an nonnegative integer or a half(cid:173)
integer.  Using  Eq.  (9.68),  we  have 

We  also  introduce m = bjn as  another quantum number.  Thus 

b=mn. 

m  takes the following  2j + 1 value for  a  given j. 
m  = 0,±1,±2,··· ,±j. 

(9.77) 

(9.78) 

(9.79) 

We  usually use  [j, m)  to  denote  the eigenstates of J  and  Jz  instead of

J  [j, m)  =  j(j + 1)n  [j, m)

Since  the  eigenvalues  of L

is  l(l + 1),  Eq.  (9.49)  is  the  usual  form  of 
the eigenvalue  equation for  L  , which  is  the  reason we  use  l(l + 1)  as  the 
separation constant in  Eq.  (9.47).

9.2.5  Matrix  elements  of angular momentum  operators 

Now  let  us  evaluate the matrix elements of the angular momentum opera(cid:173)
tors.  From Eqs.  (9.80)  and  (9.81),  we  have 

(j', m'IJ2 1J, m)  =  j (j + 1 )n2 bj' jbm'm 

(9.82) 

and 

(9.83) 
The  matrix  elements  of  J±  can  be  determined  using  the  following 

equation 

(9.84) 

Eq.  (9.84)  is  just  Eq.  (9.58)  rewritten  in  terms  of  j  and  m.  Using  the 
relation

= (j ~ m) (j ± m + 1 )n2

. 

(9.86) 

Thus the matrix elements of J±  are given by 

(j', m'iJ±iJ, m)  =  )(j ~ m)(j ± m + l)nbj'jbm'm±j· 

(9.87) 

9.2.6  Spherical  harmonics 

In Eq.  ( 9.48), Y ( B, 'P)  is  the wave function of the angular part in the spher(cid:173)
ical coordinate representation.  We have shown that there are two quantum 
number l  and m.  For the spherical coordinate representation, we  introduce 
the direction eigenstate In).  Then 

(niJ, m)  =  Yzm(n.)  =  Yzm(e, 'P)· 

Since  lj, m)  is  the eigenstate of Jz,  we  have 

-in :'P Y,m(e, 'P)  =  mnY,m(e, 'P ). 

Thus 

(9.88) 

(9.89) 

(9.90)

Principles  of Physics 

In order to fulfill the requirement that the wave function is single valued, 

we  impose 

which  demands m  to be an integer.  According to Eq.  ( 9. 79), 

(9.92) 
Thus l should be integer.  To obtain the 8-dependence of Yzm(e, <p),  we  start 
with the case of m = l.  According to Eq.  (9.63),  we  have 

m  = 0,±1,±2,· ·· ,±l.

-ill£'"' (i :e- cote :'1' )-v,=(e, 'P)

The solution of Eq.  (9.94)  is  given by 

¢i(8) = Cz  sinl 8, 

(9.93) 

(9.94) 

(9.95) 

where cz  is  the normalization constant.  The normalization condition is 

(9.96) 

From the  normalization  condition,  we  can only  determine  the  modula 
of cz.  There is  an undetermined phase factor ei8•  Generally we take <5  to be 
zero.  The undetermined  phase factor  comes  from  the complex wave  func(cid:173)
tion of the Dirac fermions.  We  have shown in the chapter of quantum field 
theory that the Dirac fermions  are composite in  order to fulfill  the causal(cid:173)
ity  and  covariance  principles.  The doublet  field  operators are needed  and 
thus the  Dirac  fermion  field  operators are complex.  Although the doublet 
field  operators  are not  independent,  there is  an  constant  phase factor  un(cid:173)
determined because the composite can not be broken into two independent 
particles  due  to  the  causality  and  covariance principles.  The phase factor 
can be important in  some  periodic  systems  and  adiabatic evolution where 
the phase factor  is  called  Berry phase or geometric phase.

charge  particle  has  a  much  larger  mass  than the  electron  and  is  localized

two  particles, the proton and electron,  it is  a two-body problem.  However, 
it  can be  reduced  to  one-body  problem.  The  Schrodinger  equation of the

10.1  Equi-probability principle and statistical distributions 

For  an isolated system which  does  not exchange energy and  particles with 
external environment, the energy of the system is fixed.  The different states 
are the degenerate states of energy.  We  call these states microscopic states 
in statistic mechanics.  One can not tell the differences between these states. 
We  have  the  basic  principle  that  all  the states  are  equally  probable to  be 
occupied in an isolated system.  This is called the Boltzmann equi-probability 
principle,  which  the  standard  assumption  in  statistical  physics.  A  set  of 
identical isolated systems is  called the micro-canonical ensemble.  Thus the 
statistical  distribution  for  a  system  in  micro-canonical ensemble,  which  is 
called the  micro-canonical  distribution,  is  a  constant. 

Now  we  consider  a  system  (denoted  as  system  1)  in  contact  with  a 

larger system  (denoted  as  system  2).  The larger system is  called  the ther(cid:173)
mal  reservoir.  The two  systems  contain large  number  of particles  N  ( typ(cid:173)
ically  N  rv  1023 ).  We  call  the  systems  with  large  number  of particles  the 
macroscopic systems.  When the two systems are isolated, the states in each 
system are equally  probable to  being occupied.  After  the two  systems  are 
in  contact, the two  systems will  be in  thermal equilibrium with each other 
when the thermal quantities of the two systems  are not  changed.  The sys(cid:173)
tem and the thermal reservoir can be considered to form an isolated system. 
This is valid because we can always include the surroundings in contact into 
the thermal reservoir  until  the total system is  isolated.  For a  macroscopic 
system,  the  boundary  part  can  be  neglected.  Thus  the  two  systems  are 
sufficiently weakly interacting that we  can write 

(10.1) 
where E  is  the energy of the system  1 and  E' the energy of the system  2. 

Et  =  E + E', 

251 

252 

Principles  of Physics 

Et is the total energy of the two systems.  According to the equi-probability 
principle,  the probability p(En)  (also  denoted  as  Pn)  that the system  1 in 
a state n  with the energy En  is  directly proportional to the number of the 
possible states of the total system for  this situation. 

p(En)  ex:  1 · O'(E'), 

(10.2) 

where O'(E)  is  the number of the states of the system 2 with energy E'.  In 
the derivation ofEq. (10.2), we have used the condition that the two systems 
are  not  correlated  statistically  because  the  two  systems  are  macroscopic 
ones  with  large  number  of  particles  and  the  contact  boundary  between 
them is  only a  minor  part of the total system.  Eq.  ( 10.2)  does  not hold in 
the microscopic scale.  Thus the two systems fulfilling  Eq.  (10.2)  should be 
macroscopic systems.  We  introduce a  macroscopic quantity 

S = k lnO(E), 

(10.3) 

where  O(E)  is  the  number  of the  states  of the  system  with  energy  E.  S 
is  called  the  entropy  of the  system.  k  is  a  constant  defining  the  unit  of 
entropy.  Eq.  (10.3)  is  usually called the Boltzmann entropy relation.  Using 
Eq.  (10.1),  we  have 

with 

(10.4) 

(10.5) 

When the thermal reservoir  is  large,  we  have  En  <<  E'  ~ Et.  We  can 

expand  S'  in  a  Taylor series: 

S'(Et-E  )=S'(Et)-E  -+-E2 -+···.

We  define the  temperature  of a  macroscopic system as

T= as· 

(10.6) 

(10. 7) 

For any macroscopic system, we  have the lowest energy state as the ground 
state.  However, there is  no limit to the highest energy generally because we 
have selected the positive sign in the kinetic term for  the Hamiltonian.  An 
opposite selection would  result  in  an opposite sign of temperature but the 
physics is  not changed.  When we  increase the energy, the increased energy 
allows  the  particles  to occupy the  states with  higher  energy.  The number 
of  possible  microscopic  states  will  increase.  0  represents  the  number  of 

Statistical  Mechanics 

253 

the microscopic states.  Thus the increase of energy leads to the increase of 
entropy.  Thus, according to Eq.  (10.7), the temperature should be positive. 

T>O. 

(10.8) 

There  are  some  artificial  systems  which  have  only  finite  energy  levels.  In 
these systems,  negative temperature can be achieved. 

In terms of temperature, Eq.  (10.5)  becomes 

(10.9) 

Tis the temperature of the thermal reservoir.  We  usually use  j3  to denote

j3 = kT.

For a large thermal reservoir, the high order terms in Eq.  (10.9)  can be 

neglected.  Then Eq.  (10.4)  can  be rewritten as

The summation  is  over  all  the  states in  the system  1.  The  normalization

p(E)  is  called the  canonical  distribution.  Using  the symbol of the trace Tr

(10.15) 

In  order  to  distinguish  with the statistical  average,  we  have  used  the  no(cid:173)

10.2.3  Average  using grand  canonical  distribution 

In Eq.  (10.20), the partition function  Z  depends on the number of particles 
N.  There  are  cases  that  calculations  are  made  easy  if  we  write  the  N 
dependence of partition function  Z  explicitly.  We  denote N as the average 
number of particles in the system.  Since the fluctuation of particle number 
is  small for  a  macroscopic system, we  can expand ln Z  at N.  We  have 

ln Z(N)  =  ln Z(N + ~N) 
= lnZ(N) +  aN

w= 8~ (-~In z) I",~, 

Then Eq.  (10.11)  becomes 

p(En, N)  = Z(N)- 1e11f3LJ.N e-f3En

Thus  the  probability  for  a  system  that  particle  number  is  changeable  is 
given  by 

To simplify the notation, p(En, N)  is  often denoted  as Pn,N· 

We  usually call  a  set of identical systems contacted with particle reser(cid:173)

are  called  the  open  systems.  p( En, N)  is  thus  called  the  grand  canonical

Then the average value of an observable A is  given by 

A= Tr(fJcA). 

(10.28) 
The trace here  is  to  be  understood  as  a  double  summations EN Tr.  The 
first  summation Tr is  over the state for  a  fixed  particle number  N  and the 
second is  over all the particle numbers N  = 0, 1, 2, · · ·.

boundary  condition  ¢'(x, (3)  =  ¢(x, 0).  In  comparison with  the transition 
amplitude,  Eq.  (10.30)  can be obtained by simply  replacing the time t  by 
-if3 in the transition amplitude and summing over 1¢, 0)  with the condition 
¢((3)  =  ¢(0).  Thus the functional  integral formalism  of the partition func(cid:173)
tion is equivalent to the Euclidean quantum field  formalism with 0 < T  < f3 
and the periodic boundary condition imposed. 

In  Eq.  (10.30),  we  have  used  the  Lagrangian  of the  boson  field.  The 
functional  representation for  the fermion  field  can be given  similarly.  One 
can  obtain  the  functional  representation  for  the  fermion  field  by  simply 
replacing  the  Lagrangian  of the  boson  field  by  that  of the  fermion  field. 
Also,  we  can  use  the  Hamiltonian  of quantum  mechanics  and  obtain the 
partition function  when quantum mechanics is  applicable.

In statistical mechanics,  we  deal with the many-particle systems.  We  usu(cid:173)

10.4  First  law  of thermodynamics 

Let  us  consider the properties of the macroscopic systems.  The properties 
of the  macroscopic  systems  are  described  by a  set  macroscopic  quantities 
such as temperature, entropy, etc.  The relations of macroscopic quantities 
are determined  by the  laws  of thermodynamics.  We  will  derive these  laws 
of thermodynamics from  the principle of statistical mechanics. 

We  consider an equilibrium system.  We  denote the probability for  the 
system in the stater as Pr·  The average energy of the system is  given by 

r 

(10.32) 

The  energy  can  be  changed  with  a  small  external  disturbance.  The 

variation of the energy can be written as 

(10.33) 

r 

r 

The  second  term  comes  from  the  change  of  Er.  Er  is  the  energy  of  a 
quantum  state  which  can  only  be  changed  by  applying  an  external  field. 
This  way  of changing  energy  is  called  performing  work.  The  change  of 
energy from  the  first  term  is  caused  by the  change of Pr·  Since  Er  is  not 
changed,  there  is  no  work  done  on  the  system.  In  this  case,  the  way  of 
changing energy is  called  heat transfer.  We  define the heat transfer a Q by 
(10.34) 

r 

The second term in Eq.  (10.33)  corresponds to the work performed on the 
system.  We  denote the work performed on the system by aW.  Then 

(10.35) 

r 

The small  bar is  added  in  the  symbols a W  and a Q because  the work  W 
and  heat  Q are  not  state functions.  a w  and a Q depend  on  the  process. 
In terms of aW and aQ,  Eq.  (10.33)  becomes 
dE=aQ+aW. 

(10.36) 

258 

Principles  of Physics 

Eq.  (10.36)  is  the so-called  first  law  of thermodynamics.  It states that for 
any  process  of a  macroscopic  system,  the  variation  of the energy  is  equal 
to the  sum of the  adsorbed  heat  and the work  performed  by  the  external 
fields. 

The energy Er  is  a function of the parameters Yi  related to the external 

fields. 

Yi  (i  = 1, 2, · · · , n)  are often  called  the  generalized  coordinates  in  thermo(cid:173)

Yi  is  called  the  generalized  force.  Eq.  (10.38)  shows  that  the  work  done 
on  the  system  is  equal  to  the  generalized  force  times  the variation  of the 
generalized coordinate.  For example,  the general coordinate is  the volume 
V  for  a hydrodynamic system.  The work done on a system is equal to force 
times displacement.  We  define  pressure P  as  the force  on a  unit  area.  We 
denote the displacement of area ds by dx.  Then work done on the system 
is  given  by 

aW= I Pds·dx=-PdV. 

(10.40) 

In  the  hydrodynamic  systems,  the  generalized  force  corresponds  to  the 
negative pressure.

10.5.1  Entropy increase  principle 

Let  us  consider  an  isolated  macroscopic  system  with  the  energy  E  and 
volume V.  For a  macroscopic system,  we can divide the system into small 
parts  (macroscopically  small,  but  still  microscopically  large).  We  divide 
the system into  N  parts  (we  call  them  subsystems)  with  the same volume 
v  =  V / N.  We  use  ni  to  denote the  number  of the  subsystems  taking the 
energy  Ei.  Each energy  Ei  has  a  degeneracy ni.  Then  the  number  of the 
microscopic states of the subsystem with the energy Ei  is ni.  For an isolated 
system,  we  have the following  constrained relations: 

(10.41a) 

(10.41 b) 

We  call the distribution  { ni} as  a  macroscopic  state  of the system with N 
subsystems. 

Now we calculate the number of the microscopic states n{nd for  a sys(cid:173)
tem taking a  macroscopic state {ni}·  n{ni} is  just the number of different 
possible ways to select n 1  subsystems taking energy c1 ,  n 2  subsystems tak(cid:173)

There are

ability to evolve  into the most  probable state.  Thus the equilibrium state 
should  be the  most  probable state  {ni}m·  Since  there  are  two  constraint 
conditions given  by Eq.  (10.41),  we  use the Lagrange multiplier method to 
determine the most probable state.  We  introduce two Lagrange multipliers 
a  and  (3  for  the  constraint  conditions  Eqs.  (10.41a)  and  (10.41b),  respec(cid:173)

Since  the  entropy  is  given  by  S  =  k ln n,  the  most  probable  state  is

Eq.  (10.53)  is  the  co-called  principle  of  entropy  increase  or  Clausius

for  the  second law  of thermodynamics.  The second law of thermodynamics 
have many equivalent formulations.  Any formulation showing the evolving

In Eq.  (10.62),  Zsub  and Esub  are the partition function and average energy 
of one  subsystem.  N  is  the  number  of subsystems.  We  have  shown  that 
In Z  is  an extensive quantity.  Thus we  have 
S  = k(In Z + f3E),

where  Z  is  the partition function  of the system  and  E  is  the total energy 
of the system.  Eq.  (10.63)  shows that Sis an extensive quantity. 

If we  calculate the average of Pi,  we  have 

ln p  =  In ( z-1e-,8Ei)  =  -In z- f3E.

10.5.4  Kelvin formulation  of the  second  law  of 

thermodynamics 

The second law of thermodynamics determines the direction of irreversible 
processes.  There  are  infinite  kinds  of irreversible  processes.  Thus we  can 
have  infinite  kinds  of formulations  of the  second  law  of thermodynamics. 
They  are  all  equivalent.  We  have  shown  that  ~S 2::  0  for  a  process  in  an 
isolated system.  Now we will show another formulation of the second law of 
thermodynamics,  the Kelvin  formulation:  There exists no  thermodynamic 
transformation  whose  sole  effect  is  to  convert  entirely  a  quantity  of heat 
from  a  heat reservoir into work.  We  will  prove the Kevin formulation from 
the entropy increase principle. 

We  consider  a  heat  machine  as  shown  in  Fig.  10.1.  There  are  two 

processes  supposed  to  be  operated  by  the  heat  machine.  One  is  the  nor(cid:173)
mal  process.  In  this  process,  the  work  w  is  transferred  into  heat  q  by  a 
machine  and  released  into  the  heat  reservoir.  The conservation  of energy 
demands  q  =  w.  The second  process  is  the reverse  process.  In the reverse 
process,  the heat in the heat reservoir is  transferred into work and released 
to  outside.  The  Kelvin  formulation  is  equivalent  to  the  statement  that 
the reverse process is  not  possible.  We  will  prove the Kelvin  statement  by 
reductio  ad  absurdum.  Suppose  that  the  Kelvin  formulation  is  false.  The 
reverse  process  is  possible.  We  evaluate  the  change of entropy  ~S in  the 
reverse process.  There are three parts:  the machine, the heat reservoir, the 
outside.  (i)  The  machine  returns  to  its  starting  position  after  a  cycle  of 
operation.  We  have the  change of the entropy ~Sm = 0  (ii)  Only work is 
released to the outside.  We  have the change of the entropy ~So = 0.  (iii) 
The  heat  reservoir  release  a  quantity  of heat  q.  Thus  the  change  of the 
entropy is  given  by  ~Sr =  aQjT =  -qjT.  Then the total  change of the 
entropy 

This is  in contradiction with the entropy increase principle.  Therefore, the 
reverse process is  not  possible and the Kelvin  formulation  must  be true.

ates between two heat reservoirs.  It absorbs heat q1  from the high temper(cid:173)
ature reservoir and transfer the heat into work w.  According to the Kelvin 
statement, the machine can not transfer the entire heat into work.  It should 
release some  heat  q2  into the low  temperature reservoir.  The conservation 
of energy demands w  =  q1 - q2.  Using  /::iS~ 0,  we  have

10.5.6  Clausius  inequality 

We  examine a system in contact with a heat reservoir.  The temperature of 
the heat reservoir is  T.  The system absorbs an amount of heat aQ.  When 
the  heat  reservoir  is  large,  the heat  releasing process of the heat  reservoir 
can  be  considered  as  a  quasi-static  process.  However,  the  process  in  the 
system is  not a quasi-static process generally.  The change of entropy in the 
heat reservoir is  given  by 

(10.79) 

We  denote  dS  as  the  change of entropy in  the system.  Then the total 

change of the entropy is  given  by 

aQ 
dSt  = dS + dSr  = dS - T  ·

The  heat  reservoir  and  the  system  together  can  be  considered  as  an

10.5. 7  Characteristic  functions 

We  define the free  energy  F  by 

F  = E  -TS. 

(10.84) 

Using Eq.  (10.63),  we  have 

F  =  -kTlnZ. 

(10.85) 

F  is  also called the Helmholtz free  energy.  The variation of the free  energy 
is  given  by 

dF = -SdT- PdV. 

(10.86) 

We  call  the  replacement  E  by  F  =  E  - T S  as  a  Legendre  transforma(cid:173)
tion.  The  term  TdS  in  Eq.  (10.74)  is  replaced  by  -SdT in  Eq.  (10.86). 
Eq.  (10.74)  is  often  used  when  S  and  V  are  independent  variables  while 
Eq.  (10.86)  is  used  when  T  and  V  are  independent  variables.  When  a 
function  with  suitable  variables  (so-called  natural  variables)  contains  all 
thermodynamic information, we  call this function  as  a  characteristic func(cid:173)
tion.  E(S, V)  is  such a  function.  We  can obtain all  other thermodynamic 
functions  when we  know the function  E(S, V).  From Eq.  (10.74),  we  have 

(10.87) 

The equation of state P = (V, T)  can be obtained by eliminating the vari(cid:173)
able  S  in Eq.  (10.87).  Therefore,  E(S, V)  is  a characteristic function. 

F(T, V) is  also a characteristic function.  There are two other important 
characteristic  functions  which  can  be  constructed  through  the  Legendre 
transformation.  One is  the  enthalpy  defined  by 

H=E+PV. 

(10.88) 

H ( S, P)  is  a characteristic function  with the variables S  and  P.  The other 
is  the  Gibbs  free  energy  defined  by 

G = F + PV = E  - T S + PV.

G(T, P)  is  a  characteristic function  with the variables T  and P.

dF =  -SdT - PdV, 
dG  =  -SdT + VdP.

10.5.9  Gibbs-Duhem  relation 

One of the most important functions in statistical mechanics is the chemical 
potential J-l  defined  by Eq.  (10.23) 

I"= a~ ( -~ lnZ) lv.p  =  ;~ lv.r. 

(10.93) 

According  to  Eq.  (10.60),  F(T, V, N)  is  an  extensive  quantity  with  the 
property 

F(T,aV,aN) = aF(T, V,N), 

(10.94) 
where a  is  a  factor  by which the system is  enlarged.  Since T  = 8Ej8S, T 
is  not  changed  by enlarging the system.  We  call T  as  intensive  quantity. 

270 

Principles  of Physics 

Differentiating Eq.  (10.94)  with respect to a  and then setting a= 1,  we

(10.95)

Eq.  (10.96)  is  called  the  Gibbs-Duhem  relation.  Using  Eq.  (10.96),  we

E  =  TS- PV + f-LN. 

(10.97) 
which  shows  that  the  chemical  potential  M is  the  Gibbs  free  energy  per 
particle. 

G = E  -TS + PV = f-LN, 

10.5.10 

Isothermal  processes 

We have shown that in an isolated system, the entropy of the system always 
increases.  It reaches  its  maximin when  the system  reaches  its equilibrium 
state. 

When the system is  in contact with a heat reservoir and is  not isolated, 
we  have  other  criteria  to  determine  the  process  direction.  For  a  system 
with constant temperature T  and volume V, we  have 

~F = ~(E-TS) 
= ~E-T~S 
= ~Q+~W-T~S 
= ~Q -T~S 
::;  0. 

(10.98) 
In the derivation,  we  have  used  ~ W  =  0  because V  =  canst.  Eq.  (10.98) 
shows that an isothermal and isochoral process takes the direction that the 
free  energy F  decreases. 

For a  system with constant temperature T  and pressure  P, we  have 

~G =  ~(E- TS + PV) 

= ~Q + ~W- T~S- P~V 
= ~Q -T~S 
::;  0. 

(10.99) 
Eq. (10.99) states that an isothermal and isobaric process takes the direction 
that the Gibbs free  energy G decreases.

10.5.11  Derivatives  of thermodynamic  quantities 

In this section, we  will introduce several important thermodynamic deriva(cid:173)
tives.  We  define  the heat  capacity  by 

Cx  ==  ~~~x. 

(10.100) 

The  specific  heat  capacity  is  the  heat  capacity  per  unit  mass.  Since  a Q 
depends  on  the  path of a  process,  the  heat  capacity also  depends  on  the 
path of process.  For an adiabatic process, a Q = 0.  Thus the adiabatic heat 
capacity Cs  =  0.  For  an isothermal process,  dT =  0.  Then the isothermal 
heat  capacity Cr  =  oo.  The  two  most  important  heat  capacities  are  the 
heat  capacity Cv  at constant  V  and the heat  capacity C p  at constant  P. 
They can be expressed as  the derivatives of state functions

Other important thermodynamic derivatives include the compressibility, 
the  coefficient  of thermal expansion,  and the  thermal  pressure coefficient. 
The  compressibility  is  defined  by

(10.108) 

The quantities such as  Kr show how the extensive quantities vary with the 
change of the intensive quantities.  We  also called them  susceptibilities. 

10.6  Third  law of thermodynamics 

When T  =  0,  the  value  of the  entropy  depends  on  the  degeneracy  of the 
ground state.  We  denote the degeneracy of the ground state energy  Eo  as 
no.  The density matrix of the canonical ensemble can be written as 

A 

e -f3ii 
p =  - - - - c - ,  
Tr e-f3H

-

no+ l:n e-f3(En-Eo) 

(10.109) 

where  JO)i  is  the  ith  degenerate ground  state.  Thus the entropy at T  =  0 
is  given  by 

S(T =  0)  =  -kTr(p ln p)  =  k ln no. 

(10.110) 

The ground  states of all  known  systems  are  found  to  have  degeneracy 

no= 0(1).  We  have 

lim  ksN  = o. 

T--+0 
N--+oo 

(10.111) 

Even if no= O(N), Eq.  (10.111)  is  still hold.  Eq.  (10.111)  is  not a  proved 
results.  It is  only  a  summary of known  properties  of  the  ground  states. 
Although Eq.  (10.111)  can not be  proven strictly,  it is  expected to be hold 
generally  because  all  the  calculation  results  on  the  ground  states  suggest 
the validity of Eq.  (10.111).  Eq.  (10.111)  is  called  Nernst's  theorem  or the 
third  law  of thermodynamics.  The  Nernst's  theorem  has  some  restrictions 
on the specific  heat capacity and other thermodynamic quantities.

tition  function  Z.  The  grand  partition  function  can  also  be  calculated 
using  Eq.  (10.127).  For  a  quantum  system,  the grand partition is  usually 
more easy to obtain.  Then the partition functions  can be calculated using 
Eq.  (10.130) from the grand partition function as the expansion coefficients.

For  a  system  with  multi-components,  we  denote  J-li  as  the  chemical  po(cid:173)
tential  of ith  component  ( i  =  1, · · ·  , n).  The  chemical  potential  term  in 
Eq.  (10.131)  should be replaced by a  summation over all components for  a 
multi-component system.  Then we  have 

dF = -SdT- PdV + L  J-lidNi.

Eq.  (10.132)  is  the  fundamental  thermodynamic  relation  for  the  open

SdT- v dP + L  NidJ-Li  =  0. 

(10.137) 

This is the differential Gibbs-Duhem relation.  In the case of one component, 
it shows  that T, P,  and  J-L  can not  be varied  independently.  We  have  only 
two independent variables for  a  homogeneous system with one component. 

10.9.2  Equilibrium  conditions  of two  systems 

Let us consider two macroscopic systems.  In the following,  we discuss what 
is  the conditions that these two systems are in equilibrium with each other. 
We  denote the two systems as  A1  and A2 .  The two systems A1  and A2  can 
be considered to form  an isolated  system  At  with  the total energy Et  and 
total volume Vt.  We  have two  constraint conditions 

(10.138a) 
(10.138b) 
If the particle number is  conserved,  we  have another constraint condition 
(10.139) 

Et  =  E1  +E2, 
Vt  =  v1  + v2. 

Nt  = N1  + N2. 

The number of microscopic states  flt  of the total system is  given  by 
flt(Et, vt, Nt)  =  fl1 (E1, V1, NI)fl2(E2, V2, N2) 

=  fl1 (E1, V1, NI)fl2(Et- E1, vt- V1, Nt- NI). 

(10.140) 
The equilibrium  state  is  the state with  the  maximum  entropy.  Thus  the 
equilibrium condition is 

8S = k8(ln flt)  = 0, 

(10.141) 

which gives

(10.144a) 
(10.144b) 
(10.144c) 

These  are  the  three equilibrium  conditions  between  two  macroscopic  sys(cid:173)
tems.  Eq.  (10.144a)  is  also called the zeroth  law  of thermodynamics,  which 
states that when two  systems are in thermal equilibrium with  a third sys(cid:173)
tem,  then they are in equilibrium with one another. 

10.9.3  Phase  equilibrium  conditions 

Let  us  consider  a  macroscopic  system.  When the system is  homogeneous, 
there is only one phase in the system.  If the system can be divided into two 
homogeneous parts, then there are two phases in the system.  For example, 
in the low  temperature,  the atoms arrange themselves orderly to form  the 
solid state to achieve the lowest energy.  With the increase of temperature, 
the entropy  begins  to  have  effect.  The entropy makes  the  system  become 
disordered.  When the temperature is  high enough,  the  solid  phase begins 
to melt into a disordered state (called liquid phase).  Then we have a system 
with two  phases. 

The equilibrium conditions for  two phases are similar to the equilibrium 
conditions Eq.  (10.144)  for  two systems.  We  can generalize Eq.  (10.144)  to 
a system of the r..p  phases with k components in each phase.  The equilibrium 
conditions  are given by 

Ta  = Tf3  = · · · = Tcp, 
Pa  =  Pf3  =  · · · =Pep, 
/-la,l  = J.-l(3,1  = · · · = /-lc.p,l, 

/-la,k  = /-l(3,k  = · · · = /-lcp,k·

Together  we  have  (k  +  2)('P- 1)  equations.  Since  the  concentrations  Xa,i 
satisfy the following  normalization condition 

Xa,l  +  Xa,2  +  · · · +  Xa,k  =  1, 

(10.146) 

we have 2'P+(k-1)'P =  (k+1)'P variables.  Then the number of independent 
variables( also called  freedom  number)  f  is  given  by 

f  =  (k +  1)'P- (k +  2)('P -1) =  k +  2- 'P  ~ 0. 

(10.14 7) 

Eq.  (10.147)  is  the  Gibbs  phase  rule.  For  a  system  with  one  component, 
there  are  only  pure phases.  From  Eq.  (10.147),  we  have  'P  :::;  3.  Thus the 
maximum number of the coexistent phases is three for  a pure phase system. 
For example, liquid water, water vapor, and one type of solid ice can coexist 
at  Tt  =  273.16  K  and  Pt  =  4.58  Torr.  The  coexistent  point  is  called  the 
triple point.  The absolute temperature scale  is  defined  by the triple point 
of water.  The  constant  k  in  S  =  ln 0  fixed  by  this  temperature  unit  is 
called the Boltzmann constant.  We  usually denote the Boltzmann constant 
as  kB. 

10.10  Equilibrium distributions of nearly independent 

particle systems 

Now  we  discuss  the  calculations  of the  thermodynamic  properties  of the 
systems  composed  of nearly independent  particles.  For  example,  in  a  gas, 
the distance between particles are large.  Thus the interaction of particles in 
such systems are weak and can be neglected.  When the interaction can be 
neglected,  the energy of the system can be described  by the single-particle 
energy.  We  can  then  use  the  distribution  functions  of  single  particle  to 
describe the statistical properties of the system.

10.10.1.1  Expressions  in  terms  of single  particle  quantities

of the  system.  For  a  system  on  the  state  s  with  particle  number  N  and

number of distinct ways of assigning the ni particles to gi degenerate states

the restriction on  { ni}',  we  can change the summations over  N  and  { ni}' 
to the summation over  { ni} without restriction.  Eq.  (10.155)  becomes

Bosons 

Principles  of Physics 

First  we  discuss  the system  with  bosons,  which  is  called  Bose  system. 
To  facilitate the calculations, we  use the graph in Fig.  10.3 to represent the 
configurations  of the  ni  particles  occupying  9i  quantum  states  of  Ei.  We 
use  circles  ( o)  to  represent  the  particles  and  squares  (D)  to  represent  the 
quantum states.  There are 9i  squares.  In Fig.  10.3, the circles on the right 
of the quantum state D  denote the particles occupying the quantum state 
on  their  left.  Since  every  particle  should  occupy  one  quantum  state,  the 
first  position on the left should be a quantum state represented by a square. 
As  an example,  the graph in  Fig.  10.3  represents  a  configuration that ten 
particles on an energy level with four quantum states.  In this configuration, 
there  are  two  particles  on  the  state  1,  zero  particle  on  the  state  2,  five 
particles on the state 3 and three particles on the state 4.  Let us  count the 
number of the distinct configurations of graphs, which gives the number ni 
of the different ways of assigning the ni-particles to the 9i  degenerate states 
of Ei.  Since  the  first  position  on  the  left  has  to  be  put  a  quantum  state, 
we  have  9i  selections.  There  are  ni  circles  and  9i  - 1 squares  left.  If the 
circles and squares were labeled, there would be  ( ni + 9i - 1)!  different ways 
to arrange them.  However,  the circles represent identical particles and are 
all  equivalent,  we  need  divide the configuration number  by the number  of 
the ways  permuting  particles  ( ni!  ways).  Likewise,  quantum states are all 
equivalent  and a  factor  gi!  should be divided.  We  have 
ni= 9i(ni+gi-1)! = (ni+gi-1)!.

Eq.  (10.182)  leads to the relation of the partition function  Z  of the system 
with the partition function  z of single particle for  the classical independent 
particle systems 

(10.185) 

When  the  particles  are  indistinguishable,  exchanging  two  particles  gives 
the  same  microscopic  state.  Since  exchanging  two  particles  on  the  same 
quantum state of Ei  also  gives  the same microscopic  state for  the classical 
system  with  distinguishable  particles,  we  need  to  exclude  this  possibility 
to simplify the calculation.  For the semi-classical case,  ni <<  gi,  we  do  not 
have  the  possibility  that  one  quantum  state is  occupied  by  two  particles. 
Since  exchanging  two  particles  gives  the same  microscopic  state,  we  need 
divide  a  factor  N!  which  is  the  number  of ways  of permuting  particles  in

It should  be noted  that Eq.  (10.186)  can not  be applied  to the general 
quantum  boson  and  fermion  systems.  For  a  boson  system,  one  quantum 
state can  be  occupied  by  more  than one  particles.  For  a  fermion  system, 
there is  a  limitation that one  quantum state can only  be  occupied  by one 
particle, the summation in Eq.  (10.186) is not independent for general boson 
and fermion  systems. 

10.10.3  About  summations  in  calculations  of independent 

particle  system 

For an independent particle system, the Hamiltonian of the system contains 
no interaction term.  There is  only kinetic term 

fi = H(p).

The summations involved  in the calculations of thermodynamic quantities 
often have the form 

L F(cs)  = Tr F(H)  = Tr F(H(p)).

The trace in Eq.  (10.188) can be transformed into integration in the f  space 
that spanned by the momentum p  and  position q.

10.11  Fluctuations 

The  thermodynamic  properties  of  a  macroscopic  system  are  determined 
by  the  statistical  average  of observables.  However,  there  are  always  fluc(cid:173)
tuations  around  the  average  for  a  finite  system.  Now  we  discuss  the 
fluctuations. 

10.11.1  Absolute  and relative  fluctuations 
For  a  physical  quantity  u,  its  deviation  from  the  average  is  b..u  = u- u. 
Since  u- u =  0,  we  define 

b..u = [(u- u) 2]

as the fluctuation of u.

b..u  is  called the  absolute  fluctuation.  The  relative  fluctuation  is  defined  as

10.12.1  Classic  limit  of statistical  distribution functions 

Now  we  consider the classical limit of the statistical distribution functions. 
The  classical  limit  corresponds  to  the  case  of  high  temperature  and  low 
densities. 

First we  consider the simplest  case,  i.e.  one  particle systems,  which  we 
do  not  need  deal  with  quantum  correlation.  Then  we  consider  realistic 
many-particle systems.  The Hamiltonian operator for  one particle systems 
is  given  by 

A2

fi = E_ + V(q) = K(f>) + V(q), 

(10.207) 
where f>  and q are the momentum and position operators respectively.  They 
obey the commutation relation Eq.  (6.103) 
[qi, Pi]  =  i!L 

(10.208) 

Their eigenstates are defined  by the following  equations: 

<li lqi)  = qi lqi), 
PiiPi)  =  PiiPi)· 

The normalization conditions for  the eigenstates are given by 

(q~ lqi)  = 6( q~ - qi), 
(p~ I Pi)  =  6 (p~ - Pi).

Principles  of Physics 

We  can  derive  following  relation  directly  from  the  commutation  relation 
Eq.  (10.208).

From commutation relation, we  have

(qiiPi)  =  ~eltPiQi.

q, exp ( -~q,p}o)q; 

=  [ q,, exp (-*q;]i;) ]IO)q; 
= q;exp ( -*q,p,) IO)q;· 

Thus the eigenstates of qi  are given by 

lq;)  = exp ( -~q,p,) IO)q;. 

Similarly,  we  can show that the eigenstates of Pi  are given by 

lp,)  = exp Gp,q}o)p;· 

Then we  can calculate  (qiiPi) 

(q,lp,)  =  (q,l exp Gp,q}o)p;

Ac(P, q) is the classical quantity corresponding to the the operator A(p, q).

In the  high  temperature  and  low  density,  the state of matter is  usually  a 
gas  due  to  the  entropy effect  which  prefers  a  disordered  state.  For  a  gas 
state,  the distance  between  molecules  are  much  larger than the  molecular 
size  in  average  and  thus  the  interaction  of molecules  are  small.  Now  we 
consider the properties of the ideal gas.  An ideal gas is  a  gas in which the 
interaction of molecules  can be neglected and the condition

which consist of atoms.  We  can divide the energy of the molecules into the 
part  of mass  center  and  the  part  of internal  degrees  of freedom,  which  is 
similar to  what  we  have  done  when  we  treat  the  Schrodinger  equation  of 
the  hydrogen  atom  in  quantum  mechanics.  When  the Hamiltonian He  of 
mass  center  and  the  Hamiltonian  Hi  of internal  degrees  of freedom  com(cid:173)
mute, they share the same eigenstates described by the same set of quantum 
numbers.  We  denote the energy of mass center  as  Ec  with the degeneracy 
9c  and the energy of internal degrees of freedom  as  Ei  with the degeneracy

Eq.  (11.10)  shows that the equation of state of an ideal gas is  independent

are same,  independent of the structures of molecules.

Ideal  gas  of single-atom molecules 

The  simplest  molecule  is  the  single-atom  molecule  in  which  there  is  only 
one  atom.  Since  the  excitation  energy  of electrons  is  in  order  of  e V  or 
104  K,  We  can  neglect  the  excitation  of electrons  and  consider  the  atom 
as  one single  particle.  Thus there is  no  internal degree  of freedom  for  the 
single-atom  molecules.  The  partition function  z  of single  particle  for  the 
ideal gas of single-atom molecules is equal to the partition function for  mass 
center.  We  have 

Then

(11.17) 

We can estimate ea  using Eq.  (11.17).  In the condition of room temperature 
and one  atmospheric pressure,  ea  ~ 105  ::?>  1.  Therefore,  the ordinary gas 
can be approximated as  an ideal gas.

It should  be noted that Eq.  (11.20)  is  also  applicable for  the ideal gases of

The entropy is  given  by 

(11.21) 

Eq.  (11.21)  is  called the Sackur- Tetrode  equation.  Eq.  (11.21)  shows that S 
is  an extensive quantity.  It should be noted that the term - ln N!  is crucial 
for  the entropy S  to  be  an extensive quantity.  The factor  N!  results  from 
the  indistinguishability  of the  particles.  Before  quantum  mechanics  was 
established,  the  particles  were  not  considered  as  indistinguishable,  which 
gives  an  entropy  formula  without  the  term  - ln N!.  Without  the  term 
-ln N!,  the entropy is  not an extensive quantity.  This is  so-called Gibbs's 
paradox.

Now  we  consider  the  contribution  from  the  internal  degrees  of  freedom. 
The partition function  for  the internal degrees of freedom  is  given  by 

(11.24) 

We  can image a  macroscopic system as  a  huge molecule  and  then con(cid:173)
sider that there are J.v1(J.v1  >>  1)  huge  molecules  to form  an ideal gas.  The 
thermodynamic properties of the system is determined by zi  in Eq.  ( 11.24). 

306

Physically,  this  is  equivalent  to  the  ensemble  method.  The ideal  gas  con(cid:173)
sisted of the macroscopic systems can be considered as an canonical ensem(cid:173)
ble.  For  these  systems,  Zi  is  then  the  canonical  partition  function  of the 
system. 

zi  can only be evaluated  analytically in  a  few  simple  cases.  In  the  fol(cid:173)

lowing,  we  will  deal  with  the  two-atom  molecules  as  an  example.  If we 
consider  atoms as  particles without  internal degrees of freedom,  each two(cid:173)
atom molecule has 3 + 3 = 6 degrees of freedom with three for  mass center 
motion, two for  rotations and one for  vibration.  Since the Hamiltonian op(cid:173)
erator for  rotation commutes with the Hamiltonian operator for  vibration, 
we  have 

(11.25) 
where  Er  is  the  eigenvalue  of energy  for  rotation  and  Ev  is  the  eigenvalue 
of energy for  vibration.  The total degeneracy gi  for  the internal degrees of

(11.26) 
where  9r  is  the  degeneracy  for  Er  and  9v  is  the  degeneracy  for  Ev·  Then

(11.36) 

Eq.  (11.36)  shows  that  the  heat  capacity of vibration  approaches  to  zero 
when T---+  0.  This  results  from  the quantum effect.  We  introduce  a  char(cid:173)

When T  <<  Bv,  which  is  the  low  temperature  region,  the vibration degree

is  the high temperature region,  the energy becomes

This  result  agrees with  the  equipartition theorem.  The heat  capacity Cv 
is  then equal to NkB.

than  the  thermal  de  Broglie  wave  length  of  particles,  the  particles  can 
be  considered  as  the  classical  particles.  Otherwise,  the waves  of particles 
interweaves and the quantum correlation plays role.  When e-a =  n.A~ < 1, 
the quantum correlation is  weak.  We  call this case the weakly  degenerate

The  lower  temperature  T,  the  larger  mass  m  and  the  higher  density 
n  give  larger  n,\~  and  thus  stronger  quantum  effect.  For  the  Bose  gas, 
Eq.  (11.78)  shows that the heat capacity Cv increases with the decrease of 
temperature T.  Since  Cv  should  become  zero  as  temperature approaches 
zero, we would expect that there are other mechanism making Cv decrease. 
Thus  there  should  be  a  peak  in  the  curve  of Cv  as  a  function  of T.  We 
will  show  that  there  is  a  phase transition  for  the  Bose  gas  in  the  follow(cid:173)
ing  section.  The  peak  of  Cv  corresponds  to  the  transition  point.  The 
heat capacity will  decrease with the decrease of temperature in the strong 
degenerate region below the transition temperature.

hand of Eq.  (11.86)  is  smaller than Nmax  given  by 

Nmax = Vg, C":~BT) ~ (G)= ~t'( G)()( vr!.  (11.94) 

With the decrease of temperature T, Nmax  becomes smaller than N  below a 
certain temperature Tc.  This situation is caused by the using of Eq.  (10.190) 
when  we  replace  the  summation with  integration.  The  contribution from 
the ground state E  =  0 does  not  appear  in  the integration since  g(O)  =  0. 
For bosons, there is  no  limitation on the number of particles in  a quantum 
state.  The lowest  state E  = 0 can  be  occupied  by  O(N)  particles.  In this 

Applications  of Statistical  Mechanics

case,  the  contribution  from  the  ground  state  can  not  be  neglected.  We 
should express explicitly the term that  accounts for  the contribution from 
the states= O(k  =  0).  Thus Eq.  (11.86)  should  be replaced  by

Tc  is  called  the  critical  temperature.  Above  Tc,  p,  >  0.  Below  Tc,  the 
chemical  potential  p,  = 0  and  all  orders  of its  derivatives  are  zero.  Thus 
T  =  Tc  is  a  point  with  singularity,  which  means  that  there  is  a  phase 
transition  at  T  =  Tc.  This  phase  transition  is  called  the  Bose-Einstein 
condensation  (BEC).  It can  be  seen  that  the  phase  transition  is  caused 
by the condensation on the ground state or  k = 0 state.  This transition is 
important for the properties of macroscopic systems at the low temperature. 
It transforms  a  classical  phase  of a  macroscopic  system  into  a  quantum 
phase which we  call the macroscopic quantum state.  This phase transition 
mechanism  is  also  responsible  for  the superfluidity of liquid  4He  and  3He, 
and superconductivity in solids. 

11.3.2  Thermodynamic  properties  of BEG 
After the Bose-Einstein condensation,  p,  = 0,  which gives 

G = p,N = E  + PV- ST = 0. 

(11.102) 

First  we  consider  the  contribution of the  ground  state c  =  0.  E  =  0  and 
S = 0 for  the ground state.  According to Eq.  (11.102),  we  have 

p  =

v

(11.103) 

Thus we can neglect the contributions of the ground state in the calculations 
of E,  P  and  S.  The  c  = 0  state  only  plays  the  role  as  a  particle  source.

11.4  Photon gas 

Now  we  study  the  photon  gas.  An  equilibrium  photon  gas  is  also  called 
the  black  body.  The  radiation emitted  from  a  small  opening  on  a  cavity 
can  be  approximately considered  as  a  black  body  radiation.  Photons  are 
massless  spin-1  vector  bosons.  There  are  almost  no  interaction  between 
photons.  Thus we  can  use  the  Bose  distribution for  independent  particles 
to  calculate  the  properties of the  photon gas.  Since  photons  do  not  have 
mass,  the particle number  of the photon gas  is  not  a  constant.  According 
to Eqs.  (10.93)  and (10.98), the equilibrium condition for  a photon gas with 
constant temperature T  and volume V  is 

I'= ;~I 

V,T 

=  0. 

(11.109) 

Thus  the  chemical  potential  of an  equilibrium  photon  gas  is  zero,  which 
gives a= -f3p =  0.  The Bose distribution for  photon gas becomes

(12.6) 

where  the  integral on  the  right  is  taken over  the surface  surrounding  the 
volume V.  Since the expression on the left is  the change rate of the energy 
contained  in  the  volume  V,  the  expression  on  the  right  is  the  amount  of 
energy transferred across the boundary of the volume V.  We define a vector 
s, 

(12. 7) 

From Eq.  (12.6),  we  can see that Sis the amount of energy passing though 
unit surface in  unit time.  Thus S  is  called the flux  density  of energy. 

Eq.  (12.2) shows that~ is the momentum density.  Thus the flux density 
of energy  is  equal  to  the  momentum  density  multiplied  by  c2 .  Now  we 
consider the second equation in Eq.  (12.4).  We  have 

~ J ~yiodV =-J aTi~ dV

(12.8) 

The term on the left is the change of the momentum of the system in V  per 
unit time.  Therefore,  j Tij dsi  is the momentum leaving the system in V  per 
unit time.  The components yij of the energy-momentum tensor constitute 
the three-dimensional tensor of momentum flux  density,  which  we  denote 
as  -O'ij·  O'ij  is  also  called  the  stress  tensor,  which  has  the  meaning  that 
the component O'ij  is the amount of i-component of the momentum passing 
though unit surface perpendicular to the xJ  axis per unit time (the direction 
entering the system is taken as positive)  according to Eq.  (12.8).  Thus T 11v 
can be expressed as  the following  matrix

is  the i-component of the force  acting on the surface element.  Now  we  use 
the  reference  system  in  which  the  elements  of volume  of the  system  are 
at  rest.  For  an equilibrium hydrodynamic system,  the pressure P  is  equal 
everywhere.  The pressure P  has  the meaning of being the force  acting on 
unit surface element.  We  have

that the volume element here is  the one in the reference frame in which the 
corresponding  portion  of body  is  at  rest.  We  call  such  volume  as  proper 
volume.  Thus in the reference frame that the system is  at rest, the energy(cid:173)

We  can  use  tensor  transformation  to  obtain  the  expression  for  the 
energy-momentum  tensor  in  an  arbitrary  reference  frame.  We  introduce 
the four-velocity  defined  by Eq.  (A.34)  in the Appendix A  to describe the 
macroscopic  motion  of a  body  element.  In  the  rest  frame,  ua  =  (c, 0).

12.4  Spherical solutions for  stars 

12.4.1  Spherically  symmetric  spacetime 

Spherically  symmetric  systems  are  the  most  important  gravitational  sys(cid:173)
tems  because point-like  particles and spherical stars are described  by such 
systems. 

12.4.1.1  Minkowski  spacetime  in  the  spherical  coordinates 

Minkowski  spacetime is  a  flat  spacetime with  the  spherical symmetry.  In 
the  spherical  coordinates,  the  line  element  of the  :Minkowski  spacetime  is 
given  by 

(12.119) 

The surface of constant t  and  r  is  a  two  dimensional  spherical surface, 
which  is  often  called  two-sphere  in  a  simple  notation.  Distances  dl  along 
curves  on  the  two-sphere  are  given  by  Eq.  (12.119)  with  the  constraint 
dt = dr = 0. 

(12.120) 
where the symbol dfJ 2  defines the element of solid  angle.  A two-sphere has 
circumference 27rr  and area 47rr 2

• 

12.4.1.2  Spherically  symmetric  metric 

For a Riemann spacetime with spherical symmetry, every point of spacetime 
should be on a  two-sphere,  whose  line element  is  given by 

(12.121) 

344 

Principles  of Physics 

where  f ( r', t)  is  a  function  of two  other  coordinates  r'  and  t.  The  area 
of each two-sphere is  4rr f ( r', t).  We  can make a  coordinate transformation 
from  (r', t) to (r, t)  in such a way f(r', t)  =  r 2
.  Then in the new coordinates 
r  and  t,  the  area  of  a  two-sphere  is  4rrr 2  and  circumference  2rrr.  This 
coordinate r  is called the curvature coordinate or area  coordinate.  It should 
be noted that generally,  r  is  not the distance from  the center of the sphere 
to its surface in the Riemann spacetime. 

Now  we  consider  the spheres  at r  and  r + dr.  Each sphere has a  coor(cid:173)
dinate system  ( e, ¢).  We  demand  that  a  line with e =const and ¢  =const 
is  orthogonal to the two-spheres, which requires er · ee  =  er · e¢ =  0.  Thus 
we  have gre  =  gr¢  =  0.  Then the metric with spherical symmetry has the 
form 

ds 2  = g00 dt 2 + 2gordtdr + 2goedtde 
+ 2go¢dtd¢ + grrdr 2  + r 2 d0 2

(12.122) 
Similarly, we consider the spheres at t  and t+dt.  The line with r  =const, 
e =const and¢ =const should also be orthogonal to the two-spheres, which 
requires et · ee  =  et · e¢  =  0 or gte  =  gt¢  =  0.  Then Eq.  (12.122)  becomes 
(12.123) 

ds 2  = goo(r, t)dt 2  + 2gor(r, t)dtdr + grr(r, t)dr 2  + r 2 d0 2

. 

. 

This is  the general form  of a  spherically symmetric metric. 

12.4.1.3  Spherically  symmetric metric for  static  systems 

Now  we  consider  the  static  systems.  For  a  static  system,  the  energy(cid:173)
momentum tensor is  independent of time t.  Thus the metric can be chosen 
to be static, i.e.  a  metric components are independent of timet.  Since the 
energy-momentum tensor  has the time reversal symmetry, the geometry is 
not changed by time reversal, t-+ -t.  The metric should be unchanged by 
the  coordinate transformation  (t, r, e, ¢)  -+  ( -t, r, e, ¢ ).  We  have  gor  =  0. 
The causality principle demands that g00  < 0 and grr  > 0.  Then the metric 
of a  static spacetime with the spherical symmetry is  given by 

ds 2  = -e2

12.4.1.5  Gravitational  redshift 

We  have shown that  any  particle  moving  along  a  geodesic  has  a  constant 
energy  E  =  -p0c.  However,  a  local  inertia  observer  at  rest  measures  a 
different  energy.  When  one  is  at  rest,  ui  =  ~~i  =  0.  From  the  condition 
uJ.tuJL  =  -c2,  we  have  u0  =  ce-<P.  According  to  Eq.  (12.48),  the  energy 
measured by the local observer at  rest is 

(12.129) 

Considering  the  asymptotic  flat  condition  Eq.  (12.126),  e-<P  =  1  as 
r--+  oo.  It can  be seen that E  is  the energy that a  distant observer would 
measure  when  the  particle  gets  there.  For  a  star,  in  the weak  field  limit, 
e 2<~>  =  1 +  ~ according  to  Eq.  (12.106).  Thus  <I>  ~ ~ <  0.  We  have 
e-<P  > 1.  Then Eq.  (12.129)  shows that the particle has  larger energy from 
the view  point  of local  inertial  observer.  This  extra energy  is  the  kinetic 
energy gained by falling  in a  gravitational field. 

When  this  is  applied  to  photons,  we  get  an  important  physical  phe(cid:173)

nomenon  called  gravitational  redshift.  We  consider  a  photon  emitted  at 
radius r 1 and received at r 2.  We  denote Vr 1  the frequency of the photon at 
r1  in the local inertial frame,  then its local energy is  hvr 1  and its conserved 
constant  E  is  hvr 1  exp (<I>(rl)).  When the photon reaches the radius  r 2, it 
is  measured to have energy

nonzero component u0 .  Using the formula uJ-luJ-I  = -c2 ,  we  have

In  the  energy-momentum  tensor,  which  is  often  called  the  stress-energy 
tensor  for  a  fluid,  there  are two  thermodynamic  variables  P  and  p.  From 
statistical mechanics,  we  can obtain a  relation between them 

P =  P(p,T).

Eq.  (12.136)  is  the equation of state.  When the temperature T  is  low,  we 
have 

p  = P(p).

condition.  u 0  has  only geometric  meaning.  In the  Newtonian  approxima(cid:173)
tion,  it  can  be  shown  u0  =  0.  Then  u(r)  is  the  mass.  In  the  case  of the

Due to the symmetry,  (B, B)  and(¢,¢) components can be derived from

tions  (Eqs.  (12.137),  (12.139),  (12.140)  and  (12.143))  with  four  functions 
(P(r),p(r),<P(r)  and  u(r)).  We  can solve  the  equations  to  obtain the four 
functions  P(r),p(r),<P(r)  and u(r). 

Generally, we  use the boundary conditions at the boundary of the star,

Minkowski  metric  is  also  the  vacuum  metric.  When  the  whole  space  is 
vacuum,  the  only  physical  solution  is  the  Minkowski  metric.  When  the 
space contains a star with the spherical symmetry,  the physical solution is 
the Schwarzschild metric.  Therefore,  Schwarzschild  metric  should be  used 
for  r  >  R outside the star with the radius of R  =  rb.  It can not be used for

conditions  for  the  integration from  the  center of the  star;  The  other  is  to 
use the boundary conditions for  the integration from  the boundary of the 
star.  In the  first  case,  we  use  u(r  =  0)  and  P(r =  0)  as  the  initial  values 
of integration.  Solving  e- 2A  from  the equation u(r)  =  ~fr(1- e- 2A),  we 
have 

_ 2A

(12.150) 
Since  9rr  =  e2A  is  positive,  we  have  u(O)  ::;  0.  If u(O)  -=/=  0,  e- 2A  will 
approach infinite at the origin r  =  0.  From Eq.  (12.149),  around the origin 
r  =  0,  we  have

•  When  s  <  1, 
where  we  have expressed  the  equation of state as  p =  nP8
the solution of Eq.  (12.151)  is  pl-s ~ ~c2 n(1- s) In r + c,  which will result 
in  a  negative p  when r--+ 0.  Thus u(O)  can only be zero for  a  star without 
a  void.  When  s  2:  1,  we  have  P  r-v  cr.  Then  Pfr=O  =  0.  It  is  possible that 
u(O)  can be nonzero in this case.  Since for  most  kinds of cold stars, s < 1. 
We will mainly focus on the case of s < 1, which is  applicable for  most star 
matters.  We  can rewrite the solution of Eq.  (12.151)  as  follows, 

2 

ri 

pl-s =  ~c2n(1 - s) In(!:___)  . 

(12.152) 
We  find  that  P  = 0  at  r  = ri.  If we  consider r  = ri  as  an inner  boundary, 
P  will  remain  zero  when  r  ::;  ri  and  we  could  avoid  a  negative  p.  Thus, 
we  have  another  type of solutions  with  Pi  = 0  at  r  = ri.  Since  p = 0  for 
r  ::;  ri, there is  a void around r  = 0 for  this type of solutions.  The solutions 
satisfy  the  Einstein  equations.  From  r  = 0  to  r  = ri,  p  = 0  and  P  =  0. 
There  are  no  particles  and  thus  pressure  is  zero  in  this  void  region.  The 
initial condition for this type of solutions should take the values at the inner 
radius  r  =  ri  instead  of r  =  0.  The  differential  equations  can  be  solved 
by integrating from the initial values.  The outer radius r o  is  reached when 
P=O. 

Outside  the  star,  the  metric  is  the  Schwarzschild  metric.  The  metric 

functions  must  be continuous at r  =  r 0 •  Inside the star, the metric is

Outside the star, we  have

The continuity of the metric demands 

M  =  u(r0 ). 

Thus the gravitational mass of the star is  determined  by 

M  = 1~o dr41rr2 p + u(r,). 

(12.154) 

(12.155) 

(12.156) 

In the weak  field  limit,  ri  =  0  and  u(ri)  =  0.  The gravitational mass 
in  Eq.  (12.156)  is  just  the  mass  of the  star.  It  should  be  noted  that  we 
always  have  ¥fu(r) < r  for  stars.  If it ever happened that r- ¥fu(r) = E 
is  small  near  some  radius  r 1  and  decrease  with  the  change of r,  from  the 
TOV equation Eq.  (12.149),  the pressure gradient  ~~ could  be of order  ~ 
and negative.  This would leads to the rapid decrease of the pressure P  and 
drop to  zero  before  E  reaches  zero.  At  P  = 0,  we  reach the  surface of the 
star.  Outside the star,  u  is  constant  and  r  increases.  Thus  u(r)  of a  star 
can not  reach  ~cr. 

2 

We can also solve the differential equation using the boundary conditions 
at  the  outer  surface  of the  star.  We  have  the  initial  values  of u(ro)  and 
P  =  0  at  r  =  r 0 • 
Integrating  from  the  surface  of the  star  to  the  inner 
center,  we  can  solve  the  TOV  equations.  We  could  obtain  two  types  of 
solutions:  solutions  without  void  and  those  with  void,  without  assuming 
that there is  a void inside  a priori.  The solutions with void can only occur 
in strong field.  In the weak field  limit  , there are only the solutions without 
void.

The  TOV  equation  is  hard  to  solve  analytically  for  a  given  equation  of

To  simplify the problem, we  consider the approximation

inside  the  star  with  a  radius  of  R.  This  approximation  is  proposed  by 
Schwarzschild.  It should  be  noted  that  the  speed  of  sound  V 8  which  is 
proportional to  ( 1{p) ~  1  is  infinite.  Thus  it  has  the  problem  of causality.

12.5  White dwarfs 

When a  star with about a  mass of the sun runs out of the reaction energy, 
the  pressure  in  the  star  resulted  from  the  thermal  effect  becomes  small. 
Then  the  pressure  resulted  from  the  quantum  effect  of  fermions  due  to 
the  Pauli  exclusion  principle  dominates.  White  dwarfs  are  stars that  the 
outwards pressure is  delivered  by the cold  electron gas.  Since  the mass  of 
electrons is  much smaller than the mass of nuclei  (mass of four  protons for 
helium),  the pressure of electrons is  larger than that of nuclei.  This can be 
seen from  the following  derivations. 

The pressure increases with the mass of star.  We  consider the limit case 
that the pressure of electron gas can resist the gravitational potential.  We 
denote the total mass of the star by M  and the radius of the star by R.  We 
have 

M  = (me+ 2mp)N ~ 2mpN, 
R=(!~)I 

(12.193a)

(i)  When the mass of the star is  not very large, the nonrelativistic limit 
(xp  <<  1)  can  be  used.  Then  we  can  use  the  relation  Eq.  (12.198)  to

Thus the radius  of the  star decreases with the increase of the mass  of the 
star.  Eq.  (12.196b)  shows that the radius of the star would be smaller if we 
replace electron mass with proton mass.  The effect  of pressure of electrons 
is  stronger than  that  of nuclei  and  thus  it  is  reasonable that  we  consider 
only the pressure of electrons. 

(ii)  When the mass of the star is  large enough,  the extreme relativistic 

limit  (xp  >>  1)  should be used.  The equilibrium condition is  given  by

where  8  is  the  mass  of the  sun.  According  to  Eq.  (12.208),  we  can  see 
that  R--+  0  as  M  --+  M0 .  Thus  Newtonian  gravitational theory can  have 
gravitational collapse.  In contrast,  if one  uses  the TOV equation,  as  mass 
increases, R would not approach zero.  Instead, R  approaches a finite value. 

General  Relativity 

359 

Therefore, the general relativity does not have the similar gravitational col(cid:173)
lapse as  predicted  by the Newtonian gravitational theory.  The underlying 
physics  is  that the general relativity allows  only positive  energy while  the 
energy in the Newtonian gravitational theory can be negative and without 
a  lowest  limit. 

More  refined  calculations  give  the  result  Mo  =  1.4M0 .  This  value  of 
mass  is  called  the  Chandrasekhar  limit.  When  the  mass  of  the  star  is 
larger  than  the  Chandrasekhar limit,  it  will  collapse  until  other  repulsive 
mechanism  is  effective  or  the  Newtonian  gravitational  theory  is  no  more 
applicable. 

12.6  Neutron  Stars 

When  a  white  dwarf  is  further  compressed,  the  electrons  could  combine 
with the protons to release the energy.  The final  equilibrium stars are the 
neutron stars.  For the neutron stars, the gravitation effect  is  so  large that 
the Newtonian gravitational theory is  no  more applicable.  We  will  use the 
TOY equation to calculate the interior structure of neutron stars. 

For  the  neutron  stars,  there  are  two  types  of solutions.  The solutions 
without void and the ones with void.  First we consider the solutions without 
void,  which we  call the normal solutions. 

12.6.1  Normal  solutions 

Eqs.  ( 12.140)  and  ( 12.149)  are the two first-order differential equations for 
solving u(r)  and P(r).  They are

We  denote the radius of the neutron star as  R.  One can integrate the two 
equations  simultaneously  from  some  initial  values  u  =  u0  and  P  =  Po  at 
r  =  0 to the values  at r  =  R where P  =  0.  The value of u  at the boundary 
r  =  R  is  connected  with the value of the Schwarzschild  metric outside the 
star.  We  have 

u(r) = - (1- e-2A)  = - 1- 1- - - =  Af

Thus u(R)  is  the gravitational mass  of the neutron star as  measured by a 
distant observer. 

For  a  neutron  star  consists  of the  particles  with  the  rest  mass  of mn 

obeying the Fermi-Dirac statistics, it is more convenient to use the paramet(cid:173)
ric  form  of p and P  with the parameter ~ related to the Fermi momentum 
PF  by Eq.  (12.189) 

Then the energy density and pressure are given  by

where  K  =  1rm~c3 /(4h3 ).  The  Fermi  momentum  PF  is  related  to  the 
density of the particle number n  =  NjV by n  =  87rp~/(3h3 ). 

There  are  some  restrictions  on  the  choice  of  Po  and  u0 .  First  only

positive,  we  have  u0  ::;  0.  Eq.  (12.141)  shows  that  u 0  =  0  if e- 2A  takes 
finite  value.  If u 0  =I=  0,  we  express  the  equation  of state  by  p  =  aPs  at 
r  ~ 0.  If Po  =I=  0,  s =  0.  If Po  =  0,  s =  t(Expanding Eq.  (12.190)  at~= 0 
gives  P  r-v  pi).  According  to  Eq.  (12.151),  p1-s  ~ 1/2c2a(1  - s) ln r +  c, 
which will  result  in  a  negative p when r ---+  0.  Thus u(O)  can only be zero. 
We  can  use  ~  as  the  parameter  in  solving  the  differential  equations.

12.6.2  Solutions  with void 

Now  we  consider  the  solution  with  void.  We  have  shown  that  the  initial 
::;  0.  When  u0  <  0,  near  1  =  0,  the  TOV  equation  becomes 
value  u0 
Eq.  (12.151).  The solution of Eq.  (12.151)  can be rewritten as 

(12.218) 

We can see that P  =  0 ar 1  =  li·  If we consider 1  =lias an inner boundary, 
P  will  remain  zero  when  1  ::;  li and  we  would  avoid  a  negative  P.  Thus, 
we  have  another  type of solutions  with  P  =  0  at  1  =  li.  Since  p  =  0  for 
1  ::;  li, there  is  a  void  around  1  =  0  in  this  type  of solutions.  In the void 
region  from  1  =  0 to  1  =  1 i,  p =  0 and  P  =  0.  There are no  particles and 
thus  pressure is  zero  in this void  region. 

In the void  region,  we  have the Minkowski-type metric 

(12.219) 

where  A= e2<Pi  and  B  =  (1- 2Gui/c21i)- 1  are constants.  The parameter 
<I>i  can  be obtained by integrating the equation Eq.  (12.143).  From  1  =  li 
to 1  =  1 0  =  R,  p ~ 0 and P  ~ 0.  P  and p increase first  from  zero at 1  =  li. 
After  reaching  a  maximum,  P  and  p  then  decrease.  At  1  =  1 0 ,  P  and  p 
decrease  to  zero,  where  we  have  the  outer  boundary.  At  the outer radius 

1 0  =  R,  U 0  =  c210 [1- e- 2A(ra)JI(2G) = M.  lvf is  the apparent mass of the 

star as  measured  by a  distant observer. 

Similar  to the  case  of the  normal solutions,  we  can  use  the  parameter 
form of the TOV equation Eq. (12.216) and (12.217) to obtain the numerical 
solutions.  We  can also  calculate the particle number in  the star by

Now  we  discuss  the  case  of  the  solutions  with  initial  value  Ui  <  0  at 
li  f.  0.  Numerical  calculations  show  that  u  increases  from  the  negative 
value to a positive value at the outer radius 1 o·  u  =  U 0  at 1  =  1 0  corresponds 
to the mass  of the  star as  measured  by  a  distant  observer.  The structure

then  decreases  to  zero  at  the  outer  radius  1 0 •  p  and  P,  as  functions  of 
~,  show  the  similar  change  tendency.  P  increases  from  0  according  to 
Eq.  (12.211b).  After reaching a maximum, P  decreases to zero at the outer

radius  ro.  Figure  12.2  show  the  particle  number  N,  mass  M  and  outer 
radius r 0  as  functions  of ui  at ri  = a.  From Fig.  12.2, we  can see that the 
particle number N  increases with the increase of lui I,  exhibiting a power law 
dependence.  The mass M  also  increases with the increase of I ui I  according 
to the power  law with a  crossover.  The crossover value corresponds to the 
minimum  in the  curve of r 0 •  The outer  radius  r 0  decreases  first  with  the 
increase of luil  to a  minimum at luiml  and then increases with the increase 
of luil·  When  luil  < luiml,  although ro  decreases with the increase of luil, 
the  peak  values  of  p  and  P  are  increased.  The  increase  of  N  and  M  is 
mainly  due  to  the  increase  of  the  peak  value  of  p.  When  luil  >  luiml, 
the  increase  of N  and  M  is  mainly  due  to  the  increase  of r 0 .  When  luil 
increases, g0  = (1- 2Gu 0 jc2ro)  decreases  and approaches to zero. 

One  can  also  solve  the  differential  equations  of  Eqs.  (12.216)  and 
(12.217)  by integrating from  the outer radius r 0 •  Then the solutions  with 
the void inside the center emerge naturally.  When we keep the outer radius 
r 0  in constant and make the parameter g0  = 1- 2Gu 0 /(c2r 0 )  decrease and 
approach to  zero,  the  particle  number  approaches to  infinite  and the void 
radius ri  approaches to zero. 

The solutions without maximum mass limit do  not depend on a special 
property  of the  equation  of  state  for  the  star  matter.  Similar  solutions 
can  also  be  obtained  for  other  equations  of state  P  =  P(p).  It  shall  be 
noted  that  the  Newtonian  gravitational theory  does  not  give  this  type  of 
solutions.  From Eq.  (12.157),  dPjdr = -pGm(r)jr2  < 0.  Thus  P  always 
decreases monotonously.  The pressure in the solution with a void is  zero at 
both inner radius ri  and outer radius r 0  of the two boundaries, which is  not 
compatible with the above Newtonian gravitational equation for pressure P. 
The solutions with void show  that the  Einstein general relativistic theory 
has  significant  difference  with  the  Newtonian  gravitational theory on  the 
equilibrium mass distribution.

A.1 Vectors

A position in the space can be described by a three dimensional vector
x.
In four-dimensional spacetime, it is a four-dimensional vector x. A
vector in a certain coordinate system can be expressed by the component
xi (i = 1, 2, 3) in a three-dimensional space or xα (α = 0, 1, 2, 3) in a
four-dimensional spacetime. α = 0 is usually used to denote the time
component. It is custom to use the Greek alphabet (α, β, γ,··· ) to denote
the components in spacetime and Latin alphabet (i, j, k,··· ) to denote the
components in space only.
We have used superscripts for the components xi of an ordinary vector,
which is often called a contravariant vector . A vector x can be expressed
in any coordinate system. We use x′i to denote the components of the
position vector in another coordinate system. Then the relation between
x′i and xi can be written as

x′i =

∂x′i
∂xj xj ,

(A.1)

where we have used the Einstein summation convention that a summation
is carried over doubly repeated indices. Eq. (A.1) is the deﬁnition of a
vector. A vector is an object whose components transform according to
Eq. (A.1). x′i is often written as xi′
with the prime attached to the super-
script rather than the main symbol, which can be used more conveniently.
Thus Eq. (A.1) is often written as

An inﬁnitesimal dxi can be expressed by a diﬀerential formula

xi′

=

∂xi′
∂xj xj.

dxi′

=

∂xi′
∂xj dxj.

Thus dxi forms an ordinary or contravariant vector.

Let us now consider ∂

∂xi . For a function f (x), we have from calculus

∂f
∂xi′ =
Thus the derivative transforms as

which shows that
∂xi′ is also a vector. It is called a covariant vector . Thus
we can deﬁne two types of vectors. A contravariant vector Aµ is deﬁned as
an object whose components transform as

Aµ′

=

∂xµ′
∂xν Aν .

(A.6)

A covariant vector Aµ(also called a one-form or covector) is deﬁned by the
transformation

Aµ′ =

∂xν
∂xµ′ Aν .

(A.7)

A.2 Higher rank tensors

A vector has one index for its components. A scalar has zero indices.
We can generalize them to the tensors with two or more indices. A con-
travariant tensor of rank two is of form Bµν which obeys the following
transformation relation

Bµ′ν′

=

∂xµ′
∂xα

∂xν′
∂xβ Bαβ.

ν is partly covariant and partly contravariant with the

A mixed tensor Bµ
transformation

Bµ′

A covariant tensor is deﬁned by

Bµ′ν′ =

∂xα
∂xµ′

∂xβ
∂xν′ Bαβ.

More generally,

Bµ′ν′···ρ′··· =

∂xµ′

The tensor product of two tensors produces a higher rank tensor. For

δ = Aα

γBβ

γ

The tensor product (also called outer product ) is often written as

C = A ⊗ B.

(A.15)

(A.16)

When we set a covariant and contravariant index equal and sum over
the index, we make a high rank tensor to a lower rank tensor. For example,

T α

γ

β

β ≡ T α

γ.

(A.17)

This process is called the contraction. The contraction over a pair of indices
reduces the rank of a tensor by two.

We deﬁne an inner product of two tensors by forming the outer product

and then contracting over a pair of indices. For example,

The inner product of two vectors A and B produces a scalar C

β ≡ Aα

A.3 Metric tensor

We deﬁne metric tensor as a tensor that realizes the mapping between
contravariant and covariant tensors. We use the relation A · B = AµBµ =
gµνAµBν for the deﬁnition of the metric tensor gµν. Thus we have

Aµ = gµνAν .

(A.21)

In this equation, the metric tensor plays the role of lowering the indices.
The mapping should be invertible. We have the deﬁnition of gµν :

Aµ = gµν Aν.

(A.22)

Thus gµν raises the indices. From the deﬁnition of metric tensor, we can see
that gµν should be symmetric if we want A · B = AµBµ = B · A = BµAµ.
Thus

Using the relation

we have

gµν = gνµ.

Aµ = gµαAα = gµαgανAν ,

gναgαµ = δµ
ν .

(A.23)

(A.24)

(A.25)

When we use the metric tensor gµν to lower the metric gµν, we have

gµ
ν = gναgαµ = δµ
ν .

(A.26)

Thus gµ

ν is also a Kronecker delta.

A.4 Flat spacetime

The simplest metric is the metric of ﬂat space. The three-dimensional
Euclidean space is characterized by the metric gij = δij . The Minkowski
metric of four-dimensional spacetime is given by gµν = ηµν or gµν = η′µν
with

ηµν =

369

η′µν has the signature [−1, 1, 1, 1]. It is just a custom to use ηµν or η′µν to
describe the Minkowski spacetime. We use ηµν in the quantum ﬁeld theory
and η′µν in other parts of the book. Since ηµν = −η′µν , one can easily
make transformation. To simplify the notation, we often omit the prime in
η′µν .

When the signature [−1, 1, 1, 1] is used, for a contravariant vector spec-

iﬁed by

Aµ = (A0, Ai) = (A0, A),

the covariant vector Aµ = ηµν Aν has the form

Aµ = (A0, Ai) = (−A0, Ai) = (−A0, A).

The distance of the spacetime is deﬁned by

(ds)2 = dxµdxµ = gµνdxµdxν .

In the Minkowski metric

(ds)2 = −(dt)2 + (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2

(A.28)

(A.29)

(A.30)

(A.31)

when the signature [−1, 1, 1, 1] is used. The proper time dτ is deﬁned by
(A.32)

(dτ )2 = −(ds)2 = (dt)2 − (dx)2 − (dy)2 − (dz)2.

Thus the signature [1,−1,−1,−1] describes the proper time. In the unit
c 6= 1, we have

(cdτ )2 = −(ds)2 = c2(dt)2 − (dx)2 − (dy)2 − (dz)2.

(A.33)

The proper time is the time measured in the local rest frame of observer.
In terms of proper time, we can introduce an useful vector, the four-velocity
uµ, which is deﬁned by

uµ ≡

dxµ
dτ

0 =

ν is the 4 × 4 matrix for an unit rotation around the axis in
the n direction. ∆ω is the inﬁnitesimal rotation angle around the n axis.

axis is perpendicular to the x0 and x1 axes. We use n(01) to denote the n
axis. According to Eq. (A.40),

A.6 Christoﬀel symbols

Now we consider a contravariant vector ﬁeld Aµ(xµ) as a function of con-
travariant coordinates. The direct derivative ∂Aµ

∂xν is often denoted as

Aµ

,ν ≡

∂Aµ
∂xν .

(A.60)

However, there is a problem here that the derivative Aµ

,ν is not a tensor.

This can be seen from the transformation of Aµ

Since Aα is a function of xµ, we need express ∂Aα

of the derivative

(A.63)

A vector has a direction. The direction also changes with the location in
a curved spacetime. Therefore, the diﬀerence between two vectors is not a
simple diﬀerence of components if they are located at diﬀerent positions.
In order to compare the direction of a vector, we need ﬁrst put them at the
same point in spacetime. This procedure is called the parallel transport.

We denote δAµ as the change produced in the vector Aµ(xν ) at xν by

an inﬁnitesimal parallel transport of distance dxν

δAµ should also be directly proportional to Aµ because larger Aµ would
produces larger change. Thus

δAµ ∝ dxν .

(A.64)

δAµ = −Γµ

where Γµ
αν is the constant of proportionality and is called the Christoﬀel
symbol or Levi-Civita connection. It deﬁnes the parallel transport of a vec-
tor. The vector Aµ(xν ) at xν parallel transported an inﬁnitesimal distance
dxν to the position at xν + dxν has the components

Cµ = Aµ + δAµ.

(A.66)

The vector Aµ(xν ) at xν + dxν has the components Aµ(xν + dxν ). The

diﬀerence between them gives

dAµ = Aµ(xν + dxν ) − [Aµ(xν ) + δAµ].

(A.67)

This is the diﬀerence between two vector located at the same point, which
should be also a vector. Thus we have a deﬁnition of derivative for a vector

Aµ(xν + δxν) − [Aµ(xν ) + δAµ]

Now we consider the derivative of a covariant vector Bµ. For any con-

A physical curved spacetime should have a local Minkowski metric to
guarantee the local causality. In this local Minkowski metric, Γµ
αβ is zero
and thus Γµ
[αβ] is a tensor. If the tensor
Γµ
[αβ] vanishes in one coordinate system, it must vanish in any coordinate
system. Now let us prove that Γµ

[αβ] is zero. We can prove that Γµ

A.7 Riemann spacetime

Mathematically, at any position P , we can ﬁnd a local ﬂat space ‘tangent’
to any curved space if we do not restrict the transformation. Physically the
local metric should be a local Minkowski metric to fulﬁll the causality. We

378

Principles of Physics

call the spacetime with this property as the Riemann spacetime or strictly
pseudo-Riemann spacetime (The metric of the Riemann space is positive-
deﬁnite by deﬁnition).
In this local ﬂat spacetime at P , straight line is
meaningful locally. Thus Γα
[µν] is zero at P locally at this local Minkowski
metric. In these coordinates at this point P , the covariant derivative of a
vector Aα is given by the ordinary derivative of the vector.

Aα

;β = Aα

at P in local ﬂat spacetime.

(A.81)

In this local ﬂat metric, the metric is constant locally. We have

gµν;λ = gµν,λ = 0

at P.

(A.82)

gµν is a tensor. If the equation gµν;λ = 0 is true in one frame, it will be
valid in any frame. Therefore, we have

gµν;λ = 0.

Since Γτ

[µν] = 0 for a Riemann spacetime, we have

(A.83)

(A.84)

The connection should be symmetric.

Eqs. (A.83) and (A.84) can lead to an important formula in which the
Christoﬀel symbol is expressed in terms of the metric tensor and its deriva-
tives. From Eq. (A.83), we have

gµν;λ = gµν,λ − Γα

µλgαν − Γα

νλgµα = 0.

This gives

gµν,λ = Γα

We use g to denote the determinant |gαβ| and calculate the diﬀerential
dg of the determinant g. dg can be evaluated by taking the diﬀerential of
each component of the tensor gαβ and multiplying it by its coeﬃcient in
the determinant which is the corresponding minor. Since the tensor gαβ
is reciprocal to gαβ, the components of gαβ are equal to the minors of the
determinant of gαβ divided by the determinant. Thus, we have

dg = ggαβdgαβ = −ggαβdgαβ.

where T denotes transpose. Evaluating the determinant of Eq. (A.98), we

Grassmann Algebra

The fermion ﬁeld operators obey the anti-commutation relations. Corres-
pondingly, the fermion ﬁeld functions can not be simply described by the
ordinary number. The anti-commuting numbers have to be introduced.
Since the anti-commuting numbers were ﬁrst introduced by Hermann Grass-
mann, we call these numbers Grassmann variables.

A Grassmann algebra (also called exterior algebra) is an algebra con-
structed from a set of generators θi obeying the anti-commutiion relation

The index i of θi runs from 1 to n. n is called the dimension of the algebra.
Later we will generalize θi to θ(x) for an inﬁnite dimension.

{θi, θj} = 0.

(D.1)

From Eq. (D.1), we have

θ2
i = 0.

(D.2)

Thus the square and all higher powers of a generator vanish. When we
expand an element of the Grassmann algebra, we have only ﬁnite sum of
the following terms due to Eq. (D.2).

i1,i2 θi1 θi2 + ··· + f (n)θi1 θi2 ··· θin ,

(D.3)

f (θi) = f (0) +Xi

f (1)

i θi + Xi1<i2

where the coeﬃcients f (i) are ordinary numbers. We deﬁne diﬀerentiation
with respect to the generators by

(D.4)

and

d

The minus sign comes from the anti-commutation relation when the factor

applied directly. From Eq. (D.4), we have

All the higher derivatives with respect to the same generator θi are zero.
The integration of the generators of Grassmann algebra is deﬁned by

Z dθi = 0,
Z dθiθi = 1.

(D.7a)

(D.7b)

The deﬁnition Eq. (D.7) is made to guarantee the translation invariance of
the integration, which is an important property of the ordinary integration.
For any function f (θ), its expanded form is

f = f1 + f2θ.

(D.8)

Then

Z dθf (θ + η) = Z dθ[f1 + f2(θ + η)]

= Z dθ(f1 + f2θ) +Z dθf2η
= Z dθf (θ).

(D.9)

Comparing the deﬁnitions of

the diﬀerentiation and integration
(Eqs. (D.4) and (D.7)), we can see that the operators of diﬀerentiation and
integration for Grassmann variables are the same. Thus the diﬀerentials
dθi obey the same anti-commutation relations as d
dθi

.

{dθi, dθj} = 0,
{dθi, θj} = δij.

(D.10a)

(D.10b)

Now let us consider the variable transformations in the integral involving
Grassmann algebra. For a linear transformation in one-dimension such as

θ′ = η + aθ,

= Z dθ′f (θ)
= Z dθ′(cid:18) dθ

It should be noted that Eq. (D.12) is diﬀerent with the transformation
formula for ordinary integration

Z dxf (x) =Z dx′ dx

(D.13)

The Grassmann integral exhibits the opposite behavior as compared to
the ordinary integral. In general, under a linear transformation for an n-
dimensional Grassmann algebra

aijθj + ηi,

(D.14)

Z dθn ··· θ1f (θ) =Z dθ′n ··· θ′1(cid:20)det(cid:18) dθ

dθ′(cid:19)(cid:21)−1

f (θ).

(D.15)

We have a factor of the inverse of the Jacobian determinant instead of the
Jacobian determinant.

Now let us evaluate the Gaussian integrals for Grassmann algebra. Since
the Dirac fermion ﬁeld is complex, we introduce the complex Grassmann
variables. θi and θ∗i obeying the anti-commutation relations

{θi, θj} = {θ∗i , θ∗j} = {θi, θ∗j} = 0.

The conjugate generators are deﬁned as

(θi)∗ = θ∗i ,
(θ∗i )∗ = θi,
(θi1 θi2 ··· θin )∗ = θ∗in ··· θ∗i2 θ∗i1 ,

The ﬂat physical spacetime is the Minkowski spacetime. The Wick rotation
makes the calculations easier because we can transform the calculations

four-dimensional Euclidean space is obtained from the Minkowski spacetime
by the transformation.

σiσj = iǫijkσk + δij,

σiσj − σj σi = 2iǫijkσk,

Jacobian

We consider functions of two variables: u(x, y) and v(x, y). The Jacobian
determinant is deﬁned by

∂(u, v)

∂(x, y) ≡(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(G.1)

There are several relations for Jacobian which are useful in the calcula-
tions of the thermodynamic derivatives. When f = f (u, v) and g = g(u, v)
are two functions of u and v, we can prove the following chain rule

∂(f, g)
∂(x, y)

=

∂(f, g)∂(u, v)
∂(u, v)∂(x, y)

.

Interchanging two columns of the determinant, we have

Setting v = y, Eq. (G.1) becomes

Geodesic Equation

In the Euclidean space or Minkowski spacetime, a line without changing
its direction is a straight line. The shortest line in the Euclidean space or
Minkowski spacetime is a straight line. Thus we call them the ﬂat space
or ﬂat spacetime. In the curved spacetime such as the Riemann spacetime,
there is no more a straight line. However, one can extend the concept of
straight line to the curved space. A straight line in the Euclidean space is
a line without changing the direction characterized by the tangent of the
line. Similarly we deﬁne the ′straight line′ or precisely so-called geodesics
in the Riemann spacetime a line in which the tangents of nearby points are
parallel. We denote uµ = dxµ
dλ as the tangent of the curve x(λ) with λ as
the curve parameter. Then a geodesic is a line determined by the following
equation

In the component notation, we have

∇uu = 0.

Inserting uµ = dxµ

(H.3)

Eq. (H.3) is called the geodesic equation. It describes a line drawn in such
a way that keeps its tangent as parallel as possible.

A geodesic is also a curve with minimal distance between any two
points. The shortest line in the Euclidean space or Minkowski spacetime
is a straight line. In the curved spacetime such as the Riemann spacetime,
we will prove that the shortest line is a geodesic line. We can use the varia-
tion principle to derive the equation that describes the shortest line in the
