Or have you come to a mere dictatorship, which some persons in the nineteenth century used to prophesy as the ultimate outcome of democracy? Indeed, this last question does not seem so very unreasonable, since you have turned your Parliament House into a dung-market. Or where do you house your present Parliament?”    Th e old man answered my smile with a hearty laugh, and said: “Well, well, dung is not the worst kind of corruption; fertility may come of that, whereas mere dearth came from the other kind, of which those wells once held the great supporters. Now, dear guest, let me tell you that our present parliament would be hard to house in one place, because the whole people is our parliament.   William Morris, “News From Nowhere” (1890)      Epig raph     vii Th e interconnection between economic development, agricultural produc-tion, and environmental change poses one of the most challenging ques-tions in the world today. How can we provide enough food and properly nourish an increasingly urbanised global population, while promoting fair and sustainable development in rural and urban areas, particularly in the Global South? Th e answers to those problems are not trivial, but require critical and creative thinking and a move away from pre-established solu-tions and most of the strategies adopted during the last century. Th e chal-lenge is, fi rst and foremost, political, as it necessarily involves choices, decisions, and the redistribution of resources and opportunities. Th e debate on the role and the prospects of agriculture is critical, not only because of fi erce disputes over land ownership, resource use, and commodity chains, but also, even more importantly, because it reveals a great deal about wider socio-economic trends and the socio- ecological safety of nations, cities, and regions. For instance, one current major controversy involves the associa-tion between mainstream food production and growing malnutrition and health problems, as well as deforestation, nature grabbing, and community impacts. Th e intensifi cation of food production and commercialisation is also associated with mounting levels of obesity, bad health, environmental disruption, and food insecurity.  Unfortunately, most government reactions to those problems seem to reproduce an outdated, productivist way of thinking about development and   Pref ace   viii Prefacethe environment. Public policies are largely limited by the powerful infl uence of global corporations, mega-supermarkets, and, increasingly, investment funds. On the other hand, it is promising that increasing numbers of authors are expressing an interest in the interdependencies between agriculture, envi-ronmental change, and development goals. In the UK, the academic com-munity has dedicated growing attention to the socio-ecological complexity of food production systems, an idea which has received substantial support from the research councils. However, it is less common to fi nd academics and policymakers addressing the “political nexus” between environmental change, nature-as-resource, and the contradictions of agricultural capitalism. Conventional approaches to problem- solving remain superfi cial in terms of connecting the politico-economic basis of agribusiness, rapid environmen-tal change, and the joint exploitation of people and nature. Th is failure to consider the centrality of political dilemmas reveals a great deal about the shortcomings of Western science and the prevailing mechanisms of policy-making. It also highlights the alienation of consumers, scholars, and food producers, and how diffi  cult it is to fi nd viable alternatives. Th erefore, the study of the food–environment–energy nexus—as well as other interconnec-tions that are increasingly being described as “nexus” by British scholars—needs to embrace the totality of relations between sectors, themes, scales, and historical periods. It will never be possible to overcome food insuffi  ciencies and rural poverty without confronting the hegemonic forces that persistently undervalue the socionatural whole and accumulate capital from the deliber-ate fragmentation of socionature.  As a contribution to fi lling this gap in the specialised literature, this book contains conceptual and empirical chapters that explore the inter-dependencies between food, development, and the environment from multiple perspectives and in multiple settings, examining both past legacies and emerging trends. Th e book is the outcome of a productive dialogue between British and Brazilian academics who took part in the workshop “Water as the Frontier of Agribusiness: Politico-Ecological and Socio-Economic Connections from Farms to Global Markets”. Th e event was coordinated and chaired by José Gilberto de Souza and Antonio A.R. Ioris, and took place in March 2015 in central São Paulo, at the headquarters of the Institute of Public Policy and International Relations (IPPRI), a department of the State University of São Paulo (UNESP). It  Preface ixwas funded by the UK-Newton Fund (via the British Council), the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), and the UNESP, whose support is warmly acknowledged and greatly appreciated.  Overall, the various workshop activities focused on the multiple syner-gies between responses to food insecurity and environmental management controversies, which require profound and meaningful transformations under the hegemonic direction of rural development and wider socio- economic activities. Th e friendly and constructive interaction during the event led to the idea of publishing a book—immediately accepted and encouraged by the British Council—featuring the work of those partici-pants who wanted to share their refl ections and research fi ndings. Among many other things, the authors of this book agree that important lessons can be learned from the trajectory of farmers and their associations in both Northern and Southern countries. Likewise, the trajectory of agri-culture, rural development, and environmental management is an inte-gral element of the broader search for justice and sustainability, which necessarily require novel forms of understanding common problems and the critical basis of socio-ecological transformation.  Th e book’s content and the sequence of chapters have been chosen pri-marily to provide a balance between theory and empirical results, with a focus on three main world regions: Europe, India, and Brazil. Th e aim is not to be comprehensive or to cover all the main aspects of the academic debate (which would, in any case, be impossible in a single book), but to provide an overview of some important questions and give a fl avour of the critical research being conducted in the UK and in Brazil. In the introduction, Ioris discusses the evolution of agriculture and agribusi-ness in the context of social and economic neoliberalisation, as well as considering economic thinking about the environment and, in particu-lar, water. Chapter   2    , by Fish and colleagues, considers the UK context as it investigates the importance of water management for agriculture and the role of integrative approaches and collaborative governance. In Chap.   3    , Moragues-Faus examines Mediterranean agri-food systems and lessons from European food studies and politico-ecological perspectives. Chapter   4    , by Bharucha, presents a study of water scarcity and agricul-ture practised in dryland areas of India, bringing together evidence from diff erent interest groups and their search for alternatives. In Chap.   5    , x PrefaceSobreiro Filho and collaborators take into account the social and political production of territories and make use of a case study from the Brazilian northeast region to discuss agrarian, labour, and environmental prob-lems. In Chap.   6    , Feliciano analyses extensive data on the environmental impacts of fruit production in Brazil and the insertion of the sector into global trade markets. Peres and Souza discuss in Chap.   7     the epistemol-ogy of water resources and off er a critique of virtual water based on a recalculation of the water balance. Empinotti, in Chap.   8    , explores the introduction of a new water regulation framework in Brazil, which has many parallels with the European and international experience. Finally, in Chap.   9    , Ioris returns to some of the points mentioned in the introduc-tion and, considering the contribution of the other authors, scrutinises the current trends of agriculture and agribusiness in Brazil, with a focus on the country’s main agricultural frontier area in the State of Mato Grosso.  Th e literature on those topics is vast, and rapidly growing, but we sin-cerely believe that this book off ers a critical and original perspective on the politicised interface between agriculture, development, and natural resources. If nothing else, most of the material included in these chapters is presented here for the fi rst time and, particularly in relation to the Brazilian context, will facilitate access by international readers to themes not yet adequately dealt with in published literature and still largely ignored by foreign academics. In our work, we reaffi  rm the importance and the contested basis of rural development, agricultural modernisation, and the transformation of nature into economic resources, which will continue to attract attention from diff erent sectors and will require sub-stantive improvements in public policy. Th ese issues certainly deserve to be discussed further in universities, policymaking circles, and all sectors of civil society, and we hope to remain engaged in those debates, asking questions and learning from those aff ected and involved in the processes of agricultural and environmental change.

R.     Ioris             Contemporary Agribusiness as the Rural Expression of Neoliberalism  Th e diff erent chapters of this book discuss key aspects of agricultural modernization and raise some important questions about politico-eco-nomic and socio-ecological transformations taking place in countries of both the Global North (Europe in particular) and the Global South (with specifi c examples from Brazil and India). Our starting point is that, because of complex socio-economic interactions, environmental pres-sures, and fi erce disputes, agriculture and rural development are today among the most controversial areas of policymaking, planning, and lob-bying. With the encroachment of contemporary capitalism upon food production and biological systems, agriculture has become increasingly associated with, and subordinate to, a globalized agroindustrial complex         A.  A.  R.   Ioris      ((cid:13))   University of Edinburgh ,   Edinburgh ,  UK     that exerts decisive infl uence over technology, fi nancing, logistics, and  commercialization. In general terms, a—partial and problematic—transi-tion from agriculture to agribusiness has taken place over the last century, with the last two decades or so seeing a further transition to neoliberal-ized agribusiness. Consequently, the concept of agribusiness, which was originally introduced in the 1950s at the time of Fordist agriculture in the USA, has had to mutate in order to encapsulate agricultural produc-tion based on business-friendly state interventions, policy liberalization, and the dominance of transnational corporations.  It is not diffi  cult to empirically verify that most agricultural activities today are shaped by the impact of neoliberal capitalism on production areas and on the processing and distribution of agri-food goods and the management of related services (Heasman and Lang  2004 ). Examples include a number of techno-economic innovations introduced by neolib-eralized agribusiness sectors, for example, genetically modifi ed organisms (GMOs), digital farming technologies, and satellite-guided machinery, as well as new production dynamics such as land and gene grabs, the priva-tization of common land, pervasive fi nancialization, the decisive role of global corporations, and the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995. Th ese combine old and new strategies to renovate capitalism and minimize socio-ecological obstacles to economic growth. Th e results are intriguing, and suggest that further studies are necessary to understand the interplay between agriculture, food insecurity, and socionatural changes. On the one hand, agriculture as neoliberal agribusiness has achieved con-siderable results during the last three decades, in terms of additional areas under cultivation, intensifi cation of production, and complex market integration. Th e aim of neoliberalized agriculture is to maximize produc-tion and profi tability and suppress income gains for the labouring classes in a way that has reconstructed agriculture as a ‘world farm’ (McMichael  2010 ). On the other hand, however, these are also activities characterized by contradictions, failures, and limitations at local, national, and global scales. Never before has so much food been produced and so much space been used by farmers, but at the same time, record amounts of food are wasted every day, and a signifi cant proportion of the global population struggles to maintain minimum levels of nutrition, while a comparable percentage suff ers from the consequences of obesity (Patel  2008 ). 2 A.A.R. Ioris Taking into account these challenging circumstances, the main  rationale for this book is that the staggering complexity of food and agriculture in the early decades of the new century can sometimes go unnoticed in a world dominated by many other urgent concerns and, more importantly, due to the false sense of security off ered by intensive technologies and extensive global trade. Particularly in the North, and among high- income groups in the Global South, food is easily aff ordable and even taken for granted, despite the fact that food supply depends on a highly vulnerable distribution network controlled by a small number of transnational companies and supermarket chains. Th e following chapters will explore and discuss how the many asymmetries and uncertainties in the agri-food sector are directly and indirectly related to the instabilities of the contemporary economy, characterized by global speculation, struc-tural inequalities, renewed forms of exploitation, and wasteful patterns of production and consumption. Ultimately, the consolidation of a global society centred on market principles has increasingly undermined indi-vidual and collective rights, and, even more importantly, subdued other socio-ecological demands. First of all, we will examine in more detail the signifi cance and repercussions of neoliberalized agribusiness.      Studying the Transition to Neoliberal Agribusiness  Agrarian and food studies have certainly travelled a long way in the last hundred years, from a focus on rural communities around the turn of the twentieth century, via the dominance of functionalist theory and the exaltation of technological innovation in the post-war years and, even-tually, to the neo-Marxism and other critical approaches introduced in the 1970s (Buttel et al.  1990 ). Since then, critical authors have started to question traditional scholarship—typically anchored in the sup-posed  stability, desirability, and constant progress of capitalist society in America and beyond—with new interpretations of the rural economy, reasons for the unexpected survival of the peasantry, and the growing commodifi cation of labour and nature. With the collapse of the Berlin Wall and consequent sociopolitical adjustments associated with a less 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 3polarized world order, the focus of agrarian and rural studies shifted from location, context, and diversity to a range of approaches informed by behavioural research, actor–network theories, food regimes, and regula-tion theory (Robinson  2004 ). More than just a technical-economic issue, this reconfi guration of agriculture in recent decades has been described as a sociopolitical project that has come about through the struggle between social classes and diff erent fractions of capital. An especially important part of the discussion has focused on the transition from a Fordist agri-culture (focused on mass production, standardization, and higher lev-els of effi  ciency) into an alleged post-productivist and multifunctional arrangement that followed the introduction of post-Keynesian policies and the search for additional goals beyond food production (Ilbey and Bowler  1998 ). See more on this debate in Chap.   3    .  However, post-productivist and multifunctional tendencies repre-sent only part of the neoliberalizing pressures that have reshaped con-temporary agribusiness and subjected it to the imperatives of fl exible accumulation, market globalization, and the systematic concealment of class-based tensions. Th e intricacies of global agri-food activities today are at once product and co-producer of the dominant modernization of capitalism in accordance with the discourse and the strategies of neo-liberalism. Neoliberalism is not only an economic and social phenom-enon, it also constitutes an assertive programme aimed at dislodging the politico-economic approaches adopted before the 1980s (Connell and Dados  2014 ). It has meant an evolution from the post-war regime, which was defi ned by the fl ows of (surplus) food from the USA to its infor-mal empire of post-colonial states (according to the strategic perimeters of the Cold War), towards agri-food liberalization via structural adjust-ments, lower national trade barriers, the dismantling of farm sector pro-tections, and new intellectual property relations (McMichael  2012 ). In practice, neoliberal strategies have tried both to win new markets and to placate political resistance through a discourse of multiple activities,  environmental responsibility, and supposed food security (Dibden et al.  2009 ). Neoliberalized agribusiness has also evolved through an incoher-ent argument about the virtues of free market transactions, while there are simultaneous calls for sustained state interventions to regulate price oscillations and eliminate overproduction. 4 A.A.R. Ioris Th e complexity of the neoliberal agri-food regime is particularly  evident in relation to the uneven geographical development of the capi-talist economy, and therefore needs to be understood in the wider con-text of the world ecology of capitalism (Moore  2015 ). Th e geography of neoliberalized agribusiness is characterized by a plurality of production and consumption activities, extending and connecting locales, regions, and nations. It has involved, in particular, the enforcement of free trade and other supranational agreements and the prioritization of the biotech-nological production package (Pechlaner and Otero  2008 ). In practical terms, it is undeniable that neoliberalized agribusiness is less concerned with rural development strategies (as promoted by state agencies during most of the twentieth century) and more focused on a range of pro-cesses (rather than one isolated phenomenon with clear-cut boundaries) required for the maximization of profi t and rapid capital accumulation from agri-food operations. Th e neoliberalization of food and agriculture has been a deliberate attempt to fi x the systemic crisis of the Fordist agri- food regime without preventing the re-emergence of instability, protest, socio-ecological degradation, and, ultimately, a defi cit of legitimacy (Wolf and Bonanno  2014 ).  It is crucial to observe that contemporary rural development and the agri-food sector have revealed, and largely depended on, the hegemony of transnational corporations, the integration of domestic production into global trade, and a number of free trade agreements. In more gen-eral terms, rural development now happens through both vertical (from rural spaces to the agri-food sector) and horizontal (rural spaces linked to other non-agricultural sectors) networks (Murdoch  2000 ). Yet, because of its bioeconomic properties, agricultural production cannot be inte-grated in the same way as the industrial sector (Goodman and Watts  1997 ), which means that local sociocultural factors and socio-ecological conditions remain signifi cant despite the globalization of agribusiness. Likewise, the internationalization and networking of agri-food under the hegemonic infl uence of transnational corporations has not happened without resistance and reactions. Protests grow through diff erent scales and have resulted in a variety of political, symbolic, and material con-sequences (Stock et al.  2014 ), although these have often been unrefl ex-ive and superfi cial (Harris  2009 ). Th e socio-ecological contradictions of 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 5 neoliberalized agribusiness are particularly noticeable in the case of con-temporary Brazil and its burgeoning agribusiness-based economy. Due to sustained promotion campaigns and the emphasis placed on it by public policymaking, the term ‘agribusiness’ has a particular meaning in Brazil and is more widely used in common public debates than in other regions of the world. Th e national experience is briefl y analysed in the next sec-tion, making use of a simple analytical approach, which paves the way for the subsequent chapters.      A Proposed Analytical Framework and the Unpalatable Neoliberalization of Brazilian Agribusiness  Brazil is increasingly perceived as a world agricultural powerhouse which, in principle, could have a lot to off er in terms of preventing a looming, increasingly global, food crisis. Particularly with the slowdown of Brazil’s national economy since 2010 (and especially after the controversial presidential election of 2014), agribusiness is an island of prosperity and dynamism in a context of corporate losses and lack of investment. As a consequence, Brazil has been a strong advocate of free market globaliza-tion and has pushed for calculated liberalization of the global agri- food trade (Hopewell  2013 ). However, as in other parts of the world, neolib-eralized agribusiness in Brazil has been severely criticized over its actual benefi ciaries and ambiguous prospects. Th e sector seems to thrive on a peculiar combination of tradition and modernity, which is clearly present in the attitudes and ambivalent discourse of large landowners and allied politicians. Neoliberalized agribusiness has many new features when com-pared with the previous, nationalistic period of agricultural moderniza-tion in the 1960s and 1970s, but it also betrays the strong elements of social exclusion, authoritarianism, and deception that have long governed economic development in the country. Th e rapid advance of agribusi-ness towards the central and northern states of Brazil in particular has been associated with severe environmental, cultural, and socio-economic impacts, including deforestation, violence against rural workers and indig-enous populations, and notable cases of state capture and corruption. 6 A.A.R. Ioris All this betrays an intrinsic opportunism and demonstrates the pecu-liar nature of market-friendly rationalities, shaped by the demands of transnational corporations, national politicians, and rural elites (Ioris  2015 ). Governments and national business associations try to depict the advance of agribusiness in Brazil as the embodiment of the most progres-sive elements of an emerging economy that is part of the select group of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries. Nonetheless, neolib-eral agribusiness essentially constitutes a late, already obsolete type of modernity that replicates many mistakes from elsewhere in the country and other parts of the world. If neoliberalized agribusiness has eff ectively become one of the pillars of the Brazilian economy, it has also had trou-bling consequences as the country has faced progressive deindustrializa-tion and become increasingly reliant on foreign investments and imports of intermediate inputs and capital goods. All these discursive and mate-rial developments are still to be studied in depth by critical scholars, particularly in terms of connecting the specifi c situations of diff erent localities and regions with broader macroeconomic trends. Challenging the rhetoric of progress and creativity, a more critical examination would question the actual contribution of agribusiness to local and regional economies and the national economy. A deeper interpretation should be able to examine the idiosyncratic, apparently paradoxical combination of small innovations and transgressions that characterizes these capital-ist relations of production and reproduction. Although the sector makes use of the appealing symbolism of triumph and modernization, the evo-lution of agribusiness has actually served to unify the interests of rural conservative groups and reinforce processes of political hegemony and class domination.  Th e expansion of neoliberal agribusiness, viewed in the wider context of the politico-ecological economy of contemporary capitalism, is examined here with the assistance of an original analytical framework structured around three explanatory categories: displacement (sectoral and spatial transforma-tions), fi nancialization (the prioritization of fi nancial gain over agricultural outcomes), and mystifi cation (dissimulation of neoliberalizing trends and associated risks and disputes). Th is proposed analytical framework has signif-icant implications for academic research and policymaking, especially within politico-economy and neoliberalism studies, to the extent that it encapsulates 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 7interdependent processes that are together responsible for the revitalization of agribusiness and for the legitimization of global agri-food markets. Th e framework is then used to highlight the historico-geographical repercussions of neoliberalized agribusiness in Brazil, which has been a feature of conser-vative responses to the crisis of accumulation caused by the exhaustion of developmentalist policies and state-led entrepreneurialism.     Displacement  Displacement is the fi rst main dimension of neoliberalized agribusi-ness to consider. Th e neoliberal model has seen the previous emphasis on rural development, job creation, and infrastructure replaced with a focus on market integration, cost reduction, effi  ciency gains, and tech-nological intensifi cation. Th e political strength of neoliberal agribusiness actually comes from the consolidation of new economic strategies that supplanted the developmentalist policies that were hegemonic before the 1980s. Displacement has sectoral and spatial manifestations. It occurs, for instance, due to technological developments (e.g. constant release of new agrochemicals, genetically modifi ed seeds, and sophisticated machin-ery and digital equipment), inter-country trade (often at the expense of national and local food demand), and the facilitated interchangeability of diff erent forms of capital in commodity and land markets. Th e affi  rmation of the neoliberal agri-food regime is also associated with the migration of farmers and companies to new areas and the incorporation of regions that were not previously involved in production or were beyond the reach of global markets. Although local food production still represents a sig-nifi cant segment of the market (particularly production  involving family farmers and peasant communities), southern countries have been encour-aged to expand the export of high-value foods (e.g. expensive soft fruits, out-of-season vegetables, luxury crops, etc.) to northern markets, as well as to cultivate biofuel crops under the infl uence, for example, of northern environmental agendas.  Displacement is particularly demonstrated by the fact that agriculture continues to be practised in the localized context of farms and regions, while management, technological developments, and trade relations 8 A.A.R. Iorisincreasingly involve transnational interactions and priorities. Th e dis-placement associated with agribusiness is, thus, dialectically related to the transnationalization of the rural economy, in the sense that activities and processes are (partially) altered at local or horizontal level, only to be then (partially and problematically) integrated into globalized phenom-ena. Rural areas are therefore ‘reproduced, and the social relations therein recomposed, by virtue of their contemporary magnetism for relocation due to the wider discontinuities of capital activity’ (Cloke et al.  1990 : 15). Th e search for effi  ciency and the emphasis on competitive advantages result in the dispossession of less successful smallholders by commercial smallholders and large estates that are vertically integrated into agribusi-ness marketing chains (Amanor  2012 ). At the same time, the removal of public subsidies and the dismantling of state-owned enterprises have signifi cantly aff ected rural populations and increased their level of vul-nerability, often prompting domestic and international migration as a negotiated response to the emerging problems (Torres and Carte  2014 ).  In the case of Brazil, large areas have been transformed by the advance of neoliberal agribusiness due to the intensifi cation, and joint opera-tion, of public and private capital investments. Th e country has been a supplier of foodstuff s since early colonial times, and this only increased with the conservative modernization of agriculture promoted during the dictatorship imposed by the military and conservative political elites (1964–1985). Agricultural modernization implemented by the generals happened through the aggressive expansion of credit, the integration of farming with industry, and dedicated rural development policies. Priority was then given to the Fordist expansion of production through the adop-tion of new technologies, fi scal incentives, and subsidized loans. Th e political motivation was the need to weaken the political debate about agrarian reforms and replace it with a technocratic emphasis on food production and regional development. Th is conservative modernization of Brazilian agriculture was based on the integration of diff erent forms of capital into large agroindustrial chains. After achieving remarkable rates of growth in the 1960s and 1970s, the state-centralized model started to show its serious limitations when faced with the debt crisis, escalat-ing rates of infl ation and macroeconomic instability. Consequently, the Brazilian agricultural sector suff ered a period of turbulence and 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 9uncertainty from the mid-1980s onwards, aggravated by higher interest rates, a reduction in support schemes (e.g. guaranteed prices), decreased availability of bank loans, and falling land prices.  With the introduction of liberalizing reforms in 1990, conditions were again favourable for the recovery of agribusiness as a dynamic economic sector. Th e neoliberalization of agribusiness benefi ted from, and contrib-uted to, a wider process of sectoral displacement due to an emphasis on imports of intermediate inputs and capital goods (to contain infl ation and appease consumer demand) and ill-conceived deindustrialization policies. In addition, spatial displacement occurred through the migra-tion of production to other regions and the concentration of activity in large estates with thousands, or in some cases tens of thousands, of hect-ares. Th e most emblematic experience was the conversion of millions of hectares of savannahs ( cerrado ) in the central region of the country (con-sidered as ‘spare farmland’) into soybean plantations and cattle ranches in close coordination with ever-bigger agroindustries (Barretto et al.  2013 ). Such neoliberal ‘land reform’ (in eff ect, an anti-agrarian reform similar to the one adopted by the military governments) was based on the sac-rosanct ownership of private land in the name of democratizing capital-ism and, more importantly, reducing the excesses of the state. Sizeable commercial partnerships have been established between Brazil and other southern countries, China in particular, which have, to a degree, replaced the established North–South fl ow of agricultural goods (e.g. the export of soybean from Brazil to the European Union was particularly relevant dur-ing previous decades). Overall, neoliberalized agribusiness has not only reinforced previous developmentalist policies, but also worked through a combination of physical, social, and political shifts that has displaced, but in some cases also reaffi  rmed, old tendencies of agrarian capitalism and transformed Brazil into the fi rst tropical food giant on the planet.      Financialization  Th e second main feature of neoliberalized agribusiness is the promi-nence of fi nancialization as a decisive force behind politico-ecological changes. Financialization is a process whereby transnational corporations, 10 A.A.R. Ioris commercial elites, and fi nancial institutions acquire ever-greater infl u-ence over rural policymaking and agricultural outcomes at the expense of the more traditional players of the previous developmentalist phase. Since the crisis of Keynesian policies (typically based on direct state entre-preneurship), agribusiness has operated through a gradual shift from the production side to the retail side and towards new mechanisms of capital circulation and accumulation. As a result, the entrenched fi nancialization of food and farming ends up penetrating everyday life and pervading the local, regional, and global scales of interaction. Th is leads to adjustments not only in the productive and commercial sectors (including the role of asset management companies, private equity consortia, and other fi nan-cial institutions in acquiring and managing farmland), but also along the whole agri-food supply chain, at both macro and micro levels (Burch and Lawrence  2013 ). In historico-geographical terms, the fi nancialization of the agri-food sector has provided a solution to the combination of the production and plunder spheres of capitalism. Financialization is also organically associated with spatial displacement, especially considering that neoliberalized agriculture is, above all, about the redistribution of value from the under-reproduced global periphery to the overconsuming Western core (Araghi  2009 ).  Sharing the turbulent experience of most other Latin American coun-tries, the Brazilian national state initiated a programme of neoliberal reforms in 1990 centred on monetary stabilization, privatization, and budget controls (Ioris and Ioris  2013 ). A well-crafted macroeconomic programme of infl ation targeting, introduced in 1994, strengthened the national currency but had the negative eff ect of facilitating the impor-tation of foreign goods and reducing the competitiveness of Brazilian agriculture. Trade imbalances, together with high interest rates, produced a circumstantial reduction in agricultural profi tability, but were then con-sidered necessary to reorganize the national economy. With signifi cant currency devaluation in 1999 (increased in subsequent years), favourable commodity prices, and a surge in demand, Brazil was ready to return to international markets and transform its agribusiness into a highly trans-nationalized sector gradually becoming more dominated by large (foreign and national) capital-intensive fi rms. Th e ‘end’ of cheap food (demon-strated by the 2008 ‘food crisis’ and a commodity boom between 2003 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 11and 2011) further discouraged productive investment in industry and infrastructure in favour of speculative activities that produced a massive fl ow of capital into agriculture (Moore  2015 ).  Th e fi nancialization of agribusiness and the related dependence of the Brazilian economy on the agri-food sector have continued to steadily augment over the last few years. Interestingly, in recent years, the agri-business sector has grown less than the national economy as a whole, and its participation in the national economy actually decreased between 2007 and 2013, but its contribution to the national surplus (in dollar terms) has proved vital (Barros et al.  2014 ). In 2013, the trade balance result was the worst since 2000 (a reduction of 86 % in the surplus due to weakening exports of minerals and industrialized goods) with agribusiness consolidating its role as the main money-making sector of the economy. In addition, a range of novel fi nancial instruments, such as self-fi nancing, private banks, input supplier companies, and trading companies fi lled the gap created by the reduction in the federal govern-ment’s conventional schemes. Th is is exemplifi ed, for example, by the 2004 legislation that created the Certifi cates of Agribusiness Receivables (CRAs), a registered credit instrument in which a promise of future pay-ment is linked to a debt claim.      Mystifi cation  As discussed above, the crucial role of neoliberalized agribusiness in global trade and market speculation today has meant a decline in the relative importance of agri-food’s material properties in favour of more explicit fi nancial goals. Despite the rhetoric of food security and the major agri-business corporations publicly claiming to ‘feed the world’, agribusiness is increasingly about business in and for itself, while rural development, nourishment, and food production become less important. Nevertheless, these money-making objectives are shrouded in the mist of consumer sat-isfaction and the discourse of lower prices, which mystify the real impacts of the neoliberalization of agribusiness. Together with its signifi cant tech-nological and economic components (Ioris  2012 ), neoliberalized agri-business has evolved through a constant political eff ort to disguise and 12 A.A.R. Iorissimultaneously justify changes in the contemporary agri-food sector. Even the alleged multifunctionality of today’s agriculture (i.e. a range of economic and non-economic outputs beyond traditional farming pro-duction) often serves to conceal the neoliberal features of agribusiness and mask the fact that agribusiness has not produced a new technological ‘revolution’ or any signifi cant improvement in productivity or techno-logical improvement. Entrepreneurialism and innovation discourses have even appropriated the language of food sovereignty to justify preferential treatment by governments and priority investments (Eakin et al.  2014 ).  In the case of Brazil, the mystifi cation of the neoliberalization of agri-business has followed a dynamics of continuity and change, in which practices, interpersonal relations, and political strategies have been only partially transformed. Agribusiness farmers emphasize their contribution to regional development and economic growth, but only from the per-spective of an intense fi nancialization of agriculture and calling for the removal of environmental, social, and regulatory constraints. Th e sector has demonstrated a competent ability to lobby and promote its interests, particularly via the Brazilian Agribusiness Association (ABAG) created in 1993. Likewise, regular technical visits to production areas coordinated by the Round Table on Responsible Soy (  www.responsiblesoy.org    ), estab-lished in 2006, have tried to improve the image of the Brazilian agri-food sector with a colourful rhetoric of sustainability, certifi cation, and envi-ronmental commitment. However, the rhetoric of entrepreneurialism, competence, and environmental responsibility obscures the fact that the results of agribusiness actually have more to do with the fl exibilization of domestic markets and the deeper insertion of Brazil into global trade. Neoliberalized agribusiness aims to further subordinate agricultural  production to the extraction of surplus value (both from labour and from more-than-human nature) as a creative phenomenon that reconfi gures old agricultural practices and relaunches them in the circles of transna-tional capitalism.  At the same time, the mystifi cation of the success achieved by the agri-business sector helps to conceal internal disputes, particularly between the majority of agribusiness farmers and the stronger players (larger farmers and transnational companies). During her research in areas of agribusiness expansion, Bruno ( 2009 ) identifi ed the construction of a 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 13discourse around modernity, wealth creation, and the value of agribusi-ness (at the expense of other forms of agriculture), but behind closed doors, there are signs of disunity and often unease about the way farm-ers are treated by corporations, banks, and other urban sectors. Another important element of mystifi cation is the confusion about the role of the Brazilian federal state, which has created additional space for national and international corporations, but also retained control of a myriad of mechanisms aimed at promoting agribusiness. Th e transformation of the state apparatus under pressures for fl exible regulation and lower market constraints has led to a new pattern of socionatural interactions, increas-ingly characterized by associations between state agencies, fi nancial capi-tal, and the stronger economic sectors (Ioris  2014 ). Although there has been a massive increase in land prices and an intensifi cation of market transactions, the neoliberalization of rural development since 1990 has left the national state fi rmly in charge of economic fl exibilization. Th is all corroborates the claim that neoliberalized agribusiness is less focused on farm production than during the previous phases of the capitalist economy (Whatmore  1995 ), and more focused on the off -farm fi nancial activities that increasingly dominate supply chains, logistics, and distri-bution systems coordinated and supported by the state.  To summarize this section, neoliberalized agribusiness in Brazil has unfolded in three main dimensions, namely displacement (sectoral and spatial transformations), fi nancialization (prioritizing money-making over agricultural outcomes), and mystifi cation (dissimulation of the neoliber-alizing trends and associated risks and disputes). Th ese three dimensions have complemented and interacted with each other across multiple geo-graphical scales around the planet. It should be noted that this  synthetic framework is not without conceptual and methodological limitations, but it should be considered a starting point for further academic investigations and a tool to foster critical thinking. Th e proposed analytical framework has signifi cant implications for research in human geography, especially within politico-economy and neoliberalism studies, to the extent that it encapsulates interdependent processes that are together responsible for the revitalization of agribusiness and for the legitimization of global agri-food markets. Th e framework has been used to highlight the historico-geographical repercussions of neoliberalized agribusiness in Brazil, where 14 A.A.R. Ioristhe neoliberalization of agribusiness has been an element of conservative responses to the crisis of accumulation caused by the exhaustion of devel-opmental policies and state-led entrepreneurialism.  Instead of agrarian reform and local food, the hegemonic solution was to intensify and revise production procedures according to neolib-eral priorities. Th e neoliberalization of agribusiness in Brazil followed the displacement of traditional areas and industrial sectors in favour of the export of agricultural commodities (soybeans in particular); the growing fi nancialization of production, distribution, and consumption (articu-lated in particular by transnational companies and the need to gener-ate dollars to stabilize national accounts); and numerous mystifi cation strategies to disguise manifold socio-ecological problems. Th e apparent success of the neoliberalization of agribusiness betrays a clear attempt to temporarily placate the structural contradictions of capitalist agricul-ture while novel tensions and reactions become increasingly evident (e.g. cheap food is produced to sustain capital accumulation from agriculture and other economic sectors, but this leads to the actual blackmailing of the national economy by agri-food exports and mounting rates of envi-ronmental degradation and social confl ict). Agribusiness production in Brazil has been a privileged arena for the consolidation of fl exible capital accumulation approaches, while it has been signifi cantly shaped by direct state interventions, widespread forms of violence, and the subordination of agriculture to wider, globalized politico-ecological demands.  As a fi nal point of interest in this section, it is highly emblematic that the advancement of neoliberalized agribusiness in Brazil has had many parallels in the reform of environmental policies and regulation, which have also come under the sphere of infl uence of neoliberal ideologies and market globalization (Ioris  2009 ). New responses to environmen-tal problems have been formulated according to the perverse agenda of ‘ecological modernization’, that is, the claim that existing political and administrative structures can be amended to cope with old and new problems (without considering the need for more signifi cant and mean-ingful politico-economic changes). Th e debate on the weaknesses of envi-ronmental policies adopted in recent decades around the world is vast, but it can be briefl y demonstrated by the evolution of ideas about the economic value and productive role of water, which are considered below.   1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 15    Water, Environment, and Economic Development: The Missing Political Link  Th e allocation and use of water are among the most pressing issues in the contemporary search for better standards of living, social justice, and environmental conservation. To a large extent, this debate has evolved around the need to expand water infrastructure as a requirement for eco-nomic growth, the reversal of ecological degradation, and the enhance-ment of water services. During most of the twentieth century, large sums of public money were invested in water engineering, but over time, it became increasingly evident that traditional interventions were also responsible for water pollution and altered river fl ows, without necessar-ily satisfying basic public demands. Acknowledgement of the shortcom-ings of conventional approaches to water infrastructure has led, since the end of the 1970s, to a review of water policies and government priorities. Emerging environmental awareness and public mobilization, particularly in the political North, also added to the pressure on national govern-ments and multilateral agencies to gradually shift from single engineering initiatives to more comprehensive responses. Informed by concepts such as ‘sustainable development’ and ‘systemic thinking’, new ways of deal-ing with water problems started to shape the global water agenda. Public policies have been particularly infl uenced by the goals of integrated water resources management (IWRM), which include the formulation of ‘holistic’ solutions to water management problems, the reconciliation of multiple demands, and, crucially, appreciation in the economic value of water (Mitchell  2005 ).  Because of this more explicit recognition of the economic value of water, calls for economic effi  ciency and market exposure have occu-pied centre stage in the agenda of water reform. Th is represents a move towards hybrid mechanisms of environmental governance and beyond the state/market/society divisions that allegedly caused most of the mis-takes in previous decades. It is now claimed that adequate solutions to old and new management problems should include not just the direct costs related to project implementation, but also a calculation of the monetary value of water, in order to ‘eliminate ineffi  ciencies and express its full economic potential’ (WAAP  2006 ). According to this position, ‘a major 16 A.A.R. Iorisweakness of past approaches to the water sector has been the excessive reli-ance on overextended government agencies to manage water resources’, while the new agenda calls for ‘greater reliance on pricing and incen-tives’ (World Bank  1993 : 47). Th erefore, the current strategy of applying market-based solutions to environmental problems is expected to foster economic rationality and promote management effi  ciency. Interestingly, international pressures for the adoption of market-inspired reforms have led to a homogenization of water policies around the world, despite major social, cultural, and economic diff erences between countries. For that reason, it is worth asking whether the ongoing reforms have actu-ally resulted in any meaningful solutions to highly contingent and local-ized water problems. Considering the environmental and social statistics available in various United Nations reports and national assessments, it is evident that recent policies have largely failed to achieve environmental restoration or implement a more equitable basis for water allocation and use. Notwithstanding a change in the discourse, in the countries where the ‘new management paradigm’ has been applied, the outcomes of the reforms have been restricted to some bureaucratic improvements and, at best, the removal of isolated, circumstantial problems.  Th e Brazilian experience is a case in point of the inherent limitations of global water reforms, and this chapter intends to discuss the contradic-tory infl uences of neoclassical economics on the ongoing reorganization of water management in Brazil. With the approval of a new water law in 1997, an extensive regulatory apparatus was put in place, mostly infl u-enced by the goals of integrated management, but so far, this has achieved only marginal results in terms of environmental restoration and confl ict resolution. Although the legislation delegated to catchment committees the approval of plans and the reconciliation of spatial diff erences, the core element of new policies has been the expression of the monetary value of water. Despite the rhetoric of environmental sustainability, offi  cial initia-tives continue to subject socionatural water systems to economic exploi-tation and unfair distribution of opportunities. Th e recent approval of hydropower projects by the national administration, for example in the Amazon region (such as in the Rivers Madeira, Tapajós, and Xingu), despite strong public opposition, illustrates the prioritizing of ‘economic growth at any price’. In the same way, newly formed decision-making 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 17forums have been dominated by the same rural oligarchies that tradition-ally controlled economic and social opportunities related to water use and conservation. As a result, instead of promoting a genuine change in public policies, the new approaches have largely preserved the hegemonic interests of landowners, industrialists, construction companies, and real estate investors to the detriment of ecological recovery and the majority of the population. Th is suggests that eff ective responses to water problems require a new basis for the use and conservation of water, which should be constructed according to social justice and environmental sustainabil-ity requirements, free from the pervasive infl uences of market rationality.  Water management has always been one of the dominant themes when economic theory is applied to the environment, including, for example, issues such as the scarcity of water stocks and the social cost of pollution. Because of its permanent circulation, water poses a unique challenge to economists, given that more than one person can appropriate the same unit of water from a common river or aquifer. Another methodological diffi  culty is the fact that water availability is normally concentrated in certain areas or during certain periods of time, while water usage varies according to socio-economic demands, personal preferences, and cultural values. Because of such particular properties, economic literature on the use and conservation of water is extensive and growing rapidly. As early as the eighteenth century, the founders of the discipline discussed the potential scarcity of natural resources in relation to a growing human population. For the resource economists of that period, nature contained a large reserve of raw materials freely available for human exploitation; water was seen as abundant and, consequently, there was minimal need to limit its use (Adam Smith, for example, considered water to be beyond economic value; he described it as a ‘free good’ and, for that reason, dis-tinct from landed property). A few decades later, David Ricardo pointed out that if water existed in ‘moderate abundance’ and could be appropri-ated, it would then aff ord a rent similar to land (Ricardo  1962 [1817] ).  Later, in the nineteenth century, Marxist thought provided an early critique of the worsening of environmental conditions under capital-ist production (Burkett and Foster  2006 ), but it was the work of neo-classical economists that then achieved resonance with policymakers. For instance, J.S. Mill recommended that governments should defi ne 18 A.A.R. Ioris property rights over natural resources—including water and forests—to secure their proper use as an ‘inheritance of the human race’ (Mill  1965 [1871] ). Th e ideas of Marshall ( 1966 [1890] ) about public ame-nities and his marginal theory of value inspired Pigou ( 1938 [1920] ) to describe environmental problems as a divergence between ‘marginal social net product’ and ‘marginal private net product’. According to the marginalist theory, those who benefi t from the use of the environment should internalize the social costs (externalities) of their activities via, for example, the payment of fees and taxes. A little later, Coase ( 1960 ) sub-mitted that government intervention was less important in ensuring the adequate use of resources, since bargaining between players constituted a more eff ective solution. In that case, as long as a regime of explicit ownership can be established, water allocation and pollution problems are solved rationally, as much as water can be bought and sold through the market (Ditwilier  1975 ).  Th e debate between the ‘welfare theory’ (after Pigou) and the ‘free mar-ket theory’ (after Coase) resulted in the establishment of environmental economics, a subdivision of microeconomics applied to the use and con-servation of natural resources. Th e underlying principle behind environ-mental economics was the maintenance, via economic instruments, of suffi  cient habitat features and the observation of a ‘safe minimum stan-dard of conservation’ (Ciriacy-Wantrup  1952 ). For example, economists can develop mathematical approaches to determine potential economic benefi ts and relate these to the acceptable level of impacts caused by a new hydroelectric dam (Bishop  1978 ). Th e key tenet of environmental economics is the recognition of resource scarcity and, thus, the increasing marginal utility of water. Because water is seen as a scarce resource, mon-etary quantifi cation of its value becomes a prerequisite for effi  ciency and sustainability (Rogers et al.  2002 ). Monetary valuation, which has been widely used in decisions about project priorities and mitigation mea-sures, is normally estimated in relation to parameters such as household income, real state fi gures, and personal preferences (Van Houtven et al.  2007 ). Based on monetary valuation, environmental economics nowa-days includes methodologies such as supply–demand management, mar-ginal cost pricing, valuation of water in alternative uses, and  optimization models (Ward  2007 ). 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 19 Crucially, the rationale for environmental economics has many points of convergence with the reasoning behind neoliberal policies and, in particular, the neoliberalization of agribusiness discussed above. Environmental economists claim that valuation techniques can inform choices between numerous potential methods of improving the quantity and the reliability of water supply (Castle  1999 ). However, in practice, assessments informed by environmental economics have fallen short of resolving mounting impacts associated with water supply, irrigation, and hydroelectricity projects. When things go astray, environmental econo-mists normally blame administrative ineffi  ciencies or insuffi  cient data to support decision-making, instead of questioning the political and struc-tural causes of project mistakes. Piecemeal solutions are emblematically exemplifi ed by the use of mathematical models to calculate the market price of water; these ignore the causes of scarcity and the questions of who really benefi ts from water use (e.g. He et al.  2007 ). Environmental economists’ reduction of socio-economic and environmental processes to independent utility functions became a main source of criticism. In the 1960s, neoinstitutional environmental economics started to pay particu-lar attention to processes of institutional change and transaction costs (i.e. costs incurred in dealing with human interaction). For this group of scholars, economic choices are related to a complex array of social func-tions and structures (termed ‘institutions’) raging from court decisions and informal rules to personal beliefs (Swaney  1987 ). It is the institu-tional structure of entitlements (property or liabilities) that infl uences the nature of the bargaining process between two or more parties, in contrast with the exogenous preferences and costless social contracting of neo-classical economics. For example, riparian institutions consolidated over time typically allow some people to use water from rivers while denying access to others, independently of the direct economic outcome of water use. Neoinstitutional economists maintain that the analysis of environ-mental problems should be based on interdependence rather than on externalities (cf. Paavola  2007 ). From an institutional perspective, instead of focusing on the effi  cient use of resources, solving environmental prob-lems requires the determination of collective standards of performance that can reward individual initiative, experimentation, and effi  ciency (Bromley  1991 ). 20 A.A.R. Ioris At the end of the 1980s, a group of academics proposed a related line of investigation under the name of ecological economics. Th e main goal for ecological economists is to encompass production and consumption in a broader sense, moving away from the neoclassical focus on the opti-mal allocation of resources (Daly and Farley  2004 ). Ecological economics has attempted to replace the rigid mindset of environmental econom-ics with a more plural and heuristic perspective (Gowdy and Erickson  2005 ). However, there remains a fundamental tension at the heart of ecological economics: on the one hand, it is committed to a conceptual pluralism; on the other hand, ecological economics is still heavily infl u-enced by the narrow market model of thinking (Burkett  2003 ). Th e per-sistent reliance on market-based solutions to environmental degradation has been a systematic shortcoming of many ecological economists and betrays their frequent association with the mainstream ideas of environ-mental economics. By the same token, conventional neoinstitutionalists have also tended to succumb to the magnetism of environmental eco-nomics and direct their attention to the removal of institutional barriers to the ‘proper’ operation of market forces (e.g. Saleth and Dinar  2005 ).  Th e fundamental area in which mainstream economists fail— including not just environmental, but also many ecological and neoinstitutional authors—is in identifying the contradiction between the expansion of the market rationale and the quest for sustainable and equitable solu-tions to water problems. Despite their persuasive discourse on the aptness of fi nancial incentives and economic instruments of water management, such approaches provide only a narrow and transitory answer to envi-ronmental degradation, while promoting capital accumulation at the expense of social inequalities. Th ese economists fail to accept that market- based policies (which include both market transactions and governmen-tal interventions that regulate the market) do not remove environmental pressures, but instead immediately transform nature conservation into an object of capital accumulation. If the exploitation of natural resources by market forces has historically been responsible for the commodifi ca-tion of nature, ‘ecological modernization’ has attempted to use the same market rationality to prevent or remedy environmental degradation. However, ‘green capitalism’ has ultimately produced new markets for eco-logical goods (e.g. pollution emissions trading and markets for  ecological 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 21 services), which comprise commodities that are simultaneously excavated (in exchange-value terms) from pre-existing socionatural relations and, as part of their production, are reinserted or remain embedded in social-ized nature. Th e ‘greening’ of capitalism has not changed the fact that environmental degradation continues to result from the inherent char-acteristics of the capitalist mode of production, such as private property, competition, the goal of producing exchange values instead of use values, the recurrent fi nancial crisis, and the specifi c shaping of technology in the interests of extracting and appropriating a maximum surplus value (Liodakis  2000 ).  For mainstream economists, issues of power asymmetry and class, gen-der, and race discrimination have either been left out of the debate or contained in a secondary agenda of social compensation (epitomized by Sweden’s annual World Water Week). Because of the focus on isolated elements of water systems, the prevailing school of water economics has largely ignored the power inequalities behind decision-making structures (e.g. Heinz et al.  2007 ) and remains silent on the fact that water manage-ment problems are profoundly infl uenced by cultural circumstances and political disputes. Th us, there is little consideration of social inequalities associated with the use and conservation of water, which directly depend on the incorporation of the biophysical materiality of nature into capital accumulation (Sneddon  2007 ), as well as on the cultural context where water is used for the production and exchange of commodities (Page  2005 ). Th e realization that the economy cannot be dissociated from natural and social survivability, nor from ethics and justice, opens a new arena for academics to engage with water management problems. Th e social and environmental challenges of the globalized economy require, according to Martinez-Alier ( 2002 ), a close cooperation between critical ecological economics and political ecology. Leff  ( 1996 : 146) argues that we need a ‘political economy of the environment’ that understands pov-erty, unemployment, and the destruction of natural resources as eff ects of given relations of production. Rather than the political neutrality advocated by mainstream economists, the starting point of the economic analysis is the fact that the use and appropriation of water describes a fundamental connection between fl ows of water, fl ows of commodities, and fl ows of power (Swyngedouw  2004 ). Th e task at hand is to creatively 22 A.A.R. Ioriscombine a critique of the prevailing economic paradigm with the for-mulation of alternative models of social organization and economic pro-duction, something that Agyeman and Evans ( 2004 ) have called ‘just sustainability’. In particular, critical economists cannot be unaware of the uneven balances of power that deprive certain social groups of adequate access to water and protection from environmental degradation. It is not too late to consider that ‘unless analyses of development begin not with the symptoms, environmental or economic instability, but with the cause, social injustice, then no development can be sustainable’ (Middleton and O’Keefe  2001 : 16).  Considering the two last sections, it is possible to conclude that there are similarities between the exacerbated infl uence of mainstream econom-ics over the recent reform of the water sector and experiences of agricul-tural modernization along the lines of the neoliberalization of state and economy. Such reforms did not happen in a vacuum, but are intimately related to the patterns of economic production and consumption pro-moted under economic globalization. For those who can pay, the global-ized economy can provide wasteful lifestyles, which increasingly depend on large volumes of water and electricity. For the poorer strata of society, however, globalization has brought new threats to livelihoods and addi-tional pressures over shared natural resources (Newell  2009 ). By and large, contemporary water policies have been limited by technocratic insistence on the internalization of costs and the optimization of resources, while social justice and collective responsibilities for the  degradation of shared resources have been left out of the agenda. Prioritizing economic rational-ity when seeking solutions to environmental and agricultural problems only tends to perpetuate environmental exploitation and social exclu-sion. However, it has been mentioned elsewhere that market solutions are inadequate when it comes to dealing with stochastic and complex ecological systems, because they create a ‘policy lock-in’ that precludes dynamic adjustments (Bromley  2007 ). In other words, the priority given to the economic dimension of environmental management and agricul-tural production is nothing other than the mainstream political para-digm refl ecting its view of itself. As Bowles ( 2004 : 256) observes, market forces have more than just an allocative role; they also exert a disciplinary  function that operates, in reality, through the asymmetric use of power. 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 23 At the same time, while acknowledging the harmful impacts of mar-ket pressures, it is also important to avoid explaining such problems as solely the result of broader economic priorities. On the contrary, there are other fundamental factors that contribute at local level to policy and management failures. As observed by Prudham ( 2004 : 334), only the juxtaposition of the hegemonic character of market society with specifi c politico-ecological contradictions can ‘reveal the crisis tendencies of envi-ronmental neoliberalism’. For instance, the new water regulatory regime introduced in the 1990s in Brazil attempted, but failed, to provide straightforward answers to multilayered water and environmental ques-tions. Th e fundamental shortcoming of new approaches is the ideological separation between environmental degradation and social inequalities. Because of this fundamental dichotomy, policies derived from the new water legislation have neglected the social and political context where decisions are made and projects implemented (Ioris  2011 ). Th ey have overlooked the crucial fact that water problems in Brazil are closely related to rural land tenure, uneven urban development, and socio- economic opportunities, issues that have mostly been excluded from the scope of the water reforms. Policy instruments of the new regime, which include user charges and fl exible water regulation, were superimposed on a political system based on discriminatory practices at national and local scales. Almost all the changes are restricted to the top level of poli-cymaking, with very limited impacts on local problems of water use and conservation. Some improvements in terms of public participation and environmental restoration do not represent a commitment by politicians or public agencies, but are convenient mechanisms for minimizing public opposition to the implementation of the new regulatory regime.  Alternatives to mainstream water and agricultural management require, fi rst and foremost, denouncing the rationality of neoclassical economics and its commanding infl uence over public policies. For instance, it must be recognized that water management problems can only be resolved by bringing together local (e.g. catchment) demands and national and inter-national resistance to the expansion of a market-based society. Alternatives to the ecological and food crisis can only emerge if anti-systemic social movements unite against the endless accumulation of capital. In other words, improvements in the agricultural and environmental sector 24 A.A.R. Iorismake no sense unless these involve a wider impact on the totality of the  globalized economy and, therefore, form part of the construction of a new basis for socionatural interactions. It is also clear that there is an urgent need for dedicated and critical research on the interconnections between agriculture, natural resources, and potential future development.      In Search of Critical Thinking on Agribusiness, Environment, and Development  Among many other comparable national experiences that should be explored, Brazil represents an emblematic case of neoliberalized agri-culture in need of further investigation. Th is is for two main reasons: fi rst, the steady expansion of soybean and other agricultural commodities towards central savannahs and southern sections of the Amazon forest; and second, the fact that agribusiness exports are a key strategic sector of the mainstream project to integrate the country into globalized markets. Furthermore, the contentious features of agribusiness are also relevant to help understand the challenging risks and responsibilities of agricul-ture in the contemporary, increasingly urbanized, and technical world. Corporate, industrial-scale agribusiness practices in Brazil bring back some forgotten (or spectral) elements of capitalism, which never actually disappeared, and in which the invisible becomes visible again. Th is is a phenomenon of multiple dialectics that needs further theoretical, meth-odological, and investigative elaboration. Contemporary agribusiness is a sectoral activity carried out by a highly specialized professional category, but it has had major macroeconomic repercussions, such as the miti-gation of the failures of socio-economic policies promoted by populist governments in thrall to the prevailing neoliberal paradigm. It is not only based on the long history of territorial politics introduced in the middle of the twentieth century, but also borrows and uses the most advanced technologies developed in Brazil and beyond. Agribusiness leaders claim that because of intensifi cation and the supposed rationality of produc-tion, their activity is rescuing or ameliorating the image of development in the country, but in practice, the results continue to be short-lived and are mostly appropriated by old and new elite groups. 1 Agribusiness Failures, Controversies and Uncertainties 25 All those dialectical processes mean that the neoliberalization of agri-business has been developing as a very special case in relation to the globalized food regime. Due to the scale of production and magnitude of these processes, it could be said that Brazil is creating and resiliently embarking on its own model of agriculture, that is, an authentic Brazilian agri-food regime. Th is idiosyncratic regime, uniquely, mixes the unfash-ionable practices of development as production that characterized the Fordist phase of agriculture with the highly fi nancialized agriculture of globalized markets. One main aspect that deserves to be properly inves-tigated is its convoluted relationship between agribusiness and the state apparatus. Given that the state receives most of the blame for the day-to- day problems of agribusiness, such as the cost and quality of transport, the lack of friendly loans or subsidies, and its inability to resolve agrarian confl icts, it is important to note that the state is the ultimate safety net, which in bad years must compensate for too much or too little rain, diseases, low prices, and so on. Th e activity is not without contradic-tions. Th e national agribusiness sector is professionally organized and aggressively lobbies all the agencies and layers of the state, but aware-ness is growing that the sector is limited when it comes to dealing with socio-ecological issues such as growing threats from insects and diseases, climate change, and land-based struggles. As much as sophisticated tech-nology and precision machinery, agribusiness is increasingly associated with clashes with non-unionized rural workers and labourers, indigenous groups, and descendents of slaves, and the prospects are grim and likely to aggravate the level of violence.

Decision-makers with responsibility for this rapidly developing arena of cross-sectoral policy quite reasonably seek a future in which system interdepen-dencies will be recognised, priorities for management assigned, and responsibilities for action borne fairly. In England, for instance, the         R.  D.   Fish      ((cid:13))   University of Kent ,   Canterbury ,  UK         A.  A.R.   Ioris      University of Edinburgh ,   Edinburgh ,  UK         N.  M.   Watson      Lancaster University ,   Lancaster ,  UK     government department with responsibility for sustainable rural devel-opment recently published its strategy for water (DEFRA  2008 ), setting out a vision that positions agricultural systems as central to the process of resolving competing issues of water supply and demand, and water quality and quantity by the year 2030. While priorities for action vary greatly according to political and material circumstances, parallel calls can be found elsewhere (Blanco  2008 ; Conca  2006 ; Faby et al.  2005 ; Lemos and Oliveira  2005 ; Swatuk  2005 ). Driven in part by the exi-gencies of an increasingly congested terrain of international agreements (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity) and laws (such as the pan-European Water Framework Directive), what holds this diversity together is the recognition that fragmented policymaking and imple-mentation across the agricultural and water sectors continues to be a systematic and deeply institutionalised feature of natural resource man-agement and, consequently, a major obstacle to the realisation of sus-tainable livelihoods and development.  Recent calls to address agriculture and water as linked policy and scientifi c agendas refl ect, of course, the changing nature of priorities. For example, current interest in England for devising strategies that can mitigate the risks of diff use pollution from agriculture to water is partly the consequence of a concerted eff ort during the 1970s and 1980s to intervene—primarily via regulation of privatised utilities—in problems of domestic, industrial, and urban water management. Th at is to say, as signifi cant gains in one arena of environmental protection have been made, ‘blind spots’ of regulation have also been revealed. Th us, the scientifi c and regulatory focus of action has changed as insight and public concern have evolved. At the same time, new prob-lems with new complexities for the water and the agriculture sectors are emerging. Th e aforementioned strategy for water in England pub-lished by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Aff airs (DEFRA) is governed, in large part, by wider climate change agendas, and the need to build long-term resilience among urban and rural communities through the eff ective management of land–water interac-tions. Indeed, agriculture’s role in infl uencing the water cycle is central to discussions of how climate change risks are managed and mitigated (Th orne et al.  2007 ). 34 R.D. Fish et al. In recent years, bodies of work have duly emerged seeking to explain how the codependencies of land, water, and human well-being can be shaped according to the principles of sustainable development. From ‘integrated water management’ (e.g. Furey and Lutyens  2008 ) and ‘inte-grated catchment management’ (e.g. Prato and Herath  2007 ) to ‘inte-grated water resources management’ (e.g. Saravanan et al.  2009 ) and ‘integrated environmental management’ (e.g. Reagan  2006 ), this varie-gated literature is important not only in the way it amplifi es the types of natural and social scientifi c research required to understand these code-pendencies, but also in signalling, quite clearly, the complex and chang-ing institutional and political conditions of management. In particular, one common line of reasoning in this work is to understand processes of natural resource management as being shaped, to an increasing extent, by the principles and practices of ‘governance’. Th is is a concept designed to point to the broadening and deepening of non-state activity in the policy process. It is closely related to wider normative debates about the need to foster more equitable, responsive, and politically engaged forms of decision-making. In this chapter, we critically inspect this idea and its implications for this special edition’s specifi c concern with ‘integrating water and agricultural management’ (hitherto ‘IWAM’).  Th e text begins by considering the origins of the governance agenda, outlining its key tenets, and explaining how it is potentially taking sci-ence and policy into new conceptual and practical territory. We explain the discrepancies that surround this terrain, drawing attention to a body of work critiquing not only its empirical reality, but its underlying nor-mative claims. Nonetheless, we argue that the regulatory thrust of the governance agenda—towards more collaborative and holistic approaches to working—is essentially well founded or at least is a step in the right direction. Th e chapter then considers how these concerns might best be approached as an adaptive form of environmental management, one based on a commitment to dialogue, deliberation, and negotiation among stakeholder groups with vested, often competing assessments of policy priorities. Th e corollary to this, we suggest, is a series of interesting questions surrounding the role and nature of research, not least the mat-ter of how to foster eff ective models of cross-disciplinary working that can create the kind of evidence base required to inform adaptive policy 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 35processes. We consequently argue that land and water governance and research have to be approached diff erently in the future if the process of integrating multi-sector and multi-scalar natural resource systems of management is to be realised in eff ective ways.      The Institutional Challenges of IWAM  Th e institutional basis for developing integrated approaches to water and agricultural management is complex and multifaceted. Interpreted broadly, institutional structures and processes that underpin the for-mation and implementation of public policy are political, legal, eco-nomic, social, and administrative, in character (Mitchell  1990 ; Saleth and Dinar  2005 ). We suggest these structures and processes present a dynamic, and often contested, context in which to gauge prospects for IWAM. Th e situation in England and Wales illustrates this point well. Here, many of the companies providing public water supply and sewerage services are owned and operated by multinational corpora-tions, while the regulation of the industry involves a central govern-ment department (DEFRA), a non-departmental agency (Environment Agency), an economic regulator (Offi  ce of Water Services), and an independent monitoring body (Drinking Water Inspectorate) (Watson et al.  2009 ). Th ere are also complex arrangements for environmental protection that place these institutions within wider policy networks encompassing (among others) bodies with statutory responsibility for nature conservation (such as Natural England), designated authorities for protected landscapes (such as the National Park Authority), as well as regional and local government. In all of this, important cross-sectoral linkages between the water and agricultural sectors can be identifi ed at the level of policy design, and indeed a multitude of partnership arrangements for spatial entities such as river basins, catchments, and coastal zones are duly emerging as platforms for more integrated forms of land and water management. As elsewhere in the European Union (EU), an important case in point here would be the development of pol-icy platforms that can respond to the emerging mandates of the Water Framework Directive. Even so, this potential for cross-sectorality belies 36 R.D. Fish et al.a deeper institutional complexity. Debates about integrated approaches to agriculture and water systems are not, of course, conducted in iso-lation. Priorities for both sectors are implicated in a multi-scalar and contested political economy and bear the wider institutional infl uence of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), professional associations, consumer groups, and, perhaps most notably in the context of agri-culture, trade organisations. Th is means that the institutional basis of shared programmes of action  within , as much as  between , the water and agricultural sectors are by no means assured.  For some, overcoming this complexity is less a matter of how to foster more coordinated institutional responses to water and agricultural man-agement, but more about fundamental changes in the way policy pro-cesses now take shape and assert infl uence. In particular, recent years have witnessed an emerging debate over whether we have entered an era of ‘governance’ (Higgins and Lawrence  2005 ; Hooper  2005 ; Bakker  2006 ; Warner  2007 ; Pahl-Wostl et al.  2008 ; Pahl-Wostl  2009 ). Th is is an idea used to point to a change in the relationship between the state and civil society and the way in which responsibilities for the provision of envi-ronmental quality and other public goods are thought by some to have shifted since the 1980s (Pierre  2000 ). Specifi cally, it is suggested that the historically central role of the state and its bureaucracies in activities of planning, regulation, policy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation has been recast under the ascent of more liberalised economic regimes. As a consequence, it is claimed that regulatory and institutional decision- making increasingly involves actors operating beyond the boundaries of formal government as well as traditional state-based agencies and bureau-cracies. Th us, it is argued that new spaces for policymaking have emerged, which are occupied by a diverse range of self-organising actor networks, public–private partnerships, and other multiparty arrangements. In an era of governance, then, distinctions and boundaries that previously defi ned state–market–civil society relations are thought to have increas-ingly blurred (Bevir  2009 ).  For those interested in natural resources and the environment, the claim that we have entered an era of ‘governance’ brings with it a new set of challenges. As Tropp ( 2007 ) argues in the context of water man-agement, governance-based management relies on developing more 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 37‘sociocratic’ forms of knowledge and capacity development, putting the emphasis on the management of people and processes, organisational diversity, and knowledge sharing. Yet the extent to which such a trans-formation is possible and the degree to which governments are ready and willing to share power with non-state actors remains unclear; trans-formation and participation are always the object of political contesta-tion. While in principle government departments and public authorities are now often required to interact on more equal terms with other social ‘players’ and alongside a host of other powerful non-state entities (Stoker  1998 ), the role and the infl uence of non-state actors in decision-making processes remains uneven and highly contested. In purely practical terms, the orchestration of multiple actors and interests and the marshalling of collective action are diffi  cult tasks themselves. Working eff ectively in an era of governance means challenging entrenched attitudes and prac-tices, overcoming organisational resistance to change, and mobilising individuals to engage with seemingly intractable, cross-sectoral environ-mental problems. Perhaps more critically, Petersen et al. ( 2009 ) argue that, while a governance approach favours the collective resolution of problems, it is often the state that continues to take ultimate respon-sibility, particularly where blame or liability cannot be established due to uncertainty, poor data, and/or lack of evidence. As a result, there is a risk that, when superfi cially adopted, a governance approach simply serves to renew and re-emphasise state power (and the infl uence of the stronger groups of interest) in environmental politics, rather than fun-damentally changing the policy formulation or implementation process. Similar arguments have been made elsewhere. Writing in the context of water management and the provision of water services, Bakker ( 2003 ) explains that governance-based decision-making can amount to a pro-cess of re-regulation in which tacit state control of the allocation and management of resources remains. A related observation has been made by Ioris ( 2009 ), who demonstrates how the main policy instruments of water governance are often appropriated by the stronger stakeholder groups and, in circumstances of a weak institutional context, result in the maintenance of long-lasting management problems and associated asymmetrical power relations. As such, collective action to integrate water and agriculture within a governance framework cannot be taken 38 R.D. Fish et al.as a given or neutral procedure. Indeed, for some, governance remains a deeply problematic concept which fails to take adequate account of the politics and power relationships that exist within resource management regimes (Castro  2007 ; Mollinga  2008 ).  If there is a tendency to overlook the fact that interventions in water and land systems by diff erent categories of stakeholders (characterised by unequal political opportunities and varied access to resources) tend to generate costs, benefi ts, and risks in uneven ways (Molle  2007 ), it is also the case that the challenges of dealing with multiple actors with competing interests and values are now exacerbated by problems of scale and spatial ‘fi t’. It is notable here that the catchment area or river basin is often represented as the most eff ective operational scale for managing land–water dynamics (cf. Oliver et al.  2009 ), but in institutional terms, such prescriptions are often problematic (Moss  2003 ). Experience in integrated catchment management has shown, for instance, that the eff ectiveness of catchment-scale policy interventions is frequently lim-ited by factors such as multiple overlapping agency and organisational jurisdictions, fragmented and poorly coordinated administrative struc-tures and processes, diff erences in power, unclear lines of responsibil-ity and authority, and slow and unresponsive decision-making. It is in this vein that social scientists have argued that catchments are more than just a landscape carved by the fl ow of water from headwaters to the mouth, but an unstable, ‘permeable’, and evolving socio-ecological system (Molle  2007 ).  To the extent that catchment-scale planning continues to be posi-tioned as the site where integrated governance and resource man-agement will be realised, it remains clear that at least some of these systemic failings can only be addressed by reconciling catchment poli-tics with the higher and lower scales of governance that produce them. Th at is to say, the process of joining up the governance of agriculture and water management depends as much on enhancing the vertical linkages among decision-making nodes at diff erent spatial and insti-tutional scales as it does on fostering closer horizontal links between the two sectors. In this sense, the drivers of change which shape these systems are eff ectively unbounded and operate outside and inside of the biophysical parameters of catchment systems. Th is seems certainly the 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 39case when we think of water management in the context of agricultural change. Th e local practices of farmers are shaped by a wider politi-cal economy of agriculture which may not be necessarily in step with the goals of sustainable water management. In Europe, processes of trade liberalisation and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, for instance, are major drivers of land use change (Potter and Tilzey  2007 ), yet such factors are rarely, if ever, acknowledged or fully addressed within water policy. Furthermore, the water management community has a tendency to portray agriculture simply as a cause of both water quality and quantity problems while failing to acknowledge its vital role in food production and maintaining rural livelihoods.  To summarise, institutional arrangements for both water and agri-culture are complex and multidimensional, encompassing networks of ‘loosely coupled’ state and non-state actors. For some, these arrangements characterise a transition towards more governance-based approaches to natural resource management, though empirical reality of this transi-tion is by no means settled. As we have shown, the idea of governance is inevitably a highly contested and politicised process through which resources are allocated and benefi ts and costs are distributed. In such circumstances, IWAM cannot be treated as a purely technical or scien-tifi c matter. It requires the development of a process that is capable of making trade-off s among competing objectives and reconciling diff erent values and beliefs regarding the use and management of land and water. Th is presents considerable challenges for many IWAM-related agendas today, not least in addressing the institutional ramifi cations of managing water and agricultural systems across spatial scales. From a scientifi c per-spective, the catchment, watershed, or river basin may appear to be the most logical scale for the integration of water management and agricul-ture (Newson  2008 ). Nevertheless, many of the market and institutional processes that drive and regulate both water management and agriculture operate at entirely diff erent scales. As such, IWAM requires an approach to governance that is capable of working both inside and outside the frame of catchment management and is able to deal with the dynamic relationships between water and agricultural systems. Th e question of how these challenges might be addressed within a governance framework for IWAM is examined in the following section.  40 R.D. Fish et al.    Towards Alternative Models of Governance  One of the central social science challenges to emerge from these  complexities is the identifi cation of approaches to governance which can satisfactorily cope with unbounded system interconnections. Th is would be relatively easy if it were simply a matter of constraining uncertainty and complexity by cumulatively investing in more sophisticated scientifi c research. However, such an approach overlooks important philosophi-cal arguments about the limits of knowledge in a complex and rapidly changing world. As the scale of the unit of analysis is expanded from a single farm up to an entire catchment area and beyond, an increas-ing number of systems, interactions, feedback, and non-linearities are brought in to play. Th is results in a step change in the nature of the uncertainty that has to be confronted, moving from ‘risk’ where predic-tion is possible through to ‘ignorance’ and even situations of ‘indetermi-nacy’, where understandings of system boundaries and interactions are defi ed because they are in constant fl ux (Wynne  1992 ). In the absence of certainty, it is inevitable that issues such as managing the eff ects of agriculture on nutrient pollution or fl ood risk or agricultural demand for water tend to be highly controversial. Indeed, recognising the boundaries of what it is possible to know in a limited period of time and reaching consensus when data and evidence are lacking are indicative of the fun-damental challenges associated with IWAM. It is clear that governance models with the capacity to cope with these sorts of ‘messy’ or ‘turbu-lent’ conditions must be created (Trist  1980 ). Conventional models that emphasise rational- comprehensive and technocratic styles of policymak-ing dominated by government bureaucracies are unlikely to be a good match in these circumstances.  In recent years, more collaborative forms of governance have started to emerge in a variety of diff erent spatial and environmental contexts in response to the perceived defi ciencies of technical knowledge and, we contend, have great potential for dealing with the challenges of IWAM (Wondolleck and Yafee  2000 ; Armitage et al.  2008 ). Drawing on theo-retical arguments concerning communicative rationality, discourse, and policy dialogue (Habermas  1981 ; Innes and Booher  1999 ),  collaboration is posited as a highly interactive and adaptive process that is capable of 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 41transforming social relations by creating new knowledge networks among interdependent actors and interests. Th is can include interests with little or no prior experience of each other because they operate in socially and organisationally separate domains at entirely diff erent spatial scales, or those who have been historically engaged in competition or confl ict over underlying institutional, commercial, or cultural priorities. In this vein, Dengler ( 2007 ) demonstrates how diff erent organisations and groups, while invested with diff erent degrees of power, can work together to achieve agreed policy outcomes, and advocates a regime of governance based on sharing expertise between complementary organisations, so called ‘knowledge-based’ governance.  Conventional styles of policymaking have certainly involved inter-actions across institutional and social boundaries, often in the form of cooperative agreements and eff orts to coordinate policies and practices. However, these are relatively short-term arrangements designed to allow each party to pursue separate goals and objectives under stable policy conditions. In these circumstances, government agencies often remain in control of the decision-making process with limited accountability. Collaborative governance, in contrast, involves a more sophisticated, emergent, and enduring form of interaction in which two or more groups pool understanding and/or tangible resources to address a set of prob-lems which neither could solve alone (after Gray  1985 ). It is a process in which organisations and groups are required to re-examine basic assump-tions, beliefs, attitudes, and values through iterative cycles of knowledge exchange, dialogue, deliberation, and negotiation. It is suggested that through this process, joint understandings and commitments for action begin to emerge (Watson  2007 ).  In practical terms, collaboration involves a number of phases (Fig.  2.1 ), as well as opportunities and constraints which are shaped by prevail-ing economic, social, political, and environmental conditions (Watson  2004 ). Often, collaboration is initiated as a result of several factors, such as a perceived environmental threat or crisis, a new legal mandate, or the availability of fi nancial incentives. When an initial commitment to collaboration has been made, a ‘problem-setting’ phase occurs in which groups with legitimate stakes are identifi ed and the nature of the joint problem or issue they face is articulated (Gray  1989 ; McCann  1993 ). As 42 R.D. Fish et al.a result, stakeholders begin to appreciate their interdependence and the need to act together. In the subsequent ‘direction-setting’ phase, partici-pating organisations focus on desirable future conditions as well as the underlying values, beliefs, and principles that will guide them towards their joint ambitions and aspirations. Th is tends to be followed by a ‘structuring phase’ in which specifi c goals and objectives are established, programmes of activity are designed, and roles and responsibilities are assigned to the various participating organisations and groups. Although some commentators regard this to be the end of the process, others have argued that collaboration should generate outputs, such as policies and programmes (Selin and Chavez  1995 ), which must be implemented in order for measurable outcomes to be realised.   While it is convenient to conceptualise collaboration as a well-defi ned process, in practice, some of the phases may occur simultane-ously and several cycles may be required over time before satisfactory results are achieved. In other cases, changes in knowledge or circum-stances may require the participants to return to one or more of the earlier phases of activity in order to redefi ne problems, objectives, or working arrangements. CONTEXTUALCONDITIONSOutputs &OutcomesProblem–settingStructuringDirection–setting  Fig. 2.1    Conceptual framework for collaborative governance        2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 43 According to Innes and Booher ( 2003 ), this sort of collaborative approach is not just a method for solving complex problems in the exist-ing policy system, but crucially is a way of establishing new networks through which capabilities can be developed and sustained. Eff ective col-laboration can be identifi ed from four immediate or fi rst-order results: reciprocity, relationships, learning, and creativity. Collaborative dialogue can lead to the establishment of reciprocal relationships among the par-ticipants as they begin to appreciate their interdependence. A reciprocal agreement might involve compromises among the participants but it can also lead to a situation where one group is able to take action at little or no extra cost which may have benefi ts for others. Such situations arise when there is a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to a common vision of a future that is more desirable than present-day con-ditions. It is important to realise that reciprocity is not a predetermined or straightforward attribute of the interplay among stakeholders, but is a constructed quality that helps groups to do joint work and to build trust. Th at is why successful collaboration also builds relationships and social capital based on mutual understanding and respect. It is precisely these kinds of enduring human and interorganisational resources that enable collaborative governance to cope with uncertainty, changing con-ditions, contested knowledge, and confl ict, conditions which are closely associated with the objectives of the IWAM agenda. A further result of collaboration is collective learning. Participants not only learn about the problem at hand and how scientists and lay groups understand it, but also typically learn about the values and norms of the other interests and actors involved. More fundamentally, engagement in collaboration can eventually lead to deep ‘double-loop learning’, whereby the values, beliefs, and norms of a participating group are transformed (Argyris and Schön  1978 ; Pahl- Wostl  2002 ,  2009 ). Problem-framings, aims, objec-tives, and strategies may be adjusted on the basis of the shared under-standing that emerges from collaboration. Finally, one of the greatest virtues of collaboration is that it encourages out-of-the-box thinking and creativity. Potential strategies and solutions which might otherwise be dismissed as irrelevant or poorly informed are likely to receive more considered and careful  attention in an environment where alternative 44 R.D. Fish et al.views and perspectives are valued and respected. Ultimately, eff ective collaboration can lead to system adaptations because of the shared iden-tities, meanings, heuristic principles, and innovations that it creates. It is precisely these kinds of system adaptations that are needed in order to bring about the integration of water and agriculture.  It should be noted that this analysis is not designed to imply that col-laboration is unproblematic. Indeed, one of the main challenges of this approach to governance and problem-solving is to maintain trust and commitment to shared long-term goals when obstacles are encountered and when evidence of progress is only weak. Potential benefi ts as well as challenges and risks associated with collaborative approaches to the gov-ernance of land and water are summarised in Table  2.1 .   Table 2.1    Potential benefi ts, challenges, and risks of collaboration    Benefi ts  Challenges and risks  Improved personal, social, and interorganisational relations  Increased transaction costs due to the number of actors involved and the added complexity of decision-making  Access to alternative sources and forms of scientifi c and lay knowledge  ‘Capture’ or diversion of the process due to asymmetrical power relations among the participants  Deep learning, leading to the exploration of underlying values, assumptions, attitudes, and expectations  Potential ‘implementation gaps’ arising from diffi culties in translating agreed plans into polices, projects, and actions  Reframing of complex issues and questions, leading to enhanced problem-solving capacity  Failure to broker agreement in the face of uncertainty, limited data, or contested knowledge  Legitimisation of decisions through consensual decision-making  Maintaining trust among organisations with different cultures, norms, and practices  Commitment to long-term goals and future visions  Ensuring the benefi ts and costs of collaboration are fairly distributed among the participants  Leverage of additional fi nancial, technical, administrative, and political resources  Maintaining commitment to long-term goals when evidence of progress may be limited  Reallocation of roles and responsibilities according to organisational capacities and skills 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 45   Perhaps most signifi cantly, the obstacles of making a full transition from old systems of governing and policymaking to a new ethic and regime of collaborative governance should not be underestimated. Other models of policymaking, which rely more on political infl uence, technocratic tools, and bureaucratic structures, are deeply embedded in the institutional systems of agriculture and water and will not eas-ily be removed or reformed. At the individual level, personnel involved in either sector may inadvertently preserve values and practices that refl ect centralised, unresponsive modes of governance when trying to achieve collaboration. What this implies is that the future development of IWAM governance is likely to be hesitant and contested because the process of implementation brings together diff erent perspectives, values, norms, and customs. Much will rest on the level of political and scien-tifi c support given to the process of integrating water and agriculture and the ability of government ministers and civil servants as well as non-governmental stakeholders to push through institutional reforms aimed at improving genuine collaboration.  Ultimately, a viable approach to governance for agriculture and water systems must be capable of integrating multiple voices and rec-onciling competing interests. Dealing with complexity and uncer-tainty requires innovative strategies to the relations among social groups and between society and the state apparatus which can foster constructive and enduring collaboration. Th is means that governance is not just about changing the format of policymaking or management activities, but also about a profound shift in terms of commitment to working together to understand, and constructively resolve, shared problems. Collaboration creates some of the conditions upon which legitimate actions depend even in the face of uncertainty and political and socio-economic diff erences among groups or spatial areas. It is the most appropriate model for achieving this change because of its commitment to dialogue, deliberation, and negotiation. By enabling reciprocal agreements, establishing enduring institutional and social relationships, promoting learning, and encouraging creativity, collab-orative governance has the potential to produce the kinds of transfor-mations which IWAM is seeking to achieve.  46 R.D. Fish et al.    Integrating the ‘Social’ and ‘Natural’ in Land–Water Research  In the same way that integration challenges current thinking about gov-ernance and policymaking, it raises equally fundamental questions about how academic research should be organised and conducted. As clients of this new policy agenda, single-discipline researchers with historically little reason (or perhaps inclination) to share the same intellectual space must now navigate a stable pathway through a fundamental and seem-ingly intractable set of issues regarding how scientists—as a diverse com-munity of social and natural science researchers—describe and construct the realities of water and land management, acquire and marshal knowl-edge for the purposes of closer integration, and judge the effi  cacy of our interventions. Th ese are just some of the questions that characterise the problem of creating and operating within integrated research ‘platforms’ (Warner  2007 ). For some, this might imply a compromise and dilution of standard disciplinary pathways to knowledge and understanding, the idea that integrated thinking lies at the ‘shallow end’ of water research. For others, progress towards the application of these policy goals is not only producing novel theoretical constructs in the arena of land–water research but also driving the formation of new study areas that do not respect neat disciplinary boundaries (see Lane et al.  2006 ). At the same time, the outputs of joined-up research on agri-water systems from research must refl ect the needs of policy and practice if there is to be any real prospect of making new knowledge relevant and ‘useful’.  Given the simultaneously human and non-human complexion of land–water systems, it is perhaps not surprising that collaboration across the social and natural sciences is regarded as a necessary, and underpin-ning, facet of integrated land–water policy. One of the common pre-sumptions behind this view is that we can create holistic understandings of land–water systems rather like fi tting together a jigsaw puzzle, with cognate specialisms and expertise adding up to a complete picture. In essence, the logic is that the natural and social sciences, by their very nature, are concerned with diff erent parts of a connected reality: the nat-ural sciences accounting for the environmental manifestations of human 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 47and non-human processes, the social sciences for the economic, social, political, and cultural relations that condition and give rise to them. In other words, the rationale behind this ‘additive’ world view rests on the notion that the social and natural sciences are compatible with each other because they prioritise diff erent thematic areas in the study of land–water interactions. By working collectively, it is argued, social and natural sci-ence researchers are therefore able to make up for disciplinary defi ciencies and forge innovative approaches to complex questions.  Holistic scientifi c working involving the meshing together of diff er-ent types of preoccupations and expertise is a fundamentally attractive idea, yet two key challenges emerge with it. Th e fi rst of these challenges concerns the need to reconcile the prevalent divergence between natu-ral and social science research. Th at is to say, an important precondi-tion of joined-up approaches  between  the natural and social sciences is to foster coherent conceptual and methodological narratives  within  them. In the natural sciences, this problem has been addressed by Haygarth et al. ( 2005 ), who, specifi cally in the case of phosphorus research, draw attention to the diff erent cognate specialisms underpinning this fi eld of inquiry and highlight the kind of challenges (and possibilities) arising for the research community when seeking to create collaborative and mutu-ally reinforcing agendas in the context of contrasting methodological logics. An equivalent analysis of the social sciences shows that econom-ics, political science, geography, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and planning, to name but a few, all have something of value to off er to the IWAM debate. While cross-fertilisation of ideas (and careers) among these fi elds makes it diffi  cult to appreciate how exactly each has added to the understanding of water management and agriculture, it is certainty the case that this community has produced a rich mix of research pri-orities and fostered varied pathways to an understanding of the relations between society and nature (Haberl et al.  2006 ; Waterton et al.  2006 ; Dixon and Sharp  2007 ; Giller et al.  2008 ; Jansen  2009 ).  Given this, some of the principal cross-disciplinary preoccupations of social science approaches are depicted in Fig.  2.2 , which highlights three arenas of inquiry around which it seeks to understand the politics of land–water management: structural trends, capacities to act, and insti-tutional complexity. Each of these cognate areas of inquiry provides the 48 R.D. Fish et al.analytical insights necessary to promote eff ective pathways to collabora-tive governance. Th us, sites of inquiry shift from studies of ‘capacity’ in which the concern is to unpack how attitudes, responsibilities, knowl-edge, and capital come to shape the behaviour of individuals and groups, through to an account of the territorial and sectoral jurisdictions that infl uence frameworks of interventions across multiple scales, and fi nally into the analysis of ‘structural trends’—cultural and economic—that dic-tate wider terms in which inclinations and capacities to act take shape. What this implies is that IWAM-related research must seek to understand how these domains interact to produce barriers and opportunities for eff ective action, the fi rst and necessary step in the collaborative process.   Th e second key challenge concerns the development of approaches to joint working that have the potential to  transform , rather than sim-ply  reaﬃ  rm , segmented ways of researching land–water problems. In its most reductive form, holistic thinking is confl ated with the idea of  multidisciplinarity : in essence, the provision of a sequence of distinct, neatly bounded disciplinary perspectives around a given research prob-lem (Tress and Tress  2001 ). According to this logic, communities of research fi nd common cause in a particular aspect of land–water systems Structural trendsCultural and, economic drivers of changeInstitutional complexitiesTerritorial and sectoral jurisdictions and institutional arrangementsCapacities to actAttitudes, responsibilities, knowledge and capitalPathways to Collaborative GovernanceUnderstanding context, defining problems, shaping visions and directions…..Politics of land-water management  Fig. 2.2    The thematic scope of social science research in IWAM        2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 49 (diff use  pollution, fl ood risk, or drought, for example), but since priori-ties are shaped by diff erent kinds of issue, standard disciplinary pathways to knowledge remain largely intact. In eff ect, the research problem is itself divided up according to the particular theoretical, methodological, and empirical perspectives favoured by the participating disciplines. It is almost inevitable that such an approach will lead to answers that are specifi c to the diff erent elements under study and that understanding the research problem as a whole can remain elusive. As such, the idea of a holistic, transdisciplinary or even post-disciplinary approach to land–water systems remains at best a distant aspiration of the research process, and at worse, a cover for a ‘business as usual’ discipline-bound approach to problem-framing and investigation. Despite a stronger emphasis on the need for interdisciplinary research agendas, and the incorporation of non-academic expertise, it is still the case that universities and research councils in general continue to assess the quality of academic work in terms of relevance to single disciplines. Th is is a major disincentive for the kind of innovation and collaborative working that is required to develop and deliver integrated strategies for water and agriculture.  One unfortunate consequence for IWAM of simplistic  interdisciplin-ary  thinking is that it tends to reinforce certain caricatures of what the social and natural sciences are perceived to do, and leads to deeply prob-lematic and unrefl exive views of the power we should (or should not) then invest in social and natural science judgement. In a disciplinary world, it is not unusual, for instance, for social scientists to be deroga-tively consigned to a rather nebulous world of conjecture and interpreta-tion, the implication being that, not only do they have little meaningful eff ect on material processes and outcomes, but they also engage in a kind of obfuscatory relativism that serves to stall expedient forms of action. Accordingly, abstracted from the messy social relations and politics of the human world, the natural sciences can duly carry on with the business of ‘evidence gathering’, revealing the deeper ‘objective’ truths behind appro-priate policy action.  In contrast, ideas of  interdisciplinarity  and  transdisciplinarity  off er more expansive and proactive interpretations of holistic working. In the former case, models of working proceed and carry with them an underlying aspi-ration for synthesis (Fish et al.  2008 ). Problems are defi ned  collaboratively 50 R.D. Fish et al.from the outset of research, while methodological frameworks are designed to synthesise fi ndings at strategic points in the research process. Transdisciplinarity working, in turn, implies progression to a vision of holistic research involving, as Harvey ( 2006 : 332) has put it in the context of rural economy and land use, ‘unifi cation of the involved disciplines at the paradigmatic (metaphysical) level’. In these circumstances, common vocabularies of problem-framing may begin to emerge among ostensibly diff erent kinds of land–water researchers, methodological pathways to knowledge associated with one disciplinary area begin to fi nd expression and application in others—often transforming them in the process—while underlying assumptions concerning the basis of disciplinary authority begin to dissipate. Importantly, a common characteristic of transdiscipli-narity is its tendency to collapse neat distinctions between scholarly and non-scholarly communities of expertise, a characteristic which resonates well with the ambitions, logic, and ethic of IWAM.  In the same way that IWAM governance cannot be treated as an additive processes in which two policy arenas are simply joined together, IWAM research demands a more sophisticated, collaborative, and beyond- disciplinary approach. At the present time, most IWAM research appears to be characterised by either single discipline or multidisciplinary work within the natural or social sciences. Research which seeks to transcend the conventional natural/social divide in land and water research is a very recent development which requires a signifi cant ‘upfront’ investment of time and trust in order to develop common defi nitions, conceptual models, methods, and working languages (Bracken and Oughton  2006 ). However, scale dependencies, system interactions and adaptations, risk, and uncertainty are all concepts which are recognised and have currency in the natural and social sciences and therefore have great potential as the basis of a common language for transdisciplinary IWAM research.      Conclusions: Moving IWAM Forward  IWAM has emerged as a new policy agenda from a variety of diff erent debates about rural resource management, including diff use and point- source pollution, fl ood risk, water conservation, drought management, and2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 51sustainable farming and food systems. While a broad range of policy fi elds and research disciplines related to land and water have switched on to the idea of joined-up ways of working, the underpinning concept of  inte-gration  is used in a variety of ways and has not received suffi  cient careful consideration. Indeed, much of the debate about IWAM to date has been concerned with the scientifi c, technical, and economic dimensions of land and water. While such debates are necessary for the development of eff ec-tive policy tools and instruments, other fundamental and equally impor-tant questions related to the integration of policymaking for agriculture and water, and the role of science in that process, demand much closer research attention.  IWAM is not just about the connection of two very diff erent policy areas (agriculture and water) at a single (catchment) scale. Both agricul-ture and water management are complex multilayered socio-biophysical systems, and neither are neatly delineated nor organised to fi t hydrologic boundaries defi ned solely by river catchment areas or river basins. As a consequence, a superfi cial ‘additive’ approach to integration is not viable for IWAM because it fails to take adequate account of the complex, mul-tidimensional, and uncertain nature of the systems which policymak-ers and researchers are attempting to merge. To use a simply analogy, the integration of agriculture and water management is not like a jigsaw puzzle with a relatively small number of large pieces which simply have to be put together in the right order to create a complete picture. Rather, it is more like a puzzle in which the sizes and shapes of a large number of pieces are constantly changing, producing diff erent patterns and confi gu-rations over time. Clearly, this sort of task requires a much more sophis-ticated and creative approach to both policy and research.  In a policy environment characterised by complex, evolving systems and interactions, pervasive uncertainty, and contested knowledge claims, the diffi  cult task of jointly managing water and agriculture cannot be achieved by government departments or public agencies acting in iso-lation, no matter how large or powerful they might be. Clearly, such organisations have legal responsibilities for land and water and are likely to play key roles, but the IWAM policy process itself must be based on a new system of multiparty and multilevel governance that not only oper-ates within catchments but is also linked to higher and lower levels of 52 R.D. Fish et al.governance and private decision-making. Collaborative governance, we contend, provides the kind of response repertoire that is required to begin coping more eff ectively with complexity and uncertainty, to realign agri-culture and water in the context of rural space, and to achieve the ambi-tious policy goals of IWAM. One of the implications is that those who are involved in the development and application of IWAM policy need a clear understanding of the diff erent phases in a collaborative process; the kinds of organisational, management, and research skills that it demands; the potential pitfalls and recovery strategies; and the kinds of outputs which can be expected to lead to positive outcomes in the long term.  Th e IWAM agenda also has major implications for the ways in which research on agriculture and water is practised. Future IWAM research needs to be transdisciplinary and synthetic, rather than simply multidis-ciplinary and additive, if it is to yield worthwhile knowledge regarding systemic interactions across multiple scales. As such, a common language is required to enable researchers from very diff erent disciplinary back-grounds in the natural and social sciences to understand each other in order to develop shared problem defi nitions and make use of combined methodologies. Concepts such as ‘complexity’, ‘interdependence’, and ‘uncertainty’ could provide very useful starting points. Such terms might have diff erent meanings to diff erent research communities, but neverthe-less provide some common ground for the development of a dialogue about how IWAM can be understood and further developed.  One of the potential dangers in advocating both collaborative gover-nance and transdisciplinary research for IWAM is that the two activities become distanced from one another when in fact what is needed is an arrangement whereby policy and research are mutually reinforcing. Once again, notions such as ‘complexity’ and ‘uncertainty’ are readily recognised by both the policy and research communities and could provide the nec-essary bridges between them. In particular, approaches such as Adaptive Environmental Management (AEM) have been specifi cally designed to combine policymaking and research in highly complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments (Holling  1978 ; McLain and Lee  1996 ). Th e underlying principle of AEM is that policies inevitably have to be designed on the basis of incomplete scientifi c understanding, and there-fore should be treated as trial-and-error experiments which are adapted 2 Water Governance and Agricultural Management 53over time on the basis of feedback from scientifi c monitoring and evalu-ation. In eff ect, AEM brings together policymakers and researchers in a collaborative governance environment where complexity and uncertainty are openly acknowledged and addressed. Given the nature of the scientifi c and policy challenges associated with the integration of agriculture and water management, it is precisely this sort of proactive, experimental, and collaborative approach that needs to be developed for the future.  At the present time, IWAM represents a long-term goal or aspiration that has yet to be fully translated into an operational strategy for dealing with water and agriculture in a holistic or interconnected fashion. Any future strategy must be capable of maintaining food production systems without compromising the long-term viability of water and ecological systems. In addressing agriculture and water in a combined way, IWAM must include a range of stakeholders who are unlikely to have interacted closely with each other in the past. As such, IWAM requires particular eff ort in developing mutual understanding, negotiation, and cooperation so that political, organisational, and disciplinary diff erences and confl ict-ing interests can be overcome. Ultimately, success will depend on the development of transparent and legitimate channels of dialogue and col-laboration that connect the local, catchment, national, and international scales of governance and research on agriculture and water.

However, the actual dynamics of the Mediterranean agri-food system reveal a much more complex and diverse reality, with distinct socionatural confi gurations—from highly intensive vegetable production to extensive cereal farms—which do not fi t the stereotype and are seldom analysed in an integrated fashion (see Ortiz-Miranda et al.  2013 ). Not only are these historical socio-ecological systems being bypassed, but Mediterranean dynamics have struggled to fi t into European agrarian change and rural development paradigms developed in the Anglo-Saxon tradition (which         A.   Moragues-Faus      ((cid:13))   Cardiff  University ,   Cardiff  ,  UK     are the main infl uence behind European Union  policies). Th is diffi  culty has prompted an image of ‘delay’ in Mediterranean countries, either in adopting productivist pathways (e.g. increasing the size of agricultural holdings) or in developing an internal market for organic products or urban food policies.  In this chapter, I want to discuss how the European food studies scholarship has bypassed distinct political ecologies, and propose new ways to integrate the diverse socionatural confi gurations that con-stitute current European agri-food systems. For this purpose, fi rst, I introduce political ecology (PE) as a critical tool that combines ele-ments of ecological and political economy and its usefulness to study agri-food systems. Second, I present a sequence of theoretical debates on agrarian change, rural development, and associated criticisms, ranging from more classical conceptualizations—such as the mod-ernization paradigm—to more recent theoretical formulations such as the bio- and eco-economy models. Th is analysis is followed by an account of how PE as well as the Mediterranean academia can con-tribute to developing a more comprehensive and critical approach to understanding European agrarian change dynamics in order to ulti-mately inform more inclusive rural development policies and proj-ects. Th e third section presents the emergence of urban food strategies (UFS) and uses PE coordinates to point out challenges in urban food policies in the pursuit of more sustainable and just food futures as well as discuss Mediterranean specifi cities. Finally, the conclusions high-light some of the main elements to develop a PE of Mediterranean  agri-food systems.      Political Ecology: A Critical Community of Practice Striving for New Spaces of Possibility  Th e term ‘political ecology’ embraces a range of defi nitions, dating back to the 1970s, to explain environmental degradation as a consequence of corporate and state mismanagement (Cockburn and Ridgeway  1979 ). Th is term emerges in part as a challenge to apolitical accounts of 60 A. Moragues-Faus environmental crisis and ecological change that ignore the infl uence of political- economic forces, and calls for an explicit unveiling of normative goals that embed assumptions and explanations around human–nature relations (Robbins  2012 ). Following Bryant and Bailey ( 1997 ), the basic premise of PE research is that ecological conditions and their modifi ca-tions are the result of a political process. Th is assumption can be further divided into three key elements: costs and benefi ts derived from eco-system management and environmental changes are unequally distrib-uted, how this distribution can reinforce or reduce existing social and economic inequalities, and how this in turn alters power relations among actors (Bryant and Bailey  1997 ).  PE research links processes occurring on diff erent scales—from the individual actions of peasants selecting seeds to multilateral trade agree-ments—integrating diff erent levels of decision-making to reveal winners and losers, costs and benefi ts, and their implications in power distribu-tion. PE not only jumps between scales, but also combines diff erent disciplines, or as Bryant and Bailey ( 1997 ) put it, disciplinary transgres-sions. Th is has led to a very fertile fi eld, undeniably characterized by an enormous theoretical and empirical heterogeneity, under the banner of PE, which inevitably also challenges the fi eld’s coherence (Blaikie  2008 ). Furthermore, Robbins ( 2012 ) suggests that PE cannot be encapsulated as a method or a theory—since it mobilizes concepts from broader schools of thought, rather, he proposes we describe PE as a community of prac-tice that fosters a global conversation between academics and practitio-ners. Following Robbins ( 2012 ), the PE studies are characterized by the following four main elements:•     Track winners and losers : Environmental changes, by and large, have unequal consequences for diff erent communities or groups. PE narra-tives explore the historical process through which winners and losers of environmental transformations are created, including the institutional, social, economic, and power relations that operate on diff erent scales and even geographies. One example is the use of pesticides in farming, which, as Galt ( 2008 ) shows, is infl uenced by a mixture of socio- economic characteristics of the farm household, political-economy relations in the food chain, and agro-ecological relations. Th e global 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 61governance of food export and pesticide regulation puts producers in the developing farming countries and their domestic market at a higher health risk than northern consumers (Galt  2009 ). However, winners and losers are not only restricted to individuals or communi-ties. Non-humans, that is, the environment itself, can also suff er injus-tices. Th e recent book  Th e Political Ecology of Meat  (Emel and Neo  2015 ) analyses the root of socio-economic marginalization in political- economic institutions of animals that are converted into meat by look-ing at how power structures and knowledge of the global meat trade are reproduced, as well as the socionatural implications of meat pro-duction and consumption.  •    Narrate using human–non-human dialectics : From a dialectical posi-tion, things are not discrete but interrelated; they have a history and an external connection with other things; they are in constant interaction and transformation, that is, in a state of ongoing becoming. Th e dia-lectical approach in PE leads to understanding how things and rela-tions change by becoming entangled with one another, rather than how individual variables can explain phenomena in a straightforward way. For example, Goodman (2004) explores the dialectical relation-ship between the material aspects of fair trade and the meaningful constructions of ethical products. Th is dialectical relationship between materiality and meaning unveils limitations of fair trade networks, including the potential to exclude most vulnerable producers who can-not comply with quality standards from reaching outlets for middle- class knowledgeable northern consumers (Ortiz-Miranda and Moragues-Faus  2014 ).  •    Start from or end in contradiction : Robbins also highlights that many PE texts start their enquiry from or end their analysis in a socio- ecological contradiction, which fosters critical scrutiny of taken-for- granted approaches or ideas. One example is Guthman’s ( 2004 ) analysis of organic agriculture in the USA, which reveals that rather than creating fairer, more sustainable, and intercon-nected food systems, the organic ideology contributes to capitalist development and labour exploitation. By exposing these paradoxes, PE contributes to the understanding of unjust and unsustainable socionatural mechanisms.  62 A. Moragues-Faus•    Simultaneously make claims about the state of nature   and claims about claims about the state of nature : PE aims to understand environmental change; on the one hand describing transformations in the physical world (e.g. development of genetically modifi ed organisms [GMOs]), while on the other, the meanings and discourses attached, representing and shaping those changes (e.g. supporters of GMOs vs. anti-GMOs). Th is tension is also linked to diff erent epistemological positions; realist in the fi rst case and constructivist in the second. However, this juxta-position can be extremely fertile in understanding the ecological and political process that ultimately leads to specifi c socionatural confi gu-rations. Th e case of GMOs is particularly interesting since there are biophysical processes involved at the same time as a contentious debate on knowledge creation and the politics of science, which ultimately constitute a key element in the discussion and regulatory outcomes (Lawhon and Murphy  2012 ).     Finally, it is important to mention the long tradition of PE as a critique of wider environmental management and natural resources use and allo-cation, which exposes the crucial role of power relations in shaping socio-natural relations that reproduce inequality and injustice. Nonetheless, as Walker ( 2006 ) states, critique is not suffi  cient; political ecologists should also engage in envisioning and nurturing more sustainable and just futures, creating the grounds for new spaces of possibility to emerge (Cornwell  2012 ; Gibson-Graham  2006 ).      Revisiting Agrarian Change and Rural Development Paradigms Under a Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems  Th is section presents a short overview of the rural development and agrarian change paradigms that have dominated debates in the European context. Th is critical review points out how these dominant European approaches have surpassed Mediterranean PEs and how the integration of socionatural sensibilities and histories as well as a better focus on power relations could enrich these conceptualizations. 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 63    Modernization or Marginalization: Intensify, Get Larger, or Get Out  Th e study of rural and agricultural change has been characterized by a long series of exchanges, in many cases between ‘competing paradigms’ that have led to conceptual transitions. From the 1950s until the late 1980s, agricultural restructuring and science was pervaded by a produc-tivist ethos. Th is productivist regime expanded through most developed countries, defi ned as process of farm modernization aiming to increase food production through ‘intensive, industrially driven and expansionist agriculture with state support based primarily on output and increased productivity’ (Lowe et al.  1993 : 221). According to Friedmann and McMichael ( 1989 ), this period responds to the productivism agricultural regime or intensive food regime, and was fuelled by a devastated Europe after the Second World War when diff erent mechanisms were set up to foster domestic food production in order to assure food security (Lowe et al.  1993 ; Marsden et al.  1993 ). Th ese circumstances coincided with what has been conceptualized as a Fordist mode of regulation, where state intervention in the agricultural sector was conceived as part of a larger social contract between capital and labour (Potter and Tilzey  2005 ). Th erefore, in areas where agriculture was unable to intensify or use econ-omies of scale in order to respond to the agrarian cost-price squeeze (by enlarging holdings, increasing inputs and technology, etc.), farms became increasingly dependent on state support, and were also pushed to aban-don commercial agriculture if they were not able to compete under the productivist rationale (Marsden et al.  1993 ; Van der Ploeg and Renting  2000 ). Th e productivist paradigm’s message was also delivered through policy instruments such as subsidies telling farmers to intensify,  get larger ,  or get out  (Lang  1999 ). Th e productivist regime was further reinforced by the role of agricultural economists in shaping  scientiﬁ c spheres  and mainly analysing rural areas and agrarian change through the lens of moderniza-tion (Newby  1982 ).  In the mid-1980s, there was a political crisis within the productiv-ist paradigm, related to the increase of production and its associated budgetary policy problems in the European Union, a rise of public health and environmental concerns associated with intensive agriculture 64 A. Moragues-Faus(e.g. bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE]), and international mar-ket tensions due to state intervention (Lowe et al.  1990 ; Patterson  1997 ). Furthermore, Potter and Tilzey ( 2005 ) also identify a transition in this period from a Fordist mode of regulation to the progressive incorpo-ration of corporativist interests in the design of policies, confi guring a new phase of corporativist political productivism. Signifi cant mismatches between actual agricultural dynamics and the interpretation of agrarian problems and solutions through a productivist lens fostered changes in academic and political spheres, since the ‘modernize or disappear’ mes-sage inherent to the productivist paradigm was obscuring a much more complex farming reality.  Some examples of this diversity and complexity came from the Mediterranean. For instance, Fabiani and Scarano ( 1995 ) argued, based on census data from 1990, that there was a more complex structure in Italian agriculture, which would be better explained by a continuum rather than a polarization of extremes. According to these authors, this agricultural holding diff erentiation would respond to the plurality of functions performed by diverse types of farms (i.e. residential function, disengagement for retiring farms, income complement under several forms of pluriactivity), including an adaptation of agriculture to the broader Italian diversifi ed model of territorial development. Greece also provides an interesting example, given its ‘problematic’ agricul-tural structure under the lens of modernization, characterized by a marked territorial duality between  littoral and plain agriculture, and farming on mountains and islands. Greek academics (e.g. Beopoulos and Damianakos  1997 ; Damianakos  1997 ) call for a more pluralistic understanding of farming strategies, including the coexistence in the same holding of distinct relations of production, the increase of plu-riactivity of farm families, the importance of social bonds (i.e. family, relatives), and the role of rural–urban linkages. Th erefore, the multiple transformation processes of Greek agriculture included the preservation of some specifi c features intimately conditioned by its social structure and territorial context that made it diffi  cult to comply with simplistic modernization ideals.  Th ese contributions, only briefl y reviewed here, show the need for a more place-based, critical, and historical approach to understanding 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 65agrarian change dynamics, focusing on socionatural relations in order to understand farmers’ strategies and landscape changes. However, a close relative of PE, political economy, took centre stage in the study of agrar-ian change throughout the 1990s, emphasizing the importance of state and policies, and macroeconomic factors of decision-making processes and focusing on food production and global market regimes (Marsden et al.  1993 ; Wilson  2001 ).      Productivism Versus Post-productivism  Despite its non-agricultural origins (Tovey  2001 ), post-productivism became a key term in the agrarian domain since its emergence in the 1990s as an attempt to capture the crisis in agrarian policies and the incorporation of wider health, environmental, and rural development concerns into the agricultural agenda (Walford  2003 ; Ward  1993 ). Th is term also aimed to capture the cost-price squeeze faced by farm-ers as a result of modernization and the overall productivist model (Evans et al.  2002 ). Th ese concerns were manifested in new rules and regulations in the agricultural sector, what Marsden et al. ( 2001 ) called a bureaucratic hygienic mode of regulation, referring to the constraint of traditional and ecological practices by new health and safety norms that ultimately constituted a barrier for small produc-ers to access markets. An important part of environmental regulation in particular conceives nature as a  consumable good to be enjoyed by urban dwellers, while agriculture is seen as a ‘dirty business’ that needs to be monitored (Marsden  2003 ).  Th e productivist/post-productivist debate (already briefl y discussed in Chap.   1    ) gathered attention in academic and political spheres in Europe and particularly the UK. Th e emergence of post-productivism as a term to explain new agrarian dynamics led to redefi ne productivism as the opposite to post-productivism; that is to say, if productivism was char-acterized by intensifi cation, specialization, and concentration, post-pro-ductivism was defi ned by extensifi cation, dispersion, and diversifi cation (Ilbery and Bowler  1998 ). Th is dualism sparked a heated debate not only on the actual reach of the phenomenon but also on the usefulness 66 A. Moragues-Fausof the concept itself. Th is included new empirical evidence on the vital-ity of productivism practices in the European countryside together with a  limited spread of post-productivist activities. For example, Walford ( 2003 ) demonstrates an increasing share of agricultural production pro-vided by large farms and a continued adoption of mechanization and automation processes in the UK agricultural sector. Several studies also showed that changes derived from the participation in agri-environmen-tal schemes, quality production, or organic agriculture did not imply a major change in farmers’ practices and behaviours; in fact, in many cases, the participation in these initiatives involved using productivist practices (Evans et al.  2002 ).  As before, this evidence demonstrated the coexistence of diff erent farm pathways within the European countryside (Walford  2003 ), as well as the need to incorporate agency, actor-oriented, and behavioural analysis in post-productivist studies in order to tackle grass-roots dynamics. Another fallacy of the productivism and post-produc-tivism conceptualization is its UK-centrism, and the failure to dis-cuss whether the concept has wider applicability within Europe and beyond (Wilson  2001 ). Mediterranean dynamics in particular have been mostly ignored in this debate by British and Northern European scholars. For instance, Hoggart and Paniagua challenged the actual extent and depth of changes occurring in the so-called post-productiv-ist British countryside, calling for a more critical and stronger theoreti-cal evaluation of rural change (Hoggart and Paniagua  2001a ). In their analysis, they also tackled the Spanish case (Hoggart and Paniagua  2001b ), not fi nding any signs of diversifi cation, professionalization, or environmentalism in the agrarian sector, which led them to deny any sign of post-productivism as well as reinforce their critique to this approach.  In fact, the post-productivist/productivist question is a clear example of an over-celebratory analysis of a specifi c type of agrarian dynamics. A more critical approach, able to unveil the power relations that confi gure specifi c socionatural spaces, would have been instrumental to a better understanding of the diff erent PEs emerging in a society where quality and environmental values were highly valued but operating in a wider productivist regime.  3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 67    Beyond Dualisms: Multifunctionality and the New Rural Development Paradigm  Th is dualistic debate between productivism and post-productivism was interrupted by the formulation of a third paradigm, strongly linked to the rise of multifunctionality as a conceptual, practical, and political device (Marsden et al.  2001 ; Van der Ploeg et al.  2000 ). Breaking the deadlock, Marsden ( 2003 ) identifi ed three distinct models shaping changes in rural areas and agriculture. Th ese models constituted expressions of specifi c socio-economic dynamics and involved political and scientifi c concep-tualizations where the relationship between society and nature is a defi n-ing element. Th e fi rst of these three models is the  agro-industrial model , strongly linked to the productivist agricultural regime described above and therefore underpinned by modernization theory, in which intensifi -cation and economies of scale in agriculture constitute the development pathway. Second, the  post-productivist model  includes aspects related to the  countryside consumption model  or the  bureaucratic hygienic model  (Marsden et al.  2001 ). According to Marsden ( 2003 ), this model does not imply a break with the agro-industrial dynamics, but rather a con-tinuity and attempt to correct some perceived defi ciencies. As the same author recently put it, this model implied a compromise ‘ whereby envi-ronmental protection ,  amenity pressures ,  as well as food production demands on agricultural land could be assuaged by increasingly cheap imports of both temperate and exotic foodstuﬀ s ’ (Marsden  2012 : 1). And fi nally, there is the  new rural development model , defi ned as a real shift from previous dynamics where farmers squeezed by low revenues mobilize new sources of income to set up diff erent rural development practices in order to maintain farming activity, and thus constitute multifunctional livelihood strategies (Kinsella et al.  2000 ; Van der Ploeg et al.  2000 ).  Th is new rural development model was mainly based on a new agri-cultural model that drew on the multifunctionality of agriculture. Th e concept of multifunctionality emerged earlier (in 1993) in the European Council for Agriculture. Its aim was to harmonize European legislation and ground the notion of sustainable agriculture (Marsden and Sonnino  2008 ). Other authors point out that this was a social welfare justifi cation for state assistance through the Common Agricultural Policy (Potter and 68 A. Moragues-FausTilzey  2005 ). Th e multifunctionality of agriculture has received much attention from academics and policymakers, mostly in the European context and related with the political construct of the European model of agriculture, despite its contested nature (Buller  2001 ). In fact, assump-tions such as ‘all agriculture is multifunctional’ have raised the need to clarify debates through more complex conceptualizations such as the distinction between weak and strong multifunctionality (Wilson  2007 ,  2008 ) or to distinguish how diff erent rural/agrarian development models use the concept of multifunctionality (Marsden and Sonnino  2008 ).  Th is new rural development model included diff erent farming strate-gies that were grouped into three processes: deepening, broadening, and re-grounding (Van der Ploeg and Roep  2003 ). Th is framework led to a rethinking of diversifi cation and pluriactivity phenomena, from marginal-ized practices to key strategies to build up new consumption– production relationships and how this benefi ted rural communities (Kinsella et al.  2000 ; Ventura and Milone  2000 ). Th e new approach reveals a conceptual paradox, showing that specifi c processes conceived as ‘backwards’ under a productivist lens are actually supporting long-term farmers’ livelihoods as well as generating positive environmental externalities and contribut-ing to the social fabric (Moragues-Faus  2014 ). Th is new multifunctional approach fuelled an important body of work on how these three pro-cesses unfold in diff erent European countries (Van der Ploeg and Renting  2000 ). In particular, the study of deepening processes, mostly in the form of establishing short food supply chains and constructing quality food products, has gained broad recognition. In fact, research on short food supply chains and/or alternative food networks has developed into a very prolifi c area of study (see recent reviews by Goodman et al.  2012 ; Tregear  2011 ). Some authors state that this model may owe its origins to those regions that other development logics have largely ‘bypassed’ (Marsden  2003 ), areas that traditionally were termed ‘peripheral rural regions’ and thought of as lagging behind. Mediterranean agricultural landscapes in particular have been considered an example for some of these processes based on producing high-quality foodstuff s and diversifi ed incomes.  Despite the broad acceptance of this new model in academic spheres, many of these contributions have received criticism from diff erent fronts. Conceptually, several authors point out the benign view and 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 69normative assumptions underlying some of the formulations of this new paradigm, being ‘aligned with an idealised vision of a rural Europe of resourceful yeoman farmers and the era of high farming’ (Goodman 2004: 8) .  Goodman (2004) also acknowledges an insuffi  ciently devel-oped method to assess the impact of these new rural development prac-tices, in particular the incorporation of elements such as equity and power distribution that resonate in the PE agenda. Several authors are concerned about the lack of critical analysis of some food initiatives; for example, assuming that organic is good when the labour conditions of the farmers are not assessed, or that local is good when it might be repro-ducing relations of domination (Allen and Guthman  2006 ; DuPuis and Goodman  2005 ; Guthman  2008 ; Sayer  2001 ). Furthermore, many of the empirical studies underpinning these theoretical contributions have generally focused on individual niche initiatives, such as the develop-ment of quality products, agri-tourism, or pluriactivity farms that stand out for their exemplifying nature rather than demonstrating a wide dissemination of these practices. Th e attempt to measure the spread and impact of initiatives under the new rural development paradigm throughout Europe using statistical data (Van der Ploeg and Roep  2003 ) resulted in using proxies to measure the spread of this model such as the number of farmers involved in protected designations of origin (PDOs), which might occlude dynamics operating under pro-ductivist or post-productivist logics.  However, these processes and initiatives in many cases combine char-acteristics of diff erent models, creating hybrid practices (Sonnino and Marsden  2006 ). For example, some Italian farmers merge industrial and artisanal modes of production under PDOs (Trabalzi  2007 ) or the case of Greece, where there is a lack of farming-based activities on agri-tourism initiatives (Kizos and Iosifi des  2007 ). Another example is plu-riactivity, an old strategy that has been relabelled under this paradigm. Pluriactive farmers might operate under productivism logic—developing non- agricultural tasks as a transition to abandoning agriculture—or these practices could be an innovative response to maintaining agricultural pro-duction, expressing hybridity and continuity of some processes. As a con-sequence, critics have disputed this paradigm as a new phenomenon—as they did with post-productivism conceptualizations (Goodman 2004).  70 A. Moragues-Faus    New Concepts or Old Dualisms?  Th e debate on rural development and agrarian change has recently been embedded in wider debates about the sustainability of the food system and food security, reconnecting food production and consumption spheres (Sonnino et al.  2014 ). Th e expansion of the topic is inevitably related to what has been labelled as the ‘new food equation’ (Morgan and Sonnino  2010 ), characterized by the increase of food insecurity, including hunger, as well as diet-related diseases; the recognition of food security as a national security issue; the eff ect of climate change in agro- food systems and vice versa; and the growing incidence of land confl icts around the globe. Th ese processes are accompanied by the recognition of the multifunctional character of food by diff erent stakeholders, from policymakers to civil society organizations, and therefore its strategic value in resolving a range of problems, from environmental impacts to public health costs (Morgan and Sonnino  2010 ). Th ese new dynamics have inevitably fuelled new and more profound debates about the role agriculture plays in contemporary society, considering not only produc-tivity but also how to ‘optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption’ (Pretty et al.  2010 : 220).  Nevertheless, despite the complexity that characterizes the current situation, most practical and political solutions, as well as theoretical  contributions, have revolved around two opposite narratives that repro-duce the old dichotomies discussed above. Th ese narratives have been given diff erent labels such as the productivity (or effi  ciency) and suffi  -ciency narratives (Freibauer et al.  2011 ; Huber  2000 ), the productivist and demand-led approaches (Sonnino et al.  2014 ), or the bioeconomy and eco-economy paradigms (Kitchen and Marsden  2009 ). Th is last case is particularly instrumental in exploring the reproduction of old dichotomies. Horlings and Marsden ( 2011 ) use the concept of ecological modernization as an overarching theoretical concept underpinning both narratives and models: the bioeconomy and the eco-economy. Ecological modernization involves a positive framing of the relationship between ecology, society, and economic development, involving ‘ a gradual re-embedding of ecology in the institutions of economy ,  creating the spaces for an 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 71ecological as well as economic rationality ’ (Marsden  2004 : 3). In a similar way to the conceptual development of multifunctionality and sustainabil-ity, there has been a distinction between the weak and the strong strands of ecological modernization. Scholars relate weak ecological modernization to a corporativist interpretation based on the economization of nature through elitist decision-making structures. Meanwhile, strong ecological modernization relates to changes towards sustainable production and con-sumption patterns through further democratization, redistribution, and consideration of social justice issues (Gibbs  2000 ; Hajer  1996 ).  Horlings et al. ( 2010 ) identify the bioeconomy and eco-economy par-adigms as examples of weak and strong ecological modernization, respec-tively. Th e bioeconomy paradigm refers to ‘those economic activities that capture latent value in biological processes and renewable bio-resources to produce improved health and sustainable growth and development’ (Horlings et al.  2010 : 7). Th e dominant narrative under the bioeconomy paradigm is a new politico-economic strategy operating globally to sus-tain capital accumulation through nature’s modifi cation and commoditi-zation at diff erent levels (Birch et al.  2010 ; Kitchen and Marsden  2011 ). Th is paradigm shares principles with the productivity or effi  ciency nar-rative as described above, which relies on scientifi c advances to face food insecurity and environmental challenges, mostly through technologies that boost productivity while addressing resource constraints and reduc-ing negative environmental impacts (Freibauer et al.  2011 ).  Contrastingly, the eco-economy paradigm is presented as an alterna-tive paradigm cutting across production and also consumption spheres. It is defi ned as a set of complex networks of viable economic activities that utilize the varied environmental resources in more sustainable ways, providing cumulative net benefi ts that add value to rural and regional spaces in both ecological and economic ways (Horlings and Marsden  2011 ; Kitchen and Marsden  2009 ). Unlike the previous paradigm, the eco- economy paradigm stresses place-based constructions of economic relations and, at the same time, emphasizes ‘the recalibration of micro-behaviour and practices that, added together, can potentially realign production-consumption chains and capture local and regional value between rural and urban spaces’ (Horlings et al.  2010 : 8). Th is model is clearly aligned with the suffi  ciency narrative, which envisages a response 72 A. Moragues-Fausto the new food equation through scientifi c advances applied to food production, mainly through behavioural and structural changes in food systems that transform current production and consumption practices (Freibauer et al.  2011 ).  Th is example of the eco-economy/bioeconomy paradigm shows that despite broadening the focus to the entire food system and the increasing type and number of participants in these debates, paradigms not only maintain the dualism and stagnation of former conceptualizations (see Marsden  2012  on diff erences [specifi cally Table 1]), but also tend to reproduce mainly their basic elements. In the case of the eco-economy paradigm, its defi ning characteristics and innovations proposed are, by and large, related to the processes of deepening, broadening, and re- grounding the sustainable rural development paradigm (see Kitchen and Marsden  2009  for an adaptation of the framework) and also closely linked to the diff erent dimensions identifi ed under the ‘rural web’ (Horlings and Marsden  2011 ; Marsden 2010). Similarly, the bioeconomy principles basically reproduce the logics of productivism, placing the increase of productivity as the main solution and overall aim of economic (and agri-cultural) development. Th is polarization once more leads to simplifi ca-tions of reality and also acts as a heuristic device (Tscharntke et al.  2012 ), since most farmers’ strategies lie somewhere between the extremes, as many contributions on agrarian change in Mediterranean countries show (e.g. Kizos and Iosifi des  2007 ; Moragues-Faus  2014 ).      Contributing to Rural/Agrarian Development Paradigms from a Political Ecology Perspective: Lessons from Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems  PE approaches, as well as the Mediterranean scholarship, can contrib-ute to developing a more comprehensive and critical approach to under-standing European agrarian change dynamics in order to inform more inclusive rural development discourses, projects, and policies. Below, I point out key elements to advance in this agenda related to key PE tools as described above and current agricultural dynamics in Mediterranean Europe (see compilation by Ortiz-Miranda et al.  2013 ). 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 73 First, it is paramount to  develop a critical approach in order to under-stand socionatural conﬁ gurations of agrarian change.  Th e literature shows a tension between understanding the dynamics of agrarian change and formulating a sustainable rural development model that will deliver eco-nomic, social, and environmental benefi ts across Europe. PE prompts us to develop a robust critique and understanding of the power relations at play that shape specifi c environmental and socio-economic confi gura-tions, as well as to understand who wins and who loses throughout these processes of change. European agri-food studies will benefi t from separat-ing this critical analysis of the state of the art from more normative views, which although necessary (see below), might obscure the dynamics at play. A clear example comes from Laurent’s ( 2013 ) magnifi cent explana-tion of how multifunctional agriculture discourses in France hide the appalling working conditions of the migrant workers who are essential to make these farms economically viable. Similarly, Arnalte-Alegre and Ortiz-Miranda ( 2013 ) reveal how the development of PDO labels has contributed to a further intensifi cation of agriculture. It is paramount to  make these paradoxes and contradictions visible  because they are key to shaping and transforming agri-food systems. Th is will also entail unpack-ing the idea of yeoman farmer, as Goodman (2004) puts it, to include immigrants, food-chain workers, women, part-time farmers, rich and poor consumers, and other relevant agents in the study of food systems.  Second, we need to acknowledge  place-based socio-natures as key agents  confi guring agri-food systems and rural spaces. By and large, in European circles, Mediterranean landscapes are envisaged as a set of small farms enclosed in HNV spaces producing high-quality food products that are recognized globally as part of the famous Mediterranean diet, which also constitutes an invaluable cultural asset. However, while this constructed image is true for some specifi c agro-ecosystems (e.g. mountain olive oil production) (Moragues-Faus and Sonnino  2012 ), it hides a much more complex and diverse set of processes in those ‘ideal landscapes’ such as the importance of pensions in keeping agriculture viable in some areas (Moragues-Faus  2014 ) or the increasing rate of land abandonment (Aldanondo Ochoa and Casanovas Oliva  2009 ), as well as failing to account for socio-ecological systems such as extensive grain monocultures or intensive organic vegetable production in greenhouses, for example, in 74 A. Moragues-FausAlmeria, the so-called sea of plastic ( mar de plástico ) (Galdeano-Gómez et al.  2011 ). Consequently, specifi c socionatural confi gurations and their evolution over time are key to understanding the agri-food system and acknowledging its territorial embeddedness and associated interdepen-dencies in social, cultural, environmental, and economic terms in order to formulate interventions towards more sustainable and just futures.  Curiously enough, despite the studies and data that challenge the wide-spread diversifi cation and other related activities in Mediterranean Europe (Arnalte-Alegre and Ortiz-Miranda  2013 ), the Mediterranean stereotype has been championed in rural development paradigms as an example of post-productivism, multifunctional agriculture, and/or rural development success. Th is contradiction shows not only the importance of developing empirically grounded studies, but also the need to be critical about  how not only  discourses but also theoretical contributions are built.  PE calls for a critical account of the production of knowledge , raising awareness of exist-ing interests and how knowledge can also constitute a tool for exclusion and domination (Forsyth  2003 ). For example, most paradigms on rural development and agrarian change have been developed (and inspired) in an Anglo-Saxon context (and language), from productivist and moderniza-tion approaches to the eco-economy. My contention, therefore, is not only about the need for integration of other perspectives and socio-ecological systems, but also the need to raise awareness that the framings attached to these paradigms are conditioning our views on particular agri-food sys-tems. Th is is clearly illustrated under the lens of modernization, where small family farms in the Mediterranean region were seen as backwards in the ‘development’ process. Th is notion of delay led to the design of agricul-tural and rural policies oriented towards reducing the structural gap with Northern European countries, that is, increasing the size of holdings to the detriment of other policy goals, namely environmental ones (Paniagua  2001 ). However, this also applies to the multifunctional approach that cel-ebrates the production of high- quality foodstuff s despite creating markets only for middle- or high-income families. Of course, these framings have misguided not only academics but also policymakers in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (Moragues-Faus et al.  2013 ).  Finally, developing place-based critical accounts of agricultural dynamics and the process of knowledge creation is a fi rst step towards 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 75c omprehending current processes. However, the  PE community of practice is committed to understanding the world in order to change it . In this regard, unveiling the relations of production behind particular foodstuff s is not enough; it is important to engage in new inclusive conversations that cre-ate spaces of possibility for new socionatural confi gurations. Th ese spaces should take into account the production and reproduction of inequali-ties between people and places, and aim to formulate rural development models that challenge these inequalities.       Reframing Urban Food Strategies to Build More Inclusive Critical Food Geographies  Cities are beginning to rise in the Global North and the Global South as key food policy actors are expanding food studies from their sole focus on agriculture and rural development to embrace consumption and urban areas. In the last decade, there has been a growing number of contribu-tions under the banner of urban food or food planning (e.g. International Planning Studies Special issue 2009; Maxwell  1999 ; Pothukuchi and Kaufman  1999 ; Viljoen and Wiskerke  2012 ). Th is broadening in focus calls for spatial and food-chain integration as well as a holistic approach to sustainability, including the environment, health, economics, social jus-tice, quality, pleasure, culture, and so on. Th is section explores the emer-gence of UFS in the Global North, refl ecting and presenting results from my participation in the community of practice on UFS of the European project FOODLINKS (Moragues-Faus et al.  2013 ). PE coordinates are instrumental in pointing out challenges faced by UFS when building more sustainable and just food futures, and discussing Mediterranean specifi cities.     Urban Food Strategies: Connecting Scales and Sectors  More than 70 % of Europeans live in urban areas, a number that is likely to increase in the forthcoming years (UNFPA  2008 ). Recent food cri-ses, particularly the food price hikes of 2007–2008, have shown the 76 A. Moragues-Faus vulnerabilities of the food system, exposing the socio-economic and  environmental defi ciencies of an unsustainable food system. For example, FAO ( 2009 ) reports that around 43 million people are at risk of food pov-erty in Europe, while obesity and other diet-related diseases are on the rise, generating economic costs of more than $560 billion in the USA (Kenkel and Manning  1999 ). Environmental impacts of the food system are also staggering, with food system emissions contributing to 19–29 % of global greenhouse gas emissions (Vermeulen et al.  2012 ) and food waste per capita reaching around 100 kg per year in Europe (FAO  2013 ). Food con-stitutes a vehicle to integrate these social, economic, and environmental concerns, as well as to reconnect diff erent geographies, sectors, and scales.  Th e local or city context is gaining recognition as a political sphere where municipal action is sometimes more feasible than broader changes to national or international policies (Moragues-Faus and Morgan  2015 ). Food planning, for instance, is a clear example of how cities can pro-vide more space for growing food, develop new food markets, or limit fast food outlets near schools (see more examples in Moragues-Faus et al.  2013 ). Furthermore, the challenges and potential solutions that cities face are mediated by the historical confi guration of specifi c socio- ecological relations that shape each urban space. Consequently, UFS take diff erent forms around the globe. For example, London as a capital city needs to acknowledge the cultural richness of its food system and deliver good food for this diverse population accordingly. In the case of Malmö in Sweden, the industrial past of the city constrains the development of organic agriculture in some areas, or requires innovative solutions in order to develop urban food-growing projects. Nevertheless, the aware-ness of the local context should not prevent cities from cooperating with diff erent scales and territories, allowing a trans-local movement to emerge (Moragues-Faus and Morgan  2015 ).  Transforming the food system also requires a holistic vision that inte-grates both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Th e vertical dimension of the food system includes all the activities involved in the food chain: pro-duction, transformation, transport, distribution, storage, consumption, waste management, and recycling. Th e horizontal dimension refers to all areas that shape or are shaped by our food system: well-being, health, social justice, economic development, education, environment, and so 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 77on. Finally, this holistic system calls for an integration of the diff erent actors that play a role in the food system, by incorporating voices from civil society organizations, local administration, public institutions, and other private and public stakeholders that operate in the food chain, such as producers, businesses, markets, distribution companies, restaurants, caterers, schools, and so on. A good starting point from which to identify these dimensions and actors is a food audit, as conducted by Bristol Food Council in 2011, entitled  Who Feeds Bristol  (more information in Carey  2013 ), which revealed the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges that this UK city faces to transform its food system. For example, the report shows the loss of fertile soil around the city, the decrease in the number of inde-pendent shops that sell fresh fruit and vegetables in favour of supermar-kets, and the diffi  culties faced by the wholesale market that constitutes a key piece of infrastructure in the local food system.  Developing a place-based diagnosis helps to identify key areas of inter-vention. After an analysis of diff erent UFS in the community of practice of the FOODLINKS project, we identifi ed seven thematic fi elds where food can have an impact in cities (Moragues-Faus et al.  2013 ):•    Improving  health and well-being  through good, nutritious, and healthy food adapted to local and traditional diets.  •   Improving  environmental c onditions, for example, reducing CO 2  emis-sions, being more energy effi  cient, reducing food miles, promoting organic and agro-ecological production, and preserving green and agricultural spaces.  •   Enhancing  economic and community development  based on a vibrant local and green economy, for example, by supporting local growers, retailers, and markets; improving local infrastructure; and generating employment opportunities.  •   Preserving  social and cultural  assets by supporting resilient, close-knit communities and food-friendly neighbourhoods, for example, by cel-ebrating and promoting local food culture and by creating collective spaces such as buying groups, collective kitchens, or public food banks.  •   Focussing on  food security and social justice , improving access to aff ord-able, healthy, and culturally diverse food, as well as promoting fairness in the food chain.  78 A. Moragues-Faus•   Prioritizing  learning and empowerment  processes, creating participa-tory spaces for decision-making, as well as sharing knowledge and rais-ing awareness of the food system.  •   Fostering positive synergies between  urban and rural  areas through food.         New Urban Food Politics: The Emergence of Spaces of Deliberation  Following PE thinking, in order to transform the food system, it is para-mount to change current power confi gurations, by necessity, including new opinions and more voices in the process. Notwithstanding, the inno-vative role of cities as new food policy actors has also involved the creation of new spaces of deliberation and participation, consisting of alliances between local social movements and municipalities (see  Moragues- Faus and Morgan  2015 ). In each city, this inherently political process has developed diff erently, leading to distinct confi gurations and results. By and large, the aim is to invite all interested stakeholders and those directly involved in the local food system: civil society organizations, local admin-istration, other public bodies, and the private sector. Th is group of stake-holders might be very diverse, since the inclusion of new topics in UFS beyond agricultural production has attracted new partners who were formerly excluded from these conversations, such as public health offi  -cials or planning departments. Th e fi nal structure of these new ‘spaces of deliberation’ can take a number of diff erent institutional forms, includ-ing Food Policy Councils (e.g. North America or Canada [Blay-Palmer  2009 ; Schiff   2008 ]), Food Boards (e.g. London [Reynolds  2009 ]), Food Partnerships (e.g. Brighton), Secretariats (e.g. Belo Horizonte, Brazil), or the like (discussed in Moragues-Faus et al.  2013 ).  Th ese new spaces of deliberation can be originated and driven by civil society organizations or by local authorities, creating opportunities to coordinate ongoing activities and foster new conversations and partner-ships. However, the main aim of these spaces is to develop or modify policies at the local level (Harper et al.  2009 ). In principle, these spaces have a more strategic character and the development of new projects or 3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 79activities is developed by specifi c organizations or actors. However, in order to modify food politics, it is essential to create new participation mechanisms with local dwellers. For example, some cities hold annual conferences, send weekly newsletters, hold training workshops and events, and so on. Nevertheless, there are concerns about whether these new food conversations are truly inclusive.      Urban Food Strategies and Political Ecology: Lessons for Mediterranean Urban Food Systems  More and more municipalities are developing food strategies, calling for a holistic view of the food system and creating new spaces for dialogue and deliberation between civil society organizations, private actors, and public institutions. In the UK, there are 40 cities that are part of the Sustainable Food Cities Network, and in the USA, there are around 200 food policy councils. Th is urban food movement off ers new practical and political directions to build a more sustainable food system. However, there are risks and challenges that need to be considered in order to modify inequality fl ows. Mobilizing PE as an overall framework, and using insights from an analysis of Spanish cases under food sovereignty approaches (see Emaus Fundación Social  2011 ; Moragues-Faus  2015 ), there are three main elements to be considered:•     Th e cost of building alliances : Despite the importance of debating and engaging with diff erent organizations, there can be costs associated with establishing collaborations with stakeholders that are not ‘natural’ allies. While in places like the UK, the food movement and civil soci-ety organizations in general have a long tradition of partnership with public and even private institutions, this is not necessarily the case in other countries, such as Spain, where campaigning, and in some cases confrontation, has been the main strategy. Th is change towards more cooperation between the public sector and civil society casts doubts about whether some organizations are winning infl uence and power by associating with some local authorities and other institutions or if they are compromising their creativity and radicalism. In the UK, the 80 A. Moragues-Faus institutionalization process of some organizations has made up for a shrinking local state, and even substituted delivery of some services (Deas  2012 ; Lewis  2005 ). Th is ‘hollowing out’ of the state is also man-ifested through the increasing importance of food banks in the UK and their legitimization as a key mechanism to solve food poverty. In places like Spain, civil society has generally remained outside of the public institutions, but recent political movements and parties (e.g. Podemos, Guanyem-Barcelona en Comú) are establishing new rela-tionships with organizations, and activists are taking part in new polit-ical parties and also creating spaces through which civil society can channel its demands.   •     New ﬂ ows or new inequalities : In some instances, the promotion of local, artisanal, and organic products leads to generating economic activities and spaces that exclude a large part of the population, mainly lower-income families. Th e literature on the local trap—or the risks of confl ating local with good and sustainable—is an excellent example of how local food discourses and associated practices can be rooted in neoliberal principles, or neglect environmental impacts not only on a local but also on a regional or global scale (Born and Purcell  2006 ; Guthman  2008 ). In the previous section, we showed some examples of how organic food or other high-quality products can conceal exploit-ative means of production. In the case of cities, food can constitute a tool to gentrify spaces, ultimately creating new, exclusive environ-ments accessible only to those with enough economic, social, and cul-tural resources. Furthermore, cities are rapidly gaining economic and political centrality, which posits questions in terms of spatial inequali-ties between cities and hinterlands or rural areas. It is paramount therefore to consider who is winning and who is losing with the estab-lishment of these activities, who is included/excluded, and how new socionatural confi gurations stemming from changes in the food sys-tem are transforming the endowments of diff erent groups. In places like Spain, the consumption of organic products is relatively low, and the ‘eat local’ discourse has had a more limited impact on purchasing habits. Th is represents an opportunity to develop initiatives that deliver the benefi ts associated with local and organic foods (Sonnino  2010 ) and also to promote social justice and redress inequalities.   3 Political Ecology of Mediterranean Agri-Food Systems 81•     More democracy or new elites : Th e new spaces of deliberation described above are at risk of being co-opted by old or new elites, since they have the economic, social, and cultural assets to access this type of spaces. As one activist from the city of Malmo puts it: ‘I think it will be very good to have a more formal space, and give people the opportunity to have their say about what developments they need. But the problem is that the people that are in the most diffi  cult situation, say single mums or incom-ing immigrants, would probably never come to those meetings’ (see more in Moragues-Faus and Morgan  2015 ). Consequently, these new spaces need to ensure they are promoting and facilitating the participation of new voices, assuming that integrating new, and usually politically mar-ginalized, actors is not resolved by just off ering an open space.          Conclusions  Th is chapter presented an account on how Mediterranean PEs have been surpassed in the food studies literature, mainly in terms of rural development approaches but potentially in new urban food debates. Th e analysis of these gaps using a PE framework allows to point out how the integration of socionatural sensibilities and histories, as well as a better focus on power relations, could enrich agri-food systems and rural devel-opment conceptualizations.  In the case of agrarian change and rural development approaches, it is paramount to develop a critical approach in order to understand socio-natural confi gurations of agrarian change, distinguishing between a deep understanding of the dynamics at play and the formulation of norma-tive rural development models. Th is means that it is vital to uncover paradoxes and contradictions between these normative models and the unsustainable or unjust processes they might be concealing. Th is includes also a critical analysis of processes of knowledge/theory building that frame the identifi cation of problems and solutions and, consequently, policy recommendations. Furthermore, Mediterranean studies show the need to acknowledge place-based socio-natures as key agents in confi gur-ing agri-food systems and rural spaces. Nevertheless, unveiling the rela-tions of production behind particular foodstuff s is not enough; it is also 82 A. Moragues-Faus important to engage in new inclusive conversations that create spaces of possibility for new socionatural confi gurations to emerge.  Th e emergence of cities as food policy actors also off ers an oppor-tunity to redress agrarian/rural stereotypes of food studies, by helping to develop analytical frameworks to studying urban food that are more sensitive to specifi c socionatural confi gurations as well as geographical specifi cities. Th is chapter has discussed how the fi eld of urban food is evolving, relying heavily on US and UK experiences. When analysing this new fi eld under PE premises, three key challenges emerge. Th e fi rst one brings to the forefront the role of the state and the risks and benefi ts of establishing partnerships between public institutions and civil society organizations. We need to assess potential institutionalization processes or shrinking of states in contrast with diff erent place-based traditions of civil  society involvement. Th e second challenge relates to how food can be used to create more inclusive spaces as well as exclusive spaces, and therefore points out the need to consider winners and losers when redefi ning food (socionatural) confi gurations. Finally, the focus on who is included and who is excluded should also extend to how power relations are modifi ed by these new spaces of deliberation and beyond them, in order to build a more democratic food system.

In doing so, it contributes to opening up what has become a rather narrow conversation that informs a limited set of tech-nical strategies. Th e central thesis of the chapter is that climate-driven distress is less of a threat (though by no means an insubstantial one) than overuse or unequal allocation of limited water resources. By extension, sustainable land and water management require much more than the provision of more irrigation.  Th ough these themes are discussed here with reference to empirical material drawn from India, they are applicable globally, given that around 40 % of the terrestrial surface is classifi ed as ‘dryland’. Th ese landscapes are distinguished by various degrees of ‘water limitation’, where aver-age rainfall is lower than potential moisture loss through transpiration or evaporation. Depending on the degree of water limitation, drylands may be classifi ed as dry sub-humid, semi-arid, arid, or hyper-arid. Each sub-type is characterized by ecosystems confi gured to particular levels of productivity determined largely by moisture availability. Th e drylands have tremendous signifi cance for human development and global social- ecological well-being. Some two billion people live and work in these landscapes globally, 90 % of them in developing countries. Around one billion of these people practise agriculture in dryland areas. A signifi -cant proportion of these rely primarily on rainfall—rather than on built irrigation infrastructures—for their supply of water; around a quarter of the world’s drylands are devoted to rainfed agriculture. Historically, for such communities, the relative water limitation inherent in dryland ecosystems has not constrained the existence of vibrant agricultural live-lihoods. A great variety of adaptations and management practices have allowed dryland communities to contend with the risks of relatively low or erratic precipitation, high temperatures, and relatively marginal soils that accompany land-based living in these landscapes. Th ese communi-ties have shown that careful management of blue and green water, soil health, and vegetation results in remarkably productive dryland land-scapes around the world.  However, rainfed drylands are now at the forefront of a number of social-ecological crises, bearing much of the global burden of hunger, thirst, and poverty. Land-based livelihoods in such contexts are severely constrained by degradation. It is estimated that between 10 % (United 92 Z.P. BharuchaNations  2011 ) and 25 % (Wiesmeier  2015 ) of the world’s drylands have already been degraded—experiencing some combination of groundwa-ter decline, soil erosion, and de-vegetation suffi  ciently severe to impair productivity and livelihoods (United Nations  2011 ). Degradation in the drylands also imposes a signifi cant human cost. Some 1.5 billion people are thought to be aff ected (UNCCD  2011 ), with poverty acting as both outcome and driver of land degradation and limiting the nutritional security of people working in these agricultural landscapes.  Th e urgency of these challenges is brought into sharp relief by climate change, which will intensify the pressures already experienced by agri-cultural communities in the drylands. At the same time, an urbanizing and increasingly affl  uent world will drive bigger demand for food, fi bre, fuel, and feed crops. Agricultural communities in the drylands will need to play their role in meeting these global challenges of food and energy security, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation. It is now clear that these challenges are generated by particular social and economic responses to dryland landscapes, rather than by the intrinsic biophysi-cal characteristics of the ecosystems themselves. Drylands have often suf-fered from endemic lack of policy support and chronic under-investment (Barrow  2014 ) as well as inappropriate resource management. Unsuitable land use, competing demands on resources, and the breakdown of tra-ditional resource management institutions have exacerbated the social- ecological pressures facing land-based communities in the drylands.  Building social-ecological resilience in rainfed drylands will mean con-fronting the paradigms, policies, and processes which have thus far sin-gularly failed to advance sustainable, viable, and vibrant land-based living in drylands. Already, tensions between resource availability and seem-ingly inexorable increases in demand are giving new life to long-standing debates on dryland management around the role of climate versus human activities (e.g. Akhtar-Schuster et al.  2000 ), the complex infl uence of poverty on degradation (e.g. Mortimore and Harris  2005 ; Mortimore  2005 ), and (though perhaps less so) the nature of the demands social groups make of the land. Th ese conversations will have wide relevance beyond the ‘small, poor farmers’ who have thus far been at the forefront of concerns about degradation, poverty, and dryland agriculture. For example, as this chapter is being composed in November 2015, drought 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 93in California is forcing regulators, farmers, residents, and consumers around the world to confront the complex collision of climatic factors (either periodic El Niño or emerging global climate change), resource waste, global  high- value agricultural commodities, and competition between agricultural and non-agricultural water use.  Th is analysis draws on a long tradition of critical scholarship within the environmental social sciences, particularly political ecology, to explore the dynamics of social-ecological vulnerability, rural development, and resource governance in dryland agricultural landscapes. Specifi cally, I intend to discuss the case of smallholder agriculture in the Indian rain-fed drylands—an exemplar case of dryland sustainability challenges—to show how continuing social-ecological vulnerability here is generated, in part, because of an incomplete diagnosis of the complex problems of water scarcity and agrarian distress, which in turn generates limited tech-nocentric solutions and perverse unintended impacts.  My starting point is a set of three ‘received wisdoms’ concerning water and dryland agriculture: fi rst, that ‘water  scarcity  is the predominant fea-ture of drylands’ (United Nations  2011 : 30, emphasis added); second, that this scarcity is the predominant driver of agrarian distress; and third, that scarcity is best alleviated by increasing the supply of irrigation. Th e aim of this chapter is to critically interrogate these established, self- reinforcing wisdoms by referencing empirical material from the Indian case. I show how policy, development practice, and even popular media commonly trace direct links between relatively limited rainfall, water scarcity, and social-ecological distress. Low rainfall fi gures are pitted against growing demands so that scarcity becomes naturalized. Th e overriding imagery is of parched landscapes that lie at the mercy of the rain, unable to provide enough for local food security, let alone attain enough productivity for agricultural commodity markets. Th ese widespread visions and the pre-scriptions that follow are simple and compelling. Th e practical agenda that follows is also clear: a foremost task for development practitioners is to tackle the availability of water in the landscape. Again with reference to India, I show that the resulting governance regimes are quite techno-centric in nature and have limited potential to address the real and com-plex concerns of people living and working in water-limited landscapes. Please, also refer to Chap.   5     for drylands in Brazil. 94 Z.P. Bharucha Th is exercise does not diminish the real and lived material experience of scarcity in the drylands. Nor is it the intention to discount the value of managing supply. Instead, the point is to contribute to a growing body of literature that calls into question the hegemony of the ‘scarcity dis-course’ (Mahayni  2013 ; Mehta  2010 ). Evidence from a range of per-spectives is converging to show that the ‘scare’ of scarcity (Mehta  2010 ) is neither an accurate nor a particularly helpful way to approach water- limited landscapes. Interrogating the nature, dynamics, and implications of a scarcity discourse in water management uncovers new spaces within which to recast old problems and challenge accepted ways of approaching them (Lankford  2005 ). Whereas the received wisdom paints a relatively generalized picture of climate-induced distress, more nuanced perspec-tives show that resilience or vulnerability is generated by many factors in addition to climate and is, in fact, amenable to management. Dryland communities, policymakers, and resource managers all have agency, actively mediating the ‘resource environment’ through their decisions. Th e macro- and micro-politics of allocation generate or alleviate scar-cities by governing access and the uses to which  limited —rather than ‘scarce’—resources are put. Uncovering these dynamics reveals practical options for management and is thus a highly pragmatic exercise at a time of widespread alarm about planetary limits (cf. Rockström et al.  2009 ; Steff en et al.  2015 ).  In what follows, I touch on these points with reference to India, with a focus on the state of Maharashtra, a particularly signifi cant site within which to interrogate the dynamics of water scarcity, agrarian distress, and water governance in rainfed dryland landscapes. Th e chapter fi rst out-lines the material scope of dryland rainfed agriculture in India and the discursive environment which has come to characterize responses to it. I then show how both conventional management responses and seemingly radical alternatives are bound up in a paradigm where naturalized scarcity is the central problematic and increased water supply is the dominant response. I outline emerging evidence showing that management inter-ventions embedded in this paradigm generate perverse social-ecological outcomes. Th is evidence is then discussed in the light of a brief review of scholarship which fi nesses the links between climate, scarcity, and agrarian distress. Th e chapter concludes with refl ections on the key lessons learned.  4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 95    A Climate of Crisis in the Indian Drylands  Indian agriculture—and by extension India’s economy and social infra-structure—is fundamentally and perhaps uniquely dependent on the ‘remarkable stability’ of the seasonal Asian monsoon (Turner  2013 ). Every summer, a reversal of winds brings rain-bearing clouds from the southwest Indian Ocean. Th ese sweep northwards across the Indian land-mass, bringing 80 % of the rainfall that falls over the subcontinent. A warm, wet season of four months ensues, during which farmers plant the main ( kharif ) crop (June to September). Untimely, inadequate, or excessive rains disrupt food production, commodity prices, the availabil-ity of drinking water, and (given India’s signifi cant dependence on hydro-power) electricity generation. Th ese disruptions cascade across both rural and urban India. Th e centrality of the monsoon has meant that the rains are the focus of both celebration and anxiety. In Indian cultural iconogra-phy and everyday social experience, timely and adequate rain means life, fertility, and hope. Dry spells, droughts, or fl oods mean ruination and despair on a colossal scale.  Yet, India leads the world in the prevalence of rainfed agriculture, mea-sured by both area and value of produce (Rao et al.  2015 ). Approximately 90 % of India’s cropland is located within the ‘water-limited tropics’ (Milesi et al.  2010 ). Th ough some 80 % of the freshwater abstracted in India is used for irrigation (Shah  2013 ), rainfed agriculture of vari-ous types constitute between 60 % and 70 % of India’s cultivated land. Rainfed systems produce around 40 % of India’s food and support around 40 % of the national population. Important food and commercial crops depend fundamentally on rainfed systems, which produce 44 % of India’s rice, 87 % of its coarse cereals, 85 % of food legumes, 72 % of oilseeds, 65 % of cotton, and 90 % of minor millets (Rao et al.  2015 ). Th us, rain-fed systems are critical for India’s food and livelihood security.  As in the rest of the world, these landscapes are in the midst of a human-made crisis. Land degradation, poverty, and hunger loosely over-lap in the Indian drylands (Reddy and Reddy  2002 ), with some 30 % of the population in India’s degraded semi-arid watersheds living below the poverty line (Ryan and Spencer  2001 ). Th e extent of total degraded land 96 Z.P. Bharuchais judged to be between 75.5 and 103 million hectares, most of which is to be found in semi-arid and arid areas (Ravindra  2007 ). Soil loss costs the equivalent of around 10 % of India’s annual agricultural production (Babu and Dhyani  2005 ), and in rainfed areas cultivating major cereal, oilseed, and pulse crops, water erosion causes losses valued at around US$2.51 billion (Sharda et al.  2010 : 79). Rainfed systems show large yield gaps relative to irrigated systems (Rao et al.  2015 ). Yet, the impor-tance of these regions is only set to grow: some 40 % of India’s net sown area would be totally rainfed even if the country’s irrigation potential were completely fulfi lled (Rao et al.  2015 ) (as discussed subsequently, this is not necessarily a desirable objective from a social and environmen-tal perspective). While India is currently self-suffi  cient in the production of major food crops, improving the viability of dryland agriculture is a key concern for alleviating the hunger and poverty that are particularly concentrated in rainfed dryland landscapes.  Over time, the overarching metanarrative describing the challenges faced by the rainfed drylands has drawn relatively simple causal links between climate and water scarcity and between this scarcity and the unfolding agrarian crises in these landscapes. In this conception,  climate—and rainfall in particular—occupies a particularly central posi-tion in the discourse, practice, and policy of Indian water governance. Th is centrality is especially evident in discourses and policies focused on the drylands. A small indicative selection covering materials presented by government actors (points 1–3) and scholarship (points 4 and 5) is presented in Box  4.1 .    Box 4.1 Selection of narratives on rainfed drylands and their management in India  1. ‘Rainfall and snowfall are the ultimate sources of water for meet-ing needs of drinking, irrigation, groundwater recharging (sic), rainfed agriculture, and environmental fl ows, fl ood and farm income securi-ties…The implications of abnormal monsoon were more devastating in dryland agriculture without ground water utilities’ Government of India ( 2013 : 29). 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 97 As this small sample of comments illustrates, the prevailing discur-sive environment  causally  ties together climate, water, and agrarian dis-tress in the rainfed drylands, which are viewed as ‘fragile’, ‘intrinsically’ prone to ‘nature-induced risks’, poverty, and marginality, particularly when ‘compared to the prime land areas of the country’. Vulnerability is thus ‘naturalized’: understood to be primarily an outcome of biophysical  factors—precipitation, aridity, and ‘fragile ecosystems’. In this  discourse, the line connecting these ‘nature-induced’ factors with hunger and  poverty is straight, and it is short.  How does this discursive context play out in the policy and practice of water governance in the drylands, and with what impacts? To fully explore this question, it is fi rst necessary to take a detour, briefl y tracing the dominant features of water management for agriculture in India.   2. ‘An insight into the rainfed regions reveals a grim picture of poverty, water scarcity, rapid depletion of the ground water table and fragile ecosys-tems’ Government of India ( 2011 : 4).  3. ‘…stopping farmer’s suicides is the biggest challenge before the gov-ernment and to meet it, we have undertaken a fl agship programme…which aims at making 5000 state villages permanently water-scarcity free. If this succeeds, it will mark an end to farmer’s woes. [Existing initiatives to relieve agrarian distress] cost  crore s  a   [which] went down the drain as [they] did not try to go to the root of the problem, which was inadequacy of irrigation’: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announcing the new rural development scheme in the state of Maharashtra (Deccan Herald  2015 ).  4. ‘The fragile regions such as the Indian dry tropical areas have several nature-induced risks and vulnerabilities. Their specifi c features…such as a high degree of fragility, marginality, diversity and limited accessibility (when compared to prime land areas of the country) generate the circum-stances that keep them poor and contribute to their low productivity…’ Jodha et al. ( 2012 : 3).  5. ‘Rain-fed areas are confronted with the intrinsic problem of degrada-tion of land and water…A vast proportion of rain-fed areas faces arid and semi-arid type of situations and receive scanty rains for nearly 50–55 days during monsoons, which is grossly insuffi cient to meet the year-round water requirement’ Joshi et al. ( 2011 : 224).    a One  crore  = 10 million in the Indian numbering system.   Source : Various sources. 98 Z.P. Bharucha    The Waterscapes of Indian Agriculture  Historically, the seasonality and intermittency of the Indian monsoon has not acted as the primary barrier to dryland agricultural communities in India. Farmers in these landscapes have enjoyed a rich legacy of successful water governance dating back to antiquity. An array of techniques, tech-nologies, and practices has built on the seasonality of the rainfall to build stable and remarkably productive agricultural communities (see Agarwal and Narain  1997 , for a seminal chronicling of traditional management techniques from across India). Technologies and practices show a great variety of forms, including capturing rainwater falling on open commu-nity lands (e.g. via structures called  kundis  2 ); harvesting fl ood water from streams and rivers; building embankments, gullies, and check dams to control soil erosion and improve percolation; and maintaining commu-nity tanks and shared wells to provide water for drinking and irrigation. Strategies have thus incorporated elements that, variously, increase stor-age, confi gure the fl ow of blue water (surface or ground), and manage green water through, for example, improving soil quality and biomass content. Crucially, these historical, communal arrangements have incor-porated a number of governance practices focused on risk management, resource sharing, and long-term maintenance. For example, in the arid northern state of Rajasthan, groups come together to construct tem-porary dams called  hembars  over seasonal streams, from which water is channelled into users’ fi elds. Construction is a group activity led by experienced local farmers, who manage both the physical infrastructure and the cropping pattern of benefi ciaries—selection of crops, the area allowed to be irrigated, and the frequency of irrigation are the same for all members, irrespective of the size of their lands. To enforce the prin-ciple of equal entitlement to water for all members, tail-end farmers who may receive comparatively less water are encouraged to enter into crop- sharing arrangements with head-end farmers.  Th is body of knowledge and practice unfortunately entered into a long period of decline during the last decades of the colonial period and then 2   Kundis  consist of an artifi cially created circular microcatchment. Rainwater drains from this catch-ment into a covered well. 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 99immediately following Indian Independence in 1947. Th e new Indian state was faced with a large agrarian population experiencing severe prob-lems of food insecurity and poverty, driven in no small part by the dis-mantling of traditional resource management institutions set up during the colonial period and accompanying changes in socio-economic rela-tions (Davis  2000 ; Jodha  1995 ). For the new Indian state, there was a general consensus that agricultural intensifi cation was urgently required to deal with these challenges. In response, the thrust of water and agri-cultural policy shifted overwhelmingly towards increasing the availability of surface and groundwater irrigation, particularly in areas favourable for agricultural intensifi cation. In the northern Indian states—the heart-lands of the Indian Green Revolution—farmers received free electricity to pump groundwater, improved seeds, subsidized inputs, and minimum support prices. Output soared, and to commentators, this suggested ‘the power of the new technology to liberate the fortunes of Indian agricul-ture from  the vagaries of the monsoon ’ (Frankel  1971 : 8, emphasis added). Groundwater abstraction rose phenomenally, with landowners given full rights to abstract water from aquifers on their land. High rates of abstrac-tion continue to the present, with most groundwater abstraction con-trolled by individual landowners (Cullet  2014 ). Th e Green Revolution states of northern India are now perhaps ‘the most heavily irrigated region in the world’ (Tiwari et al.  2009 : 1). Surveying aquifers in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, Rodell et al. ( 2009 ) found that over a six-year period between 2002 and 2008, groundwater depletion in these states was approximately 109 km 3  of water—equivalent to around double the capacity of India’s largest surface-water reservoir. Crucially, the last authors state that ‘annual rainfall was close to normal through-out the period’, as were other hydrological features such as soil moisture, surface fl ows, runoff , and biomass, suggesting that ‘consumption…for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the main cause’ of depletion (p. 999). Placing groundwater loss in the region in a global perspective, Tiwari et al. ( 2009 : 1) state that ‘this is probably the largest rate of groundwater loss in any comparable-sized region on Earth’.  In addition to increased groundwater abstraction, the Green Revolution was also accompanied by huge increases in surface-water 100 Z.P. Bharucha irrigation  capacity through the implementation of minor irrigation works as well as large river-based infrastructure projects. From the sec-ond half of the twentieth century, India embarked on a programme of dam building that now places it third globally in numbers of large dams completed—some 5000 to date, with another 345 still under construc-tion (National Register of Large Dams, n.d.). Drawing on British colo-nial legacies of building permanent headworks and elaborate diversion systems, ‘irrigation was transformed from a seasonal to a perennial pos-sibility’ (D’Souza  2008 ). Accompanying hydraulic interventions was the systematic dismantling of long-standing traditions and institutions of water governance, and ‘having thereby relentlessly extinguished other ways, techniques, arrangements, traditions and cultures for managing and conserving water in India, the large dam is still always pursued as the TINA (there is no alternative) option’ (D’Souza  2008 ). At the same time, for policymakers, increasing irrigation potential represents a highly visible and politically expedient way in which to be seen to be doing something about agricultural productivity and for ‘the national good’.  Th ese modes of water management impose heavy social-ecological costs. An estimated 40 million citizens have been directly displaced by large dams in India, ‘with possibly a mere tiny fraction of this huge number of oustees having managed anywhere near meaningful resettle-ment’ (D’Souza  2008 ). Irrigated lands are now experiencing declining productivity. Around a million hectares of agricultural land in north-west India are aff ected by irrigation-induced salinization, caused by the application of poor-quality groundwater (Datta and de Jong  2002 ). In the state of Haryana, waterlogging and salinity cause losses estimated at US$37 million annually (ibid.). Datta and de Jong conclude their analy-sis with an observation that foregrounds the policy and economic driv-ers of degradation: ‘… intensiﬁ cation  per se  is not the root cause of land degradation ,  but rather the policy environment that encouraged inappropri-ate land use and injudicious input use ,  especially excessive irrigation. Trade policies ,  output price policies and input subsidies all have contributed to the degradation of agricultural land ’ (p. 223). In other words, the prevailing political  economies and ecologies of land use have driven unsustainable  overconsumption and degradation. 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 101 Perhaps most perverse has been the singular failure of irrigation proj-ects to actually meet their own objectives. Analysing offi  cial data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture, Th akkar ( 2010 ) fi nds that between 1991 and 2007, some Rs. 142,000  crores  (approximately US$ 21.4 bil-lion) were spent on major irrigation projects with the stated objective of increasing canal irrigation. Yet, ‘the offi  cial data shows that this whole expenditure…has not led to the addition of a single hectare in the net irrigated area by canals in the country for the whole of this fi fteen year period’ (ibid.). It is also clear that where irrigation potential has been cre-ated, it may not necessarily alleviate agrarian distress: water is appropri-ated largely by the powerful, articulate, and privileged farmers who are able to cultivate profi table water-intensive crops. Th is dynamics is well demonstrated in the state of Maharashtra, which has more large dams than any other state in India, but where the overwhelming majority of irrigation is appropriated by the vastly lucrative sugarcane crop, which is only grown on some 4 % of the state’s agricultural land.  Finally, once established, projects do not necessarily provide water for long: siltation and lack of proper repair and maintenance have cut deeply into the storage and distribution capacity of existing irrigation infrastruc-ture. Investment in creating new storage is not matched by the availabil-ity of funds to maintain it. A World Bank report, for example, fi nds that some Rs. 17,000  crores  (just over US$ 250 million) are required  annually  for the upkeep of India’s irrigation infrastructure, but less than 10 % of this amount is actually available (World Bank  2005 ) and even less is likely to be spent eff ectively (Th akkar  2010 ).  Th is irrigation-intensive model of agricultural intensifi cation con-tinues to this day, as does the long-standing neglect of rainfed areas. Landscapes without recourse to built irrigation infrastructures were rela-tively neglected during the Green Revolution, as evidenced by dispropor-tionate discrepancies in dedicated investment and systematic planning relative to irrigated areas. Up to the late 1980s for example—during the height of the Green Revolution—investment in irrigation and fl ood con-trol was  22 times  that dedicated to soil and water conservation in the non-irrigated zones (Vaidyanathan  1994 ). Until as late as 1985, rain-fed zones were ‘unrecognized in mainstream planning’, and their fi rst inclusion in the national planning process (during the Seventh Five Year 102 Z.P. BharuchaPlan period from 1985 to 1990) was accompanied by the admission that ‘decades of neglect had led to dryland areas being caught in a vicious circle of high risk, low investment, poor technology and low production’ (Chhotray  2011 : 56). Yet, lethargy continues, as does a discursive envi-ronment naturalizing the problems of drylands. Th ough India’s current (12th) Five Year Plan (2012–2017) provides for a National Programme on Rainfed Farming (NPRF), three years into the fi ve-year plan period, the programme is yet to be implemented because of a lack of capacity to work at the local level in rainfed regions, which are considered by the policymakers themselves as ‘resource-poor, unpredictable and diverse’ (interviews with representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, quoted in IIED  2015 : 2).  It is against this background that scholarship and popular advocacy have called for alternative approaches to water and land management in the rainfed drylands. Mindful of the social-ecological perversities gen-erated by top-down and technocentric models in irrigated landscapes, advocates have called for alternatives which are participatory, decentral-ized, and ‘integrated’ and which build local communities and ecologies. In regions with no access to centralized irrigation infrastructures, partici-patory watershed development (WSD) has evolved into the most wide-spread such alternative, and is now India’s foremost strategy for (linked) dryland management and rural development. WSD projects have become an essential feature of the waterscape of the rural drylands, aiming to build social-ecological resilience and rejuvenate agricultural incomes that have until now lagged far behind those of farmers in irrigated regions. Projects, whether funded and implemented by either state or non-state development agencies, focus on single or small groups of villages which may be grouped together as a microcatchment. Within these boundaries, agencies work with local communities to implement soil conservation and rainwater harvesting, recharge aquifers, add vegetation, and set up community groups for resource management.  Th is approach largely mirrors the basic tenets of an integrated water resource management (IWRM) approach and crafts a  ‘complementarity between conservation and productivity objectives’ (Kerr  2001 : 1387). It represents a practical acknowledgement of the now well-recognized links between social and environmental well-being. As such, WSD has 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 103been viewed as a strong countercurrent to the ‘big project’ mania that otherwise dominates Indian water governance, and as a departure from single-focus projects that restrict themselves to the provision of water for irrigation to the exclusion of other aspects of water use and management. Watershed projects also incorporate a long-term vision of stewardship. After the completion of fi ve-year projects, the aim is that any water man-agement structures that are built will be managed by local communities with dedicated bank accounts and management groups supporting this objective. Women’s groups and small savings societies are set up during the project, and these are designed to continue after its completion with a view to encourage livelihood diversifi cation. Th e autonomy of local communities is foregrounded, at least in theory, in stark contrast to the encounters between local communities and large irrigation infrastruc-tures. Crucially, watershed projects are meant to off er a wider array of options than simply increasing the supply of blue water. Instead, there is a provision for ‘dry issues’ (Rockström et al.  2010 ) such as preventing soil erosion, improving soil quality, and adding biomass and organic matter. Th e potential for increased fl ows of green water is thus implicit in the practice of WSD, as is the recognition that low productivity in dryland landscapes is not exclusively a function of irrigation, but instead, can be improved by enhancing soil moisture, soil quality, soil organic content (SOC), and vegetation (Srinivasarao et al.  2014 ).  In summary, then, conventional approaches to increasing water sup-ply have generated a number of social-ecological perversities which WSD, as a seemingly radical alternative, seeks to avoid. In what follows, I unpack this contention by exploring the long-term performance of watershed projects and tracing the dominant ideologies informing prac-tice on the ground.      Unpacking Alternatives  WSD has enabled some remarkable transformations in rainfed dry-land landscapes. A number of pioneering cases, notably the villages of Ralegaon Siddhi and Hivre Bazar in the state of Maharashtra, are lauded worldwide as exemplars of participatory, decentralized, and ‘integrated’ 104 Z.P. Bharucharesource stewardship. Yet, over time, it is becoming clear that the trans-formations seen in these seminal cases are not mirrored in more general practice. Th e evidence base is limited. Comparative and longitudinal analyses are rare, with most evaluations cast in the relatively instrumental idiom of rural development indicators, assessing changes in crop produc-tivity and farmers’ incomes mainly in the short-term following projects. Perhaps understandably, success is more visible than general outcomes—and failure is barely visible at all. Available empirical evidence highlights a signifi cant gap between the potential and the reality of the watershed programme. Outcomes are found to be patchy, varying from ‘the spectac-ular’ to the ‘once good but now not very good’ (Samuel et al.  2007 : 71). To explain this patchiness, early evaluations of WSD projects focused primarily on the social dynamics of project design and implementation. Th ese cited factors such as lack of a proper participatory process, inequi-table distribution of costs and benefi ts, and socio-cultural, institutional, and administrative barriers to sustained community engagement (see, among others, Bouma et al.  2007 ; Joshi et al.  2004 ; Kerr et al.  2000 ; Mishra  2010 ; Phadke  2013 ; Samuel et al.  2007 ,  2009 ; Sharma  2003 ).  Giving due credence to these factors, an emerging stream of schol-arship nevertheless calls for a more fundamental critique. Scholarship in this stream interrogates the foundational premises shaping projects and their outcomes. Specifi cally, emerging evidence suggests that gaps between promise and reality may derive from the fact that watershed projects might be operating within the same  milieu  as that which governs Indian water management more generally. Th at is, watershed practice may be manifesting the dominant ‘common sense’, linking water scarcity directly with lack of rainfall, and centralizing the singular aim of water provision in response. Researchers have pointed out, for example, that programmes have relied on a number of ‘myths’ about water,  rainfall, and climate—one being that rainfall has been progressively declining and that this underlies water scarcity (Batchelor et al.  2003 ). Th e Drought-Prone Areas Programme (DPAP)—a key initiative for WSD—for example, aimed to ‘drought-proof’ the rainfed drylands, and is premised on the need to minimize ‘the adverse eff ects of drought on the production of crops and livestock and productivity of land, water and human resources’ (Singh and Ballabh  2008 : 162). In other words, the central problematic 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 105was considered to be a question of rainfall and aridity. Finally, Calder ( 2005 ) highlights how incorrect assumptions about land–water interac-tions have underpinned the Indian WSD programme and resulted in  increased  groundwater abstraction and  reduced  access to common-prop-erty water resources for poor people, among other negative social-eco-logical externalities. For these scholars then, WSD practice is not simply suboptimal because of improper implementation. Instead, improper diagnosis of the problem drives the gap between promise and reality.  Further evidence along these lines is provided by recent research on the long-term outcomes of WSD in the state of Maharashtra (Bharucha et al.  2014 ). Interviews with farmers showed that they overwhelmingly thought of declining rainfall as the chief driver of water scarcity and agrarian dis-tress, despite the fact that aggregate rainfall had not shown signifi cant declines over a 100-year period (ibid.). Qualitative narratives also show that farmers may simply be viewing projects as avenues for the provision of irrigation rather than as a multifaceted and multipronged strategy to institute broad-ranging management across the social- ecological system. For example, some ten years after the completion of projects, benefi ciaries described how ‘[t]here used to be only 50 wells in the village. Now there are 400! If previously 50 wells were being used for 400 acres, now one well is used for one acre!  Th is is an improvement ,  isn ’ t it ?’ (Bharucha et al.  2014 , emphasis added). Well-digging is regarded as a non- negotiable, practical necessity, as exemplifi ed by the following excerpt from a focus group (Box  4.2 ) in the study site.    Box 4.2 Focus group narratives on well-digging following watershed development (WSD)   Farmer 1 : Suppose that today, I require some water. I have a shortage of water in the well for my fi elds. I do not have enough to drink. Then, I will immediately dig a bore well. [If] I have money with me, I will dig a bore[well].   Farmer 2 : It’s not just that. It’s not just money. Suppose you take a bore[well] [ referring to focus group participant ]. Then [even] if I don’t have enough money, even if I don’t have anything—I will dig a bore[well]. I will do anything, I will take a loan, but I will dig a bore[well].   Source : Bharucha et al. ( 2014 ). 106 Z.P. Bharucha Other evaluations have found that following WSD, farmers may have been increasing the abstraction of groundwater based on erroneous beliefs about the potential of soil and water conservation to recharge aquifers. Samuel et al. ( 2007 ), for example, found that in recent years, farmers may have been tapping groundwater too deeply for it to be recharged by rainfall, thus weakening claims that WSD is driving a resurgence of rural prosperity via sustainable improvements to irrigation. Th ere is also indication that farmers switch from traditional ‘dry’ crops such as millets and sorghum to relatively water-intensive crops following WSD, a transi-tion that is then locked into place, as the switch to high-value cultivation costs money, making it prohibitive to switch back to dry crops off ering relatively low returns (Bouma et al.  2007 ). In the state of Maharashtra, ten years after the completion of watershed projects, farmers almost unanimously reported the decline or cessation of the cultivation of ‘dry’ crops such as horse gram ( Macrotyloma uniﬂ orum ) and moth bean ( Vigna aconitifolia ) (Bharucha et al.  2014 ). Th us, rather than WSD being used to strengthen the resilience of rainfed cultivation, it is instead acting as a catalyst for the transition to a relatively high-input regime of irrigated, commercial cultivation. Interviews with farmers revealed that this change is overwhelmingly framed with reference to the climate. Th at is, farmers state that traditional ‘dry’ crops can no longer be grown because there is not enough rainfall to do so. Yet, both horse gram and moth bean possess immense adaptability to conditions of poor soil and low rainfall; traits that have ensured their place as traditional staple crops in dryland India (Brink and Belay  2006 ; Gadgil and Guha  1992 ; Nene  2006 ). In further conver-sation, it became clear that farmers were in fact simply turning away from rainfed cultivation altogether, viewing it as a negative choice rather than as a regime to be strengthened by WSD. Instead, they described how WSD had provided greater access to irrigation, allowing them to cultivate more irrigated and lucrative crops: ‘[W]e do not have to grow crops which are wholly dependent on the rainfall’ (Bharucha et al.  2014 : 9). For these farmers then, WSD is viewed as a means to increasing the availability of water for irrigation, as a catalyst away from rainfed cultivation and as a means to intensify cultivation of relatively lucrative crops.  What does this mean for the social-ecological resilience of rainfed dryland communities? Are farmers who have used WSD to intensify 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 107 cultivation more or less vulnerable than before? Conversations around these themes are notably absent in the scholarly literature, which largely neglects to collect systematic accounts of the lived experience of ‘project benefi ciaries’ over time. For interviewees in Maharashtra, the increased abstraction of groundwater for farming has not necessarily alleviated the  experience  of water scarcity and there is still a dominant perception that rainfall remains the ultimate arbiter of water availability (Box  4.3 ), even as well-digging and the intensifi cation of irrigation continue apace (Bharucha et al.  2014 ).   Taken together, these narratives suggest a process in which the attri-bution of deepening scarcity to rainfall goes hand in hand with—or even enables—the continuing unsustainable abstraction of groundwa-ter. Tellingly, groundwater abstraction and the intensifi cation of irri-gation are both strictly regulated in the seminal WSD cases on which the contemporary programme is based. Grassroots community work in Ralegaon Siddhi, for example, has included long-term rules limiting the cultivation of water-intensive sugarcane and the sinking of deep bore wells. By contrast, on-the-ground experience in contemporary projects tends to show the process moving in exactly the opposite direction: WSD becomes a means by which individual farmers justify increased abstrac-tion of groundwater, though these claims do not necessarily hold in the light of what is known about the links between water conservation and aquifer recharge (cf. Samuel et al.  2007 ).   Box 4.3 Farmers’ narratives on water scarcity, rainfall, and watershed development (WSD)  ‘In the end, what ultimately determines a farm’s viability is rain. WSD can-not buffer against major changes in climate. The WSD advantage so far is only that there is a slight increase in water and therefore slight shortages can be buffered’.  ‘In dry regions, there is no alternative except for it to rain. Suppose it were a place serviced by a canal. Even if it didn’t rain, they could release water from a dam, then people could carry on. There is nothing like this here’.   Source : Bharucha et al. ( 2014 ). 108 Z.P. Bharucha We are thus faced with a situation in which both conventional water management and well-regarded, ‘integrated’ alternatives are bound together by a metanarrative wherein the problem is viewed as climate- driven scarcity and the solution is almost always to increase water supply. Perverse impacts follow from both. Whereas these have been comprehen-sively chronicled with regard to large dam and canal projects, emerging scholarship on the unintended outcomes generated by alternatives is only just developing. What evidence that does exist highlights the need for a critical rethink of the assumed links between climate, scarcity, and agrar-ian distress. A multidisciplinary body of literature critically analyses agrar-ian distress, land degradation, and the impacts of drought as complex multicausal phenomena rather than as singular outcomes of inadequate rainfall. Empirical work fi nessing this nexus of issues loosens the links between climate, scarcity, and distress that are so tightly woven together in the ‘accepted’ reality of water and land management. It is impossible to provide a comprehensive review of this literature in the space of a single chapter; what follows is simply a brief overview of some of its key themes and insights. Th ese open up new spaces and potentials for eff ective water governance that contributes to social-ecological resilience.  Th e fi rst vein comes from critical accounts of environmental and economic history. Th ese have nuanced our understanding of the links between drought, agrarian distress, and famine by highlighting the  infl uence of particular political and economic confi gurations that either amplify social-ecological vulnerability or block communities’ abilities to adapt to the vagaries of climate. Th e seminal work of Mike Davis com-prehensively and powerfully illustrates the specifi c infl uence of national and international economic policy in driving agrarian distress during the nineteenth-century El Niño (Davis  2000 ). For Davis, neither the fact that rainfall was insuffi  cient nor Malthusian explanations of population growth driving famine adequately explain the scale of damage and degree of suff ering experienced around the world during the nineteenth century. Instead, the incorporation of peasant agronomies into global commodity chains, the dismantling of traditional systems of crisis management (e.g. locally controlled grain stores), high unemployment, and high prices all combined to ‘turn drought into famine’ on a catastrophic scale. Davis quotes the Famine Commissions which found that ‘supplies of food were 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 109at all times suffi  cient, and it cannot be too frequently repeated that severe privation was chiefl y due to the dearth of employment in agriculture [arising from the drought]’ (in Davis  2002 : 161).  Scholars focusing on India were particularly exercised by these ques-tions following the central Indian drought of 1972. Oughton ( 1982 ) shows how human suff ering associated with the drought was not exclu-sively the result of inadequate rainfall. Instead, agrarian distress was gen-erated by the combined impacts of the relatively low spread of irrigation, the adoption of water-intensive cash crops in surrounding districts rather than of cereals, and a poor public food distribution system that did not eff ectively distribute aid. Examining the causes of increased vulnerability to drought in India, Kumar ( 1988 : 1) begins by noting that ‘despite no changes in rainfall patterns, there is evidence that droughts have been causing successively larger variations in employment and rural incomes’. He proceeds to highlight the macroeconomic factors that underlie drought vulnerability and concludes that interregional inequality needs to be directly addressed through ‘a much larger eff ective level of public investment in agriculture—with particular emphasis on the poorer rain-fed regions’ (p. 30).  In a diff erent vein, the role of water-intensive crops is critically examined in the context of contemporary struggles over water and sustainable dryland livelihoods. For example, commenting on agrar-ian distress in the state of Maharashtra, the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP  2015 ) discusses the case of sug-arcane cultivation in the district of Marathwada. SANDRP acknowl-edges that the region is water-limited and even ‘drought prone’, but questions why, nevertheless, ‘in 2013, Marathwada grew over 2  lakh  3  hectares of sugarcane and is now crushing the cane in its 61 sugar fac-tories using thousands of  lakhs  of water every day’. In another report on the perverse juxtaposition of water-guzzling crops in water-limited landscapes, SANDRP describes how, in the district of Solapur, ‘[i]n 2012–13, a year that was called a drought year, worse than (the) 1972 drought, Solapur added 4 new sugar factories’ (SANDRP  2013 : 2). Following SANDRP, then, we may say that while limited rainfall is a 3   1  lakh  = 100,000 in the Indian numbering system. 110 Z.P. Bharuchakey driver of water-limited landscapes, it is water-intensive  cropping patterns that push the boundaries between water limitation and water scarcity. At landscape and catchment level, the appropriation of water by sugarcane farmers and politically powerful sugar producers directly aff ects water for drinking or for the cultivation of other crops. In Solapur, ‘sugarcane and “tanker fed” villages co-exist’ (SANDRP  2013 : 6)—that is, water for drinking and household use is provided by a state-run tanker service, while local supplies of water are diverted to sugarcane cultivation. Th ese cropping patterns impact both food and water security. In Marathwada, water shortages have driven so-called cattle camps—the distress sale of cattle by farmers unable to support them through a dry period. A recent interview with a researcher- activist on Indian water management highlighted ‘ possibly one of the most tragic ironies of Maharashtra today : [ that ]  the cattle are fed with sugarcane fodder ’. Th e same activist also highlighted how grassroots agitations for drinking water coincide with the continued use of water for sugarcane cultivation and crushing:   While he  [activist Prabhakar Deshmukh]  was sitting on a fast for drinking water ,  sugarcane factories in his own village ,  3 sugar factories ,  one of them belonged to Pawar ,  were actually crushing sugarcane using nearly 6  lakh  liters of water per day. So we are not talking only about water for livelihood security. We are talking about drinking water security ,  water as a fundamental right to life ,  which is also sabotaged by sugarcane. And it ’ s not a one-oﬀ  case. It is a recurrent example … (Interview with researcher-activist on Indian water management, January 2015)  Commenting on the links between the local elite, sugarcane cultivation, and agrarian distress in the dryland district of Marathwada, an article in the newspaper  Economic Times  observes:   Sugarcane cultivation and sugar industries have for decades received privileged treatment ,  thanks to the factories being either owned or controlled by the state ’ s politicians. In 2012–13 ,  Marathwada added 20 sugar factories even as villages were supplied drinking water through tankers. Today ,  there are around 11  lakh  hectares under sugarcane and 205 sugar factories in the state ,  of which 70 are in Marathwada alone.  (Mohan  2015 ) 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 111 A third stream of critical insight is generated by political ecologies of water management and agrarian change. Mehta ( 2001 ) developed a seminal political ecology of water allocation in the dryland landscapes of India, revealing how narratives of water scarcity dominate both the politics and the everyday lived experience of people in the semi-arid Kutch region of Gujarat. She shows how these narratives are used to justify centralized irri-gation infrastructures—in this case the Sardar Sarovar Dam—which will supposedly alleviate scarcity by increasing the supply of irrigation. Mehta carefully unpacks these narratives to reveal how the spectre of ‘ dwindling rainfall and increasing droughts … can also be  “ manufactured ”  in such a way to serve the interests of powerful actors… ( Th ese )  popular perceptions of scarcity ,  as represented in the mass media and by politicians and advocates of the water question ,  have naturalized scarcity in Kutch ’ (p. 2026). For those holding this view, ‘there is unambiguous consensus…that climate change, independent of human intervention, exacerbates the problems of water scarcity’ (p. 2029). Yet, as Mehta shows, there have been no sig-nifi cant changes in rainfall that might explain these popular perceptions. Long-term analysis of rainfall patterns reveals that rainfall has always been variable, and no statistically signifi cant reductions are yet discernible. Instead, as Mehta reveals, water use has increased signifi cantly, driven by rising demand from a growing population and the intensifi cation of agriculture. Farmers have increased the number and depth of bore wells, and de-vegetation has led to increased soil erosion and reduced aquifer recharge. Th us, the spectre of agrarian distress is a powerful tool with which to justify dam building and other measures focused on the narrow goal of increasing water availability. Th e same dynamics are discerned in the state of Maharashtra, where observers highlight how the construction of large irrigation infrastructures  … is an enterprise between businesses and politicians  ( that )  has nothing to do with water availability especially for the poor. Examples where the poor got water from a dam are very ,  very rare. Th ey do exist ,  I don ’ t say that they don ’ t exist at all. But if you compare them with the number of dams that we have ,  and the slogans that we ’ ve been giving for the past 50 years ,  it doesn ’ t hold ground at all . (Interview with researcher-activist on Indian water manage-ment, January 2015) 112 Z.P. Bharucha Th e establishment of these infrastructures dovetails with the ‘lock in’ of a relatively water-intensive agricultural commodity complex which, over time, has actively impeded resilience by displacing drought-adapted crops and established livelihoods. In Maharashtra, traditionally prosperous oil-seed-dominant agroecosystems have fl ourished within water- limited con-ditions. Yet at present: ‘ [O]f the 16 , 000 ha expected of oilseed ,  only 2000 ha are actually cultivated. So much oilseed has just not been planted. Instead ,  they are cultivating sugarcane because of the sort of security that the sugar factories give them. Th ere is no such security when it comes to oilseed ’ (interview with researcher-activist on Indian water management, January 2015).  Finally, new evidence on the sustainable intensifi cation of agriculture shows the remarkable outcomes that can be achieved in rainfed dryland landscapes where green water, soil health, and biodiversity are well man-aged by local communities themselves. Rainfed dryland communities which have focused on ‘dry’ issues (Rockström et al.  2010 ) have seen huge increases in productivity and resilience. Th e Sahel provides a partic-ularly powerful example. Here, some three million hectares of previously degraded land have been improved through a combination of soil conser-vation and the cultivation of some 120 million trees. In the mid-1980s, restrictive policies prohibited farmers from managing trees on their own lands; this was accompanied by creeping land degradation. Th e relaxation of these policies, coupled with the promotion of agroforestry, has seen farmers actively managing so-called fertilizer trees on their lands (Pretty and Bharucha  2014 ; Pretty et al.  2011 ). Farmers plant nitrogen-fi xing species (e.g.  Faidherbia albida ) on and around cereal fi elds, and com-munity groups have implemented small-scale water harvesting to capture rainwater and improve soil moisture. A stream of positive externalities has emerged, including aquifer recharge, improved soil health, and improved availability of fi rewood fodder and other non-timber products. In all, the ‘Green Wall of the Sahel’ has resulted in substantial increases in food pro-duction—some 500,000 additional tonnes of food per year (Reij et al.  2009 ). Similarly, in Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique, Cameroon, and Zambia, cereal production has increased from fi ve tonnes to eight tonnes over a fi ve-year period (Asaah et al.  2011 ; Ajayi et al.  2011 ; Pretty et al.  2011 ). While the long-term outcomes and political ecologies of these schemes need to be explored in further detail, these examples  nevertheless 4 Scarcity and Crisis in the Rainfed Drylands of India 113do show the potential of interventions which do not focus solely on increasing water supply. Instead, strategies for sustainable intensifi cation in drylands can generate signifi cant improvements through the manage-ment of soil, green water, and vegetation.  In summary, these diff erent streams of scholarship open up the con-versation about climate, scarcity, and rainfed agriculture. Th ey show that vulnerability is not as tightly bound to the climate, and specifi cally to declining rainfall, as the dominant narrative in India suggests. Th ere is much potential for an ‘opening up’ of land and water management beyond simple technical measures to increase water availability. Perhaps ironically, the importance of this ‘opening up’ will only  increase  as cli-mate change advances and climatic pressures become increasingly imme-diate. As this occurs, it will be ever more important for rainfed farmers to have a well-developed and diverse suite of options to maintain all-round  social- ecological resilience.      Going Forward  Th is chapter discussed the prevailing paradigm governing land and water management in the rainfed drylands of India. Assumptions of naturalized scarcity as the primary driver of agrarian distress have coloured both con-ventional and well-regarded alternatives such as WSD. Th ough integrated, community-scale management was initially meant to strengthen rainfed cultivation, evidence on its outcomes and critical analysis of stakeholders’ narratives show that WSD is embedded within the very same paradigm as conventional ‘business as usual’ irrigation management in India. Across both irrigated and rainfed landscapes, the prevailing vision valorizes water availability as the primary criterion of water management, increasing supply of blue water to cultivate relatively water-intensive and lucrative crops. For farmers working in rainfed landscapes, however, this does not enable resilience over time. Instead, short-term spikes in productivity and incomes precede the return of a narrative of water scarcity (Bharucha et al.  2014 ). Th e continued attribution of these outcomes to rainfall means that potentially useful management measures, such as introducing rules on cropping patterns and limiting well-digging, are not implemented. 114 Z.P. Bharucha At the time of writing, the state of Maharashtra is once again faced with the prospect of dry spells aff ecting the rainfed cotton crop. It has been reported that the government is considering employing a private agency to undertake cloud-seeding to encourage rainfall (Economic Times  2015 ). So, both the spectre of scarcity and the supposed saviours of increased rainfall (or more blue water) are still powerfully in play. With increased concern about global climate change, the intensity and variability of the Indian monsoon are both likely to be exacerbated, as are regional dispari-ties between water-abundant and drier areas (Roy  2006 ). It would be easy to conclude that while the impact of climatic factors has thus far been overstated, it should now be at the front and centre of the conversation. And yet, it is quite clear that dryland communities are ‘double-exposed’—vulnerable on two fronts, to both climate change and the imperatives of capricious markets (O’Brien et al.  2004 ). Th e received wisdom is that both can be navigated if we simply increase the amount of water avail-able. However, eff orts to do so have not only failed to alleviate agrarian distress, but also introduced a whole array of social-ecological perversities that increase vulnerability to climate change when it does occur.  Th e streams of evidence and critical scholarship that have only just been briefl y summarized in this chapter converge to reveal very real opportunities for a genuine transformation towards sustainability and resilience. Th ese bodies of scholarship widen the space between climatic ‘givens’ and outcomes on the ground. In doing so, they reveal the wide array of strategies that may be employed to build social and natural capi-tal over and above the provision of increased water for irrigation. It is time to recommit to forms of governance that build on the long-standing competencies of agricultural communities, and employ them to build resilient rainfed agriculture, rather than chasing the mirage of superabun-dant water in dryland landscapes.

Our starting point is that an understanding of territorial issues is fundamental as part of an inte-grated approach to sectoral issues, and that we need to understand territory as being something more than just the ground surface of an area of land. Territory is more than surface; people are also territo-ries. We make reference to actions that produce social relations and, in that sense, create territories. People create territories as much as ter-ritories create people. Territories and people are therefore inseparable. We emphasize the complexity of socioterritorial relations, and argue         J.  S.   Filho      ((cid:13)) •    B.  M.   Fernandes    •    T.  B.   Cunha      State University of São Paulo (UNESP) ,   Presidente Prudente ,  Brazil     that a  territorialized  understanding is essential when analysing disputes over natural resources and the  processes that produce new territories. Territorial disputes are key when considering power relations through a typology of territories,  meaning that a  multidimensional analysis is required; in a one-dimensional  examination of a territory as simply an area of land, these realities are likely to be overlooked.  As a result, water, land, labour, capital, and social movements are fundamental aspects of territory, which must be considered if we are to understand the confl icts involved in territorial disputes and ter-ritorial development models in both the countryside and urban areas. Understanding these issues is essential when considering how spaces are created within society and examining how diff erent models of produc-tion express antagonistic or converging class interests. Failure to consider the reality of these confl icts limits our understanding of geographical and historical processes.  Th e chapter is organized as follows: fi rst, we undertake a multi-scale reading of territories as a whole that allows us to identify power relations which are often obscured when the concept of “territory” is only consid-ered in terms of the biophysics of the earth’s surface. Next, we discuss water-related confl ict across Brazil and the formation of the Brazilian Movement of Dam-Aff ected People (MAB). Finally, we assess the con-cept of “agro-hydro-business” ( agrohidronegócio ), applying our analysis to the case of a project to transfer water from the São Francisco River in Brazil’s Northeast Region.      Territorial Disputes and Confl ictualities  Th e term “territory” is most often used to refer to the land surface of a country, or part thereof. However, this understanding of territory as simply state land can limit our understanding of the multidimensional, multi-scalar, and diverse nature of a given territory. With this in mind, Fernandes ( 2009 ) presents a typology of territories which aims to move beyond a vision of the governance of space and the separation between subject and space. According to this analysis, territory is produced or created by the actions or relationships of those who inhabit the territory. 124 J.S. Filho et al.As the subjects shape the territory, they are also shaped by the territory. Governments create the fi rst territory within a state, which is the space of governance in which people live. Many scholars stop at this point, not venturing to further explore the concept of territory (Fernandes  2013 ).  We propose an exploration of the various territories that exist within the fi rst territory or space of governance. In this chapter, we consider water to be one of these territories, in addition to the land, its inhabit-ants, labour, and capital. Because subjects, relationships, spaces, and territories are undividable, they are multidimensional and multi-scalar; all are territory relations and subjects. Fixed and fl uid territories are produced within the fi rst territory and can be called second and third territories, respectively. Other properties of the nature of territory are materiality and immateriality; ideas, concepts, theories, ideologies, and energies are immaterial territories. Social relationships produce territories and territoriality, and these relationships in turn may also be defi ned by how territories are used. But productive relationships within territories may also destroy and reconstruct territories in a pro-cess of territorial dispute, generating confl ict. Th ese processes are called Territorialization, De-territorialization, and Re-territorialization, or the acronym “TDR” (Fernandes  2009 ).  Th e production of new territories is the result of relationships of power. New territories are produced when subjects intentionally seek to reproduce a certain social relationship. Th e intentionality determines the use of the territory, that is, its territoriality. Each institution, including the state, capital, and the labour force, produces its own territory. In this chapter, we analyse the territorial disputes between diff erent social groups and organizations over land, water, and labour, whose availability are essential conditions for life. Land and water become territories when a particular group or class appropriates these resources and either restricts access to them or allows others to use them. In this case, land refers to any type of property, either public or private, and is a fi xed, or second, territory. A river, on the other hand, would be a fl uid, or third, territory.  However, it is essential to understand that, like nature and society or subject and space, land and water cannot be dichotomized. Social move-ments are themselves socioterritorial interactions that only exist because space and subject are inseparable. Th ese movements are institutions of 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 125organized society in which members participate in meetings with other institutions in order to claim their rights, their land, and their water, such as in meetings with governments, businesses, and so on. Social move-ments exist within specifi c territories, produced by territorialized cultures and economies as forms of spatial management. State and capital also constitute institutions of the management of various territories. Th ese forms of management produce and are produced by economic develop-ment models that are at the service of diff erent social classes. Th e capital-ist development model, for instance, excludes the working class and rural workers, or subordinates these groups to the politico-economic priorities of the dominant classes. As a result, in territories shaped by rural workers, relationships with capitalist corporations are usually avoided so that the processes of exclusion and subordination can be minimized.  Diff erent models of economic development compete for state and national territory, as discussed later in this chapter in relation to several ongoing processes in Brazil, namely the MAB, agro-hydro-business, and the São Francisco River water transfer project. Th e fi rst is a rural workers’ move-ment and the second is an amalgamation of capitalist corporations with state support, which has turned land, water, and people into a business. Th rough these examples, we will show how territorial disputes and develop-ment models produce permanent confl icts, because they promote de-terri-torialization and re-territorialization: a clear example of territorial disputes.  A territory can contain confl icts because it is a power space. Like land, water, and the people who rely on these resources, models of economic development are also territories. When agro-hydro-business appropriates territories, it creates its territoriality through the expropriation of other non-capitalist social relations, such as those involving rural workers, indigenous groups, and Afro-descendants. Th is set of permanent con-fl icts produces a process we call confl ictuality, which shapes confl icts over land, water, labour, methods of production, and class perspectives on the use of territories.  Such a multidimensional perspective allows us to visualize the scales and types of confl icting territories. It helps to overcome the narrow  modern–backwards binary through consideration of the fact that every social rela-tionship has its own time and space and thus produces its own reality. Th erefore, it is not possible to compare the territories of agribusiness with 126 J.S. Filho et al.those of rural workers using elements of one or the other. Each territory is produced by diff erent social relationships, and each social relationship produces a diff erent territory. At the centre of this analysis is labour, which is the main social driving force in the production of territories. Labour, exploited by capital, created and recreated in territories, is a producer of wealth, and wealth is concentrated within corporations. Likewise, unem-ployment and the conditions for expropriation are generated by capital and form socio-spatial and socioterritorial movements. Alienated labour produces socio-spatial movements, bearing in mind that employed work-ers produce and reproduce within the territory of capital; therefore, they do not produce their own territories as small farmers and indigenous groups do, but produce and reproduce capitalist territories. Th e reactions of employees may produce spaces or territories of resistance within capi-tal’s private properties, although these do not constitute their own ter-ritory. Th is is the example of Brazilian Unifi ed Workers Confederation (CUT), the main trade union movement in the country, which repre-sents exploited labour and promotes resistance to capital. As a socio-spatial movement, it produces various resistance territories or spaces, defending workers’ rights. It is important to clarify that workers can create spaces or resistance territories within the territory of capital or the government, that is, within the second or fi rst territory, when they strike, picket the work-place, or use strategies such as work to rule to reduce yield.  Th ese concepts should help us better understand the processes shap-ing the Brazilian countryside, where territories are increasingly subject to disputes between multinational corporations and diff erent types of farmers, triggering the counteroff ensive of socio-spatial and socioterri-torial movements such as trade unions and rural workers’ organizations. Th is idea is important in the next two parts of the text. Th e typology of territory, confl ictuality, and territorial disputes can only be fully under-stood in the context of class struggle and through a critical analysis of the hegemonic model of economic development. Th is perspective chal-lenges the common view of subaltern classes as passive to the initiatives of capital as all the examples studied in this chapter involve resistance to capital or government policies. Workers and small farmers strive for their own spaces and territories, proposing new models where they can act as protagonists.  5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 127    The Struggle for Water and the Movement of Dam-Affected People  Th e Movement of Dam-Aff ected People (MAB) was founded in response to the established Brazilian energy generation model with the aim of creating spaces for struggle and resistance (MAB  2011 ). It has princi-pally been associated with confl icts generated by the implementation of mega-projects, such as the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant (a binational proj-ect between Brazil and Paraguay), which displaced thousands of families in eight districts in the far west of Paraná State in the 1970s (Fernandes  2000 : 65). First reactions to this project came in the form of the Earth and Justice Movement, with support from the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), a branch of the Catholic Church based in the Uruguay River Basin in the southern States of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Th is movement played an important role in the initial formation of the MAB. Th e next step was the creation of the Regional Commission of People Aff ected by Dams, which territorialized the struggle and extended it to Itaparica in northeastern Brazil, 1  specifi cally in response to the build-ing of the Moxotó and Sobradinho dams in the 1970s, with support from the Middle San Francisco Trade Union Hub. 2  In the following decade, the movement was territorialized in Pará, encompassing the struggle and resistance against the Dams and expropriations along the Tocantins River and the formation of the Movement of those Displaced by the Tucuruí Dam and the Commission of People Aff ected by the Tucuruí Dam (CAHTU). In the south, the struggles continued with other territorial-ized movements, such as the campaign against the power plants of Itá on the Uruguay River and Machadinho on the Pelotas River on the border of the States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.  Th ese confl icts were directly related to the national and interna-tional energy crises that followed the oil crisis of 1973. According to Foschiera ( 2009 ), the installation of low-cost hydroelectric power—1   Itaparica is located between the States of Bahia and Pernambuco in the São Francisco basin. 2   Th e Middle San Francisco Trade Union Hub was the main inter-union organization that arranged rural workers of many municipalities of the Meddle São Francisco and the Land Pastoral Commission (CPT) in the 1970s and 1980s. 128 J.S. Filho et al.low-cost in relation to the amount of energy generated—fi nanced by the Brazilian government (usually with the assistance of foreign loans) aimed to provide the country with the infrastructure needed to achieve its capitalist goals, such as producing metal. However, while these projects were cheap in monetary terms, more than one million people were negatively aff ected by the dams. As a result, the dam projects pro-voked numerous reactions and territorialized struggles that emerged simultaneously with other socioterritorial movements in the country, such as the Landless Workers Movement (MST), which was offi  cially established in 1984, although it had existed unoffi  cially since 1979 (Fernandes  2000 ).  Socioterritorial movements such as the MST and the CUT had their roots in the political uprisings that took place during Brazil’s military dic-tatorship (1964–1985). Th is is also the case of the MAB, which came into existence during this period, even though it was not offi  cially established until 1991. Foschiera ( 2009 ) explains that the fi rst National Conference of Workers Aff ected by Dams took place in 1989, and it was there that the decision was taken to build an organization on a national scale. It was not until 1991 that this organization was offi  cially established; the fi rst National Congress of People Aff ected by Dams 3  was held in Brasilia on 12–14 March of that year. 4  At this fi rst meeting, the group discussed the large-scale dams being built and the impacts of their construction on local areas and populations. Th e MAB Congress took place during a period of democratic advances in Brazil, following the establishment of the Federal Constitution of 1988, which had made it easier for the government to make policy decisions and enact changes. However, the land question remained one of the greatest constitutional problems for the working classes, and government policy remained repressive, with calls for change restricted to the socioterritorial combative movements. 3   According to  A Enchente do Uruguai  [Th e Flood of Uruguay], the Congress was attended by over 200 participants from diff erent entities, including representatives of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), Workers’ Party (PT), Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B), and Democratic Labour Party (PDT). Th e Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) sent a letter of solidarity. 4   It was also decided that the 14th of March would be marked annually as the National Day of Action Against Dams. 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 129Moreover, following the election of a new government in 1990 with a clear neoliberal manifesto, Brazilian markets were opened to imports and privatization. Th e government maintained strong ties with large estate owners, who tended to be hostile to agrarian reform policies, resulting in an environment hostile to family agriculture. Th is marked a new chapter in the struggle for land in Brazil, leading the movement to intensify its protests and calls for the mobilization of aff ected people. Th e book  A Enchente do Uruguai  [Th e Flood of Uruguay] presents an analysis of the Congress in the context of this process and the resulting space of political socialization. According to the book, the following demands were put forward during the Congress:•    Agriculture policy: crop markets with guaranteed minimum prices, agricultural insurance, and special credit guarantees for small and medium farmers;  •   Droughts: emergency credit for farmers aff ected by droughts, release of blocked funds without adjustment and extension of fi nancing, as well as the expansion of the Feaper insurance programme;  •   Agrarian reform problems: settlement of 5000 families until 1991, resettlement of families living in tent camps, credit channels, and tech-nical assistance for those already resettled;  •   Health and social security: observation of constitutional retirement rights for rural workers, regularization of the social security system;  •   Energy policy: participation of the working class in energy policymak-ing, resumption of negotiations on dams constructions and the related projects, suspension of work on the Machadinho dam and of the sale of local land, release of public funds blocked by the Collor govern-ment (1990–1992);  •   Education: an end to discrimination against women in textbooks and classrooms, education focused on rural areas, resources for education in tent camps and rural settlements, integrated education centres (CIEPS) in rural areas.     At the end of the Congress, these demands and a transcript of the discussion that took place were published as the  Letter from Brasília . Th e publication of the letter was a historical milestone as it was the fi rst 130 J.S. Filho et al. document to unify the voices of the collective struggle and to express these voices as a list of social demands, pointing to future prospects and helping to forge the identity of the MAB. It was a milestone in the pro-cess of territorialized struggles in Brazil, and a precursor to the general list of demands still used today by the MAB ( 1991 : 8):•    Immediate fulfi lment of agreements reached between the MAB and the energy sector, aimed at remedying the situation of those aff ected by dam construction;  •   Prioritizing resources from the electricity sector to solve the serious social and environmental problems arising from the construction and operation of dams;  •   New dam projects only to be implemented where defi nitive solutions to any resulting social and environmental problems have been agreed;  •   An end to privatization of state-owned power companies, which belong to the Brazilian people;  •   Reform of current energy policies with the participation of those aff ected and wider society;  •   Reform of irrigation policy and public irrigation projects, which should aim to benefi t rural workers;  •   Full respect for the territorial rights of indigenous peoples and imme-diate demarcation of indigenous lands and the lands of  quilombo  com-munities (descendants of African slaves), and wider agrarian reform.     Although these demands have not been met, the fact that an organized movement exists, that the struggle has been acknowledged and the prob-lems have been explicitly questioned, represents a major achievement during this period and an important milestone in the historic process of socioterritorial struggles in Brazil. Th e MAB is also signifi cant for the fact that it addresses major environmental issues as well as the struggle for land, attempting to challenge the destructive agenda of capitalist organi-zations and protesting against the state’s prioritization of development projects at the expense of grassroots interests, traditions, and cultures. Th e creation of the MAB enabled various groups to organize themselves into a unifi ed movement, allowing them to intensify their fi ght and gain visibility both nationally and internationally. 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 131 Th e emergence of the MAB was also important in terms of reinforc-ing the struggle of other socioterritorial movements against capitalist agendas and, above all, demonstrating the need for real energy democra-tization. Th e unifi ed struggle has been grounded in the fact that, histori-cally, the aff ected populations had virtually no say in decisions relating to national energy initiatives, especially with regard to large projects. As part of its fi ght for re-territorialization, the MBA brought together struggles over energy territory, land territory, and water territory, as well as other forms of resistance against corporations; it has now been estab-lished that these struggles are inseparable. MAB fi ghts made explicit the multidimensionality of territorial developments and the class diff erences between rural workers and capitalist interests. Th us, the MAB plays a key role in the struggle for water, which, as well as the struggle for land, is a historic fi ght in Brazil.  Data on water confl icts in Brazil between the years 2002 and 2014 are presented in Fig.  5.1 . Such confl icts result from clashes of interest between rural workers, large-scale farmers, and capitalist corporations, and also relate to the appropriation of dams and lagoons by powerful private interests, resulting in socio-ecological tensions such as water pol-lution, the threat of expropriation, limits on access to fresh water, dis-placement and/or inadequate resettlement of rural workers, destruction of historical and cultural interests, and poaching, among others. Th e data used to produce this diagram were systematized and digitally stored by CPT and are presented in the publication  Conﬂ itos no Campo Brasil  [Confl icts in the Brazilian Countryside] (CPT  2014 ).   Th is map shows that confl icts over water take place all over the coun-try, in all states; just like the struggle for land, the struggle for water is a national issue. Th e struggles for land, water, and energy, and also educa-tion, health, housing, and infrastructure, are territorial struggles that com-prise a search for a development model that is not limited to the interests of capital, but prioritizes the needs and interests of the population. While capitalist interests need to control and exclude in order to grow, ordinary Brazilians put demands for social inclusion at the centre of development.  It is clear that the people aff ected by development are reacting, as shown by the increasing number of demonstrations organized by the MAB, illustrated in Fig.  5.2 . Th is graph shows that people are willing to 132 J.S. Filho et al.take action and get involved in mobilization, expressing their political, religious, and ideological beliefs by demonstrating in various diff erent ways, including marches and camps, public hearings, occupations and blockades, building sieges, picketing of bank branches and other public and private buildings and spaces, congregation in public spaces, hunger strikes and fasts, manifestoes, processions, vigils, pamphlets, collective hikes, and even group hugs in symbolic locations.  Fig. 5.1    Brazil—water confl icts 2002–2014 (number of confl icts by municipalities)        5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 133   Th e MAB is the result of diff erent confl ictualities, trajectories, tradi-tions, and regional specifi cities coming together. It is a national move-ment that brings together various practices and strategies, encompassing multiple cultures, political values, and realities. As pointed out by Vainer ( 2002 ), there are common denominators that dialectically refl ect the exis-tence of a collective drive, building an identity around the phrase “ I am someone who was assaulted ”. Various contexts and ways of life are united by this shared experience, including farmers, fi shermen, riverbank resi-dents, urban dwellers, and so on. Th is unifi ed and unifying fi ght, whose motto is “water for life and not for death”, is also expressed in interactions between the MAB and other socioterritorial movements, 5  especially those involving farmers and smallholders (Table  5.1 ).   Diversity is a key feature of the MAB, be it cultural, political, or socio-territorial, dialectically transcending and articulating scales. In addition, a reality that is multi- and trans-scalar is not restricted to the MAB, but permeates various movements operating at national and international level, such as the MST, the MPA (Small-scale Farmers Movement), the MNCI (National Indigenous Campesino Movement, Argentina), Via Campesina, and so on. Th ese are movements that maintain links with other forms of mobilization and that are diverse because they emerged from diff erent political uprisings in diff erent spaces. Understanding local conditions, cir-cumstances, and socioterritorial relations is fundamental to an understand-ing of each specifi c experience, but in addition, these struggles cannot be understood without considering the historical context and the prerogatives 5   On socioterritorial movements, see Sobreiro Filho ( 2013 ).

It is important to understand that these movements are not monolithic phenomena, but are diverse and also subject to both internal and external pressures from the interaction of political forces at all levels and scales. But, fi rst and foremost, it is a matter of class.      Land–Water–Labour, “Agro-hydro-business”, and Water Transfer from the São Francisco River  In this section, we analyse the project to transfer water from the São Francisco River to other areas in the Northeast Region of Brazil from a perspective of territorial overlap in terms of land, water, and labour issues. Th e project involves the construction of two large-scale channels for transferring water to dry basins in semi-arid inland areas. 6  Our anal-ysis focuses on one of the fundamental rules of the capitalist mode of production, which is that capital should generate more capital through the exploitation of surplus labour (through the extraction of surplus value and the production and movement of goods). Our starting point is the idea that capital is “value in movement” and capital accumula-tion is the process by which value multiplication occurs. Th is can also happen through the private appropriation and economic exploitation of water (Ioris  2010 ).  In our discussion, the concepts of territory and agro-hydro-business are key to enabling us to understand socioterritorial disputes and forms of resistance. Th ese concepts can help us recognize the social dynamics, contradictions, and confl icts of a capitalist society. Territory is perceived through power relations between individuals who are interconnected by various types of material and symbolic relationships. Th e conquest and control of territory is directly related to who has control of natural resources and workers, as demanded by a capitalist economy. 6   Th is region is characterized by low rainfall rates, which, together with intensive land and water management, contribute to high levels of labour exploitation and expropriation of the poor groups in the area. Th is process of socionatural exploitation was established centuries ago through political alliances between the state apparatus and large landholders. Th ese relationships have been reconfi g-ured in recent decades, with the high levels of capital injection from the export of tropical fruits and the building of public dams and irrigation canals. 136 J.S. Filho et al. Th is territorial reading allows us to better comprehend the interven-tions of the Brazilian federal state (particularly in the States of Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, and Pernambuco 7 ), capital dependency relations, the legacy of established social groups, and the use of natural resources. Th e exploitation of labour and ecological degradation, and its association with poor health among workers, are central to understanding the eff ects of land concentration, levels of which are very high in the ter-ritory aff ected by the water transfer project. In this context, the concept of agro-hydro-business is crucial for studying the range of events involved and deconstructing the economic structures and politico- cultural rheto-ric promoted by agribusiness.  Considering that Brazil’s development has relied on the exploitation of natural resources such as water, soil, and biodiversity (a fundamental element of national history), together with the exploitation of labour in the process of capital accumulation and value multiplication, we argue in favour of a critical investigation of confl icts, coalitions, class alliances, and, consequently, the (re)formulation of territories (Ioris  2005 ; Almeida  2010 ). Th e steps of this examination, in addition to the analysis of water transfer from the São Francisco River under the logic imposed by capital, which does not consider human needs, reveal how agro-hydro-business demands coordinated control of land, water, and labour.  In addition, our research focuses on the regime of land use and specu-lation, which is linked to varied land management approaches related to market pressures and developmental priorities, manifested in the commoditization of signifi cant social and ecological features in recent decades. In an eff ort to unpack the circumstantial and structural bar-riers that have led to signifi cant multidimensional and trans-scalar changes in the Northeast Region, we need to consider international interconnections, 8  given that local particularities contain and express global realities (Brandão  2010 ). 7   States (or provinces) that will be benefi ciaries of the water transfer from the São Francisco River. 8   According to Brandão ( 2010 ), the appropriation and expropriation of abundant territorial resources and permanent primitive accumulation are fundamental elements in Brazilian history. Th e fact that Brazil’s national territory is both vast and heterogeneous has allowed the national elites who control it to subordinate the general population. Th e country’s territory has been turned 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 137 Our analysis starts with an historical overview, which is needed to introduce dynamic elements of the region associated with the agricul-tural confi guration and the various forms of state intervention that follow the capitalist order, in which the natural design of the region infl uences the appropriation of nature and associated territorial  management  mechanisms. Implementing the water transfer project required a detailed knowledge of local soils, climate, terrain, vegetation, and water, and of the regional, national, and global political-economic framework. However, in addition to this, the project was driven by class interests and  controlled by formal and informal rules ultimately aimed at the  expansion and  consolidation of capital in the Northeast Region.  It was in 2007, during the second term of President Lula’s administra-tion, that work on the project started, 160 years after Brazilian Emperor Peter II’s manifesto announced the possibility of transferring the waters of the São Francisco River. Th e offi  cial argument in favour of the project focused on water shortages in the region, promising to “quench the thirst” of 12 million living in drought-prone areas and with limited access to surface and groundwater. Key factors infl uencing the project, according to the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) ( 2011 ), included:•    Th e Northeast Region has only 3 % of national water resources but 28 % of the population;  •   Water is also concentrated in some parts of the region and the São Francisco River contains 70 % of regional stocks;  •   Signifi cant disparity in demographic density in the water-receiving areas (to the north of the São Francisco Basin) with 50 inhabitants/km 2 , compared with only 10 inhabitants/km 2  in the source areas;  •   A disparity in water use: 400 m 3 /inhabitant/year in the water-receiving areas (below the threshold of 1500 m 3 /inhabitant/year recommended by the United Nations), compared with 10,000 m 3 /inhabitant/year in the source areas;  into a mere operational base and platform for capital circulation, as well as a locus of human and environmental predation. 138 J.S. Filho et al.•   Most existing dams and storage facilities built on intermittent rivers and/or aquifers with signifi cant limitations in terms of water quality or quantity;  •   Th e water transfer project would only abstract 26.4 m 3 /s from the São Francisco River, representing only 1.4 % of fi rm water fl ow at the Sobradinho Dam (1850 m 3 /s).     Th e data demonstrate the extent of water scarcity in this region, and, in theory, explain the need to transfer water from a more abun-dant area. Th is is a matter of human survival, since without water there is no life. In fact, however, human supply, the goal touted by the state and regional oligarchies, does not seem to be the main objective of the project. Notwithstanding the climatic vagaries of this semi-arid part of Brazil, high levels of land concentration and patriarchal policies at vari-ous scales were also important factors in terms of population expulsion, especially in times of prolonged droughts. Th is explains why the semi- arid region’s population has been the main migratory group in the history of the country. Since the beginning of colonization, populations who, through no fault of their own, lacked access to water and land, have had to migrate to sites with greater abundance and more favourable social perspectives. Despite the fact that the semi-arid region is the most densely populated semi-arid region in the world, and also the most humid, the social vulnerability of the population has always been profoundly linked to the quality and quantity of available water, both of which have been adversely aff ected by high levels of land concentration and precarious labour conditions.  Brazilian state rhetoric has been consistent with a scenario constructed by policies that have aimed to bolster regional oligarchies with infra-structural investments allowing for control of water bodies, concatenated with Brazil’s land concentration, which has been high for centuries. Th e crucial proposal we want to examine is that state discourse is not con-sistent with the concrete reality on the ground, taking into account that the São Francisco River project follows the same pattern of political alli-ances between state and capital and regional oligarchies that has prevailed in Brazil for the last fi ve centuries. Th e water demands proposed in the  project are for the public supply of urban centres, and particularly for 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 139 irrigation and supply to industrial parks that will benefi t powerful groups. Th is fundamental distortion can be seen from the following observations:•    Th ere is a direct relationship between the interests of those involved in the water transfer project and the agenda of some members of the rural committee in the Brazilian National Congress (i.e. deputies and sena-tors representing regional oligarchies, particularly those who own vast tracts of land in areas that will be benefi t from the transfer of water) according to mapping presented by Costa ( 2012 ). Th e rural commit-tee has agreed on the allocation of funding to build several channels that will receive irrigation water from the São Francisco River, includ-ing the Cinturão das Águas in Ceará (R$ 6.8 billion), the Acauã–Araçagi channel in Paraíba (US$ 933 million), the irrigation perimeter of the Santa Cruz dam in Rio Grande do Norte (US$ 145 million), as well as from existing channels (such as the  Trabalhador  [Labourer] Canal in Ceará and Várzeas de Souza in Paraíba). 9   •   Th e promotion of industrial parks is another stated purpose of the water transfer project. Th e Industrial and Port Complex of Pecém, in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza, is an example. It will benefi t from the increased volumes of water to be moved through the Trabalhador Canal, which is already in operation.  •   Policies to address water scarcity in the semi-arid region, particularly in rural areas, are restricted to emergency measures, such as the use of water tanks and the promotion of so-called small hydro-social tech-nologies, such as the construction of water cisterns, underground dams, desalination plants, wells, fountains, and so on. Consequently, for family farmers, demand continues to exceed supply, and the  situation leaves these farmers prey to populist policies, precarious working conditions, disease, forced migration, and so on.  •   Even with its low rainfall levels and climatic irregularities, water avail-ability in the semi-arid part of the Northeast Region is adequate to meet urban public supply demand (ANA  2012 ; IPEA  2011 ); 9   Th rough these channels, the transfer of water could feed irrigation perimeters (14 in the States of Ceará, 5 in Rio Grande do Norte, 3 Paraíba, and 4 in Pernambuco), which is likely to merely (re)produce social inequalities, poisoning/killing workers (see note 11, below) and aff ecting their living conditions, while facilitating the expansion of capitalist relations. 140 J.S. Filho et al. nonetheless, public policies have systematically focused on large hydraulic infrastructure and neglected alternatives; that is, the demands of capital have been prioritized.  •   With all these territorial rearrangements involving agricultural and hydrological issues, the São Francisco River water transfer project appears to be at risk, especially from the drastic decrease in river fl ows over the last three years. Th e minimum fi rm fl ow of the river, according to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), at the withdrawal sites was calculated as 1800 m 3 /s downstream from the Sobradinho dam. However, this fl ow has decreased by 50 % to 900 m 3 /s following long droughts, river basin degradation, and over-abstraction by irrigation. 10      Th e above are examples of how regional agrarian oligarchies seek to monopolize control of waters and lands as a strategy for holding onto power. Th is strategy has been directly linked with alliances and pressures on the state apparatus, as the fi nancier and executor of numerous water projects. In the Brazilian semi-arid region, alliances between large land-owners and the state have played an important role in the formation of alliances with big agribusiness, especially in public irrigation projects that provide water to areas producing mainly for the foreign market. In these areas, an agro-export structure has gradually become consolidated, where increasing the price of rural property allows land rent to be added to the circulation of more signifi cant capital. In this process, control of water is crucial in terms of consolidating political power and facilitating capital accumulation. Th e closer properties are to the agribusiness infrastructure, the higher their market value and the greater the rent exploitation of their land. Higher valuations are thus related to positions in the sociotechnical territory, and favourable locations ensure a faster monetary return, either from speculation or production. 10   Th e Urucuia aquifer, located in the middle portion of the basin, is considered the “lungs of the São Francisco River”, especially during the dry season (from April to September) and is the source of a large portion of the river’s fl ow. However, the doctoral research project entitled “From Hidden to Visible: Earth-Water-Work and Agro-hydro-business Territorial Conglomerates in Western Bahia” (Cunha  2013 ), identifi ed about 1000 central pivots and 2.5 million hectares of cultivated land in aquifer recharge areas. Th is means that the production structure based on large-scale agri-business has contributed signifi cantly to reducing the fl ow in the São Francisco River. 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 141 Th ere is a clear and long-established class alliance underpinning this supposedly “modern” productive structure. Perhaps one of the novel aspects of agribusiness in the São Francisco Basin is the infl uence of the global fi nancial system. In this current phase of capitalism, the agricul-ture practised in the territories of agro-hydro-business is dominated by this class alliance between large corporations, land owners, the state, and capital. Crucially, agribusiness corporations 11  control inputs, machinery, the seed trade, and bank credit, while landowners speculate or use their land for production. A study carried out by the National Secretariat of the MST, using information published in the magazine  Exame  ( 2013 ), revealed that the 50 largest agribusiness companies accounted for 70 % of Brazil’s agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) (R$ 600 billion).  Th e agrarian social structure, while contributing directly to production and lucrative fi nancial results, has also led to socio-environmental degra-dation due to the lack of regulation of how large-scale landowners con-trol labour and natural resources (water and soil are the most important strategically). Agribusiness players always try to expand profi t through various mechanisms in parallel with the downward trend of the use value of goods so as to encourage the production cycle and increase profi t rates. With this in mind, it is possible to better understand the confi guration of large capitalist enterprises in Brazil’s rural sector, whether in terms of technical or social relationships (Delgado  2012 ; Antunes  1999 ).  At the same time, the Brazilian government has chosen primary com-modities as its main export sector in an attempt to expand the coun-try’s presence in foreign markets, and has privileged its economic, strategic, and logistical interests, resulting in exclusionary policies that have amplifi ed social inequalities, property concentration, and income and power asymmetries at various scales (Th omaz  2008 ). With growing  socio- environmental impacts aff ecting the majority of the working class, control of land, water, and labour by capital is a central aspect of territo-rial dynamics in the areas of infl uence of the São Francisco River water transfer project. 12  11   Th e ten largest agribusiness corporations in operation in Brazil are: JBS, Raízen (Cosan e Shell), Cosan, Bunge, BRF, Cargill, Marfrig, Nestlé, Copersucar, and Louis Dreyfuss. 12   Raquel Rigotto, medicine professor at the Federal University of Ceará, has conducted research in the State of Ceará on irrigation perimeters that receive water from the São Francisco water transfer 142 J.S. Filho et al. Th e offi  cial rhetoric that agribusiness is the fundamental driving force of national exports, responsible for contributing massively to the Brazilian trade balance, says nothing about the confl icts and exploitative scenarios in areas that will receive water from the São Francisco River, where slave- like  13  labour, disputes over water and land, exposure of workers to toxic substances, water pollution, and serious river degradation are rife (Lima  2006 ; Rigotto  2013 ). Furthermore, the consequences of the project will not only aff ect the areas where it is directly focused; they are also likely to aff ect a range of territories, threatening long-established interactions between human beings and the rest of nature. Evidences of that are the excessive use of water for irrigation, production of soft fruits for export, and contamination by pesticides and chemical fertilizers, among others.  Th ese critical refl ections are based on the analytical link between agrarian questions, labour struggles, and water disputes involving the expansion of productive forces and conditions. Land grabbing by foreign businesses is another element of this process, and has led to a signifi cant change in the meaning of production relations as it deepens capitalist control of rural properties, water stocks, and the workforce. According to the National Secretariat of the MST, foreign companies already control about 60 % of Brazilian agricultural GDP. Th e foundations of agrarian policies in the Northeast Region and in the rest of Brazil are directly associated with the requirements of large transnational conglomerates at the expense of feasible alternatives for the emancipation of local workers. Large water infrastructure, as exemplifi ed by the water transfer project, basically exists to strengthen the mechanisms of private capital accumula-tion (Th omaz  2012 ).  Confl icts over water, land, and labour are inherent in the progress of capital, particularly in the activities of the export-oriented economic model, based on widespread commodifi cation and a progressive control of territories and the production chain. Th is is something that intensifi es project that has detected signifi cant poisoning of workers by chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Th e researcher identifi es severe threats to the health and life of these workers, including carcinoma, genetic disorders, and acute contamination, among others. 13   Th ere are circumstances that, according to the Brazilian Penal Code, bear a resemblance to slavery situations, given serious human degradation, violation of basic rights, unacceptable health and live risks, long working days, forced work due to debts, and so on. 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 143over time, with increasing contributions from new and more damaging elements. Slave labour, intense confl icts, and even murder have become part of the daily lives of people in the semi-arid region, both established groups and newcomers who came to the region to participate in the con-struction of irrigation perimeters 14  (see Fig.  5.3 ).   Th e struggles for control of land and water are inextricably linked. Th ese are natural goods needed for the practices of everyday life, but transformed into resources by economic demands. Since water is increas-ingly understood as a commodity, it becomes a tool for value promotion and the protagonist of the advance of capital in the countryside, directly or indirectly, whatever the activity. Th is cyclical dynamics, fuelled in large part by the exploitation of unpaid labour, is intrinsic to the survival of capital. A comparison between the two most recent sets of fi gures shows an increase in confl icts over water, especially in areas of progress or capital consolidation in the Brazilian northeast. In the semi-arid areas that will be aff ected by the São Francisco River project, but also in more humid coastal zones, water control demonstrates elements of the prevailing socio-economic model. 14   According to the CPT, the main organization in charge of collecting confl ict data, there has been a growing number of incidents over the last decade, especially in the territories of primary com-modity exports, including agribusiness, hydropower sites, roads and railways, mining, and so on.   Fig. 5.3    Project axes, pipelines, and water confl icts 2002–2014        144 J.S. Filho et al. We conclude this section by stating that we are not opposed to tradi-tional interventions such as water diversion, especially for regions with negative water balance, limited water reserves, and high rates of evapo-transpiration (which favours salinization). However, what we advocate are genuine changes in policymaking in the pursuit of decentralization, with more democratic and less bureaucratic forms of management, which would treat nature and territory as common goods. Th is would represent a possible way forward based on water as a substantial element for life and a protagonist in issues of land and agriculture. We also propose an alter-native path of development in which social movements are understood as central institutions for building and managing these changes, prioritizing human and non-human nature rather than capital accumulation.      Conclusions  In this chapter, we briefl y refl ected on diff erent types of territory and presented a critical interpretation going beyond the perspective of under-standing territory as synonymous with power on a given piece of the earth’s surface. We presented a territorial reading of land and water from the perspective of disputes over diff erent development models and explored the territories produced by diff erent social relations. Th is high-lighted the multiple dimensions associated with the conceptualization of water as a disputed territory. Th e chapter included a historical overview of the formation of the MAB and the various confl icts over water in Brazil, focusing on the complex and confl ictive process associated with the transfer of water from the São Francisco River, occurring alongside the advancement of national and international agro-hydro-business.  Moreover, based on the evidence and empirical data presented above, we aimed to move the debate beyond superfi cial readings of the historical issue of water and land in Brazil. Discussing the territorial advances of capital supported by the Brazilian government, we see that examination of confl icts is essential if we are to understand the uneven balance of power between socioterritorial movements and agro-hydro-business, as well as the contradictions generated by the latter. Struggles and resistance on the ground, such as resistance by the MAB, are an important process 5 Water, Land and Socionatural Movements in Brazil 145of contestation and socioterritorial dispute, and exemplify the contest for popular participation in state actions, fi ghting for the recognition of the rights and interests of those aff ected by state projects. Th e emergence of the MAB as a national organization is a milestone not only in terms of denouncing confl ict and providing a voice of resistance for the people aff ected by agro-hydro-business, but also in how it has taken the fi rst steps in terms of public policy proposals and challenging the state. Th e logic of this approach, based on a reading of the confl ict, is also intended to deconstruct the actions of the state, removing obstacles to clarity and working to eliminate confl icts and social, economic, cultural, environ-mental, and political problems, as well as the exploitation of state facili-ties and public policy by agro-hydro-business. Th e São Francisco River project is an emblematic example of this confl ictive process promoted by agro-hydro-business in Brazil because it is characterized by public policies misrepresented by the state as “social development”, while its main pur-pose is in fact to serve the interests of capital. Incidentally, the discourse against the simplifi cation of “social development” reveals the profusion of confl icts, the precariousness of labour relations, environmental degra-dation, the expropriation of rural worker, the appropriation of land and water by oligarchs, and so on.  In conclusion, water, land, socioterritorial movements, labour, and capital are important components of the current confl ictuality in Brazil, generated by the dispute between diff erent models of territorialized eco-nomic development. Th is multidimensional reading, multi-scale and diverse on the concept of territory, also allows us to scale up the confl icts and unpack the rationales behind existing territorial disputes. Moreover, we believe that a key contribution of this text is to foster debate and new refl ections and dialogues on confl ictualities and territorial disputes, and also to promote a critical use of the concept of territory in geography and other sciences.      146 J.S.

Fruits and veg-etables are rich sources of micronutrients, needed by children for optimal growth and development. Most national and international dietary guide-lines are in agreement that consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables is 1   Th e author thanks Maggie Gill and Antonio Ioris for their insightful comments and suggestions to previous versions of this chapter. 2   Ruel et al. ( 2004 ) defi ne fruits as the sweet, fl eshly, edible parts of plants that contain the seed(s), excluding non-sweet examples such as zucchini, tomatoes, peppers, and peas.         D.  M.S.

Th e World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum daily intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables, especially for children, and many coun-tries have programmes to promote consumption (FAO/WHO  2004 ).   Several initiatives have recognized the importance of the consumption of fruits and vegetables in avoiding micronutrient defi ciencies. One of these is the Global Fruit and Vegetable for Health Initiative (PROFAV/PROFEL), launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WHO, in 2003. Th is was followed by the Framework for Action in 2004, the objective of which was to guide the development of cost- eff ective interventions to promote adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables for health at national or sub-national level (FAO/WHO  2004 ). However, according to Ruel et al. ( 2004 ), families around the world still tend to spend a relatively low percentage of their food budget on fruits and vegetables (between 4 % and 16 %).  In addition to increasing demand, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ( 1996 ) cites several reasons for the expansion of the global fruit trade, namely: (1) eff orts by developing countries to increase the value of their exports after a fall in production of tropical commodities during the 1980s; (2) increases in trade liberalization; (3) diversifi cation of production in response to agricultural policy reform, reductions in subsidies, and increases in fruit supply in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; and (4) technical progress in storage and trans-port. On the other hand, even though some national  governments around 010020030040050060070019611963196519671969197119731975197719791981198319851987198919911993199519971999200120032005200720092011Million tonnesYears  Fig. 6.1    World fruit production between 1961 and 2011 (FAOSTAT)        150 D.M.S. Felicianothe globe have incorporated the concepts of sustainability, climate change adaptation, and social participation into their policies, these aspects are frequently not implemented due to the pressure for economic growth (Ioris  2011 ). Th erefore, the expansion in fruit production and the increased con-tribution of fruits to international trade can lead to social and environ-mental overexploitation in producing countries. According to Basset-Mens et al. ( 2014 ), fruits, as well as other foods produced and traded globally, are increasingly coming under scrutiny because of their environmental impacts. For example, it can limit access to water resources, cause food insecurity in producing regions, or force small-scale producers out of business. Other eff ects of increased fruit production include soil erosion; the introduction of genetically modifi ed organisms, which are not always accepted by the society; monoculture expansion; and control of production by multina-tionals focused on supplying goods to developed countries.  Given the fact that, according to FAOSTAT (the database made avail-able by the Statistics Division of the FAO), Brazil is the third largest pro-ducer of fruits in the world and the lead supplier of concentrated orange juice (85 % of total world exports), it is important to conduct an initial analysis as to how the environment has been aff ected to further identify potential negative social eff ects. Th is industry is of growing importance for the Brazilian economy, with an export value of around US$ three billion in 2012 (data from FAOSTAT). Brazil has indeed great potential for food production given its size, the diversity of its climatic conditions, and the strategic seasonal timing of its harvests. Th e existence of diff er-ent climates within the country means that both tropical and temperate fruit types can be produced, and allows for year-round fruit production (Faveret Filho et al.  n.d. ). Temperate fruits are harvested at diff erent times of year from the harvest period in the Northern Hemisphere, thus pre-senting an opportunity to sell the Brazilian production in these mar-kets. Of all the regions in Brazil, the State of São Paulo is the main fruit producer, responsible for 43 % of total fruit production in the country. Th e European Union is the largest market for Brazilian fruits, importing 70 % of the total amount of fruits exported. About half of the exports go directly to the Netherlands before being distributed to other countries in the European Union, such as the UK, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (Faveret Filho et al.  n.d. ). 6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 151 Th e objective of this chapter is to analyse the impacts of increasing fruit production on Brazil’s natural resources (water and land in par-ticular) and its contribution to climate change. It aims at improving the understanding on how the demand for food production in Europe can displace environmental impacts to other countries, using Brazil as a case study.  Th is analysis will follow the ‘nexus’ approach, 3  which is essential when looking for solutions to optimize interdependencies and support the equitable and sustainable allocation of resources in a context of increasing competition in the water, energy, and food sectors. Because issues in the water, energy, and food sectors are often treated in isolation by regional and national government institutions, the ‘nexus’ approach can better help stakeholders to identify and understand the risks to food, energy, and water security.      Fruit Production in Brazil  Fruit production has been increasing rapidly in Brazil since 1961 (Fig.  6.2 ). Th e main fruits produced in 2013 were oranges, bananas, and pine-apple (Fig.  6.3 ).    Diop and Jaff ee (2005) examined the factors responsible for the ini-tial growth and subsequent maturation in production levels for some of the developing world’s leading producers of fresh and processed fruits, including Brazil. Th ese authors found that the initial increase in pro-duction occurred during a period of stable macroeconomic conditions which created a favourable environment for investment. In addition to this, the modernization of Brazilian agriculture and the technical progress in storage and transport also contributed to the increase in production. Important initial catalysts for export growth included sud-den shortfalls (demand greater than supply) in major overseas markets, 3   Th e ‘nexus’ is an increasingly recognized concept and is about how and where the food, water, and energy systems intersect. Because actions related to one system can impact one or both of the other systems, it is necessary to take a nexus approach. Underlying the nexus approach is the understand-ing of the interdependencies among these three systems and how to ensure food, water, and energy security for an ever-growing population. 152 D.M.S.

International technical and marketing partnerships also provided a vehicle for the transfer of tech-nology, for new market penetration, and for creating an identity for the products being exported. 0500010000150002000025000300003500019614000019641967197019731976197919821985198819911994199720002003200620092012Fresh weight in thousands tonnes   Fig. 6.2    Fruit production (excluding melons) in Brazil between 1961 and 2013 ( Source : FAOSTAT)       Oranges44%Bananas17%Pineapples6%Watermelons5%Cashew apple5%Papayas4%Grapes4%  Fig. 6.3    Fruits produced in Brazil in 2013 (%) ( Source : FAOSTAT)         6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 153 About 80 % of Brazil’s oranges are grown in what is known as the ‘citrus belt’, covering some regions of São Paulo State and part of the  Triangulo Mineiro  (Mineiro Triangle, in the State of Minas Gerais). In general terms, around 30 % of national production is consumed inter-nally, while 70 % is turned into juice for export (Bellingieri et al.  2012 ). In 2012, 86 % of the oranges produced in São Paulo were destined for the juice processing industry, with only 14 % destined for fresh con-sumption (Neves  2010 ). Brazil is the world’s largest juice exporter, con-trolling 85 % of the global market, with 70 % of juice exports from Brazil destined for Europe (Neves  2010 ). In 2010, the citrus produc-tion chain generated 230,000 jobs in the country, with around 77,000 directly linked to the cultivation of oranges and 7000 linked to the orange juice processing industry (Neves  2010 ). Th e ‘citrus agribusiness complex’, implemented in the 1960s and 1970s, forced all aspects of the orange production industry (from production to processing) to become interdependent, especially in the case of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ), where decisions about volume, quality, and fruit origin aff ect all stages of the production process (Borges  2004 ).  Using the variable fruit supply from the food balance sheets of FAOSTAT as a proxy for fruits consumed, it is possible to observe 020406080100120140160196119631965196719691971197319751977197919811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013kcal/capita/day  Fig. 6.4    Fruit supply in Brazil between 1961 and 2013 in kcal per capita per day ( Source : FAOSTAT)        154 D.M.S. Felicianoonly a slight increase in terms of kilocalories (kcal) per capita per day since 1961 (Fig.  6.4 ). It should be noted that food supply is the total quantity of foodstuff s produced in a country (minus waste on the farm and during distribution and processing), added to the total quantity imported, and adjusted for any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period. Per capita food supply is then obtained by dividing the resulting quantity by the related data on population. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity.   According to Sustainable Planet, 4  of the 20 main fruits consumed in Brazil, only three are Brazilian in origin (i.e. were already in Brazil before European colonization), which means that the country has probably a reduced biological diversity of those plant species. Table  6.1  presents the main fruits consumed in Brazil according to their place of origin and importance in daily consumption.   Brazil also exports much of the fruits consumed in Europe and the USA (see Box  6.1 ). Fruit exports from Brazil can be divided into processed (coconuts, oranges, tangerines, mandarins, clementines, satsumas, lemons and limes, grapefruit, pears, quinces, cherries) and unprocessed fruits (orange juice, dried fi gs, canned pineapple, cooked fruits, sugar- preserved fruits, concentrated juice). Fruit exports by Brazil increased continuously between 1962 and 2007, with a slight decrease between 2007 and 2011 (Fig.  6.5 ). Th e main fruit items exported are ‘processed fruits’ (single strength and concentrated juice) and the main 4   www.planetasustentavel.com.br    Table 6.1    Main fruits consumed in Brazil    Brazilian origin  Other origin  Unknown origin  Pineapple (2nd), Guava (7th) Passion fruit (12th)  Avocado (1st), Banana (3rd), Persimmon (4th), Fig (6th), Orange (8th), Lemon (9th), Papaya (10th), Quince (13th), Apple (14th), Watermelon (15th), Melon (16th), Pear (17th), Peach (17th), Tangerine (19th), Grapes (20th)  Bahia coconut (5th)    Source : Sustainable Planet  6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 155unprocessed fruits exported are melon, mangoes, mangosteens and gua-vas, bananas, and oranges. According to Coltro et al. ( 2009 ), the major-ity of the oranges produced in Brazil (70 %) are processed into FCOJ by large processing companies. Th e FCOJ produced is mainly exported to Europe (70 %) and the USA (15 %) (Neves  2010 ). Th is makes Brazil the world’s largest producer and exporter of FCOJ. Brazilian orange production accounts for half the world’s supply of orange juice and 80 % of the juice traded on the international market (Coltro et al.  2009 ).    05001000150020002500300019611963196519671969197119731975197719791981198319851987198919911993199519971999200120032005200720092011Fresh weight in thousands tonnes  Fig. 6.5    Fruit exports (processed and unprocessed) between 1961 and 2012 in thousand tonnes ( Source : FAOSTAT)         Box 6.1 Brazil in the world market for orange juice  The world market for orange juice used to be a duopolistic market struc-ture, with only two players, the USA (mainly Florida) and Brazil, which supplied around 85 % of the world market. Over 95 % of Brazil’s produc-tion was exported, whereas more than 95 % of US orange juice was consumed domestically. Of the US imports of concentrated orange juice, some 90 % came from Brazil. Imported orange juice was mixed with US juice to improve its colour and make up for seasonal shortfalls in supply. In the early 1990s, Brazilian producers began to invest directly in the  156 D.M.S. Feliciano    Environmental Impacts  In this study, fi ve components of the Rockström et al.’s ( 2009 ) plan-etary boundaries framework were considered (climate change, the nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P] cycles, global freshwater use, and land use) to investigate the environmental impacts of fruit produc-tion in Brazil. Waste production and energy use were also considered since the relatively short shelf-life of fresh fruits exacerbates the impact of fruit production on water, land, energy, and climate change. Th e planetary boundaries framework (Rockström et al.  2009 ) defi nes the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth system and its biophysical subsystems (or processes), namely, climate change, biodiversity loss, the N and P cycles, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidifi cation, global freshwater use, land use, atmospheric aero-sol loading, and chemical pollution.     Freshwater Use  According to Mekonnen and Hoekstra ( 2011 ), Brazil is the coun-try with the fourth-highest water footprint (482 Gm 3 /y) after China (1207 Gm 3 /y), India (1182 Gm 3 /y), and the USA (1053 Gm 3 ∕y). In addition, the catchment of the Parana River, which is the second-longest Florida industry, acquiring as much as 40 % of the Florida processing industry. The US presence in Brazil’s citrus industry started in the 1960s, when winter freezes prompted US growers to look to Brazil for planting (Thunder Lake Management 2002 cited by Diop and Jaffee  2005 ). According to Neves ( 2010 ), 35 European juice packing companies buy 80 % of the juice exported from Brazil, while in the USA, the four big-gest companies dominate 75 % of the market. Juice packing companies prefer to pack juice that provides a higher profi t margin, which means they bargain to lower the prices of the raw material (concentrated juice). Therefore, the higher the price of orange juice, the more it will lose market share to other juices such as apple, pear, peach, and so on (Bellingiere et al.  2012 ). 6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 157river in South America (obviously, after the Amazon) and includes most of the State of São Paulo, is the fi fth-highest river catchment in water footprint after the Mississippi, Ganges, Yangtze, and Indus. Th e average water footprint per tonne of primary crop diff ers signifi cantly between crops and across production regions. Global average water footprints of selected fruits and their derived products were assessed by Mekonnen and Hoekstra ( 2011 ) and are presented in Table  6.2 . Th e water footprint per tonne (m 3  tonne −1 ) is the sum of the  green ,  blue , and  grey  water footprints.

Th e water footprint by fruit type is obtained by multiplying the sum of the water footprints for each water type by the amount (in tonnes) of each fruit type produced in Brazil (Fig.  6.6 ).    As shown in Fig.  6.6 , the production of oranges (fresh fruits produced in tonnes) contributed the most for water footprint in 2013, followed by the production of bananas.  Although the total water footprint for pineapple is low when com-pared with the water footprint of oranges, the production of this item is increasing fast in the past 30 years (Fig.  6.7 ). Th erefore, if this rate of production is maintained, there will be a signifi cant impact on fresh-water resources. According to Neves ( 2010 ), demand for irrigation has been increasing signifi cantly since the 1990s. Data from the FAOSTAT database confi rm that the area of agricultural land under irrigation has doubled in Brazil between 1990 (~1 % of total agricultural land) and 2013 (~2 % of total agricultural land).020,00,00040,00,00060,00,00080,00,0001,00,00,0001,20,00,000Thousands m3TotalGreen waterBlue waterGrey water  Fig. 6.6    Water footprints due to fruit production in Brazil in 2013 (in  thousand m 3 ) ( Source : Own calculations)        6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 159       Freshwater Eutrophication  Eutrophication is the response of the ecosystem to the addition of natu-ral or artifi cial substances such as phosphates to freshwater systems. A negative eff ect of this response includes hypoxia, which is the depletion of oxygen in the water, causing the death of fi sh and other aquatic ani-mals. Fruit production can contribute to eutrophication through the application of phosphates, nitrates, and potash in mineral fertilizer. Th e International Fertilizer Industry Association provides activity data on N, phosphate (P 2 O 5 ), and potash (K 2 O) application in mineral fertil-izer in Brazilian fruit production in 2011. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association website, 5  in 2011, 157,000 tonnes of N were applied to fruit production areas in Brazil (International Fertilizer Industry Association), as well as 88,000 tonnes of phosphate and 152,000 tonnes of potash (Fig.  6.8 ).   From Table  6.2 , it can be seen that mango and guava production and apple drying are major contributors to the grey water footprint (volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing environment water quality standards).

According to Abe et al. ( 2008 ), more eutrophic reservoirs have higher diff usive fl uxes of GHG when compared with less eutrophic reservoirs.       Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions  Th e main sources of GHG emissions in fruit production prior to the farm gate are associated with mineral N and manure application to soils, cultivation of organic soils, decomposition and burning of crop residues, and energy used in fruit production. Th e main source of statistics used in our discussion, FAOSTAT, presents emissions data for each source type, but does not disaggregate the data by type of agricultural product, only providing the total for crop production (Fig.  6.10 ). Th e application of N causes direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, as the availabil-ity of N infl uences nitrifi cation and denitrifi cation reactions. N 2 O is a powerful GHG with a global warming potential of 298 (1 tonne of N 2 O corresponds to 298 tonnes of carbon dioxide [CO 2 ] equivalent) over a 100-year period.05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000196119641967197019731976197919821985198819911994199720002003200620092012Gigagrams CO2equivalentDirect emissionsIndirect emissionsTotal emissions  Fig. 6.10    Greenhouse gas emissions from synthetic fertilizer application in Brazil between 1961 and 2012 in gigagrams of CO 2  equivalent ( Source : FAOSTAT)        162 D.M.S. Feliciano   Note that FAOSTAT calculates emissions from synthetic fertilizer in crop production using data from the Fertilizer Archive dataset (1961–2001) and calculated data (2002–2050), but does not disaggregate the data by crop type. According to these estimates, total GHG emissions from synthetic fertilizer application have been increasing rapidly since 2003, and the prediction for 2030 and 2050 is a continuation of this rapid rate of increase (Fig.  6.10 ).  Th e increase in GHG emissions in agriculture is not only caused by an increase in the production area as total emissions from synthetic fertilizer application per hectare of crop produced has also increased in the past ten years, suggesting the amount of synthetic fertilizer applied per hectare has increased (Fig.  6.11 ).   GHG emissions due to the application of synthetic fertilizer in Brazilian fruit production were estimated in terms of tonnes of CO 2  equivalent emitted per kilogram of fertilizer applied. GHG emissions caused by syn-thetic (N) fertilizer application can be estimated by using Tier 1 meth-ods 6  from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. According to the 6   Tier 1 methods are actual emission estimation methods, often based on default activity data where better data are not available. 0.000.050.100.150.200.250.3019992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012Tonnes CO2 eq per haYear  Fig. 6.11    Greenhouse gas emissions from the application of synthetic fertil-izer in Brazil per hectare of area harvested in tonnes of CO 2  equivalent per hectare ( Source : FAOSTAT)        6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 163International Fertilizer Industry Association website, 7  157,000 tonnes of N were applied in fruit-producing areas of Brazil in 2011; using IPCC equations (see Eggleston et al.  2006 ) to estimate direct and indirect emis-sions from N application, the result obtained is 974 thousand tonnes (~1 gigagram) of CO 2  equivalent emitted in fruit production in 2011. To add to CO 2  emissions from fertilizer application, there are the emissions due to the production of synthetic fertilizer and transportation of this same fertilizer. Th e world factor of GHG emissions for the production of fertilizers is 2.72 kg CO 2 equivalent/kg for ammonium nitrate (35 % N) and 1.38 kg CO 2  equivalent/kg for urea (46.4 % N). Th erefore, an appli-cation of 157,000 tonnes of N would produce more 0.47–1.2 gigagrams 8  of CO 2  equivalent due to fertilizer production.      Agricultural Land Use  Data for the amount of land (in hectares) used in fruit production in Brazil are provided by the FAOSTAT database. If all crops are considered, fruit production in 2013 (including melon and citrus) occupied a total area of 3,211,755 hectares, making fruits the third most  extensive crop type in Brazil after oil crops and cereals/coarse grains. 9  Orange production occupies the largest area for fruit production (~700,000 in 2013), fol-lowed by cashew apples (~600,000) and bananas (~500,000) (Fig.  6.12 ).   Looking at data for the period 1961–2013, large increases in cultivated area can be seen for oranges and cashew apples, with a slight decrease for oranges after the year 2000 (Fig.  6.13 ). Th is decrease in the area harvested of oranges must have been due to a decline in world demand for orange juice and a consequent loss of market share in the juice market (Neves  2010 ). Th is author identifi ed the three main reasons for the fall in demand for orange juice as: (1) growth in consumption in emerging countries, where consumers buy cheaper drinks such as soft drinks and nectars, 7   http://knoema.com/IFAFUBC2013/fertilizer-use-by-crop-2013 8   (100 %*157,000 tonnes/35 %)*2.72. 9   Coarse grains generally refer to cereal grains other than wheat and rice—in the OECD countries, those used primarily for animal feed or brewing ( source :  https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=369 ). 164 D.M.S.

Pesticide Application  According to FAOSTAT, pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, fun-gicides, and others (such as growth regulators).

Although pesticides are applied in smaller amounts than fertilizers and soil correctors, their degree of environ-mental  persistence is much higher (Aktar et al.  2009 ). Th ere are several impacts of pesticide application in crop production and these are catego-rized and described in Table  6.3 .   According to Rigotto et al. ( 2014 ), the Brazilian pesticide market increased by 190 %, more than the double of world pesticide market, which increased by 95 % between 1992 and 2012. Brazil has overtaken    Table 6.3    Harmful effects of pesticides in the environment    Impact  Explanation  Environmental impact  Pesticides contaminate the soil, water, turf, and other vegetation. In addition to killing insects or weeds, pesticides can be toxic to other animals such as birds and fi sh, benefi cial insects (e.g. bees), and non-target plants.  Surface water contamination  Pesticides can reach surface water through runoff after application to plants and soil.  Groundwater contamination  Once groundwater is polluted with toxic chemicals, it may take many years for the contamination to dissipate or be cleaned up.  Soil contamination  Pesticides and the products of their breakdown are retained by soils to different degrees depending on the properties of the soil and the pesticide. The most important variables in soil are soil type, organic matter content, CEC (cation exchange capacity), and pH.  Effect on soil fertility  Heavy treatment of soil with pesticides can cause the decline of benefi cial soil microorganisms. Plants depend on a variety of soil microorganisms for transforming atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates; herbicides can disrupt this process.  Contamination of air, soil, and non-target vegetation  Pesticide sprays can directly reach non-target vegetation, or can run off or volatilize from the treated area to contaminate air, soil, and non-target plants. In addition to killing non-target plants outright, pesticide exposure can cause sub-lethal effects on plants.  Non-target organisms  Pesticides can harm benefi cial soil microorganisms and insects, non-target plants, fi sh, birds, and other wildlife. Herbicides, for example, are toxic to fi sh and can have devastating effects on aquatic plants. On land, herbicides are toxic to several insects, including bees, which are crucial for agricultural pollination.    Source : Aktar et al. ( 2009 )  166 D.M.S.

Data published by the ANVISA website, 10  shows that 80 % of the pesticides used in Brazil are applied in the production of soya, corn, cotton, and sugar cane. Th e remaining pesticides are applied in the production of other crops, including vegetables and fruits, especially strawberries, papaya, fi gs, grapes, pear, peaches, and melon. A cancer report released by INCA (Cancer National Institute José Alencar Gomes da Silva) reveals that in 2009, Brazil was the major consumer of pes-ticides, with an average consumption of 5.2 kg of pesticide per capita (INCA  2015 ). FAOSTAT data show the use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides/bactericides in Brazil between 1999 and 2013 (Fig.  6.14 ). It is notable that the use of herbicides increased dramatically over the period 1999–2013, surpassing the use of insecticides and of fungicides and bactericides.   Figure  6.15  shows the average use of pesticides in permanent crops on arable land using FAOSTAT data. Th e graph demonstrates that in 1991, there were around 0.4 thousand tonnes of active ingredient (the key component of pesticides) per 1000 hectares of cropland, while this 10   http://portal.anvisa.gov.br/wps/portal/anvisa/home 050100150200250300Thousand tonnes of acƟve ingredientInsecƟcidesHerbicidesFungicides & Bactericides  Fig. 6.14    Use of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides/bactericides in Brazil between 1999 and 2013 ( Source : FAOSTAT)        6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 167had tripled to around 1.2 thousand tonnes per 1000 hectares by 2002. Th e Brazilian Association for Fertilizer Dissemination (ANDA) website 11  reports an application of 10.5 litres of pesticide per hectare in 2002 and 12.0 litres in 2011.   According to Coltro et al. ( 2009 ), the current technology available for orange growing in tropical regions is intensive in its use of pesticides to control pests and diseases. Th ere are at least four main diseases respon-sible for increasing average tree mortality from 4.5 % to 7.3 %. Th ese diseases and their consequences are presented in Table  6.4 . According to Neves ( 2010 ), this has made oranges the second most intensive crop in terms of pesticides use. In 2003, outbreaks of greening and citrus varie-gated chlorosis (CVC) alone increased the use of insecticides by about 600 % (Neves  2010 ).   Coltro et al. ( 2009 ) found that for every 1000 tonnes of oranges pro-duced, about 2.75 kg of pesticides are applied. Using this value, pesticide use during the period 1991–2013 can be plotted. Th e graph in Fig.  6.16  shows that the total amount of pesticides applied in Brazilian orange pro-duction in 2013 was around 50,000 kilograms. It also shows a decrease in 2001 with a constant use (in thousand kg) until 2013, this coinciding with a decrease in the area harvested for oranges in 2001.11   http://www.anda.org.br/index.php?mpg=01.01.00andver=ing 00.20.40.60.811.219911992199319941995199619971998199920002001Tonnes per 1000 ha   Fig. 6.15    Pesticides used in permanent crops on arable land in Brazil between 1991 and 2001 ( Source : FAOSTAT)        168 D.M.S.

Parfi tt et al. ( 2010 ) found that losses are much higher for perishable foods across both industrialized and developing economies. As fresh fruits are perishable, an increase in production is likely to have an impact in food waste produced. FAOSTAT records the amount of each commodity lost through wastage during the year at all stages between production and household consumption, that is, storage and transportation. Quantities lost during the transformation of primary commodities into processed products are taken into account in the assess-ment of respective extraction and conversion rates. FAOSTAT excludes losses occurring before and during harvest and waste from both edible and inedible parts of the commodity occurring in the household. Waste is often estimated as a fi xed percentage of availability, the latter being defi ned as production plus imports plus stock withdrawals. Data from FAOSTAT show that in 2013, in Brazil, 10 % of orange production was wasted, as well as 15 % of banana production. According to FAOSTAT, losses tend to be more severe in countries where agricultural products reach consumers in urban areas after passing through several marketing stages. In fact, one of the major causes of food waste in some developing countries is the lack of adequate marketing systems and organization.  Overall, this section described the impact the production of fruits has on diff erent components of the natural environment. Table  6.5  summarizes the main fi ndings regarding the impacts of fruit produc-tion on the environment for the period 1961–2013 using data pro-vided by FAOSTAT and incorporated in several of the previous fi gures. Environmental impacts over the last few decades were used to estimate potential future problems.       Discussion  Th e international trade in fruits has grown rapidly since the mid-1980s. Th e potential for fruit production in Brazil is considerable and fruit pro-duction increased dramatically between 1961 and 2013. Since fresh fruits have a high-income elasticity, the growth of purchasing power among 170 D.M.S.

However, this increase might be smaller than expected if the percentage of household food budgets allocated to fruits and vegetables in Brazil is the same as assumed globally (4–16 % according to Ruel et al.  2004 ). Faveret Filho et al. ( n.d .) showed that the d omestic market is the main destination for the fruits produced in Brazil. Th e increase in the commercialization of fruits has brought several advan-tages to the Brazilian economy, such as employment and income, with positive socio-economic consequences (Faveret Filho et al.  n.d. ). But there are also examples of negative socio-economic eff ects such as the exclusion of small-scale producers from orange production (Bellingieri et al.  2012 ) and increased dependency on external inputs, which are less accessible to small producers, specifi cally those with precarious land ownership. Small-scale farmers have traditionally played a major role in the production of fresh fruits and vegetables, but their role in producing goods for export may be limited as they need assistance in adapting to policies, institutions, and infrastructure to take advantage of this increasing trend.  Th is chapter has specifi cally focused on the impacts of fruit produc-tion on the environment as a basis for further discussion on how these impacts can aff ect livelihoods. Th e framework chosen to begin the analysis is that already used by Gill et al. ( 2015 ). Th is is an earth system frame-work based on planetary boundaries (Rockström et al.  2009 ), which are human-determined values of the control variable set as a ‘safe’ distance from a dangerous level or from its global threshold. Beyond these bound-aries, the hypothesis is that development will no longer be sustainable. Th e planetary boundaries approach focuses on the biophysical processes of the earth system that determine the self-regulating capacity of the planet. From the nine boundaries proposed by Rockström et al. ( 2009 ), this chap-ter focused only on the infl uence of fruit production on climate change, P and N cycles, freshwater use, and changes in land use. It is considered that these infl uences are aggravated by food waste and energy consumption, so attention was drawn to these processes. Th e infl uence of fruit production in the remaining earth systems (ocean acidifi cation, stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, rate of biodiversity loss, chemical pollution) was not analysed in this chapter. Th e thresholds for Brazil were not analysed either, but the available literature allows for some informed 172 D.M.S. Felicianocommentary. Further analysis would be essential in order to assess the sus-tainability of fruit production in Brazil and to identify more sustainable practices, if required. Some governments, for example, the UK govern-ment, have been encouraging the food and drink industry to use resources more sustainably (DEFRA  2015 ). Th is chapter aimed also to arrive at an understanding of some of the trade- off s between fruit production and environmental services in Brazil. In a context of increasing competition for resources in the water, energy, and food sectors, it is important to understand the existing synergies and trade-off s, as these are key to the well-being and economic development of nations. Assessments related to the environmental impacts of an expansion in fruit production in Brazil have already been undertaken by several authors (e.g. Coltro et al.  2009 —orange; Basset-Mens et al.  2014 —mango).  Th ere is no baseline to compare these values with, or threshold to determine whether fruit production in Brazil is unsustainable, but data presented in Table  6.5  show that fruit production has been putting pres-sure on water resources through increased freshwater use, freshwater eutrophication, use of pesticides, and waste production. Fruit produc-tion is also contributing to pressure on land use and likely to aggravate the problem of GHG emissions.  In particular, incremental production of fruits with a high water foot-print (e.g. apples, grapes) will contribute to increasing the pressure on water resources. Brazil’s potential increased participation in the interna-tional fruit market will contribute to the problem of large exports of virtual water. Virtual water is defi ned as the total volume of water needed to produce and process a commodity or service. Th e external water foot-print is the total amount of virtual water used in other countries which is imported when goods produced in those countries are imported. To the UK alone, Brazil exports 4441 million m 3  of water embedded in products such as beef, soybeans, coff ee, poultry, livestock, maize, rapeseed, wheat, pigs, milk, and sunfl ower oil. Because Brazil is the world’s lead supplier of concentrated orange juice, the country’s fruit sector is also an important exporter of virtual water. An increase in the consumption of exotic fruits such as mangoes and guavas in Europe and the USA also exacerbates the problem of virtual water as these fruits have a large water footprint (see Table  6.2 ), compared with other exotic fruits such as pineapple and 6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 173papaya. Tucci ( 2009 ) believes that water, embedded in food production, will become an important commodity in the world market. Th is will mean that some countries will export water, while other countries will import water. Under climate change, or changes in the demand from other water uses, water can become a scarce good, so a mechanism of exclusion for embedded water might be implemented (e.g. price) with consequences to food prices.  In the case of fruits, water footprint is, in general, much lower than those of other products exported by Brazil, such as beef (15,400 litres of water per kilogram produced) or coff ee (18,900 litres of water per kilogram produced) (see Mekonnen and Hoekstra  2011 ). However, it is important to take into account the impact of food production on water in order to engage decision-makers in developing and implementing plausible actions that will result in positive long-term outcomes both on the environment and on the economic sustainability of the Brazilian fruit sector.  Th e development of fruit production in Brazil has taken place with the help of irrigation, which is highly dependent on groundwater abstraction and rainfall. In Brazil, groundwater abstraction is not monitored or licensed and is exposed to unsustainable management, with withdrawals exceeding the rate of recharge. According to de Souza ( 2015 ), every ten years, the depth of artesian wells, which is a main source of water for agricultural production in some regions, increase by 50 metres. On the other hand, rainfall shortages, like the one that occurred in the São Paulo region in 2014–2015, are likely to threaten crop productivity in the future, especially for crops dependent on irrigation such as fruits and vegetables. Th erefore, increased production of fruits that require large amounts of water to grow might not be sustainable in a scenario of increasing droughts. Some stud-ies already show a gradual increase in the average temperatures, reduced rainfall in the northern region of São Paulo, and long periods of drought (Neves  2010 ; De Souza  2015 ). To maintain production levels, water may be transported from places where it is available, putting pressure on water resources in other Brazilian catchments or regions and increasing GHG emissions associated with pumping and transportation.  Fortunately, there are some practices which can reduce the water used in agricultural production, for example, implementing more water-effi  cient systems. Th ese measures should take into consideration not only water 174 D.M.S. Felicianoconservation benefi ts and implementation costs but also other factors such as energy dependency and GHG emissions. According to Maraseni et al. ( 2014 ), analysis of the trade-off s between water effi  ciency and energy use in irrigated agriculture is critical to ensure that the economic effi  ciency of agricultural production is maintained; these authors stress that both mitigation and adaptation aspects must be evaluated. A large proportion of the water demand could also potentially be met by chang-ing consumer behaviour and reducing food waste. Increases in produc-tion will certainly be important to the Brazilian economy in the future, but the growth will be constrained by the fi nite resources provided by the earth’s land, oceans, and atmosphere (Godfray et al.  2010 ). According to FAOSTAT, about a third of all food produced is lost or wasted. Th e increasing distances between the points of production and consumption contribute to increasing food waste along the supply chain, especially in the case of highly perishable products such as fruits. Th erefore, with the potential increase in Brazil’s participation in the international fruit trade, an increase in waste is anticipated. Th ere are signifi cant potential savings to be made in terms of water, energy, money, and reduced GHG emissions from cutting food waste with reasonable investment and eff ort. Regarding the use of pesticides, this could also potentially be reduced, as Faveret Filho et al. (n.d) report an excessive amount of pesticide use in Brazilian agriculture, including fruit production. Th e overuse of chemical pesticides in developing countries has resulted in a series of codes in some countries to promote ethical production systems. However, the associ-ated compliance costs of these regulatory steps may impact negatively on small-scale farmers, who have limited access to information about the codes and standards required (Ouma and Whitfi eld  2012 ).  Dietary changes also could have an indirect impact on Brazilian water systems since the volume of freshwater that is used to produce food varies according to the food types produced (Hoekstra and Hung  2002 ). However, this would depend on whether the change is related to imported food or domestically grown food.  Changes in the types of fruits produced could also have a signifi cant impact on GHG emissions (Smith et al.  2013 ) since there are fruits with higher carbon footprint than others. Governments have the potential to incentivize the production of fruits that require fewer inputs to reduce 6 Impacts of Fruit Production in Brazil 175the impact on water and land resources and reduce GHG emissions through the rewarding of farmers for the provision of ecosystem services and health benefi ts. Native tropical fruit species may be more environ-mentally friendly and often have great potential as sources of dietary  vitamins, minerals, and energy.      Conclusion  Th is analysis using mainly data published by FAOSTAT found that fruit production in Brazil has a major impact on the environment, especially on water resources. Th e framework used was an initial step in identifying ways to make the fruit production sector in Brazil more sustainable. It was not possible to determine whether this impact is beyond the tipping point or threshold as defi ned in the planetary boundaries framework for Brazil. Having said that, this analysis was the fi rst step in raising questions and suggesting directions for future research, for example, what are the risks for fruit production due to climate change, how can agro- ecology techniques contribute to the resilience of the crops, and what are the ecosystem services associated to diff erent fruit production systems. Fruits and vegetables have received insuffi  cient research and development atten-tion from the international community, but the high demand and high value of the products should trigger increased investment in this sector. In Brazil, the excessive use of pesticides and the high water footprint of some fruits are certainly the major environmental impacts to tackle fi rst.

Th ese processes have a particu-larly great impact on the primary sectors of the economy, contributing to what is called the commoditization of agriculture, and in this respect, Brazil stands as a unique example. Big  corporations aim to achieve the highest pos-sible productivity in order to maximize profi ts. To this end, water, one of the most basic resources in agricultural production, is exploited to the extreme. An example of this is the use of deepwater aquifers as a major source of         R.   de   Toledo Peres      ((cid:13)) •    J.  G.   de   Souza      State University of São Paulo (UNESP) ,   Rio Claro ,  Brazil    water for irrigation. Th ese sources of water, which should be prioritized as strategic reserves, have often shown signs of depletion and scarcity in various key intensive farming areas of Brazil. Th e dynamics of water exploitation in such cases is what links the two processes examined in this text. First, the authors examine the eff ective use of resources in irrigated production from free or confi ned aquifers. Second, the study examines production standards arising from the concept of virtual water export and the use of green, blue, and grey water types. Demand for all these types of water is established in production processes, but there is also an eff ective extraction of the physical water reserves for incorporation into agricultural products, which we call consumptive use, and, consequently, for the material export of water. Th ese two processes—namely consumptive and non-consumptive uses of water—play an important role in the hydrological cycle and need to be refl ected in a new water balance model.      Setting the Scene  In the last two decades, Brazil has been setting records for production and export of grains, soybean in particular. Meanwhile, products derived from sugar cane, fruits, and other agricultural activities have also become very important both nationally and in foreign markets. For many, these developments are a positive sign for the economy and an indication that economic growth has resumed after the turbulence of the 1980s and early 1990s. A surplus in the trade balance and an increase in the national mini-mum wage are two positive eff ects observed during this period, which seem to confi rm the “evolution” of Brazilian agriculture. Th e country is increasingly specializing in the production of primary goods, such as the commodities mentioned above, while the formation of competitive regions shows the dynamic expansion of agriculture (Frederico  2012 ). However, there are also production costs and negative externalities that are not always incorporated or analysed in relation to the supposedly posi-tive outcomes of contemporary agriculture in the country. One of these externalities is the increased use of water, an issue which is not unrelated to the recent crisis in Brazil’s urban water supply, as in the case of São Paulo.  Before anything else, it is essential to revisit our conceptualization and interpretation of the basic properties of water. According to Latour ( 1994 182 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souza[1991] ), water constitutes a hybrid: when analysing issues around water, it is necessary to consider the inseparability of nature and society, that is, take into account natural and environmental aspects, whether physi-cal, chemical, or biological, as well as human and social aspects, whether economic, technological, or political. In this sense, water is a complete hybrid according to Latour’s theory of hybrids, and all these aspects must be considered if an appropriate understanding of water management problems is to be reached (Swyngedouw  2004 ; Ioris  2013 ).  Water has important physical features, such as temperature, trans-parency, and physical state (solid—ice or snow, liquid, or gas—water vapour and air humidity). Its chemical characteristics include its composi-tion (H 2 O) and the presence or absence of contaminants (heavy metals, nitrates, etc.). Also important are the biological characteristics of water, because in addition to being fundamental to life on Earth, water is part of the composition of every living being and every source of food (Berg et al.  2014 ). When it comes to human aspects, water is signifi cant in every sphere of human interaction, whether social, economic, political, cultural, or environmental (Silva et al.  2012 ). More recently, water has started to become the subject of geopolitical confl icts in countries where its scarcity is already at a more advanced stage and there is limited willingness to resolve disputes through negotiation and compromise (Souza  2015 ).  Based on the above, the text is organized as follows. Th e fi rst part deals with concepts related to water, whether natural, economic, or social. Th en, we present the concept of virtual water (Hoekstra and Hung  2002 ), to be able, later, to bring forth the idea of physical water we are proposing. Th is latter one took us to the measurements of exported volumes of physical water from Brazil, linked, at last, to the water balance considerations.      Water Resources, or Simply Water?  As a central element 1  on Earth, occupying almost three quarters of the planet’s surface, water is an object of analysis in various sciences. To physicists, it is a liquid at room temperature, colourless (slightly bluish), odourless, and tasteless (when pure), which, under “normal  pressure” 1   Note that for chemistry, water cannot be called an  element , because it is a compound. 7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 183(1 atm), solidifi es at 0 °C and evaporates at 100 °C. To chemists, it is a compound formed from two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom with the chemical formula H 2 O, and is known as the “universal solvent” as it has the physicochemical property of dissolving many other chemicals. In the biological sciences, water is important because our bod-ies (and those of other living beings) are mainly composed of water, and “dehydration” is a condition that can lead to death (Berg et al.  2014 ). Th e importance of water is even more comprehensive when it comes to the applied sciences, most of all in hydrology (etymologically “water study”), considered by Chow ( 1959 ) as a science that analyses the water in all its chemical, physical, and biological forms, as well as the interface of those diff erent forms with human life.  Meanwhile, the social sciences deal with understanding various diff er-ent representations and symbolisms related to the concept and the experi-ence of water use. Roberto Malvezzi, a former national coordinator of the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT— Comissão Pastoral da Terra ), argues that we are facing a new paradigm in approaching an issue that demands a conceptual revision: it is necessary to make a distinction between water resources and water:  Water is in nature and this is prior to all forms of life. But it is also a fun-damental part of life, making up 70% of the human body, for example. So we have to include in the debate on water an ethical principle, which rec-ognizes its natural and biological value, its social value—a population without water can have no peace—cultural and religious. So do not just think of its multiple uses for power generation, irrigation, navigation. We have to speak in multiple values as well. (Carta Maior  2005 )  For instance, Swyngedouw ( 2004 ) uses the example of water to demon-strate the process of “Competitive Construction of Spatial Scales”, in the cases of Ecuador (the city of Guayaquil) and Spain (in its modernization process), and considers water resources as “starting points for reconstruc-tion and theorizing of the political-ecological scale process”. For him, water pervades all realities, spaces, and imaginable scales in the world. It is biological, physical, chemical, social, economic, and political at the same time. By his turn, Ioris ( 2013 : 3) highlights the theoretical and  academic building of a true “geography of water”:184 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souza  Th e geography of water is based on the recognition that there is a perma-nent and dialectical interaction between human activity and the environ-ment. Water is essential in countless natural processes and at the same time is an integral part of social relationships. You cannot separate the movement of water from human interference, nor ignore the hydrological conditions of communities and civilizations. Th erefore, there is an interdependent rela-tionship between society and water resources, creating a cycle that, rather than being purely hydrological, is fundamentally hydrosocial.  But in legal terms, the concept of “water resources” may have a miss-ing signifi cance of social, regional, or natural specifi cities. According to Pereira Jr. ( 2004 : 3):  Th e renewable portion of the Earth’s fresh water is about 40,000 km 3  per year, corresponding to the diff erence between atmospheric precipitations and water evaporation on the surface of the continents. Not all of this vol-ume, however, can be harnessed by man. Nearly two-thirds returns quickly to waterways and oceans, after heavy rains. Th e rest is absorbed by the ground, permeating its surface layers to be stored in underground aquifers, which, in turn, will be the main sources of hydration for the waterways during droughts. Th e relatively stable portion of the water supply is there-fore just under 14,000 km 3  per year. Th is portion of fresh water available to mankind in the current technological stage and at suitable costs with its various uses is what is called the water resource.  Importantly, this concept is legally accepted and has therefore served as a normative basis for Brazil’s entire system of social organization and envi-ronmental regulation (Pereira  2004 ). Th e last author points out, among other characteristics of water resources use in Brazil, the poor distribution of stocks, showing that despite being the country with the largest “endog-enous” water production, it ranks only 23rd in the world in terms of per capita availability. Th is misallocation is even more evident when analysed regionally. Th e North and Centre-west Regions have 2–11 times as much water available compared with the national average, while the Northeast and Southeast Regions have only about 10 % of the total.  We can infer, then, that water is much more than a resource. Th e word “resource” has connotations of merchandize and consumer goods, and treats water as an object of economic value, which some scholars 7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 185have proposed. Th e great social risk inherent in this approach is the pric-ing and commoditization of water. Water would become, according to this model, a commodity available only to those who can pay, changing its status from a human right to a tradable commodity (a perspective favoured by certain large corporations, which defend privatization and aim to limit access to water):  In the opinion of Peter Brabeck, president of Nestlé, water should be treated like any other food and have a market value established by the law of supply and demand. (Portal Metrópole  2015 )  Th is market model that large corporations seek to establish is a con-crete expression of the idea that water is not only a necessity for human consumption, but can also be understood as a resource for productive input and basis for capital accumulation. However, such attitude can be a source of confl ict between states, societies, and corporations. In Brazil, the dominance of such ideas in the logic of production (Souza  2014 ) links the commodifi cation of water directly to the issue of land grabbing, that is, water problems are also an element of agrarian disputes; accord-ing to the CPT, confl icts over water in the country increased by 26 % in 2014 compared with the previous year, with 127 confl icts aff ecting around 42,800 people (CPT  2014 ). Th e water thus proves far beyond a “water” resource because it is, above all, a natural and social good, and therefore a human right. It would be incorrect to characterize the water only as an economic resource, and analyses in this regard are being made, such as the concept of “virtual water”, as discussed below.      Questioning Virtual Water  In 2002, Hoekstra proposed the concept of a “water footprint”, an allu-sion to what was already known as an ecological footprint, only in this case referring to the volume of water used in the entire production chain for any given agricultural or industrial product. (Also refer to Chap.   6     for more details on water footprint). Th is water can be said to be “virtually” exported or imported by a country. According to Hoekstra and Hung 186 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souza( 2002 ), the water involved in the production of a kilogram of beef, for example, is about 15,000 litres, which includes consumption during all stages of the production process, from raw materials to intermediate and fi nal products.  To describe the composition of “virtual” water, water is classifi ed into three diff erent types: blue (superfi cial or underground water, that is, rivers, lakes, or aquifers), green (soil moisture), and grey (pure water required to “decontaminate” or dilute the contamination of natural water reserves that may occur during the production process) (Hoekstra  2011 ). Th is classifi cation forms the basis of the calculation of water used in the international trade of agricultural products, showing that agro-export countries like Brazil have a vocation for virtual water export due to the country’s self-suffi  ciency in terms of water resources. Along the same lines, Hoekstra and Hung ( 2002 ) suggest that countries with a water defi cit do not normally produce goods that require large amounts of vir-tual water, and are more likely to import this type of product.  However, we favour a rather more critical approach to this concept, which includes the following:    1.    Questioning the general view that declaring a country to be “water scarce” or “water self-suffi  cient” should involve regional analysis of water resources, and consideration of the diff erent existing  morphoclimatic fi elds in the country and the diff erent ways water is used (Souza  2015 );      2.    Quantifying the volume of water “physically” incorporated into the agricultural products exported by our country (Souza et al.  2010 );      3.    Re-evaluating the analysis of how much water is required to produce various agricultural products, through water balance considerations.    At the next three subsections, we are going to clarify these three critics above.    1.     Diﬀ erences Between Brazilian Morphoclimatic Fields       Th e fi rst critique of Hoekstra’s proposition is certainly very acute. Known for its continental dimensions, Brazil has more than one 7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 187 morphoclimatic domain, with certain water systems and soil conditions that mean it cannot be declared a country where water is “plentiful” throughout (Ab’Saber  1977 ). Th is fact alone would be enough to chal-lenge Hoekstra’s suggestion that the country has a productive vocation. However, the availability of groundwater resources must also be evalu-ated since aquifers have a clearance rate which can vary from short term (less than a year) to long term, or even geological timescales in the case of deeper aquifers, which may require thousands of years for replenish-ment (Gastmans et al.  2013 ). Brazilian agricultural production in some regions, such as those that are semi-arid, depends largely on irrigation. So, in addition to climatic diff erences, hydrogeological diff erences are important variables.    2.     Volume of Physical Water       “Physical” water in an agricultural product may refer to one of three types of water: “ humidity or moisture ”, “ from photosynthesis ”, and “ from fermentation ”. First, the actual water present in an agricultural product in its known form is H 2 O itself (humidity). In some products, such as orange juice, which is a major export product for Brazil, the proportion of moisture may reach 95 % (NEPA  2011 ); that is, almost the entire exported product is water. In other products, such as soybeans, water content is lower, reaching only 14 % (Souza et al.  2010 ).  In the latter case, the second concept of physical water becomes more important. Th is is water  from photosynthesis , which is the water incorpo-rated into the product during the genesis of the plant, whereby nature transforms the water absorbed from the soil by the plant’s roots into organic matter present in the plant, whether mono-, di-, or polysaccha-rides, or vegetable protein. We estimate that almost 60 % of the material in dry (dehydrated) plant material also comes from water, not only in known liquid form (H 2 O), but also in the form of atoms that come from broken-down water molecules in, for example, glucose, and are then incorporated into other molecules, as exemplifi ed by the chemical equa-tion of photosynthesis:  6H 2 O + 6CO 2  → C 6 H 12 O 6  + 6O 2  (in the presence of light and chlorophyll) 188 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souza Taking this into account, the moisture content of soybeans would increase from a maximum of 14 % to about 65 % of incorporated water, depending on the type of bean. In some specifi c cases, such as sugar cane and its derivatives (e.g. refi ned sugar and ethanol), a third concept of physical water appears. During the production of ethanol, sucrose becomes ethyl alcohol via the process of  fermentation . During this pro-cess, the glucose molecule is broken down, producing ethanol and car-bon dioxide: C 6 H 12 O 6  → 2C 2 H 6 O + 2CO 2  (Berg et al.  2014 ). As water molecules were required to obtain glucose, in the process of photosyn-thesis, and as there is a loss of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, ethanol production requires about 117 grams of water to obtain 100 grams of ethanol. It means that the volume of water used in ethanol production is higher than the volume of ethanol itself, which means that the volume of water in ethanol exceeds the actual volume of ethanol.  Peres ( 2012 ) estimated the incorporated volumes of physical water in the orange juice, sugar, and alcohol exported by Brazil in 2008 and 2011. Th e study relied on data from the Unicamp Table of Food Composition, or TACO for short (NEPA  2011 ), sugar and ethanol export data from the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association (UNICA), and orange juice export data from the National Association of Citrus Exporters (CitrusBR). In addition, according to the Nucleus of Studies and Researches of Food (NEPA) data ( 2011 ), confi rmed in laboratory tests, Peres ( 2012 ) con-cluded that an orange (varying depending on type) is made up of about 90 % humidity and about 10 % carbohydrates and fi bre. Of these, about 60 % may be considered water, originating from photosynthesis.  However, according to CitrusBR, it is not the fruit  in natura  that is exported. According to NEPA data ( 2011 ), the chemical composition of the juice is very similar to that of the fruit: approximately 91 % moisture and about 9 % carbohydrates (also varying according to the type of orange), or 96.4 % incorporated water. According to CitrusBR ( 2015 ), whose fi gures are established for frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ), this type of juice is concentrated on average 5.5 times for export. So, this type of juice has 5.5 times more carbohydrates in place of moisture, meaning that the proportion in this variant is 50.5 % moisture and 49.5 % carbohydrates. As 60 % of carbohydrates are considered to be water altered by photosynthesis, the fi nal incorporated water content of FCOJ is approximately 80 %. 7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 189 Based on these data, it was concluded that over four years (2008–2011), Brazil physically exported 1,809,044 m 3  of water, that is, 1.8 billion litres, only in FCOJ (including the moisture content of the product itself and water incorporated from photosynthesis). Over the same period, Brazil’s exports of NFC (not from concentrate) orange juice comprised a volume of 3,669,943 m 3  of incorporated water, or roughly 3.7 billion litres. It is important to consider that sales of this form of orange juice are growing.  As regards the export of physical water incorporated into the sub- products of sugar cane, it appears that for sugar, which has about 60 % water absorbed by photosynthesis, a volume of 58,274,005 m 3 , or almost 58.3 billion litres, of water was exported over the same period (2008–2011). In the case of ethanol, which is considered to contain approxi-mately 117 % incorporated water, a volume of 14,391,066 m 3  of water, or almost 14.4 billion litres, was exported over the same period. So, just from these four products, 78,144,048 m 3  of physically incorporated water was exported over four years, an annual average of 19.5 billion litres.    3.     Considerations for Water Balance       Water vulnerability, observed in several regions of Brazil and the world, is measured in terms of water balance. Initially proposed by Th ornthwaite and Mather ( 1955 ), this tool is still widely used. Assessment is based on fi gures for soil moisture variation, taking into account rainfall measure-ments, evapotranspiration, and run-off , all of which cause increases or decreases in moisture in the soil being studied. However, with advances in well drilling technologies, water withdrawal from aquifers has become common practice in agribusiness and other production activities. For this reason, it is now necessary to consider new water entering the system (such as a watershed) as a variable.  Th e traditional water balance formula is as follows (Th ornthwaite and Mather  1955 ):  ΔS = P – ETR – R – I  where:  ΔS = soil moisture variation  P = precipitation  ETR = evapotranspiration (actual) 190 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souza R = run-off   I = infi ltration  It is noteworthy that this balance model (traditional) does not con-sider aquifer water withdrawal as an input source in the system, nor does it consider the “virtual” or physical water that would be “exported” (system output). For this reason, it is proposed that these two variables should be included in the model in order to provide a more complete analysis of water availability and vulnerability, as follows: one variable to address the lack of information with regard to the exploitation of water from aquifers, which we will call irrigated water (iW); and the other to consider the volume of water that eff ectively leaves the basin in question in the form of physical water (phW). Th e latter is also referred to as consumptive use. It is important to note that, at the moment, we do not have a way to measure virtual water as it does not represent a consistent volume within the water balance equation. It is, however, important in other studies in which the determination of “grey” water is of utmost relevance due to the problems observed today with groundwater con-tamination from pesticides, industrial waste, and other contaminants such as the “vinasse” or “slop” from the “fertirrigation” of sugar cane (Souza and Peres  2012 ).  Th is gives us a new water balance formula, with the two new proposed variables added to the model:  ΔS = P + iW − ETR − R − I − phW  where:  iW = ground water from irrigation  phW = physical water consumption incorporated into the product      Beyond Those Shortcomings  Th e importance of knowing the actual volume of irrigated water and con-sumptive use (physical water) is to determine with a reasonable degree of accuracy the volume of physical water incorporation in agricultural production compared with the volume of groundwater withdrawal. Th is information will allow us to determine which of two possible causes is responsible for the depletion of aquifers. Th e fi rst, more optimistic, 7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 191 scenario would be that the proportion of consumptive use is low com-pared with the consumption of irrigated water. In this case, the deple-tion of aquifers could be explained by evapotranspiration and losses and/or waste during the production process. High evapotranspiration is not problematic since this water returns to nature through the natural hydrological cycle and will eventually contribute to refi lling the aquifers (although sometimes very slowly). In addition, this evapotranspiration is a normal feature of the regional climate. In the case of loss or waste of water during production processes, a proposed analysis would use applied technology to accurately compare producers’ water use and determine which irrigation methods use water most effi  ciently, as exemplifi ed in the study of spray irrigation versus drip irrigation. As a result, improvements could be achieved with some investment.  Th e second, more pessimistic, scenario would involve a high propor-tion of consumptive water use from aquifers, meaning that agricultural production relies directly on water from groundwater sources. Th is would reveal that current methods of agricultural production exploit all available sources of water indiscriminately, using non-renewable assets for the purposes of profi t-making. Eventually, the likely results of this scenario would be a trail of destruction in the natural environment, ultimately leaving families without water and food, undermining the economy, and even causing political confl ict, as noted at the beginning of this chapter.  It is too early to talk about exact percentage values that would deter-mine a “high” or “low” proportion, but comparative studies can be made between products that deplete aquifers and those that preserve them, giv-ing a real sense of a limit to how much agricultural productivity can be increased, which is vital in the case of a country where agriculture is fundamental to the economy.  One proposal to ease this  hydrosocial  impasse regarding restrictive or conservative measures would be to impose restrictive measures that would eff ectively prohibit the use of certain aquifers in regions of the country where percentages of irrigated water incorporation are high. In areas where the situation is less critical, measures such as taxation and environmental services could help to reduce production losses, 192 R. de Toledo Peres and J.G. de Souzaalways bearing in mind the risk of pricing and commoditization of water as a natural resource.      Final Considerations  As seen above, volumes of physical water incorporation are high in some of the major Brazilian export products, which are fundamental to the country’s economy. Where high-humidity products such as orange juice can contain up to 95 % water, and even low-humidity plant-based prod-ucts such as refi ned sugar can contain over 60 % water, questions about the physical and virtual export of water and its eff ects on water balance are of vital national importance.  Some studies that are taking place in the state of São Paulo (Brazil) suggest that the use of water and methods of land use in monoculture production of, for example, sugar cane, orange, soybeans, and other agri-cultural commodities can produce long-term average moisture reduction processes in soil and lead to desertifi cation or  sandiﬁ cation . Th is phe-nomenon occurs when soil moisture shows a trend towards reduction as a result of agricultural production without proper conservation man-agement. Factors that cause desertifi cation include: the removal of natu-ral vegetation (woods and forests), particularly in groundwater recharge areas; a “splash” eff ect leading to soil sealing (where rainwater generates soil compaction); erosion from rainfall with increased run-off , especially under extreme weather conditions; and pesticide use, leading to the elim-ination of micro-organisms and ants, which are essential for aeration and soil nutrition.  Th ese factors have been identifi ed as the main causes of desertifi cation in regions which are not prone to desertifi cation under normal climatic conditions but where agricultural monocultures can trigger this phe-nomenon. In addition, there is concern for the output of families who traditionally used the land in these areas for polycultural farming, often subsistence, with demand for physical and virtual water compatible with minimal environmental impacts, as the advance of agribusiness has led companies to invest in these productive lands.      7 Agricultural Production and Water Balance 193   References    Ab’Saber, A.N. 1977.

Its large area, widely dispersed population, and the small number of economic activities based in the region’s river basins have hampered the implementation of decentralized and partic-ipatory institutional structures as defi ned in Brazil’s Water Law 9433, approved in 1997. Th e lack of spaces for negotiation, combined with rising demand for water and energy, has led to serious confl ict, as was recently the case with the Belo Monte Dam, under construction along the lower Xingu River. Th e growing demand for water and energy has led to confl ict and distress, while state authorities and the agriculture sec-tor have focused their attention on land tenure and deforestation, leav-ing water management and access as a secondary issue. However, while         V.  L.   Empinotti      ((cid:13))   Federal University of ABC (UFABC) ,   Santo André ,  Brazil     water is not explicitly on the agenda, it is water availability that allows  intensive food production in the region to expand. So, how are formal water institutions reaching the local and municipal scale? Who are the groups involved? How are their strategies infl uencing water access and environmental conservation in the region?  Th is chapter briefl y investigates the ways in which water issues have been discussed and negotiated in the region, informed by results from an empirical study conducted in the municipality of Canarana on the Upper Xingu River Basin in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s main soybean pro-duction region. In the specifi c case of the Upper Xingu region, industrial- scale agriculture in the form of soybean and corn (maize) production has grown exponentially since 1990, which has changed farming practices, local leadership structures, and the relationships involved in land use and land allocation. Th ese are all signifi cant issues that deserve proper con-sideration (Durigan et al.  2013 ; Le Tourneau et al.  2013 ; Vanwey et al.  2013 ), and the situation exemplifi es how water security in the region is under signifi cant pressure due to these multiple uses of water, raising seri-ous questions about the mechanisms of water access in the area. Since the adoption of the 1997 Water Law, governance has become a key compo-nent of water resources management in Brazil. Participatory institutions have been created, and decision-making must now involve various sectors of society in addition to public agencies.  Th e inclusion of these new participants in decision-making has made the process more dynamic, refl ecting the various challenges and structures present at diff erent times. At the same time, water infl uences the transformation of the economic and social landscape through the complex relationships between human beings, economic practices, and cultural factors that make water resources so socially signifi cant and thus infl uence governance practices (see, among others, Swyngedouw  1997 ,  1999 ; Swyngedouw et al.  2002 ; Prudham  2003 ). Changes in water management strategies lead to the emergence of new issues that redefi ne how water and its use are understood by various social groups, and can also lead to changes in institutional arrangements and power fl ows as these respond to the dynamic appropriation and understand-ing of water (Empinotti and Jacobi  2012 ). Th erefore, it is important to understand the range and complexity of social actors and their  multiple 198 V.L. Empinottistrategies in order to propose new mechanisms for considering such dynamics. An important consequence of this consideration is that water governance processes and instruments established in law should be adjusted and re-created where necessary depending on the specifi c local and regional context.  Th e purpose of this chapter is to map and understand existing institu-tional arrangements in order to identify power structures and the main approaches of decision-makers to managing water resources in the Upper Xingu region. Th e text is organized into four sections. Th e fi rst off ers a theoretical discussion that relates water governance to the politics of scale in order to help provide an understanding of how tensions between environmental and production issues lead to new institutional arrange-ments between diff erent scales, thus redefi ning water resources issues in the region. I start by explaining how formal institutions are present at state level, describing the main players in the region and examining the politics of scale currently in place. In the following two sections, institu-tional arrangements in the region are discussed, with an analysis of how these arrangements activate diff erent scales of social action. I explore the reasons for such arrangements and examine the case study in the Upper Xingu region, detailing the region’s particularities and specifi cities. I then discuss how water management has been infl uenced indirectly by pro-grams and partnerships that have focused primarily on forestry recovery. Th e chapter concludes with an analysis of the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), farmers, and municipal agencies as major stake-holders in water governance practices and the consequences of actions whose ultimate aim is the recovery of native vegetation.      Politics of Scale and the Practices of Water Governance  Th e introduction of governance to the management of nature refl ects a new model of political practices, which emerged in a specifi c  sociopolitical context as a result of the interaction of various social actors trying to secure results beyond conventional state interventions. Centralized state control was broken up, and a new form of interorganizational  coordination was 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 199adopted that was based on self-governing networks rather than following established hierarchies or market forces (Kooiman  1993 ; Rhodes  1997 ). When applied to environmental management, the environmental gover-nance agenda creates, often controversially, conditions for the establish-ment of new institutional spaces where the public and private sectors can interact, and technicians can interact with users.  Governance , a more inclusive term than  government , refers to the socially acceptable imple-mentation of public policies which amplifi es the relationship between society, the state, markets, lawmakers, and policymakers, and deals with all the government actions associated with well-being and quality of life that ultimately lead to better environmental health.  Th is implies the establishment of a system of rules, norms, and behav-iors that refl ects the values and worldviews of those aff ected by this insti-tutional framework. Th e construction of this system is a participatory process, and, above all, one of shared learning (Empinotti and Jacobi  2012 ). At territorial level, governance is coordinated through partner-ships, coalitions, and alliances between diff erent actors in collective initia-tives, with the ultimate aim of promoting the interaction of government representatives with other social actors. Because individual actors, public or private, have neither the full knowledge nor access to all the infor-mation needed to solve complex, dynamic, and diversifi ed problems, conventional responses under the rigid intervention of the state tend to fail in situations that require them to deal with multiple interdependen-cies; this demonstrates the need for strong ties between the private sector, social organizations, and all spheres of public administration.  As a result, the challenges of environmental governance are related to this ability to bring together diff erent social actors with diff erent perspectives for meaningful negotiation, leading to strategies and solutions to complex dilemmas such as how to guarantee water security and environmental con-servation. As these are fundamentally environmental issues, the understand-ing of governance practices should not be restricted to the network of water users, but should also include large technological systems and socionatural processes aff ected by socioeconomic and political pressures (Bakker  2010 ). In the process of water governance, it is essential to recognize how the fl ows of power and water are interconnected, transforming society and the envi-ronment together. More than ever, the  transformation of cultural practices 200 V.L. Empinottiand the (socionatural) landscape is mediated by institutional arrangements, and an integrated vision of the relationships involved is more likely to pro-mote new managerial approaches that recognize the degree of complexity and the politico- ecological tensions involved.  When analyzed from the perspective of political ecology, the study of water governance recognizes that access to water is not merely a result of capital accumulation and the purchase of material goods, but rather of how people are able to increase their access through their engagement with other actors or affi  liations, or through participation in institutions, and how their relationships are governed by the logics of the state, mar-ket, and civil society (Berry  1989 ; Bebbington  1999 ; Leach and Mearns  1999 ; Ribot and Peluso  2003 ). When considering the mechanisms that control access to natural resources, and the institutions that infl uence these processes, we fi nd not only obstacles but also new possibilities for understanding how interactions between old and new players, combined with institutional practices, allow certain groups to access resources while denying these resources to others (Coles and Wallace  2005 ; Empinotti  2011 ). Access to water resources depends on institutional arrangements that ultimately refl ect the social structures present in each region and sociocultural context.  Th e study of institutional relations and their consequences also requires a refl ection on the scales at which these processes occur. With the inclusion of concepts such as decentralization and participation in water management practices infl uenced by the neoliberal management of nature (Himley  2008 ; Cohen and Davidson  2011 ), the scale of analysis has usually been the watershed or river basin. In the Brazilian context, the watershed has been identifi ed as the basic planning unit, as stipulated in the text of Law 9433. We could say that this legal provision refl ects the emergence and consolidation of the international perspective on integrated water resources management (IWRM), which has been a key component of the water resources management reform proposed by mul-tilateral agencies like the World Bank since the 1990s (Jacobi et al.  2014 ). At the same time, the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 formally established a system of decentralized state management and created new participa-tory spaces in an attempt to respond to social demands for democracy. In the context of the new constitution, and under pressure from multilateral 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 201agencies such as the World Bank, the river basin became the main plan-ning unit and a space for the exercise of participatory democracy through river basin councils and committees in Brazil (Warner  2007 ).  On the other hand, in recent years, it has been argued that the scale where water governance practices occur transcends the physical and hydrological borders of the river basins (Budds and Hinojosa  2012 ; Warner et al.  2008 ; Lebel et al.  2005 ). Despite the decentralization of decision-making to the river basin scale, laws and regulations are nor-mally defi ned in other spheres of negotiation such as the national scale; likewise, productive sectors, such as mining, tend to access water from various diff erent river basins, and effl  uents can also be discharged beyond the original watershed (Budds and Hinojosa  2012 ; Warner et al.  2008 ). In addition, the recognition of virtual water fl ows that occur via the export and import of consumer goods has contributed to the realization that water resources issues have global relevance (Allan  1998 ; Sojamo et al.  2012 ). Th e analysis of the role of private actors, such as agribusiness companies, along with international NGOs and development agencies, has revealed the infl uence of these actors in the space of global water governance as they attempt to defi ne practices and set up new moni-toring thresholds, which are required to improve water use effi  ciency in various production processes and to better determine which water users are responsible for water shortages (Sojamo and Larson  2012 ; Daniel and Sojamo  2012 ; Empinotti and Jacobi  2013 ). It is possible to identify new networks and actors who, through their production and consump-tion practices, have expanded access and allocation strategies and tried to improve water management in and beyond the basin scale.  Th e relationships between diff erent geographical scales change over time as power dynamics alter, and water governance practices provide more scope than traditional authority structures for interactions between actors from diff erent geographical scales. It is also possible to observe how water resources issues connect actors from diff erent scales and how, as a result, new spaces for negotiation are created across the established scales. Th ese dynamics refl ect an understanding of scales as socially constructed, the joint result of social and environmental relations. Th e confi guration of scales is adjusted when the fl ows of power change, reducing the impor-tance and infl uence of some geographical scales while  strengthening 202 V.L. Empinottiothers (Cox  1998 ; Marston  2000 ). At the same time, these new con-fi gurations can create dynamic scalar policies, namely the emergence of new relationships, practices, and processes that evolve through diff erent combinations of scales and that are transformed over time (MacKinnon  2011 ; McCarthy  2005 ). Such dynamics are part of governance practices, given that decision-makers activate the networks that allow scales to be transcended (Himley  2008 ).  Consequently, the existing hierarchy of scales may come under pressure as a result of new approaches to water governance and the range of new relationships centered on the management of water resources. Th ere are many factors that infl uence the scaling of water governance beyond the hydrological scale, as in the case of irrigation schemes; these factors include historical practices and relationships governing access to water, such as tensions between urban and rural areas, and social structures organized in response to the multiple pressures limiting access to this natural resource (Perreault  2015 ). It is from this critical perspective that we will examine a case where converging scales of water governance have been constructed in the Upper Xingu River Basin, one of Brazil’s main agricultural frontier regions. As management processes and social relations are scaled in diff er-ent ways, these reveal how power is shared unevenly between social actors and the consequent repercussions in terms of water allocation and use.      The Upper Xingu as a New Stage for Environmental Governance Practices  Th e transformation of the Upper Xingu region, in the state of Mato Grosso, into one of Brazil’s main production areas for agricultural com-modities began in the 1950s with the implementation of a series of agrar-ian reform and rural settlement projects (Barrozo  2010 ). Th ese programs had their heyday in the 1970s and 1980s with the mass migration of  subsistence farmers from southern Brazil, as well as the establishment of large agricultural companies (entitled to receive generous govern-ment subsidies). (See more on Mato Grosso’s agricultural development in Chap.   9    ). Th e colonization processes that followed the moderniza-tion development approach assumed that small farms (land areas smaller 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 203than two hectares) were not appropriate for modern agriculture, mainly due to the production scale necessary for this practice. Because of that, the Brazilian State promoted the occupation of indigenous land in Mato Grosso, which was regarded as empty space by Brazilian institutions at the time, 1  to allow for property areas of medium to large size (Ianni  1979 ). Th is process led to a radical transformation of the local and regional land-scape due to high rates of deforestation and the introduction of crops (initially rice), beef cattle production, and, fi nally, the intensifi cation of soybean and corn plantation farms (Ianni  1979 ; Empinotti  2015 ).  Consequently, new groups of landowners emerged in the region as ascendant small-scale farmers and entrepreneurial farmers. Coming mainly from the south of Brazil, these ascendant farmers were able to buy areas between 200 and 400 hectares through private colonization programs (Jepson  2006 ). Between 1970 and 1990, 35 private enterprises organized 104 settlement projects and colonized 3.9 million hectares of land in Mato Grosso alone (Jepson  2006 ). Such transformations fre-quently led to social confl icts in the region as a result of violence against rural laborers and traditional and indigenous communities, as well as state corruption (Barrozo  2010 ). Th is trend toward production and mar-ket intensifi cation has increased over the past two decades with a world-wide growth in demand for soybeans, particularly and increasingly from China (Hetch and Mann  2008 ). At the same time, the diversifi cation of agricultural activities in the region has created new urban centers, as well as an increasingly diverse labor market and an expanding service sector. Today, 70 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the state of Mato Grosso, where the Upper Xingu region is located, comes from agricul-tural activities (IBGE  2012 ).  It is probable that such changes in economic practices in the region are exerting infl uence on local leaders and their agendas, and on institutional arrangements (which are often informal), resulting in signifi cant impacts on the appropriation and use of natural resources, where the main goal is to intensify food production and commodities exports. In the state 1   Th ere is an extensive body of literature discussing the impact of land colonization processes in the Amazon region, as well as the specifi c impact on indigenous populations (Lévi-Strauss  1971 ; Villas-Bôas and Villas-Bôas  1994 ; Harres and Joanoni Neto  2009 ). 204 V.L. Empinottiof Mato Grosso, currently the main area of agribusiness expansion in Brazil, neoliberal principles are shaping agricultural practices as well as the landscape. Recognizing this fact means acknowledging the key role played by such principles in the Brazilian political and economic con-text, as the Brazilian government and the country’s business associations regard agribusiness practices as one of the most progressive elements of the emerging economy represented by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries (Ioris  2015 ).  Environmental issues were not a major consideration for most farmers until the 2000s, when monitoring of deforestation in the Amazon region was intensifi ed (Macedo et al.  2012 ), and water issues have tended to be even lower on the agenda. Even though the state of Mato Grosso is a net exporter of water to other parts of Brazil because of its agricultural activi-ties and the presence of large water bodies, including the headwaters of major rivers such as the Xingu, Paraguay, and Tapajós, water system man-agement has barely been implemented in the state (Mato Grosso  2009 ). Th e state apparatus in Mato Grosso has taken little action to reform water resources management beyond the preparation of guiding documents and the creation of a participatory collegiate. According to technical staff  at the Secretariat of the Environment, interviewed for the purpose of our research, this situation refl ects a general lack of interest in the water resources management agenda and its legal framework; in the environ-mental realm, attention tends to be focused more on the problem of deforestation. As an agricultural frontier area, the Upper Xingu region has undergone high rates of deforestation over the last four decades as inten-sive agricultural production has been introduced (Galford et al.  2010 ; Macedo et al.  2012 ), and there is growing pressure from both national and international groups to reduce deforestation and prioritize the recov-ery of native vegetation, as defi ned by the Brazilian Forest Code. 2   Th us, as the state responds to external pressures when determining its priorities for action, the water resources agenda is regarded as second-ary. Furthermore, in a state where more than 50 % of GDP comes from 2   Since 1965, the Forest Code (Law 4771) has determined the amount of native vegetation to be preserved in rural private properties in Brazil. In 2012, because of the high levels of controversy involved and under pressure from the rural sector, two new versions of the Forest Code were aproved in the same year (Laws 12651 and 12727). 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 205agriculture, the Secretariat of the Environment and its areas of responsi-bility occupy a relatively marginal position in the public administration structure, as refl ected in the limited resources and insuffi  cient numbers of qualifi ed staff  allocated to the department. Th e water resources agenda receives more attention in areas where there are confl icts over water access, as in some western areas of the state; according to water regulators, it is demands for intervention, from municipal government for example, that direct implementation and regulation of state and national water resources policy in Mato Grosso. Th is weak water governance by state agencies in Mato Grosso refl ects the infl uence of the prevailing neoliberal agribusiness model in the region.  In his provocative article, Ioris ( 2015 ) argues that the transformation of Mato Grosso by agribusiness practices is an example of a case in which capitalist institutions are undergoing renovation processes but without dismissing the reproduction of old practices. In this context, market roles prevail over the commons and any other reference that goes against mod-ernization and liberalization. Assuming such an analysis, we would expect that private sector interest and civil society organizations would prevail over state actors. In a neoliberal context, governance would be under-stood as a tool to promote effi  ciency over state practices and the control of costs as part of the decentralization of decision-making processes and the weakening of state infl uence. In this regard, it is expected that water management practices in Mato Grosso will indicate a new trend in which fl ows of power will mainly be infl uenced by traders, farmers, and their associations. Under this type of governance, state agencies are weak actors and the prevailing agenda is centered on the market and its established actors, as discussed in the following sections.      Water Management in the Upper Xingu: The Role of State Agencies  Until 1997, water in Brazil was managed by the federal government as a technocratic and centralized matter in which the main goal was energy production. Following the approval of Water Law 9433, the approach changed, part of a wave of institutional water reforms happening all over 206 V.L. EmpinottiLatin America and in other parts of the world (Jacobi et al.  2014 ). Th e law decentralized decision-making processes, created participatory insti-tutions responsible for managing water, and recognized water’s multiple uses. Water was now considered a public good, but one with economic value, and in order to guarantee the availability and quality of water, the law created management tools such as water rights, bulk water pricing, water plans, and an information system. From 1997 onward, every state in the country was responsible for creating its own state law, mirroring the federal one (Abers and Keck  2013 ). Th is innovative approach allowed for the participation of civil society organizations and users who, together with state agencies, formed water councils and watershed committees responsible for mediating confl icts, creating norms and regulations, defi n-ing the bulk price of water, and approving the water management plan, a document to advise the state on actions and practices. Th e Brazilian Water Law is one of the most advanced in the world, and became a refer-ence for other Latin American countries (Jacobi et al.  2014 ).  However, despite its commitment to participatory democracy prac-tices, the new Water Law also has limitations. Even though it recognizes multiple water uses, it does not incorporate the importance of land use and its impact on water availability and quality. Also, by considering watersheds as planning units, it created new territories that do not fol-low political and social boundaries. People are brought together through identifying common problems and solutions to these problems, and this does not necessarily occur in one particular watershed. Also, the law does not recognize the diff erent nuances of watersheds that cover mainly urban areas compared with those that are predominantly rural. Such spaces will have totally diff erent political and economic dynamics, as well as their own particular problems that demand specifi c tools and management practices. Finally, the costs of bringing together watershed committee members are high, particularly in watersheds covering large areas with low population density and few economic activities, such as those in central and northern parts of the country.  Mato Grosso exemplifi es the diffi  culties faced in implementing the Water Law in Brazil. Th e water resources management framework in the state is one of the weakest in Brazil (ANA  2012 ). Although Law 9945 (the State Law on Water Resources), which enshrined the Water 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 207Law in state legislation, was approved in 1997, the implementation of management tools has been remarkably slow. Mato Grosso’s fi rst State Water Resources Plan was only introduced in 2009, and out of its 27 water planning and management units, only two have basin committees (Sepotuba and Covapé). Th e State Water Resources Council was created, through Decree 2707, in 2010, a further example of how long it has taken for comprehensive control of water resources management to be implemented in Mato Grosso.  However, it is also important to acknowledge that the reasons for this go beyond the diffi  culties in adjusting such a model to the Amazon con-text. State practices and presence in the region also contributed to this result. In the specifi c case of the Upper Xingu watershed, the absence of any basin committee or signifi cant discussion of new management tools refl ects the limited state governmental presence in the region. Currently, the nearest offi  ce of the Secretariat of the Environment is located in the municipality of Barra do Garças, which is located 326 km from Canarana, in the Tocantins and Araguaia basin (ANA  2009 ). Th e main access route to the east side is national motorway BR-158, which connects Altamira in Pará to Santana do Livramento in Rio Grande do Sul, crossing the area between the Xingu and Tocantins and Araguaia river basins. Th is corri-dor is now known as the ‘Valley of the Forgotten’ due to the lack of atten-tion paid to it by state and federal governments over the last 20 years. As a result, infrastructure in the area tends to be inadequate, land disputes are poorly mediated, laws are not adequately enforced, and businesses have been able to take over the land belonging to indigenous groups and small-scale farmers with few consequences.  Th e region’s relative isolation and the lack of state government pres-ence refl ect the initial role of federal agencies in the organization of the territory since the 1950s, as discussed above. Starting in the late 1970s, federal agencies such as INCRA (the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) coordinated settlement projects in parts of the region. In addition, the creation of the Xingu National Park in 1961cre-ated a signifi cant role for FUNAI (the National Indian Foundation). More recently, because the region is a strategic area for the country in terms of water resources and energy generation, the Civil Cabinet at the Ministry of the Environment prepared a Sustainable Regional Development Plan 208 V.L. Empinotti(PDRS) in 2009 (Federal Decree 7340), which aims to promote public policies aimed at improving quality of life for the area’s inhabitants.  Th e Brazilian Constitution of 1988 stipulates that the federal govern-ment and its agencies are responsible for the country’s rural areas. As most of Mato Grosso is rural, federal agencies have a major institutional role in the state, and the relationship between national and municipal bodies is key to achieving transformation in the region. In practice, how-ever, although the federal bureaucratic scale has decisive infl uence, federal agencies do not have a major physical presence in the state; their infl u-ence is mainly exerted through regulations, programs, and incentive poli-cies, while meetings between the key social actors normally take place in Brasília rather than in Mato Grosso itself.  In 2010, in response to the slow implementation of the National Water Resources Policy in the northern region of Brazil, the National Water Agency (ANA) published the Strategic Plan for Water Resources in the Amazon Basin and Right Riverbank Tributaries, covering 2.55 mil-lion km 2  in the states of Mato Grosso, Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará, and Acre (ANA  2009 ). Despite the Water Law’s stipulation that individual basin committees are responsible for preparing and implementing plans for their own basins, this plan was drawn up almost exclusively by the ANA, with limited input from civil society representatives, users, and the states concerned. Th e justifi cation for such an initiative was the need for a document to guide water management in the region given the strategic importance of water resources and because Mato Grosso has a high con-centration of areas that are home to indigenous peoples, as well as being an agricultural frontier region and one with great potential for hydroelec-tricity generation (ANA  2009 ).  Th e area that includes the municipalities of Canarana, Água Boa, and Querência, where the empirical part of our study was conducted, does not yet have a basin committee, and the state and federal government agencies responsible for water regulation do not have a presence in the region. Th e area exemplifi es the dynamics of landscape transformation and appropriation of natural resources as a result of agricultural frontier expansion and the modernization process (Empinotti  2015 ). As well as being one of Brazil’s major soybean production areas, the municipalities contain the headwaters of the Xingu River and several of its  tributaries. 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 209Despite this, the debate on water resources has tended to be less of a priority in the area compared with pressing demands for better roads and production logistics and the question of how to deal with high rates of legal and illegal deforestation. Th us, without the participation and commitment of federal agencies such as the ANA and the Environment Ministry, institutions and water management tools have not yet been cre-ated in the Upper Xingu, leaving space for other social actors to lead this process and interpret water governance practices in their own way.  What is revealed here goes beyond the discussion of whether the Water Law is being implemented in Mato Grosso or not. What we can observe is that the weak presence of state agencies leading the implementation of formal institutional water arrangements has led to the birth of an endog-enous water agenda. Such dynamics have promoted new alliances and networks that refl ect new scales of action as well as the ways in which social actors and market forces understand and treat water issues. Finally, the history of the region and the absence of state agencies, the pioneering practices of land occupation and use, the presence of inequality, and the disregard for land rights, combined with pressure from environmentalists in the region, have created a unique context for understanding how water governance practices appear. Th e questions explored below will help us understand the dynamics present in water governance practices where state representatives are overpowered by private sector agents and civil society organizations.      How the Practice of Water Governance Has Evolved in the Upper Xingu: The Role of Global and Local Social Actors  Th e limited presence of state and federal management agencies in the Upper Xingu region has allowed a range of other actors to create envi-ronmental governance processes in the region. Environmental NGOs, both national and international, have played an important role, with their actions directed mainly toward ensuring that agricultural businesses comply with legal specifi cations. Th e purpose of some of these NGOs, such as the Earth Innovation Institute and the Earth Alliance, is to create 210 V.L. Empinotticonditions for sustainable commodity production, including the adapta-tion of production practices so that market certifi cation can be obtained. Such initiatives are usually aimed at medium and large-scale landowners and commodity exporters, and have encouraged many such businesses to implement sustainable farming practices, creating conditions that could, in principle, reconcile agricultural production and high-tech agricul-ture with environmental preservation. Th e main strategy at local level is to develop farmers’ technical capacities and to ensure that the relevant legislation on land use and access to natural resources is respected. In the case of the North American organization Th e Nature Conservancy (TNC), which has been very active in Mato Grosso, the intention has been to work together with the municipal authorities in support of the Rural Environmental Cadastre (CAR), as stipulated in the new Forest Code, thereby contributing to data collection and to the production of a national database which will eventually facilitate the monitoring of native vegetation, as stipulated in the law, and inform the application of penal-ties and sanctions.  Th e Brazilian NGOs in the region have tended to work independently, but their projects have much in common with the agenda of the inter-national NGOs in that that they also promote the implementation and strengthening of environmental protection measures included in laws such as the Forest Code. Th ey normally work in partnership with local gov-ernments and their agriculture departments. Two major programs were the Y Ikatu Xingu 3  campaign and the Xingu Seeds Network, both led by the Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) [Socio-environmental Institute]. Th e goal of the campaign was to work toward the recovery and protection of springs and headwaters in the Xingu River. Th e strategy involved creat-ing spaces for dialog between farmers from diff erent production scales, leaders of indigenous groups, environmentalists, and representatives of government agencies and civil society. Action was focused on forest resto-ration, agroforestry education, and territorial planning and management. Apart from the ISA, partners in this initiative included the Union of Lucas do Rio Verde Rural Workers (STR—LRV), the Mato Grosso Forum for 3   Th e expression  Y Ikatu Xingu , in the kamayurá language (one of the many languages spoken in the National Park), means ‘save the good waters of Xingu’. 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 211Environment and Development (FORMAD), the Life Centre Institute (LCI), and the Amazon Institute of Environmental Research (IPAM). An important outcome of the campaign was the creation of the consortium Forest Governance of the Xingu Headwaters, funded by the European Community, which was intended to stimulate environmental initiatives and promote agroforestry systems in the region. Th e initiatives have devel-oped programs that work with indigenous communities to restore springs on farms and to produce seeds and tree seedlings to be used in the restora-tion of riparian forests, as stipulated in the 2012 Forest Code.  It is possible to identify two typical characteristics of this emerging environmental governance in the region: fi rst, that it is conducted by NGOs, which have become mediators between local farmers and interna-tional networks working together to promote sustainability. However, it is important to note that the NGOs do not directly use water resources laws as guidance when planning their activities and projects. Consequently, improved access to water and improved water quality are simply extra benefi ts resulting from the protection of river headwaters and riparian forests, as required by the Forest Code. In addition, NGOs do not usu-ally invoke or discuss the importance of creating participatory forums where decisions on water resources management can be taken in the pres-ence of representatives from diff erent sections of society, and they do not offi  cially endorse the strategies for water allocation and  management included in the legislation, such as water use charges (i.e. the principle of ‘the user [or polluter] pays’).  Second, because of the prominence of NGOs in the Upper Xingu, the role of state representatives as social actors in governance processes is very limited. In the current context, the rules for water resources man-agement and their formal instruments were introduced through federal and state policies and legislation, while locally, the preservation of head-waters and riparian vegetation are led by national and international civil society organizations. State agencies are mainly present at the municipal level through partnerships with local governments and their agriculture departments, which act as interlocutors between local farmers, indigenous peoples, traditional communities, and national and international NGOs. Th e dynamics of scale operate in the consolidation and reinforcement of common agendas, which translate into actions at international, national, 212 V.L. Empinottiand local levels. Th erefore, governance occurs at various scales, while the role of the state is most evident at the national scale through the interven-tion of federal regulatory agencies. Th e impact of the federal state in rural areas follows this dynamic scaling. In practice, the actions of the state are not having an impact on the stakeholders who manage and use water on a daily basis; that is, the institutional arrangements that would support these practices and rules are not being translated into tangible results.  At the same time, federal and state agencies use watershed boundaries to determine management units, while NGOs defi ne their territory of action from the perspective of rivers, riverbeds, and headwaters, and also take into account the social and physical transformation of the landscape due to the deforestation and the expansion of agriculture. Such a dynam-ics refl ects the fact that the water management agenda is directly associ-ated with changes in land use, given that variations in the quality and quantity of water in water bodies are a consequence of changes in land-scape and land use. Th is basic understanding has not guided Brazilian legislation on water resources, which, while considering the river basin as a management unit, has developed its instruments and regulations based on practices that only focus on river fl ows, water quality, and water with-drawn. Th e participation of farmers’ organizations in water governance is still in its early stages. For these groups, problems with water represent a direct threat to their agricultural production activities, even though these same problems are themselves likely to be a consequence of intensive farming practices, which have a major impact on the quantity and quality of water available in the region. But these groups focus mainly on actions that can help farmers to comply with current laws, since failure to do this can lead to sanctions such as suspension of incentives or access to credit, or even rejection of farmers’ goods on international markets.  It should also be noted that farmers are largely unaware of the water management system proposed by the Water Law, and as a result, they often simply have no opinion about it. On the other hand, the Brazilian NGOs that work in the region acknowledge the water management sys-tem; they even participate as members in other regions, but do not see themselves as the ones pushing for it in the Upper Xingu River Basin. Such realities expose the diff erent ways in which these organizations defi ne water issues, going beyond water quality and quantity to deal with 8 Water Governance in the Upper Xingu River Basin, Brazil 213how water is integrated into land use practices. Th ey also reveal a limita-tion of the Water Law: it does not off er spaces for negotiation in which environmental problems can be fully discussed while considering the social actors’ interests and concerns. Th e lack of trust in state agencies and the state’s history of corruption and human rights violations push such organizations to create diff erent paths in order to avoid the infl u-ence of the established power structures. Finally, international NGOs and traders are committed to market rules and strategies that guarantee the trading capacity of commodities from Mato Grosso. It is not the Brazilian Water Law that pushes for their action and commitment, but rather market opportunities.      Conclusions  In areas where the formal institutional arrangement proposed by Law 9433 has not been consolidated, as in the case of the Upper Xingu, it is interesting to observe how actions across diff erent scales exert direct and indirect infl uence on the management of water resources. Th ere are sev-eral important conclusions to be drawn from this situation. Th e territory of action is determined depending on the factors that unite the actors involved, in this case farmers, local governments, and national and inter-national NGOs. Th ese groups have been motivated to act by changes to agricultural production practices in accordance with legal and/or envi-ronmental parameters, such as the Forest Code, whereby the recovery and care of permanent protected areas contributes to the maintenance of water availability and water quality in the region. Th erefore, the river basin can be formally considered to be the unit of action and manage-ment at local and regional level, but the actors involved tend to be located in other countries, which adds a global component to local action, taking it beyond the physical boundaries of the basin. Consumption and pro-duction networks are the main determinants in the construction of scales within which various practices infl uence water availability and quality. Th ese facts corroborate the understanding that social and economic fac-tors can challenge the biophysical boundaries of the watershed as a plan-ning unit (Ferreyra et al.  2008 ; Cohen and Davidson  2011 ). At the same 214 V.L. Empinottitime, socio-ecological dynamics in the region provide the opportunity to study the adoption of novel water governance practices at scales where the state is less infl uential and private agents and NGOs become the main protagonists.  It is also crucial to observe that because of the absence of formal water governance arrangements, the water resources agenda in the region is guided by pressure on land use, the opening of new production areas, and the resulting deforestation and disregard for the preservation parameters of native vegetation. Th is means that water governance is linked to issues of land use, as well as to the growing involvement of new actors with roles related to water allocation, use, and management. Th e scale of action has not followed formal regulations, but has instead created a new rationale, which should be regarded as a reference for thinking about such prac-tices in the agricultural frontier context. Finally, where the fact that a region is an agricultural frontier is a defi ning factor in how it functions, the agribusiness sector tends to be the most infl uential, although global environmental networks are also prominent. Putting their agendas into practice leads to biophysical and political landscape transformations in addition to the attempts to promote water governance practices. In this case, water governance aims to regularize agricultural activities and their certifi cation, ensuring that agribusiness commits to fi nding a balance between optimal production and environmental conservation, which will ultimately lead to better conservation practices and the protection of water bodies in the region.

R.     Ioris             Introduction  As discussed in detail in the other chapters in this book, although  agricultural production has increased considerably in absolute terms since the post-World War II years, various problems continue to aff ect the agriculture industry’s image worldwide. Th ese problems include a lack of access to aff ordable, nutritious food in many countries; the impacts of agrochemicals on communities and ecosystems; and the enormous concentration of power held by a small number of mega-supermarkets and agri-food corporations to control food production, distribution, and consumption. Th ere is a growing understanding today that the increas-ing industrialization of agriculture represents an important chapter, perhaps the most important, in the renovation of the global capitalist economy (Busch and Bain  2004 ) and, in particular, the transition to         A.  A.  R.   Ioris      ((cid:13))   University of Edinburgh ,   Edinburgh ,  UK     post-Fordist modes of production under the sphere of infl uence of glo-balization and neoliberalism (McMichael  2009 ). If neoliberalism—as a complex, inherently variegated ideology of critical importance across scales and regions (MacArtney  2009 )—comprises beliefs and practices centred on the idea that market effi  ciency is the best mechanism for regulating socio- economic relations and renovating politico-economic strategies (Schmalz and Ebenau  2012 ), agro-neoliberalism is a highly idiosyncratic phenomenon that combines free-market pressures and fl exibilization approaches with renewed forms of protectionism, trade barriers, and labour movement restrictions (Potter and Tilzey  2005 ). Agro-neoliberalism is essentially a politicized ideology that ultimately deepens the contradictions of capitalism across time and space (Araghi  2003 ), such as the disturbing contrast between southern areas of produc-tion (and environmental degradation) and northern spaces of consump-tion (and capital accumulation).  Th e complex role of agriculture in the expansion of industrial and post- industrial societies has been a favourite research topic for schol-ars interested in the patterns and perspectives of present-day neoliberal capitalism. Th is chapter off ers further critical investigation into the overall trends of agrarian neoliberalism and the persistence of its politi-cal means and ideological mechanisms alongside forces of change. Th e chapter’s departure point is that neoliberalized agriculture entails pro-cesses ranging from adjustments to small-scale farming and local econo-mies to the escalation of agro-industrial production, the monopolization of trade (upstream and downstream to the farm gate and the house-hold), the widespread fi nancialization of agriculture (including future markets and agriculture derivatives), and the subjugation of public poli-cies to strong market pressures (Clapp and Fuchs  2009 ). As a result, contemporary agri-food systems are increasingly tending to focus on short-term economic gains and the legitimization of political hegemo-nies at the expense of issues of nourishment and health (Goodman and Watts  1997 ). Particularly in Latin America, agribusiness has become the embodiment of aggressive processes of commodity export, land con-centration or re-concentration, marginalization, and proletarianization (Murray  2006 ). Various types of power work together in the region, from instrumental and discursive rationality to structural manifestations 222 A.A.R. Iorisof political control deciding what is produced and what sort of food is consumed (Newell  2009 ).  Th e focus of the present analysis is on the modernization and inten-sifi cation of agribusiness in Brazil, as an entry point into the politicized geographies of globalized agri-food and into the complexity of agro- neoliberalism at national and subnational levels. Because of new produc-tion areas and growing productivity, Brazil has consolidated its position as a global leader, and even as a ‘model’ of commercial, integrated crop pro-duction (Collier  2008 ). Unlike other economic sectors (such as industrial production and the retail market), agribusiness is considered an island of prosperity and economic dynamism, and is currently claimed to be the ‘main business of Brazil’ (Furtado  2002 : 203). It should be noted that, due to promotional campaigns and assertive public policies, the term ‘agribusiness’ has a particularly positive, and strategic, meaning in Brazil, where it is commonly used in reference to large plantation farms (and, to a lesser extent, in reference to food processing and trading companies typically found in the USA). More importantly, although the expansion of agribusiness has proved to be central to Brazil’s participation in global-ized markets, the expansion of agribusiness has revealed a peculiar amal-gamation of tradition and (conservative) modernity, evolving through new social orders and old political structures and vividly present in the practices of infl uential landowners and in the discourse of their represen-tatives in the National Congress (Bruno  2009 ).  What follows in the next pages is a space-sensitive assessment and the-orization of social relations and socio-economic trends across diff erent scales, which, according to Callinicos ( 2007 ), should concentrate on the main dimensions of power, especially economic activity, ideologies, and various patterns of political domination. Another main objective here is to discuss the emblematic situation of the State of Mato Grosso, in the Centre-West region, which since the 1990s has become one of the main hubs of agro-neoliberalism in the world; more than ten million hectares of soybean, cotton, and maize have replaced massive areas previ-ously covered by  cerrado  [savannah] and forest ecosystems. From being a region with relatively low levels of isolated economic activity, Mato Grosso is now at the core of national economic life and plays a key role in Brazilian exports and global agri-food markets (the state is responsible for 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 223around 10 % of global soybean production, for example). Nonetheless, although Mato Grosso has been transformed by the expansion and grad-ual consolidation of agribusiness in recent decades, it remains a material and symbolic agricultural frontier. Also, while new agricultural areas are currently developing in other Brazilian states, planned improvements in transportation and logistics (jointly by public and private companies) are likely to trigger new rounds of socio-spatial transformation.  Th e discussion is based on three fi eldwork campaigns conducted between 2013 and 2015, which comprised repeated visits to cropping areas, private companies, research centres (such as Embrapa), indigenous and subsistence farming communities, attendance at public meetings, and 21 interviews carried out in the States of São Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and, particularly, Mato Grosso (in the municipalities of Cuiabá, Rondonópolis, Sinop, Cláudia, Porto dos Gaúchos, Lucas do Rio Verde, and Sorriso). Th e research strategy consisted of an ‘embedded case study’, which started by considering subunits of social action; these were then scaled up to identify common patterns in larger geographical spheres. With the help of local academics at the universities UFMT (Federal University of Mato Grosso) and UNEMAT (State University of Mato Grosso), interviewees and informants were identifi ed, initial contacts were set up, and the research then followed a snowball approach. Based on preliminary information, a database was developed to guide further interviews, documentation analysis, and the collection of background information. With the mapping of sectors and organizations, their dis-course, and stated aims, it was possible to compare intra- and inter-group diff erences and the range of alliances or disputes (ranging from those strongly against to others fi ercely in favour of the prevailing agri-food system). Semi-structured interviews were complemented with analysis of documents, statistics, websites, leafl ets, presentations, and newspaper articles found in university libraries and in the archives of public agencies and private entities. Interviews and other qualitative material were tran-scribed, coded, and assessed in Portuguese; only the extracts reproduced in this chapter were translated into English.  Empirical results, as analysed below, principally show some fun-damental contradictions and signs of exhaustion in Brazilian agro- neoliberalism, despite its current status as a dominant ideology. While the neoliberal agribusiness sector has succeeded in crafting a positive 224 A.A.R. Iorisimage of  technological and economic success, the federal government and the wider business community have become highly dependent on the export of primary commodities (to safeguard the national cur-rency and avoid trade defi cits, for example). Th e economic hypertro-phy of agribusiness in Brazil has also resulted in a situation where rural leaders are disproportionately infl uential in politics, particularly in the National Congress and the Ministry of Agriculture, where they attempt to advance conservative agendas and secure further concessions from the government. Agro-neoliberalism evolves not only through attempts to infl uence the government, but also through further modifi cation to the structure and rationale of the state. As part of this turbulent and con-troversial process, new production areas are being incorporated with the employment of old and new practices of socio-environmental manage-ment and political legitimization. It is particularly in agricultural frontier areas, such as Mato Grosso, that the philosophy of agro-neoliberalism is used to combine populist and developmentalist traditions in order to disguise mounting impacts and inequalities. Ironically, when facing criti-cism from other social forces in the country, the agribusiness sector reacts with a pre-established rhetoric of heroism and entrepreneurialism that, in the end, serves the corporations and national politicians more than the farmers themselves. It is similar to what happened with small producers in the USA, who were once considered the backbone of democracy but are no longer at the heart of US politics. It is to the contentious ongoing experience in South America that we now turn.      Brazil and the Realization of Agro-neoliberalism  Brazilian agriculture has evolved, since colonial times, through the associ-ation of export crops and subsistence farming, as a political compromise dominated by powerful rural elites in strong alliance with the appara-tus of the state (Oliveira  2007 ). By the fi rst decades of the last  century, modern production technologies were already being systematically transferred from the Global North (the main agriculture colleges and research centres were established during this period), without altering the overall balance of agrarian power between large-scale and subsistence 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 225farmers. Agricultural modernization and rural development received a new stimulus during the 21-year military dictatorship (1964–1985), with the incorporation of diff erent forms of capital, new methods of pro-duction, and the formation of agro-industrial chains (Gonçalves Neto  1997 ). Priority was given by the authoritarian governments of the time to national developmentalist policies inspired by Keynesian ideas (Graziano da Silva  1988 ); these involved the adoption of fi scal incentives, subsi-dized credit, and effi  ciency measures, and the integration of farming and industry (Delgado  2012 ). Crop production was promoted by the fed-eral government throughout the country, along with related processes of land cover and socio-ecological change (Oliveira and Stédile  2005 ), as an ‘anti-agrarian’ reform that further concentrated land ownership and rein-forced old agrarian trends along the lines described by Araghi ( 2009 ) as ‘accumulation by displacement’, predicated on the dispossession of small farmers and encroachment on natural vegetation.  After achieving remarkable rates of production growth in the 1970s, the state-centralized mode of agricultural intensifi cation started to show serious limitations, particularly as Brazil was suff ering from a public debt crisis, escalating rates of infl ation, and macroeconomic instability. Th e Brazilian agriculture sector went through a period of turbulence and uncertainty beginning in the mid-1980s due to the reduction of sup-port schemes (e.g. guaranteed prices), signifi cantly higher interest rates, and a paucity of bank loans. Th at prompted the transition to what is described by Campanhola and Graziano da Silva ( 2000 ) as a ‘new rural model’, characterized by higher levels of agro-industrial integration, more direct intervention from large corporations (including production funding), and multipurpose agriculture technologies. Th is new model was directly associated with neoliberal reforms to the state and economy during the 1990s. Infl ation reduction and macroeconomic stabilization policies—known as the Real Plan, launched in 1994 and maintained by President Cardoso (1995–2002)—strengthened the national cur-rency, the real (R$), and facilitated agro-industrial imports, while creat-ing  circumstantial barriers to the export of Brazilian goods for most of the decade (Ioris and Ioris  2013 ). A serious trade imbalance, together with higher interest rates, led to a temporary reduction in agricultural profi tability and a lowering of land prices; nonetheless, it also paved the 226 A.A.R. Iorisway for the advancement of agro-neoliberalism as an alternative strat-egy for the revitalization of national agriculture. Production of crops for export was also encouraged by more favourable exchange rates follow-ing the 1999 devaluation of the Brazilian currency (Siqueira  2004 ) and by extraordinarily favourable commodity prices in global markets during the early 2000s (Richards et al.  2012 ). Th e results were highly positive and Brazilian agribusiness accounts now for approximately 25 % of gross domestic product (GDP), 35 % of exports, and 40 % of national jobs in the country (MAPA  2012 ).  Th e speedy recovery of Brazilian agriculture, following neoliberaliz-ing priorities, was enabled by a combination of public and private mea-sures (Petras and Veltmeyer  2003 ). Th e state remained fi rmly in charge of rural development (Schneider  2010 ), but at the same time forged close partnerships with an ever-stronger private agribusiness sector. Since that time, both transnational (Monsanto, ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Dreyfus, etc.) and new national corporations (Amaggi, BR Foods, JBS, Marfrig, etc.) have played an increasingly decisive role in terms of policy planning and eff orts to grow business. Under the populist, neo-devel-opmentalist administrations of Presidents Lula and Dilma since 2003, agro- neoliberalism became more deeply entrenched and was enhanced by supplementary rural credit off ered by offi  cial banks (with annual interest rates of around 5 %, signifi cantly lower than the standard rates off ered by commercial banks). As a somewhat surprising, but integral, element of agro- neoliberalism, public credit increased from R$ 15 billion per year in the 1990s to R$ 136 billion in 2013 and R$ 156 billion in 2014 (O Estado de São Paulo  2014 ). However, a signifi cant proportion of rural credit has also been provided by transnational corporations and by a massive increase in bank-like transactions. Since the early 2000s, vari-ous new fi nancial instruments have been available, such as self-fi nancing, fi nancial cooperatives, input supplier companies, and trading companies, fi lling the gap created by the inadequacies of previous federal govern-ment–administered schemes (Serigati  2013 ). A notable example of the widespread fi nancialization of neoliberalized agriculture was the 2004 legislation that created the Agribusiness Receivables Certifi cate (CRA), among other titles traded on the São Paulo stock exchange. Th e CRA is a registered credit instrument which links a promise of future payment 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 227in cash to the debt claim issued by the securitization company (MAPA  2010 ). By 2013, the amount of traded CRAs reached R$ 1.2 billion (around US$ 550 million), but this is expected to expand 30 times more over the next few years (Isto É Dinheiro  2013 ).  Th e increased fi nancialization of crop production and distribution aff ected not only the relations of production, but directly transformed the nature and destination of what is produced. Government investments in agriculture-related infrastructure and technological development have become more selective, targeting primarily biofuel and export commodi-ties (Bernardes  1996 ). Related to policy adjustments, there has been a partial replacement of the previous North–South trade priority (especially with the European Union) with a growing South–South interconnection, particularly between Brazil and Asia (FIESP  2008 ). In particular, com-mercial exchanges between Brazil and China reached US$ 77 billion in 2011 (Brazil exported goods worth US$ 44.3 billion and imported goods worth US$ 32.8 billion), with agriculture-based exchanges growing from US$ 1.7 billion in 2003 to US$ 14.6 billion in 2011, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) ( 2012 ).  Th e Economist  ( 2010 ) even considers Brazil the fi rst tropical food giant, mainly because of the infl uence of Chinese demand. Soybean is by far the most important agricultural commodity in Brazil and the ‘soybean complex’ accounts for 80 % of agricultural exports to China. Soybean is not only an emblematic symbol of Brazilian agro-neoliberal modernity and of the success of production reorganization; soybean production also involves signifi cant geopolitical repercussions in terms of Brazil’s infl u-ence, especially in Africa and South America (Oliveira  2015 ).  Despite positive results in terms of increased production, fi nancing, and commercialization, however, the success of agribusiness has left the country dangerously over-reliant on primary commodities and on the appetites of distant markets. On the one hand, Brazil has become the main global exporter of soybean (contributing 44 million of the 105.1 million tons traded in 2013) and the soybean complex continues to expand unabated (8.2 % in 2011–2012 and 18.5 % in 2012–2013, when it accounted for almost US$ 31 billion of export revenues, accord-ing to CEPEA  2014 ). On the other hand, the Brazilian economy has faced progressive deindustrialization, increased dependence on foreign investments, and rising imports of intermediate inputs and capital goods. 228 A.A.R. IorisFrom 2004 to 2013, manufacturing dropped from 55.0 % to 38.4 % of GDP, while primary production increased from 29.5 % to 46.7 % (MDIC  2013 ). Between 2000 and 2010, export earnings from primary goods increased from 25 % to 45 %, while those from manufactured goods declined from 56 % to 43 % (Delgado  2012 ). After the 2008 global fi nancial crisis, the dependence of the Brazilian economy on the success of agribusiness extended even further as the export of agricultural commodities became the ‘green anchor’ of the economy (Acselrad  2012 ). Between 2012 and 2013, national exports fell by 0.2 %, but agribusi-ness exports increased by 4.3 %; in the same period, national imports increased by 7.4 % and agribusiness imports increased only by 4.0 % (CONAB  2014 ). In 2014, the trade balance showed the worst perfor-mance since 1998 (a defi cit of US$ 4.036 billion in 2014, according to the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade [MDIC] data-base), with agribusiness appearing as one of the few sectors with positive foreign exchange results.  It can be seen in Table  9.1  that, while agribusiness grew proportionally less than the national economy, and its percentage contribution to the national economy actually decreased between 2007 and 2013, its contri-bution to the national surplus (in dollar terms) was critical. Agricultural exports in 2013 reached a value of US$ 99.97 billion (4.3 % more than the previous year) with a net surplus (i.e. minus imports) of US$ 82.91 billion (including US$ 30.96 billion from soybean exports alone); fore-casts for the next few years indicate a continuing increase along the same lines (Agroanalysis  2014 ). Because the overall surplus of Brazilian trade was only US$ 2.2 billion, without the contribution of the agribusiness sector, the country would have faced a serious and embarrassing defi -   Table 9.1    Agribusiness and the Brazilian economy (2007–2013)    2007  2013  GDP Brazil (R$)  3.58 trillion  4.49 trillion  GDP agribusiness sector (R$)  833.6 billion  1.02 trillion  Participation of agribusiness in the Brazilian GDP (%)  23.30  22.80  National trade surplus (US$)  40.0 billion  2.2 billion  Agribusiness trade surplus (US$)  49.7 billion  82.9 billion   Data consolidated from various bulletins of CEPEA (Centre for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics), at the University of São Paulo)/SECEX (Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat)/Agroanalysis (monthly economic magazine)  9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 229cit. Th e help of agribusiness was even more impressive due to a decline of 7.5 % in the average price of commodities on international markets between 2012 and 2013 (Barros et al.  2014 ).   Figure  9.1  illustrates the fact that, while the diff erence between export and import values is dwindling in Brazil and even tending towards a negative result, the surplus (gross income, i.e. total exports minus total imports) produced by the agribusiness sector is positive and constantly growing. One of the most perverse consequences of the steady expansion of agribusiness surpluses is that the activity of the contemporary Brazilian state, which combines neoliberalizing priorities with elements of popu-lism and neo-Keynesianism, itself depends on agriculture to help manage the monumental public debt (around US$ 1 trillion in 2015) and to sus-tain politically relevant welfare-related programmes (such as the impor-tant cash transfer scheme known as  Bolsa Família  or family allowance).   Furthermore, the positive economic results produced by agribusiness have served to unify the interests of rural conservative groups and renew processes of political hegemony and class domination (Bruno  2009 ). It was highly symbolic of the political infl uence of agribusiness that President Lula started his fi rst term in offi  ce with the ‘Zero Hunger’ programme and ended his second mandate openly defending the  sector and making signifi -cant concessions on environmental  legislation (Canal Rural  2009 ). Because of its political signifi cance, the  agribusiness  sector has actively managed to protect its interests, especially with an organized and prominent  presence –5005010015020025030020002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013NaƟonalexportsNaƟonalimportsNaƟonalTrade balanceAgribusinessGross Income  Fig. 9.1    Brazil’s trade balance and the contribution of agribusiness (in bil-lions of dollars) ( Data Sources : CONAB/MAPA/Ministry of Development)        230 A.A.R. Iorisin the National Congress, where around one third of the senators and dep-uties belong to, or support, the Parliamentary Farming and Cattle Raising Front [ Frente Parlamentar da Agropecuária —FPA]. An important initia-tive of the FPA is the determined attempt to remove any environmental and social regulation that could prevent the expansion of production. Th e number of FPA parliamentarians actually increased following the 2014 general election. Th ey are led by the hard-line Senator Katia Abreu, presi-dent of the National Agriculture Confederation (Ms Abreu was re-elected in 2014 and became Secretary of State of Agriculture in the second Dilma government from January 2015 until May 2016 when the Brazilian Senate voted to remove the president from power). 1   Agribusiness is often seen by other groups as a debt-prone sector, with high environmental costs and unable to overcome production obsta-cles in a fair manner (Silva and Mello  2009 ). Th ere are growing ten-sions between global commodity chains led by Brazilian agribusinesses and social, grassroots movements that call for corporate responsibility, environmental protection, quality food, and labour rights (Wilkinson  2011 ). However, due to the vital role played by agribusiness in maintain-ing macroeconomic stability, and thanks to the political legitimization of populist governments, the sector has managed to secure increasing regulatory concessions (such as more fl exible labour and forestry legisla-tion) and its political capital has served to mitigate bad publicity gener-ated by environmental impacts and the regressive social agenda advanced by  representatives of agribusiness. Systematic campaigns orchestrated by representative entities (for instance, the Brazilian Agribusiness Association, the Brazilian Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock, and the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo) have tried to counter the prevalent image of large-scale farmers as perpetrators of injustice against small-scale farmers and indigenous groups and as major contributors to environmental damage in old and new production areas. Th e following interview extract illustrates this attempt to reinforce the economic relevance of agriculture and argue that the social and environ-mental costs are justifi ed:1   Senator Kátia Abreu repeatedly stated that environmental conservation aggravates the food crisis and that, consequently, climate change deserves much less attention from government and society alike ( Th e Guardian   2014 ). 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 231  Agribusiness is the main sector for FIESP [Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo], it is associated with the largest proportion of indus-tries. And Brazil is number one in global agriculture. Of course, we are a bit concerned about the ‘soyifi cation’ of Brazilian agribusiness, another problem that we can’t deny…and also the reduction of the industrial com-ponent of the rest of the economy. But in any case, we are really satisfi ed with the prices in the global markets and with the introduction of more reasonable environmental legislation in recent years, particularly the new Forest Code. (…) Th e main challenge now is to improve logistics, roads, ports, railways, etc. (Interview with a manger of the rural division of FIESP, São Paulo, April 2014)  Brazilian agro-neoliberalism has evolved through an intricate process of economic gain and aggressive modernization intermingled with sys-tematic attempts to conceal strategic alliances between populist authori-ties and market-friendly ideologies. Th e sector has maintained steady rates of expansion not only due to constant technological improvements (e.g. new agrochemicals, genetically modifi ed seeds, and more sophis-ticated machinery and digital equipment), but also because of further land grabbing and incursion into new production areas (Borras et al.  2012 ). Th e end result is a paradoxical combination of circumstantial profi tability and positive results with mounting socio-ecological risks and power concentrated in the hands of corporations and rural politi-cal leaders. Th e Brazilian region where the controversies related to agro-neoliberalism are most evident is the State of Mato Grosso in the Centre-West region, where more than half the economy is now based on agribusiness (IMEA  2014 ) and where the value of exports jumped from US$ 254 million to US$ 8.5 billion between 1990 and 2009 (Pereira  2012 ). Th e intensifi cation of agriculture in the state since the 1990s has revealed an idiosyncratic fusion of old habits and new, market-centred approaches, employed by the agribusiness sector in an attempt to con-solidate the agriculture frontier (initially opened in the 1970s). Mier y Terán (Mier  2014 ) rightly points out that agribusiness in Mato Grosso was never a uniform phenomenon, but has been shaped by local par-ticularities because of the heterogeneity of migrants, farming practices, market oscillation, and ecological specifi cities. During our research, it was possible to verify that agro-neoliberalism is being applied in the 232 A.A.R. Iorislocalized context of farms and regions, but management, technologies, and trade relations increasingly happen in accordance with globalized, transnational interactions and priorities. However, what is still missing in most available publications is an examination of the interconnected driving forces at this uneven agribusiness frontier (Ioris  2015 ); the goal of the next section is to provide such an examination.      Mato Grosso: The Core Area of Brazilian Agro-Neoliberalism     Men had greedily fi tted across this vastness but found nothing to root them. (…)  A man’s name did not last long in the Mato Grosso.  John Updike,  Brazil  (1994)  Th e reconfi guration of the patterns of agricultural production in Mato Grosso constitutes an emblematic example of the articulation of public and private agendas that shape agro-neoliberalism. Th e State of Mato Grosso (henceforth ‘MT’), in the hinterland of Brazil, is one of the most active areas of agricultural production for export in the world today, rep-resenting the culmination of the rural frontier fostered by the government over the past few decades. Since the post-World War II years, MT’s state government has been selling large plots of relatively cheap land (typically around 200,000 hectares) in order to secure revenues to run the public sector and to compensate for the limited fi nancial support received from the federal authorities (Moreno  2007 ). Th e agrarian transition took a new turn during the military dictatorship, which intensifi ed the occu-pation of new areas in MT through the construction of roads (e.g. the motorways BR-163 and BR-364), warehouses, and other related infra-structure. Direct federal interventions prompted a number of coloniza-tion projects in the 1970s and 1980s, which attracted  thousands of small famers and landless labourers from the south and northeast of Brazil. Th e areas used for colonization were previously held as semi-collective prop-erty by subsistence farmers or occupied by nomadic indigenous tribes. Yet, the offi  cial discourse defi ned these locations as ‘no man’s land’ or 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 233‘empty—territory’ waiting to be explored. In many cases, common land was grabbed using false documents, with the assistance of corrupt civil servants and allied political leaders (Souza  2013 ).  Despite the enthusiasm of the newcomers, the fi rst two decades of the new agriculture frontier could be hardly considered a success. On the contrary, farmers struggled to produce due to the lack of adapted technology, insuffi  cient preparation for diff erent agro-ecological condi-tions, diffi  culty selling their products, and erratic government support (Barrozo  2010 ). Technical and socio-ecological barriers faced by the new farmers coincided with the national economic crisis of the 1980s, when the government ran out of cash and defaulted on its payments. Many had to leave MT, either returning to their original home states or moving further into the Amazon region. Th e late 1980s and early 1990s was a period fraught with turbulence and uncertainty about the future of the agriculture frontier. Crucially, it was through the reinven-tion of the agriculture frontier along the lines of agro-neoliberalism that production managed to recover and ended up expanding at an unanticipated pace. Figure  9.2  shows, for instance, that MT has been the main producer of soybean in Brazil since 1999. Interestingly, the relentless increase of soybean production in MT was initially underesti-mated in most public and private projections, which did not anticipate the measures taken to overcome technical, economic, and sociopolitical diffi  culties (Warnken  2000 ).020,00,00040,00,00060,00,00080,00,0001,00,00,0001,20,00,0001,40,00,0001,60,00,0001,80,00,0002,00,00,0001962196419661968197019721974197619781980198219841986198819901992199419961998200020022004200620082010GoiásMato Grosso do SulMato GrossoParanáRio Grande do Sul  Fig. 9.2    Annual soybean production (tons) in the main Brazilian states ( Data source : IPEA)        234 A.A.R. Ioris   Th e celebrated success of agricultural recovery in MT is the result of a lucky convergence of political determination in the farming sector, the renewed interest of transnational corporations in the region, favour-able commodity prices, and, critically, the growing macroeconomic  importance of crop exports for the balance of trade. Agribusiness farmers in MT have been eager to capitalize on their success and quick to describe their activity as the ‘Brazil that is doing well’ ( Brazil que dá certo ), an idea that has been reinforced by government rhetoric and mass media cover-age. Expressions such as the ‘Brazil that is doing well’ end up working as a totalizing narrative that is repeatedly used by politicians and agribusi-ness groups even to explain such phenomena as the surprising victories of the small football team Luverdense, from the MT city of Lucas do Rio Verde, in a national football championship in 2013 (Terra  2013 ). According to the state association of crop producers, in ‘Mato Grosso, soybeans are synonymous with technology. Mato Grosso producers are renowned for using the most up-to-date technology, from planting to harvesting crops’ (Aprosoja-MT  n.d. : 22). 2  And, as claimed by ABAG (Brazilian Agribusiness Association), ‘soybean production was born mod-ern’ and it is a good example of the best the country can off er (Furtado  2002 : 135). Also during one of our fi eldwork studies (June 2014), the most infl uential Brazilian magazine,  Veja , was conducting a countrywide trip to visit the locations identifi ed as undisputed examples of economic achievement, which necessarily included agribusiness clusters in MT. 3   An intriguing dimension of the ideological construct of the success of agro-neoliberalism is a tendency to systematically blame the government for both large and small adversities. Despite the fact that agribusiness is deep in the pockets of transnational corporations—which fi nance pro-duction and acquire most of the goods produced—farmers paradoxically call on the state to correct market failures and, in bad years, to provide bailout funds (Peine  2010 ). In a context of strong agro-neoliberalism, farmers tend to easily accept the legitimacy of corporations and focus their criticism on the state for excessive social and environmental regula-2   Aprosoja-MT was established in 2005 at a moment when the costs of production had temporarily increased and farmers were dealing with losses caused by climatic adversities. 3   More information, maps, and pictures of the VEJA expedition at  http://veja.abril.com.br/tema/expedicao-veja 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 235tion or for its inability to understand their needs (cf. FAMATO  2014 ). A large-scale farmer (in the municipality of Sorriso, Dec. 2014) argued in an interview that he has ‘a good interaction with the “ tradings ” [trans- national corporations, or TNCs], they help with inputs and in some years with credit, but it is expense. But we lack viable options, we can’t really diversify. (…) In the end, the government is always guilty, because they pay little attention to our problems’. Related to that, agribusiness farmers have repeatedly attacked the federal government for insuffi  cient invest-ment in roads and, in particular, exerted pressure for privatization. As a result, 851 kilometres of the federal motorway BR-163 (which crosses the main production areas in MT) were transferred to a private operator (Odebrecht) in 2013, following the public–private collaborative strategy of President Dilma’s administration.  Nonetheless, although farmers frequently complain about the price of transporting grains to the international ports in the southeast of Brazil (around R$ 330 or US$ 140/ton), high transportation costs have not aff ected profi tability or the perennial search for new, more distant pro-duction areas. 4  One main reason for this is that logistical diffi  culties have been overcome with inexpensive land (at least during the coloniza-tion period), abundant natural resources, and cheap labour (it should be noted that even though agribusiness farms pay higher median wages than other comparable economic sectors, the labour-to-capital ratio is markedly low). It can be seen at the bottom of Table  9.2  that the rate of cropland area per employee increased signifi cantly between 1970 and 2006. Because of heavy machinery, it is now possible to cultivate very large tracts of land (many thousands of hectares) with a handful of per-manent and temporary workers. Th is is obviously part of the extraction of surplus value, and mitigates the increasing tendency to acquire capital in the form of additional farmland.   Labour accounts for less than 3.0 % of agricultural production costs in MT, while seed, fertilizer, and agrochemicals—generally sold by trans-national companies—represent 54.98 % of the total costs (fi gures from the production season 2014–2015, as presented in Table  9.3 ). Th is is 4   Since April 2014, fl uvial ports in the Amazon have become another viable alternative for the export of soybean coming from Mato Grosso and other states. 236 A.A.R.

A complex system is in place here, where continuity and change operate at diff erent scales—farm, state, and nation—and combine old patterns of socio-ecological exploi-tation with modern production and justifi cation approaches.   One the one hand, continuity is related to the concentration of agri-business in the hands of MT’s large proprietors. According to Werner ( 2011 ), 3.35 % of landowners control 61.57 % of the land (in many cases without adequate land deeds), while family farmers only own 6.86 % (the national average is 33.92 %). Agrarian inequalities only exacerbate  tensions relating to the ethnic origins of diff erent groups of farmers. While the symbolic component of agribusiness is praised by political and economic leaders (most of whom have German and Italian heri-tage) as the belated redemption of the region from a past of isolation and backwardness maintained by a (non-white) regional population, there is evidence of racism, escalating hostilities, and harassment of subsistence farmers and landless groups seeking to legalize their land. MT was the state with the second highest level of rural violence in Brazil in 2014 (a trend that has persisted for many years), with 30 serious incidents involv-ing 1618 families, as well as six cases of water-related confl icts (CPT  2015 ).

IorisCláudia (Dec. 2014), it was affi  rmed that ‘we had a long struggle to avoid having our piece of land in this region dominated by agribusiness. We only live because of are stubborn, we occupy space. Agribusiness has a lot of support [ apoio ], but we only have constraints [“ arroio ”]’.  Cases of violence against family farmers are extremely alarming, but perhaps it is even more troubling to observe the return and escalation of systematic hostility towards indigenous groups (tragically, after fi ve centuries of systematic abuse and genocide). Widespread aggression is nonetheless openly justifi ed by the organizations that represent agribusi-ness farmers, as can be seen in numerous articles on the webpage of the soybean association Aprosoja-MT that refer to what is described as the ‘Indian Problem’. Land disputes involving indigenous groups were, in eff ect, identifi ed in some of our interviews with agribusiness leaders as their main problem and the key challenge aff ecting the sector due to the demands of several displaced tribes. At the same time, indigenous groups are well connected and aware of the value of soybean lands and are increasingly seeking to obtain a share of this value by either renting out or cultivating the land themselves.  Another phenomenon that vividly connects violence across centuries and geographies is the re-emergence of slavery in the countryside, where those displaced by the advance of modern agriculture are then retained to work without pay, using various means of coercion, such as pending debts or isolation (Figueira and Prado  2011 ). In 2013, the Ministry of Labour and Employment listed 61 properties in MT in the national database of slavery cases, including soybean farms, cattle ranches, and timber compa-nies (Diário de Cuiabá  2013 ). Slavery-like situations were found on the properties of even the most powerful and well-connected farmers, such as the family of the former state governor Blairo Maggi. Th e power and infl u-ence of such farmers raises serious obstacles to their prosecution (Reporter Brasil  2010 ). Th e existence of slavery in the ultra-modern agriculture of MT brings back memories of some spectral elements of capitalism, which never actually disappeared: the invisible becomes visible again (Derrida  1994 ).  On the other hand, the agribusiness sector has demonstrated a great ability to dilute and deny its responsibility for mounting negative socio- ecological impacts. While neoliberalized agriculture maximizes the use of fossil fuels, biotechnology, and agrochemicals, it also necessarily has to 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 239respond to environmental concerns and customer expectations (Otero  2012 ). In MT, the response has come in the form of a belated fondness for claims of sustainability and ecological modernization. Th e associa-tion of soybean producers published a bilingual booklet,  On the Road to Sustainability , which emphasizes the environmental consciousness of soybean producers, citing in particular the concentration of production in savannah areas (rather than in the Amazon forest) and the adoption of integrated technologies. According to the association, ‘there is a strong correlation between soybean yield and macro socio-environmental indi-cators, such as the Human Development Index (HDI). Th e ten cities with the largest soybean production have rates above the state and the country averages’ (Aprosoja-MT  n.d. : 11). In our interviews, the asso-ciation’s spokespersons make frequent reference to the ‘green passport’ of agribusiness in MT, basically because of the adoption of no-tillage technology and gains of productivity (supposedly preventing the open-ing of new production areas). In this way, agribusiness in MT has tried to reinvent itself as an environmentally sensitive sector, deeply concerned about the impact of its activity on the well-being of wider society.  However, although agribusiness farmers are proud to say that MT still maintains large areas of original vegetation, this tends to be because these areas are remote and would not be cost-eff ective locations for soybean production. Every year, this frontier of cost-eff ectiveness moves, with technological improvements and increases in land prices in the consoli-dated zones, leading to the constant opening of new production areas. Th e  situation embodies the Jevons paradox (Ceddia et al.  2013 ), where the use of a resource becomes increasingly effi  cient, but increasing demand for the same resource leads to a greater rate of consumption: higher agri-cultural productivity in MT has increased, rather than decreased, rural land use. Despite constant increases in the use of resources—land, water, and energy in particular—concepts like sustainability and fl exible regula-tion have been used by sector representatives to confer an image of righ-teousness on modern, intensive agriculture practices:  Our agriculture cannot be considered anything but sustainable. Sustainability is profi table: we don’t do things to gain foreign recognition, but only because of the economic results. (…) We do it despite lots of production diffi  culties 240 A.A.R. Ioris[that we face]: too much regulation, the [legal] requirement to set aside part of our property uncultivated [between 20 %–50 %, depending on the loca-tion]…But this again demonstrates that we are sustainable. (Interview, MT soybean association director, June 2013)  Th e surprising ‘environmental turn’ of the agribusiness sector has been accompanied by a search for national and, crucially, international recog-nition. In a talk at a workshop in the Wilson Center in Washington DC on 4 December 2008, the then state governor Blairo Maggi (2003–2010) [senator since 2011] provided a textbook defence of MT’s ecological prerogatives. Leader of a family business established by his father a few decades earlier, when the clan moved from the south of Brazil to MT, Maggi is the owner of one of the largest soybean companies in the world (responsible for around 5 % of the total amount of soybean produced in the country, and increasingly involved in large public infrastructure, trans-national trade, and fi nancial services). According to various interviews in May 2014, 5  during his time as governor, Maggi repeatedly claimed to be running the state administration as a business enterprise, and played a key role in the consolidation of agribusiness (including new legislation instituting the transfer of public funds to support Aprosoja-MT, mak-ing it the strongest and most active representation of soybean  producers in the country). At the Wilson Center, Maggi used his training as an agronomist to explain how technology helps to protect the environment. Although Maggi was awarded the sarcastic ‘Golden Chainsaw’ trophy by Greenpeace in 2005, as the Brazilian who contributed most to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, in Washington, the governor talked about the risks of anthropogenic climate change and the need to act ‘not because of the environmentalists, but because the scientists are now tell-ing us the urgency and relevance of such issues’.  Th e most evocative part of Maggi’s intervention during the workshop was his passionate defence of market-friendly solutions, especially the role of payment for ecosystem services, carbons markets, and the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) scheme 5   In 2014, Senator Blairo Maggi was also under criminal investigation by the federal police due to suspicions of using illegal sources to fund his senate election campaign in 2010 Maggi succeded Ms Abreu in May 2016 as the new Secretary of State of Agriculture. 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 241advanced by the United Nations. ‘We must fi nd a way to ensure that forests are more valuable standing than destroyed,’ said Maggi (Wilson Center  2009 : 2). Governor Maggi stressed the urgency of creating such a mechanism. ‘Global warming has been scientifi cally proven; we no lon-ger have the right to ignore climate change.’ Th e appropriation of envi-ronmental claims to serve business and political interests is also evident in Maggi’s trajectory as a congressman. After becoming a senator in 2010, Maggi was one of the main advocates for the reform of the Forest Code, which was eventually approved in 2012 after a lengthy controversy and with detailed regulation introduced in 2014. Th e aim of the reform was to fl exibilize the previous requirement to maintain a certain percentage of the natural vegetation on rural land. Th e reform means that it is now possible to compensate for deforestation on a rural property with another forested area elsewhere, which in practice ‘creates’ more cropland. Th is preference for self-regulation and market-based approaches, instead of stricter forms of environmental control, refl ects the pressures and oppor-tunities created by the mechanisms of ecological modernization in a con-text of global environmental awareness (Jansen and Vellema  2004 ).  Th e trend towards commodifi cation of rural activities and the double, interconnected exploitation of labour and nature are specifi c elements of the ‘necessity’ of present-day neoliberal capitalism. Necessity, in the Hegelian tradition, is the central property of the process of historical change, not as deterministic cause but part of the contingent emergence of things in their present form (Mann  2008 ). In the specifi c case of the MT experience, it seems that agro-neoliberalism necessitates synergies with other associated public policies based on new rounds of commodifi -cation, as in the case of ecological modernization approaches. Moreover, these are all examples of highly contested bio-politics spreading through agri-food networks and revealing the questionable prospects of market- centred alternatives and the limited nature of agribusiness sustainability (Marsden  2004 ). Th e rationalization of socio-environmental regulation according to specifi c economic interests and following the logic of agro- neoliberal polices also demonstrates the infl uence of power hegemonies aff ecting the confi guration and the responses of the state apparatus (Ioris  2014 ). Th e dialectics between the contingent and the necessary evolu-tion of agribusiness has helpful explanatory capacity here in the sense 242 A.A.R. Ioristhat it makes evident, beyond the more abstract explanation in terms of accumulation regimes, both the local specifi cities of intensive farming and its insertion into the cross-scale features of contemporary capital-ist agriculture refl ected and acted upon by the state. It reveals the ‘agro’ being transformed and reshaped according to the business rationality of commodifi cation, privatization, and maximum exploitation needed to sustain profi tability. Or, as denounced in a timely fashion by Oliveira ( 2003 ), the unfolding of novel socio-economic relations dynamically reproduces and invigorates outdated features from previous stages of the long trajectory of capitalism.      Conclusions: The Frontiers and Prospects of Neoliberalized Agribusiness  Th e previous pages discussed how the apparent economic and techno-logical success of the agribusiness sector in Brazil is also characterized by organized attempts to infl uence policymaking and conceal risks and impacts associated with a narrow production basis (i.e. exports increas-ingly concentrated on a small range of commodities, soybean in par-ticular). Th e Brazilian experience illustrates how agro-neoliberalism fl ourishes in a context of market-centred solutions and regulatory fl ex-ibility, but also that it demands novel forms of government support and relies on some of the oldest political traditions (e.g. aggressive manipula-tion of party politics, lack of transparency, deceitful claims of progress, and elements of racism). Th e advance of neoliberalized agribusiness has been the embodiment of the most technologically advanced and socio- ecologically regressive elements of a national economy on the periph-ery of globalized capitalism. Th e image of success is daily reaffi  rmed by sector representatives and endorsed by the national government in its eff ort to gain political support and maintain the export revenues gener-ated by agribusiness. Th e result is a nuanced and highly contested situ-ation that connects, often in unexpected ways, diff erent scales, sectors, and public policies. Th e various techno-economic innovations adopted by agribusiness players—including land and gene grabs, biotechnology and genetically modifi ed organisms (GMOs), dispossession of common 9 Frontiers of Agricultural Development and Environmental... 243land, fi nancialization, and administration of production by TNCs (trans-national corporations)—are all strategies that emerge from business and political interactions, which combine old and new features of the capital-ist economy. All this requires appropriate interpretative approaches able to unpack the idiosyncratic combination of incremental innovations in a context of hegemonic market globalization.  It is in agribusiness frontier areas, as in the case of MT, that neoliberal-ized agribusiness makes evident its most profound abilities, contradic-tions, and, ultimately, failures. Agribusiness is especially successful at the agriculture frontier because it is in itself an economic, ecological, and ethical frontier, in which interpersonal and intersectoral relations have a particular confi guration that allows authorities to deceive the popula-tion and impose undemocratic measures due to the primacy of produc-tion and the emphasis on rapid accumulation. It constitutes a favourable arena for rehearsing the fl exible mechanisms of accumulation and regula-tion required by neoliberal activities, while this frontier is shaped by mar-ket freedom, low moral standards, and associated forms of violence. Th e advance of agribusiness depends on the perpetual re-enactment of dreams (merged with novel forms of violence and frustration) related to the prom-ises of rapid wealth accumulation and social prestige. High expectations are needed to motivate the conquest and transformation of territory to make way for crop production. Th e peculiar dialectics taking place at the frontier, including processes of transnationalization,  displacement, and mystifi cation, are fi rmly mediated by structures inherited from the past, which create a complex pattern, spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Th e curious attacks on the apparatus of the state by agribusiness farm-ers—who have been major benefi ciaries of state investments and regional development policies—are emblematic examples of an inbuilt opportun-ism and peculiar production rationality located between the demands of the state and those of transnational corporations.  Th e agribusiness frontier in MT has provided opportunities for both the renovation of capitalist institutions (i.e. globalized transactions, maximized use of territorial resources, novel forms of political legitimiza-tion) and the reintroduction or reinforcement of old practices of the pre- industrial or early industrial phase of capitalism (i.e. brutal appropriation of the commons, commodifi cation of features previously beyond market 244 A.A.R. Ioristransactions, and even cases of twenty-fi rst-century slavery). At the fron-tier, the politico-economic institutions of neoliberalism can expand and take on, to some extent, a life of their own. Similar to the expansion to the west of the USA more than a century ago, ethical and legal safeguards tend to be suspended or overlooked due to the alleged need to occupy the ‘wild’ territory and then sustain the production of the most marketable and profi table goods. Th e consolidation of agribusiness in MT involved constant innovation and new players, who retained old, vicious practices that have never disappeared. Martins ( 2009 ) argues that this is a human frontier shaped by the false dichotomy between civilization and non- civilization, because it constitutes a degraded but comprehensive real-ity, one of the most brutal chapters of economic development in Brazil, where the main protagonists are the victims (Indians and subsistence farmers). Th e frontier in MT is in this case a real ‘territory of death’ and the place where the most inhuman archaisms are reborn; it is ‘exactly the opposite of what the imagined idea of a “frontier” proclaims’ (Martins  2009 : 13–14). In that sense, the totality of the frontier, as a space fraught with politico-economic and socio-ecological tensions, must be seen as a peculiar locus of intolerance, ambition, and, all too often, tragedy.
