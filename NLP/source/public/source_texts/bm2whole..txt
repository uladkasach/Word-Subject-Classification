Preface

This book evolved from a course in molecular biology which I have been
teaching  primarily  to  graduate  students  for  the  past  twenty  years.
Because the subject is now mature, it is possible to present the material
by covering the  principles and encouraging students to learn how to
apply them. Such an approach is particularly efficient as the subject of
molecular  genetics  now  is  far  too  advanced,  large,  and  complex  for
much  value  to  come  from  attempting  to  cover  the  material  in  an
encyclopedia-like  fashion  or  teaching  the  definitions  of  the  relevant
words in a dictionary-like approach. Only the core of molecular genetics
can be covered by the present approach. Most of the remainder of the
vast subject however, is a logical extension of the ideas and principles
presented  here.  One  consequence  of  the  principles  and  analysis  ap-
proach taken here is that the material is not easy. Thinking and learning
to reason from the fundamentals require serious effort, but ultimately,
are more efficient and more rewarding than mere memorization.

An auxiliary objective of this presentation is to help students develop
an  appreciation  for  elegant  and  beautiful  experiments.  A  substantial
number  of  such  experiments are  explained in  the  text, and  the  cited
papers contain many more.

The book contains three types of information. The main part of each
chapter is the text. Following each chapter are references and problems.
References are arranged by topic, and one topic is “Suggested Read-
ings”. The additional references cited permit a student or researcher to
find many of the fundamental papers on a topic. Some of these are on
topics not directly covered in the text. Because solving problems helps
focus one’s attention and stimulates understanding, many thought-pro-
voking problems or paradoxes are provided. Some of these require use
of material in addition to the text. Solutions are provided to about half
of the problems.

vi  Preface

Although the ideal preparation for taking the course and using the
book would be the completion of preliminary courses in biochemistry,
molecular biology, cell biology, and physical chemistry, few students
have  such  a  background.  Most  commonly,  only  one  or  two  of  the
above-mentioned courses have been taken, with some students coming
from  a  more  physical  or  chemical  background,  and  other  students
coming from a more biological background.

My course consists of two lectures and one discussion session per
week,  with  most  chapters being  covered  in  one  lecture. The  lectures
often  summarize  material  of  a  chapter  and  then  discuss  in  depth  a
recent paper that extends the material of the chapter. Additional read-
ings of original research papers are an important part of the course for
graduate  students,  and  typically  such  two  papers  are  assigned  per
lecture.  Normally,  two  problems  from  the  ends  of  the  chapters  are
assigned per lecture. 

Many of the ideas presented in the book have been sharpened by my
frequent discussions with Pieter Wensink, and I thank him for this. I
thank my editors, James Funston for guidance on the first edition and
Yale  Altman  and  Richard  O’Grady  for  ensuring  the  viability  of  the
second edition. I also thank members of my laboratory and the following
who  read  and  commented  on  portions  of  the  manuscript:  Karen
Beemon, Howard Berg, Don Brown, Victor Corces, Jeff Corden, David
Draper, Mike Edidin, Bert Ely, Richard Gourse, Ed Hedgecock, Roger
Hendrix,  Jay  Hirsh,  Andy  Hoyt,  Amar  Klar,  Ed  Lattman,  Roger
McMacken, Howard Nash, and Peter Privalov.

An Overview of Cell
Structure and Function

1

In this book we will be concerned with the basics of the macromolecular
interactions  that  affect  cellular  processes.  The  basic  tools  for  such
studies are genetics, chemistry, and physics.  For the most part, we will
be concerned with understanding processes that occur within cells, such
as DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and regulation of gene activity. The
initial studies of these processes utilize whole cells. These normally are
followed by deeper biochemical and biophysical studies of individual
components. Before beginning the main topics we should take time for
an overview of cell structure and function. At the same time we should
develop our intuitions about the time and distance scales relevant to the
molecules and cells we will study.

Many of the experiments discussed in this book were done with the
bacterium Escherichia coli, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the
fruit  fly  Drosophila  melanogaster.  Each  of  these  organisms  possesses
unique characteristics making it particularly suitable for study. In fact,
most of the research in molecular biology has been confined to these
three organisms. The earliest and most extensive work has been done
with Escherichia coli. The growth of this oranism is rapid and inexpen-
sive,  and  many  of  the  most  fundamental  problems  in  biology  are
displayed  by systems  utilized  by  this bacterium.  These problems are
therefore most efficiently studied there. The eukaryotic organisms are
necessary for study of phenomena not observed in bacteria, but parallel
studies on other bacteria and higher cells have revealed that the basic
principles of cell operation are the same for all cell types.

2  An Overview of Cell Structure and Function

Cell’s Need for Immense Amounts of Information

Cells face enormous problems in growing. We can develop some idea of
the situation by considering a totally self-sufficient toolmaking shop. If
we provide the shop with coal for energy and crude ores, analogous to
a cell’s nutrient medium, then a very large collection of machines and
tools is necessary merely to manufacture each of the parts present in
the shop. Still greater complexity would be added if we required that
the shop be totally self-regulating and that each machine be self-assem-
bling. Cells face and solve these types of problems. In addition, each of
the chemical reactions necessary for growth of cells is carried out in an
aqueous  environment  at  near  neutral  pH.  These  are  conditions  that
would cripple ordinary chemists.

By the tool shop analogy, we expect cells to utilize large numbers of
“parts,” and, also by analogy to factories, we expect each of these parts
to be generated by a specialized machine devoted to production of just
one type  of part. Indeed, biochemists’ studies of metabolic pathways
have revealed that an E. coli cell contains about 1,000 types of parts, or
small molecules, and that each is generated by a specialized machine,
an enzyme. The information required to specify the structure of even
one machine is immense, a fact made apparent by trying to describe an
object without pictures and drawings. Thus, it is reasonable, and indeed
it has been found that cells function with truly immense amounts of
information.

DNA is the cell’s library in which information is stored in its sequence
of  nucleotides.  Evolution  has  built  into  this  library  the  information
necessary for cells’ growth and division. Because of the great value of
the DNA library, it is natural that it be carefully protected and preserved.
Except  for  some  of  the  simplest  viruses,  cells  keep  duplicates  of  the
information by using a pair of self-complementary DNA strands. Each
strand contains a complete copy of the information, and chemical or
physical damage to one strand is recognized by special enzymes and is
repaired  by  making  use  of  information  contained  on  the  opposite
strand. More complex cells further preserve their information by pos-
sessing duplicate DNA duplexes.

Much of the recent activity in molecular biology can be understood
in  terms  of  the  cell’s  library.  This  library  contains  the  information
necessary to construct the different cellular machines. Clearly, such a
library contains far too much information for the cell to use at any one
time. Therefore mechanisms have developed to recognize the need for
particular portions, “books,” of the information and read this out of the
library  in  the  form  of  usable  copies.  In  cellular  terms,  this  is  the
regulation of gene activity.

Rudiments of Prokaryotic Cell Structure

A typical prokaryote, E. coli, is a rod capped with hemispheres (Fig. 1.1).
It is 1–3 µ (10-4 cm = 1 µ = 104 Å) long and 0.75 µ in diameter. Such a

cell contains about 2 × 10-13 g of protein, 2 × 10-14 g of RNA that is mostly
ribosomal RNA, and 6 × 10-15 g of DNA.

The cell envelope consists of three parts, an inner and outer mem-
brane  and  an  intervening  peptidoglycan  layer  (Fig.  1.2).  The  outer
surface of the outer membrane is largely lipopolysaccharides. These are
attached to lipids in the outer half of the outer membrane. The polysac-
charides  protect  the  outer  membrane  from  detergent-like  molecules

consists of matrix proteins that form pores small enough to exclude the
detergent-like bile salts, but large enough to permit passage of small
molecules and phospholipids.

Figure 1.3  Structure  of  the  cell  wall  showing  the  alternating  N-acetylglu-
cosamine N-acetylmuramic acid units. Each N-acetylmuramic acid possesses
a peptide, but only a few are crosslinked in E. coli.

The  major  shape-determining  factor  of  cells  is  the  peptidoglycan
layer or cell wall (Fig. 1.3). It lies beneath the outer membrane and is a
single molecule containing many polysaccharide chains crosslinked by
short peptides (Fig. 1.4). The outer membrane is attached to the pepti-
doglycan layer by about 106 lipoprotein molecules. The protein end of
each of these is covalently attached to the diaminopimelic acid in the
peptidoglycan. The lipid end is buried in the outer membrane. 

The  innermost  of  the  three  cell  envelope  layers  is  the  inner  or
cytoplasmic  membrane.  It  consists  of  many  proteins  embedded  in  a
phospholipid bilayer. The space between the inner membrane and the
outer membrane that contains the peptidoglycan layer is known as the
periplasmic space. The cell wall and membranes contain about 20% of
the cellular protein. After cell disruption by sonicating or grinding, most
of this protein is still contained in fragments of wall and membrane and
can be easily pelleted by low-speed centrifugation.

The cytoplasm within the inner membrane is a protein solution at
about  200  mg/ml,  about  20  times  more  concentrated  than  the  usual
cell-free extracts used in the laboratory. Some proteins in the cytoplasm
may constitute as little as 0.0001% by weight of the total cellular protein
whereas  others  may  be  found  at  levels  as  high  as  5%.  In  terms  of
concentrations, this is from 10-8 M to  2 × 10-4 M, and in a bacterial cell
this  is  from  10  to  200,000  molecules  per  cell.  The  concentrations  of
many of  the  proteins vary  with growth conditions, and a  current re-
search area is the study of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the
variations.

The majority of the more than 2,000 different types of proteins found
within a bacterial cell are located in the cytoplasm. One question yet to

be answered about these proteins is how they manage to exist in the cell
without adhering to each other and forming aggregates since polypep-
tides  can  easily  bind  to  each  other.  Frequently  when  a  bacterium  is
engineered  for  the  over-synthesis  of  a  foreign  protein,  amorphous
precipitates called inclusion bodies form in the cytoplasm. Sometimes
these result from delayed folding of the new protein, and occasionally
they are the result of chance coprecipitation of a bacterial protein and
the  newly  introduced  protein.  Similarly,  one  might  also  expect  an
occasional mutation to inactivate simultaneously two apparently unre-
lated proteins by the coprecipitation of the mutated protein and some
other  protein  into  an  inactive  aggregate,  and  occasionally  this  does
occur.

The cell’s DNA and about 10,000 ribosomes also reside in the cyto-
plasm. The ribosomes consist of about one-third protein and two-thirds
RNA and are roughly spherical with a diameter of about 200 Å. The DNA
in the cytoplasm is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane as it is in
the cells of higher organisms, but nonetheless it is usually confined to
a portion of the cellular interior. In electron micrographs of cells, the
highly compacted DNA can be seen as a stringy mass occupying about
one tenth of the interior volume, and the ribosomes appear as granules
uniformly scattered through the cytoplasm.

6  An Overview of Cell Structure and Function

Rudiments of Eukaryotic Cell Structure

A typical eukaryotic cell is 10 µ in diameter, making its volume about
1,000 times that of a bacterial cell. Like bacteria, eukaryotic cells contain
cell membranes, cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, and ribosomes, albeit of
somewhat different structure from the corresponding prokaryotic ele-
ments  (Fig.  1.5).  Eukaryotic  cells,  however,  possess  many  structural
features that even more clearly distinguish them from prokaryotic cells.
Within the eukaryotic cytoplasm are a number of structural proteins
that form networks. Microtubules, actin, intermediate filaments, and
thin  filaments  form  four  main  categories  of  fibers  found  within  eu-
karyotic cells. Fibers within the cell provide a rigid structural skeleton,
participate in vesicle and chromosome movement, and participate in
changing the cell shape so that it can move.  They also bind the majority
of the ribosomes.

The DNA of eukaryotic cells does not freely mix with the cytoplasm,
but is confined within a nuclear membrane. Normally only small pro-
teins of molecular weight less than  20 to 40,000 can  freely enter  the
nucleus through the nuclear membrane. Larger proteins and nuclear
RNAs enter the nucleus through special nuclear pores. These are large
structures that actively transport proteins or RNAs into or out of the
nucleus. In each cell cycle, the nuclear membrane dissociates, and then
later reaggregates. The DNA itself is tightly complexed with a class of
proteins called histones, whose main function appears to be to help DNA
retain  a  condensed  state.  When  the  cell  divides,  a  special  apparatus
called the spindle, and consisting in part of microtubules, is necessary
to pull the chromosomes into the daughter cells.

Eukaryotic  cells  also  contain  specialized  organelles  such  as  mito-
chondria,  which  perform  oxidative  phosphorylation  to  generate  the
cell’s needed chemical energy. In many respects mitochondria resemble
bacteria and, in fact, appear to have evolved from bacteria. They contain
DNA, usually in the form of a circular chromosome like that of E. coli

and ribosomes that often more closely resemble those found in bacteria
than  the  ribosomes  located  in  the  cytoplasm  of  the  eukaryotic  cell.
Chloroplasts  carry out photosynthesis in plant cells, and are another
type of specialized organelle found within some eukaryotic cells. Like
mitochondria, chloroplasts also contain DNA and ribosomes different
from the analogous structures located elsewhere in the cell. 

Most eukaryotic cells also contain internal membranes. The nucleus
is  surrounded by two membranes. The endoplasmic reticulum is an-
other  membrane  found  in  eukaryotic  cells.  It  is  contiguous  with  the
outer nuclear membrane but extends throughout the cytoplasm in many
types  of  cells  and  is  involved  with  the  synthesis  and  transport  of
membrane proteins. The Golgi apparatus is another structure contain-
ing membranes. It is involved with modifying proteins for their trans-
port to other cellular organelles or for export out of the cell.

Packing DNA into Cells

The DNA of the E. coli chromosome has a molecular weight of about 2
×  109  and  thus  is  about  3  ×  106  base  pairs  long.  Since  the  distance
between base pairs in DNA is about 3.4 Å, the length of the chromosome
is 107 Å or 0.1 cm. This is very long compared to the 104 Å length of a
bacterial cell, and the DNA must therefore wind back and forth many
times within the cell. Observation by light microscopy of living bacterial
cells and by electron microscopy of fixed and sectioned cells show, that
often the DNA is confined to a portion of the interior of the cell with
dimensions less than 0.25 µ.

To  gain  some  idea  of  the  relevant  dimensions,  let  us  estimate  the
number  of times  that  the  DNA  of a  bacterium winds back and forth
within a volume we shall approximate as a cube 0.25 µ on a side. This
will provide an idea of the average distance separating the DNA duplexes
and will also give some idea of the proportion of the DNA that lies on

ber of times the E. coli chromosome

the surface of the chromosomal mass. The number of times, N, that the
DNA must wind back and forth will then be related to the length of the
DNA and the volume in which it is contained. If we approximate the
path of the DNA  as consisting of n layers, each layer consisting of n
segments of length 0.25 µ (Fig. 1.6), the total number of segments is n2.
Therefore, 2,500n2 Å = 107 Å and n = 60. The spacing between adjacent
segments of the DNA is 2,500 Å/60 = 40 Å.

The close spacing between DNA duplexes raises the interesting prob-
lem of accessibility of the DNA. RNA polymerase has a diameter of about
100 Å and it may not fit between the duplexes. Therefore, quite possibly
only DNA on the surface of the nuclear mass is accessible for transcrip-
tion.  On  the  other  hand,  transcription  of  the  lactose  and  arabinose
operons  can  be  induced  within  as  short  a  time  as  two  seconds after
adding inducers. Consequently either the nuclear mass is in such rapid
motion that any portion of the DNA finds its way to the surface at least
once  every  several  seconds,  or  the  RNA  polymerase  molecules  do
penetrate  to  the  interior  of  the  nuclear  mass  and  are  able  to  begin
transcription  of  any  gene  at  any  time.  Possibly,  start  points  of  the
arabinose and lactose operons always reside on the surface of the DNA.
Compaction  of  the  DNA  generates  even  greater  problems  in  eu-
karyotic cells. Not only do they contain up to 1,000 times the amount of
the DNA found in bacteria, but the presence of the histones on the DNA
appears to hinder access of RNA polymerase and other enzymes to the
DNA. In part, this problem is solved by regulatory proteins binding to
regulatory  regions  before  nucleosomes  can  form  in  these  positions.
Apparently,  upon  activation  of  a  gene  additional  regulatory  proteins
bind, displacing more histones, and transcription begins. The DNA of
many eukaryotic cells is specially contracted before cell division, and at
this time it actually does become inaccessible to RNA polymerase. At all
times, however, accessibility of the DNA to RNA polymerase must be
hindered.

Moving Molecules into or out of Cells

Small-molecule metabolic intermediates must not leak out of cells into
the  medium.  Therefore,  an  impermeable  membrane  surrounds  the
cytoplasm. To solve the problem of moving essential small molecules
like sugars and ions into the cell, special transporter protein molecules
are inserted into the membranes. These and auxiliary proteins in the
cytoplasm must possess selectivity for the small-molecules being trans-
ported. If the small-molecules are being concentrated in the cell and not
just  passively  crossing  the  membrane,  then  the  proteins  must  also
couple the consumption of metabolic energy from the cell to the active
transport.

The  amount  of  work  consumed  in  transporting  a  molecule  into  a
volume against a concentration gradient may be obtained by consider-
ing the simple reaction where Ao is the concentration of the molecule
outside the cell and Ai is the concentration inside the cell:

This reaction can be described by an equilibrium constant

The equilibrium constant Keq, is related to the free energy of the reaction

where  R  is  about  2  cal/deg.mole  and  T  is  300°  K  (about  25°  C),  the
temperature of many biological reactions. Suppose the energy of hy-
drolysis of ATP to ADP is coupled to this reaction with a 50% efficiency.
Then about 3,500 of the total of 7,000 calories available per mole of ATP
hydrolyzed  under  physiological  conditions  will  be  available  to  the
transport system. Consequently, the equilibrium constant will be 

Keq  =  e−∆G

One interesting result of this consideration is that the work required
to transport a molecule is independent of the absolute concentrations;
it depends only on the ratio of the inside and outside concentrations.
The transport systems of cells must recognize the type of molecule to
be  transported,  since  not  all  types  are  transported,  and  convey  the
molecule either to the inside or to the outside of the cell. Further, if the
molecule is being concentrated within the cell, the system must tap an
energy source for the process. Owing to the complexities of this process,
it is not surprising that the details of active transport systems are far
from being fully understood.

Four  basic  types  of  small-molecule  transport  systems  have  been
discovered. The first of these is facilitated diffusion. Here the molecule

must get into or out of the cell on its own, but special doors are opened
for it. That is, specific carriers exist that bind to the molecule and shuttle
it through the membrane. Glycerol enters most types of bacteria by this
mechanism.  Once  within  the  cell  the  glycerol  is  phosphorylated  and
cannot diffuse back out through the membrane, nor can it exit by using
the glycerol carrier protein that carried the glycerol into the cell.

A second method of concentrating molecules within cells is similar
to the facilitated diffusion and phosphorylation of glycerol. The phos-
photransferase system actively rather than passively carries a number
of types of sugars across the cell membrane and, in the process, phos-
phorylates them (Fig. 1.7). The actual energy for the transport comes
from phosphoenolpyruvate. The phosphate group and part of the chemi-
cal energy contained in the phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred down a
series of proteins, two of which are used by all the sugars transported
by this system and two of which are specific for the particular sugar
being transported. The final protein is located in the membrane and is
directly responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of the trans-
ported sugar.

Protons are expelled from E. coli during the flow of reducing power
from NADH to oxygen.  The resulting concentration difference in H+
ions  between the  interior  and  exterior of the  cell generates  a  proton
motive force or membrane potential that can then be coupled to ATP
synthesis or to the transport of molecules across the membrane. Active
transport  systems  using  this  energy  source  are  called  chemiosmotic
systems. In the process of permitting a proton to flow back into the cell,
another  small  molecule  can  be  carried  into  the  cell,  which  is  called
symport, or carried out of the cell, which is called antiport (Fig. 1.8).

In many eukaryotic cells, a membrane potential is generated by the
sodium-potassium  pump.  From  the  energy  of  hydrolysis  of  one  ATP
molecule, 3 Na+ ions are transported outside the cell and 2 K+ ions are
transported inside. The resulting gradient in sodium ions can then be
coupled to the transport of other molecules or used to transmit signals
along a membrane.

Study  of  all  transport  systems  has  been  difficult  because  of  the
necessity of working with membranes, but the chemiosmotic system has
been particularly hard due to the difficulty of manipulating membrane
potentials.  Fortunately  the  existence  of  bacterial  mutants  blocked  at

from permitting protons to flow back into the cell.

various steps of the transport process has permitted partial dissection
of the system. We are, however, very far from completely understanding
the actual mechanisms involved in chemiosmotic systems.

The  binding  protein  systems  represent  another  type  of  transport
through  membranes.  These  systems  utilize  proteins  located  in  the
periplasmic space that specifically bind sugars, amino acids, and ions.
Apparently, these periplasmic binding proteins transfer their substrates
to specific carrier molecules located in the cell membrane. The energy
source for these systems is ATP or a closely related metabolite.

Transporting large molecules through the cell wall and membranes
poses additional problems. Eukaryotic cells can move larger molecules
through  the  membrane  by  exocytosis  and  endocytosis  processes  in
which the membrane encompasses the molecule or molecules. In the
case  of  endocytosis,  the  molecule  can  enter  the  cell,  but  it  is  still
separated from the cytoplasm by the membrane. This membrane must
be removed in order for the membrane-enclosed packet of material to
be  released  into  the  cytoplasm.  By  an  analogous  process,  exocytosis
releases membrane-enclosed packets to the cell exterior.

Releasing phage from bacteria also poses difficult problems. Some
types of filamentous phage  slip  through  the  membrane  like a snake.
They  are encapsidated  as  they exit  the  membrane by  phage proteins
located in the membrane. Other types of phage must digest the cell wall
to make holes large enough to exit. These phage lyse their hosts in the
process of being released.

An illuminating example of endocytosis is the uptake of  low density
lipoprotein, a 200 Å diameter protein complex that carries about 1,500
molecules of cholesterol into cells. Pits coated with a receptor of the low
density lipoprotein form in the membrane. The shape of these pits is
guided  by  triskelions,  an  interesting  structural  protein  consisting  of
three molecules of clathrin. After receptors have been in a pit for about

ten minutes, the pit pinches off and diffuses through the cytoplasm (Fig.
1.9). Upon reaching the lysosome, the clatherin cage of triskelions is
disassembled, cholesterol is released, and the receptors recycle.

Diffusion within the Small Volume of a Cell

Within  several  minutes  of  adding  a  specific  inducer  to  bacteria  or
eukaryotic  cells,  newly  synthesized  active  enzymes  can  be  detected.
These are the result of the synthesis of the appropriate messenger RNA,
its translation into protein, and the folding of the protein to an active
conformation. Quite obviously,  processes are happening very rapidly
within a cell for this entire sequence to be completed in several minutes.
We will see that our image of synthetic processes in the cellular interior
should be that of an assembly line running hundreds of times faster than
normal, and our image for the random motion of molecules from one
point to another can be that of a washing machine similarly running
very rapidly.

The random motion of molecules within cells can be estimated from
basic  physical  chemical principles.  We will develop such an analysis

2 = 6Dt (Fig.
molecule with diffusion constant D will diffuse in time t is R
1.10). The diffusion constants of many molecules have been measured
and are available in tables. For our purposes, we can estimate a value
for a diffusion constant. The diffusion constant is D = KT⁄f , where K is
the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 × 10-16 ergs/degree, T is temperature in
degrees  Kelvin,  and  f  is  the  frictional  force.  For  spherical  bodies,
f = 6πηr , where r is the radius in centimeters and η is the viscosity of
the medium in units of poise.

The viscosity of water is 10-2 poise. Although the macroviscosity of
the cell’s interior could be much greater, as suggested by the extremely
high viscosity of gently lysed cells, the viscosity of the cell’s interior with

respect to motion of molecules the size of proteins or smaller is more
likely  to  be  similar  to  that  of  water.  This  is  reasonable,  for  small
molecules can go around obstacles such as long strands of DNA, but
large molecules would have to displace a huge tangle of DNA strands.
A demonstration of this effect is the finding that small molecules such
as  amino  acids  readily  diffuse  through  the  agar  used  for  growing
bacterial colonies, but objects as large as viruses are immobile in the
agar, yet diffuse normally in solution.

Since D = KT⁄6πηr, then D = 4.4 × 10-7 for a large spherical protein of
radius 50 Å diffusing in water, and the diffusion constant for such a
__
protein  within  a  cell  is  not  greatly  different.  Therefore
2 = 6 × 4.4 × 10−7t,  and  the  average  time  required  for  such  protein
R
molecules to diffuse the length of a 1 µ bacterial cell is 1/250 second and
to  diffuse  the  length  of  a  20  µ  eukaryotic  cell  is  about  2  seconds.
Analogous  reasoning  with  respect  to  rotation  shows  that  a  protein
rotates about 1/8 radian (about 7°) in the time it diffuses a distance equal
to its radius.

Exponentially Growing Populations

Reproducibility from one day to the next and between different labora-
tories is necessary before meaningful measurements can be made on
growing cells. Populations of cells that are not overcrowded or limited
by oxygen, nutrients, or ions grow freely and can be easily reproduced.
Such freely growing populations are almost universally used in molecu-
lar biology, and several of their properties are important. The rate of
increase  in  the  number  of  cells  in  a  freely  growing  population  is
proportional to the number of cells present, that is, 

dN

In these expressions µ is termed the exponential growth rate of the cells.
The following properties of the exponential function are frequently
useful when manipulating data or expressions involving growth of cells.

this book we will use µ as the exponential growth rate. The time required
for cells to double in number, Td, is easier to measure experimentally as
well as to think about than the exponential growth rate. Therefore we
often need to interconvert the two rates Td and µ. Note that the number
of cells or some quantity related to the number of cells in freely growing

Composition Change in Growing Cells  15

populations can be written as Q(t) = 2t/Td, and since 2 = eln2, Q(t) can
also be written  as  Q(t) =  e(ln2/Td)t, thereby  showing  that  the  relation
between Td and µ is µ = ln2/Td.

Composition Change in Growing Cells

In many experiments it is necessary to consider the time course of the
induction of an enzyme or other cellular component in a population of
growing cells. To visualize this, suppose that synthesis of an enzyme is
initiated at some time in all the cells in the population and thereafter
the synthesis rate per cell remains constant. What will the enzyme level
per cell be at later times?

  One  way  to  handle  this  problem  is  to  consider  a  closely  related
problem we can readily solve. Suppose that synthesis of the enzyme had
begun many generations earlier and thereafter the synthesis rate per cell
had  remained  constant.  Since  the  synthesis  of  the  enzyme  had  been
initiated many cell doublings earlier, by the time of our consideration,
the  cells  are  in  a  steady  state  and  the  relative  enzyme  level  per  cell
remains constant. As the cell mass doubles from 1 to 2 to 4, and so on,
the amount of the enzyme, A, also doubles, from A to 2A to 4A, and so
on. The differences in the amount of the enzyme at the different times
give  the  amounts  that  were  synthesized  in  each  doubling time. Now
consider the situation if the same number of cells begins with no enzyme
but instead begins synthesis at the same rate per cell as the population
that had been induced at a much earlier time (see the last row in the
table).  At  the  beginning,  no  enzyme  is  present,  but  during  the  first
doubling time, an amount A of the enzyme can be synthesized by the
cells.  In  the  next  doubling  time,  the  table  shows  that  the  cells  can
synthesize an amount 2A of the enzyme, so that after two doubling times
the total amount of enzyme present is 3A. After another doubling time
the amount of enzyme present is 7A. Thus at successive doublings after
induction the enzyme level is 1⁄2, 3⁄4, 7⁄8,... of the final asymptotic value.

Age Distribution in Populations of Growing Cells

The cells in a population of freely growing cells are not all alike. A newly
divided cell grows, doubles in volume, and divides into two daughter

cells. Consequently, freely growing populations contain twice as many
cells that have just divided as cells about to divide. The distribution of
cell ages present in growing populations is an important consideration
in a number of molecular biology experiments, one of which is men-
tioned in Chapter 3. Therefore we will derive the distribution of ages
present in such populations.

Consider an idealized case where cells grow until they reach the age
of 1, at which time they divide. In reality most cells do not divide at
exactly this age, but the ages at which cell division occurs cluster around
a peak. To derive the age distribution, let N(a,t)da be the number of cells
with age between a and a + da at time t. For convenience, we omit writing
the da. Since the number of cells of age a at time t must be the same as
the number of zero-age cells at time t-a, N(a,t) = N(0,t -a). Since the
numbers of cells at any age are growing exponentially, N(0,t) = N(0,0)eµt,
and N(a,t) = N(0,t-a) = N(0,t)e-µa. Therefore the probability that a cell is
of age a, p(a), is p(0)e-µa = p(0)2-a/Td (Fig. 1.11). 

1.1. Propose an explanation for the following facts known about E.
coli: appreciable volume exists between the inner membrane and the
peptidoglycan layer; the inner membrane is too weak to withstand the
osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm and must be supported by a strong,
rigid structure; and no spacers have been discovered that could hold the
inner membrane away from the peptidoglycan layer.

1.2. If the E. coli interior were water at pH 7, how many H+ ions would

exist within the cell at any instant? 

1.3. If a population of cells growing exponentially with a doubling
time Td were contaminated at one part in 107 with cells whose doubling
time is 0.95 Td, how many doublings will be required until 50% of the
cells are contaminants?

1.4. If an enzyme is induced and its synthesis per cell is  constant,
show that there is a final upper-bound less than 100% of cellular protein
that this enzyme can constitute. When the enzyme has reached this level,
what is the relation between the rate of synthesis of the enzyme and the
rate of dilution of the enzyme caused by increase of cellular volume due
to growth? 

1.5. In a culture of cells in balanced exponential growth, an enzyme
was induced at time t = 0. Before induction the enzyme was not present,
and at times very long after induction it constituted 1% of cell protein.
What is the fraction of cellular protein constituted by this protein at any
time t > 0 in terms of the cell doubling time? Ignore the 1 min or so lag
following induction until the enzyme begins to appear.

 1.6. In a culture of cells in balanced exponential growth, an enzyme
was  fully  induced  at  some  very  early  time,  and  the  level  of  enzyme
ultimately reached 1% of total protein. At time t = 0 the synthesis of
enzyme was repressed. What fraction of cellular protein is constituted
by the enzyme for t > 0 (a) if the repressed rate of synthesis is 0 and (b)
if the repressed rate of synthesis is 0.01 of the fully induced rate? 

1.7. If the concentration of a typical amino acid in a bacterium is 10-3
M,  estimate  how  long  this  quantity,  without  replenishment,  could
support  protein  synthesis  at  the  rate  that  yields  1 ×  10-13  g  of  newly
synthesized protein with a cell doubling time of 30 min.

1.8. If a typical protein can diffuse from one end to the other of a cell
in 1/250 sec when it encounters viscosity the same as that of water, how
long is required if the viscosity is 100 times greater? 

 1.9. A protein of molecular weight 30,000 daltons is in solution of
200 mg/ml. What is the average distance separating the centers of the
molecules? If protein has a density of 1.3, what fraction of the volume
of such a solution actually is water?

synthesis of a series of precursors P1, P2, Pn proceeding through a series
of pools Si.

P1→P2→P3→  →Pn
S1→S2→S3→  →Sn

Suppose the withdrawal of a precursor molecule Pi from pool Si, and
its maturation to Si+1 is random. Suppose that at t = 0 all subsequently
synthesized precursors P1 are radioactively labeled at constant specific
activity.  Show  that  at  the  beginning,  the  radioactive  label  increases
proportional to tn in pool Sn.

addition of the amino acid, the cell completely stops its own synthesis
of the amino acid and that there is no leakage of the amino acid out of
the  cell.  For  about  the  first  15  sec,  the  incorporation  of  radioactive
amino acid into protein increases as t2 and thereafter as t. Show how
this delayed entry of radioactive amino acids into protein results from
the pool of free nonradioactive amino acid in the cells at the time the

how to calculate the concentration of this internal pool. Use data of Fig.

1.14. Consider a more realistic case for cell division than was consid-
ered in the text. Suppose that cells do not divide precisely when they
reach age 1 but that they have a probability given by the function f(a)
of dividing when they are of age a. What is the probability that a cell is
of age a in this case?

Chromosome Structure

Thus far we have considered the structure of cells and a few facts about
their functioning. In the next few chapters we will be concerned with
the structure, properties, and biological synthesis of the molecules that
have been particularly important in molecular biology—DNA, RNA, and
protein. In this chapter we consider DNA and RNA. The structures of
these two molecules make them well suited for their major biological
roles  of  storing  and  transmitting  information.  This  information  is
fundamental to the growth and survival of cells and organisms because
it specifies the structure of the molecules that make up a cell.

Information can be stored by any object that can possess more than
one distinguishable state. For example, we could let a stick six inches
long  represent  one  message  and  a  stick  seven  inches  long  represent
another message. Then we could send a message specifying one of the
two alternatives merely by sending a stick of the appropriate length. If
we could measure the length of the stick to one part in ten thousand,
we  could  send  a  message  specifying  one  of  ten  thousand  different
alternatives with just one stick. Information merely limits the alterna-
tives.

We will see that the structure of DNA is particularly well suited for
the  storage  of  information.  Information  is  stored  in  the  linear  DNA
molecule by the particular sequence of four different elements along its
length. Furthermore, the structure of the molecule or molecules—two
are usually used—is sufficiently regular that enzymes can copy, repair,
and  read  out  the stored  information  independent  of its  content. The
duplicated information storage scheme also permits repair of damaged
information and a unified mechanism of replication.

21

22  Nucleic Acid and Chromosome Structure

One of the cellular uses of RNA, discussed in later chapters, is as a
temporary  information  carrier.  Consequently,  RNA  must  also  carry
information,  but  ordinarily  it  does  not  participate  in  replication  or
repair  activities.  In  addition  to  handling  information,  some  types  of
RNA molecules have been found to have structural or catalytic activities.
The ability of RNA to perform all these roles has led to the belief that in
the evolution of life, RNA appeared before DNA or protein.

The Regular Backbone Of DNA

The chemical structure of DNA is a regular backbone of 2’-deoxyriboses,
joined by 3’-5’ phosphodiester bonds (Fig. 2.1). The information carried
by the molecule is specified by bases attached to the 1’ position of the
deoxyriboses. Four bases are used: the purines adenine and guanine,
and the pyrimidines cytosine and thymine. The units of base plus ribose
or deoxyribose are called nucleosides, and if phosphates are attached to
the sugars, the units are called nucleotides.

The  chemical  structure  of  RNA  is  similar  to  that  of  DNA.  The
backbone  of  RNA  uses  riboses  rather  than  2’-deoxyriboses,  and  the
methyl group on the thymine is absent, leaving the pyrimidine uracil.
Clearly the phosphate-sugar-phosphate-sugar along the backbones of
DNA and RNA are regular. Can anything be done to make the informa-
tion storage portion of the molecule regular as well? At first glance this
seems impossible because the purines and the pyrimidines are different
sizes and shapes. As Watson and Crick noticed however, pairs of these
molecules, adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine, do possess regular
shapes (Fig. 2.2). The deoxyribose residues on both A-T and G-C pairs
are  separated  by  the  same  distance  and  can  be  at  the  same  relative
orientations  with  respect  to  the  helix  axis.  Not  only  are  these  pairs
regular, but they are stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds. The A-T pair
generally can form two hydrogen bonds and the G-C base pair can form

three hydrogen bonds between the respective bases. Finally, the base
pairs A-T and G-C can stack via hydrophobic interactions.

Hydrogen bonds can form when a hydrogen atom can be shared by
a donor such as an amino group and an acceptor such as a carbonyl
group.  The  hydrogen  bonds  between  the  bases  of  DNA  are  strong
because  in  all  cases  the  three  atoms  participating  in  hydrogen  bond
formation lie in nearly straight lines. In addition to the familiar Wat-
son-Crick pairings of the bases, other interactions between the bases
have been observed and are also biologically important. These alterna-
tive structures frequently occur in tRNA and also are likely to exist in
the terminal structures of chromosomes, called telomeres.

Grooves in DNA and Helical Forms of DNA

Watson and Crick deduced the basic structure of DNA by using three
pieces of information: X-ray diffraction data, the structures of the bases,
and Chargaff’s findings that, in most DNA samples, the mole fraction of
guanine equals that of cytosine, as well as the mole fraction of adenine
equals that of thymine. The Watson-Crick structure is a pair of oppo-
sitely oriented, antiparallel, DNA strands that wind around one another
in  a  right-handed  helix.  That  is,  the  strands  wrap  clockwise  moving
down the axis away from an observer. Base pairs A-T and G-C lie on the
interior of the helix and the phosphate groups on the outside.

In semicrystalline fibers of native DNA at one moisture content, as
well as in some crystals of chemically synthesized DNA, the helix repeat
is  10  base  pairs  per  turn.  X-ray  fiber  diffraction  studies  of  DNA  in
different  salts  and  at  different  humidities  yield  forms  in  which  the
repeats vary from 9  1⁄3 base pairs per turn to 11 base pairs per turn.
Crystallographers have named the different forms A, B, and C (Table
2.1). 

More recent diffraction studies of crystals of short oligonucleotides
of specific sequence have revealed substantial base to base variation in
the  twist  from  one  base  to  the  next.  Therefore,  it  is  not  at  all  clear

whether  it  is  meaningful  to  speak  of  the  various  forms  of  the  DNA.
Nonetheless, on average, natural DNA, that is DNA with all four bases
represented in random sequence over short distances, has a conforma-
tion most closely represented by B-form DNA.

The A, B, and C forms of DNA are all helical. That is, as the units of
phosphate-deoxyribose-base:base-deoxyribose-phosphate  along  the
DNA are stacked, each succeeding base pair unit is rotated with respect
to the preceding unit. The path of the phosphates along the periphery
of the resulting structure is helical and defines the surface of a circular

cylinder  just  enclosing  the  DNA.  The  base  pair  unit  is  not  circular,
however, and from two directions it does not extend all the way to the
enclosing  cylinder.  Thus  a  base  pair  possesses  two  indentations.  Be-
cause the next base pair along the DNA helix is rotated with respect to
the preceding base, its indentations are also rotated. Thus, moving along
the DNA from base to base, the indentations wind around the cylinder
and form grooves.

Fig. 2.3 shows a helix generated from a rectangle approximating the
base pair unit of B DNA. Note that the rectangle is offset from the helix
axis. As a result of this offset, the two grooves generated in the helix are
of different depths and slightly different widths. The actual widths of
the two grooves can be seen more clearly from the side view of the three
dimensional  helix  in  which  the  viewpoint  is  placed  so  that  you  are
looking directly along the upper pair of grooves. 

Grooves in DNA and Helical Forms of DNA  25

Major groove

Minor groove

In  actual  DNA,  the  deoxyribose-phosphate  units  are  not  aligned
parallel  to  the  base  pairs  as  they  were  represented  in  the  rectangle
approximation above.  The  units are both oriented toward one of the
grooves. This narrows one of the grooves on the helical DNA molecule
and widens the other. The two grooves are therefore called the minor
and major grooves of the DNA. Thus, the displacement of the base pair
from  the  helix  axis  primarily  affects  the  relative  depth  of  the  two
grooves, and the twisted position of the phosphates relative to the bases
primarily affects the widths of the grooves.

The A-form of DNA is particularly interesting because the base pairs
are displaced so far from the helix axis that the major groove becomes
very deep and narrow and the minor groove is barely an indentation.
Helical RNA most often assumes conformations close to the A-form.
Additional  factors  such  as  twist  and  tilt  of  the  base  pairs  which  are

present in the A and C-forms of DNA, but largely absent in the B-form,
have lesser effects on the width and depth of the grooves. Unexpectedly,
even a left-helical form can form under special conditions, but thus far
this Z-form DNA has not been found to play any significant biological
role.

Helical structures can also form from a single strand of RNA or DNA
if it folds back upon itself. The two most common structures are hairpins
and pseudoknots. In a pseudoknot, bases in the loop form additional
base pairs with nucleotides beyond the hairpin region.

Dissociation and Reassociation of Base-paired Strands

Heating DNA in solution breaks the hydrogen bonds between   the A-T
and G-C base pairs, unstacks the bases, and destroys the double-helical
structure of the DNA. Such a process is called melting. Generally, not
all the bonds break at one temperature, and DNA exhibits a transition
zone  between  fully  double-stranded  DNA  and  fully  melted  DNA  that
often is 15° wide. The midpoint of this melting zone is defined as the
melting  temperature,  which  occurs  at  about  95°  in  0.1  M  NaCl. The
actual value of the melting temperature, however, depends on the base
composition of the DNA, for the three hydrogen bonds in G-C base pairs
provide more stability than the two found in A-T base pairs. The ionic
composition of the solution also affects the melting temperature. The
higher  the  concentration  of  an  ion  such  as  sodium,  the  greater  the
shielding between the negatively charged phosphates and the higher the
melting temperature. A divalent ion such as magnesium is still more
effective in raising the melting temperature of DNA.

Melting can be observed in a variety of ways. One of the simplest is
based on the fact that unstacked bases have a higher absorbance in the
ultraviolet region of the spectrum than stacked, paired bases (Fig. 2.4).
Therefore the absorbance of DNA in the ultraviolet region increases as
the DNA melts, and by following the optical density of a DNA solution
as a function of temperature, a melting curve can be obtained.

A  most  remarkable  property  of  denatured  DNA  is  its  ability  to
renature in vitro to re-form double-stranded DNA. This re-formation of
double-stranded DNA usually is very precise and exactly in register. Two
strands may renature to the native double-helical form if their sequences
are complementary, that is, if their sequences permit extensive forma-
tion of hydrogen-bonded base pairs.

The  ability of self-complementary sequences to hybridize  together
and form a double helix is not unique to DNA; RNA can also do this,
and  it  is  possible  in  vitro  to  form  RNA-DNA  hybrids  or  RNA-RNA
duplexes. The ability of nucleic acids to renature has been extremely
important in the development of molecular biology as it has provided
ways of detecting the presence of small quantities of specific sequences
of  RNA  or  DNA  and  in  some  cases  to  determine  their  intracellular
locations through their ability to form sequence-specific duplexes.

Reading Sequence Without Dissociating Strands

Can  the  sequence  of  the  DNA  be  recognized  without  destroying  its
double helical structure? Since thousands of regulatory proteins must
bind to their cognate regulatory sequences near the genes they regulate,
it  is  crucial  that  these  proteins  be  able  to  recognize  their  binding
sequences without requiring that the DNA strands be separated.

Sequence-dependent effects can be seen in the slight structural dif-
ferences found in crystallized oligonucleotides. It is possible that pro-
teins could utilize these structural differences and ignore the chemical
differences between the bases. For example, a protein might recognize
its correct binding site strictly by the locations of phosphates in space.
The regulator of the trp operon in Escherichia coli appears to recognize
its  binding  site  utilizing  such  principles  because  it  appears  to  make
almost no base-specific hydrogen bonds.

The  second  possibility  for  recognition  of  sequences  is  to  read  the
chemical  structures  of  the  bases.  Hydrogen  bonds  can  be  made  to
donors and acceptors in both the major and minor grooves as shown in

the schematic (Fig. 2.5). Considering the typical flexibility in proteins,
it becomes apparent that distinguishing the four base pairs solely by the
presence or absence of hydrogen bonding capabilities of the four bases
requires a minimum of two hydrogen bonds per base pair in the major
groove. A-T and T-A base pairs cannot be distinguished in the minor
groove. In nature we can expect some proteins to recognize sequence
by  structure  determination,  some  proteins  to  recognize  sequence  by
hydrogen  bonding  to  the  portions of  the  bases exposed  in  the  major
groove, some to utilize additional interactions to the methyl group of
thymine, and many to utilize a combination of all these methods.

Electrophoretic Fragment Separation

The  phosphate  backbones  of  DNA  and  RNA  molecules  give  them  a
uniform  charge  per  unit  length.  Therefore,  upon  electrophoresis
through polyacrylamide or agarose gels, molecules  will migrate at rates
largely independent of their sequences. The frictional or retarding forces
the  gels  exert  on  the  migrating  molecules  increase  sharply  with  the
length of the DNA or RNA so that the larger the molecule, the slower it
migrates through a gel. This is the basis of the exceptionally valuable
technique  of  electrophoresis.  In  general,  two  molecules  whose  sizes
differ by 1% can be separated. Polyacrylamide gels are typically used
for molecules from five to perhaps 5,000 base pairs, and agarose gels
are used for molecules 1,000 base pairs and larger.

Following electrophoresis, the locations of specific DNA fragments
can be located by staining or by autoradiography. Ethidium bromide is
a  most  useful  stain  for  this  purpose.  The  molecule  is  nonpolar  and

Bent DNA Sequences  29

readily intercalates between bases of DNA. In the nonpolar environment
between the bases, its fluorescence is increased about 50 times. There-
fore a gel can be soaked in a dilute solution of ethidium bromide and
illumination  with an ultraviolet  lamp  reveals the location of  DNA  as
bands glowing cherry-red. As  little as 5 ng of DNA in a band  can be
detected by this method. For detection of smaller quantities of DNA, the
DNA  can  be  radioactively  labeled  before  electrophoresis.  A  simple
enzymatic  method  of doing  this is  to use the  enzyme polynucleotide
kinase to transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the 5’-OH of a DNA
molecule. After electrophoresis, a radioactive DNA band is located by
exposing a photographic film to the gel and developing. The radioactive
decay of the 32P sensitizes the silver halide crystals in the film so that
upon development, black particles of silver remain to reveal positions
of radioactive DNA or RNA in the gel.

Above about 50,000 base pairs long, all DNA migrates in gels at about
the same rate. This results from the DNA assuming a conformation in
which its charge to frictional force ratio is independent of its length as
it snakes through the gel in a reptilian fashion. It was empirically found,
however, that brief periodic changes in the direction of the electric field
or polarity reverses often will separate still larger DNA molecules. This
techniques  is  called  pulsed  field  electrophoresis.  Overall,  the  major
motion of the DNA is in one direction, but it is punctuated by reversals
or changes in direction from once per second to once per minute. The
change  in  migration  direction  destroys  the  structure  of  the  species
whose migration rates are independent of size, and for a short while,
the long DNA molecules migrate at rates related to their sizes. Additional
size separation is achieved in these electrophoretic techniques because
the larger the molecule, the longer it takes to achieve the steady-state
snaking state. By these means, molecules as large as 1,000,000 base pair
chromosomes can be separated by size.

Bent DNA Sequences

If a series of small bends in DNA are added coherently, together they
generate a significant bend. Most surprisingly, a short DNA fragment of

several hundred base pairs containing such a bend migrates anomal-
ously slowly in electrophoresis. Such abnormally migrating fragments
were recognized soon after DNA sequencing became possible, but some
time passed before it was realized that the major contributor to bending
is  a  run  of  three  or  four  A’s.  Significant  bends  can  be  generated  by

Bending of DNA is biologically important. Some DNA-binding pro-
teins  bend  DNA,  and  the  natural  bend  of  other  sequences  like  some
origins of DNA replication appears to be essential. Many of the binding
sites of proteins are naturally bent, and the binding of the protein further
bends  the  DNA.  Thus,  the  presence  of  a  bend  in  the  DNA  helps  the
binding of a protein which further bends the DNA. 

The bending generated by a specific DNA sequence or by the binding
of a protein to a specific site can be tested even if the bend is small.
Suppose  the  DNA  in  question  is  connected  to  another  segment  of
“reference” DNA that is known to contain a bend. These bends may add
as shown in Fig. 2.6, or they may cancel. Now consider the consequences
of adding two, four, six, eight, and ten base pairs between the test and
reference regions.  As the additional spacing DNA is added, one segment
is rotated with respect to the other. At some point in the process the two
bends are in the same direction and add and the migration rate of the

segment will be low. At another position of relative rotation, the two
bends cancel one another and the migration rate of the DNA is faster.
Plotting the migration rate as a function of the relative rotation or spacer
DNA  added  (Fig.  2.7)    can  prove  the  existence  of  a  bend,  as  well  as
determine its direction and magnitude.

Measurement of Helical Pitch

It is not straightforward to determine the helical repeat of DNA under
in vivo conditions. Such measurements have been made, and will be
described later. Here we shall consider measuring the helical pitch in
vitro of linear DNA not bound to any proteins.

Klug  and  co-workers  found  that  DNA  can  bind  tightly  to  the  flat
surface of  mica  or  calcium phosphate  crystals. While bound to  such
surfaces, only a portion of the cylindrical DNA is susceptible to cleavage
by DNAse I, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone
of DNA (Fig. 2.8). Consider the consequences of:  1. utilizing an homoge-
nous population of DNA molecules, 2. radioactively labeling each mole-
cule  on  one  end  with  32PO4,  3.  rotationally  orientating  all  the  DNA
molecules similarly, i.e. the 5’ end of the labeled strand begins in contact
with the solid support, 4. performing a partial digestion with DNAse I,
so that on average, each DNA molecule is cleaved only once.

In the population, the labeled strand will be cleaved more frequently
at those positions where it is on the part of the helix up away from the
support, and thus cleavages will be concentrated at positions 1⁄2, 11⁄2,
21⁄2  etc.  helical  turns  from  the  labeled  end.  A  similar  population  of
labeled  DNA  digested  while  in  solution  will  possess  some  molecules

support. While bound to the support, and while free in solution, the DNA is
lightly digested with DNAse, the denatured fragments are separated according
to size by electrophoresis and an autoradiograph is made of the gel. When the
DNA is on the solid support, DNAse has only limited access.

cleaved at every position. Electrophoretic separation of the populations
yields the pattern shown (Fig. 2.8). In the sample cleaved while on the
flat support most cleavages, and hence the darkest bands, are separated
by 10 or 11 base pairs. The DNA cleaved in solution shows all sizes of
DNA fragments. 

Topological Considerations in DNA Structure

Topology introduces a structural feature in addition to the base-paired
and  helical  aspects  of  DNA.  The  origin  of  this  structure  can  best  be
understood by considering a mathematical property of two closed rings.
The number of times that one ring encircles or links the other must be
an integral number. It cannot be changed without physically opening

one of the rings. That is, their linking number is a topological invariant.
Many types of DNA molecules found in cells are covalently closed circles
because each strand is circular. Hence the concept of a linking number
applies to DNA molecules obtained from many sources. The concept
also applies to linear DNA if the ends are prevented from freely rotating,
either because of the extreme length of the DNA or because the DNA is
attached to something else.

The forces tending to hold double-stranded DNA in a right-handed
helix with about 10.5 base pairs per turn add a dimension to the analysis
of  the  structures  of  covalently  closed  circles.  These  forces  are  suffi-
ciently great that the linking number, Lk, generally resolves itself into
two  easily  distinguished  components:  the  twist,  Tw,  which  in  DNA’s
usual right-helical form has a value of 1 per each 10.5 base pairs, and
the writhe, Wr. Twist is the local wrapping of one of the two strands
about the other. If Lk does not equal Tw, then the discrepancy must be
made up from a global writhing of the molecule as such global effects
can  alter  the  actual  number  of  times  one  strand  encircles the  other.
These global effects are called supercoiling or superhelical turns. Their
computation is most difficult because the entire path of the DNA duplex
must  be  considered.  To  repeat,  for  any  covalently  closed  double-
stranded DNA molecule, no matter how it is distorted, unless its phos-
phodiester backbone is broken, Lk = Tw + Wr. This equation sometimes
is written τ = α + β where τ = Lk, α = Tw, and β = Wr. It is curious that
the topological invariant Lk equals the sum of two terms, each of which
is not invariant.

It is convenient to normalize the deviation of the linking number from
the normal, unconstrained value, Lk0. Since the normal linking is 1 per

Generating DNA with Superhelical Turns  33

10.5 base pairs of DNA, linking values other than this must change either
the twist, the writhe, or both. Rather than just give the linking number
deviation for a DNA molecule, it is more informative to give the linking
number deviation per unit length of the DNA, Lk - Lk0 divided by Lk0 .
This value  is denoted by σ. Typical values of σ in DNA extracted from
bacterial  cells are  -0.02 to  -0.06.  Colloquially σ is called supercoiling
density,  but  it must  be  remembered  that  part  of  the  linking number
deviation goes into changing the twist of the DNA molecules and part
goes into generating writhe. 

Generating DNA with Superhelical Turns

To understand how we may experimentally vary Lk, and consequently
the degree of supercoiling, let us consider the lambda phage DNA. The
molecules of this DNA are about 50,000 base pairs long and possess what
are called sticky ends; that is, the ends of the DNA duplex are not flush.
As shown in Fig. 2.9, the 5’ ends protrude in a single-stranded region of
12 bases. The sequence of the left end is complementary to the sequence
of the right end. These sticky ends can be reassociated together to form
a circle, which sometimes is called a Hershey circle after its discoverer.
The  phosphodiester  bonds  are  not  contiguous  around  the  Hershey
circle; hence its other name, a nicked circle. Circles having a break in
only one of their backbones also are called nicked.

Nicks can be covalently sealed with DNA ligase. This enzyme seals
the phosphodiester backbone of DNA between nicks that have a 5’-phos-
phate  and  a  3’-hydroxyl.  Following  ligation  which  forms  circles,  Lk
cannot  be  altered  without  breaking  the  backbone  of  one  of  the  two
strands.  Hence,  the  sum  of  Tw,  the  right-helical  turns,  and  Wr,  the
number of superhelical turns, is fixed. If under fixed buffer and tem-
perature conditions,  we  were to  anneal the ends of the lambda DNA
together  and  then  seal  with  ligase,  the  number  of superhelical  turns
would be zero and Lk would be about 5,000, about one turn per ten base

tive twist.

pairs.  For  convenience  let  us  say  that  the  number  is  exactly  5,000.
Furthermore, if we were to introduce distortion or even to wrap this
DNA around a protein, the sum of Tw and Wr must still remain 5,000.
Suppose  instead,  the  annealing  and  sealing  had  been  done  in  the
presence of ethidium bromide. Its intercalation between bases pushes
the bases apart and partly untwists the DNA in this region because the
phosphodiester backbone of the DNA cannot lengthen (Fig. 2.10). Hence
the amount by which one strand wraps around another is decreased by
the intercalation of the ethidium bromide. In the common B form of
DNA, the bases are twisted about 34° per base, but the intercalation of
an ethidium bromide molecule removes 24° of this twist. The number
of helical turns in a lambda DNA molecule sealed in the presence of a
particular concentration of ethidium bromide might be about 100 less
than the number contained in a lambda DNA molecule sealed in the
absence of ethidium  bromide. Treating with  DNA ligase  under  these
conditions would produce a molecule with no writhe, Wr = 0, and with
Lk  =  Tw  =  4,900.  If  the  ethidium  bromide  were  then  removed  by
extraction with an organic solvent, Tw would return to near its standard
value of 5,000; but because of the requirement that Tw + Wr = 4,900 be
a constant, Wr would become -100 and the circular DNA would writhe.
It would have 100 negative superhelical turns, or σ or -100/5000 = -0.02.

Measuring Superhelical Turns

Superhelical turns in DNA may introduce distortions or torsion in the
molecules that assist or hinder processes we would like to study such as
recombination or the initiation of transcription. Supercoiling must be
easily  measurable  in  order  to  be  productively  studied.  One  way  to
measure superhelical turns might be to observe the DNA in an electron
microscope and see it twisted upon itself. Quantitation of the superheli-

Ethidium bromide concentration

just  described  with  100  negative  superhelical  turns.  Because  it  is  so
twisted upon itself, the molecule is rather compact and sediments in the
ultracentrifuge at a high rate. If the sedimentation is performed in the
presence of a low concentration of ethidium bromide, a few molecules
will intercalate into the DNA. This will reduce the number of negative
superhelical turns, thereby opening up the DNA, which will sediment
more slowly than it would in the absence of ethidium bromide.

Consider a series of sedimentation measurements made in the pres-
ence of increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide. At higher and
higher concentrations of ethidium bromide, more and more will inter-
calate into the DNA and unwind the DNA more and more. Consequently
the DNA will  become less and  less  compact and  sediment  more and
more slowly (Fig. 2.11). Finally a concentration of ethidium bromide
will be reached where the molecule is completely free of superhelical
turns. At this concentration, the DNA will sediment most slowly. If the
centrifugation is done in the presence of still higher concentrations of
ethidium bromide, the molecule will be found to sediment more rapidly
as  the  DNA  acquires  positive  superhelical  turns  and  becomes  more
compact  again.  The  concentration  of  ethidium  bromide  required  to
generate  the  slowest  sedimentation  rate  can  then  be  related  to  the
number of superhelical turns originally in the DNA via the affinity of
ethidium bromide for DNA and the untwisting produced per interca-
lated ethidium bromide molecule.

Even more convenient than centrifugation for quantitation of super-
helical turns has been electrophoresis of DNA through agarose. Under
some conditions DNA molecules of the same length but with different
linking  numbers  can  be  made  to  separate  from  one  another  upon
electrophoresis. The separation results from the fact that two molecules
with different linking numbers will, on the average during the electro-
phoresis,  possess  different  degrees  of  supercoiling  and  consequently
different compactness. Those molecules that  are  more  greatly super-
coiled during the electrophoresis will migrate more rapidly. Not only
can agarose gels be used for quantitating species with different numbers
of superhelical turns, but any particular species can be extracted out of
the gel and used in subsequent experiments.

36  Nucleic Acid and Chromosome Structure

The agarose gels show an interesting result. If DNA is ligated to form
covalently  closed circles and then subjected to electrophoresis  under
conditions that separate superhelical forms, it is found that not all of
the DNA molecules possess the same linking number. There is a distri-
bution centered about the linking number corresponding to zero super-
helical turns, Lk0. This is to be expected because the DNA molecules in
solution are constantly in motion, and a molecule can be ligated into a
covalently closed circle at an instant when it possesses a linking number
unequal to Lk0. These molecules are frozen in a slightly higher average
energy state than those with no superhelical turns. Their exact energy
depends on the twisting spring constant of DNA. The stiffer the DNA,
the smaller the fraction of molecules that will possess any superhelical
turns at the time of sealing. Quantitation of the DNA molecules in the
bands possessing different numbers of superhelical turns permits evalu-
ation via statistical mechanics of the twisting spring constant of DNA.
The ability to measure accurately the number of superhelical turns
in DNA allows a determination of the amount of winding or unwinding
produced by the binding of molecules. For example, unwinding meas -
urements first indicated that RNA polymerase melts about 8 bases of
DNA when it binds tightly to lambda DNA. Later, more precise meas-
urements have shown that the unwinding is closer to 15 base pairs. This
unwinding was shown directly by binding RNA polymerase to nicked
circular  DNA  and  then  sealing  with  ligase  to  form  covalently  closed
circles, removing the RNA polymerase, and measuring the number of
superhelical turns in the DNA. The first measurements were done by
accurately comparing the sedimentation velocity of the DNA sealed in
the presence and in the absence of RNA polymerase. Later experiments
have used a better DNA substrate and have used gel electrophoresis. 

Another  way  to  measure  the  winding  produced  by  binding  of  a
molecule  to  DNA  is  to  measure  the  affinity  of  a  molecule  for  DNA
samples  containing  different  numbers  of  superhelical  turns.  This
method is based on the fact that a protein which introduces negative
superhelical turns as it binds to DNA will bind much more tightly to a
DNA molecule already containing negative superhelical turns. From the
thermodynamics of the situation, this type of approach is very sensitive.

Determining Lk, Tw, and Wr in Hypothetical Structures 

A number of the fundamental processes in molecular biology involve
the binding and  interactions of proteins with DNA, and the covalent
cutting  and  rejoining  of  DNA.  Much  insight  into  these  processes  is
provided by learning whether a portion of the DNA duplex is melted,
and how the cutting and rejoining is performed. Often these processes
affect the linking number or twist of the DNA, and both can be measured
before and after the reaction. Then the effects of possible models on
these numbers can be compared to experimental results. The determi-
nation of linking number, twist, and superhelical turns in a structure
can  sometimes  be  tricky,  and  in  the  general  situation  is  a  relatively
difficult mathematical problem. At our level of analysis, we can proceed

with straightforward approximations based on the fact that the linking
number is the number of times that one DNA strand encircles the other.
It  is  useful  for  this  number  to  have  a  sign  that  is  dependent  on  the
orientation of the strands. Therefore, to determine the linking number
of  a  structure,  draw  arrows  on  the  two  strands  pointing  in  opposite
directions, for example, pointing in the 5’ to 3’ direction on each. At each
point  where  the  two  different  strands  cross,  assign  a  +  or  -  value
dependent on the orientation. If the upper strand at a crossover can be
brought  into  correspondence  with the  lower strand with a  clockwise

+

Clockwise

-

rotation, assign a +; if a counterclockwise rotation is required, assign a
-. The linking number equals the sum of these values divided by 2, as
shown in Fig. 2.12.

Viewing  the  DNA  duplex  as  a  ribbon  provides  one  way  to  picture
twist. Consider a straight line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the
ribbon and through both edges. The rotation of this line as it is moved
down  the  axis  gives  the  twist.  For  a  given  structure,  the  writhing  or
superhelical turns is most easily given by whatever value Wr must have
to make Lk = Tw + Wr.

Altering Linking Number

Cells have enzymes that alter the linking numbers of covalently closed
DNA molecules. Wang, who found the first such protein, called it omega,
but  now  it  is  often  called  DNA  topoisomerase  I.  Astoundingly,  this
enzyme  removes  negative  superhelical  turns,  one  at  a  time,  without
hydrolyzing ATP or any other energy-rich small molecule. It can act on
positively supercoiled DNA, but only if a special trick is used to generate
a single-stranded stretch for the enzyme to bind to. No nicks are left in

the  DNA  after  omega  has  acted.  Purified,  covalently  closed  lambda
phage  DNA  extracted  from lambda-infected  cells  is  found  to  possess
about 120 negative superhelical turns. Incubation of omega with this
DNA increases the linking number until only about 20 negative super-
helical turns remain (Fig. 2.13). The enzyme appears to remove twists,
and hence superhelical turns, in a controlled way. It binds to the DNA
and  then  interrupts  the phosphodiester backbone of one strand  by a
phosphotransfer reaction that makes a high-energy phosphate bond to
the  enzyme.  In  this  state  the  enzyme  removes  one  twist  and  then
re-forms the phosphodiester bond in the DNA.

Additional enzymes capable of altering the linking number of DNA
have also been discovered. The topoisomerase from eukaryotic cells can
apparently bind double-stranded DNA and will remove positive super-
helical  turns  as  well  as  negative.  Cells  possess  another  remarkable
enzyme.  This  enzyme,  DNA  gyrase  or  DNA  topoisomerase  II,  adds
negative superhelical turns; as expected, energy from the hydrolysis of
ATP is required for this reaction.

Studies of the activity of topoisomerases I and II, omega and gyrase,
have shown that these enzymes can best be thought of as functioning
by strand passage mechanisms. Where two DNA duplexes cross, gyrase,
with the consumption of an ATP molecule, can permit the duplex lying
below to be cut, to pass the first, and to be rejoined. Topoisomerase I

can proceed by the same sort of pathway, but it passes one strand of a
duplex through the other strand, having first denatured a region where

strand crossing is to occur (Fig. 2.14). These are known as sign-inversion
pathways because they change the sign of the linking number that is
contributed by a point of crossing of the two DNA strands.

The  sign-inversion  pathway  has  a  particularly  useful  property:  it
permits  DNA  duplexes  to  interpenetrate  one  another.  Gyrase  is  an
enzyme that can untangle knots in DNA! Undoubtedly this property is
of great value to the cell as the DNA is compressed into such a small
volume that tangles seem inevitable. In general, enzymes that cut and
rejoin DNA are topoisomerases. 

Biological Significance of Superhelical Turns

As explained above, supercoiling results from a linking number deficit
in covalently closed, double-stranded circles. If such DNA did not form
supercoils, it would possess a twist of less than one per 10.5 base pairs.
It might be one twist per 11 base pairs, for example. Since DNA can
wrap upon itself globally as it tries to attain a local twisting of once per
10.5  base  pairs,  it  forms  supercoils.  Of  course,  the  DNA  resists  the
introduction  of  too  many  superhelical  turns.  Therefore,  not  all  the
linking number deficit is taken up by supercoiling. The deficit is parti-
tioned between supercoiling and reducing the local twist of the DNA.
The greater the linking number deficit, the greater the supercoiling and
the greater the untwisting of the DNA. Untwisting DNA helps separate
its  strands.  Therefore,  negative  supercoiling  assists  the  formation  of
melted sections of DNA. This is the situation in vitro with pure DNA
possessing a linking number deficit. What about in vivo?

Does the same DNA in vivo feel such a torsion, or are there unmelted
regions of the DNA here and there, perhaps formed by bound proteins,
that generate the overall linking number deficit? When these proteins
are  removed,  we  would  find  the  linking  number  deficit.  Despite  its
topological linking number deficit, such DNA in vivo would not feel the
torsion described above.

The  considerations  discussed  above  can  also  apply  to  linear  DNA
molecules  if  its  ends  are  prevented  from  free  rotation.  DNA  may  be
constrained  from  free  rotation  because  it  is  attached  to  a  cellular

40  Nucleic Acid and Chromosome Structure

structure or because free rotation is hindered due to its great length or
the bulkiness of proteins that may be bound to it.

Several experiments suggest that DNA in bacteria not only possesses
superhelical turns but also is under a superhelical torsion. The in vitro
integration reaction of lambda phage, in which a special set of enzymes
catalyzes the insertion of covalently closed lambda DNA circles into the
chromosome, proceeds only when the lambda DNA possesses negative
superhelical turns. In fact, tracking down what permitted the in vitro
reaction to work led to the discovery of DNA gyrase. Presumably the
enzymology of the in vitro and in vivo integration reactions is the same,
and the supercoiling requirement means that in vivo the chromosome
possesses superhelical turns.

A second experiment also suggests that DNA in normally growing E.
coli contains superhelical torsion. Adding inhibitors of the DNA gyrase,
such as  nalidixic  acid  or oxolinic acid,  which  block  activity  of the A
subunit of the enzyme, or novobiocin or coumermycin, which inhibit
the  B  subunit,  alters  the  rates  of  expression  of  different  genes.  The
activities of some genes increase while the activities of others decrease.
This shows that the drug effects are not a general physiological response
and that the DNA must be supercoiled in vivo. Yet another indication
of the importance of supercoiling to cells is shown by the behavior of
DNA topoisomerase I mutants. Such mutants grow slowly, and faster-
growing mutants frequently arise. These are found to possess mutations
that compensate  for the absence of the  topoisomerase  I by a second
mutation that reduces the activity of gyrase, topoisomerase II. A third
line of experimentation also suggests that the DNA in bacteria, but not
eukaryotic  cells,  experiences  an  unwinding  torsion  from  the  linking
number deficit. This is the rate at which an intercalating drug called
psoralen  intercalates  and  reacts  with  DNA  when  irradiated  with  UV
light. The reaction rate is torsion-dependent. Altogether, it seems rea-
sonable to conclude that the DNA in bacterial cells not only is super-
coiled but also is under a supercoiling torsion.

The Linking Number Paradox of Nucleosomes

A paradox is raised by the structure of nucleosomes. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, the DNA in eukaryotic cells is wrapped around nucleosomes.
DNA  in  the  B  conformation  wraps  about  1.8  times  around  a  core
consisting of pairs of the four histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. In the

presence of the histone H1, the wrapping is extended to just about two
complete turns. This histone both serves to complete the wrapping as
well as to connect from one nucleosome to the next. Superficially, the

General Chromosome Structure  41

wrapped  nucleosome  structure  appears  to  possess  two  superhelical
turns, and yet when the protein is removed, the DNA is found to possess
only about one superhelical turn for each nucleosome it had contained.
One explanation for the paradox could be that the path of the DNA
between  nucleosomes  negates  part  of  the  writhe  generated  by  the
wrapping. Because electron microscopy suggests that the connection
from one nucleosome to the next is regular, tricky topology connecting
nucleosomes seems not to be the explanation. 

Another explanation for the paradox is that while the DNA is wrapped
on the nucleosome, it is overwound. Upon removal of the nucleosome,
the winding of the DNA returns to normal, reducing the twist of the
DNA, so that writhe or negative supercoiling is reduced in magnitude
from an average of two per nucleosome to an average of one negative
superhelical  turn  per  nucleosome.  The  linking  number,  twist,  and
writhe  might  be  the  following  while  the  DNA  is  wrapped  on  one
nucleosome, Lk = 20, Tw = 22, Wr = -2, and after removing from the
nucleosome, the same DNA might have the following values, Lk = 20,
Tw  =  21,  Wr  =-1.  The  evidence,  in  fact,  suggests  this  is  part  of  the
explanation.

Analysis of the sequences of DNA found on nucleosomes indicates
that the bends introduced by runs of A’s as described earlier tend to lie
with the minor grooves of such runs in contact with the nucleosomes.
Thus nucleosomes appear to bind to DNA to regions that already are
partially bent. Analysis of the locations of these runs of A’s shows that
they are spaced an average of 10.17 base pairs apart, not 10.5 base pairs
apart.  This  then  partially, but not  fully,  explains  the linking  number
paradox. When this overwound DNA returns to its natural twist of 10.5
base pairs per turn, part of the supercoiling is eliminated. Although this
reduces the supercoiling discrepancy, a new question is raised about the
cause of the overwinding of the DNA.

General Chromosome Structure

The DNA in eukaryotic cells is largely contained in nucleosomes. Sets
of these nucleosomes form solenoids, and the solenoids wrap together
to form yet a larger structure. Within all this compaction, the DNA must
remain accessible to regulatory proteins, to RNA polymerase for tran-
scription, to DNA repair enzymes, and to any other proteins that have
a need for access to the DNA. If a nucleosome is bound to the promoter
for a given gene, RNA polymerase would be denied access, and neces-
sary transcription would not occur. Are there any special mechanisms
that  either  remove  nucleosomes  from  important  regions  of  DNA  or
which prevent their binding there in the first place? The next section
shows how nucleosome positions on DNA can be determined. 

Southern Transfers to Locate Nucleosomes on Genes

Southern transfers are a versatile technique of molecular genetics that
combines  electrophoresis  and  DNA-DNA  or  RNA-DNA  hybridization

Figure 2.15  Use of Southern transfer technology to determine the locations of
nuclease hypersensitive and hyposensitive sites in the vicinity of a gene. Gently
extracted DNA is lightly digested with DNAse, cleaved with a restriction enzyme
at  specific  sites,  denatured,  separated  by  electrophoresis,  transferred  to  a
membrane,  and  then  hybridized  to  a  short  radioactive  oligonucleotide  that
hybridizes near the gene in question. Finally, an autoradiograph is made of the
membrane.

(Fig. 2.15). The application of Southern transfers to various questions
will be mentioned a number of this throughout the book. The power of
the  transfer  and  hybridization  technology  as  applied  to  examining
nucleosome positioning is that it permits determination of the suscep-
tibility  to  DNAse  cleavage  in  the  region  of  whatever  gene  we  are
interested in. This can be done in the presence of DNA from thousands
of other genes. Here we  shall consider the application of this technology
to the problems of ascertaining whether nucleosomes near a specific
gene occupy fixed positions and whether nucleosomes cover regulatory
sequences just ahead of genes. The approach has shown that in front of
many genes are areas apparently not occupied by nucleosomes. This
leaves these regions hypersensitive to hydrolysis by nucleases added to
gently lysed nuclei. The nuclease sensitivity within the genes is much
less due to the presence of nucleosomes. Often such nucleosomes tend
to occupy specific positions.

The DNA for nucleosome position measurements is gently extracted
from nuclei and lightly treated with a nuclease like DNAse I to generate
about one nick per one thousand base pairs. Different molecules will be
nicked in different places, but very few molecules will be nicked in areas
covered  by  nucleosomes.  After  the  digestion,  protein  is  removed  by
extraction with phenol and all the DNA molecules are digested by an

ARS Elements, Centromeres, and Telomeres  43

enzyme  that  cleaves  DNA  at  specific  sequences.  These  enzymes  are
known as restriction enzymes and will be discussed more fully later.

Suppose that such a cleavage site lies several hundred base pairs in
front of the gene we are considering. After the cleavage steps, the DNA
fragments are denatured and the single-stranded fragments are sepa-
rated according to size by electrophoresis. After the electrophoresis, the
fragments are transferred to a sheet of nylon membrane. The transfer
to the membrane preserves the pattern of size-separated fragments. The
membrane can then be incubated in a solution containing radioactive
oligonucleotide  possessing  a  sequence  complementary  to  sequence
from the gene of interest near to the cleavage site. The oligonucleotide
will hybridize to just those DNA fragments possessing this complemen-
tary  sequence.  Hence  the membrane will  be  radioactive  in  the  areas
containing the fragments. In any area of the DNA that was protected
from DNAse I nicking by the presence of a nucleosome, no cleavages
will occur. Hence, there will be no fragments of the size extending from
the position of the restriction enzyme cleavage site to the area occupied
by the nucleosome. Conversely, in areas readily cleaved by the nuclease,
many  different  molecules  will  be  cleaved,  and  therefore  many  DNA
fragments will exist of a length equal to the distance from the restriction
cleavage site to the nuclease-sensitive, nucleosome free, region.

Nucleosome protection experiments show that several hundred nu-
cleotides  in  regions  ahead  of  genes  in  which  regulatory  proteins  are
expected to bind frequently are devoid of nucleosomes. Two factors are
responsible.  First,  regulatory  proteins  can  bind  to  these  regions  and
prevent  nucleosomes  from  binding  there.  Another  reason  is  natural
bending of the DNA. As discussed earlier, DNA is not straight, and most
DNA possesses minor bends. Such bends greatly facilitate the wrapping
of DNA around the histones in the formation of a nucleosome. Thus,
bends in the DNA can position a nucleosome, and this in turn partially
positions  its  neighbors,  generating  a  region  of  phased  nucleosomes.
Such phasing can leave gaps where they are necessary for the binding
of regulatory proteins. 

ARS Elements, Centromeres, and Telomeres

Survival of a chromosome requires three basic properties–replication,
proper segregation upon DNA replication and cell division, and replica-
tion and protection of the ends of the chromosome. Multiple origins of
replication exist in the chromosomes of cells. These origins are called
autonomously replicating sequences, ARS, because they can be cloned
into  DNA  that  will  replicate  on  its  own  in  other  cells.  Such  DNA,
however, does not properly partition itself into daughter cells because
it lacks the necessary signals for segregation. Frequently the daughters
fail to receive a copy of the DNA replicating under ARS control.

Classical cell biology has identified the portion of the chromosome
that is responsible for segregation of the chromosomes into daughter
cells. This is the centromere. As cells divide, the centromeres are pulled
into  the  two  daughter  cells  by  microtubules.  It  has  been  possible  to

44  Nucleic Acid and Chromosome Structure

identify a centromere by seeking a DNA segment from a chromosome
that confers the property of more correct segregation on a DNA element
containing an ARS element.

A  third  necessary  part  to  a  normal  chromosome  is  the  telomere.
Telomeres also have been identified by classical biology as being special.
First,  most  chromosomes  of  eukaryotic  cells  are  linear. This  poses  a
problem  in  DNA  replication  as  the  normal  DNA  polymerase  cannot
elongate to the ends of both strands because it replicates only in a 5’ to
3’  direction. The end of one strand can’t be  reached. Something else
must extend the portion of the strand that cannot be completely repli-
cated. Secondly, since chromosome breakage occasionally occurs, and
has dire consequences to cells, they have evolved a way to try to rescue
broken chromosomes by fancy recombination processes. The normal
ends of chromosomes are inert in these rescue processes by virtue of
special markers called telomeres. These telomeres have been identified
by their properties of permitting the existence of linear artificial chro-
mosomes  that  contain ARS  elements and  centromeres. Interestingly,
telomeres are repeated sequences of five to ten bases, largely of C’s and
G’s. A special enzyme adds these sequences onto single-stranded DNA
possessing the same telomeric sequence. These unusual enzymes must
first recognize the sequence to which they will make additions, and then
they add nucleotides, one at a time, to generate the correct telomeric
structure. They do this making use of an internal RNA molecule that
provides the sequence information needed for the additions.

2.5. During transcription RNA polymerase winds around the DNA. If
the trailing RNA cannot wind around the DNA, show that transcription
tends  to  generate  positive  supercoils  ahead  of  the  polymerase  and
negative supercoils behind the polymerase.

2.6. Consider DNA 50,000 base pairs long containing sticky ends, such
as phage lambda. If the sticky ends are annealed together and the circle
is covalently closed by ligase, several species of superhelically twisted
DNA are formed. These differ from one another by single superhelical
twists, and they can be separated from one another by electrophoresis
through  agarose  in  the  presence  of  moderate  concentrations  of
ethidium  bromide.  How  does  the  resultant  ladder  pattern  change  if
lambda DNA containing an internal deletion of five base pairs is used
in the experiment? How can this method be extended to determine the
helical repeat distance of DNA in solution? 

2.7. A double-stranded DNA fragment 300 base pairs long was labeled
at the 5’ end of one of the strands. This sample was then subjected to a
treatment that removed one nucleotide from a random location from
each duplex. Upon electrophoresis the sample generated a significantly
broadened band. The front quarter of this band and the trailing quarter
of this band were then run on high resolution denaturing gels with the
results shown in Fig. 2.17. Explain.

2.8. Is the activity of DNA topoisomerase I on negative superhelical
DNA and not on positive superhelical DNA proper for this enzyme to
act as the protein to unwind the twisting ahead of the replication fork
that is introduced by DNA replication? 

2.9. Show that negative superhelicity but not positive superhelicity
increases  the  number  of  base  pairs  per  helical  turn  and  assists  the
melting out of a few base pairs.

2.10. In a lambda phage DNA molecule, a sequence of nine base pairs
was  followed  by  three  base  pairs,  and  then  the  complement  of  the
sequence was repeated in reverse order. Show the results of intrastrand
base pairing of these sequences, known as a cruciform. In a covalently
closed  duplex,  how  much  would  the  formation  of  the  cruciform,  as
defined here, change the number of superhelical turns?

2.11. Which pair of bases in Figure 2.18 could be used to extend the

genetic alphabet from A, G, C, and T?

2.12. Show that a sign-inversion pathway such as that proposed for
gyrase changes the number of superhelical twists in a covalently closed
circular DNA molecule by two.

2.13. One method for determining the approximate number of super-
helical turns in a proposed structure is to build it without twists from a
ribbon,  to pull  the ends taut,  and to count the twists. Why  does this
work?

2.14.  Ethidium  bromide  fluoresces  50  to  100  times  more  strongly
when it has intercalated into DNA. How could this property be used to
determine whether DNA from a phage was a covalently closed circle? 
2.15. How many bonds per base pair are there about which rotation

is possible, neglecting those of the deoxyribose ring?

2.16. Assume that the B form of DNA possesses 10.4 base pairs per
turn  and  the  Z  form  possesses  12  base  pairs.  Suppose  that  a  large
plasmid contains a 156-base pair insert of alternating dG, dC. Show that
the conversion of the insert DNA from the B to the Z form will add 28
superhelical turns to the plasmid.

2.17. Suppose electrophoresis on agarose is performed such that the
twist of DNA is the same as it is in solution. A sample of circular DNA
molecules of the same length but possessing -1, 0, and +1 superhelical

the +1 and -1 species be separated? 

2.18. DNA sequences are normally written 5’ to 3’, e.g., 5’-AAG-3’. In
Figure 2.19 this sequence has been imposed on the lower strand in the
major groove. By reference  to a detailed structural  drawing of DNA,
determine whether it should it be represented as on the left or the right.
This  is  equivalent  to  determining  the 5’ and  3’  ends  of  the  two  DNA
strands.

2.19. Devise an assay for catenation and an assay for decatenation of

DNA.

DNA Synthesis

3

One  fundamental  approach  in  the  study  of  complex  systems  is  to
determine the minimal set of purified components that will carry out
the  process  under  investigation.  In  the  case  of  DNA  synthesis,  the
relatively loose association of the proteins involved created problems.
How can one of the components be assayed so that its purification can
be monitored if all the components must be present for DNA synthesis
to occur? We will see in this chapter that the problem was solved, but
the purification of the many proteins required for DNA synthesis was a
monumental task that occupied biochemists and geneticists for many
years. By contrast, the machinery of protein synthesis was much easier
to study because most of it is bound together in a ribosome.

A basic problem facing an organism is maintaining the integrity of
its DNA. Unlike protein synthesis, in which one mistake results in one
altered  protein  molecule,  or  RNA  synthesis,  in  which  one  mistake
ultimately shows up just in the translation products of a single messen-
ger  RNA,  an  uncorrected  mistake  in  the replication  of  DNA  can  last
forever.  It  affects  every  descendant  every  time  the  altered  gene  is
expressed. Thus it makes sense for the mechanism of DNA synthesis to
have  evolved  to  be  highly  precise.  There  is  only  one  real  way  to  be
precise,  and that is to  check  for and  correct any  errors a  number of
times.  In  the  replication  of  DNA,  error  checking  of  an  incorporated
nucleotide could occur before the next nucleotide is incorporated, or
checking for errors could occur later. Apparently, checking and correct-
ing occurs at both times. In the case of bacteria, and at least in some
eukaryotes,  the  replication  machinery  itself  checks  for  errors  in  the
process of nucleotide incorporation, and an entirely separate machinery
detects  and  corrects  errors in DNA that  has  already  been  replicated.
Retroviruses like HIV  are  an interesting exception. These have  small

53

54  DNA Synthesis

genomes and they need a high spontaneous mutation rate in order to
evade their host’s immunological surveillance system.

Generally,  DNA  must  also  maintain  its  structure  against  environ-
mental assaults. Damage to the bases of either DNA strand could lead
to  incorrect  base-pairing upon  the  next round of  DNA  replication. A
number  of  enzymes  exist  for  recognizing,  removing,  and  replacing
damaged bases.

Since many cell types can grow at a variety of rates, sophisticated
mechanisms have developed to govern the initiation of DNA replication.
In both bacteria and eukaryotic cells, it is the initiation of replication
that is regulated, not the elongation. Although such a regulation system
seems difficult to coordinate with cell division, the alternative mecha-
nisms for regulating the rate of DNA synthesis are more complicated.
In principle, the DNA elongation rate could be adjusted by changing the
concentrations of many different substrates within the cell. This, how-
ever, would be most difficult because of the interconnected pathways
of nucleotide biosynthesis. Alternatively, the elongation rate of the DNA
polymerase itself could be variable. This too, would be most difficult to
manage and still maintain high fidelity of replication. Another problem
closely tied to DNA replication is the segregation of completed chromo-
somes  into  daughter  cells.  Not  surprisingly,  this  process  requires  a
complicated and specialized machinery.

In this chapter we begin with the process of DNA synthesis itself. After
examining the basic problems generated by the structure of DNA, we
discuss the enzymology of DNA synthesis. Then we mention the meth-
ods cells use to maximize the stability of information stored in DNA.
The second half of the chapter concerns physiological aspects of DNA
synthesis. Measurement of the number of functioning replication areas
per chromosome, the speed of DNA replication, and the coupling of cell
division to DNA replication are covered.

A. Enzymology

Proofreading, Okazaki Fragments, and DNA Ligase

As already discussed in Chapter 2, a single strand of DNA possesses a
polarity resulting from the asymmetric deoxyribose-3’-phosphate-5’-de-
oxyribose  bonds  along  the  backbone.  Most  DNA  found  in  cells  is
double-stranded;  a  second  strand  is  aligned  antiparallel  to  the  first
strand  and  possesses  a  sequence  complementary  to  the  first.  This
self-complementary  structure  solves  problems  in  replication  because

the product of replication is two daughter molecules, each identical to
one of its parents. As a result of the structural similarity between the
parent and daughter duplexes, the mechanisms necessary for readout
of the genetic information or replication of the DNA need not accom-
modate  multiple  structures.  Further,  the  redundancy  of  the  stored
information permits DNA with damage in one strand to be repaired by
reference to the sequence preserved in the undamaged, complementary
strand.

As is often the case in biology, numerous illustrative exceptions to the
generalizations  exist.  Single-stranded  DNA  phage  exist.  These  use  a
double-stranded form for intracellular replication but encapsidate only
one of the strands. Apparently, what they lose in repair abilities they
gain in nucleotides saved.

Generally, DNA is double-stranded, and both strands are replicated
almost  simultaneously  by  movement  of  a  replication  fork  down  the

DNA. In this case, the opposite polarities of the strands require that as
a replication fork moves down the DNA, overall, one daughter strand
grows in a 3’-to-5’ direction and the other daughter strand grows in a

5’-to-3’ direction. We shall see that the requirements of high speed and
high accuracy in the replication process complicates matters.

Although  cells  have  been  found  to  possess  5’-nucleoside  triphos-
phates  and  not  3’-nucleoside  triphosphates,  the  two  daughter  DNA
strands could be elongated nucleotide by nucleotide in both the 5’-to-3’,
and the 3’-to-5’ directions using just 5’-nucleoside molecules (Fig. 3.1).
This  latter  possibility  is  largely  excluded,  however,  by  the  need  for
proofreading to check the accuracy of the latest incorporated nucleo-
tide.

If  the  nucleotide  most  recently  incorporated  into  the  elongating
strand  does  not  correctly  pair  with  the  base  on  the  complementary
strand, the misincorporated nucleotide ought to be excised. Ultimately
such editing to remove a misincorporated base must generate a DNA
end precisely like the end that existed before addition of the incorrectly
paired  nucleotide.  Removal  of  the  final  nucleotide  from  the  strand
growing in the 5’-to-3’ direction immediately regenerates the 3’-OH that
is normally found at the end (Fig. 3.2). A strand growing in the 3’-to-5’
direction utilizing 5’ triphosphates will possess a triphosphate on its 5’
end. Simple excision of the final nucleotide from such a strand does not
regenerate the 5’ triphosphate end. Creation of the end normally seen
by the polymerase elongating such a strand would then require another
enzymatic  activity.  This,  in  turn,  would  require  dissociation  of  the
polymerase from the DNA and the entry of the other enzyme, a process
that would drastically slow the process of DNA elongation.

It is worthwhile examining why DNA polymerase must remain bound
to the complex of template strand and elongating strand through thou-
sands of elongation cycles. Such a processive behavior is essential since
elongation rates per growing chain must be hundreds of nucleotides per
second. If the polymerase dissociated with the addition of each nucleo-
tide, it would have to bind again for the next nucleotide, but even with
moderately high  concentrations of  polymerase, the binding rate of  a
protein to a site on DNA in cells is about one per second to one per 0.1
second, which is far below the necessary elongation rate. Consequently,
accurate DNA synthesis prohibits elongation in the 3’-to-5’ direction.

Figure 3.3  Nomenclature of the leading and lagging strands.

A variety of experiments show that both strands are synthesized at
replication  forks.  This  means  that  overall,  one  strand  grows  in  the
5’-to-3’ direction and the other in the 3’-to-5’ direction. One strand can
be synthesized continuously in the 5’-to-3’ direction. The other strand
cannot. It must grow in the 3’-to-5’ direction by the synthesis of short
segments which themselves are elongated in the 5’-to-3’ direction. These
are ligated together so that the net growth of this strand is 3’-to-5’ (Fig.
3.3). These fragments are called Okazaki fragments after their discov-
erer. The strand synthesized continuously is called the leading strand,
and the discontinuously synthesized strand is the lagging strand.

The above-mentioned considerations suggest that DNA polymerases
should  have  the  following  properties.  They  should  use  5’-nucleoside
triphosphates to elongate DNA strands in a 5’-to-3’ direction, and they
should  possess a 3’-to-5’ exonuclease activity to permit proofreading.
Additionally, cells should possess an enzyme to join the fragments of
DNA that are synthesized on the lagging strand. This enzyme is called
DNA ligase.

Detection and Basic Properties of DNA Polymerases

Use of a purified enzyme is one requirement for careful study of DNA
synthesis. In the early days of molecular biology, important experiments
by Kornberg demonstrated the existence in cell extracts of an enzyme
that could incorporate nucleoside triphosphates into a DNA chain. This
enzymatic  activity  could  be  purified from  bacterial extracts,  and  the
resultant enzyme was available for biochemical studies. Naturally, the
first question to be asked with such an enzyme was whether it utilized
a complementary DNA strand to direct the incorporation of the nucleo-
tides  into  the  elongating  strand  via  Watson-Crick  base-pairing  rules.
Fortunately the answer was yes. As this enzyme, DNA pol I, was more
carefully studied, however, some of its properties appeared to make it
unlikely that the enzyme synthesized the majority of the cellular DNA.
Cairns  tried  to  demonstrate  that  pol  I  was  not  the  key replication
enzyme by isolating a bacterial mutant lacking the enzyme. Of course,
if the mutant could not survive, his efforts would have yielded nothing.
Remarkably, however, he found a mutant with much less than normal

activity. Such a result appeared to prove that cells must possess other
DNA-synthesizing  enzymes,  but  until  a  mutant  could be found com-
pletely lacking DNA pol I, the demonstration was not complete.

Another  way  to  show the existence  of the DNA polymerases other
than DNA pol I is to detect and purify them biochemically. Previously
such attempts had proved futile because DNA pol I masked the presence
of other polymerases. Once Cairns’s mutant was available, however, it
was  a  matter  of  straightforward  biochemistry  to  examine  bacterial
extracts for the presence of additional DNA-polymerizing enzymes. Two
more such enzymes were found: DNA pol II and DNA pol III.

None of the three polymerases is capable of initiating DNA synthesis
on a template strand. They are able to elongate growing polynucleotide
chains, but they cannot initiate synthesis of a chain. This inability is not
surprising, however, because initiation must be carefully regulated and
could be expected to involve a number of other proteins that would not
be necessary for elongation. For initiation, all three polymerases require
the presence of a hydroxyl group in the correct position. The hydroxyl
group can derive from a short stretch of DNA or RNA annealed to one
strand, from cleavage of a DNA duplex, or even from a protein, in which
the hydroxyl utilized is on a serine or threonine residue (Fig. 3.4).

The Okazaki fragments from which the lagging strand is built have
been  found  to  be  initiated  by  a  short  stretch  of  RNA.  This  can  be
demonstrated by slowing elongation by growing cells at 14°. To maxi-
mize  the  fraction  of  radioactive  label  in  newly  synthesized  Okazaki
fragments,  the  DNA  is  labeled  with  radioactive  thymidine  for  only
fifteen seconds. Then it is extracted, denatured, and separated according
to density by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl. RNA is more dense
than DNA in such gradients, and the ten to fifteen ribonucleotides at the
end of the Okazaki fragments somewhat increase their density. Diges-
tion  with  RNAse  or  alkali  removes  the  RNA  and  the  density  of  the
fragments shifts to that of normal DNA. Therefore, one function of the

replication machinery is to lay down the RNA primers of the Okazaki
fragments. This activity is called primase.

In bacteria, DNA pol III is the main DNA replication enzyme. DNA
pol I fills in the gaps in lagging strand synthesis and assists during repair
of damaged DNA. No function is known for DNA pol II. Both DNA pol
I  and  DNA  pol  III  possess  the  3’-to-5’  exonuclease  activity  that  is
necessary for proofreading removal of misincorporated nucleotides.

DNA pol I also possesses a 5’-to-3’ exonuclease activity not found in
the other polymerases. This activity permits pol I to bind to a nick in
the DNA, remove the nucleotide on the 3’ side, incorporate a nucleotide
on  the  5’ side and  perform  this process  over and over  again without
dissociating from the DNA after each nucleotide. Thus pol I can proc-
essively translate a nick down the  DNA in  the 5’-to-3’ direction. This
process is used to remove the RNA that primes synthesis of the Okazaki
fragments (Fig. 3.5). When pol III reaches such a primer it dissociates
from the DNA. Then DNA pol I can bind and nick translate through the
stretch of RNA. DNA pol I is less processive than DNA pol III, so that
when pol I dissociates at some point after nick translating through the
RNA primer, the resulting DNA-DNA nick can be sealed by DNA ligase.
This ends  the elongation process for this Okazaki fragment.

The two exonuclease activities and the polymerizing activity of DNA
pol I reside on the single polypeptide chain of the enzyme. DNA pol III
is not so simple. Two slightly different forms of the enzyme appear to
function as a dimer, one which synthesizes the leading strand, and one
which synthesizes the lagging strand. Most likely the complete complex,
the holoenzyme, actually consists of at least nine different polypeptide
chains.  The  α  subunit  possesses  the  polymerizing  activity,  and  the ε
subunit contains the 3’-5’ exonuclease activity. The unit of α, ε, and θ
forms an active core that is capable of synthesizing short stretches of
DNA. Remaining associated with the template strand and being highly
processive is conferred by the complex of γ, δ, δ’, χ, and ψ which facilitate
the addition of a dimer of β. The dimer of β encircles the DNA and forces

60  DNA Synthesis

the complex to remain associated with the same DNA molecule through-
out the replication cycle.

Not surprisingly, eukaryotic cells also possess multiple DNA polym -
erases  which  contain  multiple  subunits.  These  polymerases,  not  the
subunits, often are named α, β, γ , δ, and ε. The α polymerase was long
thought to be the general polymerizing enzyme, with the small β enzyme
considered to be a repair enzyme. The γ enzyme is mitochondrial. We
now know that α is likely to initiate synthesis on both the leading and
lagging strands since only it possesses priming activity. Further elonga-
tion on the leading strand is performed by δ, and on the lagging strand
by ε or α. The β enzyme could complete the lagging strands by filling
the same role as is played by DNA pol I in bacteria.

In vitro DNA Replication

The mere incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into polymers of
DNA is far from the complete biological process of DNA replication. The
initial experiments seeking polymerization activities from cell extracts
used nicked and gapped DNA as a template. This yielded polymerases
capable of elongating DNA, but did not provide an assay for any of the
DNA initiating components. To seek the cellular machinery necessary
for initiating replication, DNA templates were required that contained
sequences specifying origins of replication. The most convenient source
of such origins was small DNA phages since each molecule must contain
an  origin.  The  results  of  experiments  with  several  different  phage
templates revealed the astounding fact that the proteins required for
initiating replication varied from one DNA origin to another. At first it
was not possible to discern the biochemical principles underlying initia-
tion  of  replication.  Therefore,  when  DNA  cloning  became  possible,
attention turned to a replication origin of greater generality and impor-
tance, the origin of replication of the E. coli chromosome. Later, when
it became possible to work with animal viruses and to isolate and study
replication origins from eukaryotic cells, these also were studied.

Kornberg and his collaborators were able to find conditions in which
a cell extract prepared from E. coli could replicate DNA from the E. coli
origin,  oriC.  Such  an  extract  undoubtedly  possessed  many  different
proteins  acting  in  concert  to  replicate  the  DNA.  Once  this  step  was
working,  it  was  then  possible  to  seek  to  identify  specific  proteins
involved in the reaction. Geneticists assisted this difficult step through
their  isolation  of  temperature-sensitive  mutations  that  blocked  DNA
synthesis in growing cells. For example, extracts prepared from cells
with  a  temperature-sensitive  dnaA  mutation  were  inactive.  This,  of
course, is a biochemist’s dream, for it provides a specific assay for the
DnaA protein. Extracts prepared from wild-type cells can supplement
extracts prepared from temperature-sensitive dnaA mutant cells. This
supplementation results from the wild-type DnaA protein in the wild-
type extract. Next, the wild-type extract can be fractionated and the in
vitro complementation assay detects which fraction contains the DnaA
protein. With such an assay the DnaA protein was purified.

The strategy used with the DnaA protein is straightforward, and it
can be used to purify proteins by making use of any replication mutant
whose cell extracts are inactive. The work required for this approach is
immense, and therefore it helps to try to guess proteins required for
replication and to add these as purified components. If the assay doesn’t
replicate DNA, cell extracts are added and the resulting activity can be
used to guide purification of the remaining components. Ultimately, the
following components were identified as necessary for in vitro replica-
tion  from  oriC:    DnaA  protein,  DnaB  protein,  DnaC  protein,  DnaG
protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, DNA gyrase, single-stranded
binding  protein,  and  ATP.  Analogous  experiments  using  replication
origins from animal viruses have also permitted the detection, purifica-
tion and study of the complete set of proteins necessary for their activity.
In vitro initiation and synthesis reactions have permitted the replica-
tion  process  at  the  E.  coli  oriC  to  be  dissected  into  several  steps.
Initiation begins with 20 to 40 molecules of DnaA protein binding to
four sites in the 260 base pair oriC region (Fig. 3.6). The complex of
DnaA and oriC contains the DNA wrapped around the outside and the
protein in the middle. The large number of protein molecules required

for the first step of initiation makes the step critically dependent on the
concentration of the protein. Such a step is ideal for tight regulation of
the initiation process. In the second step, DnaB plus DnaC bind. DnaB
possesses a helicase activity which separates the DNA strands with the
consumption of energy. DnaA binds to three additional sites in oriC and
several  regions  of  single-stranded  DNA  are  generated.  Finally,  DnaG
protein lays down RNA primers that are used by the pol III holoenzyme.
During  the elongation  process  the  single-stranded  binding  protein
SSB binds to single-stranded regions opened by the helicase activities
of  DnaB  (Fig.  3.7).  DNA  gyrase  also  is  required  for  elongation.  It
untwists the rotations that are generated ahead of the moving replica-
tion  fork.  In  vivo  the  twists  that  are  generated  behind  the  moving
replication fork are removed by topisomerase I.

Several other proteins are also involved with replication. The histone-
like  protein,  HU,  seems  to  assist  the  process,  but  its  mechanism  is
unknown. RNAse H digests the RNA from RNA-DNA hybrids left over
from transcription and prevents initiation from points other than the
origin.

Error and Damage Correction 

The bacterial DNA polymerases I and III, but not the eukaryotic DNA
polymerases,  as  they  are  commonly  purified,  possess  the  ability  to
correct mistakes immediately upon misincorporation of a nucleoside
triphosphate. The subunit of the eukaryotic DNA polymerases required
for this 3’-to-5’ exonuclease activity must be similar to the prokaryotic
error  correcting  unit,  but  is  less  tightly  bound  to  the  polymerizing
subunit.  We  know  this  because  adding  the  bacterial  protein  to  the
eukaryotic polymerase confers an error correcting 3’-to-5’ exonuclease
activity to the eukaryotic enzyme.

Cells also possess the ability to correct replication mistakes that have
eluded  the  editing  activity  of  the  polymerases.  Enzymes  recognize
mispaired bases and excise them. The gap thus produced is filled in by
DNA  polymerase  I,  or  in eukaryotic cells by  DNA polymerase β, and
sealed with DNA ligase. At first glance, such a repair mechanism would
not  seem  to  have  much  value.  Half  the  time  it  would  correct  the
nucleotide from the incorrect strand. How can the cell restrict its repair
to the newly synthesized strand? The answer is that DNA repair enzymes

distinguish old from new DNA strands with methyl groups.  Only after
a  newly  synthesized  strand  has  been  around  for  some  time  does  it
become methylated and thereby identified as “old.” By this means the
repair enzymes can tell which of the strands should be repaired. Since
the methyl groups involved are not densely spaced along the DNA, the
repair enzymes find the mispaired bases by binding at appropriate sites
and moving along the DNA to the mispaired base, all the while keeping
track of which strand is parental and which is the newly synthesized
daughter  that  should  be  corrected.  In  Escherichia  coli,  the  ages  of
strands are identified by the attachment of methyl groups to the ade-
nines of the sequence GATC.

At least one class of mismatched bases that may exist in Escherichia
coli following  DNA replication  is detected  by the MutS  protein. This
protein  binds  directly  to  the  mismatched  base  (Fig.  3.8).  Two  other
proteins of the Mut system, MutH and MutL, bind to the hemimethy-
lated GATC sequence. Apparently, MutH, MutL, and MutS then interact,
generating  a  nick  at  the  GATC  site  on the unmethylated  strand. The
unmethylated daughter strand is digested from this point and resynthe-
sized  by  nick  translation  past  the  mispaired  base,  thereby  correctly
repairing the original mismatch.

The  information  stored  in  the  DNA  can  also  be  compromised  by
damage that occurs subsequent to synthesis. For example, DNA can be
alkylated by chemicals in the environment. As a number of positions in
DNA may be alkylated, a number of proteins exist for removing these
groups. This class of repair system was discovered by the observation
that  prior  exposure  of  cells  to  low  concentrations  of  the  mutagen
nitrosoguanidine,  which  alkylates  DNA,  greatly  reduced  the  lethality
and mutagenicity caused by subsequent exposure to higher concentra-
tions of the agent. This shows that resistance was induced by the first
exposure.    Furthermore,  the  resistance  could  not  be  induced  in  the
presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, also showing that synthesis of
a protein had to be induced to provide resistance.

Additional investigation of the alkylation repair system has shown
that E. coli normally contains about 20 molecules of a protein that can
remove methyl groups from O6-methylguanine. The protein transfers
the methyl group from DNA to itself, thereby committing suicide, and
at the same time generating a conformational change so that the protein
induces  more  synthesis  of  itself.  The  methylated  protein  acts  as  a
transcription activator of the gene coding for itself. Another domain of
this same protein can transfer methyl groups from methyl phosphotri-
ester groups on the DNA. Additional proteins exist for removal of other
adducts.

Ultraviolet light can also damage DNA. One of the major chemical
products  of UV irradiation is cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formed
between  adjacent  pyrimidines,  for  example  between  thymine  and
thymine as shown in Fig. 3.9. These structures inhibit transcription and
replication  and  must  be  removed.  The  UvrA,  UvrB,  and  UvrC  gene
products perform this task in E. coli. In humans, defects in analogs of
these  enzymes  lead  to  a  condition  called  Xeroderma  pigmentosum,
which produces unusual sensitivity to sunlight.

The repair process for UV damaged DNA requires making nicks in
the damaged DNA strand flanking the lesion, removing the damaged
section, and repair synthesis to fill in the gap. Exposure to UV has long
been known to generate mutations. Although the repair process itself
could be inaccurate and generate the mutations, the actual situation is
a bit more complicated. It appears that the existence of the damaged
DNA turns off at least one of the normal error correction pathways. Thus
mutations accumulate, even in portions of chromosomes not damaged
by  irradiation,  if  somewhere  in  the  cell  there  exists  damaged  DNA.
Ordinarily, pol III utilizes its 3’-5’ exonuclease activity to correct mis-
paired bases, but RecA protein can turn off this repair activity. Appar -
ently,  RecA  protein  binds  to  a  damaged  site  in  the  DNA,  and  as
replication passes the point, the protein binds to the polymerase. The
bound RecA then inhibits the normal 3’-5’ exonuclease activity of the
enzyme. Perhaps the relaxation of the fidelity of pol III helps the enzyme
replicate past sites of UV damage. On the other hand, it is possible that
the  cell  merely  utilizes  the  opportunity  of  excessive  DNA  damage  to

increase its spontaneous mutation rate. Such a strategy of increasing
mutation rates during times  of stress would be of great evolutionary
value.  Recent  experiments  suggest  that  similar  increased  mutation
frequencies occur during times of nutrient starvation.

Simple chemical degradation can also compromise the information
stored in DNA. The amino group on cytosine is not absolutely stable.
Consequently, it can spontaneously deaminate to leave uracil (Fig. 3.10).
DNA replication past such a point would then convert the former G-C
base pair to an A-T base pair in one of the daughters because uracil has

the base-pairing properties of thymine. Enzymes exist to repair deami-
nated cytosine. The first enzyme of the pathway is a uracil-DNA glycosi-
dase  that  removes  the  uracil  base,  leaving  the  deoxyribose  and
phosphodiester  backbone.  Then  the  deoxyribose  is  removed  and  the
resulting gap in the phosphodiester backbone is filled in. The fact that
deaminated  cytosine  can  be  recognized  as  alien  may  be  the  reason
thymine  rather  than  uracil  is  used  in  DNA.  If  uracil  were  a  natural
component, cytosine deaminations could not be detected and corrected.
An  interesting  example  demonstrates  the  efficiency  of  the  deami-
nated cytosine repair system. As mentioned above, and as we examine
more  carefully  in  Chapter  10,  some  cells  methylate  bases  found  in
particular sequences. In E. coli one such sequence is CCAGG, which is
methylated on the second C. Should this cytosine deaminate, its extra
methyl  group  blocks  the  action  of  the  uracil-DNA  glycosidase.  As  a
result,  spontaneous  deamination at this  position cannot  be repaired.
Indeed,  this  nucleotide  has  been  found  to  be  at  least  ten  times  as
susceptible to spontaneous mutation as adjacent cytosine residues.

66  DNA Synthesis

B. Physiological Aspects

DNA Replication Areas In Chromosomes 

After  considering  the  enzymology  of  the  DNA  replication  and  repair
processes,  we  turn  to  more  biological  questions.  As  a  first  step,  it  is
useful to learn the number of DNA synthesis regions per bacterial or
eukaryotic chromosome. To see why this is important, consider the two
extremes. On one hand, a chromosome could be duplicated by a single
replication fork  traversing the entire stretch of a DNA molecule. On the
other hand, many replication points per chromosome could function
simultaneously. The requisite elongation rates and regulation mecha-
nisms would be vastly different in the two extremes. Furthermore, if
many replication points functioned simultaneously, they could be either
scattered over the chromosome or concentrated into localized replica-
tion regions.

The  most  straightforward  method  for  determining  the  number  of
replication regions on a chromosome is electron microscopy. This is
possible for smaller bacteriophage or viruses, but the total amount of
DNA  contained  in  a  bacterial  chromosome  is  far  too  great  to  allow
detection of the few replication regions that might exist. The situation
is even worse for chromosomes from eukaryotes because they contain
as much as one hundred times the amount of DNA per chromosome as
bacteria. The solution to this problem is not to look at all the DNA but
to look at just the DNA that has been replicated in the previous minute.
This  can  easily  be  done  by  autoradiography.  Cells  are  administered
highly radioactive thymidine, and a minute later the DNA is extracted
and gently spread on photographic film to expose a trail which, upon
development, displays the stretches of DNA that were synthesized in the
presence of the radioactivity.

The results of such autoradiographic experiments show that cultured
mammalian cells contain DNA synthesis origins about every 40,000 to
200,000 base pairs along the DNA. In bacteria, the result was different;

ration.

Bidirectional Replication from E. coli Origins   67

administration of a short pulse of radioactive thymidine was unneces-
sary. When thymidine was provided for more than one doubling time,
the  entire  chromosome  of  the  bacterium  could  be  visualized  via  the
exposed photographic grains. Two startling facts were seen: the chro-
mosome  was  circular,  and  it  possessed  only  one  or  two  replication
regions (Fig. 3.11).

The existence of a  circular DNA molecule containing an additional
segment of the circle connecting two points, the  theta form, was inter-
preted as showing that the chromosome was replicated from an origin
by one replication region that proceeded around the circular chromo-
some. It could also have been interpreted as demonstrating the existence
of two replication regions that proceeded outward in both directions
from a replication origin. Some of the original autoradiographs pub-
lished by Cairns contain suggestions that the DNA is replicated in both
directions from an origin. This clue that replication is bidirectional was
overlooked until the genetic data of Masters and Broda provided solid
and convincing data for two replication regions in the E. coli chromo-
some.

Bidirectional Replication from E. coli Origins 

The Masters and Broda experiment was designed to locate the origin of
replication on the genetic map. It is primarily a genetic experiment, but
it utilizes the fact discussed in the first chapter that an exponentially
growing population contains more young individuals than old individu-
als. Chromosomes can be considered in the same way. Correspondingly,
a  population  of  growing  and  dividing  chromosomes  contains  more
members just beginning replication than members just finishing repli-
cation. The Cairns autoradiograph experiments show that the chromo-

some is replicated sequentially. A population of cells or chromosomes
that is growing exponentially will contain more copies of genes located
near  the  origin  of  replication  than  genes  located  at  the  terminus  of
replication. This same idea was used to locate the replication origin and
demonstrate bidirectional replication of the SV40 animal virus.

Determining whether the bacterial chromosome is replicated in one
direction from a unique origin or in both directions from a unique origin
becomes  a  question  of  counting  gene  copies.  If  we  could  count  the
number of copies of genes A, B, C, D, and E, we could determine whether
the cell uses monodirectional or bidirectional DNA replication initiating
from point X (Fig. 3.12).

Several methods exist for counting the relative numbers of copies of
different genes or chromosome regions. Here we shall consider a bio-
logical method for performing such counting that utilizes the phage P1.
This  method  depends  upon  the  fact  that  after  P1  infection,  a  cell
synthesizes about 100 new P1 particles. Most of these package their own
DNA. A few phage particles package E. coli DNA instead. If a P1 lysate
that was prepared on one type of cells is then used to infect a second
culture  of  cells,  most  of  the  infected  cells  will  proceed  to  make  new
phage P1. Those few cells that are infected with a P1 coat containing E.
coli DNA from the first cells may be able to recombine that particular
stretch of E. coli DNA into their chromosomes. By this means they can
replace  stretches  of  chromosomal  DNA  with  chromosomal  DNA
brought  into them  by  the  phage  particles (Fig.  3.13).  This process  is
termed transduction.

The  numbers  of  these  defective  phage  particles  carrying  different
genes from the infected cells is related to the numbers of copies of these
genes present at the time of phage infection. Transduced cells can be
made to reveal themselves as colonies, thereby permitting their simple
and accurate quantitation. Consequently the use of phage P1 enabled
counting  of  the  relative  numbers  of  copies  within  growing  cells  of
various  genes  located  around  the  chromosome.  The  results  together
with the known genetic map indicated that E. coli replicates its chro-
mosome  bidirectionally  and  determined  the  genetic  location  of  the
replication origin.

Granules from DNA synthesized in

Figure 3.14  Schematic of an electron micrograph of an autoradiograph pre-
pared from mouse DNA extracted after 30 seconds of labeling with radioactive
thymidine. DNA is replicated bidirectionally from the multiple origins.

On  the  opposite  side  of  the  chromosome  from  the  origin  lies  a
terminus region. A protein called Tus binds to the terminus. It blocks
elongation by inactivating the oncoming helicase of the replication fork.
Autoradiographic experiments have also suggested that mammalian
DNA  also replicates  bidirectionally from origins (Fig.  3.14).  Multiple
replication forks or “eyes” could be shown to derive from a single DNA
duplex. The replication trails indicated that two forks originated from
a single origin. Furthermore, the rate of elongation of labeled strands
showed that the synthesis rate of mammalian DNA is about 200 nucleo-
tides per second.

The DNA Elongation Rate

It seems reasonable that half the single bacterial chromosome should
be replicated by a single replication region traversing the chromosome
in about one doubling time. If such a replication region does not contain
multiple points of DNA elongation, then the speed of DNA chain elon-
gation must be on the order of 1,000 nucleotides per second to replicate
the chromosome’s 3 × 106 bases in a typical doubling time for rapidly
growing bacteria of 30 minutes. Measuring such a rate is very difficult,
but fortunately it is possible to reduce its value by about a factor of 5 by
growing the cells at 20° instead of 37°, the temperature of most rapid
growth.

If radioactive DNA precursors are added to the cell growth medium
and growth is stopped soon thereafter, the total amount of radioactivity,
T, incorporated into DNA equals the product of four factors: a constant
related to the specific activity of the label, the number of growing chains,
the  elongation  rate  of  a  chain,  and  the  time  of  radioactive  labeling
T = c × N × R × t. Similarly, the total amount of radioactivity incorpo-
rated into the ends of elongating chains, E,  equals the product of two

Determination of the T radioactivity is straightforward, but determi-
nation of the end radioactivity is not so obvious. Furthermore, careful
experimentation would be required so that losses from either T or E
samples  do  not  introduce  errors.  These  problems  can  be  solved  by
digesting the DNA extracted from the labeled cells with a nuclease that
cleaves so as to leave a phosphate on the 3’ position of the deoxyribose.
After the digestion, the terminal deoxyribose from the elongating chain
lacks a phosphate, whereas the internal deoxyriboses all possess phos-
phate  groups  (Fig.  3.15).  Hence  separation  and  quantitation  of  the
radioactive  nucleosides  and  nucleotides  in  a  single  sample  prepared
from cells following a short administration of the four radioactive DNA
precursors yield the desired T and E values.

If the elongation rate is several hundred bases per second, then one
second of synthesis will label several hundred bases, and a separation
of nucleosides and nucleotides will then need to be better than one part
in several hundred. Also, it is difficult to add label suddenly and then to
stop  the  cells’  DNA  synthesis  quickly.  Finally,  the  specific  activity  of
intracellular nucleoside triphosphate pools does not immediately jump
to the same specific activity as the label added to the medium. Fortu-
nately the effect of a changing specific activity can be simply accounted
for by taking a series of samples for analysis at different times after the
addition of radioactive label.

The sample from the first point that could be taken from the cells
after the addition of radioactive label possessed little radioactivity. It
had  counts  of  17-20  cpm  in  ends  and  2-20  ×  105  cpm  in  total  DNA.
Samples taken later possessed greater  amounts  of radioactivity. This
experiment yielded elongation rates of 140-250 bases/sec in cells with a

Constancy of the E. coli DNA Elongation Rate  71

doubling time of 150 minutes. This corresponds to a rate of 400 to 800
bases/sec in cells growing at 37° with a doubling time of 45 minutes.
Therefore, only about two elongation points exist per replication region.
The effects on this type of measurement of discontinuous DNA replica-
tion on the lagging strand are left as a problem for the reader.

The primary conclusion that should be drawn from the direct meas-
urement of the DNA elongation rate is that a small number of enzyme
molecules are involved. The cell does not utilize an extensive factory
with many active DNA polymerase molecules in a growing region. What
happens when cells grow at 37° but at different growth rates due to the
presence of different growth media? 

Constancy of the E. coli DNA Elongation Rate

Determining  the  strategy  that  cells  use  to  adjust  DNA  replication  to
different growth rates once again utilizes measurement of the numbers
of gene copies. Consider two cell types, one with a doubling time of 1
hour and one with a doubling time of 2 hours. If each cell type requires
the full doubling time to replicate its chromosome, then the distribu-
tions of structures of replicating chromosomes extracted from random
populations of cells growing at the two different rates would be identical
(Fig. 3.16.). However, if both cell types replicate their chromosomes in
1  hour,  then  the  cells  with  the  1-hour  doubling  time  will  possess  a
different distribution of chromosome structures than the cells with the
2-hour doubling time (Fig. 3.17). The problem, once again, is that of
counting  copies  of  genes.  Measuring  the  number  of  copies  of  genes
located  near  the  origin  and  of  genes  located  near  the  terminus  of
replication permits these two possible DNA replication schemes to be
distinguished.

Instead  of  measuring  numbers  of  copies of genes by  transduction
frequencies, the more precise method of DNA hybridization could be
used because the locations of the origin and terminus were known. DNA

was  extracted  from  the  cells,  denatured,  and  immobilized  on  filter
paper. Then an excess of a mixture of 3H-labeled DNA fragment from
the origin and 14C-labeled DNA fragment from the terminus region was
added and allowed to hybridize to the single-stranded DNA on the filters.
When  all  hybridization  to  the  immobilized  DNA  was  completed,  the
filters were washed free of unannealed DNA and the ratio of bound 3H
to 14C radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. This
ratio reflects the ratio of the number of origins and termini in the culture
of cells from which the DNA was extracted. The ratio could be measured
using  DNA  extracted  from  cells  growing  at  various  growth  rates.  It
showed that for cell doubling times in the range of 20 minutes to 3 hours
the chromosome doubling time remained constant at about 40 minutes.
The constancy of the chromosome doubling time raises new prob-
lems, however. How do the cells manage to keep DNA replication and
cell division precisely coordinated, and how can DNA replication, which
requires 40 minutes, manage to keep up with cell division if cells are
dividing in less than 40 minutes? 

Regulating Initiations 

Helmstetter and Cooper have provided an explanation for the problem
of  maintaining  a  strain  of  Escherichia  coli  cells  in  balanced  growth
despite a difference between the cellular division time and the chromo-
some replication time. Even though other strains and organisms may
differ in the details of their regulation mechanisms, the model is of great
value because it summarizes a large body of data and provides a clear
understanding of ways in which cell division and DNA replication can
be kept in step.

The model applies most closely to cells growing with a doubling time
less than 1 hour. One statement of the model is that a cell will divide  I
+ C + D minutes after the start of synthesis of an initiator substance,
which is DnaA protein itself. I can be thought of as the time required
for the I protein to accumulate to a level such that replication can initiate
on all origins present in the cell. In our discussions, we will call this
critical  level  1.  That  is,  when  a  full  unit  of  I  has  accumulated,  all
chromosomes present in the cell initiate replication, a round of replica-

tions begins, and the I substance present at this time is consumed so
that its accumulation begins again from a value of zero.

C is the time required for complete synthesis of the chromosome. It
is independent of the growth rate of the cells as long as they grow at 37°,
and it has a value of 40 minutes. D is a constant equal to 20 minutes.
This is the time following completion of a round of DNA synthesis until
the cell divides. It should be emphasized that in this model a cell must
divide D minutes after completion of a round of DNA replication. D can
be considered to be the time required for segregation of the daughter
chromosomes  into  opposite  ends  of  the  cell  and  for  growth  of  the
septum that separates the cells.

The only parameter in the model that is responsive to the growth rate
of the cells is the rate at which I accumulates. If the growth rate doubles
as a result of a richer nutrient medium, the rate of accumulation of I
doubles. The time required for accumulation of a full unit of I is the
doubling time of the cells.

To illustrate the model, we will consider cells growing with a doubling
time of 20 minutes (Fig. 3.18). For convenience, consider the bidirec-
tional replication of the cell’s circular chromosome to be abstracted to
a forked line. We use a dot to represent the replication fork, and we
encircle the chromosome to represent cell division. Since the model is
stable, analysis of a cell division cycle can begin from a point not in a
normal division cycle, and continued application of the model’s rules
should ultimately yield the states of cells growing with the appropriate
doubling times.

We begin in Fig. 3.18 from a point at which replication of a chromo-
some has just begun and the value of I is zero. After 10 minutes, the

74  DNA Synthesis

chromosome  is  one-quarter  replicated,  and  I=1⁄2.  At  20,  40,  and  60
minutes after the start of replication, full units of 1 have accumulated,
new rounds of replication begin from all the origins present, and the
chromosomes become multiforked. The first cell division can occur at
60 minutes after the start of replication, and divisions occur at 20-min-
ute intervals thereafter. The DNA configuration and quantity of I present
in  cells just  after  division at 60 minutes is the same as in cells at 40
minutes. Therefore the cell cycle in this medium begins at 40 minutes
and ends at 60 minutes. This means that zero-age cells in this medium
possess two half-replicated chromosomes.

How can the multiple origins which exist within rapidly growing cells
all initiate at precisely the same instant, or do they initiate at the same
instant? A related question is what keeps an origin of replication from
being reused immediately after it has initiated a round of synthesis? The
answer is known in general terms, and could well apply to the analogous
problems in eukaryotic cells. We know that a sizeable number of DnaA
protein molecules are required to initiate replication from an origin.
This  large  number makes  the  reaction  critically  dependent  upon  the
concentration of DnaA.  When it is a little too low, there is a very low
probability of initiation, but the moment the critical concentration is
reached, initiation can occur. Then, to keep the origin from being used
again, it is promptly buried in the membrane. The signal for burying is
that it be half methylated. Before initiation, both strands of the origin
are methylated on the multiple GATC sequences contained in bacterial
origins. After initiation, the new daughter strand is not methylated, and
the  hemimethylated  DNA  is  bound  to  the  membrane  and  therefore
inaccessible to the initiation machinery. On a time scale of ten minutes
or so, the newly synthesized strand becomes methylated and the origin
is  released  from the  membrane.  In the  meantime, either  the  level  of
DnaA or some other critical component has been reduced, and the origin
is in no danger of firing again until the proper time.

Gel Electrophoresis Assay of Eukaryotic Replication Origins

It has been possible to construct artificial yeast chromosomes by com-
bining isolated centromeres, telomeres, and autonomously replicating
sequences known as ARS sequences. Although ARS sequences function
in the artificial chromosomes, it is interesting to know whether they also
normally function as origins. A gel electrophoresis technique based on
the Southern transfer technology as described in the previous chapter
permits examination of this question.

Experiments  have  shown  that  ordinarily  gel  electrophoresis  sepa-
rates  DNA  according  to  molecular  weight.  If,  however,  the  voltage
gradient is increased five-fold above normal to about 5 V/cm, and higher
than normal concentrations of agarose are used, then the separation
becomes largely based on shape of the DNA molecules rather than their
total molecular weight. Normal electrophoresis and this shape-sensitive
electrophoresis can be combined in a two dimensional electrophoretic
separation technique that is particularly useful in the analysis of repli-

cation origins. The DNA fragments necessary for the analysis are gen-
erated by cleaving DNA extracted from cells with restriction enzymes.
These cut at specific sequences, and will be discussed more extensively
in a later chapter. A DNA sample obtained by cutting chromosomal DNA
with such a restriction enzyme is first separated according to size by
electrophoresis in one direction. Then it is separated according to shape
by electrophoresis in a direction perpendicular to the first.  After the
electrophoresis, the locations of the fragments containing the sequence
in question are determined by Southern transfer.

Let us first consider the two-dimensional electrophoretic pattern of
DNA fragments that would be generated from DNA extracted from a
large number of growing cells if replication origins were to enter a 1000
base pair region from the left (Fig. 3.19). In the majority of the cells no
replication origin will be on the 1000 base pair stretch of DNA. There-

fore, after cutting with the restriction enzyme these stretches will be
simple 1000 base pair pieces of DNA. After the Southern transfer, these
molecules will show up as a spot at 1000 base pairs. Some of the cells
would contain  replication  origins in  the 1000  base  pair region. After
cutting  with  the  restriction  enzyme,  these  molecules  not  only  would
possess a mass larger than the 1000 base pair molecules, but also they
would be more asymmetric. The extreme of asymmetry would occur in
those molecules in which the replication origin was 500 base pairs from
the  end.  These  would  generate  the  peak  shown  in  Fig.  3.19.  Those
molecules for which the replication origin was nearly at the right end
would, again, be like simple DNA molecules, but molecules 2000 base
pairs long. Thus, the collection of molecular species would generate the
arc shown upon two dimensional electrophoresis. 

If the region of DNA we are considering contains a replication origin,
quite a different pattern is generated. Suppose the origin is exactly in
the  middle  of  the  region.  Then  the  various  replication  forms  are  as
shown in Fig. 3.20 and the pattern that will be found after Southern
transfer is as shown. It is left as a problem to deduce the pattern expected
if the origin is located to one side of the center of the DNA segment.

How Fast Could DNA Be Replicated?

In the preceding sections we have seen that the bacterial chromosome
is  replicated  by  two  synthesis  forks  moving  away  from  a  replication
origin at a chain elongation speed of about 500 nucleotides per second
for cells growing at 37°. How does this rate compare to the maximum
rate at which nucleotides could diffuse to the DNA polymerase? This
question is one specific example of a general concern about intracellular
conditions. Often it is important to know an approximate time required
for a particular molecule to diffuse to a site.

Consider  a  polymerase  molecule  to  be  sitting  in  a  sea  of  infinite
dimensions  containing  the  substrate.  Even  though  the  polymerase
moves along the DNA as it synthesizes, we will consider it to be at rest
since the processes of diffusion of the nucleotides which we are consid-
ering here are much faster. We will consider that the elongation rate of
the enzyme is limited by the diffusion of nucleotides to its active site.
Under these conditions, the concentration of substrate is zero on the
surface of a sphere of radius r0 constituting the active site of the enzyme
(Fig. 3.21). Any substrate molecules crossing the surface into this region
disappear.  At  great  distances  from  the  enzyme,  the  concentration  of
substrate remains unaltered. These represent the boundary conditions
of the situation, which requires a mathematical formulation to deter-
mine the concentrations at intermediate positions.

The basic diffusion equation relates time and position changes in the
concentration C of a diffusible quantity. As diffusion to an enzyme can
be considered to be spherically symmetric, the diffusion equation can
be written and solved in spherical coordinates involving only the radius
r, the concentration C, the diffusion coefficient D, and time t:

The solution to this equation, which satisfies the conditions of being
constant at large r and zero at r = r0, is 

C(r)  =  C0(1   − 

).

The flow rate J of substrate to the enzyme can now be calculated from
the equation, giving the flux J: 

J  =  −D

.

 The total flow through a sphere centered on the enzyme yields 

F l o w   = 
= 

  4 πr2 J
  4 πDr0C0 .

The final result shows that the flow is independent of the size of the
sphere chosen for the calculation. This is as it should be. The only place
where material is being destroyed is at the active site of the enzyme.
Everywhere else, matter must be conserved. In steady state there is no
change of the concentration of substrate at any position, and hence the
net amount flowing through the surface of all spheres must be equal.

To calculate  the  flow  rate of nucleoside triphosphates  to the DNA
polymerase,  we  must  insert  numerical values in  the  final  result. The
concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in cells is between 1
mM and 0.1 mM. We will use 0.1 mM, which is 10-4 moles per liter or
10-7 moles per cm3. Taking the diffusion constant to be 10-7 cm2/sec and
r0 to be 10 Å, we find that the flow is 10-20 moles/sec or about 6,000
molecules/sec. The rate of DNA synthesis per enzyme molecule of about
500 nucleoside triphosphates per second is less than 10% of the upper
limit on the elongation rate set by the laws of diffusion. Considering that
the actual active site for certain capture of the triphosphate might be

high.

how the DNA polymerase I mutant in E. coli was found.

3.3. Design a substrate that would be useful in assaying the editing

3.4.  What  would  you  say  about  a  claim  that  the  only  effect  of  a

reduced the spontaneous mutation frequency?

performed  to  demonstrate  bidirectional  replication  of  the  chromo-
some?

3.6. Masters and Broda, Nature New Biol. 232, 137 (1970), report that
the normalization of gene transduction frequency by P1 is unnecessary;
in fact, the raw data support their conclusions better than the normal -

experiment could test your proposal? 

3.7.  Cells  that  have  been  growing  for  many  generations  with  a

starvations as a result of this shift. Sketch the DNA configurations and

time of the shift was 0 minutes and 10 minutes. Continue the analysis
until cells have fully adapted to growth at the slower growth rate.

interfere with a Manor-Deutscher measurement as DNA labeling times
become short? 

3.11. In the chromosome replication time measurements of Chan-
dler,  Bird,  and  Caro,  a  constant  replication  time  of  40  minutes  was
found. Does their result depend on when in the cell cycle this 40 minutes

3.12. An exponentially growing population was used to start a syn-
chrony experiment. After loosely bound cells have been washed off the

experiment, the concentration of cells in the eluate is found to oscillate
for several cycles with a period about equal to the cell doubling time.
What is the explanation for this oscillation? You should assume that the
probability that a cell initially binds to the filter is independent of its
age.

RNA Polymerase and
RNA Initiation

4

The previous two chapters discussed DNA and RNA structures and the
synthesis of DNA. In this chapter we consider RNA polymerase and the
initiation of transcription. The next chapter considers elongation, ter-
mination, and the processing of RNA.

Cells must synthesize several types of RNA in addition to the thou-
sands of different messenger RNAs that carry information to the ribo-
somes  for  translation  into  protein.  The  protein  synthesis  machinery
requires tRNA, the two large ribosomal RNAs, and the small ribosomal
RNA. Additionally, eukaryotic cells contain at least eight different small
RNAs found in the nucleus. Because these contain protein also, they are
called small ribonucleoprotein particles, snRNPs.  Eukaryotic cells use
three  types  of  RNA  polymerase  to  synthesize  the  different  classes  of
RNA, whereas E. coli uses only one. All these polymerases, however, are
closely related.

Experiments first done with bacteria and then with eukaryotic cells
have shown that the basic transcription cycle consists of the following:
binding  of  an  RNA  polymerase  molecule  at  a  special  site  called  a
promoter,  initiation  of  transcription,  further  elongation,  and  finally
termination and release of RNA polymerase. Although the definition of
promoter has varied somewhat over the years, we will use the term to
mean the nucleotides to which the RNA polymerase binds as well as any
others that are necessary for the initiation of transcription. It does not
include disconnected regulatory sequences which are discussed below,
that may lie hundreds or thousands of nucleotides away.

Promoters from different prokaryotic genes differ from one another
in nucleotide sequence, in the details of their functioning, and in their
overall activities. The same is true of eukaryotic promoters. On some

85

86  RNA Polymerase and RNA Initiation

prokaryotic promoters, RNA polymerase by itself is able to bind and
initiate transcription. In eukaryotic cells, the analog of such an unregu-
lated system is a promoter that requires no auxiliary proteins bound to
sites separated from the promoter. On many promoters, RNA polym-
erase  requires  the  assistance  of  one  or  more  auxiliary  proteins  for
binding, to displace histones, or for the initiation of transcription. That
other  proteins  should  be  involved  is  logical  as  the  activities  of  some
promoters have to be regulated in response to changing conditions in
the cell or in the growth medium. These auxiliary proteins sense these
conditions and appropriately modulate the activity of RNA polymerase
in initiating from some promoters. Occasionally, the regulated step is
after  initiation.  Part  of  this  chapter  discusses  measurements  of  the
differences  between  promoters  because  this  information  ultimately
should assist learning the functions of these auxiliary proteins.

Measuring the Activity of RNA Polymerase 

Studies  on  protein  synthesis  in  E.  coli  in  the  1960s  revealed  that  a
transient  RNA  copy  of  DNA  is  sent  to  ribosomes  to  direct  protein
synthesis. Therefore cells had to contain an RNA polymerase that was
capable of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template. This property was
sufficient to permit enzymologists to devise assays for detection of the
enzyme in crude extracts of cells.

The original assay of RNA polymerase was merely a measurement of
the amount of RNA synthesized in vitro. The RNA synthesized was easily
determined by measuring the incorporation of a radioactive RNA pre-
cursor,  usually  ATP,  into  a  polymer  (Fig.  4.1).  After  synthesis,  the
radioactive polymer was separated from the radioactive precursor nu-
cleotides by precipitation of the polymer with acid, and the radioactivity
in the polymer was determined with a Geiger counter.

The precipitation procedure measures total incorporated radioactiv-
ity. It is adequate for the assay of RNA polymerase activity and can be
used to guide steps in the purification of the enzyme, but it is indiscrimi-

After transcription, radioactive RNA and radioactive nucleotides remain. These

nate. Only the total amount of RNA synthesized in the reaction tube is
quantitated. Since many of the convenient DNA templates contain more
than one promoter and since in vitro transcription frequently initiates
from random locations on the DNA in addition to initiating from the
promoters,  a  higher-resolution  assay  of  transcription  is  required  to
study specific promoters and the proteins that control their activities.
Several basic methods are used to quantitate the activities of specific
promoters.  One  is  to  use  DNA  that  contains  several  promoters  and
specifically fish out and quantitate just the RNA of interest by RNA-DNA
hybridization (Fig. 4.2). Run-off transcription is another method that is
often used  for examining the activity of  promoters. This permits  the
simultaneous  assay  of  several  promoters  as  well  as  nonspecific  tran-
scription. Small pieces of DNA 200 to 2,000 base pairs long and contain-

ing the promoter in question can be isolated. Transcription initiating
from  the  promoter  on  these  templates  begins  at  the  promoter  and
usually extends to the end of the DNA. This produces a small transcript
of a unique size. Transcription initiating from other sites on the DNA
generates other sizes of RNA transcripts. The resultant RNA molecules,
whose sizes vary from 10 to 1,000 nucleotides, may easily be separated
from  one  another  by  electrophoresis  in  polyacrylamide  gels  in  the
presence  of  high  concentrations  of  urea  (Fig.  4.3).  These  denaturing
agents reduce the formation of transient hairpins in the RNA resulting
from  partial  complementarity  between  portions  of  the  molecules.
Therefore the RNA polymers migrate at velocities dependent on their
length  and  independent  of  their  sequences.  If  α-32PO4  triphosphates
have been used during the transcription, the locations of RNA molecules
in the gel can subsequently be determined by autoradiography.

The third basic approach for examining the activity of a particular
promoter became possible through improvements in recombinant DNA
technology. Small DNA fragments several hundred nucleotides long can
be isolated and used as templates in transcription assays. Quantitation
of the total RNA synthesized in these reactions permits assay of a single
promoter  since  the  small  DNA  templates  usually  contain  only  one
promoter.

Assaying transcription from an in vitro reaction is relatively easy if
purified proteins can be used. Obtaining the purified proteins is not so
easy,  however,  since  often  their  very  purification  requires  assaying
crude extracts for the transcriptional activity. The presence of nucleo-
tides in the extracts precludes radioactive labeling of the RNA synthe-
sized  in  vitro.  Therefore  an  assay  is  required  that  can  utilize
nonradioactive RNA. Primer extension meets the requirements for such
an assay (Fig. 4.4). RNA that was initiated in vitro and which transcribed

of  the DNA.  This  RNA  is  hybridized to  a  short  DNA fragment. Then
reverse transcriptase, an enzyme utilized by RNA viruses to make DNA
copies  of  themselves,  and  radioactive  deoxynucleotide  triphosphates
are added. The reverse transcriptase synthesizes a radioactive DNA copy
of the RNA. This can be separated from extraneous and nonspecific DNA
fragments by electrophoresis and be quantitated by autoradiography.

Concentration of Free RNA Polymerase in Cells

It  is  necessary  to  know  the  concentration  of  free  intracellular  RNA
polymerase  to  design  meaningful  in  vitro  transcription  experiments.
One method of determining the concentration utilizes the fact that the
β and β’ subunits of the E. coli RNA polymerase are larger than most
other polypeptides in the cell. This permits them to be easily separated
from other cellular proteins by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Consequently, after such electrophoresis, the amount of protein in the
β and β’ bands is compared to the total amount of protein on the gel.
The results are that a bacterial cell contains about 3,000 molecules of
RNA  polymerase.  A  calculation  using  the  cell  doubling  time  and
amounts of messenger RNA, tRNA, and ribosomal RNA in a cell leads
to the conclusion that about 1,500 RNA molecules are being synthesized
at  any  instant.  Hence  half  the  cell’s  RNA  polymerase  molecules  are
synthesizing RNA. Of the other 1,500 RNA polymerase molecules, fewer
than 300 are free of DNA and are able to diffuse through the cytoplasm.
The remainder are temporarily bound to DNA at nonpromoter sites.

How  do  we  know  these  numbers?  On  first  consideration,  a  direct
physical measurement showing that 300 RNA polymerase molecules are
free in the cytoplasm seems impossible. The existence, however, of a
special cell division mutant of E. coli makes this measurement straight-
forward (Fig. 4.5). About once per normal division, these mutant cells
divide near the end of the cell and produce a minicell that lacks DNA.
This cell contains a sample of the cytoplasm present in normal cells.
Hence, to determine the concentration of RNA polymerase free of DNA
in cells, it is necessary only to determine the concentration of ββ’ in the
DNA-less minicells. Such measurements show that the ratio of ββ’ to
total  protein  has  a value  in minicells of one-sixth the value found in

Figure 4.5  The generation of a minicell lacking a chromosome.

whole cells. Thus, at any instant, less than 20% of the RNA polymerase
in a cell is free within the cytoplasm.

The RNA Polymerase in Escherichia coli

Once biochemists could assay and purify an RNA polymerase from E.
coli, it was important to know the biological role of the enzyme. For
example, the bacterial cell might possess three different kinds of RNA
polymerase:  one  for  the  synthesis  of  messenger  RNA,  one  for  the
synthesis of tRNA, and one for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. If that
were the case, much effort could have been wasted in studying in vitro
transcription from a gene if the wrong RNA polymerase had been used.
Enzymologists’ failures to find more than one type of RNA polymerase
in E. coli were no proof that more did not exist, for, as we have seen in
Chapter  3,  detection  of  an  enzyme  in  cells  can  be  difficult.  In  other
words, what can be done to determine the biological role of the enzyme
that can be detected and purified?

Fortunately, a way of determining the role of the E. coli RNA polym-
erase finally appeared. It was in the form of a very useful antibiotic,
rifamycin, which blocks bacterial cell growth by inhibiting transcription
initiation by RNA polymerase. If many cells are spread on agar medium
containing rifamycin, most do not grow. A few do, and these rifamycin-
resistant mutants grow into colonies. Such mutants exist in populations
of  sensitive  cells  at  a  frequency  of  about  10-7.  Examination  of  the
resistant mutants shows them to be of two classes. Mutants of the first
class  are  resistant  because  their  cell  membrane  is  less  permeable  to
rifamycin than the membrane in wild-type cells. These are of no interest
to  us  here.  Mutants  of  the  second  class  are  resistant  by  virtue  of  an
alteration in the RNA polymerase. This can be demonstrated by the fact
that the RNA polymerase purified from such rifamycin-resistant cells
has become resistant to rifamycin.

Since  rifamycin-resistant  cells  now  contain  a  rifamycin-resistant
polymerase, it would seem that this polymerase must be the only type
present in cells. Such need not be the case, however. Consider first the
hypothetical possibility that cells contain two types of RNA polymerase,
one that is naturally sensitive to rifamycin, and one that is naturally
resistant. We might be purifying and studying the first enzyme when we
should be studying the naturally resistant polymerase. This possibility
of this situation can be excluded by showing that rifamycin addition to
cells stops all RNA synthesis. Therefore cells cannot contain a polym-
erase that is naturally resistant to rifamycin. A second possibility is that
cells contain two types of polymerase and both are sensitive to rifamy-
cin. Because mutants resistant to rifamycin can be isolated, both types
of polymerase would then have to be mutated to rifamycin resistance.
Such  an  event  is  exceedingly  unlikely,  however.  The  probability  of
mutating both polymerases is the product of the probability of mutating
either one. From other studies we know that the mutation frequency for
such an alteration in an enzyme is on the other of 10-7. Therefore, the
probability of mutating two polymerases to rifamycin resistance would

be about (10-7)2 (Fig. 4.6), which is far below the frequency of 10-7 that
is actually observed.

Thus far, then, we know these facts: The target of rifamycin is a single
type of RNA polymerase in bacteria. This RNA polymerase synthesizes
at least one essential class of RNA, and this polymerase is the one that
biochemists purify. How do we know that this RNA polymerase synthe-
sizes all the RNAs? Careful physiological experiments show that rifamy-
cin addition stops synthesis of all classes of RNA, mRNA, tRNA, and
rRNA. Therefore the same RNA polymerase molecule must be used for
the synthesis of  these three  kinds of RNA,  and this RNA polymerase
must be the one that the biochemists purify.

Unfortunately there is an imperfection in the reasoning leading to the
conclusion that E. coli cells contain only a single type of RNA polym-
erase molecule. That imperfection came to light with the discovery that
the prokaryotic RNA polymerase is not a single polypeptide but in fact
contains  four  different  polypeptide  chains.  Therefore,  the  rifamycin
experiment  proves  that  the  same  polypeptide  is  used  by  whatever
polymerases synthesize the different classes of RNA. Much more ardu-
ous  biochemical  reconstruction  experiments  have  been  required  to
exclude the possibility that bacteria contain more than one single basic
core RNA polymerase.

Three RNA Polymerases in Eukaryotic Cells

Investigation of eukaryotic cells shows that they do contain more than
one type of RNA polymerase. The typical protein fractionation schemes
used by biochemists to purify proteins yield three distinct types of RNA
polymerase from a variety of higher cells. These three species are called
RNA polymerases I, II, and III for the order in which they elute from an
ion exchange column during their purification.

RNA  polymerase  I  synthesizes  ribosomal  RNA.  It  is  found  in  the
nucleolus, an organelle in which ribosomal RNA is synthesized. Further
confirmation of this conclusion is the finding that only purified RNA
polymerase I is capable of correctly initiating transcription of ribosomal
RNA in vitro. A simple experiment demonstrating this is to use DNA
containing ribosomal RNA genes as a template and then to assay the
strand-specificity of the resulting product. RNA polymerase I synthe-
sizes RNA predominantly from the correct strand of DNA, whereas RNA
polymerases II and III do not.

RNA polymerase II is the polymerase responsible for most synthesis
of messenger RNA. In vitro experiments show that, of the three, this
polymerase is the most sensitive to a toxin from mushrooms, α-amanitin
(Fig. 4.7). The addition of low concentrations of α-amanitin to cells or
to isolated nuclei blocks additional synthesis of just messenger RNA.
Further, α-amanitin-resistant cells possess a toxin-resistant RNA polym-
erase II.

RNA  polymerase  III  is  less  sensitive  to  α-amanitin  than  is  RNA
polymerase II, but it is sufficiently sensitive that its in vivo function can
be  probed. The sensitivity profile for synthesis of tRNA and 5S RNA
parallels the  sensitivity  of RNA polymerase III. In vitro transcription
experiments with purified polymerase III also show that this enzyme
synthesizes tRNA and 5S ribosomal RNA as well as some of the RNAs
found in spliceosomes as discussed in the next chapter.

Multiple but Related Subunits in Polymerases

How can one be sure that an enzyme contains multiple subunits? One
of the best methods for detection of multiple species of polypeptides in
a sample is electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel. If the protein
has been denatured by boiling in the presence of the detergent sodium
dodecyl sulfate, SDS, and the electrophoresis is performed in the pres-
ence of SDS, polypeptides separate according to size. This results from
the  fact  that  the  charged  SDS  anions  that  bind  to  the  polypeptides
completely  dominate  the  charge  as  well  as  force  all  polypeptides  to
adopt a rodlike  shape whose  length  is proportional  to  the  molecular

weight of the protein. Therefore, in most cases two polypeptides of the
same size will migrate at the same rate and two of different molecular
weight  will  migrate  at  different  rates.  Following  electrophoresis,  the
positions of proteins in the gel can be visualized by staining. Each band
on a gel derives from a different-sized polypeptide species.

When purified E. coli RNA polymerase is subjected to SDS polyacry-
lamide gel electrophoresis, five distinct bands are seen (Fig. 4.8). The
mere  presence  of  multiple  polypeptides  in  purified  enzyme  doesn’t
prove that all the peptides are necessary for activity. Do all the bands
on the gel represent subunits of RNA polymerase or are some of the
bands extraneous proteins that adventitiously copurify with RNA po-
lymerase? A reconstitution experiment provides the most straightfor-
ward demonstration that the four largest polypeptides found in RNA
polymerase  are  all  essential  subunits  of  the enzyme.  The  four bands
from an SDS polyacrylamide gel are cut out, the proteins eluted, and
SDS removed. RNA polymerase activity can be regained only if all four
of the proteins are included in the reconstitution mixture.

RNA polymerase from E. coli consists of subunits β’ and β of molecu-
lar weights 155,000 and 151,000, two subunits of α whose molecular
weight is 36,000, a low molecular weight subunit ω whose presence is
not necessary for activity, and one somewhat less tightly-bound subunit,
σ of 70,000 molecular weight. Measurement of the amounts of each of
the five proteins on SDS polyacrylamide gels shows that the enzyme
contains two copies of the α subunit for every single copy of the others,
that is, the subunit structure of RNA polymerase is σα2ββ’ω.

The reconstitution experiments permit pinpointing the actual target

of rifamycin. RNA polymerase from rifamycin-sensitive and rifamycin-
resistant cells is subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Then reconstitution experiments with the two sets of proteins can be
performed in all possible combinations to determine which of the four
subunits from the rifamycin-resistant polymerase confers resistance to
the reconstituted enzyme. The β subunit was found to be the target of
rifamycin.

If we view the RNA polymerase as a biochemical engine, then it is
reasonable  to  expect  each  subunit  to  have  a  different  function.  As
discussed below, rifamycin inhibits initiation by RNA polymerase, but

it has no effect on the steps of elongation of the polynucleotide chain.
A different antibiotic, streptolydigin, has also been found to inhibit RNA
polymerase. This blocks elongation steps, and therefore we might have
expected to find a subunit other than β to be the target of this drug. Alas,
however, the β subunit is also the target of streptolydigin. Some spe-
cialization exists. The β subunit binds ribonucleotides and possesses the
catalytic site while the β’ subunit binds DNA. Most likely the larger two
subunits are comprised of a number of domains, each playing a different
role in the initiation and elongation of RNA. Evolution seems to have
conserved the structures and functions of some of these different do-
mains.  The  larger  subunits  from  prokaryotic  and  the  three  types  of
eukaryotic RNA polymerase all share significant homology. Regions of
homology are also found amongst the other subunits as well.

The combined molecular weights of the subunits of RNA polymerase
total nearly one half million, but from a mechanistic viewpoint it is not
at all clear why the polymerase should be so  large.  Phage  T7, which
grows in E. coli, encodes its own RNA polymerase, and this enzyme has
a molecular weight of only about 100,000. Apparently the actual RNA
initiation and elongation steps do not require an enzyme as large as the
E. coli polymerase. Perhaps the large size of the cellular polymerases
permits  them  to  initiate  from  a  wider  variety  of  promoters  and  to
interact with a variety of auxiliary regulatory proteins.

The eukaryotic RNA polymerases are also large and possess multiple
subunits. RNA polymerase II from many different organisms has been
shown to contain 12 different polypeptides. The largest three are ho-
mologous to β’, β, and  α of the E. coli RNA polymerase. Fig. 4.9 shows
the shared homology of the β’ subunit among the E. coli, vaccinia virus,
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae polymerases II and III. The RNA polym-
erases I and III possess five subunits in common with RNA polymerase
II. 

The eukaryotic polymerases contain more subunits than the E. coli
RNA polymerases. Part of the differences may merely be in the tightness
with which subunits cling together. For example, a protein from E. coli

Multiple Sigma Subunits  95

that is involved with RNA chain termination, the nusA gene product,
could be considered a part of RNA polymerase because it binds to the
polymerase  after  initiation  has occurred and  after  the σ  subunit has
been released from the core complex of β, β’, and α. Since however, it
does not copurify with the RNA chain elongating activity that is con-
tained in the core, it usually is not classified as part of RNA polymerase.
Some  of  the  peptides  in  the  eukaryotic  polymerase  might  just  stick
together more tightly.

One notable difference between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic po-
lymerases is that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II possesses at
its C-terminal end a heptad of (Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser) repeated
25  to  50  times.  This  C-terminal  domain,  or  CTD,  can  be  multiply
phosphorylated by any of several proteins known to activate transcrip-
tion on various promoters. It appears that the unphosphorylated form
of the CTD helps RNA polymerase bind and interact with the auxiliary

***********
**

proteins necessary for transcription initiation, but that the CTD must
be phosphorylated before it can release from the initiation proteins and
allow the polymerase to elongate freely. Cells constructed so as to lack
the CTD, or cells in which the CTD is too short are sick or inviable.

Multiple Sigma Subunits

In vitro transcription experiments with the E. coli RNA polymerase have
shown that the σ subunit is required for initiation at promoters, but that
σ is not required for elongation activity. In fact, the σ subunit comes off
the polymerase when the  transcript  is  between  2 and  10 nucleotides
long.  Polymerase  lacking  the σ  subunit,  core  polymerase,  binds  ran-
domly to DNA and initiates nonspecifically or from nicks, but it rarely
initiates from promoters. These results raise an interesting question: If
the σ subunit is required for promoter recognition, then could different
σ  subunits  be  used  to  specify  transcription  from  different  classes  of
genes? The answer is yes.

Although  many  years  of  searching  were  required,  sigma  subunits
specific for more than five different specific classes of genes have been
found in E. coli. Most transcription is initiated by the σ70 subunit. Not
only in E. coli, but in all types of cells, heat shock induces the synthesis
of about 40 proteins that aid in surviving the stressful conditions. One
of  the  proteins  induced  in  E.  coli  by  heat  shock  is  a  σ  factor  that
recognizes promoters located in front of other heat shock responsive
genes. Other σ factors are used for transcription of nitrogen regulated

96  RNA Polymerase and RNA Initiation

genes,  the  flagellar  and  chemotaxis  genes,  and  genes  induced  under
oxidative stress.

Developmentally  regulated  genes  are  another  area  in  which  the
specificity provided by σ factors proves useful. Bacillus subtilis forms
spores under some conditions. Synthesizing a spore requires conversion
of one cell into two drastically different cells. One ultimately becomes
the spore, and the other completely surrounds the maturing spore and
synthesizes the protective cell wall of the spore. Cascades of different
sigma factors turn on the appropriate genes in these two cell-types.

Eukaryotic polymerases appear to contain an analog of the σ subunit.
This  protein  is  required  for  correct  initiation,  reduces  nonspecific
initiation, and competes for binding to the polymerase with the bacterial
σ subunit.

The Structure of Promoters

Some  proteins  in  the  cell  are  needed  in  high  quantities  and  their
messenger RNAs are synthesized at a high rate from active promoters.
Other proteins are required in low levels and the promoters for their
RNAs have  low activity. Additionally, the synthesis of  many proteins
must respond to changing and unpredictable conditions inside or out-
side  the  cell.  For  this  last  class,  auxiliary  proteins  sense  the  various
conditions and appropriately modulate the activities of the promoter.
Such promoters must not possess significant activity without the assis-
tance of an auxiliary protein. Not surprisingly, then, the sequences of
promoters  show  wide  variations.  Yet  behind  it  all,  there  could  be
elements of a basic structure or structures contained in all promoters.
As  the  first  few  bacterial  promoters  were sequenced, considerable
variation was observed between their sequences, and their similarities
could not be distinguished. When the number of sequenced promoters
reached about six, however, Pribnow noticed that all contained at least
part of the sequence TATAAT about six bases before the start of mes-
sengers, that is, 5’XXXTATAATXXXXXAXXXX-3’, with the messenger
often beginning with A. This sequence is often called the Pribnow box.
Most bacterial promoters also possess elements of a second region of
conserved sequence, TTGACA, which lies about 35 base pairs before the
start  of  transcription.  Examination  of  the  collection  of  E.  coli  σ70
promoters reveals not only the bases that tend to be conserved at the
-35 and -10 regions, but also three less well conserved bases near the
transcription  start  point  (Fig.  4.10).  The  figure  also  shows  that  the
spacing  between  the  -35  and -10  elements  is  not  rigidly  retained,  al-
though the predominant spacing is 17 base pairs. To a first approxima-
tion, the more closely a promoter matches the -10 and -35 sequences
and  possesses  the  correct  spacing  between  these  elements,  the more
active the promoter. Those promoters that utilize regulatory proteins to
activate  transcription  deviate  from the consensus  sequences  in  these
regions. These activating proteins must help the polymerase through
steps of the initiation process that it can do by itself on “good” promot-
ers. The promoters that are activated by other σ factors possess other

contacts both regions of the DNA. Direct experiments have shown this
is the case. Perhaps the most elegant was the generation of a hybrid
promoter with a -35 region specific for one type of σ and a -10 region
specific for a different σ. The hybrid promoter could be activated only
by a hybrid σ subunit containing the appropriate regions from the two
normal σ subunits.

Protection of promoters from DNAse digestion, chemical modifica-
tion, and electron microscopy have shown that polymerase indeed is
bound to the -35 and -10 regions of DNA before it begins transcription
and that it contacts the DNA in these areas. Experiments of the type
described in Chapters 9 and 10 have permitted direct determination of

RNA polymerase contacts. These areas are clustered in the regions of
the  conserved  bases  in  the  -35,  -10,  and  +1  areas  (Fig.  4.11).  These

reverse question of which polymerase subunits contact these bases.

Study  of  eukaryotic  promoters  reveals  relatively  few  conserved  or
consensus sequences. Most eukaryotic promoters possess a TATA se-
quence located about 30 base pairs before the transcription start site.
In yeast, however, this sequence is found up to 120 base pairs ahead of

point. The apparatus required for initiation is the polymerase plus at
least six additional proteins or protein complexes (Fig. 4.12). The first
to bind is TFIID. This is a complex of about ten different proteins. The
one that binds the TATA sequence is called TATA-binding protein, and
the  others  are  called  TATA  associated  factors  or  TATA  associated
proteins. Although TFIID was first recognized as necessary for initiating
transcription by RNA polymerase II, at least the TATA-binding protein
of TFIID is now known to be required for initiation by all three types of
RNA polymerase, I, II, and III. At the promoters served by RNA polym-
erase II, after TFIID  binds, then TFIIA and B bind followed by RNA
polymerase II. After this TFIIE, F, G and still others bind. The order of
protein binding in vitro and the approximate location of binding of the
proteins  was  assayed  using  DNAse  footprinting  and  the  migration
retardation assay. In this assay, a piece of DNA about 200 base pairs
long is incubated with various proteins and then subjected to electro-
phoresis under conditions that increase the tightness of proteins bind-
ing to the DNA. The DNA migrates at one rate, and the protein-DNA
complex  migrates  more  slowly  through  the  gel,  thereby  permitting
detection and quantitation of protein binding to DNA.

The proteins mentioned in the previous section are termed basal factors.
They are required on all promoters and constitute a core of the tran-
scription activity. Additionally, eukaryotic promoters often also possess
one or more 8-to-30 base-pair elements located 100 to 10,000 base pairs
upstream  or  downstream  from  the  transcription  start  point.  Similar
elements  are  found  with  prokaryotic  promoters,  but  less  frequently.
These elements enhance the promoter activity by five to a thousand-fold.
They were first found in animal viruses, but since then have been found
to  be  associated  with  nearly  all  eukaryotic promoters.  The  term, en-
hancer, is shifting slightly in meaning. Originally it meant a sequence
possessing  such  enhancing  properties.  As  these  enhancers  were  dis-
sected, frequently they were found to possess binding sites for not just
one, but sometimes up to five different proteins. Each of the proteins
can possess enhancing activity, and now the term enhancer can mean
just the binding site for a single enhancer protein.  

Remarkably, enhancer elements still function when their distances
to the promoter are altered, and frequently they retain activity when the
enhancers are turned around, or even when they are placed downstream
from  the  promoter.  Proteins  bound  to  the  enhancer  sequences  must
communicate with the RNA polymerase or other proteins at the pro-
moter. There are two ways this can be done, either by sending signals
along the DNA between the two sites as was first suggested, or by looping
the DNA to permit the two proteins to interact directly (Fig. 4.13). Most
of  the  existing  data  favor  looping  as  the  method  of  communication
between most enhancers and their associated promoter.

A second remarkable property of enhancers is their interchangeabil-
ity. Enhancers frequently confer the appropriate regulation properties

on multiple promoters. That is, an enhancer-binding protein senses the
cellular  conditions  and  then  stimulates  appropriately  whatever  pro-
moter is nearby. Enhancers confer specific responses that are sensitive
to tissue-type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. For
example, when an enhancer that provides for steroid-specific response
of a gene is placed in front of another gene and its promoter, the second
gene acquires a steroid-specific response. That is, enhancers are general
modulators of promoter activity, and in most cases a specific enhancer
need not be connected to a specific promoter.  Most enhancers are able
to function in association with almost any promoter. Not surprisingly,
a promoter that must function in many tissues, for example, the pro-
moter  of  a  virus  that  grows  in  many  tissues,  has  many  different  en-
hancers associated with it.

Enhancer-Binding Proteins

Some enhancer-binding proteins like the glucocorticoid receptor pro-
tein have been purified and studied in vitro. Other enhancer-binding
proteins,  like  the  GAL4  and GCN4  proteins from  yeast,  can  be  engi-
neered and studied in vivo without ever purifying the protein. Both types
of studies indicate that enhancer proteins possess multiple independent
domains. The DNA-binding domain of the GAL4 enhancer protein can
be  replaced  with  the  DNA-binding  domain  of  a  bacterial  repressor
protein, LexA (Fig. 4.14). When the LexA-binding sequence is placed in
front  of  some  other  yeast  gene,  the  gene  acquires  the  ability  to  be
induced by the GAL4-LexA hybrid protein when galactose is present.
The  glucocorticoid  receptor  protein  possesses  DNA-binding,  steroid-
binding,  and  activation  domains.  These  too  can  be  separated  and
interchanged.

The  regions  of  enhancer  proteins  necessary  for  activation  can  be
explored. By progressively deleting protein from an activating domain,
both Ptashne and Struhl have found that stretches of negatively charged
amino acids on some activator  proteins are required for activation. In

GCN4,  two  such  regions  are  required  for  full  activation  abilities.  It
appears necessary that these negatively charged amino acids all lie on
one face of an alpha helix. The other side of the helix can be hydropho-
bic.  Activating  helices  can  be  designed  de  novo  if  they  follow  these
principles,  but  if  the  charged  amino  acids  are  shuffled,  they  do  not
activate. Other structures in addition to negatively charged surfaces of
α-helices also function  to activate RNA polymerase. Some enhancer-
binding proteins lack significant negatively charged regions and instead
possess large quantities of proline or glutamine.

Many enhancer proteins may be relatively simple. They can possess
nearly  independent  domains  for  DNA-binding,  for  binding  a  small
molecule  like  a  hormone,  and  for  activating  RNA polymerase or  the
basal machinery. The binding of a hormone may unmask the DNA-bind-
ing domain or the activation domain of the protein. In some cases the
activating  domain  may  be  little  more  than  a  high  concentration  of
negative charge whose interaction with TFIID activates transcription.
Activation in eukaryotes has to contend with the presence of histones
tightly-bound to the DNA. Undoubtedly, their presence interferes with
transcription. Some activator proteins therefore overcome the repres-
sive effects of bound histones. Other activator proteins can be expected
to go beyond overcoming repression, and will stimulate transcription.
The  number  of  different  enhancer-binding  proteins  appears  to  be
remarkably small in nature.  Repeatedly, researchers are finding  that
some of the enhancer proteins from one gene are highly similar to one
that controls another gene, either in that same organism or in a different
organism. Not only are the sequences of such proteins similar, but they
are  functionally  interchangeable.  Heterologous  in  vitro  transcription
systems  can  be  constructed  in  which  enhancer  proteins  from  yeast
activate transcription from a human system. The yeast GCN4 protein is
similar to the AP-1, c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos proteins. AP-1 is a mammal-

ian protein that binds upstream from promoters, and c-myc, c-jun, and
c-fos are proteins that sometimes mutate and induce oncogenic growth
of cells.

Many  of  the  enhancer-binding  proteins  interact  with  the  TFIID
complex.  Because  gene  regulation  is  so  important  to  the  cell  and
because many different genes in a cell must be regulated, we can expect
a wide diversity of interaction modes (Fig. 4.15). The enhancer-binding
proteins  can  interact  directly,  via  adapters,  or  in  cooperation  with
coadapters. Additionally, proteins that are part of the TFIID complex or
the other proteins may be required for some interactions and interfere
with  others.  That  is,  a  protein  may  play  an  activating  role  in  the
expression  of  some  genes  and  a  repressing  role  in  the  expression  of
others.

DNA Looping in Regulating Promoter Activities

DNA  looping  is  a  reasonable  way  enhancers  can  interact  with  the
transcription apparatus. The available data say that this, indeed, is one
of the ways they work. For example, an enhancer can be placed on one
DNA circle, and the promoter it stimulates on another DNA circle. When
the DNA rings are linked, the enhancer functions. This shows that the
enhancer must be close to the promoter in three-dimensional space. The
linking  experiment  also  shows  that  a  protein  or  signal  doesn’t  move
down the DNA from the enhancer to the promoter. 

DNA looping solves two physical problems in gene regulation. The
first concerns space. Regulatory proteins must do two things. They sense
intracellular  conditions,  for  example,  the  presence  of  a  growth  hor-
mone. They then must turn on or turn off the expression of only those
genes  appropriate  to  the  conditions.  These  responses  require  that  a
signal be transmitted from a sensor part of the regulatory protein to the
cellular apparatus responsible for transcribing or initiating transcrip-
tion from the correct gene. The phrase “correct gene” is the key here.
How can the regulatory protein confine its activity to the correct gene?

RNA polymerase

Sites for potential regulatory proteins

polymerase molecule.

The easiest, and virtually the only general way for a regulatory protein
to recognize the correct gene is for the protein to recognize and bind to
a DNA sequence near or within the correct gene.

If  a  regulatory  protein  is  bound  adjacent  to  an  RNA  polymerase
molecule  or  adjacent  to  an  auxiliary  protein  required  for  initiating
transcription, we can imagine direct protein-protein contacts for com-
munication  of  the  necessary  signals.  The  space  problem  arises  since
only a limited number of proteins may bind immediately adjacent to the
transcription initiation complex (Fig. 4.16). The limit seems to be two
to four proteins. Since the regulatory pattern of many genes is complex
and likely to require the combined influence of more than two or three
regulatory proteins, we have a problem.

How can more than a couple of proteins directly influence the RNA
polymerase? DNA looping is one answer. A regulatory protein can be
bound  within  several  hundred  or  several  thousand  base  pairs  of  the
initiation complex and directly touch the complex by looping the DNA.
With DNA looping a sizeable number of proteins can simultaneously
affect transcription initiation via multiple loops. Additional possibilities
exist. For example, proteins could regulate by helping or hindering loop
formation or alternative looping could exist in the regulation scheme of
a gene.

A second reason for DNA looping is the cooperativity generated by a
system that loops. Consider a system in which a protein can bind to two
DNA sites separated by several hundred base pairs and then the proteins
can  bind  each  other,  thus  forming  a  DNA  loop.  A  different  reaction
pathway can also be followed. A molecule of the protein could bind to
one of the sites and a second molecule of the protein could bind to the
first.  By  virtue  of  the  potential  for  looping,  the  concentration  of  the
second protein in the vicinity of the second DNA site has been increased.
Such a concentration change increases the occupancy at the second
site above the value it would have in the absence of looping. Hence, the
presence of one site and looping increases occupancy of the second site.
Such a cooperativity can substantially facilitate binding at low concen-
trations  of regulatory proteins. It also eliminates any time lags upon
gene induction associated with diffusion of a protein to its DNA-binding
site.

Increasing  the  local  concentration  of  a  regulatory  protein  near its
binding site solves a serious problem for cells. Thousands of regulatory

104  RNA Polymerase and RNA Initiation

proteins must be present in a bacterial cell and tens of thousands of
regulatory  proteins  may  have  to  be  present  in  the  nucleus  of  some
eukaryotic cells. Since the total protein concentration possible in the
cell or nucleus is limited to about 200 mg/ml, and since the same space
must be shared  with the  chromosome and  housekeeping proteins  as
well, the concentration possible for any one type of regulatory protein
is strictly limited.

How then can the requisite binding of the regulatory protein to its
DNA target sequence be achieved? Basically, the effective concentration
of the protein must be high relative to the dissociation constant from
the site. If the affinity is too high, however, the tightness of binding may
make  the  dissociation  rate  from  the  site  so  slow  that  the  protein’s
presence interferes with normal cellular activities like DNA replication,
recombination, and repair. A nice solution to these contradictory re-
quirements is to build a system in which the affinity of the protein for
the site is not too high, the overall concentration of the protein in the
cell is not too high, but the local concentration of the protein just in the
vicinity  of  the  binding  sites  is  high.  DNA  looping  provides  a  simple
mechanism for increasing the local concentrations of regulatory pro-
teins.

Steps of the Initiation Process

The beginning state for initiation by RNA polymerase is a polymerase
molecule  and  a  promoter  free  in  solution,  and  the  end  state  is  a
polymerase molecule bound to DNA elongating an RNA chain. In this
state the DNA is partially melted so that base-pairing of ribonucleotides
to  the  template  strand  of  the  DNA  can  be  used  to  determine  the
nucleotides to be incorporated into the RNA. The initiation process that
separates the two states must be continuous, but it may well be approxi-
mated as consisting of discrete steps. Can any of these be detected and
quantitated and, if so, can measurement of the rates of proceeding from
one such state to the next during the initiation process provide useful
information? Ultimately we would hope  that studies like these could
explain  the  differences  in  activities  between  promoters  of  different
sequence as well as provide the information necessary to design pro-
moters with specific desired activities or properties.

The first biochemical characterizations of the binding and initiation
rates of RNA polymerase on promoters were performed on highly active
promoters of bacterial origin. Such a choice for a promoter is natural
because  it  maximizes  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  in  the  data.  The  data

obtained by Chamberlin with these promoters indicated that the initia-
tion process could be dissected into two steps: a rapid step during which
polymerase binds to DNA and a slower “isomerization” step in which
RNA polymerase shifts to an active form capable of immediately initi-
ating transcription (Fig. 4.17). Later studies on a wide variety of pro-
moters  indicates  that  this  approximation  is  generally  useful.  Some
promoters possess additional discernible steps in the initiation process.
It  is  natural  to  expect  that  the  first  step  would  be  the  point  for
regulation of transcription. Since cells need to have promoters of widely
differing activity as well as promoters whose activities can be controlled,
it seems sensible that the binding step would vary among promoters,
and if auxiliary proteins are required for initiation at a promoter, they
would alter the binding rate. If the regulation of initiation by auxiliary
proteins occurred after the binding step, for example in the isomeriza-
tion step, then many polymerase molecules in cells would be nonpro-
ductively  bound  at  promoters.  This  would  be  a  waste  of  substantial
numbers of polymerase molecules. Apparently we lack important infor-
mation, for nature actually has it both ways. Some weak promoters have
good binding of polymerase, but slow isomerization, whereas the re-
verse  is  true  with  others.  Similarly,  on  some  regulated  promoters
regulation is at the binding step, and on others the regulation occurs at
the isomerization step or at a step subsequent to isomerization.

Measurement of Binding and Initiation Rates 

What  experiments  can  be  done  to  resolve  unambiguously  questions
about binding and initiation rates? One of the easiest measurements to
perform with RNA polymerase is quantitation of the total RNA synthe-
sized. It is tempting to try to adapt such measurements to the determi-
nation  of  binding  and  activation  rates  of  RNA  polymerase.  The
execution  of  the  experiments  and  the  interpretation  of  the  data  are
difficult, however, and many misleading experiments have been done.

Figure 4.18  Generation of abortive initiation products by provision of only the
first two nucleoside triphosphates required by a promoter.

Somewhat more direct measurements on the initiation of transcrip-
tion are possible. Such measurements were first performed by McClure,
who discovered that as RNA polymerase initiates in vitro it often goes
through several cycles of abortive initiation in which a short two or three
nucleotide,  or  sometimes  longer  polynucleotide  is  synthesized.  The
sequence of these abortive initiation products is the same as the 5’ end
of the normal RNA transcript. RNA, like DNA, is elongated in the 5’-to-3’
direction. After one short polynucleotide is made, RNA polymerase does
not  come  off  the  DNA,  but  it  remains  bound  at  the  promoter,  and
another attempt is made at initiation. Additionally, two conditions lead
to the exclusive synthesis of the short polynucleotides: the presence of
rifamycin or the absence of one or more of the ribonucleoside triphos-
phates (Fig. 4.18). If nucleotides are omitted, those present must permit
synthesis of a 5’ portion of the normal transcript. Under these condi-
tions, a polymerase molecule bound to a promoter and in the initiation
state will continuously synthesize the short, abortive initiation polynu-
cleotides.

Assay  of  the  short  polynucleotides  synthesized  under  conditions
where longer  polynucleotides cannot be synthesized provides a good
method of assaying initiation by RNA polymerase on many promoters.
The measurement is free of complexities generated by multiple initia-
tions at a single promoter or of the difficulties in interpretation gener -
ated by the addition of inhibitors. All that is necessary is the omission
of  the  appropriate  nucleoside  triphosphates.  Once  RNA  polymerase
initiates on a promoter, it begins production of short polynucleotides,
but nothing else happens at this copy of the promoter.

Let us consider the possibility that the time required for RNA polym-
erase  molecules  to  locate  and  bind  to  the  promoters  is  a  significant
fraction of the total time required for binding and initiation. An experi-
ment can be performed by mixing RNA polymerase, DNA containing a
promoter,  and  two  or  three  of  the  ribonucleoside  triphosphates  and
measuring the kinetics of appearance of the short polynucleotides that
signal initiation. Suppose that the same experiment is repeated but with
the RNA polymerase at twice the original concentration (Fig. 4.19). In
this case the time required for RNA polymerase to find and bind to the
promoter should be half as long as in the first case, but the time required
for the isomerization part of the initiation process will remain the same.

RNA  polymerase  and  DNA  at  two  polymerase  concentrations  differing  by  a
factor of two.

Overall, the synthesis of the short polynucleotides should begin sooner
when polymerase is provided at a higher concentration.

By varying the concentration of polymerase in a set of experiments
and appropriately plotting the results, we can extrapolate to determine
the results that would have been seen if polymerase had been added at
infinite  concentration.  In  such  a  situation,  the  delay  of  polymerase
binding to promoter should be zero. The residual delay in the appear-
ance of polynucleotides is  the time required for isomerization of the
polymerase and DNA to the active state. Knowing this, we can then work
back  and  determine  the  rate  of  binding  of  RNA  polymerase  to  the
promoter.

Consider now the possibility that the initial binding of RNA polym-
erase to promoters is fast and that the conversion of the bound polym-
erase to the active state is slow. If only a fraction of the promoters are
occupied  by  RNA  polymerase.  Increasing  the  concentration  of  RNA
polymerase  in  this  situation  will  also  increase  the  rate  of  the  initial
appearance of the polynucleotides. The reason is that the initial concen-
tration  of  polymerase  in  the  bound  state  increases  with  increasing
concentrations of polymerase in the reaction. The polynucleotide assay
permits  quantitation  of  the  apparent  binding  constant  and  of  the
isomerization rate for this situation as well. Most importantly, the assay
may also be used to determine how an auxiliary protein assists initiation
on some promoters.

Relating Abortive Initiations to Binding and Initiating

The binding and initiation reactions explained in the previous section
are described by the following equation:

where R is RNA polymerase free in solution, P is uncomplexed promoter
RPc is promoter with RNA polymerase bound in an inactive state defined
as “closed,”  and RP0 is  promoter  with  RNA  polymerase  bound in  an
active state called “open” because it can immediately begin transcrip-
tion if provided nucleotides.

If  RNA  polymerase  and  DNA  containing  a  promoter  are  mixed
together, then the concentration of RP0 at all times thereafter can be
calculated in terms of the initial concentrations R and P and the four
rate constants; however, the resulting solution is too complex to be of
much use. A reasonably close mathematical description of the actual
situation can be found by making three approximations. The first is that
R  be  much  greater  than  Po.  This  is  easily  accomplished  because  the
concentrations of R and P added are under the experimentalist’s control.
The second is known to enzymologists as the steady-state assumption.

above are such that, during times of interest, the rate of change in the
amount of RPc, is small, and the amount of RPc can be considered to be
in equilibrium with R, P, and RPc. That is, 

dRPc

dt

  =  k1 R  ×  P  −  k−1 RPc  −  k2 RPc  +  k−2 RPo  =  0 .

The third assumption is that k-2 is much smaller than k2. Experiments
show this to be a very good approximation. RNA polymerase frequently
takes  hours  or  days  to  dissociate  from  a  promoter.  Straightforward
solution of the equations then yields RPo as a function of time in a useful
form: 

RPo  =  (Pi n i t i a l)(1   −  e  −  ko b st  )

Figure 4.21  Determination of the kinetic parameters describing initiation by
DNA polymerase from a series of kobs values obtained at different RNA polym-
erase concentrations.

After starting the binding initiation assay, the total amount of oli-
gonucleotides synthesized by any time can be measured by removing a
sample from the synthesis mixture and chromatographically separating
nucleoside triphosphates from the short oligonucleotides. Since the rate
of oligonucleotide production is proportional to RP0, the total amount
of oligonucleotides synthesized as a function of time is given by 

t

∫  RPo(t’)dt’

 = (Pinitial)(t − 1⁄kobs + 1⁄kobse −kobst).

0

At very large t this increases linearly as Pinitial ( t − 1⁄kobs ). Hence extrapo-
lating the linear portion of the curve to the point of zero oligonucleotides
gives 1/kobs (Fig. 4.20). As seen above, 1/kobs in the limit of high R yields
1/k2. At other concentrations, (k-1 + k2/k1k2) is a linear function of 1/R.
Performing the abortive initiation reaction at a variety of concentrations
of R and measuring the kinetics of synthesis of oligonucleotides permits
straightforward evaluation of k2 (Fig. 4.21). Often, k-1 is much greater
than k2, in which case the ratio k1/k-1, called KB, or equivalently, k-1/k1
which is called Kd, is obtained as well.

A  variety  of  promoters  have  been  examined  by  these  techniques.
Highly active promoters must bind polymerase well and must perform
the initiation “isomerization” quickly. Less active promoters are poor
in binding RNA polymerase or slow in isomerization.

Roles of Auxiliary Transcription Factors

A strong promoter must have both a high affinity for polymerase and
also  a  high  isomerization  rate.  The  reverse  is  true  of  the  weakest
promoters. They have low affinity and slow isomerization  rates. Me-
dium-activity promoters are weak binders or slow at isomerization (Fig.
4.22). An auxiliary factor that stimulates RNA polymerase can change
either the binding constant or the isomerization rate. The lac operon

promoter is stimulated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein called CAP
or CRP.  Characterization  of  the lac  promoter  with and  without  CAP
shows that the protein primarily accelerates the isomerization step.

Melted DNA Under RNA Polymerase

One of the first steps of transcription is the binding of RNA polymerase
to  the  proper  sequence  on  the  DNA.  The  best  evidence  at  present
supports the notion that RNA polymerase reads the sequence of the DNA
and identifies the promoter in a double-stranded unmelted structure. It
is  theoretically  possible  that  the bases  of  the growing RNA  could  be
specified by double-stranded unmelted DNA, but it seems vastly easier
for these bases to be specified by Watson-Crick base pairing to a partially
melted DNA duplex.

Direct experimental evidence shows that during the initiation proc-
ess, RNA polymerase melts at least 11 base pairs of DNA. For example,
positions  on  adenine  rings  normally  occupied  in  base  pairs  become
available for chemical reaction if the pairs are disrupted, and their exact
positions along a DNA molecule can then be determined by methods
analogous to those used in DNA sequencing. Results obtained from this
type of measurement reveal that 11 base pairs of DNA from about the
middle of the Pribnow box to the start site of transcription are melted
when the RNA polymerase binds to a promoter.

A different method has also been used to measure the amount of DNA
that is melted by the binding of RNA polymerase. This method consists
of binding RNA polymerase to a nicked circular DNA molecule, sealing
the nick with polymerase still bound, and determining the change in the
supercoiling generated by the presence of the polymerase. If we assume
that  the  melted  DNA  strands  are  held  parallel  to  the  helix  axis,  this
method yields 17 base pairs melted. The problem is that no method has
been developed to determine whether the melted region contains any
twist.  If  it does,  then the  size  of  the  region that is  melted  cannot  be
precisely determined (Fig. 4.23).

The  melting  of  10  to  15  base  pairs  of  DNA  under  physiological
conditions requires appreciable energy because this length of oligomers

pairs opened by binding of a protein. In each of the three cases, 13 base pairs

one less twist.

hybridize together with a very high binding constant. The tight hybridi-
zation derives  from  the same  source  that pushes DNA to the double
helical structure, base stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds. Since
a  large  amount of  energy  is required to melt  the  DNA and  a  limited
amount  of  energy  is  available  from  the  binding  of  RNA polymerase,
thermal motion in the solution provides the activation energy for the
melting.  Once  this  occurs,  polymerase  binds  tightly  to  parts  of  the
separated strands and maintains the bubble. At low temperatures, and
therefore  lower  thermal  motion,  an  RNA  polymerase-DNA  duplex  is
much  less  likely  to  possess  the  requisite  activation  energy,  and  the
melting rate at lower temperatures is much reduced. At 0° virtually no
RNA polymerase bound to phage T7 DNA is able to initiate in reasonable
periods of time, while at 30° almost 100% has isomerized and is able to
initiate within a few minutes. Similarly, the melting rate is affected by
the salt concentration.

Problems 

4.1. If RNA polymerase subunits β and β’ constitute 0.005 by weight
of  the  total  protein  in  an  E.  coli  cell,  how  many  RNA  polymerase

112  RNA Polymerase and RNA Initiation

molecules are there per cell, assuming each β and β’ within the cell is
found in a complete RNA polymerase molecule? 

4.2. A typical E. coli cell with a doubling time of 50 minutes contains
10,000  ribosomes.  If  RNA  is  elongated  at  about  70  nucleotides  per
second,  how many  RNA  polymerase molecules must be synthesizing
ribosomal RNA at any instant? 

4.3. Proteins can protect the DNA sequence to which they have bound
from modification by some chemicals. What is a logical conclusion of
the fact that some bases in the -35 region of a promoter are not protected
by the presence of RNA polymerase, and yet their modification prior to
addition of RNA polymerase prevents open complex formation?

4.4. In Summers, Nature 223, 1111 (1969), what are the experimental
data  that  suggest  the  model  proposed  in  the  paper  is  incorrect  and
instead that phage T7 synthesizes its own RNA polymerase?

4.5.  Why  should  DNA  in  front  of  a  transcribing  RNA  polymerase
molecule  be  less  negatively  supercoiled  than  in  the  absence  of  the
polymerase, and why should the DNA behind the polymerase be more
negatively supercoiled?

 4.6. In light of the size and necessary DNA contacts made by the σ

subunit of RNA polymerase, comment on its probable shape.

4.7.  From  the  definition  of  optical  density,  OD,  and  the  fact  that
passage of a charged particle through a crystal of silver halide renders
it capable of being developed into a silver particle, estimate the number
of  P32  decays that are necessary in an autoradiograph experiment to
blacken an area equal to the size of a penny to an OD of 1.0. To solve
this, it will be necessary to look up some fundamental information on
photographic emulsions.

4.8. Why does urea or methyl mercury denature RNA?
4.9.  When  one  copy  of  an  enhancer  sequence  was  placed  in  any
position  upstream  from  a  reporter  gene,  the  expression  level  of  the
reporter  was  one.  The  enhancer  sequence  was  fully  occupied  by  the
enhancer protein. When two copies of the enhancer were placed up-
stream of the reporter, the expression level was not two as expected, but
was five to ten. What would the value of two have meant, and what does
the expression value of five to ten mean about the target of the enhancer-
binding proteins?

4.10. In one orientation an enhancer could work when placed any
distance from a promoter, but when inverted, it could work only if it
was  located  at  greater  than  a  critical  minimum  distance  from  the
promoter. Why?

 4.11. Suppose in vitro transcription from a promoter located on a
400-base-pair piece of DNA requires an auxiliary protein A in addition
to  RNA  polymerase.  In  experiments  to  determine  A’s  mechanism  of
action, order of addition experiments were performed (Fig. 4.24 ). Pro-
pose an explanation consistent with these data and an experiment to
confirm your hypothesis.

4.12. How might you attack the question of whether transcription of
DNA in eukaryotes displaces nucleosomes from the transcribed DNA?
4.13. Suppose we have a repressor that can prevent the binding of
RNA polymerase if it is bound to a site overlapping the RNA polymerase-
binding site, and which can completely block the progress of an RNA
polymerase if an elongating polymerase runs into it. Why would you
expect the effectiveness of the repressor to be higher when its binding
site overlaps the polymerase binding site than when its binding site is
located  at,  say,  +50?  Assume  all  the  relevant  kinetic  parameters  are
identical in the two cases.

Termination, and RNA
Processing

5

In  the  previous  chapter  we  considered  the  structure  of  RNA  polym-
erases, the transcription initiation process, the structure of promoters
and enhancers, and their functions. In this chapter we shall continue
with the transcription process. We shall briefly consider the elongation
process and then discuss the termination of transcription. Finally, we
shall discuss the processing of RNA that occurs after transcription. This
includes  both  the  simple  modification  of  RNA  by  cleavage  or  the
addition of groups and bases, and the more complex cutting, splicing,
and editing that occurs more often in eukaryotic cells than in prokary-
otic cells.

Polymerase Elongation Rate

Even more than in DNA synthesis, it is sensible for cells to regulate RNA
synthesis at the initiation steps so that the elaborate machinery involved
in independently regulating thousands of genes need not be built into
the basic RNA synthesis module. Once RNA synthesis has been initiated,
it proceeds at the same average rate on most, independent of growth
conditions. Can this be demonstrated? Another need for knowing the
RNA  elongation  rate  is  in  the  interpretation  of  physiological  experi-
ments. How soon after the addition of an inducer can a newly synthe-
sized mRNA molecule appear?

RNA elongation rate measurements are not too hard to perform in
vitro,  but  they  are  appreciably  more  difficult  to perform on  growing

the in vivo RNA elongation rate in Escherichia coli.

The  measurement  used  rifamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits  RNA
polymerase only at the initiation step. It has no effect on RNA polym-
erase molecules engaged in elongation. Rifamycin and radioactive urid-
ine were simultaneously added to bacteria; thus only those RNA chains
that were in the process of elongation at the time of the additions were
radioactively labeled, and no new ones could be initiated (Fig. 5.1). At
various times after the rifamycin and uridine addition, samples were
taken from the culture and their RNA was separated according to size

by  electrophoresis  on  polyacrylamide  gels.  Suppose  that  a  specific
species of RNA molecule is well separated from all other species by the
electrophoresis. Then, the radioactivity in this size class will increase
with  time  for  as  long  as  RNA  polymerase  molecules  transcribe  the
corresponding gene, but once the last polymerase molecule to initiate
has crossed the region, there can be no additional increase in radioac-
tivity. The interval between the addition of rifamycin and the end of the
period  over which radioactivity increases is the  time  required for  an
RNA polymerase molecule to transcribe from the promoter to the end
of the transcribed region.

The ribosomal RNA gene complexes were a convenient system for
these measurements. Each of these seven nearly identical gene com-
plexes  consists  of  two  closely  spaced  promoters,  a  gene  for  the  16S
ribosomal  RNA,  a  spacer  region,  a  tRNA  gene,  the  gene  for  the  23S
ribosomal RNA, and the gene for the 5S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 5.2). The
total length of this transcriptional unit is about 5,000 nucleotides. The
16S  RNA,  spacer  tRNA,  23S  RNA,  and  5S  RNA  are  all  generated  by
cleavage from the growing polynucleotide chain.

The interval between the time of rifamycin addition and the time at
which the last RNA polymerase molecule transcribes across the end of
the 5S gene is the time required for RNA polymerase to transcribe the
5,000 bases from the promoter to the end of the ribosomal gene com-
plex.  This  time  is  found  from  the  radioactive  uridine  incorporation
measurements. Transcription across the 5S gene ends when the radio -
activity in 5S RNA stops increasing. This happens about 90 seconds after
rifamycin and uridine addition (Fig. 5.3). This yields an elongation rate
of about 60 nucleotides per second. This type of elongation rate meas-
urement has been performed on cells growing at many different growth
rates, and as expected, the results show that the RNA chain growth rate
is independent of the growth rate of cells at a given temperature.

Transcription Termination at Specific Sites 

If transcription of different genes is to be regulated differently, then the
genes must be transcriptionally separated. Such transcriptional isola-
tion could be achieved without explicit transcriptional barriers between

genes if genes were widely spaced and if RNA polymerase occasionally
randomly terminated transcription. A more efficient method to separate
transcriptional units is merely to have transcription termination signals
at their ends.  

Transcription termination signals can be shown to exist by several
types of experiments. One that was first done in bacteria is genetic. As
mentioned  earlier,  transcriptional  units  are  called  operons.  Even
though  genes  in  two  different  operons  may  be  located  close  to  one
another on the chromosome, only by deleting the transcription termi-
nation signal at the end of one operon can genes of the second operon
be expressed under control of the first promoter (Fig. 5.4).

A second type of demonstration uses in vitro transcription. Radioac-
tive RNA is synthesized in vitro from a well-characterized DNA template
and separated according to size on polyacrylamide gels. Some templates
yield  a  discrete  class  of  RNA  transcripts  produced  by  initiation  at  a
promoter and termination at a site before the end of the DNA molecule.
Thus these templates must contain a transcription termination site. Of
course, cleavage of an RNA molecule could be mistaken for termination.

Simple experiments modifying the beginning and middle parts of genes
show that most often it is just the sequence at the end of the transcribed
region that specifies transcription termination. One simple mechanism
for transcription termination in bacteria utilizes just the RNA polym-
erase and requires only a special sequence near the 3’ end of the RNA.
The termination signal consists of a region rich in GC bases that can
form a  hairpin loop closely followed by  a  string of  U’s.  This  class  of
terminators  functions  without  the  need  for  auxiliary  protein  factors
from the cell. Frequently termination in eukaryotic systems occurs in a

run  of  U’s  as  in  the  prokaryotic  case,  but  no  hairpin  upstream  is
apparent.

Most likely as the RNA is elongated past the region rich in GC, it base
pairs  with  itself  to  form a hairpin  (Fig.  5.5).  This  hairpin  may  fit so
poorly in the transcript groove or canyon in the polymerase (Fig. 5.6),
that it weakens the binding of polymerase to the transcription bubble
and also causes the RNA polymerase to pause in this region. Release
then occurs from  the run of U’s. Direct  physical measurements have
shown that oligo (rU:dA) hybridizes with exceptional weakness com-
pared  to  other  oligonucleotides.  The  combination  of  these  factors
changes the RNA elongation complex from being extremely stable to
being so unstable that transcription termination usually occurs.

A  second  class  of  prokaryotic  terminators  is  much  different.  This
class  requires  the  presence  of  the  rho  protein  for  termination.  The
termination activity is further stimulated by a second protein, the nusA
gene  product.  During  transcription,  RNA  polymerase  pauses  near  a
termination sequence, most likely aided in pausing by the NusA protein,
and then rho terminates the transcription process and releases the RNA
and  RNA  polymerase. Analysis of the 3’  ends of  rho-dependent  tran-
scripts  reveals  them  to  contain  no  discernible  sequence  patterns  or
significant secondary structures. They have even less secondary struc-
ture than expected for completely random sequences.

Most likely, when the nascent RNA extending from the RNA polym-

erase is free of ribosomes and lacks significant secondary structure, the

rho protein can bind and move with the consumption of energy along
the  RNA  up  to  the  polymerase.  When  it  reaches  the  polymerase,  it
separates  the  growing  transcript  from  the  template  and  terminates
transcription. The separation of the two strands is accomplished by an
RNA-DNA helicase (Fig. 5.7).

The discovery of rho factor was accidental. Transcription of lambda
phage DNA in an in vitro system produced a large amount of incorrect
transcript. This inaccuracy was revealed by hybridizing the RNA to the
two separated strands of lambda phage. Correct transcripts would have
hybridized predominantly to only one strand. Apparently the conditions
being used for transcription did not faithfully reproduce those existing
within  the  cell  and  the  rho  factor  somehow  reduced  the  amount  of
incorrect transcription. This is a biochemist’s dream for it means that
something  must  exist  and  is  waiting  to  be  found.  Therefore  Roberts
looked for and found a protein in cell extracts that would enhance the
fidelity of in vitro transcription. Upon completing the purification and
in studying the properties of his “fidelity” factor, he discovered that it
terminated transcription. Rho factor shares suggestive properties with
a DNA helicase required in DNA replication, DnaB. Both bind to nucleic
acid and move along the nucleic acid with the consumption of ATP. In
the process of this movement, a complementary strand can be displaced.
Further, both helicases are hexameric, and both hydrolyze significant
amounts  of  ATP  when  in  the  presence  of  a  single-stranded  oligonu-
cleotide.

Although transcription termination and its regulation is usually de-
termined  only  by  events  occurring  near  the  3’  end  of  the  transcript,
sometimes  the 5’ end  is also involved.  The  transcription in E. coli of
ribosomal RNA and of some of  the genes of phage lambda depends
upon modifying the transcription complex shortly after the polymerase
crosses  a  special  sequence  near  the  promoter.  At  this  point  several
proteins bind to the RNA copy of the sequence and bind to the RNA
polymerase as well. After such a modification, elongation will proceed
to the end of the transcription unit and ignore some opportunities for
termination that would be utilized by an unmodified RNA polymerase.
It  would  be  amazing  if  eukaryotic  cells  did  not  also  utilize  this  as  a
mechanism for gene regulation.

Processing Prokaryotic RNAs After Synthesis 

It is not altogether surprising that intact transcripts produced by tran-
scription of some operons are not always suited for all the biological
roles of RNA. In E. coli the ribosomal and tRNAs are processed following
transcription. For example, RNAse III first cleaves in the portions of the
rRNA that are folded back on themselves to form  hairpins (Fig. 5.8).
Then other nucleases make additional cuts. RNAse III also cleaves the
early transcripts of phage T7. A number of methyl groups are also added
to the rRNA after its synthesis.

How  do  we  know  RNAse  III  cleaves  the  ribosomal  and  phage  T7
RNAs?  The  effects  of  mutations  are  one  way  to  attack  this  general
problem of demonstrating the in vivo role of an enzyme. Investigators
first isolated a mutant defective in RNAse III. They did this by screening
extracts prepared from isolated colonies of mutagenized cells for the
activity of the enzyme RNAse III (Fig. 5.9). One out of 1,000 colonies
yielded cells with greatly depressed levels of the enzyme. Subsequently,

these cells were found to possess appreciable quantities of uncleaved
ribosomal RNA. Furthermore, this RNA could be cleaved  in vitro with
purified RNAse III to yield the smaller ribosomal RNAs.

Although it occurs very rarely, messenger RNA in prokaryotic cells
can also be cut and rejoined. As the basic principles of such a splicing
reaction apply  equally well to eukaryotic mRNA, the phenomenon is
described more fully in the sections which follow.

S1 Mapping to Locate 5’ and 3’ Ends of Transcripts

Early in the investigation of a gene and its biological action, it is helpful
to learn its transcription start and stop points. One simple method for
doing this is S1 mapping, which was developed by Berk and Sharp. S1
is the name of a nuclease that digests single-stranded RNA and DNA. S1
mapping shows on the DNA the endpoints of homology of RNA mole-
cules.  That  is,  the  method  can  map  the  5’  and  3’  ends  of  the  RNA.
Consider  locating  the  5’  end  of  a  species  of  RNA  present  in  cells.
Messenger RNA is isolated from the organism, freed of contaminating
protein and DNA, then hybridized to end-labeled, single-stranded DNA
that covers the region of the 5’ end. After hybridization, the remaining
single-stranded RNA and DNA tails are removed by digestion with S1
nuclease.  The  exact  size  of  the  DNA  that  has  been  protected  from
nuclease digestion can then be determined by electrophoresis on a DNA
sequencing gel (Fig. 5.10). This size gives the distance from the labeled
end of the DNA molecule to the point corresponding to the 5’ end of the
RNA molecule.

Caps, Splices, Edits, and Poly-A Tails on Eukaryotic RNAs  127

Caps, Splices, Edits, and Poly-A Tails on Eukaryotic RNAs

Eukaryotic RNAs are processed at their beginning, middle, and terminal
sections.  Although  the  structures  resulting  from  these  posttranscrip-
tional  modifications  are  known,  why  the  modifications  occur  is  not
clear.

The 5’ ends of nearly all cellular messenger RNAs contain a “cap,” a
guanine in a reversed orientation plus several other modifications (Fig.
5.11). More precisely, the cap is a guanine methylated on its 7 position
joined  through  5’-5’  pyrophosphate  linkage  to  a  base  derived  from
transcription. Both the first and second bases after the capping nucleo-
tide  usually  are methylated. These  modifications  were  discovered  by
tracking down why and where viral RNA synthesized in vitro could be
methylated. The trail led to the 5’ end whose structure was then deter-
mined  by  Shatkin.  The  cap  helps  stabilize  the  RNA,  is  sometimes
involved in export to the cytoplasm, may be involved with splicing, and
also assists translation. Ribosomes translate cap-containing messengers
more efficiently than messengers lacking a cap.

A sizable fraction of the RNA that is synthesized in the nucleus of
eukaryotic cells is not transported to the cytoplasm. This RNA is of a
variety of sizes and sequences and is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA.
Within this class of RNA are messenger RNA sequences that ultimately
are translated into protein, but, as synthesized, the nuclear RNAs are
not directly translatable (Fig. 5.12). They contain extraneous sequences
that must be removed by cutting and splicing to form the continuous

The first base is 7-methylguanylate connected by a 5’-5’ triphosphate linkage to
the next base. The 2’ positions on bases 1 and 2 may or may not be methylated.

coding sequence that is found in the mature messenger in the cytoplasm.
The intervening sequences, which are removed from mature RNA, are
called introns, and the other parts of the messenger sequence are often
referred to as exons.

Another  type  of  modification  in  RNA  after  its  synthesis  is  called
editing. Although most RNAs are spliced, editing occurs very rarely. One
prominent example of editing is the apolipoprotein. Humans contain a
single copy of this gene. In the liver its gene product is 512,000 daltons
molecular weight, but in intestinal cells its gene product is only 242,000
daltons  molecular  weight.  Examination  of  the  mRNA  shows  that  a
specific  cytosine  of  the  RNA  is  converted  to  a  uracil  or  uracil-like
nucleotide in intestinal cells, but not in hepatic cells. This conversion
creates  a  translation  stop  codon,  hence  the  shorter  gene  product  in
intestinal cells. The conversion process involved is called RNA editing.
It is also found in some animal viruses. In a few extreme cases, hundreds
of nucleotides in an RNA are edited. In these cases, special short guide
RNA molecules direct the choice of inserted or deleted nucleotides.

The final type of RNA modification found in eukaryotic cells is the
posttranscriptional addition to the 3’ end of 30 to 500 nucleotides of
polyadenylic acid. This begins about 15 nucleotides beyond the poly-A
signal  sequence  AAUAAA.  Transcription  itself  appears  to  terminate
somewhat beyond the poly-A signal and processing quickly removes the
extra nucleotide before the poly-A addition.

The Discovery and Assay of RNA Splicing 

The discovery by Berget and Sharp and by Roberts and co-workers that
segments within newly synthesized messenger RNA could be eliminated
before the RNA was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was a
great surprise. Not only was the enzymology of such a reaction unfamil-

The Discovery and Assay of RNA Splicing   129

iar,  but  the  biological  need  for  such  a  reaction  was  not  apparent.
Although  splicing  is  a  possible  point  for cells  to  regulate  expression,
there  seemed  no  particular  need  for  utilizing  this  possibility.  One
possible  reason  for  splicing  could  be  in  the  evolution  of  proteins.
Intervening sequences place genetic spacers between coding regions in
a gene. As a result, recombination is more likely to occur between coding
regions than within them. This permits a coding region to be inherited
as an independent module. Not surprisingly then, the portions of pro-
teins that such modules encode often are localized structural domains
within proteins. As a result, during the evolution of a protein, domains
may be shuffled. It is hard to imagine, however, that this need was great
enough to drive the evolution of splicing.

The most plausible explanation for the existence of intervening se-
quences is that they are the remnants of a parasitic sequence that spread
through the genome of some early cell-type. In order that the sequence
not inactivate a coding region into which it inserted itself, the coding
region arranged that it splice itself out of mRNA. Thus, although the
parasitic sequence might have inserted into the middle of an essential
gene,  the  gene  was  not  inactivated.  After  transcription,  and  before
translation, the RNA copy of the gene containing the sequence was cut
and  spliced  to  recover  the  intact  uninterrupted  gene.  Now  that  the
intervening sequences are there, the cell is beginning to make use of
them. One example is regulating the use of alternative splice sites to
generate one or another gene product from a single gene.

Both the discovery of messenger splicing and a clear demonstration
of  splicing  used  adenovirus  RNA.  The  virus  provided  a  convenient
source  of  DNA  for  hybridization  reactions  and  RNA  extracted  from
adeno-infected cultured cells was a rich source of viral RNA. Electron
microscopy of hybrids formed between adenovirus mRNA and a frag-
ment of the adenovirus genome coding for the coat hexon protein was
performed  to  locate  the  transcriptional  unit.  Curiously,  the  hybrids
which formed lacked the expected structure. Many nucleotides at one

extraneous  RNA.  Further  experiments  with  longer  DNA  fragments
located DNA complementary to this RNA, but it was far away from the
virus hexon gene (Fig. 5.14). The RNA as extracted from the cells had
to have been synthesized, and then cut and spliced several times.

that has been spliced to remove introns yields duplexes and loops as
shown  in  Fig.  5.15.  The  locations  and  sizes  can  be  determined  by
digestion with S1 and ExoVII nucleases followed by electrophoresis on
denaturing  gels  and  on  gels  that  preserve  the  integrity  of  RNA-DNA
duplexes. Since S1 nuclease digests single-stranded RNA and DNA and
can act endonucleolytically, it removes all single-stranded or unpaired
regions  from  RNA  and  DNA.  ExoVII,  however,  digests  only  single-
stranded DNA, and only from the ends. This enzyme therefore provides
the additional information necessary to determine intron and exon sizes
and locations. After digestion with these enzymes, the oligonucleotides
can be separated according to size by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide
gels. Gels run with normal buffer near neutral pH provide the sizes of
the  double-stranded  duplex  molecules,  and  gels  run  at  alkaline  pH
provide  the  molecular  weights  of  the  denatured,  single-stranded  oli-
gonucleotides.

Involvement of the U1 snRNP Particle in Splicing

Initially, progress in the study of the biochemical mechanisms of splic-
ing was slow. One of the first clues about the mechanism of splicing
came from the sequencing of many splice sites. It was noticed that the
sequence flanking the 5’ splice site was closely complementary to the
sequence of RNA found at the 5’ end of an RNA found in the U1 class of
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles called snRNPs. In addition to
the U1 particles, U2, U4, U6, and others exist, each containing 90 to 150
nucleotides and about 10 different proteins. The complementarity be-
tween  U1  RNA  and  the  splice  site  of  pre-mRNA  suggested  that  base
pairing occurred between the two during splicing. Stronger evidence for
the proposal was the discovery by Steitz and Flint that splicing in nuclei
could be blocked by antibodies against U1 particles.

The experiment showing inactivation of splicing by anti-U1 antibod-
ies is not definitive since their specificity may not be high and because
other  antibodies  could  also  be  present.  One  ingenious  method  for
specifically inactivating U1 particles was to remove nucleotides from
their 5’ ends with RNAse H. This enzyme digests RNA from RNA-DNA

duplexes. DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the 5’ end of U1 RNA
were hybridized under gentle conditions to U1 particles in cell extracts
and then RNAseH was added. These treatments left the extracts unable
to catalyze intron removal whereas extracts which had received oligonu-
cleotides of different sequence were not inhibited.

One of the nicest demonstrations of biologically significant interac-
tions between two macromolecules are those in which compensating
mutations can be utilized. First, a mutation is isolated that interferes
with a particular interaction between A and B (Fig. 5.16). That is, A’ no
longer  interacts  with  B  in  vivo.  Then  a  compensating  mutation  is
isolated in B that potentiates the in vivo interaction between A’ and B’.
The  isolation  of  the  mutation  and  the  compensating  mutations  in
components of the splicing apparatus could not be done using tradi-
tional genetics tools since the splicing reactions occur in animals for
which only rudimentary genetics exists. Genetic engineering methods
had to be utilized.

Two  steps  are  necessary  to  perform  the  experiment.  The  first  is
inducing the cells to synthesize messenger with an altered splice site as
well as synthesize U1 RNA with an altered sequence, and the second is
assaying  for  splicing  of  the  special messenger  in  the  presence  of  the
normal cellular levels of messenger and pre-messenger RNAs. Weiner
introduced into the cells a segment of adenovirus sequence coding for
the E1a protein with wild-type or variant 5’ splice sites as well as the
gene for an altered U1. Only when DNA was introduced that encoded a
variant  U1  gene  that  compensated  for  the  splice  site  mutation  and
restored Watson-Crick base pairing across the region was the variant
splice site utilized (Fig. 5.17).

The  use  of  an  adenovirus  sequence  for  the  experiment  permitted
altering the splicing of a messenger which was not important to the cells.
Similarly, introducing a new gene for U1 RNA avoided disruption of the
ongoing cellular splicing processes. Finally, examining splicing in the

Figure 5.18  The pattern of splicing in adenovirus. The 5’ splice sites separating
regions A, B, and C are all joined to the 3’ splice site separating regions D and
E. Thus the three RNAs shown can be produced. The amount of the species ABE
can be determined by hybridizing to radioactive RNA complementary to ABC
and digesting with T1 and pancreatic RNAses. The amount of product of length
AB is determined by electrophoresis.

E1a gene from the virus increased the sensitivity since this gene contains
three  different  5’  splice  sites,  each  utilizing  the  same  3’  splice  site.
Damaging the activity of one 5’ splice site diverted splicing to the other
splice sites, whereas had there been only one 5’ splice site, altering it
might only have slowed kinetics of the splicing process without chang-
ing the actual amounts of RNA eventually spliced.

An RNAse protection assay was used to monitor the splicing. RNA
was isolated from the cells and hybridized with radioactive RNA com-
plementary to the adenovirus mRNA. The regions of the RNA which are
not  base  paired  are  sensitive  to  T1  and  pancreatic  RNAses  and  are
digested away (Fig. 5.18). This leaves a radioactive RNA molecule whose
size indicates the splice site utilized. A variant sequence at the middle
E1a splice site eliminated splicing from this location, but the introduc-
tion of the variant U1 gene to  the cells containing the compensating
mutation restored use of this splice site.

134  Transcription, Termination, and RNA Processing

Splicing Reactions and Complexes

In  addition  to  requiring  U1  snRNP  particles,  pre-mRNA  splicing  re-
quires  at  least  three  other  snRNPs,  U2,  U5,  and  U4/U6,  as  well  as  a
number of soluble proteins. Together these form a large complex that
can be observed in the electron microscope, and which can be biochemi-
cally purified. The complex forms in the nucleus even while the RNA is
being elongated, and exons near the 5’ end of the RNA can be removed
even before synthesis of the RNA is complete. Formation of the complex
requires  that  the  regions  to  which  both  U1  and  U2  bind  be  present.
Scanning by the splicing apparatus from 5’ to the 3’ end may help explain
the paradoxically high degree of specificity to splicing. The donor and
acceptor splice sites contain only two essential nucleotides, too few to
ensure  specificity  in  RNA  of  random  sequence.  It  is  likely  that  the
spacing  between  introns and  exons also helps the splicing  apparatus
choose sites appropriately. One purification method of spliceosomes is
to  synthesize  substrate  RNA  in  vitro.  This  RNA  is  synthesized  with
ordinary nucleotides plus biotin-substituted uridine. After the RNA has
been added to a splicing extract, the biotin can be used to fish out this
RNA selectively with streptavidin bound to a chromatography column.
Along with the RNA are found the U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 snRNAs.

The reaction of the mammalian splicing components is at least partly
ordered. U1 binds by base pairing to the 5’ splice site and U2 binds by
base pairing to a sequence within the intervening sequence containing
a  nucleotide  called  the branch  point  that  participates  in  the  splicing
reaction. The RNAs of U4 and U6 are extensively base paired whereas
a shorter region of base pairing is formed between the U6 and U2 RNAs
(Fig.  5.19).  In  the  course  of  the  splicing  reaction  the  U4  particle  is
released first. Splicing in yeast is similar to that found in mammals, but

differs in many small details. The same snRNPs are involved, but most
of the U RNAs are considerably larger than their mammalian counter-
parts. Only U4 and U6 are closely homologous in both organisms.

Sometimes extensive splicing is required to regenerate a single intact
mammalian gene. For example, there are genes containing one million
bases and 60 splice sites. Only a few genes in yeast are spliced, and they
contain only a few introns. Great specificity is required in order that all
of the splicing reactions proceed with sufficient fidelity that most of the
pre-messenger RNA molecules ultimately yield correctly spliced mes-
senger  RNA.  In  part,  we  still  do  not  know  the  reasons  for  the  high
fidelity. Although a consensus sequence at the 5’ and 3’ splice sites can
be derived by aligning many splice sites, there are only two invariant
and essential nucleotides present in each of the sites. This hardly seems
like enough information to specify correct splicing.

Once  in  vitro  splicing  reactions  could  be  performed  with  unique
substrates,  it  was  straightforward  to  examine  the  products  from  the
reactions. Amazingly, the sizes of the products as determined by elec-
trophoretic  separations  did  not  add  up  to  the  size  of  the  substrate
pre-mRNA. The structures were then determined by chemical means
and by electron microscopy of the resultant RNA molecules. The excised
RNA was found to be in a lariat form.

A
OH

OH

+

This results from the reaction of the nucleotide at the branch point
within  the  intron  attacking  the  phosphodiester  at  the  5’  splice  site.
Subsequent attack of the 3’-OH at the 5’ splice site on the phosphodiester
bond  at  the  3’  splice  site  releases  the  intron  in  a  lariat  form  and
completes  the  splicing  process.  The  freed  introns  in  lariat  form  are
rapidly degraded within the nucleus. 

The Discovery of Self-Splicing RNAs

Cech found that the nuclear ribosomal RNA from Tetrahymena contains
an intervening sequence. In efforts to build an in vitro system in which
splicing would occur, he placed unspliced rRNA in reactions containing
and lacking extracts prepared from cells. Amazingly, the control reac-
tions for  the  splicing  reactions,  those  lacking the added extract,  also
spliced  out  the  intervening  sequence.  Naturally,  contamination  was
suspected,  and  strenuous  efforts  were  made  to  remove  any  possible
Tetrahymena  proteins  from  the  substrate  RNA,  but  splicing  in  the
absence of Tetrahymena extract persisted. Finally, Cech placed the gene
for the rRNA on a plasmid that could replicate in E. coli, prepared the
DNA  from  E.  coli  cells,  a  situation  that  had  to  be  devoid  of  any
hypothetical  Tetrahymena  protein,  and  he  still  found  splicing.  This
proved,  to  even  the  most  skeptical,  that  the  Tetrahymena  rRNA  was

performing  splicing  on  itself  without  the  action  of  any  Tetrahymena
proteins.

As  shown  in  Fig.  5.20,  guanosine  is  essential  to  this  self-splicing
reaction,  but  it  does  not  contribute  chemical  energy  to  the  splicing
products.  Further  studies  on  the  Tetrahymena  self-splicing  reaction
show that not only is a 480 nucleotide section of RNA removed from the
middle of the ribosomal RNA, but the removed portion then goes on to
close on itself forming a circle and releasing a short linear fragment. At
first it seems surprising that neither ATP nor any other energy source
is  required  for  the  cutting  and  splicing  reactions.  The  reason  is  that
external energy is not required. Chemically, all the reactions are tran-
sesterifications  and  the  numbers  of  phosphodiester  bonds  are  con-
served.  One  might  ask,  then,  why  the  reaction  proceeds  at  all.  One
answer  is  that  in  some  cases  the products of the  reactions  are  three
polynucleotides where initially only one plus guanosine existed before.
Together these possess higher entropy than the starting molecules, and
therefore their creation drives the reaction forward.

The transesterification reactions involved in the self-splicing proceed
at rates many orders of magnitude faster than they could with ordinary
transesterifications. Only two reasons can explain the stimulated rate
of these reactions. First, the secondary structure of the molecules can
hold  the  reactive  groups  immediately  adjacent  to  one  another.  This
increases  their  effective  collision  frequencies  far  above  their  normal
solution values. The second reason is that the probability of a reaction
occurring with a collision can be greatly improved if the bonds involved
are strained. Studies with very small self–cutting RNAs and also mo-

A Common Mechanism for Splicing Reactions  137

lecular dynamics calculations indicate that such a strain is crucial to
the reactions. Undoubtedly, self–splicing utilizes both principles.

Self–splicing has been found in two of the messenger RNAs of the
bacteriophage T4, and in the splicing of mRNA in the mitochondrion of
yeast. The mitochondrial self–splicing introns comprise a second group
of self–splicing introns. Their secondary structure differs from those of
the Group I self–splicing introns of which the Tetrahymena rRNA intron
is  an  example.  The  Group  II  introns  do  not  use  a  free  guanosine  to
initiate the splicing process. They use an internal nucleotide, and in this
respect  use  a  reaction  mechanism  more  like  that  used  in  processing
pre–mRNA. The existence of splicing in bacteria and eukaryotes sug-
gests that splicing in general has existed in the common precursor to
both organisms. The scarcity splicing events in prokaryotes might be a
result of the greater number of generations they have had in which to
select for the loss of introns. Eukaryotes may still be struggling with the
“infection.”

A Common Mechanism for Splicing Reactions

One  early difficulty  in  studying  splicing  of  mRNA was obtaining  the
RNA itself. Cells contain large amounts of rRNA, but most of the mRNA
has been processed  by splicing.  Further, only a small fraction of  the
unspliced pre–mRNA present at any moment is from any one gene. One
convenient source of pre-mRNA for use in splicing reactions came from
genetic engineering. The DNA for a segment of a gene containing an
intervening sequence could be placed on a small circular plasmid DNA
molecule  that  could  be  grown  in  the  bacterium  Escherichia  coli  and
easily purified. These circles could be cut at a unique location and then
they could be transcribed in vitro from special phage promoters placed
just  upstream  of the eukaryotic  DNA (Fig.  5.21). By this route, large
quantities of unspliced substrate RNA could be obtained.

Figure 5.22  The two classes of self–splicing RNA and the pathway of nuclear
mRNA splicing, all drawn to emphasize their similarities.

Both  of  the  two  self-splicing  reactions  and  the  snRNP  catalyzed
splicing reactions can be drawn similarly (Fig. 5.22). In the self-splicing
cases a hydroxyl from a guanosine nucleotide or an adenine in the chain
attacks the phosphodiester and a transesterification ensues in which the
5’ end of the RNA is released. For the Group I self-splicing reaction, a
tail is formed, and for the Group II and mRNA splicing reactions, a ring
with a tail is formed. Then a hydroxyl from the end of the 5’ end of the
molecule attacks at the end of the intervening sequence and another
transesterification reaction joins the head and tail exons and releases
the intron.

In the case of pre–mRNA splicing, the same reaction occurs, but it
must be assisted by the snRNP particles. In some intervening sequences
of yeast, internal regions are involved in excision and bear some resem-
blance to portions of the U1 sequences.

The similarities among the splicing reactions suggest that RNA was
the original molecule of life since it can carry out the necessary functions
on  its  own,  and  only  later did  DNA  and  protein  evolve. The  splicing
reactions that now require snRNPs must once have proceeded on their
own.

Other RNA Processing Reactions  139

Other RNA Processing Reactions

The precursor tRNAs in yeast contain an intervening sequence. This is
removed in a more traditional set of enzymatic cleavage and ligation
reactions (Fig. 5.23).

Plant viruses frequently have RNA genomes. These viruses can them-
selves have viruses. These are known as virusoids, and they can grow in
cells only in the presence of a parental virus. Virusoids do not encode
any  proteins,  but  they  are  replicated.  Part  of  their  replication  cycle
requires the specific cleavage of their RNA molecules. This they do in a
self–cutting  reaction.  Symons  and  Uhlenbeck  have  investigated  the

RNA molecules is a simple hairpin.

Earlier  in  the  chapter  editing  reactions  were  mentioned.  Simple
editing of a nucleotide or two has been observed in a mammalian RNA,
but in the mitochondrion of some protozoa far more extensive editing
has been observed. This raises the question of just where the informa-
tion for the editing is stored. Changing a single base can conceivably be
a result of a set of reactions catalyzed by enzymes designed for just the
sequence at which the change occurs, but in the more dramatic exam-
ples of editing, in which more than 50 U’s are inserted to produce the
final  edited  sequences,  far  too  many  different  enzymes would  be  re-
quired. Initial  examinations of the DNA  of  the  organisms,  both with
computer searches of known sequence and hybridization studies, failed
to reveal any sequences that could have encoded the edited sequence.
Eventually it was found that the information for the edited sequences
was  carried  in  short  RNAs  complementary  to  segments  of  the  final
edited sequence. These are called guide sequences. Although cutting and
re-ligation could be the pathway for editing, intermediates in editing are
found that indicate instead, that the guide sequences transfer U’s from
their 3’ ends to the necessary positions in the mRNA by transesterifica-
tion reactions analogous to those used in splicing (Fig. 5.24).

Problems 

5.1. RNA is extracted from cells, hybridized with an excess of genomic
sequence DNA from a particular gene, digested with DNAse S1, and run
on a denaturing gel. What does it mean if Southern transfer and probing

Problems   141

with radioactive fragments from part of the gene yield two radioactive
bands?

5.2. What does possible secondary structure in mRNA (hairpins and
pseudoknots) have to do with the fact that eukaryotes use the bind and
slide mechanism for finding the first AUG of mRNA and this is used to
begin translation, whereas translation of mRNA in prokaryotes begins
at AUG codons which often are not the first occurrence of the codon in
the mRNA?

5.3. Suppose radioactive uridine and rifamycin are simultaneously
added to growing cells. Assume that both the uridine and the rifamycin
instantaneously enter the cells and that the radioactive uridine imme-
diately  begins  entering  RNA  chains  that  are  in  the  process  of  being
elongated.  Messenger  RNA  will  be  completed  and  will  later  decay,
whereas ribosomal RNA will be synthesized and will be stable. Sketch
the kinetics of radioactivity incorporation into RNA in such an experi-
ment and indicate how it may be used to determine the fraction of RNA
synthesis devoted to mRNA and to rRNA.

5.4. How would you go about determining whether rho protein acts
by reading DNA sequences, by reading RNA sequences coming out of
the RNA polymerase, or by interacting directly with RNA polymerase?
5.5. An important question about capped eukaryotic messenger RNA
is whether the cap location is a processing site produced by cleavage
from a longer  RNA or whether  the cap site is the actual start site of
transcription. How could β-labeled ATP be used in vitro to answer this
question for an RNA that begins GpppApXp?

5.6. How could you determine the average physical half-life of mRNA
in cells from data obtained by simultaneously adding radioactive urid-
ine and an inhibitor of the initiation of RNA synthesis?

5.7. Without looking at individual mRNAs, what is a general way to
examine  a  cell  extract  for  the  existence  of  any  Group  I  self–splicing
introns?

5.8. Why is self-cutting and splicing important to the viability of a

virusoid?

5.9. Why should one nucleotide in a lariat possess three phosphodi-

ester bonds, and how would you look for such a nucleotide?

5.10. Why might one wish to include G(5’)ppp(5’)G nucleotides in in
vitro transcription mixtures whose RNA products will be used in splic-
ing reactions?

5.11. The hammerhead self-cutting RNA molecules that are found in
virusoids not only cut RNA. They can ligate once after a cutting step.
Predict  where  the  energy  for  the  ligation  comes  from  subject  to  the
constraints that the hammerhead molecules do not utilize a free nucleo-
tide like the Tetrahymena intron, they don’t use any external molecules
as a source of energy for the ligation, and they do not generate branched
molecules as are found in pre-mRNA splicing reactions.

Protein Structure

6

Proteins carry out most, but not all, of the interesting cellular processes.
Enzymes,  structural  components  of  cells,  and  even  secreted  cellular
adhesives are almost always proteins. One important property shared
by most proteins is their ability to bind molecules selectively. How do
proteins assume their structures and how do these structures give the
proteins such a high degree of selectivity? Many of the principles are
known and are discussed in this chapter.

Ultimately we want to understand proteins so well that we can design
them. That is, our goal is to be able to specify an amino acid sequence
such that, when synthesized, it will assume a desired three-dimensional
structure, bind any desired substrate, and then carry out any reasonable
enzymatic  reaction.  Furthermore,  if  our  designed  protein  is  to  be
synthesized  in  cells,  we  must  know  what  necessary  auxiliary  DNA
sequences to provide so that the protein will be synthesized in the proper
quantities and at appropriate times.

The most notable advances of molecular biology in the 1980s involved
nucleic acids, not proteins. Nonetheless, since DNA specifies the amino
acid sequence  of proteins,  our  ability to synthesize DNA of arbitrary
sequence and put it back into cells means that the amino acid sequences
of proteins can also be specifically altered. Consequently, the pace of
research investigating protein structure dramatically increased around
1990. Systematic studies of the structure and activity of proteins result-
ing from specific amino acid substitutions are now increasing greatly
our understanding of protein structure and function.

In this chapter we examine the fundamentals of protein structure.
Much of this information is discussed more completely in biochemistry
or physical biochemistry texts. We review the material here to develop
our intuitions on the structures and properties of proteins so as to have
a clearer feel for how cells function. First we discuss the components of

149

150  Protein Structure

proteins, the amino acids. Then we consider the consequences of the
linking of amino acids via peptide bonds.

A variety of forces are possible between amino acids. Their origins
are discussed and explained. These include electrostatic forces, disper-
sion forces, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic forces. These forces plus
steric  constraints  lead  the  amino  acids  along  many  portions  of  the
polypeptide  backbone  to  adopt,  to  a  first  approximation,  relatively
simple,  specific  orientations known  as  alpha-helices, beta-sheets and
beta bends. Motifs within proteins are recognizable structural elements.
The structures of a number of DNA-binding motifs will be discussed.
Independent folding units of proteins are called domains, and these will
also be covered. Finally, physical methods that can be used to determine
the identity and strength of specific amino acid residue-base interac-
tions of DNA-binding proteins will be covered.

The Amino Acids

Proteins consist of α-L-amino acids linked by peptide bonds to form
polypeptide chains (Fig. 6.1). At neutral pH, the carboxyl group of a free
amino  acid  is  negatively  charged  and  the  amino  group  is  positively
charged.  In  a  protein,  however,  these  charges  are  largely,  but  not
completely absent from the interior amino acids owing to the formation
of the peptide bonds between the amino groups and carboxyl groups.
Of course, the N-terminal amino group of a protein is positively charged
and the C-terminal carboxyl group is negatively charged.

Twenty different types of α-L-amino acids are commonly found in
proteins  (Fig.  6.2).  Except for  proline, which  technically  is  an  imino
acid, these differ from one another only in the structure of the side group
attached  to  the  alpha  carbon.  A  few  other  types  of  amino  acids  are
occasionally found in proteins, with most resulting from modification
of one of the twenty after the protein has been synthesized. Frequently
these modified amino acids are directly involved with chemical reac-
tions catalyzed by the protein. Each of the basic twenty must possess
unique and invaluable properties since most proteins contain all twenty
different amino acids (Table 6.1).

Even though we must understand the individual properties of each
of the amino acids, it is convenient to classify the twenty into a smaller

positive charge on the amino group and three amino acids linked by peptide
bonds.

One of the most important such groups is the hydrophobics. The side

to a similar hydrophobic patch on the surface of another protein, as in
the  oligomerization  of  protein  subunits,  or  it  can  make  the  protein
prefer to bind to or even enter a membrane. Hydrophobic amino acids
on the interior of a protein prefer the company of one another to the
exclusion of water. This is one of the major forces that maintains the
structure of a folded protein.

The  basic  amino  acid  side  groups  of  amino  acids  like  lysine  and
arginine possess a positive charge at neutral pH. If located on the surface
of the protein, such positive charges can assist the binding of a nega-
tively  charged  ligand,  for  example  DNA.  The  acidic  amino  acid  side
groups of glutamic acid and aspartic acid possess a negative charge at
neutral pH. Neutral amino acid side groups possess no net charge, and

polar amino acid side groups possess separated charges like those found
on glutamine. Separated charges lead to dipole interactions with other
amino acids or with ligands binding to the protein.

Cysteine is a notable unique amino acid since in an oxidizing extracel-
lular environment, but not in the intracellular environment, two cyste-
ine  residues  in a  protein can spontaneously  oxidize to  form a rather
stable disulfide bond (Fig. 6.3). In the isolated protein, this bond can be
reduced by the presence of an excess of a reducing reagent to regenerate
cysteines.

The Peptide Bond  

A peptide bond links successive amino acids in a polypeptide chain. The
mere linking of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain, however, is
insufficient to ensure that the joined amino acids will adopt a particular
three-dimensional structure. The peptide bond possesses two extraor-
dinarily important properties that facilitate folding of a polypeptide into
a particular structure.

First, as a consequence of the partial double-bond character of the
peptide  bond  between  the  carbonyl  carbon  and  nitrogen,  the  unit

bounded by the alpha carbon atoms of two successive amino acids is
constrained to lie in a plane. Therefore, energy need not be consumed
from other interactions to generate the “proper” orientation about the
C-N bond in each amino acid. Rotation is possible about each of the two
peptide backbone bonds from the Cα atom of each amino acid (Fig. 6.4).
Angles of rotation about these two bonds are called φ and ψ, and their
specification for each of the amino acids in a polypeptide completely
describes  the  path  of  the  polypeptide  backbone.  Of  course,  the  side
chains of the amino acids are free to rotate and may adopt a number of
conformations so that the φ and ψ angles do not completely specify the
structure of a protein.

The  second  consequence  of  the  peptide  bond  is  that  the  amide
hydrogen from one amino acid may be shared with the carbonyl oxygen
from another amino acid in a hydrogen bond. Since each amino acid in

in a polypeptide. Due to their positions on the amino acids these bonds
have to be between different amino acids in the protein. Therefore they
provide many stabilizing and structure-forming interactions. Although
the individual hydrogen bonds are weak, the large number that can form
in a protein contributes substantially to maintaining the three-dimen-
sional structure of a protein.

Electrostatic Forces that Determine Protein Structure

Proteins have a difficult time surviving. If we heat them a little above
the  temperatures  normally  found  in  the  cells  from  which  they  are
isolated, most are denatured. Why should this be? On first consideration
it would make sense for proteins to be particularly stable and to be able
to withstand certain environmental insults like mild heating. One expla-
nation  for  the  instability  is  that  proteins  just  cannot  be  made  more
stable. A second possibility is that the instability is an inherent part of
proteins’ activities. This latter possibility seems more likely since en-
zymes  extracted  from  bacteria  that  thrive  at  temperatures  near  the
boiling point of water frequently are inactive at temperatures below 40°.
It could be that to act as catalysts in chemical reactions or to participate
in other cellular activities, proteins must be flexible, and such flexibility
means  that  proteins  must  exist  on  the  verge  of  denaturing.  A  final
possibility is that rapid fluctuations in structure of the folding interme-
diates are necessary for a protein to find the correct folded conforma-
tion. The existence of such meta-stable states may preclude the existence
of a highly stable folded state. Future research should illuminate this

question. For the present, we will examine the origins of the weak forces
that barely manage to give proteins specific shapes.

Often it is helpful to think of the interactions between amino acids in
terms of forces. In some cases, physicists and physical chemists have
also found it convenient to consider the interactions between objects in
terms  of  potentials  (Fig.  6.5).  Some  of  our  discussion  will  be  more
streamlined if we, also, use potentials. Forces and potentials are easily
interconvertible since forces are simply related to potentials. The steep-
ness of an object’s potential at a point is proportional to the force on the
object while at that point,

Alternatively,  the  potential  difference  between  two  points  is  propor-
tional to the work required to move an object between the two points.

Figure 6.7  An electrical dipole and the potential generated at a distance r from
the dipole. Angular dependencies have been ignored.

Electrostatics  are the basis  of  several  of  the  forces  that determine
protein structure. Charges of unlike sign attract each other with a force
proportional to each of the charges and inversely proportional to the
square of the charge separation (Fig. 6.6). The force is also inversely
proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium, but for purposes
of our discussion, this factor will not be considered. Thus, the potential
generated at a point by a charge is proportional to the magnitude of the
charge and inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the

The electric field at a point is defined as the force a unit charge would

Since both positively and negatively charged amino acids exist, direct
electrostatic attractions are possible in proteins. These generate what
are called salt bridges. A number of proteins contain such salt bridges.
When two equal and opposite charges or partial charges are located
near  one  another,  as  is  found  in  the  polar  amino  acids  and  in  each
peptide bond, it is convenient to view their combined effect on other
atoms and molecules as a whole rather than considering each charge
individually. A dipole with charges +Q and -Q separated by a distance l
(Fig. 6.7) generates a potential and electric field proportional to

Interactions between pairs of dipoles are also common in proteins. By
the same reasoning as used above, the potential between the two dipoles
ql and QL can be shown to be proportional to

.

Even  more  important  to  protein  structure  and  function  than  the
interactions between permanent dipoles in proteins are the momentary
interactions  between  temporary  dipoles  that  have  been  created  by  a
brief fluctuation in the positions of charges. The forces generated by
interactions between such dipoles are called London dispersion forces.
They are weak, short-ranged, up to an Angstrom or two, attractive forces
that exist between all molecules. These form the basis of most of the
selectivity in the binding of other molecules to proteins. If the shapes of
a protein and another molecule are complementary, then many of these
attractive forces can act and hold the two molecules tightly together. If

the shapes are not exactly complementary, then because the forces are
short-ranged, only the small areas in contact are subject to dispersion
attractive  forces  and  the  two  molecules  do  not  strongly  bind  to  one
another.

Dispersion forces are particularly short-ranged since their attractive
potential falls off with the sixth power of the distance separating the
molecules. Although these forces are best understood in the framework
of quantum mechanics, we can understand the origin of the sixth-power
dependence. Consider an electrically neutral nonpolar molecule. Ther-
mal fluctuations can generate a momentary separation of its plus and

The  electric  field  produced  by  this  dipole  can  induce  a  dipole  in  an
adjacent  susceptible  molecule.  The  strength  of  the  induced  dipole  is

directly proportional to the strength of the local electric field. That is,
the induced dipole has a strength, D2, proportional to

Since,  as  discussed  above,  the  potential  between  two  dipoles  is
proportional to the product of their strength and inversely proportional
to the cube of their separation,

ϕ  =

.

Substituting the value for D2 in the potential yields the result that the
potential between the two dipoles is inversely proportional to the sixth

Due  to  the  inverse  sixth-power  dependence,  the  dispersion  forces
become  much  stronger  as  the  distance separating  two molecules be-
comes smaller. The force cannot become too great, for once the elec-
tronic cloud of one molecule begins to interpenetrate the cloud of the
other molecule, a very strong repulsive interaction sets in. It is compu -
tationally  convenient  to  approximate  this  repulsive  potential  as  an
inverse twelfth power of the separation of the centers of the atoms. The
combination of the two potentials is known as a Van der Waals potential.
The radius at which the strong repulsion begins to be significant is the
Van der Waals radius (Fig. 6.8).

Hydrogen Bonds and the Chelate Effect

A hydrogen atom shared by two other atoms generates a hydrogen bond.
This sharing is energetically most important when the three atoms are
in  a  straight  line  and  the  atom  to  which  the  hydrogen  is  covalently
bonded, the hydrogen bond donor, possesses a partial negative charge

and the partner atom, a hydrogen bond acceptor, also possesses a partial
negative charge. Then the atoms may approach each other quite closely
and the electrostatic attractive forces and the dispersion forces will be
appreciable. Since the amide of the peptide bond can be a hydrogen
donor, and the carboxyl can be a hydrogen acceptor, proteins have a
potential for forming a great many hydrogen bonds. In addition, more
than  half  the  side  groups  of  the  amino  acids  usually  participate  in
hydrogen bonding.

A paradox is generated by the existence of hydrogen bonds in pro-
teins. Studies with model compounds show that a hydrogen bond to
water should be stronger than a hydrogen bond between amino acids.
Why then don’t proteins denature and make all their hydrogen bonds to
water? A part of the answer is the chelate effect. That is, two objects
appear to bind to one another far more strongly if something else holds
them in the correct binding positions than if their own attractive forces
must correctly position the objects. In a protein with a structure that
holds amino acids in position, any single bond between amino acids
within  the  protein  is  entropically  more  favorable  than  altering  the
structure of the protein and making the bond to water. Another way of
looking at this is that the formation of one hydrogen bond holds other
amino acids in position so that they may more easily form hydrogen
bonds themselves.

The chelate effect is important in understanding many phenomena
of molecular biology. A different example, explained more fully later,
concerns proteins. Much of the work required for two macromolecules
to  bind  to  one  another  is  correctly  positioning  and  orienting  them.
Consider the binding of a protein to DNA. If the protein and DNA have
been  correctly  positioned  and  oriented,  then  all  of  their  interaction
energy can go into holding the two together. In the binding of a dimeric
protein to DNA, once the first subunit has bound, the second subunit is
automatically positioned and oriented correctly. Therefore the second
subunit appears to have the larger effect in binding the protein to DNA
than the first one. Equivalently, the dimer appears to bind more tightly
than  would  be  predicted  by  simply  doubling  the  ∆G  of  the  binding
reaction of the monomer.

Hydrophobic Forces

The structures of the many proteins that have been determined by X-ray
diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance reveal that, in general, the
polar and charged amino acids tend to be found on the surface and the
aliphatic  amino  acids  tend  to  be  found  in  the  interior.  Hydrophobic

forces make aliphatic amino acids try to escape from a water environ-
ment and to cluster together in the center of a protein away from water.
The  precise  definition  of  hydrophobic  force  and  methods  of  its
measurement  are  currently  under  rapid  development.  One  way  of
considering  the  phenomenon  begins  by  considering  the  energy  and
entropy change in moving a neutral, nonpolar amino acid out of the
interior of a protein and into the surrounding water (Fig. 6.9). The entry
of a hydrocarbon into water facilitates the formation of structured cages
of water molecules around the hydrocarbon molecule. These surround
the hydrocarbon but do not significantly interact with it. The energy of
formation of these structures actually favors their generation, but the
translational and rotational  entropy loss required to form the struc-
tured water cages inhibits their production. From considerations at this
level, we cannot deduce the magnitude of the effects. Those are deter-
mined by measuring the relative solubility of different hydrocarbons in
water and organic solvents at various temperatures. The results show
that the state of the system in which these cages are absent, that is, with
the nonpolar amino acids in the interior of the protein, is more probable
than the state in which they are present on the protein’s surface.

Hydrophobic forces can be expected to be strongest at some interme-
diate temperature between freezing and boiling. Near freezing tempera-
tures, the water throughout the solution becomes more structured, and
thus there is little difference between the status of a water molecule in
solution or a water molecule in a cage around a hydrophobic group.
Alternatively, at high temperatures, little of the water around a hydro-
phobic group can be be structured. It is melted out of structure. The
difference between water around a hydrophobic group and water else-
where in the solution is maximized at some intermediate temperature.
As  this  difference  is  important  to  protein  structure,  some  proteins
possess  maximum  stability  at  intermediate  temperatures.  A  few  are
actually denatured upon cooling. A more common manifestation of the
hydrophobic  forces  is  the  fact  that  some  polymeric  structures  are
destabilized  by  cooling  and  depolymerize  because  the  hydrophobic
forces holding them together are weaker at lower temperatures.

Thermodynamic Considerations of Protein Structure  161

Thermodynamic Considerations of Protein Structure

Thermodynamics provides a useful framework for calculation of equi-
librium  constants  of  reactions.  This  also  applies  to  the  “reaction”  of
protein  denaturation.  Consider  a  protein  denaturing  from  a  specific
native conformation, N, to any of a great many nonspecific, random
conformations characteristic of denatured proteins, D. The reaction can
be described by an equilibrium constant that relates the amount of the
protein  found  in  each  of  the  two  states  if  the  system  has  reached
equilibrium,

N  →←  D
Keq  =  D
N

 

.

Thermodynamics provides a way of calculating Keq as 

K  =  e−∆G⁄RT

=  e−(∆H  −  T∆S)⁄RT

where ∆G  is  the  change  in  Gibbs  free  energy;  R  is  the  universal  gas
constant;  T  is  the  absolute  temperature  in  degrees  Kelvin; ∆H  is  the
enthalpy change of the reaction, which in biological systems is equiva-
lent to binding energy when volume changes can be neglected; and  ∆S
is the entropy change of the reaction. Entropy is related to the number
of equivalent states of a system. The state of a protein molecule confined
to one conformation without any degrees of freedom possesses much
lower entropy than a denatured protein that can adopt any of a great
number of conformations all at the same energy. For clarity, we will
neglect the contributions of the surrounding water in further considera-
tions,  but  in  physically  meaningful  calculations  these  too  must  be
included.

Let  us  examine  why  proteins  denature  when  the  temperature  is
raised. If the protein is in the folded state at the lower temperature, Keq
is less than 1, that is, 

−∆G
RT

  <  0  

  −∆H  +  T∆S  <  0 ,

 

 

∆H  >  T∆S.

As the temperature increases, neglecting the small temperature-depend-
ent changes that occur in the interaction energies and entropy change,
the term T∆S increases, and eventually exceeds ∆H. Then the equilib-
rium shifts to favor the denatured state.

The temperature dependence of the denaturing of proteins provides
the information necessary for determination of ∆Η of denaturing. It is
very large! This means that ∆S for denaturing is also very large, just as
we inferred above, and at temperatures near the denaturing point, the

162  Protein Structure

difference  of  these  two  large  numbers  barely  favors  retention  of  the
structure  of  the  protein.  Hence  the  binding  energies  of  the  many
interactions  that  determine  protein  structure,  hydrogen  bonds,  salt
bridges, dipole-dipole interactions, dispersion forces, and hydrophobic
forces just barely overcome the disruptive forces. Thus we see the value
of  the  peptide  bond.  If  rotations  about  the  C-N  bond  were  not  re-
stricted,the increased degrees of freedom available to the protein would
be enormous. Then the energy and entropy balance would be tipped in
the direction of denatured proteins.

Structures within Proteins

It is useful to focus attention on particular aspects of protein structures.
The primary structure of a protein is its linear sequence of amino acids.
The  local  spatial  structure  of  small  numbers  of  amino  acids,  inde-
pendent of the orientations of their side groups, generates a secondary
structure. The alpha helix, beta sheet, and beta turn are all secondary
structures that have been found in proteins. Both the arrangement of
the secondary structure elements and the spatial arrangement of all the
atoms of the molecule are referred to as the tertiary structure. Quater-
nary structure refers to the arrangement of subunits in proteins consist-
ing of more than one polypeptide chain.

A domain of a protein is a structure unit intermediate in size between
secondary and tertiary structures. It is a local group of amino acids that
have many fewer interactions with other portions of the protein than
they  have  among  themselves  (Fig.  6.10).  Consequently,  domains  are
independent folding units. Interestingly, not only are the amino acids
of a domain near one another in the tertiary structure of a protein, but
they  usually  comprise  amino  acids  that  lie  near  one  another  in  the
primary structure as well. Often, therefore, study of a protein’s structure
can be done on a domain-by-domain basis. The existence of semi-inde-
pendent domains should  greatly  facilitate  the  study of the folding of
polypeptide chains and the prediction of folding pathways and struc-
tures.

Particularly  useful  to  the  ultimate  goal  of  prediction  of  protein
structure has been the finding that many alterations in the structure of
proteins produced by changing amino acids tend to be local. This has

been found in exhaustive genetic studies of the lac and lambda phage
repressors, in the thermodynamic properties of mutant proteins, and in
the actual X-ray or NMR determined structures of a number of proteins.
In the lac and lambda repressors, the majority of the amino acid changes
that alter the ability to bind to DNA lie in the portion of the protein that
makes  contact  with  the  DNA.  Similar  results  can  be  inferred  from
alterations  in  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  the  tryptophan  synthetase
protein generated by fusing two related but nonidentical genes. Despite
appreciable amino acid sequence differences in the two parental types,
the fusions that contain various amounts of the N-terminal sequence
from one of the proteins and the remainder of the sequence from the
other protein retain enzymatic activity (Fig. 6.11). This means that the
amino acid alterations generated by formation of these chimeric pro-
teins do not need to be compensated by special amino acid changes at
distant points in the protein.

The  results  obtained  with  repressors  and  tryptophan  synthetase
mean that a change of an amino acid often produces a change in the
tertiary structure that is primarily confined to the immediate vicinity of
the  alteration.  This,  plus  the  finding  that  protein  structures  can  be
broken down into domains, means that many of the potential long-range
interactions  between  amino  acids  can  be  neglected  and  interactions
over  relatively  short  distances  of  up  to  10  Å  play  the  major  role  in
determining protein structure.

The proteins that bind to enhancer sequences in eukaryotic cells are
a particularly dramatic example of domain structures in proteins. These
proteins  bind  to  the  enhancer  DNA  sequence,  often  bind  to  small
molecule growth regulators, and activate transcription. In the glucocor-
ticoid  receptor  protein,  any  of  these  three  domains  may  be  inde-
pendently inactivated without affecting the other two. Further, domains
may be interchanged between enhancer proteins so that the DNA-bind-
ing specificity of one such protein can be altered by replacement with
the DNA-binding domain from another protein.

As we saw earlier in discussing mRNA splicing, DNA regions encod-
ing different domains of a protein can be appreciably separated on the
chromosome. This permits different domains of proteins to be shuffled

164  Protein Structure

so as to accelerate the rate of evolution by building new proteins from
new assortments of preexisting protein domains. Domains rather than
amino acids then become building blocks in protein evolution.

The Alpha Helix, Beta Sheet, and Beta Turn

The existence of the alpha helix was predicted by Pauling and Cory from
careful structural studies of amino acids and peptide bonds. This pre-
diction came before identification of the alpha helix in X-ray diffraction
patterns of proteins. Even though the data were all there, it was over-
looked. The alpha helix is found in most proteins and is a fundamental
structural  element.  In  the  alpha  helix,  hydrogen  bonds  are  formed
between  the  carbonyl  oxygen  of  one  peptide  bond  and  the  amide
hydrogen of the amino acid located three and a third amino acids away.

The side chains of the amino acids extend outward from the helix, and
the hydrogen bonds are nearly parallel to the helix axis (Fig. 6.12). If
they were precisely parallel to the axis, the helix pitch would be 3.33
amino acids per turn, but due to steric constraints, the hydrogen bonds
are somewhat skewed, and the average pitch is found to be 3.6 to 3.7
amino acids per turn.

If we look down the axis of an alpha helix, we see the amino acids
winding around in a circle. Every third and then every fourth amino
acid lies on one side of the helix (Fig. 6.13). This pattern follows from
the fact that the alpha helix is nearly 3.5 amino acids per turn. If every
third  and then every fourth  amino  acid were hydrophobic, two  such
helices could bind together through their parallel strips of hydrophobic
amino  acids.  This  occurs  in  structures  called  coiled  coils.  These  are
found in structural proteins like myosin as well as in a class of transcrip-
tional regulators that dimerize by these interactions. These activators
are called leucine-zipper proteins. They possess leucine residues seven
amino acids apart. Strips of hydrophobic amino acids along one face of
alpha helices are frequently found in bundles containing two, three, or
four alpha helices.

The beta-strand is a second important structural element of proteins.
In it the polypeptide chains are quite extended (Fig. 6.14). From a top

view the peptide backbone is relatively straight, but in a side view the
peptide  backbone  is  pleated.  The  side  chains  of  the  amino  acids are
relatively unconstrained since alternate groups are directed straight up
and straight down. The amide hydrogens and the carboxyl groups are
directed to either side and are available for hydrogen bonding to another
beta-strand lying alongside to form a beta sheet. This second strand can
be oriented either parallel or antiparallel to the first.

The third readily identified secondary structural element is the re-
verse or beta bend (Fig. 6.15). A polypeptide chain must reverse direc-
tion  many  times  in  a  typical  globular  protein.  The  beta  bend  is  an
energy-effective method of accomplishing this goal. Three amino acids
often are involved in a reverse bend.

Calculation of Protein Tertiary Structure

The sequence of amino acids in a protein and the environment of the
protein usually determines the structure of the protein. That is, most
proteins are capable of folding to their correct conformations without
the assistance of any folding enzymes. This is known from the fact that
many proteins can be denatured by heat or the addition of 6 M urea and
will renature if slowly returned to nondenaturing conditions. Since the
sequence is sufficient to determine structure, can we predict the struc-
ture? The correct folding of some proteins, however, appears to require
the assistance of auxiliary proteins called chaperonins.

We can imagine several basic approaches to the prediction of protein
structure. The first is simply to consider the free energy of every possible
conformation of the protein. We might expect that the desired structure
of  the  protein  would  be  the  conformation  with  the  lowest  potential
energy. The approach of calculating energies of all possible conforma-
tions possesses a serious flaw. Computationally, it is completely infea-
sible since a typical protein of 200 amino acids has 400 bonds along the
peptide backbone about which  rotations are possible. If we consider
each 36° of rotation about each such bond in the protein to be a new
state, there  are 10  states  per bond, or  10400 different  conformational
states  of  the  protein.  With  about  1080  particles  in  the  universe,  a

lation  of  conformation,  a  calculation
seeking  an  energy  minimum  might  be-
come  trapped  in  state  1,  when,  in  fact,
state 2 is the correct conformation.

a unit of speed measure of computers), an age of the universe of roughly
1018  seconds,  with  one  superfast  computer  for  each  particle  in  the
universe and beginning to  calculate at the  origin of the universe, we
would have had time to list, let alone calculate the energy of, only an
infinitesimal fraction of the possible states of one protein.

The preceding example is known as the Levinthal paradox. It illus-
trates  two  facts.  First,  that  we  cannot  expect  to  predict  the  folded
structure of a protein by examining each possible conformation. Sec-
ond, it seems highly unlikely that proteins sample each possible confor-
mational state either. More likely they follow a folding pathway in which
at any moment the number of accessible conformations is highly lim-
ited. We can try to fold a protein by an analogous method.This can be
done by varying, individually, the structure variables like angles. As long
as changing an angle or distance in one direction continues to lower the
total energy of the system, movement in this direction is permitted to
continue.  When  minima  have  been  found  for  all  the  variables,  the
protein  ought  to  be  in  a  state  of  lowest  energy.  Unfortunately,  the
potential  energy  surface  of  proteins  does  not  contain  just  one  local
minimum.  Many  exist.  Thus,  when  the  protein  has  “fallen”  into  a
potential energy well, it is very unlikely to be in the deepest well (Fig.
6.16).  This  energy  minimization  approach has  no  convenient way  to
escape from a well and sample other conformation states so as to find
the deepest well. One approach to avoiding this problem might be to try
to fold the protein by starting at its N-terminus by analogy to the way
natural proteins are synthesized. Unfortunately, this does not help much
in avoiding local mimima or achieving the correct structures.

Yet a third way for us to calculate structure might be to mimic what
a  protein  does.  Suppose  we  calculate  the  motion  of  each  atom  in  a
protein simply by making use of Newton’s law of motion 

F  =  ma.

From chemistry we know the various forces pushing and pulling on an
atom  in  a  molecule. These  are the result  of stretching,  bending, and
twisting ordinary chemical bonds, plus the dispersion forces or Van der
Waals forces we discussed earlier, electrical forces, and finally hydrogen
bonds to other atoms. Of course, we cannot solve the resulting equations
analytically as we do in some physics courses for particularly simple
idealized problems. Solving has to be done numerically. At one instant

168  Protein Structure

positions  and  velocities  are  assumed  for  each  atom  in  the  structure.
From  the  velocities  we  can  calculate  where  each  atom  will  be  10-14
second later. From the potentials we can calculate the average forces
acting  on  each  atom  during  this  interval.  These  alter  the  velocities
according to Newton’s law, and at the new positions of each atom, we
adjust the velocities accordingly and proceed through another round of
calculations. This is done repeatedly so that the structure of the protein
develops in segments of 10-14 second. The presence of local minima in
the potential energy function is not too serious for protein dynamics
calculations since the energies of the vibrations are sufficient to jump
out of the local minima.

be handled by large computers. These calculations take many hours on
the largest computers and can simulate the motions of a protein only
for times up to 10 to 100 picoseconds. This interval is insufficient to
model the folding of a protein or even to examine many of the interesting
questions of protein structure. 

Another useful approach with molecular dynamics is to begin with
the coordinates of a protein derived from X-ray crystallography. Each
of the atoms is then given a random velocity appropriate to the tempera-
ture being simulated. Soon after the start of the  calculations, the protein
settles  down  and  vibrates  roughly  as  expected  from  general  physics
principles. During the course of such simulations the total energy in the
system ought to remain constant, and the calculations are done with
sufficient accuracy that this constraint is satisfied. The vibrations seen
in these simulations can be as large as several angstroms. Frequently
sizeable portions of the protein engage in cooperative vibrations.

Secondary Structure Predictions

Less  ambitious  than  calculating  the tertiary  structure  of  a  protein  is
predicting  its  secondary  structure.  There  is  some  hope  that  this  is  a
much  simpler  problem  than  prediction  of  tertiary  structure  because
most of the interactions determining secondary structure at an amino
acid residue derive from amino acids close by in the primary sequence.
The problem is how many amino acids need to be considered and how
likely is a prediction to be correct? We can estimate both by utilizing
information from proteins whose structures are known. The question is
how long a stretch of amino acids is required to specify a secondary
structure. For example, if a stretch of five amino acids were sufficient,

Secondary Structure Predictions  169

then the same sequence of five amino acids ought to adopt the same
structure, regardless of the protein in which they occur.

 The tertiary structures available from X-ray diffraction studies can
be used as input data. Many examples now exist where a sequence of
five amino acids appears in more than one protein. In about 60% of
these cases, the same sequence of five amino acids is found in the same
secondary  structure.  Of  course,  not  all  possible  five  amino  acid  se-
quences are represented in the sample set, but the set is sufficiently large
that it is clear that we should not expect to have better than about 60%
accuracy in any secondary structure prediction scheme if we consider
only five amino acids at a time.

Several approaches have been used to determine secondary structure
prediction rules. At one end is a scheme based on the known conforma-
tions assumed by homopolymers and extended by analysis of a small
number of known protein structures. The Chou and Fasman approach
is in this category. A more general approach is to use information theory
to generate a defined algorithm for predicting secondary structure. This
overcomes  many  of  the  ambiguities  of  the  Chou-Fasman  prediction
scheme.

Recently, neural networks have been applied to predicting secondary
structure.  While  usually  implemented  on  ordinary  computers,  these
simulate  on  a  crude  scale  some  of  the  known  properties  of  neural
connections in parts of the brain. Depending on the sum of the positive
and negative inputs, a neuron either does not fire, or fires and sends
activating and inhibiting signals on to the  neurons its output is con-
nected to.

In predicting secondary structure by a neural network, the input is
the identity of each amino acid in a stretch of ten to fifteen amino acids
(Fig. 6.17). Since each of these can be any of the twenty amino acids,
about  200  input  lines  or  “neurons”  are  on  this  layer.  Each  of  these
activates or inhibits each neuron on a second layer by a strength that is
adjusted by training. After summing the positive and negative signals
reaching it, a neuron on the second layer either tends to “fire” and sends
a strong activating or inhibiting signal on to the third layer, or it tends
not to fire. In the case of protein structure prediction, there would be
three neurons in the third layer. One corresponds to predicting α-helix,
one to β-sheet, and one to random coil. For a given input sequence, the
network’s secondary structure prediction for the central amino acid of

the sequence is considered to correspond to the neuron of the third layer
with  the  highest  output value.  “Training” such a network  is done by
presenting various stretches of amino acids whose secondary structure
is known and adjusting the strengths of the interactions between neu-
rons so that the network predicts the structures correctly.

No matter what scheme is used, the accuracy of the resulting struc-
ture prediction rules never exceeds about 65%. Note that a scheme with
no predictive powers whatsoever would be correct for about 33% of the
amino acids in a protein. The failure of these approaches to do better
than 65% means that in some cases, longer-range interactions between
amino acids in a protein have a significant effect in determining secon-
dary structure (See problem 6.18).

Structures of DNA-Binding Proteins

A protein that regulates the expression of a gene most often recognizes
and  binds  to  a  specific  DNA  sequence  in  the  vicinity  of  that  gene.
Bacteria contain at least several thousand different genes, and most are
likely  to  be  regulated.  Eukaryotic  cells  contain  at  least  10,000  and
perhaps as many as 50,000 different regulated genes. Although combi-
natorial tricks could be used to reduce the number of regulatory proteins
well below the total number of genes, it seems likely that cells contain
at  least  several  thousand  different  proteins  that  bind  to  specific  se-
quences. What must the structure of a protein be in order that it bind
with high specificity to one or a few particular sequences of DNA? Does
nature use more than one basic protein structure for binding to DNA
sequences?

Chapter 2 discussed the structure of DNA and pointed out that the
sequence of DNA can be read by hydrogen bonding to groups within the
major  groove  without  melting  the  DNA’s  double-stranded  structure.
Each  of  the  four  base  pair  combinations,  A-T,  T-A,  G-C,  and  C-G,

generates  a  unique  pattern  of  hydrogen  bond  donors  and  acceptors.
Therefore, the identity of a base pair can be read by a single, properly
positioned,  amino  acid.  Of  course,  an  amino  acid  need  not  be  con-
strained to bond only to a single base pair or just to the hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors in the major groove. Bonding from an amino acid
residue is also possible to multiple base pairs, to the deoxyribose rings,
or the phosphate groups.

Since  the  width  of  the  major  groove  of  DNA  nicely  accepts  an
alpha-helix,  it  seems  likely  that  such  helices  play  a  major  role  in
DNA-binding proteins, and this has been found. We might also expect
proteins to maximize  their  sequence  selectivity by constructing their
recognition surfaces to be as rigid as possible. If the surface is held in
the correct shape while the protein is free in solution, then none of the
protein-DNA  binding  energy  needs  to  be  consumed  in  freezing  the
surface  in  the  correct  shape.  All  the  interaction  energy  between  the
protein and DNA can go into holding the protein on the DNA and none
needs  to  be  spent  holding  the  protein  in  the  correct  conformation.
Further, the DNA-contacting surface must protrude from the protein in
order to reach into the major groove of the DNA. These considerations
lead to the idea that proteins may utilize special mechanisms to stiffen
their DNA-binding domains, and indeed, this expectation is also met.

The high interest and importance in gene regulatory proteins means
that  a  number  have  been  purified  and  carefully  studied.  Sequence
analysis and structure determination have revealed four main families
of DNA-binding domains. These are the helix-turn-helix, zinc domain,
leucine zipper, and the beta-ribbon proteins. 

The helix-turn-helix domains possess a short loop of four amino acids
between  the  two  helical  regions  (Fig.  6.18).  Because  the  connection
between  the  helices  is  short  and  the  helices  partially  lie  across  one
another, they form a rigid structure stabilized by hydrophobic interac-

172  Protein Structure

tions between the helices. For historical reasons the first of these two
helices is called Helix 2, and the following helix is called Helix 3. In these
proteins  Helix  3  lies  within  the  major  groove  of  the  DNA,  but  its
orientation within the groove varies from one DNA-binding protein to
another. In some, the helix lies rather parallel to the major groove, but
in  others,  the  helix  sticks  more  end-on  into  the  groove.  The  actual
positioning of the helix in the groove is determined by contacts between
the protein and phosphate groups, sugar groups, and more distal parts
of the protein. Contacts between the protein and DNA need not be direct.
Trp  repressor  makes  a  substantial  number  of  contacts  indirectly  via
water  molecules.  Most  prokaryotic  helix-turn-helix  proteins  are  ho-
modimeric,  and  they  therefore  bind  a  repeated  sequence.  Since  the
subunits face one another, the repeats are inverted, and form a symmet-
rical sequence, for example AAAGGG-CCCTTT. Developmental genes in
eukaryotes often are regulated by proteins that are a close relative of the
helix-turn-helix  protein.  These  homeodomain  proteins  possess  struc-
tures highly similar to the helix-turn-helix structures, but either of the
helices may be longer  than their prokaryotic analogs. The homeodo-
main proteins usually are monomeric and therefore bind to asymmetric
sequences.

C

Zn++

N

The  zinc  finger  proteins  are  the  most  prominent  members  of  the
zinc-containing proteins that bind to DNA. The zinc finger is a domain
of  25  to  30  amino  acids  consisting  of  a  12  residue  helix  and  two
beta-ribbons packed against one another. In these proteins, Zn ligands
to four amino acids and forms a stiffening cross-bridge. Often the Zn is
held by two cysteines at the ends of the ribbons beside the turn, and by
two histidines in the alpha-helix. This unit fits into the major groove of
the DNA and contacts three base pairs. Usually these Zn-finger proteins

Salt Effects on Protein-DNA Interactions  173

per protein binding to DNA.

contain multiple fingers, and the next finger can contact the following
three base pairs. Other Zn-containing proteins that bind to DNA contain
multiple Zn ions in more complex structures. These proteins also use
residues in the alpha-helix and at its end to contact the DNA. Zn fingers
can also be used to make sequence-specific contacts to RNA.

The leucine zipper proteins are of a particularly simple design. They
contain two alpha-helical polypeptides dimerized by hydrophobic faces
on each. Characteristically, each polypeptide contains leucine residues
seven amino acids apart that form the dimerization faces. Beyond the
dimerization domains the helices diverge as in a “Y”, with each arm
passing through a major groove (Fig. 6.19). Few leucine zipper proteins
have been identified in prokaryotes, but they are common in eukaryotes.
They  are  notable  in  forming  heterodimers.  For  example,  the  fos-jun
transcription factor  is a leucine  zipper protein.  It is  easy to  see how
specific dimerization could be determined by patterns of positive and
negative  charges  near  the  contact  regions  of  the  two  dimerization
regions.

The beta-sheet domains contact either the major or minor groove of
DNA via two antiparallel beta-strands. A few prokaryotic and eukaryotic
examples of these proteins are known, the most notable being the X-ray
determined structure of the MetJ repressor-operator complex. At least
part of the DNA contacts made by transcription factor TFIID are in the
minor groove and are made by such beta-strands. 

Salt Effects on Protein-DNA Interactions

Many  of  the  macromolecular  interactions  of  interest  in  molecular
biology involve the binding of proteins to DNA. Experiments show that
often  the  affinity  of  a  protein  for  DNA  is  sharply  reduced  as  the
concentration of NaCl or KCl in the buffer is increased. It might seem
that  the  source  of  such  behavior  would  be  attractive  forces  between
positive charges in the protein and the negatively charged phosphates
of the DNA. The presence of high salt concentrations would then shield
the  attractive  forces  and  weaken  the  binding  by  affecting  both  the
association rate and the dissociation rate. Experimentally, however, the

174  Protein Structure

concentration of salts in the buffer primarily affects only the dissocia-
tion rates!

Consider  the  binding  of  a  protein  to  DNA.  Before  binding  of  the
protein, positively charged ions must reside near the negatively charged
phosphate groups. Some of these will be displaced as the protein binds,
and this displacement, even though it is not the breaking of a covalent
bond, must be considered in the overall binding reaction. Let us con-
sider these to be sodium ions. The reaction can be written 

P  +  nNa+⋅D  →← nNa+  +  P⋅D

Keq  = 

[ P]   ×  [ nNa+⋅D]
[ Na+] n  ×  [ P⋅D]

,

where  P  is  protein  concentration,  D  is  DNA  concentration,  and  an
effective number n of Na+ ions are displaced in the binding reaction.
The  fact  that  n  is  often  greater  than  five  makes  the  binding  affinity
sharply dependent upon salt concentration. The value of n can be easily
extracted from experimental data by plotting the log of Kd against the
log of the salt concentration. Many regulatory proteins appear to dis-
place a net of four to ten ions as they bind.

The physical basis for the ion strength dependence is straightforward.
The  dissociation  of  a  protein  from  DNA  would  require  the  nearly
simultaneous and precise binding of the n sodium ions to their former
positions on the DNA. The higher the concentration of sodium ions in
the solution, the more easily this may be accomplished.

The above explanation can also be couched in thermodynamic terms.
The entropic contribution of the sodium ions to the binding-dissociation
reaction is large. Before the binding of the protein, the ions are localized
near the backbone of the DNA. Upon the binding of the protein, these
ions  are  freed,  with  a  substantial  entropy  increase.  The  greater  the
sodium concentration in the buffer, the smaller the entropy increase
upon  protein  binding  and  therefore  the  weaker  the  protein  binding.
Loosely  bound,  and  therefore  poorly  localized,  ions  do  not  make  a
substantial contribution to the changes in binding as the buffer compo-
sition is changed because their entropies do not change substantially
during the course of the reaction.

Locating Specific Residue-Base Interactions

In Chapter 2 we discussed how a histone bound to DNA can protect the
nucleotides it contacts from DNAse cleavage of phosphodiester bonds.
Biochemical methods similar to those DNAse footprinting experiments
can even identify interactions between specific amino acid residues and
specific bases.  In some cases the biochemical approaches provide  as
much resolution as X-ray crystallography.

First, consider how to test a guess of a specific residue-base interac-
tion. In this approach a correct guess can be confirmed, but a poor guess
yields little information. The idea is that if the amino acid residue in
question is substituted by a smaller residue, say a glycine or alanine,

Figure 6.20  How  replacing  a  DNA  contacting  residue  of  a  protein  with  a
smaller  residue  like  alanine  or  glycine  makes  the  protein  indifferent  to  the
identity of the base that formerly was contacted by the residue.

then the former interaction between the residue and the base will be
eliminated. As a result, the strength of the protein’s binding becomes
independent of the identity of the base formerly contacted, whereas the
wild-type unsubstituted protein would vary in its affinity for the DNA
as the contacted base is varied (Fig. 6.20).

The  work  required  for  this  missing  contact  experiment  is  high.
Genetic engineering techniques must be used to alter the gene encoding
the protein. Similarly, both the wild-type sequence and a sequence for
each base being tested for contacting must also be synthesized. Finally,
the protein must be synthesized in vivo, purified, and its affinity for the
various DNAs tested.

The testing for specific contacts can be streamlined. Instead of having
to guess correctly both the base and the residue, the technique finds
whatever base is contacted by a residue. As before, a variant protein is
made containing a glycine or alanine substitution in the residue sus-
pected of contacting the DNA. The DNA sample is probed biochemically
to find all the residues contacted by the wild-type protein and by the
mutant protein. The difference between the set of bases contacted by
the wild-type protein and the mutant protein is the base or two that are
normally contacted by the altered residue. The procedure for locating
the bases which contact the protein is more fully described in Chapter
10.

to possess, if when it binds to DNA it makes contact in four adjacent

the protein does not reach around the cylinder to make contacts on the
back. Can the protein be spherical or must it be highly elongated?

of 13 amino acids that maximizes the probability the central amino acid
will be found in an alpha helical conformation.

6.18. How do you reconcile the seemingly contradictory conclusions
mentioned  in  the  text  that  amino  acid  changes  in  proteins  generally
produce local structural changes, with our inability to predict secondary
structure with greater than 65% accuracy? The first implies that long-
range interactions are unimportant, and the second that they are highly
important. Hint, see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 439-441 (1993).

Protein Synthesis

7

Having  studied  the  synthesis  of  DNA  and  RNA  and  the  structure  of
proteins,  we  are  now  prepared  to  examine  the  process  of  protein
synthesis. We will first be concerned with the actual steps of protein
synthesis. Then, to develop further our understanding of cellular proc-
esses, we will discuss the rate of peptide elongation, how cells direct
specific proteins to be located in membranes, and how the machinery
that translates messenger RNA into protein in cells is regulated in order
to use most efficiently the limited cellular resources. The major part of
the translation machinery is the ribosomes. A ribosome consists of a
larger and smaller subunit, each containing a major RNA molecule and
more  than  twenty  different  proteins.  The  synthesis  and  structure  of
ribosomes will be considered in a later chapter.

In outline, the process of protein synthesis is as follows. Amino acids
are  activated  for  protein  synthesis  by  amino  acid  synthetases  which
attach the amino acids to their cognate tRNA molecules. The smaller
ribosomal  subunit  and  then  the  larger  ribosomal  subunit  attach  to
messenger RNA at the 5’ end or near the initiating codon. Translation
then  begins  at  an  initiation  codon  with  the  assistance  of  initiation
factors.  During the process  of  protein synthesis, the activated amino
acids to be incorporated into the peptide chain are specified by three-
base codon-anticodon pairings between the messenger and aminoacyl-
tRNA. Elongation of the peptide chain terminates on recognition of one
of the three termination codons, the ribosomes and messenger dissoci-
ate, and the newly synthesized peptide is released. Some proteins appear
to  fold  spontaneously  as  they  are  synthesized,  but  others  appear  to
utilize auxiliary proteins to help in the folding process.

The actual rate of peptide elongation in bacteria is just sufficient to
keep up with transcription; a ribosome can initiate translation immedi-
ately behind an RNA polymerase molecule and keep up with the tran-

scription. In eukaryotic cells, however, the messenger is modified and
transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm before it can be trans-
lated.

Although the cytoplasm in bacteria contains most of the cell’s protein,
the inner membrane, the periplasmic space, and even the outer mem-
brane  contain  appreciable  amounts  of  protein.  Eukaryotic  cells  also
must direct some proteins to organelles and membranes. How do cells
do this? One mechanism is with a signal peptide. These are the N-ter-
minal  20  amino  acids  or  so  of  some  proteins  that  appear  largely
responsible for directing the protein away from the cytoplasm and into
or through the membrane.

Finally,  it  is  necessary  to  discuss  the  regulation  of  the  level  of
ribosomes. Since ribosomes constitute a large fraction of a cell’s total
protein  and  RNA,  only  as  many  ribosomes  as  are  needed  should  be
synthesized.  Consequently,  complicated  mechanisms  have  developed
coupling protein synthesis to ribosome synthesis.

A. Chemical Aspects

Activation of Amino Acids During Protein Synthesis

In Chapter  6 we learned  that proteins possess a definite sequence of
amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds. Aminoacyl-tRNA mole-
cules participate in the formation of these bonds in two ways. First, they
bring activated amino acids to the reaction. They also serve as adapters
between the various three-base codons in the messenger RNA and the
actual  amino  acids  to  be  incorporated  into  the  growing  polypeptide
chain. Because different tRNA molecules must be distinguishable at the

step of attaching amino acids, they differ in structure (Fig. 7.1). On the
other hand, the tRNA molecules must also possess important structural
features in common so that the tRNA molecules may be used in peptide
bond formation at the ribosome. Formation of a peptide bond is ener-
getically unfavorable and is assisted at the step of bond formation by
the  energy  in  the  amino  acid-tRNA  bond.  This  is  an  ester  to  the  3’
hydroxyl  at  the  invariant  -C-C-A  end  of  the  tRNA.  Aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases, one for each amino acid, form these bonds. The formation
of the ester bonds, activation, occurs in two steps. First the enzyme links

the amino acid to AMP, and then transfers it to the 3’ terminal adenosine
of the tRNA (Fig. 7.2).

Some  synthetases  activate  the  2’-hydroxyl  of  the  terminal  base  of
tRNA,  others  activate  the  3’,  and  some  activate  both  the  2’  and  3’
hydroxyls, but the differences probably do not matter because after the
aminoacyl-tRNA is released from the enzyme, the aminoacyl group on
the tRNA migrates back and forth.

Fidelity of Aminoacylation

The aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases are remarkable enzymes since they
recognize amino acids and their cognate tRNA molecules and join them
together.  Inaccuracies  in  either  recognition  process  could  be  highly
deleterious because choosing the wrong amino acid or the wrong tRNA
would ultimately yield a protein with an incorrect sequence. We know,

however, from measurements on peptides highly purified from proteins
of known sequence, that the overall frequency of misincorporation, at
least of charged amino acids, is only about 1/1000.

Let us first consider the process of choosing the correct amino acid.
The greatest difficulty in accurate translation appears to be in discrimi-
nating between two highly similar amino acids. Valine and isoleucine
are an example since replacing a hydrogen on valine with a methyl group
yields isoleucine (Fig. 7.3). The valyl-tRNA synthetase should not have
trouble in discriminating against isoleucine because isoleucine is larger
than valine and probably does not fit into the active site on the enzyme.
The reverse situation is more of a problem. Valine will form all of the
contacts to the enzyme that isoleucine can form except for those to the
missing methyl group. How much specificity could the absence of these
contacts provide? Estimates of the differences in binding energy predict
about a 200-fold discrimination, but since the actual error rate is found
to  be much  lower,  something  in  addition to a simple discrimination
based on one binding reaction must contribute to specificity. An addi-
tional step in the overall reaction in the form of editing by the synthetase
increases the accuracy.

Although isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase can form a valyl adenylate com-
plex, upon the addition of tRNAIle the tRNA is activated and then the

Ile

complex is immediately hydrolyzed. One way to think of this process is
that activation  is a two-step sieving process (Fig.  7.4). It permits  the
correct amino acid and similar but smaller amino acids to be activated.
Then  all  amino  acids  smaller  than  the  correct  amino  acid  have  a
hydrolytic pathway available for removal of the misacylated amino acid.
DNA synthesis and DNA cutting by restriction enzymes also use two-
step  error  checking  to  achieve  high  accuracy.  In  the  case  of  protein
synthesis,  fidelity  is  increased  by  identifying  the  amino  acid  several
times, and for the DNA cutting enzymes, the nucleotide sequence is read
more than once.

double-sieving action of some ami-
noacyl-tRNA synthetases. Only the
correct amino acid is activated and
then avoids the hydrolytic exit. 

How Synthetases Identify the Correct tRNA Molecule

A second problem in specificity of protein synthesis is the selection of
the tRNA molecule by the synthetase. In principle this selection could
be  done  by  reading  the  anticodon  of  the  tRNA.  A  wide  variety  of
experiments have revealed, however, that only for tRNAMet is the anti-
codon the sole determinant of the charging specificity. For about half
of the tRNAs, the anticodon is involved in the recognition process, but
it is not the sole determinant. For the remaining half of the tRNAs, the
anticodon is not involved at all.

Two  extreme  possibilities  exist  for  the  other  charging  specificity
determinants. They  could be the  identity of one or more nucleotides
somewhere in the tRNA. On the  other hand, the  charging  specificity
could be determined by part or all of the overall structure of the tRNA
molecule.  Of  course,  this  structure  is  determined  by  the  nucleotide
sequence, but the structure as dictated by the overall sequence may be
more important than the chemical identity of just a couple of amino or
carboxyl groups. In view of the diversity of nature, it is reasonable to
expect different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases will utilize different struc-
tural details in their identification of their cognate tRNA molecules.

Just  as  in  the  study  of  RNA  splicing,  the  development  of  genetic
engineering  has  greatly  accelerated  the  rate  of  progress  in  under-
standing the specificity determinants on tRNA molecules. This resulted
from facilitating the synthesis in vitro of tRNA molecules of any desired
sequence. Such a synthesis utilizes the phage T7 RNA polymerase to
initiate transcription from a T7 promoter that can be placed near the
end of a DNA molecule (Fig. 7.5). Essentially any DNA sequence down-
stream from the promoter can be used so that any tRNA sequence can
be synthesized. The RNA molecules resulting from such reactions can

be aminoacylated and utilized in translation despite the fact that they
lack  the  specialized  chemical  modifications  that  are  found  on  tRNA
molecules synthesized in vivo. Apparently these modifications are not
essential  to  the  process  of  protein  synthesis  and  they  exist  more  for
fine-tuning.

Genetic engineering also enables us to alter the gene encoding a tRNA
molecule, reinsert the gene in a cell, and examine the in vivo charging
and  translation  properties  of  the  altered  molecule.  The  ability  to  be
charged by alanine synthetase is specified by the identity of just two
nucleotides (Fig. 7.6). This was determined by identifying the smallest
common subset of nucleotide changes that permitted the molecule to
be  charged  with  alanine.  These  proved  to  be  two  nucleotides  in  the
acceptor stem, a G and a U that form a non Watson-Crick base pair.
Providing  these  two  nucleotides  in  any  tRNA  molecule  enables  the
molecule to be charged with alanine. The specificity determinants of
other tRNA molecules have been found to be three or more nucleotides
scattered around the molecule.

The  structure  of  the  crystallized  glutamyl-tRNA  synthetase-tRNA
complex  permitted  direct  examination  of  the  contacts  between  the
enzyme and the tRNA. These showed, as expected, that this enzyme read
the anticodon of the tRNA plus several nucleotides located elsewhere
on the tRNA.

Decoding the Message

What decodes the messages? Clearly, base pairing between a codon of
message and an anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA decodes. This is not
the complete story however. Since the ribosome pays no attention to the

correctness of the tRNA charging, the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are
just  as  important  in  decoding,  for  it  is  also  essential  that  the  tRNA
molecules be charged with the correct amino acid in the first place.

Once the amino acids have been linked to their cognate tRNAs, the
process of protein synthesis shifts to the ribosome. The “code” is the
correspondence  between  the  triplets  of  bases  in  the  codons  and  the
amino acids they specify (Table 7.1). In a few exciting years molecular
biologists  progressed  from  knowing  that  there  must  be  a  code,  to
learning that each amino acid is encoded by three bases on the messen-
ger, to actually determining the code. The history and experiments of
the time are fascinating and can be found in The Eighth Day of Creation
by Horace Freeland Judson.

In the later stages of solving the code it became apparent that the
code  possessed  certain  degeneracies.  Of  the  64  possible  three-base
codons, in most cells, 61 are used to specify the 20 amino acids.  One to
six codons may specify a particular amino acid. As shown in Table 7.1,
synonyms generally differ in the third base of the codons. In the third
position, U is equivalent to C and, except for methionine and trypto-
phan, G is equivalent to A.

Under special circumstances likely to reflect early evolutionary his-
tory, one of the three codons that code for polypeptide  chain termina-
tion also codes for the insertion of selenocysteine. The same codon at
the end of other genes specifies chain termination. Thus, the context
surrounding this codon also determines how it is read. Generally such

context effects change only the rates of insertion of amino acids, but not

With  the  study  of  purified  tRNAs,  several  facts  became  apparent.
First, tRNA contains a number of unusual bases, one of which is inosine,

which  is  occasionally  found  in  the  first  position  of  the  anticodon.
Second, more than one species of tRNA exists for most of the amino
acids.  Remarkably,  however,  the  different  species  of  tRNA  for  any
amino acid all appear to be charged by the same synthetase. Third, strict
Watson-Crick base pairing is not always followed in the third position
of the codon (Table 7.2). Apparently the third base pair of the codon-
anticodon complex permits a variety of base pairings (Fig. 7.7). This
phenomenon  is  called  wobble.  The  G-U  base  pair  of  alanine  tRNA
mentioned above is an example of wobble.

Base Pairing between Ribosomal RNA and Messenger  191

In mitochondria the genetic code might be slightly different from that
described above. There the translation machinery appears capable of
translating all the codons used with only 22 different species of tRNA.
One obstacle to understanding translation in mitochondria is the RNA
editing  that  can  occur  in  these  organelles.  Because  the  sequence  of
mRNA can be changed after its synthesis, we cannot be sure that the
sequence of genes as deduced from the DNA is the sequence that actually
is translated at the ribosome. Hence deductions about the use or lack
of use of particular codons as read from the DNA sequence cannot be
made with reliability.

Base Pairing between Ribosomal RNA and Messenger

Ribosomes must recognize the start codons AUG or GUG on the mes-
senger RNA to initiate protein synthesis. Characterization of the pro-
teins  that  are  synthesized  when  the  lac  operon  or  other  operons are
induced show that normally only one AUG or GUG of a gene is utilized
to initiate protein synthesis. Many of the internal AUG or GUG codons
are not used to initiate protein synthesis. This means that something in
addition to the  initiating codon itself  must signal the  point at which
translation begins.

Studies of bacterial translation show that the first step in initiation
is the binding of messenger to the smaller of the two ribosomal subunits,
the 30S subunit. The absence of a strictly conserved sequence preceding
start codons suggested that whatever first bound the messenger to the
30S  subunit  might  be  an  RNA-RNA  interaction  between  mRNA  and
ribosomal RNA. The originators of this idea, Shine and Dalgarno, were
so confident of their proposal that they proceeded to sequence the 3’ end
of the 16S rRNA which is found in the smaller ribosomal subunit. They
found that the rRNA sequence provided strong support for their idea.
The sequence on mRNA which binds to the 16S ribosomal RNA is called
the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or the ribosome binding site.

Bacterial messengers contain a ribosome-binding sequence slightly
ahead of an initiating AUG. This sequence base pairs well with a region

near the 3’ end of the 16S ribosomal RNA. This upstream region has
been examined in more than hundreds of messenger start sequences.
Typically it is three or four bases and is centered about ten nucleotides
ahead of the start codon. Despite the data to be described below, the
ribosome-binding sequence lying ahead of the AUG initiation codon is

192  Protein Synthesis

not the whole story. Undoubtedly, secondary structure in the mRNA
also can alter translation efficiency. Occasionally, a sequence upstream
or  downstream  from  the  Shine-Dalgarno  sequence  pairs  with  it  and
blocks translation initiation. Examination of the sequence in the vicinity
of the AUG and ribosome-binding sequence has shown the existence of
preferences for some nucleotides. Were no other factors involved, the
identity of all these other nucleotides would be random.

Experimental Support for the Shine-Dalgarno Hypothesis

Since the time of the original proposal by Shine and Dalgarno, four lines
of evidence have provided firm support for the idea that the 3’ end of
the 16S rRNA base pairs with a three- to seven-base stretch of the mRNA
lying ahead of the translation initiation site. The first line of evidence is
inhibition of an in vitro protein synthesis system by an oligonucleotide.
A polynucleotide of sequence very similar to that which is found pre-

Figure 7.9  The base  pairings possible between normal  phage  T7 messenger
and 16S rRNA. Mutation 1 reduces the binding. Mutation 2, a revertant, restores
the ability to base pair with the rRNA, but it pairs in a different position.

ceding the AUG of many messengers inhibits mRNA from binding to
the ribosome. Presumably, this inhibition results from the binding of
the polynucleotides near the end of the 16S rRNA, thereby blocking the
ability of the ribosomes to bind properly to messenger.

The second line of evidence for the Shine-Dalgarno proposal is direct
physical evidence for base pairing between the messenger and the 3’ end
of 16S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 7.8). This experiment used a bacteriocidal
agent called colicin E3 which is released from some strains of bacteria.
E3 kills by inactivating the ribosomes in sensitive cells by cleaving their
16S rRNA molecules 40 bases from the 3’ end. To test the ribosome-
binding site idea Jakes and Steitz first bound a fragment of phage R17
messenger in vitro to ribosomes in an initiation complex and then cut
the ribosomal RNA by the addition of colicin E3. They demonstrated
the presence of base pairing between the messenger and the 3’-terminal
40 bases of ribosomal RNA by co-electrophoresis of the fragment of R17
RNA  with  the  fragment  of  16S  rRNA.  Repeating  the  experiment  but
preventing formation of the mRNA-ribosome initiation complex pre-
vented formation of the hybrid between the two RNAs.

Genetics provides two additional arguments for the utilization of the
ribosome-binding  site.  A  base  change  in  phage  T7  messenger  in  the
ribosome-binding site reduced the translation efficiency of the messen-
ger. The proof came with the isolation of a revertant that restored the
high translation efficiency. The revertant did not recreate the original
sequence; it created another ribosome-binding sequence in the mRNA,
two nucleotides further upstream (Fig. 7.9). 

An  elegant  demonstration  of  pairing  between  mRNA  and  rRNA
became  possible  with  genetic  engineering.  One  gene  in  E.  coli  was

194  Protein Synthesis

altered  to  possess  a  totally  different  ribosome-binding  site.  An  addi-
tional gene coding for the ribosomal 16S RNA was added to the same
cells.  Its  recognition  region  near  the  3’-OH  end  was  changed  to  be
complementary to the altered ribosome-binding site on the one gene.
Only when both the altered gene and altered rRNA gene were present
in cells was the protein from the altered gene synthesized. This proved
beyond  any  doubt  that  the  ribosome-binding  sequence  actually  does
base pair with a portion of the 16S rRNA. 

Eukaryotic Translation and the First AUG

The sequences preceding the initiation codons in eukaryotic messengers
do not contain  significant regions of complementarity to the 18S RNA
from  the  smaller  ribosomal  subunit.  Additionally,  translation  almost
always  begins  on  these  RNAs  at  the  first  AUG  codon.  In  bacteria,  a
number of AUG triplets can precede the actual initiation codon. Trans-
lation  of  most  eukaryotic  messengers  begins  with  the  binding  of  a
cap-recognizing  protein  to  the  5’  end  of  the  mRNA.  The  translation
efficiency of most, but not all, messengers in eukaryotic systems is much
higher  when  the  messenger  contains  the  cap  structure  discussed  in
Chapter  5.  Additional  proteins  bind  followed  by  the  40S  ribosomal
subunit. With the consumption of ATP, the complex moves down the
RNA  to  the  first  AUG,  at  which  point  another  protein  binds  to  the
complex and finally the 60S ribosomal subunit binds (Fig. 7.10). Trans-
lation begins from this point. The preinitiation complex can open and
slide  right  through  moderately  stable  regions  of  base  paired  RNA  to
reach  the  first  AUG  of  the messenger.  This  is  unlike the  prokaryotic
translation machinery, which has difficulty reaching an initiation codon
that is buried in extraneous secondary structure of the mRNA.

In  special  situations  when  only  a  low  level  of  protein  is  required,
translation begins not at the first AUG, but at a later one. Similarly, an

AUG  codon  immediately  followed  by  a  termination  signal  and  then
another AUG codon, also produces a low translation efficiency.

The need for a mechanism that can deposit the translation machinery
at the initiation codon despite the existence of secondary structure in
the mRNA arises from the eukaryotic translation pathway. In eukary-
otes, the RNA is synthesized, spliced, transported to the cytoplasm and
then translated. Undoubtedly, regions of secondary structure obscuring
a potential ribosome-binding site would exist on many species of mes-
sengers. To circumvent this problem, the translation apparatus recog-
nizes the capped 5’ end, which cannot be involved in base pairing. After
binding, the apparatus slides down the mRNA until it reaches a starting
AUG. In contrast, prokaryotes lack a need for binding and sliding since
ribosomes attach to a ribosome recognition sequence on mRNA as soon
as it protrudes from the RNA polymerase. Thus, prokaryotic mRNA has
little opportunity to fold and hide the start region of a protein.

Tricking the Translation Machinery into Initiating

Once messenger has bound to the smaller ribosomal subunit and then
a larger subunit has been added, translation can begin. Escherichia coli
proteins initiate primarily at AUG codons with a peptide chain analog
in which part of the initiating amino acid looks like a peptide bond (Fig.
7.11). This permits the system to form the first real peptide bond with
essentially the same machinery as it uses to form subsequent peptide
bonds.

The initiation analog is N-formyl methionine. Rather than utilize an
entirely separate charging pathway with a separate tRNA synthetase,
the cells formylate a methionine after it has been put on a tRNAMet. This

is,  however,  a  special  tRNA  called  tRNAf
initiation. Methionine bound to the second type of tRNAMet cannot be
formylated, and this is used only for elongation at internal AUG codons.
This scheme prevents the difficulties that would arise from attempting
to initiate a protein with an unformylated methionine or attempting to
put a formylated methionine on the interior of a protein. A new question

is raised by the two tRNAs. How are the two methionine tRNAs distin-
guished during translation? AUG codons occur both at the beginning of
protein coding sequences and within coding sequences.

The two Met-tRNAs are distinguished by a set of proteins used in the
initiation and elongation processes. These proteins carry the charged
tRNA molecules into the ribosome (Fig. 7.12). Interactions between the
proteins and the ribosome-messenger complex help hold the tRNA-pro-
tein complex in the ribosome. The most important of these interactions
is that between the three-base anticodon of the tRNA and the three-base
codon in the messenger. It is these codon-anticodon interactions that
specify the f-Met initiating amino acid and successive amino acids along
the polypeptide chain. The protein IF2, initiation factor 2, carries the
f−met−tRNAf
Met into the site normally occupied by the growing peptide
chain, the P site, whereas all other charged tRNAs, including met-tRNA,
are carried into the other site, the acceptor, A, site, by the elongation
factors.  Thus  N-formyl  methionine  can  be  incorporated  only  at  the
beginning of a polypeptide.

In addition to the initiation factor IF2, two other proteins, IF1 and
IF3, are also used during the initiation steps. Factor IF1 accelerates the
initiation steps but is not absolutely required, and it can be assayed in
vitro by its acceleration of  3H-Met-tRNAMet binding to ribosomes. IF3
binds to the 30S subunit to assist the initiation process.

The initiation of translation in eukaryotes shows some similarity to
the process used in bacteria. Two methionine tRNAs are used, one for
initiation and one for elongation, but the methionine on the initiating
tRNA  is  not  formylated.  Methionine  on  this  tRNA,  however,  can  be
formylated  by  the  bacterial  formylating  enzyme.  It  appears  as  if  the
eukaryotic initiation system has evolved from the bacterial system to

Protein Elongation  197

synthesis,  but  the  tRNAf

Met.

Protein Elongation

Although it would appear that the charged tRNAs could diffuse into the
ribosome and bind to the codons of mRNA, they are in fact carried into
the  binding  sites  on  a  protein.  The  protein  that  serves  this  function
during elongation was originally called Tu (unstable) but is now some-
times called EF1 (elongation factor 1). A rather complex cycle is used
for carrying the charged tRNAs to the ribosome A site (Fig. 7.13). First,
GTP  binds to EF1, then an  aminoacyl tRNA binds, and this complex
enters the ribosome A site containing a complementary codon. There
GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and EF1-GDP is ejected from the ribosome.
The completion of the cycle takes place in solution. GDP is displaced
from EF1-GDP by EF2, which in turn is displaced by GTP. The binding
of GDP to EF1 is tight; Kd equals approximately 3 × 10-9 M. This plus the
fact that EF1 binds to filters permits a simple filter-binding assay to be
used to quantitate the protein. Originally the very tight binding for GDP
generated confusion because the commercial preparation of GTP con-
tained minor amounts of contaminating GDP.

Both  the  initiation  factor  IF2  and  the  elongation  factor  EF1  carry
charged  tRNA  molecules  into  the  ribosome.  Not  surprisingly,  they
possess considerable amino acid sequence homology. Additionally, cells
which incorporate selenocysteine into the one or two proteins contain-
ing this amino acid use yet a third factor. This carries the charged tRNA
into the ribosome, and, as expected, also possesses significant homology
with the other two factors. All three of the proteins are members of the
broad and important class of proteins known as G proteins as they bind
GTP. In eukaryotic cells the G proteins most often are part of signal
transduction pathways from receptor proteins bound in the membrane
to gene regulation or other intracellular points of regulation.

polypeptide now occupies the P site, the A site is empty, awaiting arrival of EF1
with another aa-tRNA, and the discharged tRNA occupies the E site.

Peptide Bond Formation

Elongation  of  the  polypeptide  chain  occurs  on  the  ribosome.  The
growing chain attached to a tRNA occupies the peptidyl, P, site of the
ribosome (Fig. 7.14). Alongside is another charged tRNA, also with its
anticodon  base  paired  to  a  codon  on  the  mRNA.  This  second  site  is
termed the acceptor, or A site since the amino acid here will act as an
acceptor  as  the  peptide  chain  is  transferred  to  it.  This  transfer  is
catalyzed  by  the  peptidyl  transferase  activity  of  the  large  subunit.
Although this activity is stimulated by ribosomal proteins, in vitro it can
be catalyzed by the ribosomal RNA itself. This step does not require an
external source of energy like GTP.

Translocation

Following  formation  of  a  peptide  bond,  the  P  site  of  the  ribosome
contains an uncharged tRNA, and the A site contains a tRNA linked to
the growing peptide chain. Translocation is the process of recocking the
elongation mechanism. The uncharged tRNA in the P site is moved to
the exit, or E site, messenger translocates three bases toward the P site,

Termination, Nonsense, and Suppression  199

thereby moving the tRNA with the peptide chain into the P site. The
translocation process itself requires hydrolysis of a GTP molecule that
has been carried to the ribosome by the EF-G or G factor. Since the
elongation  factors are  used once for  each amino  acid  added, a  large
number  of  molecules  of  each  must  be  present  in  the  cell  to  support
protein synthesis. It is also logical that their level should parallel the
level of ribosomes, and, indeed, as growth rate varies, their levels do
keep pace with the levels of ribosomes. With the entry of a charged tRNA
into the  A  site of the ribosome,  the  uncharged tRNA  in the E  site  is
released.

At some time during the growth of the peptide chains, the N-terminal
amino  acid  is  modified.  Approximately  40%  of  the  proteins  isolated
from E. coli are found to begin with methionine, but since all initiate
with N-formyl methionine, the remaining 60% must lose at least the
N-terminal methionine. Similarly, the 40% of the proteins that do begin
with methionine all lack the formyl group. Thus the formyl group must
be removed after protein synthesis has initiated. Examination of nas-
cent polypeptide chains on ribosomes shows that the formyl group is
missing if they are larger than about 30 amino acids, and therefore the

Deformylase

deformylase could well be a part of the ribosome. It could act when the
growing peptide chain is long enough to reach the enzyme.

The deformylase is a very labile enzyme that is exceedingly sensitive
to  sulfhydryl  reagents.  Since  many  other  enzymes  isolated  from  the
same cells require the same sulfhydryl reagents for stability, it may be
that the deformylase is normally bound to some structure that contrib-
utes to its stability, and when it is isolated from extracts and partially
purified, it is particularly labile in its unnatural environment.

Termination, Nonsense, and Suppression

How  is  the  elongation process  ended  and the completed  polypeptide
released  from the final tRNA and from the ribosome? The signal for
ending the elongation process is any one of the three codons UGA, UAA,
and UAG. Of the 64 possible three-base codons, 61 code for amino acids,
and  are  “sense,”  and  3  code  for  termination,  and  are  “nonsense.”  In
termination,  as  in  the  other  steps  of  protein  synthesis,  specialized
proteins come to the ribosome to assist the process. Apparently upon
chain termination, the ribosome is unlocked but not immediately re-
leased from the messenger. For a short while before it can fully disso-
ciate from messenger, it can drift phaselessly forward and backward

Three proteins are involved in termination: a protein factor R1, which
is necessary for termination at UAA and UAG codons; a protein factor
R2, which is necessary for termination at UAA and UGA codons; and a

protein  R3,  which  accelerates  the  termination  process.  Cells  contain
approximately one molecule of R per five ribosomes, a number consis-
tent with the usage of these molecules.

The  existence  of  chain  termination  codons  is  responsible  for  an
interesting phase in the growth of molecular biology. A mutation within
a gene can change one of the 61 sense codons into one of the polypeptide
chain terminating, or nonsense codons. This result shows that only the
three bases are necessary to code for chain termination, no others are
required, and no special secondary structure of the mRNA is required.
As a result of a nonsense codon within a gene, the protein encoded by
the mutated gene  will be prematurely terminated during translation.
Usually the shortened polypeptide possesses no enzymatic activity, and
it  is  frequently  degraded  by  proteases  within  the  cell.  An  additional
effect of a nonsense mutation is depressed translation of a following
gene in an operon. This polar effect results from termination of tran-
scription due to the sizeable portion of the barren mRNA following the
nonsense codon and preceding the next ribosome initiation site. Quite
surprisingly, some bacterial strains were found that could suppress the
effects of a nonsense mutation. Although the suppressors rarely restored
the  levels  of  the  “suppressed”  protein  to  prior  levels,  the  cell  often

Termination, Nonsense, and Suppression  201

possessed sufficient amounts of the protein to survive. In the case of a
nonsense mutation in a phage gene, the suppressor strains permitted
the phage to grow and form plaques.

Capecchi  and  Gussin  showed  that  a  suppressing  strain  inserted  a
particular amino acid at the site of the nonsense mutation. It did so by
“mistranslating” the nonsense codon as a codon for an amino acid. They
also showed that the mistranslation resulted from a change in one of
the  tRNAs  for  the  inserted  amino  acid.  Subsequently,  sequencing  of
suppressor tRNAs has shown that, except in a special case, their antico-
dons have been altered so as to become complementary to one of the
termination codons. Apparently one of two different events can then
occur  when  a  ribosome  reaches  a  nonsense  codon  in  a  suppressing
strain. Termination can occur via the normal mechanism, or an amino
acid can be inserted into the growing polypeptide chain and translation
can proceed.

Using  genetic  selections,  suppressors  have  been  found  that  insert
tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, glutamine, and serine. Except in unusual
cases, such suppressors must be  derived from the original  tRNAs by
single  nucleotide  changes.  By  chemical  means  and  the  utilization  of
genetic  engineering, an additional half dozen or so suppressors have
been synthesized.

The termination codon UAG has come to be called amber and UAA
called  ochre.  No  generally  used  name  for  the  UGA  codon  exists,  al-
though it is sometimes called opal. Amber-suppressing tRNAs read only
the UAG codon, and ochre-suppressing tRNAs read both UAA and UAG
codons as a result of the “wobble” in translation. Since the R factors are
protein and cannot be constructed like tRNA, it is no surprise that R2
does not “wobble” and does not recognize the UGG (trp) codon.

How do normal proteins terminate in suppressing cells? If a suppres-
sor were always to insert an amino acid in response to a termination
codon  instead  of  terminating,  then  many  of  the  cellular  proteins  in
suppressor-containing cells would be fused to other proteins or at least
be appreciably longer than usual. The problem of terminating normal
proteins  could  be  solved  in  part  by  the  presence  of  several  different
termination signals at the end of every gene. Then only the introduction
of  several  different  suppressors  to a cell  could  create  problems. Few
genes,  however,  have been  found  to be ended by  tandem translation
terminators.

The more likely explanation for the viability of nonsense-suppressing
strains  is  that  the  efficiency  of  suppression  never  approaches  100%.
Typically it is 10% to 40%.  Hence suppression  of normal translation
termination codons can fuse or lengthen some proteins in a cell, but
most terminate as usual. On the other hand, the gene possessing the
nonsense  mutation  would  occasionally  yield  a  suppressed  instead  of
terminated protein. A suppression efficiency of 20% could reduce the
amount of some cellular proteins from 100% to 80%, relatively speaking,
not a substantial reduction.  On the  other hand,  the  existence of this
suppressor would raise the amount of the suppressed protein from 0%

202  Protein Synthesis

to  20%  of  normal.  Relative  to  the  nonsuppressed  level,  this  is  an
enormous increase.

Chaperones and Catalyzed Protein Folding

In the  1960s Anfinson showed that pancreatic ribonuclease could be
denatured  and,  when  placed  in  buffers  that  resemble  intracellular
solvent conditions, would renature. This finding led to the belief that all
proteins fold in vivo without the assistance of other proteins. Conse-
quently it has come as a second surprise to find that virtually all types
of cells, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, possess proteins that appear
to assist the folding of nascent proteins. Although the majority of the
cell’s  proteins  do  fold  on  their  own,  an  important  number  utilize
auxiliary folding proteins.

In  the  E.  coli  cytoplasm,  some  newly  synthesized  and  therefore
unfolded proteins first interact with DnaK and then DnaJ. Binding to
these two proteins prevents premature misfolding or aggregation. Then,
with the assistance of GrpE, and the hydrolysis of ATP, the oligomeric
protein GroEL/ES binds. This complex recognizes secondary structure
of polypeptides and appears to stabilize conformational intermediates
as the newly synthesized proteins settle from what is called the molten
globule state into their final compact folded state.

Eukaryotic  cells  possess  analogs  of  DnaK  and  GroEL.  These  are
known as the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp60. The synthesis of
these 70,000 and 60,000 dalton proteins is dramatically increased by
exposure  of  the  cells  to  heat  or  other  agents  that  denature  proteins.
Members of these families help maintain polypeptides in the extended
state  for  import  into  mitochondria  and  then  help  fold  the  imported
polypeptide. The proteins are called chaperones for their roles in assist-
ing the transport process.

Resolution of a Paradox

Hybridization  is  possible  between  nucleic  acids  of  complementary
sequence. Of course, there is a lower limit to the length of the partici -
pating polymers. A single adenine in solution is not normally seen to
base  pair  with  a  single  thymine.  The  lower  length  limit  for  specific
hybridization  between  two  nucleic  acid  molecules  in  typical  buffers
containing 0.001 M to 0.5 M salt at temperatures between 10° C and
70°C is about ten bases. How then can protein synthesis have any degree
of accuracy since only three base pairs form between the codon and
anticodon?

One  part  of  the  answer  to  how  triplet  base  pairing  can  provide
accuracy in protein synthesis is simply that additional binding energy
is provided by contacts other than base pairing. A second part of the
answer is that by holding the codon and anticodon rigid and in comple-
mentary shapes, binding energy is not consumed in bringing all three
bases of the codon and anticodon into correct positions (Fig. 7.16). Once
pairing occurs at the first base, the second and third bases are already

in  position  to  pair.  When  two  complementary  trinucleotides  bind  to
each other, this is not the case. Even after one base pair has formed, the
second and third bases of each polymer must be brought into the correct
positions before they can base pair. Additional binding energy is con-
sumed  in  properly  orienting  them.  This  is  another  example  of  the
chelate effect.

A  simple  hybridization  experiment  with  tRNA  provides  a  direct
demonstration of the consequences of correctly positioning and orient-
ing bases. Two tRNA  molecules  with  self-complementary  anticodons
will hybridize! Since the structure of the entire tRNA molecule serves
to hold the anticodon rigid, the binding energy derived from forming
the second and third base pairs need not go into holding these in the
proper position. They already are in the correct position. As a result, the
two tRNA molecules will hybridize via their anticodons whereas self-
complementary trinucleotides will not hybridize.

B. Physiological Aspects

Messenger Instability

The information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein is carried
from the DNA to ribosomes in the messenger RNA. Once the necessary
proteins have been synthesized from a messenger, it is necessary that
the  translation  of  the  messenger  cease.  In  principle,  exponentially
growing bacterial cells can eliminate unneeded mRNA merely by dilu-
tion due to growth of the cells. Cells that have ceased overall growth,
such  as  eukaryotic  cells  in  a  fully  grown  organism,  cannot  use  this
approach.

rectilinear coordinates. Right: Kinetics if plotted on semilogarithmic coordi-
nates.

Complicated mechanisms can be imagined for destruction of mes-
senger once it has been used a fixed number of times. Cells appear not
to use strict bookkeeping on translation, however. Once a messenger
RNA has been synthesized, it has a fixed probability per unit time of
being degraded by nucleases (Fig. 7.17). This is a random decay process.
The population of such molecules then can be characterized as having
a half-life and will show an exponential decay in levels if synthesis stops.
Some  molecules  in  the  population  will  survive  for  long  times  while
others will be degraded soon after their synthesis.

Cells  that  must  adapt  to  a  changing  environment  must  vary  their
enzyme  synthesis  and  consequently  possess  many  messengers  with
relatively short lifetimes. Most bacterial messengers have half-lives of
about two minutes, although some messengers have half-lives of over
ten  minutes.  Some  messengers  in  eukaryotic  cells  have  half-lives  of
several hours and other eukaryotic messengers have half-lives of several
weeks or even longer in stored forms.

Protein Elongation Rates

In  bacteria,  the  protein  elongation  rate  is  about  16  amino  acids  per
second. This means the ribosomes are moving about 48 nucleotides per
second  along  the  messenger  RNA.  This  value  is  very  close  to  the
corresponding transcription rate of 50 to 60 bases per second. Therefore
once a ribosome begins translation it can keep up with the transcribing
RNA polymerase. In several of the better-studied operons, the rate of
ribosome attachment is sufficiently fast that the ribosomes are rather

closely spaced on the messenger, with about 100 Å of free space between
ribosomes. In other operons, however, the spacing is greater.

How  can the in vivo rate of protein elongation be measured? One
approach would be to use methods analogous to those used to measure
RNA  elongation  rates  as  described  in  Chapter  4.  Unfortunately,  no
adequate  inhibitors  of  protein  initiation  analogous  to  rifamycin  are
known, and slightly more complicated experiments must be done. The
most  general  method  for  rate  measurement  uses  an  idea  originally
developed for measurement of RNA elongation rates before rifamycin
was available.

Consider an experiment in which a radioactive amino acid is added
to a culture of growing cells (Fig. 7.18). Let us focus our attention on a
class of protein of one particular size and consider intervals that are
short compared with the cell doubling time. The number of polypeptide
chains in the size class completed after the addition of radioactive label
is proportional to the time of labeling, n α t.

Also, for labeling intervals shorter than the time required to synthe-
size this size of polypeptide chain from one end to the other, the average
amount of label incorporated into each chain is proportional to the time
that label has been present. Hence during this early period, the total
amount of radioactivity in the particular size class increases in propor-
tion  to  the  number  of  chains  released  multiplied  by  their  average
radioactivity. Both of these are proportional to the time of labeling, t.

Time t

Thus the radioactivity in the particular size class of protein increases in
proportion to t2.

After label has been present for the length of time, T, necessary to
synthesize completely the polypeptide, the radioactivity per completed
peptide chain can no longer increase. After this time, the radioactivity
in the particular polypeptide size class can only increase in proportion
to  the  number  of  chains  completed.  That  is,  the  radioactivity  now
increases in proportion to t.

For experimental quantitation, it is convenient to compare the radio-
activity in a particular size class of polypeptide to the total radioactivity
in all sizes of polypeptide. The total amount of radioactivity in all size
classes  of  polypeptide  must  increase  in  proportion  to  the  time  of
labeling, t. Therefore the fraction of radioactivity in a particular size
class of protein increases in proportion to t until the radioactive label
has  been  present  long enough  for the  entire length of the  protein  to
become radioactively labeled. Thereafter, the fraction of label in the size
class remains constant (Fig. 7.19). Hence, determining the transition
time from linear increase to being constant provides the synthesis time
for the particular size class of polypeptide.

The experimental protocol for performing the elongation rate meas-
urement is simply to add a radioactive amino acid to a growing culture
of cells. At intervals thereafter, samples are withdrawn and the protein

electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel. This provides the requisite size
separation of the polypeptides as described in Chapter 4. The results

Directing Proteins to Specific Cellular Sites  207

found in E. coli and other bacteria are that the protein elongation rate
is about 16 amino acids per second when cells are growing at 37°. This
value is independent of the length of the polypeptide chain. A similar
value is found by measuring the time until the appearance of N-terminal
label in free completed β-galactosidase or by measuring the induction
kinetics of enzymatically active β-galactosidase.

Directing Proteins to Specific Cellular Sites

Cells must direct proteins to several different locations. In addition to
the cytoplasm in which most proteins in bacteria are found, proteins
are also found in membranes, the cell wall, in the periplasmic space,
and secreted altogether. Proteins in eukaryotic cells are found in the
cytoplasm  and  in  various  cell  organelles  such  as  the  mitochondria,
chloroplasts, lysosomes. Proteins may be excreted as well. Proteins are
synthesized in the cytoplasm, but directing them to enter or cross the
cell membranes occurs during or shortly after synthesis of the protein.
How is this done?

Crucial  first  observations  on  protein  localization  were  made  on
immunoglobulin secretion. There it was observed that ribosomes syn-
thesizing immunoglobulin were bound to the endoplasmic reticulum.
Furthermore, when messenger from the membrane-bound ribosomes
was extracted and translated in vitro, immunoglobulin was synthesized;
however, it was slightly larger  than the normal protein. This  protein
possessed about 20 extra amino acids at its N-terminus. Finally, when
translation that had initiated in vivo was completed in vitro, immuno-
globulin of the normal length was synthesized. These observations led
Blobel to propose the signal peptide model for excretion of proteins.

The signal peptide model utilizes observations on immunoglobulin
excretion and has the following parts (Fig. 7.20): first, the N-terminal

208  Protein Synthesis

sequence of a protein to be excreted contains a signal that specifies its
transport;  second, during  translation  of  messenger  coding  for an ex-
creted protein, the N-terminal amino acids are required for binding the
ribosomes to the membrane; third, during the synthesis of the remain-
der of the protein, the growing polypeptide chain is directly excreted
through the membrane; fourth, often during synthesis the signal peptide
is  cleaved  from  the  remainder  of  the  protein.  This  leads  to  the  fifth
element  of  the  model:  there  should  exist  in  or  on  the  membrane  a
protease to cleave the signal peptide from excreted proteins.

Verifying the Signal Peptide Model

Often it is easier to make observations on eukaryotic cells and then to
prove the resulting ideas with experiments done on bacteria. One direct
demonstration  of  concomitant  translation  and  excretion  through  a
membrane was made in bacteria. Chains of a periplasmic protein in the
process  of  being  synthesized  were  labeled  by  a  chemical  that  was
excluded from the cytoplasm by the inner membrane. The experiment
was done by adding the labeling chemical to spheroplasts. These are
cells lacking their outer membrane and peptidyl-glycan layer. Shortly
after adding the reactive labeling compound, membrane-bound ribo-
somes were isolated and their nascent polypeptide chains were exam-
ined and were found to be labeled. Proteins that are normally found in
the cytoplasm were not similarly labeled.

Does the N-terminal sequence on a protein signal that the remainder
of  the  protein  is  to  be  transported  into  or  through  a  membrane?  In
principle, this could be tested by tricking a cell into synthesizing a new
protein in which the N-terminal sequence from an excreted protein has
been fused to a protein normally found in the cytoplasm. If the hybrid
protein is excreted, then the new N-terminal sequence must be signaling
export.

Fortunately, E. coli has been sufficiently well studied that a number
of candidates exist whose N-terminal sequences might be used in such
a project. The malF gene product is a protein involved in the uptake of
maltose into cells. It is located in the periplasmic space. This should be
an excellent source of an “excretion-coding” N-terminal sequence. The
ideal  situation  to  test  the  excretion  hypothesis  would  be  to  fuse  the
N-terminal sequence of malF to an easily assayed cytoplasmic protein.
One very good candidate for this fusion is β-galactosidase, a protein for
which the genetics have also been fully developed.

Remarkably, the fusion of the N-terminal portion of the malF gene
to β-galactosidase was performed in vivo without using recombinant
DNA  techniques  (Fig.  7.21).  Through  clever  genetic  manipulations,
Silhavy and Beckwith moved the β-galactosidase gene, lacZ, near malF
and then generated a deletion that fused the N-terminal portion of the
malF gene to β-galactosidase. A postulate of the signal peptide model
could therefore be tested. Indeed, a sizable fraction of the β-galactosi-
dase from some of the fusion strains was not located in the cytoplasm

but instead was bound to or located within the inner membranes of the
cells.

How do you show that a protein is located in the inner membrane of
a cell? One method is to disrupt cells, to collect membrane fragments,
and then to separate the inner and outer membrane fragments and assay
each for the protein. Inner membrane is less dense than outer mem-
brane, and therefore the two can be separated according to density by
isopycnic  centrifugation  in  a  tube  containing  a  gradient  of  sucrose
concentration (Fig. 7.22). The two membrane fractions sediment down
the tube into higher and higher sucrose concentrations until they reach
positions where their densities equal the density of the sucrose. There
they come to rest. By assay of the fractions collected from such a sucrose
gradient, the β-galactosidase from a malF-lacZ fusion could be demon-

strated to be located largely in the inner membrane of the cells (Fig.
7.23).

Is the N-terminal sequence from malF actually necessary for export
of  the  β-galactosidase  into  or  through  the  membrane?  Some  of  the
fusions of malF to lacZ that were generated in the study yielded proteins
that remained in the cytoplasm. Genetic studies showed that the process
of producing the fusions in these strains had removed most of the signal
peptide  of  the  malF  gene.  Other  studies  have  shown  that  mutations
which abolish export of fusion proteins alter the signal peptide. These
experiments  show  that  the  signal  peptide  plays  an  important  role  in
export. It is clear, however, that the signal peptide is not the whole story.
The malF-lacZ fusion protein was stuck to the inner membrane. It was
not located in the periplasmic space, the final destination of the native
malF protein. Therefore something in the structure of the β-galactosi-
dase protein prevents the hybrid from reaching the periplasmic space.
Hence, reaching the periplasmic space requires the leader sequence as
well as a compatible structure in the remainder of the protein.

The Signal Recognition Particle and Translocation

In some types of eukaryotic cells, most of the proteins translocated into
or across membranes utilize the signal recognition particles. These are
small  ribonucleoprotein  particles  containing  a  300  nucleotide  RNA
molecule and five proteins, ranging in size from 14 KDa to 72 KDa. As
the elongating signal peptide protrudes from the ribosome, the signal
recognition particles bind and arrest translation. After binding of the
signal  recognition  particle  to  the  endoplasmic  reticulum,  translation
resumes and the protein is translocated across the membrane during its
synthesis. The generality of this process is not  known,  and some eu-

Expectations for Ribosome Regulation  211

karyotic cells seem not to arrest translation. Controversy has waxed hot
on the matter of whether bacteria also utilize the same sort of pathway.
They contain a small ribonucleoprotein particle containing an RNA that
sediments at 4.5S. This possesses significant homology to the eukaryotic
signal recognition particle, but its role in protein secretion is not yet
clear. 

Can the roles of the signal recognition particle components be iden-
tified?  Genetics  frequently  can  be  utilized  in  simpler  organisms  to
obtain mutants unable to perform certain reactions. The complexity of
eukaryotic systems blocks the use of mutants for functional dissection
of the signal recognition particle. Instead, a biochemical approach had
to be used.

There  are  two  requirements  for  a  biochemical  dissection.  First,  it
must be possible to assay for each of the steps in the process. This is
possible. Binding of signal recognition particles can easily be measured
because after binding they cosediment with the translating ribosomes.
By using homogenous messenger, translation arrest can be seen by the
failure of the proteins to be completed and by the accumulation of short
incomplete proteins. Translocation into membranes can be quantitated
by adding membrane vesicles to a translation mixture. Translocation of
the protein into the vesicles leaves them resistant to protease digestion.
The second requirement is the ability to take the signal recognition
particle apart and then to reassemble it. When the particle had been
dissociated and the various protein components were separated, they
were individually inactivated by reaction with N-ethylmaleimide. Par-
ticles  were  reassembled  containing  one  reacted  component  and  the
remainder unreacted. By this means, the proteins responsible for signal
recognition,  translation  arrest,  and  translocation  were  identified.  In

contrast to many systems, each of these functions was determined by a
separate component of the particle. Many times, functions are shared.

Expectations for Ribosome Regulation

The final topic we consider in this chapter is the regulation of the level
of the protein synthesis machinery itself. Not surprisingly, we will find
that the synthesis of this machinery is regulated by the intensity of its
use.

A ribosome is a large piece of cellular machinery. It consists of about
55 proteins, two large pieces of RNA, and one or two smaller RNAs.

212  Protein Synthesis

Hence it is natural to expect a cell to regulate levels of ribosomes so that
they are always used at the highest possible efficiency. Since bacterial
cells and some eukaryotic cells may grow with a wide variety of rates,
a sophisticated regulation mechanism is necessary to ensure that ribo-
somes are fully utilized and synthesizing polypeptides at their maximal
rate under most growth conditions.

In an earlier section we discussed the finding that proteins in bacteria
are elongated at about 16 amino acids per second. In the next sections
we will find that the rate of cellular protein synthesis averaged over all
the ribosomes is also about 16 amino acids per second. This means that
virtually no ribosomes sit idle. All are engaged in protein synthesis.

Proportionality of Ribosome Levels and Growth Rates

The dramatic ability of  bacteria  to grow with a wide variety of rates
prompts the question of how they manage to maintain balanced synthe-
sis of their macromolecules.  In a study  of this  question, Schaechter,
Maaløe, and Kjeldgaard made the discovery that ribosomes are used at
constant efficiency, independent of the cell growth rate. To appreciate
their  contribution  fully,  it  will  be  helpful  first  to  examine  a  related
question: what is the average rate of protein synthesis per ribosome? As
a first step we will estimate this value using typical cellular parameters,
then we will calculate this value more carefully and include the effects
of increase in the number of ribosomes during a cell doubling time.

An average bacterial cell with a doubling time of 50 minutes contains
about 1 × 10-13 g protein and about 10,000 ribosomes. Approximating
the molecular weight of amino acids to be 100,

 1 × 10-13 g protein is 1 × 10-13/102 = 10-15 moles amino acid;
10-15 moles amino acid is 6 × 1023 × 10-15 = 6 × 108 molecules;
104 ribosomes polymerize these 6 × 108 amino acids in 50 min or 3 ×

103 sec.

 Thus the average rate of protein synthesis per ribosome is 6 × 108/3
× 103 = 20 amino acids per second per ribosome. Compared to the typical
turnover number of enzymes, greater than 1,000 per second, this is a
low number. We have seen already, however, the process of addition of
a single amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain is complex and
involves many steps.

To calculate  accurately  the  rate  of  protein  synthesis per  ribosome
during steady-state growth, we must include the growth of the cells in
the calculation. This can be done in the following way. Define αr as the
relative rate of synthesis of ribosomal protein, that is,

αr = 

dPr
dt
dPt
dt

where Pr, is ribosomal protein and Pt is total protein. Let R(t) be the
number of ribosomes in a culture at time t. Since ribosome number will

increase like cell number, R(t) = R(0) eµt, and hence, 
the  rate  of  ribosome  synthesis,  dR/dt,  equals  the  rate  of  ribosomal
protein synthesis in amino acids per unit time divided by the number
of amino acids in the protein of one ribosome, C:

dR

Then dPt/dt equals the number of ribosomes times the average elonga-

which yields K = µC/αr, our desired relation. Note that if αr is roughly
proportional to the growth rate, as has been found for bacteria except
at the slowest growth rates (Fig. 7.24), then the term µ/αr is a constant
and  hence  K,  average  activity  of  a  ribosome,  is  independent  of  the
growth rate.

This value is close to the elongation rate of polypeptides, showing that
most ribosomes in the bacterial cell are engaged in protein synthesis
and are not sitting idle.

A measurement of αr at any time during cell growth can be accom-
plished by adding a radioactive amino acid to growing cells for a short
interval (Fig. 7.25). Then an excess of the nonradioactive form of the
amino acid is added and cells are allowed to grow until all the radioac-
tive ribosomal proteins have been incorporated into mature ribosomes.
The  value  of  αr,  is  the  fraction  of  radioactivity  in  ribosomal  protein
compared to total radioactivity in all the cellular protein. This fraction
can  be  determined  by  separating  ribosomal  protein  from  all  other
cellular protein by electrophoresis or sedimentation and measuring the
radioactivity in each sample.

Regulation of Ribosome Synthesis

We already know that αr, during balanced exponential growth, is pro-
portional to the growth rate. Let us consider the response of αr during
a  transition  between  growth  rates.  Originally  this  type  of  data  was
sought in an effort to place constraints on the possible feedback loops
in the ribosome regulation system. By analogy to electronic circuits, the
response of the ribosome regulation system could be highly informative.
The most straightforward growth rate shift is generated by addition of
nutrients  supporting  faster  growth.  The  resulting  response  in αr  is  a
quick increase to the αr characteristic of the new growth conditions (Fig.
7.26). Superimposed on this shift are small oscillations. The existence
of these oscillations shows that a number of cellular components are
involved in the regulatory system. The ten-minute period of the oscilla-
tions suggests that at least one of the regulating components is not a

molecule  like  ATP  that  is  completely  turned  over  on  a  time  scale
appreciably less than ten minutes.

In addition to regulating ribosome synthesis in response to differing
growth rates, bacterial cells, and likely others as well, display a second
type of ribosome regulation. This is the stringent response, in which the
synthesis  of  ribosomal  RNA  and  tRNA  completely  stops  if  protein
synthesis  stops.  One  obvious  question  about  ribosome  regulation  is
whether  the  stringent  response  itself  is  joined to the  growth  rate  re-
sponse system. Studies have shown that mutants in the stringent system,
which  are  called  relaxed,  regulate  their  ribosome  levels  the  same  as
wild-type cells as growth rate is varied. Consequently, these two systems
are separate, as is verified by more recent experiments by Gourse.

The halt in the accumulation of rRNA in amino acid-starved, strin-
gent cells appears to result from decreased initiations by RNA polym-
erase rather than from degradation of rRNA or blockage of elongation
by  RNA  polymerase.  This  is  not  surprising  in  light  of  what  we  have
already discussed about regulation of DNA synthesis. One demonstra-
tion of this fact is that no radioactive rRNA is synthesized if amino acids,

rifamycin,  and  labeled  uridine  are  simultaneously  added  to  amino
acid-starved,  stringent  cells.  The  same  conclusion  is  also  reached  by
observing the kinetics of synthesis of the 16S and 23S rRNAs immedi-
ately after restoring the missing amino acid to an amino acid-requiring
strain.

During the stringent response, guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate,
ppGpp  (Fig.  7.27)  and  pppGpp,  accumulate  in  amino  acid-starved,
stringent cells but not in amino acid-starved, relaxed cells. These com-
pounds may directly interfere with transcription of the ribosomal RNA
genes.  In vitro  experiments  show  that  synthesis  of  ppGpp  requires  a
particular  protein,  ribosomes,  messenger,  and  an  uncharged  tRNA
corresponding to the codon of messenger in the A site of a ribosome
(Table 7.3). The required protein is normally rather tightly associated
with the ribosomes and is the product of a gene called relA.

Balancing Synthesis of Ribosomal Components

Although the synthesis of the individual components of ribosomes may
be  rather  well  regulated,  a  slight  imbalance  in  the  synthesis  of  one
component could eventually lead to elevated and potentially toxic levels
of that component. Synthesis of the ribosomal RNAs in bacteria are kept
in balance by a simple mechanism. As we have already seen in Chapter
5, these RNAs are synthesized in one piece by an RNA polymerase that
initiates at a promoter and transcribes across the genes for the three
RNAs. Different mechanisms are used to maintain balanced synthesis
of  some  of  the  ribosomal  proteins.  In  one  case,  one  of  the  proteins
encoded in a ribosomal protein operon reduces translation of all the
proteins in that operon. This effect is called translational repression.

The finding that a ribosomal protein represses translation of proteins
only from the same operon provides an efficient means for the cell to
maintain balanced synthesis of all the ribosomal proteins. Suppose that
some ribosomal proteins began to accumulate because their synthesis
is a little faster than the other proteins and the rRNA. Then, as the level
of these proteins begins to rise in the cytoplasm, they begin to repress

their own synthesis, and the system rapidly comes back to a balanced
state.

How do we know about translational repression? The main clue came
from careful measurements on cells with an increased number of genes
coding for some of the ribosomal proteins. The increased copy number
might have been expected to increase the synthesis of the corresponding
proteins, but it did not. The synthesis of the mRNA for these proteins
did increase as expected, and therefore it appeared that extra ribosomal
proteins in the cell inhibited translation of their own mRNA. Proof of
the idea of translational repression came from in vitro studies in which
levels of individual free ribosomal proteins could be adjusted at will.
The  addition  of  DNA  containing  genes  for  some  of  the  ribosomal
proteins and properly prepared cell extract permits transcription and
translation  to  yield  ribosomal  proteins  synthesized  in  vitro.  Nomura
found that addition of the appropriate free ribosomal proteins to such
a system repressed synthesis of the proteins encoded by the same operon
as the added protein.

Not  surprisingly,  a  ribosomal protein that regulates synthesis of a
group  of  proteins  binds  to  the  mRNA  to  effect  the  repression.  The
structure of the binding region on the mRNA for some of these proteins
is  the same  as  the structure  the  protein binds  to in the rRNA  in  the
ribosome.

Global limits can be placed on the accuracy with which the synthesis
of  ribosomal  components  is  balanced.  A  short  pulse  of  radioactive
amino acid is provided to the cells, and the total pool of all ribosomal
proteins can be determined by measuring the kinetics of incorporation
of label into mature ribosomes (Fig. 7.28). The results show that the
pool  contains  less  than  a  five-minute  supply  of  ribosomal  proteins.
Similarly,  the  pool  size  of  each  individual  ribosomal  protein  can  be

measured.  The  results  of  these  experiments  show  that  most  of  the
ribosomal proteins also have very small intracellular pools.

We  have  seen  that  the  mechanisms  regulating  ribosome  synthesis
have good reason to  be sophisticated, and, indeed those aspects that
have been investigated have turned out to be complicated. Much of the
biochemistry  and  perhaps  even  much  of  the  physiology  of  ribosome
regulation remain to be worked out. In bacteria and other single-celled
organisms such as yeast, it is likely that most of the regulation mecha -
nism can be dissected by a combination of physiology, genetics, and
biochemistry.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  if  analogous  problems  in
higher organisms can also be solved without the availability of genetics.

7.1. Look up the necessary data and calculate the turnover rate of
charged tRNA in growing E. coli. That is, how long would it take the
charged tRNA to become completely uncharged at the normal rates of
protein synthesis if charging were suddenly to stop?

7.2. On the basis of finding ribosomes with the enzymatic activity of
a  nascent  but  incomplete  peptide  chain  of  an  induced  enzyme,  it  is
sometimes claimed that proteins fold up as they are being synthesized.
Why is this reasoning inadequate and what experiments could defini-
tively determine the time between completion of synthesis of a polypep-
tide and its attainment of enzymatic activity? [Hint: Lactose is cleaved
to  glucose  and  galactose  by  the  inducible  enzyme  β-galactosidase.
Galactose  itself  is  metabolized  by  enzymes  of  another  inducible  op-
eron.]

7.3. In the experiment in which translation of Qβ RNA was blocked
by the prior binding of a oligonucleotide homologous to the Shine-Dal-
garno  sequence, it was found that f-met  tRNA could not bind  to  the
ribosomes. However, the trinucleotide, AUG, was able to bind. What is
the meaning of this finding and does it contradict the Shine-Dalgarno
hypothesis?

7.4.  How  did  N-formyl  methionine  come  to  be  discovered  as  the
initiating amino acid? Look up the references and describe the experi-
ments.

7.5.  Predict  several  tRNA  synthetases  that  will  activate  incorrect
amino acids and hydrolytically edit to reduce misacylation. Identify the
amino acids likely to be misactivated.

7.6. How do we know of the existence and properties of the A, P, and
E sites on ribosomes? Look up the necessary papers and describe the
experiments.

7.7.  Why  have  no  amber  suppressors  inserting  tryptophan  been

found?

7.8. A frameshift mutation is created by the insertion or deletion of
one or more bases that alter the triplet reading frame. The only mu-

Problems  219

tagens  that  generate  mutations  suppressing  the  effects  of  some  fra-
meshift  mutations  are  frameshift  mutagens.  Some  of  the  resulting
suppressors do not lie in the original gene. Propose an explanation and
an experiment to test your idea.

7.9. Suppressors for UAA, UAG, and UGA termination codons can be
created by single-base changes in the anticodon regions of tRNA genes.
What amino acids  could  be inserted  by suppressors  to  each of  these
termination signals? Despite energetic searches, not all of these possible
suppressors have been found. What are the suppressors that have been
found, and what is an explanation for the failure to find the rest?

7.10. With wobble permitted, what is the minimum number of tRNA

types that would be required to read all 61 sense codons?

7.11. In view of the fact that ribosomes can translate messenger as
fast as it appears, perhaps they could translate still faster if they didn’t
run up against the RNA polymerase.  What kinds of experiments could
show this doesn’t happen?

7.12. If transport of lactose into cells is unnecessary in a strain with
β-galactosidase relocated to the outer membrane by fusion to a maltose
transport protein, it appears strange that nature even bothers to have a
transport system for the lac system. Why wouldn’t it have been simpler
for nature to use a signal peptide to place β-galactosidase on the outer
membrane?

7.13. If the level of ribosomes is proportional to the growth rate, show
that the rate of synthesis of ribosomes is proportional to the square of
the growth rate.

7.14. At the ribosome translation efficiency normally seen in E. coli,

what is the absolute maximum growth rate possible?

7.15. Why is it reasonable that exposure of cells to low concentrations
of methanol would induce the synthesis of many of the same proteins
that are induced by exposure to excessively high temperatures?

7.16. Sketch a graph of the synthesis of additional rRNA in amino
acid-starved stringent cells on the restoration of amino acids, assuming
(a) that the block of synthesis was at the RNA polymerase initiation step,
and (b) that the block of synthesis was at an RNA chain elongation step,
that RNA polymerase molecules are randomly distributed through the
rRNA operons, and that they remain on the DNA during the starvation.
7.17. Overproduction of ribosomal proteins for structural studies was
found to make cells so sick that they could hardly grow. What is the
most likely explanation? 

7.18. Why might it be reasonable for a UGA (termination) codon to

exist within the gene encoding the R2 release factor?

Genetics

8

Thus  far  we  have  covered  the  structure  of  cells  and  the  structure,
properties, and synthesis of the components of major interest to mo-
lecular biologists–DNA, RNA, and proteins. We will now concern our-
selves with genetics. Historically, the study and formulation of many
genetic principles preceded an understanding of their chemical basis.
By  inverting  the  order,  however,  major  portions  of  genetics  become
easier to understand and can be covered in a single chapter.

Genetics was central to the development of the ideas presented in this
book  for  three  reasons.  First,  the  exchange  of  genetic  information
between cells or organisms and the ability to recombine this DNA by
cutting  and  splicing  is  widespread  in  nature.  This  means  that  these
phenomena must confer high survival value and therefore are of great
biological  importance.  Second,  for  many  years  genetics  was  at  the
center  of  research  in  molecular  biology,  first  serving  as  an  object  of
study and then as an aid to the study of the biochemistry of biological
processes. Now genetics in the form of genetic engineering has become
indispensable in the study of biological systems and in physical studies
of systems.

Historically, one reason for the study of genetics was to discover the
chemical basis of heredity. Naturally, the existence of mutations was
necessary to the execution of the classical experiments in genetics, and
an understanding of mutations will facilitate our study of these experi-
ments. We have already covered the chemical basis of heredity and the
basics of gene expression. Perhaps here we should explicitly state that
a gene refers to a set of nucleotides that specifies the sequence of an
RNA or protein. We will define mutation and in the next section mention

227

Mutations

228  Genetics

the  three  basic  types  of  mutations.  In  the  following  section  we  will
review the classical genetic experiments before turning to recombina-
tion.

A mutation is merely an inheritable alteration from the normal. It is
an alteration in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA or, in the case of
RNA viruses, an alteration in the nucleotide sequence of its genomic
RNA. We already know that changes in coding portions of DNA may
alter the amino acid sequences of proteins and that changes in noncod-
ing regions of DNA have the potential for changing the expression of
genes, for example by altering the strength of a promoter. Of course,
any cellular process that makes use of a sequence of DNA can be affected
by a mutation. The existence of mutations implies that the sequence of
DNA in living things, including viruses, is sufficiently stable that most
individuals  possess  the  same  sequence  but  sufficiently  unstable  that
alterations do exist and can be found.

The terms wild-type, mutant, mutation, and allele are closely related
but  must  be  distinguished.  Wild-type  is  a  reference,  usually  found
naturally. It can mean an organism, a set of genes, a gene, a gene product
like a protein, or a nucleotide sequence. A mutation is an inheritable
change from that reference. A mutant is the organism that carries the
mutation. Two mutations are said to be allelic if they lie in the same
gene. However, now that genes can be analyzed at the nucleotide level,
in some situations alleles refers to nucleotides rather than to genes.

Until it became possible  to sequence DNA easily, mutations  could
readily be identified only by their gross effects on the appearance of the
cell or the shape, color, or behavior of an organism. Some of the most
easily  studied  biological  effects  of  mutations  in  bacteria  and  viruses
were changes in the colony or plaque morphology. Other easily studied
effects of mutations were the inability of cells to grow at low or high
temperatures or the inability to grow without the addition of specific
chemicals to the growth medium. Such readily observed properties of
cells constitute their phenotype. The status of the genome giving rise to
the phenotype is called the genotype. For example, the Lac- phenotype
is the inability to grow on lactose. It can result from mutations in lactose
transport,  β-galactosidase  enzyme,  lac  gene  regulation,  or  the  cells’
overall regulation of classes of genes that are not well induced if cells
are grown in the presence of glucose. Such cells would have a mutation
in any of the following genes: lacY, lacZ, lacI, crp, or cya.

Point Mutations, Deletions, Insertions, and Damage

The structure  of DNA permits  only  three basic types  of alteration  or
mutation at a site: the substitution of one nucleotide for another, the
deletion of one or more nucleotides, and the insertion of one or more
nucleotides. A nucleotide substitution at a point is called a transition if
one purine is substituted for the other or one pyrimidine is substituted
for the other and is called a transversion if a purine is substituted for a
pyrimidine or vice versa.

In addition to substitutions of one nucleotide for another in single-
stranded DNA or one base pair for another in double-stranded DNA,
nucleotides  are  susceptible  to  many  types  of  chemical  modification.
These can include tautomerizations and deamination or more extensive
damage such as the complete loss of a base from the ribose phosphate
backbone (Fig. 8.1). The cellular repair mechanisms, however, remove
many such modified bases so that the gap can be refilled with normal
nucleotides. Those modified bases that escape repair cannot themselves
be passed on to the next generation because, on DNA replication, one
of the usual four nucleotides is incorporated into the daughter strand
opposite the altered base. Frequently the base so incorporated will be
incorrect, and consequently, a mutation is introduced at such a position.

Mutations arise from a variety of sources. As discussed in Chapter 3,
point mutations can occur spontaneously during replication of the DNA
through  the  misincorporation  of  a  nucleotide  and  the  failure  of  the
editing  mechanisms  to  correct  the  mistake  or  through  the  chemical
instability of the nucleotides. For example, cytosine can deaminate to
form uracil, which is then recognized as thymine during DNA replica-
tion.

230  Genetics

The frequency of spontaneous appearance of point mutations often
is too low for convenient experimentation, and mutagens are therefore
used to increase the frequency of mutants in cultures 10 to 1,000 times
above  the  spontaneous  frequency.  A  variety  of  mutagens  have  been
discovered, some by rational considerations and some by chance. Many
are nucleotide analogs that are incorporated into the DNA instead of the
normal  nucleotides.  These  increase  the  frequency  of  mispairing  in
subsequent rounds of DNA replication. Other mutagens are chemically
reactive  molecules  that  damage  or  modify  bases  in  DNA.  Ultraviolet
light  is  also  a  mutagen  as  discussed  earlier.  The  damage  it  creates
ultimately leads to mutations either through a reduced fidelity of syn-
thesis  or  an  elevated  probability  of  mistaken  repair  of  the  original
damage.  In  one  way or another, mutagens  increase  the frequency of
generating  mispaired  bases or  increase  the frequency that  mispaired
bases  escape  repair.  Ultimately,  either  leads  to  an  increase  in  the
probability that the original DNA sequence will be changed.

The mechanisms generating deletions and insertions are not as well
understood. Errors in DNA replication provide plausible mechanisms
for the generation of one or two base insertions or deletions. Most likely
slippage, perhaps stimulated by an appropriate sequence, will permit a

Figure 8.2  Two  mechanisms  for  generating  deletions  between  repeated  se-
quences. The first is looping with recombination between points within a single
chromosome, and the second is unequal crossing over between two chromo-
somes.

daughter strand to possess a different number of bases than the parent
strand.

Insertions and deletions larger than a few bases arise by a different
mechanism. The end points of a number of deletions in bacteria are
located at short, repeated or almost repeated sequences. The deletion
removes one of the repeats and the intervening sequence. We can picture
two plausible events that could create such deletions (Fig. 8.2). The first
is  a  looping  of  a  single  chromosome  followed  by  elimination  of  the
material between the two repeats. The second is similar to the first, but
it occurs between two chromosomes and transfers the material from
one chromosome to the other. One chromosome suffers a deletion and
the other an insertion.

The creation of deletions is also stimulated by the presence of some
genetic elements called insertion sequences or transposons. These ele-
ments transpose themselves or copies of themselves into other sites on
the chromosome. In the process they often generate deletions in their
vicinity.

Classical Genetics of Chromosomes

We should not proceed to a detailed discussion of molecular genetics
without a brief review of Mendelian genetics. Chromosomes in eukary-
otes consist mainly of DNA and histones. During some stages of the cell’s
division cycle in plants and animals, chromosomes can be observed with
light microscopes, and they display beautiful and fascinating patterns.
Careful  microscopic  study  of  such  chromosomes  sets  the  stage  for
subsequent molecular experiments that have revealed the exact chemi-
cal  nature  of  heredity.  We  are  now  approaching  a  similar  level  of
understanding of genetic recombination.

The  basis  of  many  of  the  classical  studies  is  that  most  types  of
eukaryotic cells are diploid. This means that each cell contains pairs of
identical or almost identical homologous chromosomes, one chromo-
some of each pair deriving from each of the parents. There are excep-
tions. Some types of plants are tetraploid or even octaploid, and some
variants of other species possess alternate numbers of one or more of
the chromosomes.

During normal cell growth and division, the pairs of chromosomes
in each dividing cell are duplicated and distributed to the two daughter
cells in a process called mitosis. As a result, each daughter cell receives
the same genetic information as the parent cell contained. The situation,
however, must be altered for sexual reproduction. During this process,
special cells derived from each of the parents fuse and give rise to the
new progeny. To maintain a constant amount of DNA per cell from one
generation to the next, the special cells, which are often called gametes,
are generated. These contain only one copy of each chromosome instead
of  the  two  copies  contained  by  most  cells.  The  normal  chromosome
number of two is called diploid, and a chromosome number of half this
is called haploid. The cell divisions giving rise to the haploid gametes in
animals and haploid spores in plants is called meiosis.

Figure 8.3  The classical view of meiosis.

During  the  process  of  meiosis,  a  pair  of  chromosomes  doubles,
genetic recombination may occur between homologous chromosomes,
and  the  cell  then  divides  (Fig.  8.3).  Each  of  the  daughter  cells  then
divides again without duplication of the chromosomes. The net result
is  four  cells,  each  containing  only  one  copy  of  each  chromosome.
Subsequent fusion of a sperm and egg cell from different individuals
yields  a  diploid  called  a  zygote  that  grows  and  divides  to  yield  an
organism containing one member of each chromosome pair from each
parent.

The chromosomes from each of the parents may contain mutations
that produce recognizable traits or phenotypes in the offspring. Let us
consider just one chromosome pair of a hypothetical organism. Let gene
A produce trait A, and, if it is mutant, let it be denoted as gene a and its
trait be a. In genetic terminology, A and a are alleles. We can describe
the genetic state of an individual by giving its genetic composition or
genotype.  For  example,  both  copies  of  the  chromosome  in  question
could contain the A allele. For convenience, denote this as (A/A). Such
a cell is called homozygous for gene A. A mating between organisms
containing diploid cells of type (A/A) and (a/a) must produce offspring
of  the  type  (a/A),  which  is,  of  course,  identical  to  (A/a).  That  is,  the
chromosomes in the offspring are copies of each of the parental chro -
mosomes. These offspring are said to be heterozygous for gene A.

The  interesting  results  come  when  two  heterozygous  individuals
mate and produce offspring. A gamete can inherit one or the other of
each  of  the  homologous  chromosomes  from  each  chromosome pair.
This  generates  a  variety  of  gamete  types.  When  large  numbers  of
offspring  are  considered,  many  representatives  are  found  of  every
possible combination of assortment of the chromosomes, and the re-
sults become predictable. It is easiest to systematize the possibilities in
a  square  matrix  (Fig.  8.4).  For  evaluation  of  experimental  results,
however, the appearance of heterozygotes must be known or deduced.
The appearance of a heterozygote (a/A) is that of trait A if A is dominant,
which means automatically that a is recessive. Strict dominance need
not be seen, and a heterozygote may combine the traits displayed by the
two alleles. For example, if the trait of gene A were the production of
red  pigment  in  flowers  and  the  trait  of  gene  a  were  the  absence  of
production of the pigment, the heterozygote (a/A) might produce half
the normal amount of red pigment and yield pink flowers.

Complementation, Cis, Trans, Dominant, and Recessive

Complementation, cis,  trans,  dominant,  and  recessive  are  commonly
used  genetic  terms.  Their meaning can be clarified  by  considering  a
simple set of two genes that are transcribed from a single promoter, an
operon. We shall consider the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Denote the
promoter by p and the three genes that code for proteins that diffuse
through the cell’s cytoplasm or membrane by lacZ, lacY, and lacA (Fig.
8.5). The lacZ gene codes for β-galactosidase. This is an enzyme that
hydrolyzes  lactose  to  produce  glucose  and  galactose.  The  lacY  gene
codes for a membrane protein that transports lactose into the cell, and
lacA codes for an enzyme that transfers acetyl groups to some galac-
tosides, thereby reducing their toxicity.

Diploids heterozygous for genes may easily be constructed by genetic
crosses in diploid eukaryotes and even in prokaryotes by special tricks.
If the genes are on phage genomes, cells may be simultaneously infected
with  both  phage  types.  Consider  the  lac  operon  and  possibilities  for
mutations in genes Z and Y. If we introduce the operon p +Z -Y + into cells
that are p +Z +Y -, the diploid p+Z-Y+/p+Z+Y- will possess good β-galactosi-
dase and transport protein, and phenotypically will be able to grow on
lactose. The Z + gene complements the Z - gene and the Y + gene comple-
ments the Y - gene. Both Z + and Y + act in trans and are trans dominant,
or simply dominant. Analogously, Z - and Y - are recessive.

A mutation in the promoter generates more complexity. A p - muta-
tion also appears to be Z - and Y - even though the  Z and Y genes retain
their normal sequences. This results from the fact that no β-galactosi-
dase or lactose transport protein can be synthesized if the lac promoter
is defective. In genetics terminology, such a strain is  phenotypically Z -
and Y- since, for growth purposes, it behaves as though it lacks the Z
and Y activities. However, it is genotypically p -, Z +, and Y+ since the Z
and Y genes actually remain intact, as may be revealed in other types of
experiments. In our example, the p element is cis dominant to the Z +
and Y + genes, that is, its effect is only over genes on the same piece of
DNA. Also, p + is not trans dominant to p- since a partial diploid of the
genetic structure p-Z+Y+/p+Z-Y+ would be unable to grow on lactose. The
presence of the Z + gene in a  p-Z+ chromosome could be revealed by
genetic recombination.

Mechanism of a trans Dominant Negative Mutation

Expression of the lac operon is regulated by the product of the lacI gene.
Since this protein acts to turn off or turn down the expression, it is called
a repressor. The protein can bind to a site partially overlapping the lac
promoter and block transcription from the promoter into the lac struc-
tural genes. In the presence of inducers, the repressor’s affinity for the
operator is much reduced and it dissociates from the DNA. This then
permits active transcription of the lac genes.

The repressor contains four identical subunits. Consider cells that are
diploid for lacI where one of the lacI genes is lacI+, and the other is a
type we call lacI-d. The d stands for “dominant.” During the synthesis of
the two types of repressor subunit in a cell, the probability that four
newly synthesized wild-type repressor subunits will associate to form a
wild-type tetramer is low. Instead, most repressor tetramers will possess
both types of subunits.

If the inclusion of a single I-d subunit in a tetramer interferes with the
function of a tetramer, then the I-d allele will be dominant and act in
trans to nullify the activity of the good lacI allele, that is, it is a trans
dominant negative mutation.

What is the physical basis for a single defective subunit inactivating
the remaining three nondefective subunits in a tetramer? Lac repressor
contacts the symmetrical lac operator with two subunits utilizing the
helix-turn-helix structure that was discussed in Chapter 6. Contact with
only one subunit provides far too little binding energy for the protein to
bind. Therefore a subunit with a defective DNA-contacting domain may
be capable of folding and oligomerizing with normal subunits, but its
incorporation into a tetramer will interfere with DNA binding since two
good subunits must simultaneously be involved in contacting the opera-
tor.

If a tetramer contains only one defective subunit, we might think that
two nondefective subunits could still be utilized for binding to DNA. To
an extent this is true. However, just as enhancers loop and complexes
of proteins can contact the DNA at two or more sites, so does the lac

operon. Looping in the lac operon brings repressor bound at the primary
operator into contact with either of two so-called  pseudo-operators on
either side. As will be discussed later, such looping can greatly increase
the occupancy of a binding site by a protein. In the case of the tetrameric
lac  repressor,  two  good  subunits could  contact  the lac  operator  or  a
pseudo operator, but looping could not occur, and the overall binding
would be relatively weak and as a result, repression would be poor (Fig.
8.6). Thus, the inclusion of a single DNA-binding defective subunit in a
tetrameric repressor can greatly interfere with repression.

Genetic Recombination

Genetic crosses between two strains, each containing a mutation in the
same  gene,  are  occasionally  observed  to  yield  nonmutant,  that  is,
wild-type, progeny. This is the result of a crossover in which the two
parental DNA molecules are precisely broken, exchanged, and rejoined.

Alignment of the pairs of homologous chromosomes during meiosis
has long been known through observations with light microscopes. The
subsequent movement of visually identifiable sites on the chromosomes
suggested  that  homologous  chromosomes  were  broken  and  portions
exchanged in a process called crossing over or recombination. Although
recombination was first observed in eukaryotic cells, it appears to be
almost ubiquitous. Even simple bacterial viruses can engage in genetic

recombination. The bacterial phage experiments were particularly im-
portant to the development of the field because phage provided a simple
and small system with few variables, a high sensitivity for recombinants,
and  a  very  short  generation  time.  These  properties  permitted  many
experiments to be done rapidly and inexpensively.

Phage mutants can easily be isolated that yield plaque morphologies
different from the normal or wild-type. This is done simply by plating
mutagenized  phage  on  cells  and  locating  the  occasional  different
plaque. Nonsense mutations in essential phage genes may be identified
as phage that grow only on nonsense-suppressing host cells. Genetic
recombination between phage can be revealed by co-infection of cells
with two mutants at a sufficiently high multiplicity of infection that each
cell is infected with both types of phage (Fig. 8.7). Some of the progeny
phage are found to carry alleles from both of the input phage! Since the
phage carry only one DNA copy, such progeny have to be recombinants
carrying  some  of  the  genetic  information  from  each  of  the  parental
phage types. The discovery of genetic recombination in phage by Del-
brück and Hershey opened the way for intensive study of the phenome-
non of genetic recombination at the molecular level.

Mapping by Recombination Frequencies

Two or more mutations on any DNA molecule that engages in recom-
bination can be approximately ordered along DNA molecules by meas-
urement of the frequencies of recombination. Let us examine why this
is so. Assume that the probability of a recombination or genetic cross -
over between two points on two almost homologous DNA molecules is
a function only of the distance between the points. Up to a limit, the
greater  the  separation,  the  greater  the  probability  of  crossover.  This
seems reasonable because increasing the separation increases the num-
ber of potential crossover sites. Recombination frequencies should be
additive if the frequency is linearly proportional to marker separation.
Thus, if Rf(X,Y) is the recombination frequency between markers X and

Y, and if strict additivity holds, Rf(A,C) must equal Rf(A,B) + Rf(B,C)
(Fig. 8.8).

Unfortunately, the assumption of a linear relation between recombi-
nation frequency and distance is not good over extremely short or long
distances. At short distances the specific nucleotides involved can gen-
erate profound effects on the recombination frequencies, and additivity
fails as a result. These short-distance anomalies are often called marker
effects.  At  large  distances  more  than  one  crossover  is  likely  in  the
distance  separating  two  markers.  If  an  even  number  of  crossovers
occurs between the markers, no net recombination is observed between
the markers. Therefore, as the distance between markers becomes large
and multiple crossovers occur, about as many partners experience an
even number of crossovers as experience an odd number. As only those
with odd numbers of crossovers generate recombinants, recombination
frequencies between two markers rise to 50% as an upper limit.

Given the vagaries of measuring distances by recombination frequen-
cies,  what  can  be  done?  Often  the  major  question  is  merely  one  of
marker order. The actual distances separating the markers are not of
great importance. Three-factor genetic crosses are a partial  solution.
They permit ordering of two genetic markers, B and C, with respect to
a third, A, that is known to lie on the outside. That is, the experiment is
to determine whether the order is A-B-C or A-C-B.

Here the crosses will be described as they are performed in prokary-
otes  in  which  only  one  of  the  two  participating  DNA  molecules  is  a
complete chromosome, but the basic principles apply for the situation
of recombination between two complete chromosomes. Mating experi-
ments permit the introduction of a portion of the chromosomal DNA
from  a  donor  bacterial  cell  into  a  recipient  cell  in  a  process  called
bacterial conjugation. As a result of the inviability of such a linear DNA
fragment, if a crossover occurs between the chromosome of the recipi-
ent and the incoming chromosome fragment, a second crossover be-
tween the two DNAs must also occur for the recipient chromosome not
to be left open by the single crossover event (Fig. 8.9). In general, any
even number of total crossovers between the incoming DNA and the
recipient chromosome will yield viable recombinants.

238  Genetics

Figure 8.9  In  order  that  a  circular  chromosome  not  be  opened  by  genetic
recombination, two crossovers between it and a fragment of linear DNA are
necessary.

The genetic markers involved in the genetic cross, A, B, and C, can be
different genes or different alleles within the same gene. In principle it
does  not matter,  but  in practice it could be  difficult  to ascertain  the
different varieties of recombinants if the markers all lie within the same
gene.

To determine the gene order, compare the fraction of B+C + recombi-
nants among all the A+ recombinants in the two crosses (Fig. 8.10), first
between an A-B-C+ chromosome and an A+B+C- DNA fragment, and then
between an A-B+C - chromosome and an A+B-C + fragment. If the gene
order is ABC, then generation of B+C+ recombinants from the first cross
requires only two crossover events, whereas the second cross requires
crossovers in the same two intervals as the first plus an additional two
crossovers.  Therefore  the  fraction  of  the  B+C+  recombinants  will  be
much higher from the first cross. Alternatively, if the gene order is ACB,

Mapping by Deletions

Deletions  may  also  be  used  in  genetic  mapping.  The  recombination
frequency for generating functional genes is not measured in this type
of mapping. Instead, all that is asked is whether or not a deletion and a
point mutation can recombine to yield a functional gene. If they can,
then the deletion must not have removed the nucleotide allelic to the
point mutation.

Consider  a  series  of  strains  each  containing  a  deletion  or  a  point
mutation. Suppose the point mutations lie within a gene X and that the
deletions all begin beyond the left end of X and extend various distances
rightward into X (Fig. 8.11). If a diploid between ∆1 and point mutation
A can yield an X+ recombinant, then A must lie to the right of the end
point of ∆1. If A also fails to yield X+ recombinants with ∆2, then ∆2 ends
to the right of A and hence to the right of ∆1. By this type of reasoning,
a completely unordered set of deletions and point mutations may be
ordered.

Heteroduplexes and Genetic Recombination

Having considered the existence and use of genetic recombination, we
are ready to consider how it comes about. Genetic recombination yields
a precise cut and splice between two DNA molecules. Even if one DNA

somes during the process of genetic
recombination.

molecule were to have been cut, it is hard to imagine how an enzyme
could know where to cut the other DNA duplex so as to produce the
perfect splices that genetics experiments show occur. The difficulty can
be largely overcome by a mechanism utilizing the self-complementary
double-stranded structure of DNA. A denatured portion of one duplex
could anneal to a denatured portion of complementary sequence from
the other duplex (Fig. 8.12). This would hold the two DNA molecules in
register while the remainder of the recombination reaction proceeded.
The  life  cycle  of  yeast  permits  a  direct  test  of  the  model  outlined
above.  A  diploid  yeast  cell undergoes  recombination during  meiosis,
and the two meiotic cell divisions yield four haploid spores. These four
spores can be isolated from one another and each can be grown into a
colony or culture. In essence, the cells of each colony are identical copies
of  each  of  the  original  recombinants,  and  the  cells  can  be  tested  to
determine the genetic structure of the original recombinants. If one of
a pair of homologous chromosomes contains a mutation and the other
does  not,  generally  two  of  the  four  resulting  spores  will  contain  the
mutation and two will not.

Consider  the  situation  resulting  from  melting  portions  of  the  du-
plexes and base pairing between complementary strands of two homolo-
gous yeast chromosomes in the process of genetic recombination. The
region of pairing may include the mutation. Then a heteroduplex forms
that  contains  the  mutant  sequence  on  one  strand  and  the  wild-type
sequence on the other (Fig. 8.13). As discussed in Chapter 3, mispaired
bases are subject to mismatch repair and, if it occurs, the yeast repair
system in this case has no apparent reason to choose one strand to repair
in  preference  to  the  other.  Therefore  strands  may  be  correctly  or
incorrectly repaired, so the final outcome could be three copies of the
wild-type or mutant sequence and one copy of the other in the meiosis
from a single yeast cell. In total, a single yeast cell can produce one or
three progeny spores containing the marker from one of the original
chromosomes. This phenomenon is called gene conversion. It is experi-
mentally  observed  and  consequently  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that
pairing between complementary strands of recombinant partners oc-
curs during recombination. Without heteroduplex formation and mis-
match repair, there is no easy way to generate any ratio other than 2:2.

 Branch Migration and Isomerization

Evidence mentioned in the previous section suggests that DNA duplexes
engaged in recombination are likely to involve heteroduplexes consist-
ing of one DNA strand from each parent. The problem we will address
here is one way these heteroduplexes might be formed and what steps
might be necessary to convert them to recombinants. As a glance at any
genetics book will show, there are many schemes consisting of more or
less reasonable steps that conceivably could be catalyzed by enzymes
and that would ultimately lead to the generation of genetic recombina-
tion. We will outline one of these.

242  Genetics

A single-stranded end of a DNA molecule can invade a DNA duplex
in a region of homology and form a DNA heteroduplex by displacing
one  of  the  strands  of  the  invaded  parent.  This  can  occur  because

negatively  supercoiled  DNA  is  under  torsion  to  untwist, and  thereby
melt  a  portion  of  duplex.  Displacement  of  a  portion  of  the  original
duplex  by an  invading  single  strand of DNA is  energetically favored.
Thus, once this has started, additional nucleotides from the invading
strand are free to base pair because for each base pair broken in the
parental duplex, a new pair forms in the heteroduplex. Then the cross-
over point is free to drift in either direction along the DNA by this branch
migration process.

Before  proceeding  with  the  recombination  mechanism,  we  must
consider a diversion. For simplicity we will examine a double crossover
and then apply the principles to the situation described in the previous
paragraph. The strands that appear to cross from one duplex over to the
other are not fixed! What is the basis of this remarkable assertion? By
a  simple  reshuffling  of  the  DNA  in  the  crossover  region,  the  other
strands can be made to appear to be the ones crossing over (Fig. 8.14).
This  reshuffling  is  called isomerization.  To understand,  consider  the
more dramatic transformations as shown in the Figure. These result in
a change in the pair of strands that cross from one duplex to the other.
In reality, however, they amount to little more than looking at the DNA

series  of  rotations  as  indicated

from  a  different  angle.  Isomerization  requires  only  minor  structural
shifts  in  the  crossover  region  and  therefore  is  free  to  occur  during
genetic recombination.

Now let us return to the crossover mechanism. At the one crossover
stage, an isomerization yields a two strand crossover (Fig. 8.15). Branch
migration followed by cleavage of these strands then produces a cross-
over between the two parental duplexes with a heteroduplex region near
the crossover point.

Elements of Recombination in E. coli, RecA, RecBCD, and Chi

What  types  of  biochemical  evidence  can  be  found  in  support  of  the
mechanisms of recombination discussed in the previous section? His-
torically, the elucidation of metabolic pathways was often assisted by
the isolation of mutations in enzymes catalyzing individual steps of the
pathway. With similar objectives in mind, mutations were isolated that
decreased or increased the ability of phage, E. coli, yeast, and some other
organisms to undergo recombination. Subsequently, the enzyme prod-
ucts  of  the  recombination  genes  from  E.  coli  and  yeast  have  been
identified and purified. Of greatest importance to recombination are the
RecA and RecBCD proteins. Additional enzyme activities that might be
expected to play roles, such as DNA ligase, DNA polymerases, single-
stranded binding protein, and proteins that wind or unwind DNA, have
already been discussed and will not be further mentioned here.

RecA mutants are unable to engage in genetic recombination, and as
expected, the purified RecA protein possesses a variety of activities that
appear  related  to  recombination.  In  the presence of ATP the  protein
binds to single-stranded DNA in a highly cooperative manner. Once one
molecule has bound to a stretch of single-stranded DNA, other mole-

cules  line up  beside it.  Then, with  the  hydrolysis  of  ATP the  protein
catalyzes  the  pairing  of  a  homologous  DNA  strand  from  a  double-
stranded duplex to the strand covered with RecA protein.

The known activities of the RecBCD protein suggest that this protein
generates the single-stranded regions that initiate the strand invasion
process catalyzed by RecA. RecBCD protein binds at the free end of a
double-stranded DNA duplex and moves down the DNA separating the
DNA  strands  and  leaving  a  single-stranded  region  in  its  wake.  If  it
encounters a specific eight nucleotide sequence called a chi sequence,
the enzyme cleaves one of the strands, leaving a single-stranded DNA
end that can be covered with RecA protein and initiate recombination
(Fig. 8.16).

Chi can stimulate recombination at distances up to 10,000 bases away
from itself and appears to act only in one direction from itself, that is,
it possesses a polarity. Only when chi is crossed by RecBCD traveling in
one  direction  does  cleavage  occur.  Apparently  organisms  other  than
bacteria  utilize  sequences  that  function  like  chi,  since  hotspots  of
genetic recombination are found in yeast and fungi as well. The fact that
RecBCD  can  enter  DNA  only  at  an  end  restricts  its  stimulation  of
recombination  to  those  situations  in  which  ends  are  generated.  In
addition to random chromosome breakage, in which case genetic re-
combination may be a good way to attempt rescue, ends are generated
during transfer of genetic information. The rate of genetic recombina-
tion between homologous DNA sequences during normal growth is very
low. Recombination primarily occurs at the time of introduction of new
DNA into bacteria. The analogous principle applies to meiosis of eu-
karyotic cells, but the recombination stimulating process there is not
yet known.

Genetic Systems

One of the early steps in the investigation of biological problems is to
determine roughly the complexity of the system by genetic experiments.
Mutations affecting the system are isolated, their effects are determined,

Growing Cells for Genetics Experiments   245

and in some cases the mutations are mapped. Earlier in the chapter we
considered  these  questions  in  the  abstract.  Here  we  shall  examine
experimentally how these questions may be handled in bacteria, yeast,
and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The same basic operations
used with bacteria or yeast are also used with most other unicellular
organisms or with cell cultures from multicellular organisms. Similarly,
the principles and genetic operations used with Drosophila are similar
to  many  used  with  other  higher  organisms,  although  the  Drosophila
genetic system is much more tractable than other systems.  

Phage  and  bacteria  have  been  important  in  molecular  biology  for
many reasons. Among them is the fact that with these materials genetic
experiments can easily be performed, and, most importantly, mutants
can be grown and their altered genes or gene products can be isolated
and definitively tested in biochemical experiments.

Yeast possess many of the virtues of bacteria. As a simple eukaryote
however,  many  of  the  important  questions  being  studied  with  yeast
involve components  or  processes which are not found in  bacteria  or
phage,  for  example,  properties  of  mitochondria  or  messenger  RNA
splicing. One of the most useful properties of this organism is the ease
of generating haploids and diploids. The facile generation of mutants
requires  use  of  the  haploid  form,  but  complementation  studies  and
genetic mapping require forming diploids.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been energetically studied
by  geneticists  since  about  1910.  It  is  a  eukaryote  with  differentiated
tissues and is relatively easy and inexpensive to study. A large number
of mutations as well as a wide variety of chromosome aberrations such
as  inversions,  substitutions,  and  deletions  have  been  catalogued  and
mapped in this organism. Fortunately Drosophila permits the study of
many of these rearrangements with the light microscope as the chro-
mosomes in the salivary glands are highly polytene. They contain about
1,000 parallel identical copies. This large amount of DNA and associated
macromolecules generates banding patterns characteristic of each re-
gion of the chromosome. The mechanisms of tissue-specific gene ex-
pression and growth and operation of the nervous system are questions
appropriate for this organism. Remarkably powerful genetics tools have
been developed for investigating these questions in Drosophila. On the
other hand, biochemical approaches to these questions are just begin-
ning to be developed, as will be described in following chapters.

Growing Cells for Genetics Experiments 

A culture should be genetically pure before one attempts to isolate a new
mutant or to study the properties of an existing mutant. Being geneti-
cally pure means that all the cells of a culture are genetically identical.
The easiest way to ensure the requisite purity is to grow cultures from
a single cell. Then, all the cells will be descendants of the original cell,
and the culture will be pure unless the spontaneous mutation rate is
excessive.

246  Genetics

The species of bacteria most widely used in molecular biology experi-
ments is Escherichia coli. It can be simply purified by streaking a culture
on a petri plate containing “rich” nutrient medium consisting of many
nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, and vita-
mins. These plates permit growth of virtually all Escherichia coli nutri-
tional  mutants,  and  wild-type,  as  well  as  many  other  types  of  cells.
Streaking is performed by sterilizing a platinum needle, poking it into
a colony or culture of cells and lightly dragging it across an agar surface
so that at least a few of the deposited cells are sufficiently isolated that
they will grow into isolated, and therefore pure, colonies. Essentially,
the only modification in the above procedure necessary for other cell-
types is to use appropriate media. Often cells from higher organisms
display a density-dependent growth and will not divide unless the cell
density is above a critical value. Then the isolation of a culture from a
single  cell  requires  the  use  of  tiny  volumes.  One  method  is  to  use
microdrops  suspended  from  glass  cover  slips.  Evaporation  from  the
drops is prevented by placing the cover slips upside down over small
chambers  filled  with  the  growth  medium.  The  analog  of  beginning
bacterial genetics experiments from a single cell is beginning genetics
experiments on multicellular organisms with isogenic parents. Highly
inbred laboratory strains serve such a purpose.

Testing Purified Cultures, Scoring 

Once a strain has been purified, its phenotype can be tested. Suppose,
for example, that a desired bacterial strain is claimed to be unable to
use lactose as a sole source of carbon and to be unable to synthesize
arginine. What is the simplest way to test or score for Lac- Arg-? One
satisfactory growth medium for the mutant would be a medium con-
+, and other trace
taining K+, Na+, PO4
elements which are present as chemical contaminants of these ingredi-
ents, plus glucose at a concentration of 2 gm/liter and L-arginine at 0.1
gm/liter.  This  is  called  a  minimal  salts  medium  with  glucose  and
arginine. Each candidate colony could be spotted with sterile wooden

sticks or toothpicks onto minimal salts medium containing the follow-
ing additions: glucose, glucose plus arginine, and lactose plus arginine.
The desired strain should grow only on glucose plus arginine medium
(Table 8.1).

Isolating Auxotrophs, Use of Mutagens and Replica Plating

Consider the isolation of a bacterial strain requiring leucine as a growth
supplement added to the medium. A spontaneously arising Leu- mutant
might exist in a population at a frequency of about 10-6. One method of
finding or isolating such a leucine-requiring mutant would be to dilute
cells  to  a  concentration  of  about  1,000  cells/ml  and  spread  0.1  ml
quantities on  the surface  of 10,000 glucose plus  leucine plates.  After
these had grown, each of the 1,000,000 colonies could be spot tested for
a  leucine  requirement.  By  this  method  one  spontaneously  occurring
Leu-  mutant  out  of  106  cells  could  be  found.  This  is  not  a  workable
method, however, and when faced with problems like this, geneticists
devised many shortcuts.

One way to decrease the work of finding a mutant is to increase its
frequency  of  occurrence. Standard  techniques  for increasing  the fre-
quency  of mutants in a population are treatment with chemical mu-
tagens,  exposure  to  UV  light,  or  the  use  of  mutator  strains.  The
spontaneous mutation frequency in such strains is greatly elevated, for
example due to mutations in DNA polymerase. Another shortcut is to
reduce the time required  to spot many colonies in  the scoring steps.
Replica  plating  allows  spotting  all  the  colonies  from  a  plate  in  one
operation onto a testing plate. This can be done with a circular pad of
sterile velvet or paper which is first pushed against the master plate of
colonies. The paper or velvet picks up many cells which can then be
deposited onto a number of replica plates.

In some situations the use of a mutagen might be unwise due to the
possibility  of  introducing  more  than  one  mutation  into  the  strain.
Therefore,  a  spontaneously  occurring  Leu-  mutant  might  have  to  be
found. Even  with  replica  plating,  this could  entail much work  and a
method of selectively killing all the Leu+ cells in the culture would be
most valuable.

Penicillin provides a useful reverse selection for bacterial mutants.
Ordinarily, mutants capable  of growing  in a particular medium may
easily be selected. The reverse, the selection for the mutants unable to
grow in a particular medium, requires a trick. Penicillin provides an
answer.  This  antibiotic  blocks  the  correct  formation  of  the  peptide
crosslinks in the peptidoglycan layer. Walls synthesized in the absence
of  these  crosslinks  are  weak.  Only  growing  cells  synthesize  or  try  to
synthesize  peptido-glycan.  Therefore,  in  the  presence  of  penicillin,
growing cells synthesize defective walls and are lysed by osmotic pres-
sure. Non-growing cells survive. A penicillin treatment can increase the
fraction of Leu- cells in the population 1000-fold. That is, a penicillin
treatment can select for Leu- cells.

248  Genetics

In practice, a culture of the desired cells is grown on minimal medium
containing leucine, and then the leucine is removed either by filtration
or centrifugation. The cells are resuspended in medium lacking leucine,
and penicillin is added. The Leu+ cells continue growing and are killed
by  the  penicillin  whereas  the  Leu-  cells  stop  growing  and  remain
resistant to the penicillin. The penicillin is removed and the surviving
cells are plated out for spot testing to identify the Leu- colonies.

Genetic Selections 

In the preceding section we saw the use of penicillin for the selection of
Leu- mutants. Here we will further discuss genetic selections. Selective
growth of mutants means using conditions in which the desired mutant
will grow, but the remainder of the cells, including the wild-type parents
will not. This is to be contrasted with scoring, in which all the cells grow
and the desired mutant is identified by other means. Often in scoring,
all the cells are plated out to form colonies. These are then spotted onto
various media on which the mutant may be identified or are grown for
assay of various gene products. A simple example of selecting a desired
mutant  would  be  isolating  a  Lac+  revertant  from  a  Lac-  mutant  by
plating the cells on minimal plates containing lactose as the sole source
of carbon. Up to 1011 cells could be spread on a single plate in search of
a single Lac+ revertant.

A slightly more complicated mutant selection is the use of an agent
whose metabolism will create a toxic compound. Cleavage of orthoni-
trophenyl-β-D-thiogalactoside  by  the enzyme β-galactosidase  yields  a
toxic compound and cells die. Thus Lac+ cells expressing β-galactosi-
dase  in  a  medium  containing  glycerol  and  orthonitrophenyl-β-D-
thiogalactoside are killed and only Lac- cells survive (Fig. 8.17).

Let  us  examine  a  more  complicated  selection,  the  isolation  of  a
nonsense mutation in the β subunit of RNA polymerase. Such a muta-
tion would be lethal under normal circumstances since RNA polymerase
is an essential enzyme and a nonsense mutation terminates translation
of the elongating polypeptide chain. Tricks can be devised however, so
that the desired mutant can be identified if the cells contain a tempera-
ture-sensitive nonsense suppressor, Sup+(ts). Such a suppressor results
from  a  mutant  tRNA  that  suppresses  nonsense  codons,  but  loses  its

subunit of RNA polymerase.

suppressing  activity  at  42°,  a  temperature  at  which  Escherichia  coli
normally  survives.  The  selection  also  utilizes  the  RNA  polymerase
inhibitor, rifamycin.

Two facts are key to the selection: first, that rifamycin sensitivity is
dominant to rifamycin resistance, and second, that rifamycin-resistant
mutants possess altered β subunits of RNA polymerase. One might have
thought that resistance would be dominant to sensitivity, for it would
seem that the rifamycin-resistant polymerase in a cell could function
despite the presence of the sensitive polymerase. Problem 8.20 asks why
sensitive polymerase is dominant to resistant polymerase. The first step
in selecting the desired mutant is to mutagenize Arg- Rif s Sup+(ts) Smr
(streptomycin-resistant) cells and to grow them at the low temperature
of  30°.  Under  these  conditions,  a  nonsense  mutation  in  the  rif  allele
would  not  be  lethal  since  the  suppressor  would  be  active  and  the
complete β chain of polymerase would be synthesized (Fig. 8.18).

After the first step, a region of the chromosome containing the Arg+
Rifr genes could be introduced by mating with an appropriate Sms strain
containing  an  Arg-Rif  episome  (see  later  section  for  episomes).  By
selecting for growth in the absence of arginine and presence of strepto-
mycin, cells diploid for this region could be selected. The majority of
the cells which grow will then have the genotype Arg+ Rifr/ Arg- Rifs
Sup+(ts)  Smr,  in  which  the  genes  before  the  “/ ”  represent  episomal
genes. Among these will be a few of the desired genotype, Arg+ Rifr/Arg-
Rifs(amber) Sup+. Since rifamycin sensitivity is dominant to rifamycin
resistance, the cells with the amber mutation in the β subunit will be
rifamycin-resistant at 42° whereas the others will remain rifamycin-sen-

250  Genetics

sitive. The desired cells, but not most of the other types, would be able
to  grow  at  42°  on  minimal  medium  lacking  arginine  and  containing
rifamycin.  One  of  the  nondesired  mutant  types  would  be  those  with
missense mutations in the β subunit. How could these be distinguished
from  those  with  nonsense  mutations  in  β?  The  answer  is  that  the
missense  mutations  would  remain  rifamycin-resistant  even  at  30°,
whereas the amber mutants would become rifamycin-sensitive!

Mapping with Generalized Transducing Phage 

As we have already discussed in Chapter 3, coliphage P1 is imperfect in
its encapsulation process, and instead of packaging P1 DNA with com-
plete fidelity, a small fraction of the phage package a segment of their
host’s  DNA.  Upon  infection  of  sensitive  cells  with  such  a  lysate,  the
majority of infected cells are injected with a phage DNA molecule. A
small fraction of the cells however, are injected with a segment of the
chromosome of the cells on which the phage lysate was prepared. This
DNA segment cannot permanently survive in the cells since it lacks a
DNA replication origin and furthermore, exonucleases would degrade
it. It is free to engage in genetic recombination before it is degraded.
This type of transfer of genetic markers via a phage is called generalized
transduction.

The  ability  to  transduce  cells  with  a  phage  like  P1  facilitates  fine
structure genetic mapping. Three factor crosses may be performed with
phage P1 to determine the order of genetic markers regardless of the
sex of the cells rather than being restricted to using donor and receptor
cell lines for bacterial conjugation. Even more useful, however, are the
consequences  of  the  fact  that  the  length  of  DNA  which  a  P1  phage
particle carries is only 1% the size of the bacterial chromosome. There-
fore, the frequency with which two genetic markers are simultaneously
carried in a single transducing phage particle is high if they are sepa-
rated by much less than 1% of the chromosome. This frequency falls as
the separation between two markers increases, and it becomes zero if
they are so widely separated that a segment of DNA carrying both alleles
is too large to be encapsulated. As a result, the frequency of cotransduc-
tion  of  two  genetic  markers  provides  a  good  measurement  of  their
separation.

Cotransduction  frequency  often  is  easy  to  measure.  For  example,
other experiments could have indicated that the genes for synthesis of
leucine and the genes permitting utilization of the sugar arabinose were
closely  spaced  on  the  chromosome.  P1  mapping  can  measure  their
separation more accurately. P1 could be grown on an Ara + Leu+ strain
and used to transduce an Ara- Leu- strain to Ara+ by spreading the P1
infected cells on agar containing minimal salts, arabinose as a carbon
source, and leucine. Then, the Ara+ transductants could be scored by
spot testing for the state of their leucine genes.

Principles of Bacterial Sex 

Principles of Bacterial Sex   251

Lederberg and Tatum discovered that some bacterial strains can trans-
fer DNA to recipient cells, that is, they can mate. This discovery opened
the doors for two types of research. First, genetic manipulations could
be used to assist other types of studies involving bacteria, and through-
out  the  book  we  shall  see  many  examples  of  the  assistance  genetics
provides to biochemical, physiological, and physical studies. Second,
the mechanism of bacterial mating itself was interesting and could be
investigated. In this section we shall review the actual mechanism of
bacterial mating.

Maleness is conferred upon cells when they contain a mating module
called the F-factor. F stands for fertility. This module is a circular DNA
molecule containing about 25 genes involved with conjugation. One of
the  F  genes  codes  for  the  major  protein  of  the  F-pilus.  This  is  an
appendage essential for DNA transfer. Other genes code for additional
parts of the F-pilus, its membrane attachment, and DNA replication of
F-factor DNA. The system also contains at least one regulatory gene.

F-pilus contact with a suitable female activates the mating module.
As a result, a break is made within the F sequences of DNA and a single
strand  of  DNA  synthesized  via  the  rolling  circle  replication  mode  is
transferred into the female (Fig. 8.19). Immediately upon entry of the
single strand into the female, the complementary strand is synthesized.
If no breakage occurs during transfer, all the F-factor DNA, including
the portion initially left behind at the break, can be transferred into the
female cell. The F-factor thus codes for transfer into female cells of itself
and also any DNA to which it is connected. If the F-factor is integrated
within the chromosome, then its mobilization in conjugation transfers
the chromosome as well as itself. Cells which transfer their chromoso -
mal genes to recipient cells are called Hfr for high frequency of recom-
bination, whereas the cells which contain F-factors separate from the
chromosome are called F or F’, and the females are called F-.

  A  little  over  100  minutes  are  required  for  transfer  of  the  entire
Escherichia coli chromosome to a female. Genes located anywhere on
the  chromosome  can  be  mapped  by  determining  the  timing  of  their

transfer to female cells. To do this mating is initiated by mixing male
and female cells. Genetic markers on one side of the F-factor will be
transferred to the female cells with only a few minutes of mating, while
markers on the opposite side of the chromosome will not be transferred
for over half an hour.

Random breakage of the DNA during mating from an Hfr to an F-
often interrupts the transfer so that only infrequently can the complete
chromosome be transferred. This is a blessing in disguise however, for
in addition to the time of transfer, the frequency of a marker’s transfer
also indicates its chromosomal position with respect to the integrated
F-factor.  More  than  one  integration  site  of  F  has  been  found  on  the
chromosome, so that a variety of origins of transfer are available and
the entire chromosome can be easily mapped. Once mating has been
started and been allowed to proceed for a period of time, any further
transfer of markers can be stopped merely by vigorously shaking the
culture to separate the mating couples.

A mating experiment might be performed in the following way. Male
Arg+ Gal+ Leu+ Sms (streptomycin-sensitive) and female Arg- Gal- Leu-
Smr cells would be grown to densities of about 1 × 108 per ml and mixed
together in equal portions. The cells would then be shaken very gently.
At intervals, a sample of cells would be taken, vigorously shaken so as
to separate mating couples and dilutions spread on streptomycin-con-
taining medium so as to select for Arg+ or Gal+ or Leu+ Smr recombi-
nants (Fig. 8.20).

F-factors  facilitate  genetic  study  with  Escherichia  coli  in  a  second
way. They need not be associated with the chromosome. Instead, they
can be autonomous DNA elements existing alongside the chromosome.
The transfer properties remain the same for an F-factor in this position,
but the genetics are slightly altered in two ways. First, the extra-chro-
mosomal F-factor can have some chromosomal genes associated with
it, in which case it is called an F’-factor. Presumably these genes were

Elements of Yeast Genetics   253

picked up at an earlier time by an excision of the integrated F-factor
from  the  chromosome  of  an  Hfr  cell.  The  second  alteration  of  an
extrachromosomal F-factor is that often the entire mating module and
attached  genes  are  transferred  to  a  female.  As  a  result,  the  female
acquires a functional F-factor with its associated genes and becomes
diploid for a portion of the chromosome as well as becoming capable
of transferring copies of the same F’ on to other female cells.

Elements of Yeast Genetics 

Yeast contain about 1.5 × 107 base pairs of DNA per cell, about five times
the  amount  per  bacterium.  Baker’s  yeast,  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,
contains  16  chromosomes.  Consequently,  most  are  substantially
smaller than the E. coli chromosome.

As already mentioned, yeast can be found as haploids or diploids.
This property greatly facilitates mutation isolation and genetic analysis,
and, combined with the small chromosome size, makes yeast a good
choice for experiments which require eukaryotic cells. A diploid yeast
cell can grow in culture much like a bacterium, although Saccharomyces
divide  not  in  half  like  bacteria,  but  generate  daughter  buds  which
enlarge and finally separate from the mother cell (Fig. 8.21). As men-
tioned earlier in this chapter, in contrast to E. coli, but like some other
bacteria, yeast can sporulate. This occurs if they are starved of nitrogen
in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source like acetate. In this
24 hour process, a single diploid yeast cell undergoes meiosis and forms
an ascus containing four spores. Upon incubation in rich medium, the
spores germinate and grow as haploid yeast cells.

If one of the spores is isolated from an ascus and grown up separate
from other spores, the resulting culture is different from the parental
culture. The cells are haploid and they cannot sporulate. In fact, an ascus
contains two types of spores. These are designated as mating-types, a
and αααα. Both of these generate the haploid cultures and cannot sporulate.

254  Genetics

If, however, a and αααα cultures are mixed, cells of opposite mating-type
adhere and form mating pair aggregates. First the cytoplasms of these
pairs fuse, and then the nuclei fuse to generate diploid cells which grow
and remain diploids. The diploids then can sporulate and regenerate the
haploids of mating-types a and αααα.

Recombination can be used for genetic mapping in yeast much as it
is used in bacteria. Since no yeast viruses are known, genetic transfer
must  be  accomplished  either  by  the  fusion  of  haploids  as  described
above or by direct DNA transfer as described in a later chapter on genetic
engineering.  Genetic  recombination  occurs  during  both  meiosis  and
mitosis, but is much more frequent in meiosis.

Elements of Drosophila Genetics

Genetics can profitably be applied to the study of the development of
tissues and tissue-specific gene expression as well as behavior, vision,
muscle  and  nerve  function  in  Drosophila. The  Drosophila  genome  of
about 1.65 × 108 base pairs of DNA is contained in four chromosomes.
Chromosomes II, III, and IV are normally found as pairs, while in males
the constitution of the fourth chromosome is XY and in females it is
XX. Unlike yeast, there is no simple way to make haploid fruit flies, and
therefore the genes which are located on chromosomes II, III, and IV
are more difficult to study. The genes located on chromosome X may
easily  be  studied,  for  males  are  haploid  for  the  X  chromosome  and
females are diploid. Therefore recessive mutations in genes located on
the  X  chromosome  will  be  expressed  in  males,  and  the  ability  of
X-located genes to complement can be tested in females.

Once a mutation is generated in the DNA of a bacterium, one of the
daughter cells usually is capable of expressing the mutation. The analog
is also true in Drosophila. However, the equivalent of a cell division in
bacteria  is  the  next  generation  in  Drosophila.  An  adult  fly  can  be
mutagenized, but many of its genes are expressed only during develop-
ment. Therefore this adult will not express the mutation.  Mutagenized
adults  must  be  mated  and  their  progeny  must  be  examined  for  the
desired mutation. One straightforward way to mutagenize flies is to feed
them a 1% sucrose solution containing ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS).
If  male  flies  are  mutagenized  and mated  with  females, four  types  of

progeny are obtained. In the first generation only females could contain
a mutagenized X chromosome. If these females are collected and mated
again with unmutagenized males, then in the second generation half of
the males have a chance of receiving and expressing a mutagenized X

chromosome.  Much  tedious  sorting  of  males  and  females  could  be
required for the detection of rare mutants.

Isolating Mutations in Muscle or Nerve in Drosophila 

How  could  mutations  in  muscle  or  nerve  be  isolated?  Since  these
mutations could be lethal, we ought to seek conditional mutations. That
is, the mutation ought to be expressed only under special conditions,
for example at elevated temperature. Suzuki developed ingenious meth-
ods for the isolation of temperature-sensitive paralytic mutations. The
flies  we  seek  ought  to  be  perfectly  normal  at  low  temperature,  be
paralyzed at high temperature, and recover rapidly when returned to
low temperature. Undoubtedly such  mutations would be exceedingly
rare, and great numbers of flies would have to be screened in order to
find a few candidate mutants. Such large numbers necessitated the use
of tricks to eliminate the need for sorting males and females.

The first trick used an attached X chromosome. This is an inseparable
pair  of  X  chromosomes  denoted  as  XX^ .  Mating  males  with  females
containing an attached X chromosome, yields the expected four types
of offspring (Fig. 8.22). Both the X’XX^  and YY are lethal and therefore
only mutagenized males or females with the attached X chromosome
result  from  this  mating.  If  the  attached  X  chromosome  contains  a
dominant  temperature-sensitive  lethal  mutation,  the  females  can  be
killed  by  a  brief  temperature  pulse,  leaving  only  the  desired,  mu-
tagenized males as a pure stock. The female stocks required for the first
mating also can be generated by this same technique.

The second problem was the actual selection for the temperature-sen-
sitive  paralytics.  This  was  done  by  introducing  up to 104  flies  into  a
cubical box about two feet on a side. The temperature in the box was

90 °

raised, and the box was given a bang on a table top to make the flies fly
upwards. Any temperature-sensitive paralytics remained at the bottom
of the box. These were trapped by rotating the box so that they were

collected on a ledge. Then the flies were anesthetized by adding carbon
dioxide or ether and those flies which had been able to fly fell to the
bottom of the box where they were killed by the addition of detergent
and acetic acid.

 Like most mutant selection schemes, several additional phenotypes
were found in addition to those sought. One of these was rex for rapid
exhaustion. After running around for few minutes a rex mutant shud-
ders a bit and falls over in a paralysis which lasts a few minutes. It can
then get up and is perfectly normal for about an hour. Another mutant
was the bas for bang-sensitive. The desired mutants fell into three types:
parats for temperature-sensitive paralytic, ststs for stoned, and shits from
the Japanese word for paralyzed. The para mutation lies in the protein
which forms the membrane sodium channel that is essential for nervous
impulse transmission.

Fate Mapping and Study of Tissue-Specific Gene Expression

One obvious way to examine the tissue specificity of gene expression is
to isolate the tissues and assay each for the protein or gene product in
question. A slight modification of this approach is quite reasonable. The
synthesis of messenger from the various tissues of a fly can be measured
approximately by  DNA-RNA hybridization. As we shall see in a later
chapter, DNA from desired genes can be obtained and then used in such
in  situ  hybridization  experiments. Remarkably,  genetics  experiments
called fate mapping can also locate the tissues in which an altered gene
is  expressed.  This  approach  does  not  require  knowledge  of  the  gene
involved  and  therefore  it  is  useful  in  initial  steps  of  studies.  Genetic
engineering has also developed techniques for examination of tissue-
specific gene  expression,  but  those approaches  first require  isolating
DNA or RNA of the gene in question. Fate mapping is useful when the
gene involved is unknown. As an example of localizing the activity of a
gene, imagine a mutant fly that is unable to flap its wings. This could
be because of a defective wing, a defective wing muscle, a defective nerve
to  the  muscle,  or  defective  neurons  in  the  brain.  Fate  mapping  can
determine which tissue is responsible for such altered behavior.

Fate  mapping  relies  on  the  developmental  pathway  of  the  fly.  A
fertilized Drosophila egg contains a single cell whose nucleus undergoes
about nine divisions. These nuclei then migrate to the surface of the egg
to form the blastula stage, and three more divisions occur before cell
walls are laid down. At this stage, different cells on the surface ultimately

Problems  257

become different parts of the adult fly, but cells lying near to each other
frequently develop into adjacent parts on the fly. Therefore, a map can
be drawn on the egg of the parts of the adult fly that each of these cells
will become. If it were possible to associate a particular phenotype in
an adult with a particular location on the egg, then the tissue responsible
for the adult phenotype would be determined. This is possible!

The  association  of  tissues  in  the  mature  fly  with  positions  on  the
blastula utilizes selective chromosome loss during development of the
blastula. Fly development is not greatly altered in a female egg cell if
one of the X chromosomes contains a defect so that it begins the first
nuclear replication a little late. Consequently, this chromosome often is
not segregated into one of the two resultant daughter nuclei resulting
from  the  first  nuclear  division  in  the  egg.  The  final  result  of  this
chromosome loss is that about half of the cells of the blastula will be
diploid XX and the others will be haploid X. Since the spatial orientation
of the first cleavage with respect to the egg shell is not uniform from egg
to egg, and because there is little mixing of the nuclei or cells during
subsequent divisions, different sets of cells will be XX and X in different
blastulas. Suppose that these two types of cells can be distinguished.
This can be done by placing a recessive body color marker gene, for
example  yellow,  on  the  stable  X  chromosome.  Then  cells  of  the  fly
possessing the XX genotype will be black and the X genotype will be
yellow. The adult fly will have a mottled appearance.

The probability that two different body parts possess different colors
will be proportional to the distance that their corresponding ancestor
cells in the blastula state were separated. The greater their separation,
the greater the chances that the line separating the two cell-types will
fall between them. If they are close together, there is little chance they
will be of different cell-type and therefore there is little chance they will
possess different body color.

A collage appears when the body parts of the adult fly are mapped to
the blastula. The map can then be used as follows to locate the tissue in
which a recessive mutation is expressed. If the mutation is located on
the X chromosome which is not lost during the development, then those
tissues which can express the mutant phenotype will be haploid. For
example, if the mutant phenotype always appears in flies with haploid
second left legs and only appears in these flies, then it can be concluded
that the tissue in which the mutation is expressed is the second left leg.
More  generally  however,  the  frequency  of  association  of  the  mutant
phenotype  with  a  number  of  landmarks  gives  the  distance  on  the
blastula between the landmarks and the tissue in question. Transferring
these  distances  to  the  blastula  fate  map  then  reveals  the  tissue  in
question.

stage of meiosis. What is the possible biological value of such a restric-

8.3. How would you select a temperature-sensitive lacI- mutation?

8.5. Show how backcrossing with eukaryotes may be used to deter-
mine the genotypes of heterozygotes. [Hint: Backcrossing means just
about what it sounds like.]

8.6.  Invent  a  scenario  by  which  a  single  nucleotide  change  on  a
chromosome  could  lead  to  inactivation  of  all  the  genes  of  an  entire
chromosome. Note that one of the two X chromosomes in each cell of
females of many organisms is inactivated.

8.7. Invent a scenario by which a mutation could be methylation of
a particular base on DNA. Note that to qualify as a mutation, the effect
must be inheritable. That is, if the base is not methylated, it remains
nonmethylated, but if it somehow should become methylated, then all
descendants will be methylated on the same base.

8.8.  Methylation  of  a  base  of  DNA  in  a  promoter  region  could
inactivate transcription from a gene. Invent genetic data that would lead
to this conclusion. That is, the mutation might be cis or trans dominant,
etc.

8.9. How could it be shown that two genetic markers were on the

same chromosome in a diploid eukaryotic organism?

8.10. Trans dominant negative mutations normally are found in genes
for  oligomeric  proteins  in  which  multiple  subunits  are  required  for
function. How could a mutation in an RNA polymerase nonessential
sigma factor be trans dominant negative?

8.11. No experiment was described in the text that demonstrates that
virtually all recombination events are precise, that is, in register, and do
not delete base pairs from one DNA duplex partner and insert them into
the other. Design one. [Hint: Three nonessential genes A, B, and C are
in an operon and lack introns, and we have A- B+ C+ and A+ B+ C- strains
available.]

8.12.  Consider  a  genetic  crossing  experiment  with  yeast  involving
allelic markers a and A. Why, on first consideration, would you expect
that the number of  cells yielding one a type and three A type spores
would equal the number yielding three a type and one A type? What
mechanism might be responsible for a serious biasing of the numbers
in one direction?

8.13.  Invent  genetic  recombination  data  that  would  lead  to  the
prediction that the genetic markers were arranged in a two-dimensional
array rather than the one-dimensional array of markers that is actually

for the marker being transduced. Why can’t this protocol be used for
the transduction of the streptomycin and rifamycin resistance alleles?
Note that these alleles are recessive to the sensitive alleles.

8.22. In the isolation of leucine-requiring strains with the use of a
penicillin selection, why are the cells grown in leucine-containing me-
dium before the addition of penicillin?

8.23. Nitrosoguanidine mutagenizes the growing points of the bacte-
rial chromosome. Explain how this property could be used to isolate
mutations concentrated in the vicinity of a selectable genetic marker.
For example, if you possessed a Leu- mutation, how could you isolate
many mutations near the leucine genes?

8.24. Nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of E. coli growing rapidly on a
rich yeast extract medium yielded double mutants that were simultane-
ously rifamycin-resistant and arabinose minus. The ara and rif  markers
lie 1/3 of the chromosome apart. Double ara-rif mutants were not seen
if the mutagenesis was performed on cells growing on minimal medium.
Why?

8.25. Expand on the following cryptic statement “Tritium suicide was
used to isolate temperature-sensitive mutations in the protein synthesis
machinery...”

8.26. Physiological and in vitro measurements showed that the RNA
polymerase from streptolydigin-resistant cells was resistant to the drug.
It  was  then  desired  to  map  the  mutation.  Most  likely  this  mutation
would map near the rifamycin resistance mutation. The most straight-
forward way  to  show that the two markers  were  close  to  each other
would have been to start with Stl r Rifs strain and to transduce it to Rif r
from Rifr Stl s and determine if it became Stl s. Presumably this would
show  that  the  Rif  and  Stl  alleles  cotransduce.  Why  is  this  reasoning
risky?

8.27.  What  are  the  expected  effects  on  spontaneous  mutation  fre-
quencies  of  hyper  and  hypo  synthesis  of  the  dam  methylase?  This
protein is thought to mark “old” DNA strands by methylation of adenine
residues in the sequence d(GATC).

8.28. Why are mutant reversion studies more sensitive than forward
mutation  studies  in  the  detection  of  mutagenic  properties  of  com-
pounds? What are the limitations of determining mutagenic specificity
by reversion studies?

8.29. What is a reasonable interpretation of the following? Ultraviolet
light irradiation increases the frequency of mutations in phage only if
both phage and cells are irradiated.

inoculated  into  1,000  tubes  such  that  on  average  each  tube  received

8.39.  In  seeking  mutants  defective  in  the  transmission  of  nerve
impulses,  it was logical to hunt only for temperature-sensitive muta-
tions. Appropriate selections yielded the desired temperature-sensitive
mutations. Such a mutation turned out to be a deletion of a gene for a
protein found in the cell membrane. Why is this a surprise and what
could be an explanation for the temperature-sensitive phenotype?

Genetic Engineering and
Recombinant DNA

9

The terms “genetic engineering” and “recombinant DNA” refer to tech-
niques in which DNA may be cut, rejoined, its sequence determined, or
the sequence of a segment altered to suit an intended use. For example,
a DNA fragment may be isolated from one organism, spliced to other
DNA fragments, and put into a bacterium or another organism. This
process is called cloning because many identical copies can be made of
the original DNA fragment. In another example of genetic engineering,
a stretch of DNA, often an entire gene, may be isolated and its nucleotide
sequence determined, or its nucleotide sequence may be altered by in
vitro mutagenic methods. These and related activities in genetic engi-
neering have two basic objectives: to learn more about the ways nature
works and to make use of this knowledge for practical purposes.

Before 1975 the most detailed studies of biological regulatory proc-
esses  were restricted  to  genes  of  small  phage  or  bacterial  genes  that
could  be  placed  in  the  phage  genome.  Only  by  beginning  with  such
phage  could  DNA  or  regulatory  proteins  be  obtained  in  quantities
adequate  for  biochemical  study.  Also,  only  with  such  phage  could
variant  DNA  sequences  be  easily  generated  for  the  study  of  altered
proteins or DNA. The isolation of specialized transducing phage that
carried the genes of the lac operon were particularly important advances
in this era. These phage provided a 100-fold enrichment of the lac genes
compared to the chromosomal DNA. They also stimulated a wide variety
of important studies that greatly furthered our understanding of gene
regulation  as  well  as  fostered  the  development  of  many  important
genetic engineering techniques. Now genetic engineering permits the
same sorts of studies to be carried out on any gene from virtually any
organism.

265

266  Genetic Engineering and Recombinant DNA

The second major reason for interest in genetic engineering is the
“engineering” it makes possible. A simple application of the technology
is the economical synthesis of proteins difficult or impossible to purify
from their natural sources. These proteins can be antigens for use in
immunization, enzymes for use in chemical processes, or specialized
proteins for therapeutic purposes. Cloned DNA sequences can also be
used for detection of chromosomal defects and in genetic studies. Much
research in genetic engineering has also been directed at plants with the
hope of improving on traditional genetic methods of crop modification.
A  second  objective  is  the  introduction  of  herbicide  resistance  into
desired crops. This would permit spraying against weeds while the crop
is growing instead of only before planting.

Genetic engineering of DNA usually involves the following steps. The
DNA for study should be isolated and freed of interfering contaminants.
It should be possible to cut this DNA reproducibly at specific sites so as
to produce fragments containing genes or parts of genes. Next, it should
be be possible to rejoin the DNA fragments to form hybrid DNA mole-
cules. Vectors must exist to which fragments can be joined and then
introduced into cells by the process called transformation. The vectors
need  two  properties.  First,  they  must  provide  for  autonomous  DNA
replication  of  the  vector  in  the  cells,  and  second,  they  must  permit
selective growth of only those cells that have received the vectors. This
chapter discusses these fundamental steps of genetic engineering as well
as the crucial technique of determining the nucleotide sequence of a
stretch of DNA. The next chapter discusses many of the more specialized
operations that constitute genetic engineering.

The Isolation of DNA

Cellular DNA, chromosomal or nonchromosomal, is the starting point
of many genetic engineering experiments. Such DNA can be extracted
and purified by the traditional techniques of heating the cell extracts in
the presence of detergents and removing proteins by phenol extraction.
If  polysaccharides  or  RNA  contaminate  the  sample,  they  can  be  re-
moved by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in cesium chlo-
ride.

Two  types  of  vectors  are  commonly  used:  plasmids  and  phage.  A
plasmid is a DNA element similar to an episome that replicates inde-
pendently  of  the  chromosome.  Usually  plasmids  are  small,  3,000  to
25,000  base  pairs,  and  circular.  Generally,  lambda  phage  or  closely
related derivatives are used for phage vectors in Escherichia coli, but for
cloning in other bacteria, like Bacillus subtilis, other phage are used. In
some cases a plasmid can be developed that will replicate autonomously
in more than one host organism. These “shuttle” vectors are of special
value in studying genes of eukaryotes; we will consider them later.

Most often, complete purification of plasmid DNA is unnecessary and
useable DNA can be obtained merely by lysing the cells, partial removal
of chromosomal DNA, and the removal of most protein. Intricate DNA
constructions often require highly pure DNA to avoid extraneous nucle-

ases or  inhibition of sensitive  enzymes. The complete purification of
plasmid DNA generally requires several steps. After the cells are opened
with lysozyme which digests the cell wall and detergents are added to
solubilize  membranes  and  to  inactivate  some  proteins,  most  of  the
chromosomal DNA is removed by centrifugation. For many purposes
chromatographic  methods  can  be  used  to  complete  the  purification.
When the highest purity is required, however, the plasmid is purified by
equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. This is done in the presence
of ethidium bromide. Any chromosomal DNA remaining with the plas-
mid will have been fragmented and will be linear, whereas most of the
plasmid DNA will be covalently closed circles. As we saw in Chapter 2,
intercalating ethidium bromide untwists the DNA. For a circular mole-
cule this untwisting generates supercoiling whereas for a linear mole -
cule  the  untwisting  has  no  major  effects.  Therefore  a  linear  DNA
molecule can intercalate more ethidium bromide than a circular mole-
cule. Since ethidium bromide is less dense than DNA, the linear DNA
molecules  with  intercalated  ethidium  bromide  “float”  relative  to  the
circles, and therefore the two species can easily be separated. Following
the centrifugation, the two bands of DNA are observed by shining UV
light  on  the  tube  (Fig.  9.1).  The  natural  fluorescence  of  ethidium
bromide is enhanced 50 times by intercalation into DNA, and the bands
glow a bright cherry red under UV light.

Lambda phage may also be partially purified by rapid techniques that
remove cell debris and most contaminants. A more complete purifica-
tion can be obtained by utilizing their unique density of 1.5 g/cm3, which
is halfway between the density of protein, 1.3, and the density of DNA,
1.7. The phage may be isolated by equilibrium density gradient centrifu-
gation in which the density halfway between the top and bottom of the
centrifuge tube is 1.5. They too may be easily observed in the centrifuge

268  Genetic Engineering and Recombinant DNA

tube.  They  form  a  bluish  band,  which  results  from  the  preferential
scattering of shorter wavelengths of light known as Tyndall effect. This
same phenomenon is the reason the sky is blue and sunsets are red.

The Biology of Restriction Enzymes

In this section we digress into the biology of restriction enzymes and
then return to their use in cutting DNA. A large number of enzymes have
now been found that cut DNA at specific sites. For the most part the
enzymes  come  from  bacteria.  These  enzymes  are  called  restriction
enzymes because in the few cases that have been carefully studied, the
DNA cleaving enzyme is part of the cell’s restriction-modification sys-
tem.

The phenomenon of restriction-modification in bacteria is a small-
scale immune system for protection from infection by foreign DNA. In
contrast to higher organisms in which identification and inactivation of
invading parasites, bacteria, or viruses can be performed extracellularly,
bacteria can protect themselves only after foreign DNA has entered their
cytoplasm. For this protection, many bacteria specifically mark their
own DNA by methylating bases on particular sequences with modifying
enzymes. DNA that is recognized as foreign by its lack of methyl groups
on these same sequences is cleaved by the restriction enzymes and then
degraded by exonucleases to nucleotides. Less than one phage out of
104 wrongly methylated infecting phage is able to grow and lyse an E.
coli protected by some restriction-modification systems. Bacteria fur-
ther protect themselves from plant and animal DNA. Much plant and
animal  DNA  is  methylated  on  the  cytosine  in  CpG  sequences.  Many
strains  of  bacteria  also  contain  enzymes  that  cleave  DNA  when  it  is
methylated on specific positions.

Arber studied restriction of lambda phage in E. coli and found that
E.  coli  strain  C  does  not  contain  a  restriction-modification  system.
Strain B has one restriction-modification system, and yet a different one
recognizes  and  methylates  a  different  nucleotide  sequence  in  strain
K-12. Phage P1 also specifies a restriction-modification system of its
own,  and  this  can  be  superimposed  on  the  restriction-modification
system of a host in which it is a lysogen.

Let the notation λ-C represent lambda phage that has been grown on
E. coli strain C. Infection of strains B, K-12, and C with λ grown on the
various strains yields different efficiencies of plaque formation (Table
9.1). Passage of the phage through a host of one type modifies the DNA
so that it is recognized as “self” and plates at high efficiency if the phage
reinfects that same strain. It is recognized as “foreign” and plates at low
efficiency if the phage infects a strain with a different restriction-modi-
fication system.

Possession of a restriction-modification system introduces complexi-
ties to the process of DNA replication. Imagine that the double-stranded
DNA contains methyl groups on both strands of the DNA at a recogni-
tion sequence. DNA replication creates a new duplex in which one of
the strands in each of the daughter duplexes at first lacks the modifica-
tion. This half-methylated DNA must not be recognized as foreign DNA
and cleaved, but instead must be recognized as “self” and methylated
(Fig. 9.2). Therefore, the restriction-modification system functions like
a microcomputer, recognizing three different states of methylation of
its recognition sequence and taking one of three different actions. If the
sequence is unmethylated, the enzymes cleave. If the DNA is methylated
on one of the two strands, the modification system methylates the other
strand;  if  the  DNA  is  methylated  on  both  strands,  the  enzymes  do
nothing.

A  palindromic  recognition  sequence  streamlines  operation  of  the
restriction-modification system. A palindrome is a sequence that reads
the same forward and backward, such as repaper and radar. Because
DNA  strands  possess a direction, we consider  a DNA sequence to be
palindromic if it is identical when read 5’ to 3’ on the top strand and on
the bottom strand (Fig. 9.3). Palindromes, of course, can be of any size,
but  most  that  are  utilized  as  restriction-modification  recognition  se-
quences are four, five, six, and rarely, eight bases long. By virtue of the
properties of palindromes, both daughter duplexes of replicated palin-
dromic  sequences  are  identical,  and  thus  the  modification  enzyme
needs to recognize and methylate only one type of substrate (Fig. 9.4).
As we already saw in Fig. 9.2, the use of nonpalindromic recognition
sequences would require that the modification enzyme recognize two

different sequences. Presumably dimeric proteins are used to recognize
the palindromic sequences.

Restriction enzymes are divided into three main classes. The enzymes
in class I form a complex consisting of a cleaving subunit, a methylating
subunit, and a sequence recognition subunit. These enzymes cleave at
sites far distant from their recognition sequences and will not be further
discussed here even though they were the first to be discovered. Those
in  class  II  possess  their  sequence  recognition  and  cleaving  activities
together. They cleave in or near their recognition sequence and are of
the most use in genetic engineering. The class III enzymes possess a
cleavage  subunit  associated  with  a  recognition  and  methylation
subunit. These cleave near their recognition site.

A restriction enzyme within a cell is a time bomb because physical-
chemical  principles  limit  the  enzyme’s  specificity  for  binding.  If  a
restriction  enzyme  were  to  bind  to  a  wrong  sequence,  and  a  typical
bacterium  contains  about  4  ×  106  such  sequences,  most  likely  the
sequence would not be methylated and the enzyme could cleave. This
would break the chromosome, and the cell would die. The experimental
observation, however, is that cells containing restriction enzymes do not
noticeably die any faster than cells without restriction enzymes. How,
then, is the extraordinarily high specificity of the restriction enzymes
generated?

Cutting DNA with Restriction Enzymes  271

The  requisite  high  specificity  can  be  obtained  if  cutting  the  DNA
duplex is a two-step process. An enzyme could bind to the recognition
sequence, cleave one strand, wait a while, then cleave the other strand.
This has the effect of utilizing the recognition sequence twice for each
cleavage.  If  the  enzyme  binds  at  a  site  other  than  the  recognition
sequence,  it  rapidly  dissociates  before  cleaving  the  second  strand.
Therefore, restriction enzymes are likely to produce nicks in the DNA
at  sites  other  than  the  recognition  sequence,  but  these  nicks  can  be
repaired with DNA ligase and the cell will not be harmed in the process.
Few restriction enzymes are likely to be found that cleave both strands
of the DNA at an incorrect site in a concerted process.

Cutting DNA with Restriction Enzymes

The restriction enzymes provide a necessary tool for cutting fragments
of DNA out of larger molecules. Their exquisite specificity permits very
great selectivity, and because more than one hundred different restric-
tion  enzymes  are  known  (Fig.  9.5),  their  wide  variety  permits  much
choice in the cleavage sites utilized. Often, fragments may be produced
with end points located within 20 base pairs of any desired location.

One of the more useful properties of restriction enzymes for genetic
engineering is found in the restriction-modification system produced
by the E. coli plasmid R. The corresponding restriction enzyme is called
EcoRI. Instead of cleaving at the center of its palindromic recognition
sequence, this enzyme cleaves off-center and produces four base self-
complementary ends. These “sticky” ends are most useful in recombi-

nant DNA work as they can be reannealed at low temperatures like the
“sticky” ends of phage lambda. This permits efficient joining of DNA
fragments during ligation steps. About half of the restriction enzymes
now known generate overhanging or sticky ends. In some situations, a
DNA fragment can even be arranged to have two different types of sticky

ends so that its insertion into another DNA can be forced to proceed in
one particular orientation.

Isolation of DNA Fragments

Following cleavage of DNA by restriction enzymes or other manipula-
tions to be discussed later, DNA fragments frequently must be isolated.
Fortunately, fractionation according to size is particularly easy because,
as discussed earlier, DNA possesses a constant charge-to-mass ratio and
double-stranded DNA fragments of the same length have the same shape
and  therefore  migrate  during  electrophoresis  at  a  rate  nearly  inde-
pendent of their sequence. Generally, the larger the DNA, the slower it
migrates.

Remarkable resolution is obtainable in electrophoresis. With care,
two fragments whose sizes differ by 0.5% can be separated if they lie
within a range of 2 to 50,000 base pairs. No single electrophoresis run
could possess such high resolution over this entire range. A typical range
for adequate size separation might be 5 to 200 base pairs or 50 to 1,000
base pairs, and so on. The material through which the DNA is electro -
phoresed  must  possess  special  properties.  It  should  be  inexpensive,
easily  used,  uncharged,  and  it  should  form  a  porous  network.  Two
materials meet the requirements: agarose and polyacrylamide.

Following electrophoresis, bands formed by the different-sized frag-
ments may be located by autoradiography if the DNA had been radio-
labeled  before  the  separation.  Usually  32PO4  is  a  convenient  label
because phosphate is  found in  RNA and  DNA,  32P emits particularly
energetic electrons making them easily detectable, and finally 32P has a
short half-life  so that most of the radioactive atoms in a sample will
decay in a reasonable time. The isotope 33P is also used. Its beta decay
is  weaker,  and  it  has  a  half-life  of  90  days.  Often,  sufficient  DNA  is
present  that  it  may  be  detected  directly  by  staining  with  ethidium
bromide. The enhanced fluorescence from ethidium bromide interca-
lated  in  the  DNA  compared  to  its  fluorescence  in  solution  permits
detection of as little as 5 ng of DNA in a band. After the electrophoretic
separation  and  detection  of  the  DNA,  the  desired  fragments  can  be
isolated from the gel.

Joining DNA Fragments

Having discussed how DNA molecules can be cut and purified, it is now
necessary to discuss the joining of DNA molecules. In vivo, the enzyme
DNA ligase repairs nicks in the DNA backbone. This activity may also
be utilized in vitro for the joining of two DNA molecules. Two require-

ments must be met. First, the molecules must be the correct substrates,
that is, they must possess 3’-hydroxyl and 5’-phosphate groups. Second,
the groups on the molecules to be joined must be properly positioned
with  respect  to  one  another.  The  method  for  generating  the  proper
positioning  has  two  variations:  either  to  hybridize  the  fragments  to-
gether via their sticky ends or, if flush-ended fragments are to be joined,
to use such high concentrations of fragments that from time to time
they are spontaneously in the correct positions.

Hybridizing  DNA  fragments  that  possess  self-complementary,  or
sticky ends, generates the required alignment of the DNA molecules.
Many restriction enzymes such as EcoRI produce four-base sticky ends
that can be ligated together after the sticky ends of the pieces to be joined
have hybridized together. Because the sticky ends are usually just four
base  pairs,  lowering  the  temperature  during  ligation  to  about  12°C
facilitates the hybridization-ligation process.

The flush ends of DNA molecules that are generated by some restric-
tion enzymes generate problems. One solution is to convert flush-ended
molecules to sticky-ended molecules by enzyme terminal transferase.
This enzyme adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of DNA. Poly-dA tails can be
put  on  one  fragment  and  poly-dT  tails  can  be  added  to  the  other
fragment (Fig. 9.6). The two fragments can then be hybridized together
by virtue of their self-complementary ends and ligated together. If the
tails are long enough, the complex can be directly introduced into cells,
where  the  gaps  and  nicks  will  be  filled  and  sealed  by  the  cellular
enzymes. More commonly, the polymerase chain reaction as described
in the next chapter would be used to generate any desired ends on the
molecules.

Flush ended molecules can also be joined directly with DNA ligase.
While this method is straightforward, it suffers from two drawbacks: It
requires  high  concentrations  of  DNA  and  ligase  for  the  reaction  to
proceed, and even then the ligation efficiency is low. Also, it is difficult
later to excise the fragment from the vector.

Linkers  can  also  be  used  to  generate  self-complementary  single-
stranded  molecules  (Fig.  9.7).  Linkers  are  short,  flush-ended  DNA
molecules containing the recognition sequence of a restriction enzyme
that  produces  sticky  ends.  The  ligation  of  linkers  to  DNA  fragments

proceeds with reasonably high efficiency because high molar concen-
trations of the linkers may easily be obtained. After the linkers have been
joined to the DNA segment, the mixture is digested with the restriction
enzyme, which cuts the linkers and generates the sticky ends. In this
way a flush-ended DNA molecule is converted to a sticky-ended mole-
cule that may easily be joined to other DNA molecules.

Vectors: Selection and Autonomous DNA Replication

Cloning a piece of DNA requires that it be replicated when it is put back
into cells. Hence the DNA to be cloned must itself be an independent
replicating unit, a replicon, or must be joined to a replicon. Additionally,
since the efficiency of introduction of DNA into cells is well below 100%,
cells that have taken up DNA, and are said to have been transformed,
need to be readily identifiable. In fact, since only about one bacterial
cell out of 105 is transformed, selections must usually be included to
permit only the transformed cells to grow.

Vectors must fulfill the two requirements described above, replica-
tion  in  the  host  cell  and  selection  of  the  cells  having  received  the
transforming DNA. As mentioned earlier, two basic types of vectors are
used: plasmids and phage. Plasmids contain bacterial replicons that can
coexist with the normal cellular DNA and at least one selectable gene.
Usually  it  is  a  gene  conferring  resistance  to  an  antibiotic.  Phage,  of
course, carry genes for replication of their DNA. Since DNA packaged
in a phage coat can enter cells effectively, selectable genes on the phage
usually are unnecessary.

Plasmid Vectors

Most plasmids are small circles that contain the elements necessary for
DNA replication, one or two drug-resistance genes, and a region of DNA
into which foreign DNA may be inserted without damage to essential
plasmid  functions.  One  widely  used  plasmid,  pBR322,  carries  genes
coding  for  resistance  to  tetracycline  and  β-lactamase  (Fig.  9.8).  The
latter confers resistance to penicillin and related analogs by cleaving the
drugs  in  the  lactam  ring,  which  renders  them  biologically  inactive.
Genes  conferring  resistance  to  chloramphenicol,  tetracycline,  and

carried on plasmids.

A useful element to have on plasmids is a DNA replication origin from
a  single-stranded  phage.  When  such  an  origin  is  activated  by  phage
infection, the cell synthesizes sizeable quantities of just one strand of
the  plasmid.  This  facilitates  DNA  sequencing.  In  a  typical  cloning
experiment, a plasmid is cut in a nonessential region with a restriction
enzyme, say EcoRI, foreign EcoRI-cut DNA is added, and the single-
stranded ends are hybridized together and ligated. Only a small fraction
of the plasmids subjected to this treatment will contain inserted DNA.
Most will have recircularized without insertion of foreign DNA. How
can  transformants  whose  plasmids  contain  inserted  DNA  be  distin-
guished  from  plasmids  without  inserted  DNA?  Of  course,  in  some
conditions a genetic selection can be used to enable only transformants
with the desired fragment of inserted DNA to grow. More often this is
not possible and it becomes necessary to identify candidates that con-
tain inserted DNA.

One method for identifying candidates relies on insertional inactiva-
tion of a drug-resistance gene. For example, within the ampicillin-resis-
tance  gene  in  pBR322  exists  the  only  plasmid  cleavage  site  of  the
restriction enzyme PstI. Fortunately PstI cleavage generates sticky ends
and DNA may readily be ligated into this site, whereupon it inactivates
the ampicillin-resistance gene. The tetracycline-resistance gene on the
plasmid  remains  intact  and  can  be  used  for  selection  of  the  cells
transformed with the recombinant plasmid. The resulting colonies can
be tested by spotting onto a pair of plates, one containing ampicillin,
and one not containing ampicillin. Only the ampicillin-sensitive, tetra-
cycline-resistant  transformants  contain  foreign  DNA  in  the  plasmid.
The ampicillin-resistant transformants derive from plasmid molecules
that recircularized without insertion of foreign DNA.

276  Genetic Engineering and Recombinant DNA

Another way to screen for the insertion of foreign DNA utilizes the
β-galactosidase gene. Insertion of foreign DNA within the gene inacti-
vates the enzyme, which can be detected by plating transformed cells
on medium that selects for the presence of the plasmid and also contains
substrates  of β-galactosidase that  produce  colored  dyes  when  hydro-
lyzed. A plasmid would be unwieldy if it contained the complete 3,000
base-pair βgalactosidase gene. Therefore, only a particular N-terminal
portion of the gene is put on the plasmid. The remainder of the enzyme
is encoded by a segment inserted into the chromosome of the host cells.
The  two  portions  of  the  gene  synthesize  domains  that  bind  to  one
another and yield active enzyme. This unusual phenomenon is called
α-complementation. Cloning vectors are designed for the insertion of
foreign DNA into the short, N-terminal part of β-galactosidase.

A  simple  technique  can  greatly  reduce  recircularization  of  vector
molecules that lack inserted foreign DNA. If the vector DNA is treated
with a phosphatase enzyme after cutting with the restriction enzyme,
then recircularization is impossible because the 5’-PO4 ends required by
DNA ligase are absent. Foreign DNA, however, will carry 5’-PO4 ends,

and therefore two of the four breaks flanking a fragment of foreign DNA
can be ligated. This DNA is active in transformation because cells repair
the nick remaining at each end of the inserted fragment.

Plasmids or phage cloning vectors can contain a short stretch of DNA
containing unique cleavage sites for a number of restriction enzymes.
These polylinker regions permit cleavage by two enzymes so that the
resulting  sticky  ends  are  not  self-complementary.  The  vector  cannot
close by itself and be religated; only when a DNA fragment containing
the  necessary  ends  hybridizes  to  the  ends  of  the  plasmid  can  the
structure be ligated into a closed circle, (Fig. 9.9).

Efficient genetic engineering necessitates that plasmid DNA be ob-
tainable in high quantities. Some plasmids maintain only three or four
copies per cell, whereas other plasmids have cellular copy numbers of
25  to  50.  Many  of  the  high-copy-number  plasmids  can  be  further
amplified  because  the  plasmid  continues  to  replicate  after  protein
synthesis  and  cellular  DNA  synthesis  have  ceased  due  to  high  cell
densities or the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. After amplifi-
cation, a cell containing such a relaxed-control plasmid may contain as
many as 3,000 plasmid copies.

Nature did not deliver plasmid vectors ready-made for genetic engi-
neering. The most useful plasmid vectors were themselves constructed

by genetic engineering. The starting materials were R plasmids, which
are plasmids or autonomously replicating DNA elements that carry one
or more drug-resistance genes. The R plasmids are the cause of serious
medical  problems,  for  various  bacteria  can  acquire  R  plasmids  and
thereby  become  resistant  to  the  normal  drugs  used  for  treatment  of
infections  (Table  9.2).  The  conversion  of  an  R  plasmid  into  a  useful
vector requires elimination of extraneous DNA and removal of multiple
restriction  enzyme  cleavage  sites.  In  order  that  foreign  DNA  can  be
cloned into the plasmid, the plasmid should possess only one cleavage
site for at least one restriction enzyme, and this should be in a nones-
sential region.

In the construction of cloning vectors, R plasmids were digested with
various restriction enzymes. The resulting mixture of DNA fragments
was  hybridized  together  via  the  self-complementary  ends  and  then
ligated to produce many  combinations  of scrambled fragments. This
DNA was transformed into cells. Only new plasmids containing at least
the DNA segments necessary for replication and drug resistance sur-
vived  and  yielded  colonies.  The  desirable  plasmids  containing  only
single cleavage sites for some restriction enzymes could be identified by
amplification and purification of the DNA followed by test digestions
with restriction enzymes and electrophoresis to characterize the diges-
tion products. The plasmid pBR322 possesses single restriction enzyme
cleavage sites for more than twenty enzymes. Some of the more com-
monly used are BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, PvuII, and SalI.

A Phage Vector for Bacteria

Phage vectors and phage-derived vectors are useful for three reasons.
Phage can carry larger inserted DNA fragments than plasmids. There-
fore substantially fewer transformed candidates must be examined to
find a desired clone. The efficiency of infecting repackaged phage DNA
into  cells  is  considerably  greater  than  the  efficiency  of  transforming
plasmid DNA into cells. This is an important factor when a rare clone
is being sought. Finally, lambda phage permits a convenient method for
screening to detect the clone carrying the desired gene. Once a desired
segment of DNA has been cloned on a phage, however, the convenience
of manipulating plasmids, due in part to their smaller size, dictates that
the segment be subcloned to a plasmid. 

Lambda  was  an  ideal  choice  for  a  phage  vector  because  it  is  well
understood and easy to work with. Most importantly, the phage contains
a sizable nonessential internal region flanked by EcoRI cleavage sites.
Therefore this nonessential region could be removed and foreign DNA
inserted. Before EcoRI-cleaved lambda DNA could be used for cloning,
it was necessary to eliminate additional cleavage sites that are located
in essential regions of the lambda genome. First, a lambda hybrid phage

was constructed by in vivo genetic recombination. This lacked the three
EcoRI cleavage sites at 0.438, 0.538, and 0.654 in the nonessential region
but retained the two sites in the essential regions. Then the two remain-
ing EcoRI cleavage sites were eliminated by mutation and selection. In
the selection the phage were cycled between hosts lacking and contain-
ing the EcoRI restriction-modification systems. Any phage with cleav-
age  sites  mutated  so  as  to  be  nonrecognizable  by  the  EcoRI  system
would have a greater probability of escaping the restriction enzymes
upon growth in the second host. After 10 to 20 cycles of this selection
scheme, Davis found a phage that had lost one of the two R1 sites, and
after an additional 9 to 10 cycles, he found a mutant that had lost the
other site. This mutant phage was then made into a useful cloning vector
by  recombination  with  wild-type  lambda  to  restore  the  three  EcoRI
cleavage sites located in the central portion of the genome.

The DNA isolated from lambda phage particles is linear and it can be
cleaved by EcoRI to yield the smaller central fragments and the larger
left and right arms. EcoRI-cleaved DNA fragments to be cloned can then
be hybridized together and ligated to purified right and left arms. This
DNA either can be used as it is to transfect cells made competent for its
uptake or it can be packaged in vitro into phage heads and used to infect

Vectors for Higher Cells  279

cells. The efficiency, per DNA molecule, of packaging and infection is
much higher than transfecting with bare DNA. Therefore packaging is
used when the fragment to be cloned is present in only a few copies.

Vectors for Higher Cells

Cloning  DNA  in  higher  cells  poses  the  same  problems  as  cloning  in
bacteria. The vectors must permit simple purification of sizable quan-
tities of DNA, must permit selection of transformed cells, and must have
space for inserted DNA. Shuttle vectors, which have been extensively
used for cloning in yeast, are a neat solution to these requirements. In
addition to containing the normal bacterial cloning-plasmid elements,
they contain a yeast replicon and a genetic marker selectable in yeast
(Fig. 9.10). As a result, large quantities of the vectors can be obtained
by  growth  in  E.  coli  and  then  transformed  into  yeast.  The  ability  to
shuttle  between  bacteria  and  yeast  saves  much  time  and  expense  in
genetic engineering experiments.

Two types of yeast replication origins can be used in yeast shuttle
vectors. One is a yeast chromosomal DNA replication origin, also known
as an ARS element. The other is the origin from the 2 µ circles. These
are  plasmid-like  elements  with  unknown  function  that  are  found  in
yeast. They are somewhat more stable than the ARS vectors. Nutritional
markers such as uracil, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan biosynthesis
have  been  used  as  selectable  genes  in  the  appropriately  auxotrophic
yeast.

Viruses  form  a  basis  for  many  vectors  useful  in  higher  plant  and
animal cells. For example, one of the simplest vectors for mammalian
cells  is  the simian virus  SV4O.  It  permits  many  of  the  same  cloning
operations as phage lambda.

The  terminology  used  with  mammalian  cells  can  be  confusing.
“Transformation” can mean that cells have received a plasmid. It can
also mean that the cells have lost their contact inhibition. In this state
they continue growing past the confluent cell monolayer stage at which

normal mammalian cells cease growth. Transformation to the uninhibi-
ted growing state can result from infection by a tumor-causing virus like
SV4O or it can be a result of mutation of the genome. Although loss of
contact inhibition could be useful in identifying cells that have incorpo-
rated the SV4O DNA or SV4O hybrids, this property is of limited use.
Other  selectable  genetic  markers  suitable  for  mammalian  cells  are
required.

One  useful  gene  for  selections  in  mammalian  cells  has  been  the
thymidine  kinase gene  because TK+ cells can be selected by growing
them in medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymid-
ine. Conversely, TK- cells can be selected by growing them in medium
containing  bromodeoxyuridine  (Fig.  9.11).  Furthermore,  virologists
had previously discovered that the herpes simplex virus codes for its
own  thymidine  kinase.  Therefore  the  viral  genome  can  be  used  as  a
concentrated source of the gene in an expressible form for initial cloning
experiments.

Although the thymidine kinase gene has been useful in selecting cells
that have taken up foreign DNA, a selectable gene that does not require
the prior isolation of a thymidine kinase negative mutant in each cell
line  would  also  be  valuable.  The  E.  coli  enzyme  xanthine-guanine

Putting DNA Back into Cells  281

phosphoribosyl transferase gene appears to meet these requirements.
The  protein  product  of  the  gene  functions  in  mammalian  cells  and
permits selective growth of nonmutant cells that contain the enzyme
(Fig. 9.11). The required growth medium contains xanthine, hypoxan-
thine,  aminopterin,  and  mycophenolic  acid.  Other  dominant  genes
useful for the selection of transformed cells are mutant dihydrofolate
reductase  that  is  resistant  to  methotrexate,  a  potent  inhibitor  of  the
wild-type enzyme, and kanamycin-neomycin phosphotransferase. The
latter  is  an  enzyme  derived  from  a  bacterial  transposon and  confers
resistance to bacteria, yeast, plant, and mammalian cells to a compound
called G418 . Of course, for proper expression in the higher cells the
gene must be connected to an appropriate transcription unit and must
contain the required translation initiation and polyadenylation signals.

Putting DNA Back into Cells

After the DNA sequence to be cloned has been joined to the appropriate
vector, the hybrid must be transformed into cells for biological ampli-
fication. The phenomenon of transformation of pneumococci by DNA
has been known since 1944. Once the desirable genetic properties of E.
coli were realized, it too was tried in transformation experiments. These
were unsuccessful for many years. Unexpectedly, a method for trans-
forming E. coli was discovered. This occurred at a most opportune time,
for  the  developments  in  the enzymology of DNA cutting  and joining
were almost ready to be used in a system of putting the foreign DNA
into cells. Reintroducing a DNA molecule containing a replicon into a
cell permits a biological amplification of that cell to greater than 1012.
In one day, a single molecule can be amplified to quantities sufficient
for physical experiments.

The key to the initial transformation protocols of E. coli was treat-
ment of the cells with calcium or rubidium ions to make them compe-
tent  for  the  uptake  of  plasmid  or  phage  DNA.  The  term  for
transformation  with  phage  DNA  that  then  yields  an  infected  cell  is
transfection,  and  this  term  is  used  for  infection  of  higher  cells  with
nonvirus DNA as well. Yeast may be transfected after a treatment that
includes  incubation  in  the  presence  of  lithium  ions.  Some  types  of
mammalian cells, mouse L cells for example, can be transfected merely
by sprinkling them with a mixture of the DNA and calcium-phosphate
crystals. Here the mechanism of transfection appears to be uptake of
the DNA-calcium-phosphate complex.

Direct manual injection of small volumes of DNA into cells has been
highly useful for the study of cloned DNA fragments because it elimi-
nates the need for a eukaryotic replicon or a selectable gene. Microin-
jection  into the  oocytes  of  the  frog  Xenopus laevis  has yielded much
information, and microinjection into cultured mammalian cells is also
possible. DNA injected into Xenopus cells is transcribed for many hours
and translated into easily detectable amounts of protein. As a result of
these properties, a DNA segment can be cloned onto a plasmid such as
pBR322, manipulated in vitro, and injected into the cells for examina-

282  Genetic Engineering and Recombinant DNA

tion of its new biological properties. Microinjection is also possible into
a  fertilized  mouse  embryo.  The  embryo  can  then  be  reimplanted  to
develop into a mouse. Since the fragments of injected DNA will recom-
bine  into  the  chromosome,  the  mice  are  transfected  by  the  DNA.  In
order  that  all  cells  in  a  transfected  mouse  possess  the  same  genetic
constitution, an injected fragment must recombine into a germ line cell.
Such a mouse is unlikely to be genetically homogeneous because similar
fragments probably have not integrated into somatic cells. The offspring
of such a mouse will be genetically homogeneous, however, and these
can be profitably studied.

Another general method for incorporating DNA into cells is electro-
poration. Cells are subjected to a brief but intense electric field. This
creates  small  holes  in  their  membranes  and  for  a  short  time  DNA
molecules present in the solution can be taken up.

Cloning from RNA

Although DNA can be extracted from cells and used in cloning steps,
sometimes  RNA  is  a better  starting  choice  for cloning. Not  only  will
intervening  sequences  be  missing  from  mRNA,  but  often  mRNA  ex-
tracted  from  certain  tissues  is  greatly  enriched  for  specific  gene  se-
quences.

Extraction of RNA from cells yields a preponderance of ribosomal
RNA. The messenger RNA can easily be separated from this ribosomal
RNA since most messenger RNA from most higher organisms contains
a poly-A tail at the 3’ end. This tail can be used for isolation by passing
a crude fraction of cellular RNA through a cellulose column to which
poly-dT has been linked. At high salt concentrations, the poly-dT which
is  linked  to  the  column  and  the  poly-A  tails  of  messenger  molecules
hybridize and bind the messenger RNAs to the column. The ribosomal
RNA  molecules  flow  through  the  column.  The  messenger  RNAs  are
eluted by lowering the salt concentration so as to weaken the polyA-dT
hybrids. Such a purification step frequently provides a several-hundred-
fold  enrichment  for  messenger  RNA.  The  effort  required  to  clone  a
specific gene is often greatly reduced by using this procedure in con-
junction with choosing a particular tissue at a particular developmental
time.

The  single-stranded  RNA  obtained  by  the  steps  described  above
cannot be cloned directly. Either the RNA can be converted to DNA via
a complementary strand, cDNA, or the RNA can be used to aid identi-
fication of a clone containing the complementary DNA sequence. To
generate a cDNA copy of the poly-A-containing messenger, several steps
are performed (Fig. 9.12). First, a poly-dT primer is hybridized to the
messenger and reverse transcriptase is used to elongate the primer to
yield a DNA copy. This enzyme, which is found within the free virus
particle of some animal viruses, synthesizes DNA using an RNA tem-
plate.  At  this  point  the  sequence  exists  as  an  RNA-DNA  hybrid. It  is
converted to a DNA duplex by the simultaneous incubation with RNAse
H which cuts the RNA strand in an RNA-DNA duplex and DNA polym-

erase pol I which synthesizes DNA using the remaining RNA as primer.
DNA pol I removes the remaining RNA by nick translation. Finally, to
make the ends of the DNA duplex perfectly blunt, T4 DNA polymerase
pol I is added. The resulting double-stranded DNA can then be cloned
by methods already discussed.

Plaque and Colony Hybridization for Clone Identification

Many  techniques  have  been  devised  for  the  detection  of  the  desired
clones. One of the simplest is genetic selection (Fig. 9.13). Most often
this simple avenue is not available, but instead one possesses a related
sequence. Sometimes this related sequence is from a gene analogous to
the desired gene, but from a different organism. Other times, partial
amino acid sequences are known or good guesses can be made as to the
amino acid sequence. From such sequences, the DNA sequences can be

inferred. In such situations the hybridization ability of complementary
DNA  sequences  can  be  used  to  identify  cells  containing  the  desired
clone.

A variety of direct screening techniques exist for detecting a cloned
gene. In these approaches, cloning the foreign DNA into a lambda vector
is convenient because the phage can accommodate inserted fragments
of large size and many lambda phage may be screened on a single petri
plate. The candidate phage collection is called a lambda bank or library.
It is plated out at thousands of plaques per plate. Then a replica copy of
the phage plaques is made by pressing a filter paper onto the plate. After
the paper is removed, it is immersed in alkali. By these steps the DNA
is denatured and fixed onto the paper. Then radioactively labeled RNA
or  DNA,  called  a  probe,  is  hybridized  to  any  complementary  DNA
sequences in plaque images on the paper. The probe contains the known
sequence  derived  from  a  previously  isolated  clone  or  a  sequence  de-
duced from amino acid sequence information. The location of the areas
with bound probe are then determined by autoradiography, and viable
phage containing the desired insert can be isolated from the correspond-
ing position on the original plate. Analogous techniques exist for screen-
ing colonies containing plasmids.

Walking Along a Chromosome to Clone a Gene

Another method of cloning a desired gene is walking. Suppose a ran-
domly  isolated  clone  has  been  shown  to  lie  within  several  hundred
thousand  bases  of  the  DNA  segment  we  wish  to  clone.  Of  course,
demonstrating such a fact is not trivial in itself. In the case of the fruit
fly Drosophila melanogaster, however, the demonstration is straightfor-
ward.

As  explained  earlier, the polytene chromosomes  in cells of several
Drosophila tissues possess characteristic bands that serve as chromoso-

mal landmarks. Therefore the DNA involved in chromosome rearrange-
ments or deletions can readily be observed. Also, highly radioactive DNA
originating from a cloned segment of Drosophila chromosome can be
hybridized in situ to Drosophila polytene chromosomes. The position to
which the fragment hybridizes can then be determined by autoradiog-
raphy. Hence the chromosomal position of a cloned fragment can be
determined. If it lies near a gene of interest, walking may be in order.
A chromosomal walk to clone a specific gene begins with a restriction
map  of  the  cloned  piece  of  DNA.  The  right-  and  left-end  terminal
restriction  fragments  are  used  as  probes  of  a  lambda  bank.  Several
clones are picked that hybridize to the right-hand fragment and not to
the left-hand fragment. Then restriction maps of these clones are made
and again the right- and left-hand fragments are used to find new clones
that hybridize only to the right-hand fragments (Fig. 9.14). The succes-
sive lambda transducing phage that are identified permit walking to the
right, and when a sufficient distance has been covered, in situ hybridi-
zation  permits  determination  of  which  direction  on  the  cloned  DNA
corresponds to moving toward the desired gene.

Arrest of Translation to Assay for DNA of a Gene

In  vitro  translation  of  mRNA  forms  the  basis  of  one  technique  for
identification of clones containing DNA of a particular gene. The tech-
nique requires that the enriched messenger RNA of the gene, such as
the mRNA obtained from an oligo-dT column, be translatable in vitro
to yield a detectable protein product of the desired gene. To perform the
identification, DNA for a candidate clone is denatured and hybridized
to  the  RNA  used  in  the  translation  mixture.  If  the  DNA  contains
sequences  complementary  to  the  mRNA,  the  two  will  hybridize  to-
gether, the messenger will become unavailable for in vitro translation,
and the gene product will not be synthesized (Fig. 9.15). DNA from a
clone not possessing the DNA sequence of the gene will not interfere

with  translation  of  the  messenger.  Hence  DNA  carrying  sequences
complementary  to  the  messenger  can  be  detected  by  hybridization
arrest of translation.

Chemical DNA Sequencing

Two  techniques  were  developed  for  DNA  sequencing:  chemical  and
enzymatic.  Initially  more  DNA  was  sequenced  with  the  chemical
method, but improvements in the enzymatic method now make it the
method of choice for almost all sequencing problems. The application
of the chemical methods, however, are highly useful for biochemical
studies of protein-DNA interactions, and therefore also find significant
use. Both the chemical and the enzymatic sequencing methods utilize
electrophoresis at high temperatures in the presence of urea so as to
denature  the  DNA.  Under these conditions  the  single-stranded mole-
cules migrate at rates almost independent of their sequence and depend-
ent only on their length. In such gels two single-stranded DNA fragments
differing in length by a single base can be resolved from one another if
their lengths are less than 300 to 500 bases.

The basic principle of DNA sequencing by the chemical or enzymatic
method is to generate a set of radioactive DNA fragments covering a
region. The sizes of these fragments indicate the nucleotide sequence of
the region. How is this  possible?  Consider  a  large number  of  single-
stranded molecules (Fig. 9.16). Suppose the 5’ ends of all the molecules
are at the same nucleotide. Suppose also that the 3’ ends of some of the
molecules in the population are at the first A residue after the 5’ end,
some end at the second A residue and so on. That is, the population of
molecules consists of some ending at each of the A’s. If the first few A

population of molecules ending at the former positions of A’s. Their electropho-
resis generates the ladder pattern indicated.

residues were located four, five, and nine nucleotides from the original
5’ end, then fragments would be four, five, and nine nucleotides long.
The sizes of these fragments could be determined by electrophoresis.

In the same way that A-specific ends could be used to determine the
distances of A residues from the end, other base-specific terminations
could be used to determine the distances of the other nucleotides from
the 5’ end.

Practical  considerations  slightly  complicate  the  above  procedure.
First, the amounts of DNA that must be identified are too small to be
detected by staining with ethidium bromide and observing the fluores -
cent DNA bands. Second, the chemical method generates extraneous
fragments  in  addition  to  those  originating  from  the  one  end  under
consideration. These other fragments could interfere with the identifi-
cation of the desired fragments. Both problems are solved by radioac-
tively labeling the DNA at its 5’ end. Autoradiography of the gels then
provides adequate sensitivity, and only the fragments that are radioac-
tive and generate bands on the autoradiographs are precisely those that
include the labeled end.

Obtaining a DNA fragment labeled only at one end is not difficult.
Each strand in a double-stranded segment can be labeled on its 5’ end
with the enzyme T4 phage polynucleotide kinase. Then the two strands
can be separated by denaturation of the DNA and electrophoresis under
partially denaturing conditions. Frequently the two strands migrate at
different rates and can be separated. If so, either can be used in chemical
sequencing. A second way to obtain the DNA fragment with a radioac-
tive label on only one end also begins with end-labeled double-stranded
duplex (Fig. 9.17). This duplex is next cleaved with a restriction enzyme
and if the two fragments are unequal in size, they can be separated by
electrophoresis. Either of the fragments is suitable for DNA sequencing
because only one of the strands in each fragment is then radioactive,
and it is labeled on only one end.

To sequence a stretch of DNA, four populations of radiolabeled DNA
are made, one partially cleaved at each of the four bases. These four
populations are then subjected to electrophoresis in four adjacent lanes

on the denaturing gels. The resulting four ladder patterns permit direct
reading of the sequence of the bases.

In the chemical sequencing method the cleavages at the four bases
are  made  by  subjecting  the  labeled  DNA  to  conditions  that  generate
base-specific cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds. An average of about
one cleavage per several hundred bases is optimal for most sequencing.
Maxam  and  Gilbert  discovered  that  to  generate  the  requisite  base
specificity, the procedure needed to be broken into two parts. The first
part  introduces  a  highly  base-specific  chemical  modification  under
controlled  and  mild  conditions.  Then  harsh  conditions  are  used  to
generate the actual cleavages at all the modified positions.

Dimethylsulfate provides a highly specific methylation of guanines
(Fig. 9.18). The introduction of the methyl group permits subsequent
depurination  followed  by  cleavage  of  the  sugar-phosphate  backbone
with  piperidine.  Slightly  altered  conditions  yield  methylation  by  di-
methyl  sulfate  of  guanines,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  methylation  of
adenines.  Hydrazine  is  used  for  pyrimidine-specific  reactions.  Both
thymine and cytosine react with hydrazine unless high concentrations
of  salt  are  present.  Then  only  cytosine  reacts.  These  reactions  yield
bands  for  G’s,  G’s  +  A’s,  C’s  +  T’s,  and  T’s.  These  are  sufficient  for
sequence determination.

Consider, for example, that the DNA sequence near the 5’ end of the
fragment was 5’-GTCAAG-3’ and the fragment was labeled on its 5’ end.
Then  electrophoresis  of  the  four  reaction  products  yields  a  ladder
pattern from which the sequence may be read by proceeding upward
on the gel from lane to lane (Fig. 9.19). Sequences of up to about 200
bases may be read from a single set of reactions.

Enzymatic DNA Sequencing

Sanger and his colleagues developed an enzymatic method for generat-
ing the  set  of  DNA  fragments necessary for  sequence  determination.
Utilization  of  biological  tricks  now  makes  this  method  particularly
efficient.  When  coupled  with  techniques  to  be  discussed  in  the  next
chapter, thousands of nucleotides per day per person can be sequenced.
The Sanger method relies on the fact that elongation of a DNA strand
by DNA polymerase cannot proceed beyond an incorporated 2’,3’-dide-
oxyribonucleotide. The absence of the 3’-OH on such an incorporated
nucleotide prevents chain extension. A growing chain therefore termi-

nates with the incorporation of a dideoxyribonucleotide. Thus, elonga-
tion reactions are performed in the presence of the four deoxyribonu-
cleotide  triphosphates  plus  sufficient  dideoxyribonucleotide
triphosphate that about one of these nucleotides will be incorporated
per hundred normal nucleotides. The DNA synthesis must be performed
so that each strand initiates from the same nucleotide and from the same
strand. This is accomplished first by using only a single-stranded tem-
plate  and  second  by  hybridizing  an  oligonucleotide  to  the  DNA  to
provide  the  priming  3’-OH  necessary  for  DNA  elongation  by  DNA
polymerases.

In  sequencing,  four  different  elongation  reactions  are  performed,
each  containing  one  of  the  four  dideoxyribonucleotides.  Radioactive
label is introduced to the fragments by the use of either labeled nucleo-
tides  or  labeled  primer.  The  fragments  generated  in  the  elongation
reactions are analyzed after electrophoresis in the same manner as the
fragments generated by chemical cleavage (Fig. 9.20).

Viruses like M13 and f1 that encapsidate  only one strand are one
source of pure single-stranded DNA. Purification of this material from
as  little  as  2  milliliters  of  growth  medium  yields  sufficient  DNA  for
sequencing. M13 has no rigid structural limitations on the length of viral
DNA that can be encapsidated because its DNA is packaged as a rod
during its extrusion through the cell membrane. Therefore large and
small fragments may be inserted into nonessential regions of the virus
genome.  Although  the  viral  form  of  the  virus  is  single-stranded,  the
genetic  engineering  of  cutting  and  ligating  is  done  with  the  double-
stranded intracellular replicative form of the virus DNA. This DNA can
then be transformed into cells just as plasmid DNA is.

Instead of cloning the DNA to be sequenced into the virus, it is simpler
to clone the virus replication origin into a plasmid vector that contains
a nonviral origin as well. Then, cloning and normal genetic engineering
operations can be performed on the plasmid DNA, and when sequencing
is to be done, the cells can be infected with virus. Under the influence
of the virus encoded proteins, the viral replication origin on the plasmid
directs the synthesis of plus strand DNA. This is then isolated and used
in sequencing or purified and used in other operations.

The single-stranded DNA template necessary for Sanger sequencing
may also be obtained by denaturing double-stranded DNA and prevent-
ing  its  rehybridization.  Because  partial  rehybridization,  often  not  in
register, can still occur in many positions, this method works best with
the  use  of  a  DNA  polymerase  capable  of  replicating  through  such

Problems

obstacles. A DNA  polymerase encoded  by phage T7 is helpful in this
regard. Either a chemical modification of  the wild-type enzyme or a
special mutant enzyme makes the T7 DNA polymerase highly processive
and  capable  of  replicating  through  regions  containing  significant
amounts  of  secondary  structure.    The DNA pol I  from  E.  coli  or  the
Klenow fragment of this enzyme are adequate for sequencing from pure
single-stranded DNA.

Needless to say, the vast explosion in the amount of sequenced DNA
has  stimulated  development  of  highly  efficient  methods  for  analysis.
Computer  programs  have  been  written  for  comparing  homology  be-
tween  DNA  sequences,  searching  for  symmetrical  or  repeated  se-
quences,  cataloging  restriction  sites,  writing  down  the  amino  acid
sequences resulting when the DNA is transcribed and translated into
protein, and  performing other time-consuming operations on the se-
quence. The amount of information known about DNA and the ease in
manipulating it has greatly extended our understanding of many bio-
logical processes and is now becoming highly important in industrial
and medical areas as well.

The previous chapter described the fundamentals of genetic engineer-
ing:  cutting,  splicing,  vectors,  cloning,  transformation,  and  DNA  se-
quencing. We will continue here with descriptions of more advanced
manipulations, which, for the most part, are technological aspects of
genetic engineering. These are: additional cloning techniques, the po-
lymerase chain reaction, chromosome mapping, high capacity sequenc-
ing methods, and methods for locating binding sites of proteins on DNA.

Finding Clones from a Known Amino Acid Sequence

Sometimes the protein product of a gene is available in pure form. This
happy  circumstance  can  be  used  to  facilitate  cloning  of  the  gene.
Portions of the protein can be sequenced to determine a potential DNA
sequence  that  could  have  encoded  this  portion  of  the  protein.  An
oligonucleotide with this sequence can then be used to screen a collec-
tion  of  clones,  which  is  called  a  library,  to  detect  those  containing
complementary sequences. The screening is done as described in the
previous chapter. Occasionally, a clone is found in the libraries which
hybridizes to the screening oligonucleotide, but which is not the correct
clone. This results from the chance occurrence of a sequence comple-
mentary to the probing oligonucleotide. These incorrect positives can
be  detected  by  screening  with  a  second  oligonucleotide  that  should
hybridize to a different part of the gene encoding the protein in question.
Only the desired clones should hybridize to both oligonucleotides.

The redundancy in the genetic code prevents simple reverse transla-
tion from an amino acid sequence to a DNA sequence. The difficulty
caused by the redundancy can be partially overcome by using portions

of the protein’s sequence containing amino acids whose codon redun-
dancy  is  low.  This is possible since  both tryptophan and methionine
have  unique  codons.  Consider  the  sequence  met-cys-his-trp-lys-met.
Only  one codon  specifies  an  internal methionine,  while the cysteine,
histidine,  and  lysine are  each  specified by  only  two  possible codons.
Therefore one of only 1 × 2 × 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 = 8 sequences encoded the six
amino acids (Fig. 10.1).

The eight necessary oligonucleotides can be synthesized simultane-
ously by machine by incorporating either of the two ambiguous nucleo-
tides  at  the  necessary  positions.  This  is  accomplished  simply  by
supplying at the correct time a mixture of the two nucleotides to the
synthesis solution.

Purification of the protein necessary for the oligonucleotide probing
approach often is straightforward. Conventional purification need not
be  performed,  however.  Since  all  that  is  needed  for  the  cloning  is
determination of portions of the amino acid sequence, purification and
detection methods need not preserve the protein’s native structure. SDS
gel  electrophoresis,  for  example,  can  be  used  as  a  final  step  in  the
purification of the protein. The protein in the correct band in the gel
can be eluted and a portion of its amino terminal sequence determined
by gas phase and mass spectrometry. As little as 10 -12 moles of protein
are  sufficient  for  determining  enough  of  the  sequence  that  oligonu-
cleotide probes can be designed to identify clones carrying the gene.

Finding Clones Using Antibodies Against a Protein

Cloning a gene becomes easier than described above if sufficient quan-
tities  of  its  gene  product  are  available  to  permit  raising  antibodies
against  the  protein.  DNA  from  the  organism  is  cloned  into  a  vector
designed  to  provide  for  transcription  and  translation  of  the  inserted
DNA. The DNA is best cloned into a site transcribed from a controllable
upstream promoter and also containing an upstream ribosome binding
site  and  protein  translation  initiation  sequence  as well (Fig. 10.2). A
fragment of DNA inserted into the site and containing an open reading
frame is translated if it is fused in frame with the initiation sequence.
As in screening with oligonucleotides, a replica plate is made, cells on
the plate are grown, and the controllable promoter is induced. The cells
are lysed, the proteins are immobilized on a filter, antibody is added,

and then areas with bound antibody are revealed as described below.
The colony from the corresponding position on the replica plate can
then be picked and studied.

Molecules of one particular antibody type bind to just one particular
shape  found  in  some  other  macromolecule.  This  is  defined  as  their
antigen.  Almost  any  protein  can  be  used  as  an  antigen  to  elicit  the
synthesis of antibodies. Thus antibodies provide highly selective agents
for the detection of specific proteins. The antibody selectivity for bind-
ing  to  the  correct  shape  compared  to  binding  to  incorrect  shapes  is
roughly the same as the hybridization selectivity of nucleic acids.

Although radioactive antibody could be used to detect antigen syn-
thesized by candidate clones, it is not efficient, for different antibodies
would then have to be made radioactive for the detection of different
proteins. The A protein from Staphylococcus aureus provides a more
general detection method. This protein binds to a portion of the anti-
body molecule so that one sample of radioactive or enzymatically tagged
Staphylococcus  aureus  A  protein  suffices  for  the  detection  of  many
different  antibody-protein  complexes  (Fig.  10.3).  Another  detection
method  is to use antibodies themselves as labels. The protein on the
filter paper can be incubated with antibodies specific for the protein
that were raised in mice. Then rabbit antibodies that have been raised
against mouse antibodies can be added. These will detect and bind to
most mouse antibodies. The enzyme alkaline phosphatase can be linked

by adding colorless substrate for alkaline phosphatase whose hydrolysis

Southern, Northern, and Western Transfers

Here we will cover in greater detail the topic of Southern transfers that
were mentioned and briefly described in Chapter 2. At the same time,
since  the  concepts  are  almost  the  same,  we  will  also  mention  the
so-called Northern and Western transfers. Southern transfers once were
a  necessary  step  in  chromosome  mapping,  but  their  use  has  been
superseded by techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction. To
review, DNA fragments can be separated according to size by electro-
phoresis through gels, denatured, transferred to a nylon or paper mem-
brane  and  immobilized.  Then  the  membrane  can  be  immersed  in  a

buffer containing a labeled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment and incu-
bated under conditions permitting hybridization between complemen-
tary  nucleic  acid  sequences  (Fig.  10.5).  The  labeled  fragment  will
therefore hybridize to its complementary sequence. The portion of the
membrane  carrying  the  fragment  will  then  become  radioactively  la-
beled, and can be detected by autoradiography. This part of the process
is analogous to plaque and colony screening described in the previous
chapter. This simple technique, named a Southern transfer for Southern
who first devised it, can be used in the analysis of chromosome struc-
ture.

Consider  the  problem  of  learning  whether  the  two  nearest  EcoRI
cleavage sites on either side of a segment of DNA are at the same location
in two nearly homologous chromosomes. If they are not, the situation
is described as a restriction fragment length polymorphism, RFLP, and
the nucleotide differences producing this polymorphism can be used as
a genetic marker. If the restriction fragment containing the sequence is
the same size from both chromosomes, then the nearest EcoRI cleavage
sites are likely to be in the same locations. To search for RFLPs, a DNA
sample containing the two chromosomes is cut with a restriction en-
zyme, separated by electrophoresis, and “probed” with a radioactively
labeled segment of the region (Fig. 10.6). A difference in the sizes of
corresponding fragments indicates the presence of an RFLP.

Northern transfers are the converse of Southern transfers in that it
is  RNA  rather  than  DNA  that  is  separated  by  electrophoresis,  trans-
ferred, and immobilized on membrane to preserve the original pattern.

302  Advanced Genetic Engineering

Membrane with immobilized RNA can then be used in hybridization,
just like paper with immobilized DNA.

What kinds of questions can be answered with immobilized RNA?
One concerns the in vivo state of various RNAs. Transient precursors of
a  mature  RNA  molecule  can  easily  be  detected  because  they  will  be
larger than the mature RNA and will be separated during electrophore-
sis. This permits tracking the maturation process of an RNA molecule.
Not only can the changing sizes of the maturing species be monitored,
but fates of specific regions that are removed can also be followed by
probing with appropriate sequences.

Transfer-like technology can also be used to purify specific RNAs or
DNAs.  Either  single-stranded  RNA  or  single-stranded  DNA  can  be
bound to the paper. Then either RNA or DNA fragments complementary
to  the  immobilized  RNA  or  DNA  can  be  isolated  from  a  mixture  by
hybridization followed by elution. As an application, messenger RNA
eluted from such immobilized DNA can be translated in vitro to provide
a definitive identification of a candidate clone for a specific gene.

Western transfers involve proteins, not nucleic acids. The principle
is the same as for Northern and Southern transfers. A pattern of proteins
that have been separated by electrophoresis is transferred to paper or a
membrane  and  then  specific  proteins  are  visualized.  Some  DNA-  or
RNA-binding proteins can easily be detected after transfer. These pro-
teins partially renature despite being stuck to the paper. Then the paper
with the immobilized proteins is incubated with the radioactive nucleic
acid which binds to the immobilized protein. After washing the paper
to  remove unbound  radioactive  nucleic  acid, autoradiography  of  the
paper reveals the location of the immobilized protein. More often, the
position  of  a  specific  protein  is  revealed  by  antibody  probing  as  de-
scribed in the previous section.

Polymerase Chain Reaction

A method has been devised with such remarkable sensitivity that it can
detect a single molecule of a specific sequence. Furthermore, the single
molecule can be detected in the presence of a 106 or greater excess of
other sequences. This method is called the polymerase chain reaction
or  PCR.  The  polymerase  chain  reaction  is  also  useful  for  studying
specific genes or sequences. For example, it permits the sequencing in
a day or two of a stretch of several hundred nucleotides with the starting
point  being  a  small  sample  of  blood.  No  cloning  is  required  for  the
sequencing. Such sensitivity permits the rapid characterization of the
basis of mutations or of genetic defects. This extraordinary sensitivity
also provides a sensitive test for the presence of a virus like HIV. Again
a sample of blood can be taken and the assay can detect the presence of
one copy of the single virus sequence in 100,000 cells. The polymerase
chain reaction greatly facilitates generation of mutants in vitro and the
synthesis of DNA for physical experiments.

The polymerase chain reaction is a scheme that amplifies the DNA
lying between two sequences which are within several thousand base

pairs of one another. The amplification is accomplished by first dena-
turing the DNA sample, hybridizing two oligonucleotide primers to the
DNA, elongating with DNA polymerase, and repeating this cycle up to
40 times (Fig. 10.7). The two oligonucleotide primers must be comple-
mentary  to  opposite  strands  of  the  DNA.  The  product  of  elongation
primed  by  one  oligonucleotide  plus  the  template  can  then  become
templates  for the  next round of synthesis. As a result, each round of
synthesis doubles the number of product DNA molecules present. The
first  round  of  synthesis  produces  DNA  extending  in  one  direction
beyond each primer, but the DNA made in subsequent cycles from the
first product DNA extends just to the ends of the primers.

Although  DNA  polymerase  I  from  E.  coli  could  be  used  in  the
polymerase chain reaction, its use would be inefficient because each
round of denaturing the double-stranded DNA to form the single strands
necessary as templates would destroy the polymerase. Therefore, these
procedures  use  a  temperature-resistant  polymerase  isolated  from  a
thermophile, Thermus aquaticus. This polymerase withstands the 95°
incubation for denaturing the DNA. Even better, after an incubation at
45° to hybridize primer to the DNA, a temperature at which the polym-
erase is largely inactive, the temperature can be raised to 75° to activate
the  polymerase.  Although  a  little  of  the  primer  dissociates  from  the
template at this temperature, a much greater fraction of any incorrectly
hybridized primer dissociates from incorrect sites. Thus, a very great
specificity is achieved for amplification of just the desired sequence of
DNA.

The polymerase chain reaction can be put to a wide variety of uses.
One simple example is the screening of cloning steps. Ordinarily, one
must  screen  transformants  after  the  simple  step  of  inserting  a  DNA
fragment into a plasmid. Typically 90% of the transformants contain
the fragment, but since the frequency is not 100%, one must verify that

the clone selected for further work is suitable. Previously such verifica-
tion required growth of cultures from a collection of candidates, puri-
fication of the plasmids from each, and screening of each by restriction
enzyme  digestion  followed  by  gel  electrophoresis  to  check  for  the
restriction fragment with properly altered size. PCR permits the same
test in much less time. Transformant colonies are picked directly into
tubes used for PCR. The first heat step lyses the cells. Primers are used
that flank the site into which the fragment was to be cloned. The product
of the amplification is run on a gel. If the fragment had been cloned
between  the  sites,  the  amplified  piece  will  have  one  size,  but  if  the
fragment had not been cloned, the fragment would be much smaller
(Fig. 10.8).

DNA  for  footprinting  or  sequencing  can  be  made  directly  from
genomic DNA with the polymerase chain reaction. By labeling one of
the oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR reaction, the DNA that is
synthesized is already radioactive and ready for use. Such a technique
eliminates the need for cloning the DNA from mutants. It also stream-
lines the screening of genetic diseases or of mutants isolated in the lab.
Instead of cloning the DNA to determine the defect in a gene, the DNA
from  the  organism  or  cells  can  be  directly  amplified  and  the  defect
determined by sequencing. PCR also greatly facilitates genetic construc-
tions. For example, suppose a portion of a gene is to be cloned in an
expression  vector.  The  oligonucleotide  primers  can  include  not  only
regions homologous to the DNA to be cloned, but also additional regions
necessary  for  cloning  and  expression  like  restriction  sites,  ribosome
binding sites, and translation termination signals (Fig. 10.9). In the first
round of amplification, the regions of homology between the primers
and  the  template  DNA  hybridize.  In  subsequent  rounds,  the  entire

sequence plus the desired flanking sequences.

Isolation of Rare Sequences Utilizing PCR

The power of PCR can be used to simplify the cloning of genes and to
isolate  special  rare  DNA  or  RNA  molecules  out  of  large  populations
containing many different sequences. First let us consider the cloning
of a gene if a tiny portion of its protein product can be isolated. The
amino acid sequence of a stretch of the protein must be determined.
This  is  used  to  design oligonucleotides  that  hybridize to the top and
bottom strands of the ends of the region encoding the peptide and can
be used in PCR to amplify the region from cDNA template. Of course,
redundancy in the genetic code necessitates that each oligonucleotide
be  a  mixture  as  discussed  earlier  in  the  chapter.  For  use  with  PCR,
however, there is less need to minimize the degeneracy. Even though
the proper DNA sequence is represented by only a tiny fraction of each
oligonucleotide mixture, just these oligonucleotides will be functional
in PCR amplification of the desired region of DNA. The other oligonu-
cleotides may hybridize to the template cDNA, but they are unlikely to
give rise to any PCR products, and it is even less likely that such products
would be of the same size as the desired PCR product. 

The PCR amplified product of a portion of the gene can then be used
to probe a cDNA library contained on plasmid or phage clones. This will
reveal the clones likely to contain an intact version of the desired gene.
PCR is also useful for the isolation of very rare sequences present in
complex mixtures of sequences. During the chemical synthesis of DNA,
the use of mixtures of nucleotide precursors for some synthesis cycles
enables  large  random  populations  to  be  synthesized.  Consider  the
determination  of  the  optimum  binding  sequence  of  a  DNA-binding
protein. One strand of DNA can be synthesized with unique sequences
at  each  end  and  containing  a  totally  random  interior  region.  First,
strands complementary to the chemically synthesized molecules must
be constructed. Due to the random sequences involved, the complemen-

tary strands cannot be synthesized chemically. They are made enzymati-
cally be hybridizing a DNA primer to the unique sequence at one end of
the chemically synthesized strand. Next, DNA pol I is used to elongate
and complete the synthesis of an exact complement (Fig. 10.10). Then,
the  small  population  of  DNA  molecules  with  sequences  capable  of
binding the protein are isolated, for example, by electrophoretic sepa-
ration of protein-DNA complexes from DNA incapable of binding the
protein. This tiny amount of DNA is amplified by PCR using primers
complementary to the unique sequences at the ends. After amplifica-
tion, the selection and amplification steps can be repeated, and finally
the DNA can be cloned and sequenced.

Simple variations on the basic idea described above can be developed
for the isolation of RNA capable of binding a protein or specific support
on an exchange column. It is also possible to devise methods for the
selection of DNA or RNA molecules that possess hydrolytic activities.
Mutagenic steps can be introduced in the PCR amplification steps so
that variants of the selected molecules can be created. In this way, true
in vitro evolution experiments can be done. Living cells are not required.

Physical and Genetic Maps of Chromosomes 

A  genetic  map  contains  the  order  and  approximate  recombinational
distance between genetic markers whereas a physical map contains the
order and physical locations of physical features of a chromosome. Most
often the features used in a physical map are short segments of known
sequence. Once a physical map exists, genetic markers can be placed on

Chromosome Mapping  307

it. Then the mapping and cloning of the genes responsible for genetic
diseases is greatly simplified. For example, the nearest physical marker
can  be  chosen  as  a  starting  point  and  with  chromosome  walking  as
described in the previous chapter you can clone the gene.

Two major objectives of genetic engineering are acquiring the ability
to detect genetic diseases and learning their biochemical basis. Both of
these objectives are greatly aided by cloning of the mutant gene. Once
the clone is available, direct screening for the mutant DNA is possible
and the study of the wild type and mutant gene product becomes easier.
Cloning the DNA involved with most genetic diseases is difficult, how-
ever. Frequently all that is known is an approximate map location of the
defect. The usual helpful tools such as an altered enzyme, protein, or
nucleic acid are missing. Here we will see how this difficulty can be
circumvented.

Suppose there existed a highly detailed genetic map of the human
genome. Then any new marker or genetic defect could be located by
measuring its recombinational distance from the known and mapped
markers. Of course, this step might require collecting data from several
generations of genetic carriers. Once the map location was obtained, we
could use this information in genetic counseling. Furthermore, with the
integration of a physical map and a genetic map, we would also know
the physical location of the genetic marker. Therefore, we could begin
from the nearest physical marker and perform a chromosomal walk to
clone the gene responsible for the defect.

Typically we think of the genes that code for blood type, hair color,
or those genes encoding known enzymes or proteins as constituting the
genetic map. While these genes can be useful, too few of them are known
to  permit  precise  mapping.  Furthermore,  identifying  many  of  these
markers requires the intact individual. Often this is inconvenient. In-
stead, we need a new kind of genetic marker, one that exists in high
numbers and which is easy to score in the DNA obtained from a small
number of cells.

What constitutes a suitable genetic marker? A genetic marker must
be easily detected in a small sample of cells or DNA and it must exist in
the population in two or more states. If the population were homozy-
gous, then there would be no useful markers since both parents and all
offspring would be genetically identical. No mapping genetic could be
done. The existence of markers means that some individuals possess
one  allele  or  sequence  at  a  position,  and  other  individuals  possess  a
different  allele  or  sequence.  If  there  are  hundreds  or  thousands  of
markers at which different individuals in the population are likely to be
different, then it is feasible to try to map a genetic defect with respect
to these known markers.

Chromosome Mapping

It  is  simplest  first  to  determine  a  large-scale  and  coarse  map  of  a
chromosome and then to build upon the initial map to increase resolu-
tion. Construction of a low-resolution physical map can begin with a

308  Advanced Genetic Engineering

STS

library  of  overlapping  clones.  Mapping  would  then  be  picking  and
ordering  a  subset  of  these  which  spans  an  entire  chromosome.  The
larger the clones, the fewer which need to be ordered, and the easier it
is  to  construct  of  the  initial  map.  The  yeast  artificial  chromosome
vectors,  YAC  vectors,  are  useful  for  chromosome  mapping  projects
because they can accommodate very large fragments of foreign DNA,
up to 106 base pairs. These contain autonomous replicating sequences,
ARS, as origins and telomeres for the ends.

Let us first consider the physical markers which are necessary for the
construction of a physical map. Unique sequences of DNA one or two
hundred base pairs long can provide a good starting point for construc-
tion of a physical map. Such sequences can be obtained by sequencing
random clones made from the chromosome to be mapped. The unique-
ness of a sequence can be checked by hybridization. From such a unique
sequence, two 20 to 30 base portions can be chosen for oligonucleotide
primers that will permit PCR amplification of the sequence lying be-
tween. This amplification will occur only if the template DNA present
in  the  PCR  reaction  contains  the  unique  sequence.  Such  a  unique

PCR

Sequence-tagged site

sequence is called a sequence-tagged site, or STS. A sample of DNA is
tested for the presence of an STS by PCR amplification using the two
oligonucleotides followed by gel electrophoresis to assay for the ampli-
fication of the proper-sized DNA fragment.

When the number of sequence-tagged sites exceeds the number of
clones necessary to span the chromosome by a factor of four or five or
more, the sites can be used just like restriction enzyme cleavage sites
are used in a chromosomal walk. That is, each YAC vector is assayed
for the presence of each STS. If an STS site is present in two vectors,
then the chromosome fragment carried by each contains this region in
common  (Fig.  10.11).  Merely  from  this  data,  the  STS  sites  can  be

Chromosome Mapping  309

ordered and an overlapping physical map of the chromosome can be
constructed. Of course, for even the smallest human chromosome, tens
of thousands of YAC vectors must be present in the library, and hun-
dreds of STS sites are needed. Therefore, very many PCR amplification
reactions will be required for the ordering.

Mutations, insertions, and deletions have also been used in chromo-
some mapping. Originally, restriction fragment length polymorphisms,
RFLPs  were  used  as  genetic  and  physical  markers  for  chromosome
mapping. Over the majority of  the genome, sequence differences be-
tween  individuals  exist  at  a  frequency  of  about  10-4.  If  one  of  these
differences occurs in the cleavage site for a restriction enzyme an RFLP
will exist there. Another source of an RFLP is an insertion or deletion
or a difference in the number of repeats of a short sequence contained
between the two restriction enzyme cleavage sites.

Restriction  fragment length  polymorphisms can be detected using
Southern transfers as described in an earlier section. If individuals differ
in one out of 104 base pairs, then the chances that a particular restriction
enzyme cleavage site will be present in one chromosome but be missing
in  the  homologous  chromosome  would  be  about  0.001.  There  is  a
reasonably high probability that either an insertion exists between two
restriction  enzyme  cleavage  sites  or  that  two  individuals  differ  at  a
particular point in the number of times that a short sequence is repeated
there.  One  out  of  a  hundred  to  one  out  of  a  thousand  restriction
fragments it is likely to be polymorphic between some individuals in the
population. Therefore, considerable work could be required to find DNA
sequences useful for RFLP mapping. One method for RFLP detection
is  to  clone  random segments of human DNA and  use them to probe
Southern transfers of various enzyme digests from a moderate number
of people. The occasional clone which reveals a polymorphism is then
mapped to a specific chromosome and finally mapped at higher resolu-
tion by comparing its segregation pattern to the pattern of other markers
known to lie on the same chromosome.

A  more  efficient  method  of  finding  and  mapping  genetic  markers
utilizes the polymerase chain reaction. Instead of using Southern trans-
fers to detect an RFLP, PCR is used to amplify a segment of DNA that
contains variable numbers of inserts. Different individuals in the popu-

lation often possess different numbers of inserts at the same point (Fig.
10.12). The size of a fragment synthesized by PCR identifies the size of
the  insert.  It  is  much  easier  to  perform  a  PCR  amplification  and
determine  the  size  of  the  product  than  it  is  to  perform  a  Southern
transfer. Therefore, most chromosome mapping will shift to the use of
PCR. By the approaches described above, hundreds of RFLP or PCR-
based markers have already been mapped to the human genome and
DNA  defects  of  a  significant  number  of  genetic  diseases  have  been
mapped with respect to the markers.

DNA Fingerprinting—Forensics

At  the  other  extreme  from  genome  markers  like  restriction  enzyme
length  polymorphisms  would  be  genetic  loci  at  which  nearly  every
individual is unique and different. In such a case a child would inherit
one or the other of the allelic states of each marker from each parent.
Another child of the same parents would again inherit markers from the
parents, but it would be a different set. Thus, some markers in the two
children would be the same and others would be different. On the other
hand, two unrelated individuals would possess virtually no markers in
common.

After the above abstract description, let us consider a real situation.
Scattered through the human genome are stretches containing repeats
of a 32 base pair sequence. In any one of the stretches the sequence is
repeated over and over again, sometimes reaching a length of thousands
of nucleotides. Different individuals possess these repeated sequences,
called minisatellites, in the same locations, but the number of repeats
of the short sequence varies from person to person.

Consider  the  consequences  of  digesting  the  genomic  DNA  with  a
restriction enzyme that cleaves frequently, but lacks a cleavage site in
the repeated sequence. After such cleavage the DNA is separated accord-

ing to size by electrophoresis. The fragments containing the repeated
sequence are then identified by Southern transfer using a radioactive
probe containing the 32 base repeated sequence.

For a typical individual, the cleaving and probing procedure resolves
about  20 fragments of  size  greater than several thousand base pairs.
Since each individual possesses different numbers of the 32 base repeats
in these long stretches, each possesses a different collection of sizes for
these large fragments. In short, the sizes of these fragments are DNA
inheritable “fingerprints” unique to each chromosome of the individual.
These DNA fingerprints are of forensic and legal value since they provide
a unique linking of an individual to the DNA that can be extracted from

Megabase Sequencing  311

a small amount of skin, blood, or semen, or for the determination of
familial relationships.

Megabase Sequencing

In addition to mapping, sequencing often provides fundamental infor-
mation for further studies on a gene or gene system. The sequencing
techniques described in the previous chapter are adequate for sequenc-
ing  a  few  genes,  but  one  area  of  great  interest,  the  immune  system,
possesses  hundreds  of genes,  many  of unknown  function.  Here  hun-
dreds of thousands of nucleotides must be sequenced. Serious effort is
now also going into the early steps of determining the sequence of the
entire human genome. Large sequencing projects such as these require
better methods, and  several  have been developed. The one described
below eliminates the use of radioisotopes and automates the detection
of the bands on gels.

A number of steps in the standard DNA sequencing procedure seri-
ously limit data acquisition. These are obtaining the plasmids necessary
for  sequencing  the  desired  region,  pouring  the  gels,  exposing  and
developing the autoradiograph films, and reading the information from
the films. Several of these steps can be streamlined or eliminated.

Imagine the savings in the Sanger sequencing technique if each of
the four dideoxynucleotides could be tagged with a unique label. Then,
instead of labeling the primer or the first nucleotides synthesized, the
chain terminating nucleotide would possess the label. If this were done
and each of the four labels were distinguishable, the four dideoxynu-
cleotides could be combined in the same synthesis tube and the complex
mixture of the four families of oligonucleotides could be subjected to
electrophoresis in the same lane of the gel. Following electrophoresis,
the  four  families  of  oligonucleotides  could  be  distinguished  and  the
entire sequence read just as though each one occupied a unique lane on
the gel.

Instead of using radioactive label, a fluorescent label is used. In order
that this approach work well, the fluorescent adduct on the dideoxynu-
cleotide  must  not  interfere  with  the  nucleotide’s  incorporation  into
DNA. Furthermore, each of the four nucleotides must be modified with
a different adduct, one that fluoresces at a different wavelength from
the others. In addition, it is useful if the excitation spectrum of the four
fluorescent  molecules  substantially  overlap  so  that  only  one  exciting
wavelength is required (Fig. 10.13).

Although the entire gel could be illuminated following electrophore-
sis, it is easier to monitor the passage during electrophoresis of one band
after another past a point near the bottom of the gel. By measuring the
color of the fluorescence passing a point near the bottom of the gel, the
nucleotide  terminating  this  particular  size  of  oligonucleotide  can  be
determined (Fig. 10.14). One after another, from one nucleotide to the
next, the oligonucleotides pass the illumination point and the color of
their  fluorescence  is  determined,  yielding  the  sequence  of  the  DNA.
Multiple lanes can be monitored simultaneously so that the sequence
can be determined semiautomatically of many different samples simul-
taneously. Each lane of such a gel can provide the sequence of about
400 nucleotides of DNA.

The sensitivity of such a DNA sequencing approach is less than the
radioactive techniques, but it is still sufficiently high that small DNA
samples  can  be  successfully  used.  A  more  serious  problem  than  the
sensitivity  is  the  generation  of  useful  samples  to  be  sequenced.  One
approach is to generate many random clones from the desired DNA in
a vector suitable for Sanger sequencing, to sequence at least the 300
nucleotides  nearest  to  the  vector  DNA,  and  then  to  assemble  the  se-
quence  of  the  region  by  virtue  of  the  overlaps  between  various  se-
quences.  This  shotgun  approach  yields  the  desired  sequences  if
sufficient  clones  are  available  and  sufficient  time  and  effort  are  ex-
pended.  In  the  sequencing  of  any  sizeable  amount  of  DNA,  a  pure
shotgun approach is not efficient, and great effort is required to close
the “statistical” gaps. When a few gaps remain, it may be easier to close
them  by  chromosome  walking  than  by  sequencing  more  and  more

Another method of generating the necessary clones for sequencing a
large region is to use a nested set of overlapping deletions. By sequenc-
ing from a site within the vector sequences with the use of an oligonu -
cleotide that hybridizes to the vector, the first 400 or so nucleotides of
each of the clones can be determined. The resulting sequences can easily
be assembled to yield the sequence of the entire region.

Cloned DNA

Such a set of clones can be generated by opening a plasmid containing
the cloned DNA, digesting with an exonuclease for various lengths of
time,  and  recloning  so  that  increasing  amounts  of  the  foreign  DNA
inserted in the plasmid are deleted (Fig. 10.15).

Footprinting, Premodification and Missing Contact Probing

Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying the regulation
of gene expression is a central problem in biochemistry-biology. One of
the first steps in the study of a protein that binds to DNA is to determine
where  it  binds.  The  use  of  DNAse  footprinting  in  conjunction  with
Southern transfers to determine the locations of histone binding was
briefly described in Chapter 2. Galas and Schmitz developed the elegant
method of footprinting to solve the problem of determining the location

at which a protein binds to DNA. As described earlier, their method is
based on the principles behind DNA sequencing. Although it was de-
vised for mapping DNAse-sensitive sites, it can be used with any reagent
that cleaves the DNA or modifies it so that later the DNA can be cleaved.
The basic idea can also be used in two modes, a protection mode in
which  the  bound  protein  protects  the  DNA  from  the  reagent,  and  a
prebinding interference mode in which the DNA is modified first and
then the positions of modification which prevent protein binding are
determined.

In the simplest form of footprinting the DNA fragment to be investi-
gated must first be labeled on just one end of one strand. This can be
done with polynucleotide kinase, with terminal transferase, which adds
nucleotides to the 3’-OH end of DNA, with DNA pol I, which fills out
sticky ends left by many restriction enzymes, or with PCR by amplifying
a region containing the binding site and the use of one radioactively-la-
beled oligonucleotide primer.

After  the  binding  of  a  protein  to  the  DNA,  the  complex  is  briefly
treated with DNAse. The duration of this treatment is adjusted so that
about  one random  strand  scission  occurs  per DNA  molecule. Conse-
quently,  the  population  of  molecules  will  contain  examples  of  phos-
phodiester bond breakage at all positions except those covered by the
protein  (Fig.  10.16).  Then  the  DNA  is  denatured  and  subjected  to
electrophoresis on a sequencing gel. This separates the population of
molecules according to  size,  and the amount of  DNA  in any  band  is
proportional to the amount of cleavage that occurred at the correspond-

ing position in the DNA. No cleavages occur in the positions protected
by the presence of the bound protein.

The footprinting experiments can also be performed with the protein
protecting  the  DNA  binding  site  from  chemical  attack  rather  than
enzymatic attack. Dimethylsulfate can methylate guanine residues ex-
cept some of those protected by the protein. After the methylation, the
DNA  can  be  cleaved  at  each  of  the  methylated  guanines,  and  the
denatured, labeled fragments can be subjected to electrophoresis on a
sequencing gel. Both DNAse I and dimethylsulfate are imperfect in that
their reaction with unprotected DNA is somewhat base-specific. Conse-
quently, both of these techniques must be performed with the control
of  labeled  DNA  free  of  the  binding  protein.  The  differences  in  the
intensities of the bands between the DNA and protein plus DNA samples
then identify the phosphodiester bonds protected from cleavage by the
protein. The hydroxyl radical will attack and cleave the phosphodiester
backbone independent of sequence. Thus, it is particularly useful for
footprinting experiments.

The premodification interference mode for performing footprinting
types of experiments is to modify or nick the DNA before addition of the
protein whose binding site is to be mapped (Fig. 10.17). Then the protein
is added. Those DNA molecules still capable of binding the protein are
separated from the DNA molecules that have been modified in regions
essential  for  binding of the  protein, and  as a result, do not  bind  the
protein. These two populations of DNA molecules are separated from
one another by the mobility retardation  assay, in which DNA with a
bound protein migrates more slowly than DNA without a bound protein.
If necessary, the two populations are cleaved at the positions of modified

bases  and  the  fragments  are  separated  on  DNA  sequencing  gels  as
described before.

The basic ideas of footprinting and premodification probing can even
be adapted to reveal specific amino acid residue-DNA base interactions
in  the  binding  of  a  protein  to  DNA.  The  approach  is  similar  to  the
premodification  method  just  described.  The  labeled  DNA  is  treated
chemically so that each molecule, on average, has one base removed
from a random position. This can be either a hydroxyl radical treatment
or  one  of  the  base-specific  reactions  used  in  Maxam-Gilbert  DNA
sequencing.  Then  the  entire  population  of  molecules  is  permitted  to
bind to the protein. There is no effect on the binding if a base is missing
from  a  position  not  contacted  by  the  protein.  If,  however,  a  base  is
missing from a position the protein contacts, the protein will bind less
tightly. Thus, if the protein and treated DNA are mixed and then diluted
so that no further binding can occur, the protein will dissociate first, if
it ever binds at all, from those DNA molecules that are missing bases
that are contacted by the protein. The population of free DNA molecules
becomes enriched with such DNA molecules. Similarly, the population
of DNA molecules with bound protein becomes enriched with molecules
that  are  missing  only  those  bases  not  involved  with  contacts  to  the
protein. The two DNA populations can be separated from one another
with the DNA band shift assay. If necessary, the molecules are chemi-
cally cleaved at the positions of missing bases, and the positions of the
cleavages are displayed after electrophoresis on DNA sequencing gels.
To  demonstrate  a  specific  residue-base  interaction,  the  residue  is
modified by site-specific mutagenesis or PCR to an alanine. Because
alanine is smaller than most other amino acids, most likely it will be
unable to make the contact made by the amino acid it replaced (Fig.
10.18). Thus, in performing the missing contact experiment, a new base
will be in the collection of bases not contacted. This is the base contacted
by the amino acid at the position of the new alanine. Of course, in the
execution of the experiment, allowance must be made for the fact that
dissociation of the protein from the DNA is faster because of the missing
contact.  Either  a  shorter  time  is  allowed  for  dissociation  or  buffer
conditions are altered to increase the affinity of binding.

Antisense RNA: Selective Gene Inactivation

Learning the in vivo functions of many gene products is not simple. We
do  learn  the  consequences  of  defects  in  humans  of  those  particular
proteins that have been associated with genetic diseases. As seen earlier,
however, finding such proteins often involves huge amounts of work,
and therefore relatively few are known. Not even this tool is available
for most gene products or gene products in most organisms. Is there a
general method for determining the function of genes in other organ-
isms? Of course in bacteria, yeast, and sometimes in the fruit fly, specific
genes can be intentionally inactivated, but rarely do satisfactory meth-
ods exist for inactivating genes in other organisms.

Antisense messenger RNA is one method for inactivating gene prod-
ucts. Massive synthesis of an RNA complementary to a messenger RNA
will prevent translation of the messenger by hybridizing to it before it
is translated (Fig. 10.19). Thus the synthesis of the antimessage inacti-
vates the message. First, the gene must be cloned and then the gene or
a  portion  of  it  is  fused  to  a  promoter  so  that  its  induction  leads  to
synthesis of antimessenger. This antigene construct must then be intro-
duced  into  the  appropriate  cells.  Genes  thought  to  be  important  in
development  have  been  examined  with  antisense  messenger,  and  in
some cases have been found to have drastic effects on the development
of the organism.

Hypersynthesis of Proteins

Two reasons for cloning genes are to mutate the gene to alter the product
for in vivo or in vitro studies and to increase the synthesis of a gene
product  either  in  its  native  organism  or  in  bacteria.  Hypersynthesis
almost always seems necessary, for the more interesting the protein, the
lower the levels at which it seems to be synthesized.

The  most  important  factors  limiting  levels  of  protein  synthesis  in
bacteria,  which  is  where  most  cloned  genes  are  expressed,  are  the
strength  of  the  promoter  and  the  ribosome  binding  site.  Secondary
factors that can affect translation are the potential for folding of the
mRNA and codon usage. One of the most important and most vexing

318  Advanced Genetic Engineering

problems  in  the  hypersynthesis  of  proteins  is  proper  folding.  A  high
synthesis rate of many proteins does not yield a high concentration of
the protein in the cytoplasm of the cells. Instead the protein is found in
the form of granules or pellets often approaching the size of a bacterial
cell. These are called inclusion bodies.

Inclusion  bodies  form  when  the  protein  synthesis  rate  so  greatly
exceeds its folding rate that an excess of hydrophobic areas are exposed.
These bind and aggregate to form amorphous precipitates of inactive,
and often insoluble protein. Several steps sometimes reduce the prob-
lem. Cells can be grown at low temperatures so that the rate of protein
synthesis is greatly slowed whereas the rate of folding is only slightly
depressed.  The  inclusion  bodies  can  easily  be  purified  by  low  speed
centrifugation.  They often contain essentially pure protein and occa-
sionally the protein can be dissolved in urea or guanidine hydrochloride
and renatured to yield active protein by slow removal of these denatur-
ing agents. Sometimes the presence of chaperonin proteins during the
synthesis or renaturation process increases yields of soluble protein.

Altering Cloned DNA by in vitro Mutagenesis

Understanding DNA-related biological mechanisms requires more than
characterizing the DNA and associated proteins. It often requires altera-
tion of the components. Not only does variation of the relevant parame-
ters reveal more about the working mechanism, but the ability to test
variants permits definitive proof of theories. Mutants have been used in
molecular  biology  almost  from  its  origins,  first  in  the  elucidation  of
biochemical pathways and now prominently in structural studies of the
mechanisms by which proteins function as enzymes or recognize and
bind to specific nucleotide sequences on DNA.

The efficient isolation of mutations has always posed a problem in
molecular biology. Suppose mutations are desired in a particular gene
or DNA sequence. If the entire organism must be mutagenized, then to
obtain a reasonable number of alterations in the desired target, many
more alterations will inevitably occur elsewhere on the chromosome.
Often these other mutations will be lethal, so the necessary alterations
in the target cannot easily be found. A method is needed for directing
mutations just to the target gene. In vitro mutagenesis of cloned DNA
fragments  is  a  solution  to  the  problem.  Only  the  DNA  of  the  target
sequence is mutagenized. Just this sequence is then put back into cells.
Often random mutations need to be directed to small areas of genes
or  to  specific  nucleotides,  or  specific  changes  are  desired  in  specific

nucleotides. Some changes are easy to make. For example, insertions
and  deletions  can  be  generated  at  the  cleavage  site  of  a  restriction
enzyme. A four-base insertion can be generated at the cleavage site of
BamHI by filling in the four-base single-stranded ends with DNA pol I
and ligating the flush ends together.

Similarly,  a  four-base  deletion  can  be  generated  by  digesting  the
single-stranded ends with the single-stranded specific nuclease S1 be-
fore ligation. Variations on these themes are to use DNA pol I in the
presence of only one, two, or three of the nucleotides to fill out part of
the single-stranded ends before nuclease treatment and ligation (Fig.
10.20). Mixing and matching entire restriction fragments from a region
under study is another closely related method of changing portions of
DNA binding sites or substituting one portion of a protein for another.
More  extensive  deletions  from  the  ends  of  DNA  molecules  can  be
generated by double-stranded exonuclease digestion. The nuclease Bal
31 from the culture medium of the bacterium Alteromonas espejiana is
particularly useful for this purpose. With it, a set of clones with progres-
sively larger deletions into a region can easily be isolated. The addition
of linkers after Bal 31 digestion permits targeted substitution of a set of
nucleotides or a change in the number of nucleotides between two sites.
Deletions entering the region from both directions are isolated. Before
recloning, a restriction enzyme linker is added. After these steps, a pair
of  deletions  can  be  easily  joined  via  their  linkers  to  generate  a  DNA
molecule identical to the wild-type except for the alteration of a stretch
comprising the linker (Fig. 10.21). The use of different pairs of deletions
place the linker in different locations so that the linker can be scanned
through a region to determine important areas.

Bases within DNA fragments can be changed with chemical in vitro
mutagenesis. Hydroxylamine will effectively mutagenize the cytosines
in  denatured  DNA  fragments,  which  can  then  be  renatured  and  re-
cloned. Alternatively, mutagenesis can be directed to particular regions.
One  method  is  to  generate  a  single-stranded  region  by  nicking  one

generate  a  gap.  The  mutagenesis  is  then  performed  with  a  single-
stranded specific reagent such as sodium bisulfite, which mutagenizes
cytosines and ultimately converts them to thymines, or by compelling
misincorporation of bases during repair of a gap.

Insertional inactivation can be used to kill specific genes in yeast (Fig.
10.22). This is a prerequisite to examining the in vivo consequences of
mutating  the  gene.  Suppose  that  a  cloned  copy  of  the  gene  to  be
inactivated  is  available.  Then  the  central  portion  of  the  gene  can  be
replaced by a segment of DNA encoding one of the genes necessary for
the synthesis of uracil. Uracil-requiring yeast cells are transformed with
the segment of DNA containing the gene segments and the URA region,
and selection is performed for cells able to grow without exogenously
added  uracil.  Since  the  ends  of  the  transforming  DNA  segment  are
highly recombinogenic, the fragment recombines into the X gene with
high frequency and replaces the former intact copy of the X gene with
the damaged copy. This replacement relieves the uracil requirement of
the  cells.  That  the  necessary  construct  has  been  generated  can  be
verified by Southern transfers. Restriction sites flanking the insertion
are moved further apart, increasing the size of this restriction fragment.
When the steps described above are performed on diploid yeast cells,
the result is one chromosome with an insertionally inactivated copy of
the X gene and a second, normal copy of the X gene. To test whether
the X gene is required for growth in haploid cells, haploids containing
the two chromosome types can then be generated by sporulating the
diploids. If the gene with the insertion is completely inviable, only two
of the four spores from each tetrad will be viable.

while  at  the same time preventing the reactive amino, hydroxyl, and
other phosphorus groups from reacting. With these techniques, he and
his co-workers then synthesized a complete tRNA gene. Originally many
person-years were required for the synthesis of 80 nucleotide oligomers.
Now, as a result of continued development by many research groups,
oligonucleotide synthesis has been highly automated and as many as
100 nucleotides may be joined in specific sequence in a day.

In chemical DNA synthesis, blocking groups are placed on the reac -
tive groups that are not to participate in the condensation to form a
phosphodiester. These are then condensed to build the oligonucleotide
(Fig.  10.23).  After  synthesis  of  the  complete  oligonucleotide,  all  the
blocking groups are removed. If the desired oligonucleotide is particu-
larly long, blocks of short, overlapping oligonucleotides can be synthe-
sized, hybridized, ligated, and finally cloned.

Before 1965, no researchers would have had a good idea of what to
do with the sequence of an entire chromosome if it were presented to
them. We are hardly in that situation now. Similarly, before 1975 there
seemed to be little reason to try to synthesize DNA chemically. Not only
were relatively few interesting sequences known, but the fraction of the
synthesized material that would possess the desired sequence was likely
to be too small to be of use. With the development of cloning since 1975
and the overall increase in our knowledge of biological mechanisms, the
picture dramatically changed. Now it is routine to synthesize a gene de
novo. Convenient restriction sites can be placed through the gene and

Pol  I  and  ligation  yields  heteroduplex  molecules  that  can  be  transformed.
Following DNA replication in the transformants, the two types of DNA mole-
cules segregate to yield wild-type or mutant homoduplexes. Retransformation
yields  colonies  containing  entirely  mutant  or  wild-type  DNA,  which  can  be
identified by hybridization with radioactive mutant oligomer.

when necessary, portions of the gene can be altered by synthesis of just
the region between two restriction enzyme cleavage sites.

Another  method  for  mutating  a  gene  is  to  direct  mutations  to  a
specific point. This can be done with chemically synthesized oligonu-
cleotides in a process called  oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis. An
oligonucleotide containing the desired alteration, a mutation, insertion,
or deletion, will hybridize to complementary, wild-type single-stranded
DNA and can serve as a primer for DNA pol I (Fig. 10.24). The resulting
double-stranded DNA  contains one  wild-type  strand  and one mutant
strand.  Upon  replication  in  cells,  one  of  the  daughter  duplexes  is
wild-type and the other is mutant. Sometimes it is necessary to prevent
heteroduplex repair of the mutant strand. Either way, following trans -
formation and segregation, a mutant gene can be obtained.

10.1.  DNA  can  be  injected  into  a  mouse  egg  and  implanted  in  a
pseudopregnant female from which baby mice are ultimately obtained
that contain copies of the injected DNA. How would you explain the
finding that sometimes the resultant mice are mosaics, that is, some of
the cells contain copies of the injected DNA and others do not? How
could you make use of these findings to determine useful information
about development of the mouse?

10.2. The homology between two sequences S1 and S2 can be com-
pared  by  the  dot  matrix  method  (see,  for  example,  Cell  18,  865-873
[1979]) as follows: A dot is placed in the ith row and jth column of the
comparison matrix (usually generated by computer) if the sequences S1
and S2 possess n out of m identical bases beginning with the ith base of
S1 and the jth base of S2. Typical operating parameters would be to
require identity in 8 out of 16 bases, that is, n = 8 and m = 16. Regions
of homology appear as lines of dots running downward to the right. How
would  you  use  the  dot  matrix  method  to  look  for  complementary
sequences regions in an RNA molecule that might base pair with one
another?

10.3.  Suppose  you  wished  to  use  directed  mutagenesis  against  a
portion of a gene coding for an essential enzyme in haploid yeast. How
could  you  simultaneously  inactivate  the  resident  chromosomal  gene
and substitute a portion of the gene that you had modified in vitro?

10.4. The restriction enzyme XbaI cleaves the sequence TTAGA and
HindIII  cleaves  the  sequence  AAGCTT.  Suppose  HindIII  cleaves  a
plasmid once in a nonessential region. By what simple procedure not
involving linkers or similar oligonucleotides could you clone XbaI-cut
restriction  fragments  into  HindIII-cut  plasmid  and  at  the  same time
eliminate any problems from reclosure of the plasmid without insertion
of the XbaI-cut DNA?

deciding on the nucleotide sequence to use when building a synthetic

10.6. If the efficiency of nucleotide addition in a DNA synthesizer is
98% per cycle, what would the overall efficiency be if you were synthe-
sizing a unique DNA sequence 150 bases long? What would you do to
obtain sizeable amounts of the sequence?

10.7. How could you use PCR technology to build gene fusions if you

could have the sequences for the genes involved?

10.8. Occasionally in walking along a chromosome of an organism
like Drosophila, a region of repeated DNA of the type used for generation
of DNA fingerprints is encountered. What problems does this generate
for the walk, and what could be done to jump over the region?

10.9. Why does the mapping of chromosomal markers using RFLPs

require statistical analysis?

10.10. How would you use the polymerase chain reaction to deter-

mine the splice site in an mRNA?

10.11. Sketch the products of PCR amplification after the first few
cycles when the original DNA template extends well beyond the sites to
which the primers hybridize.

10.12.  How  could  you  use  PCR  to  introduce  a  restriction  enzyme
cleavage site at a specific position on a stretch of DNA you have cloned
on a plasmid?

10.13.  Recently  it  has  been  found that a  human genetic disease is
worsened in succeeding generations. A specific repeated triplet within
a coding region of a particular gene increases from repeating several
times, to repeating perhaps half a dozen times. Devise a simple assay
that  could  detect  the  presence  of  such  an  expansion  in  a  small  cell
sample from a fetus.

Repression and the lac Operon

11

Having discussed genetics, genetic engineering and the structure and
biosynthesis of proteins and nucleic acids in the previous chapters, we
are now prepared to consider biological regulatory mechanisms. What
exactly is meant by “mechanism of regulation?”  The term refers to the
means  by  which  the  expression  of  a  specific  gene  or  set  of  genes  is
selectively increased or decreased, that is, induced or repressed. Thus a
protein that binds only under some conditions to the promoter of one
particular  gene  could  regulate  expression  of  this  gene,  whereas  ATP
would not be considered a regulator despite the fact that its presence is
necessary for expression of the gene. Changes in ATP levels would be
expected to affect expression of all genes similarly.

This section of the book describes regulation of the lac, ara, and trp
operons,  lambda  phage  genes,  Xenopus  5S  genes,  yeast  mating-type
genes, and genes involved in development. The prokaryotic genes are
chosen because much is known about their regulation and because each
is  regulated  by  a  dramatically  different  mechanism.  The  eukaryotic
systems represent clear examples of regulation and are good examples
of the use of recombinant DNA technology being applied to this type of
problem.

Much is known about the four prokaryotic systems, in part because
intensive study was begun on them well before similar studies became
possible on eukaryotes. Even before the development of genetic engi-
neering, investigators of the bacterial systems devised means of com-
bining genetics, physiology, and physical-chemical studies. The depth
to which the studies have penetrated has revealed general principles that
are  likely  to  be  operant  in  cells  of  any  type.  A  broad  diversity  of

331

332  Repression and the lac Operon

regulation mechanisms are used in the systems considered here. One
type is simple competition between lactose repressor and RNA polym-
erase for binding to DNA of the promoter region for the lac operon. A
more  complex  system  is  seen  in  the  ara  operon  in  which a series  of
proteins  binds  to  the  DNA  and  assists  RNA  polymerase  to  initiate
transcription of the ara operon. The trp operon displays a different facet
of gene regulation. In it, translation is coupled to transcription. Phage
lambda  and  the  yeast  mating-type  genes  show  still  more  complex
regulatory behavior. In lambda, a highly intricate cascade of regulatory
proteins regulates gene expression. The detailed mechanisms of gene
regulation are not as well known in eukaryotic systems, although many
are regulated by enhancer-binding proteins. The general principles used
in regulating the gene systems considered here cover a broad range, but
nature’s  diversity  in  gene  regulation  mechanisms  is  certainly  not  ex-
hausted  by  these.  Other  regulation  systems  display  both  minor  and
major differences.

Background of the lac Operon

The initial studies on the lac system, like those on most other bacterial
systems, were genetic. At the Pasteur Institute in Paris during World
War II, Monod began a study of the process of adaptation of E. coli to
growth on medium containing lactose. This first led to studies on the
origin of the enzymes that were induced in response to the addition of
lactose to the medium and then to studies on how the induction process
was  regulated.  Research  on  the  lac  operon  at  the  Pasteur  Institute
flourished and spread around the world, and for many years was the
most active research area in molecular biology.

By now, the essential regulatory properties of the lactose system have
been characterized as a result of extensive physiological, genetic, and
biochemical analyses. By no means, however, do we fully understand
what  happens  to  regulate  transcription  even  in  this  simple  system.
Current research on the lactose system includes study of what proteins
participate, which other proteins they interact with, and what they do.
It also includes the more fundamental questions of how RNA polym-
erase recognizes promoters and initiates transcription and how proteins
fold during their synthesis, recognize their substrates, and bind to other
proteins or to specific sequences on DNA.

mRNA

The lactose system consists of four genes that enable E. coli to grow
on lactose as a source of carbon and energy (Fig. 11.1). The regulatory
protein of the system is the product of the lacI gene. It is a repressor,
and when it is bound to the DNA it prevents transcription of the lacZ,
lacY,  and  lacA  genes.  The  product  of  the  lacZ  gene  is  the  enzyme
β-galactosidase which cleaves lactose to yield glucose and galactose. The
lacY  product  transports  lactose  into  the  cell,  and  the  lacA  product
acetylates some toxic galactosides to detoxify them. The three genes,
lacZ, lacY, and lacA constitute an operon by the strict definition of the
word since a single promoter serves more than one gene. We will also
use the word “operon” to refer to a transcriptional unit plus its related
regulatory sequences even if it contains a single gene.

Figure 11.2 shows the picture that has been derived for the mecha-
nism of regulation of the lac operon in E. coli. The lacI product binds to
a specific site in the promoter region, termed the operator or O1 site.
While bound to this operator, and in conjunction with the two other
operators located nearby, O2 and O3, it prevents RNA polymerase from
binding to or moving from the p1 promoter. The operators O2 and O3
are often called pseudo-operators, and they increase repressor binding
at O1 through loop formation in which repressor simultaneously binds
to O1 and either O2 or O3. Partially overlapping the p1 promoter is a
second promoter, p2. When repressor is not bound to the operators, then

334  Repression and the lac Operon

RNA polymerase has access to the two partially overlapping promoters
p1  and  p2.  Little  transcription  results  from  polymerase  binding  to  p2
because its isomerization rate is low. Normally, p2 plays no significant
role in the system because CRP protein at its binding site blocks access
of polymerase to p2. CRP also directly stimulates transcription from p1
promoter.

After lactose is added to a growing culture, the synthesis rate of the
lac enzymes ultimately is increased about a thousandfold. Curiously,
the induction requires activity of the very enzyme that is being induced,
β-galactosidase. The low uninduced, or basal, level of β-galactosidase
hydrolyzes some of the lactose that leaks into the cells or that enters via
the  basal  levels  of  lacY  protein.  In  a  side  reaction  the  enzyme  also
generates  allolactose  from  lactose.  The  binding  of  allolactose  to  re-
pressor reduces repressor’s affinity for operator by about a thousand-
fold.  As  a  result,  repressor  tends  to  dissociate  from  operator  and
transcription can begin. Shortly, the induced levels of β-galactosidase
and lactose transporter lead to higher intracellular levels of lactose and
allolactose and repression is further reduced.

The  efficient initiation  of  transcription  by  RNA  polymerase at  the
promoter of the lac operon requires not only the absence of bound lac
repressor but also the presence of cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP receptor
protein, which is called CAP or CRP protein. This auxiliary induction
requirement is thought to result from the fact that the carbon and energy
requirements of E. coli are most efficiently met by catabolizing glucose
rather than other sugars. Consequently, cells have evolved a way to shut
down the possibly inefficient use of other carbon utilization pathways
if glucose is present. This phenomenon is known as the  glucose effect
or catabolite repression. The glucose effect is generated in two ways: by
excluding inducers of some operons from the cell and by reducing the
inducibility  of  some  operons.  When  glucose  is  present  and  is  being
metabolized, the concentrations of cAMP are low, and few CRP proteins
contain bound cAMP. Only when CRP has bound cAMP, which occurs
when glucose is absent, can the protein specifically bind to DNA and
assist RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of the CRP-dependent
operons such as lac.

The Role of Inducer Analogs in the Study of the lac Operon

Compared to progress on many other problems in molecular biology,
research on the lac operon proceeded rapidly. In part, this was due to
the fact that measuring the response of the lac operon to changes in the
cell’s environment was easy. Addition of lactose induces the operon a
thousandfold, and the assay of β-galactosidase is particularly simple.
Another important  reason for the rapid progress is that many useful
analogs of lactose can readily be synthesized. These analogs facilitate
the assay of the lac operon proteins as well as simplify the isolation of
useful mutants.

The properties of several analogs are shown in Table 11.1.  ONPG is
particularly useful as its cleavage yields galactose and orthonitrophenol,

which when ionized at basic pH is bright yellow. This provides a simple
and sensitive assay for β-galactosidase which requires only a measure-
ment of the optical density after incubating enzyme and substrate. IPTG
is useful in inducing the operon for two reasons. First, IPTG induces by
binding  directly  to  the  repressor  so  that  the  presence  of  functional
β-galactosidase in the cells to generate the true inducer is unnecessary.
Second, IPTG is not metabolized. Therefore its use for induction does
not disturb the metabolic pathways of the cell as might be the case for
induction by lactose. Phenylgalactose is another useful analog. It is not
an inducer, but it can be metabolized if β-galactosidase is present to
hydrolyze  it.  Therefore  only  permanently  derepressed  cells  grow  on
medium  containing  phenylgalactose  as  the  sole  carbon  and  energy
source. Such permanently induced mutants are called constitutive and
result  either  from  defective  repressor  that  is  unable  to  bind  to  the
operator  or  from  mutant  operator  that  is  no  longer  recognized  and
bound by repressor. 

Proving lac Repressor is a Protein

The phenomenon of repression in the lac operon was characterized by
genetic  experiments.  These  showed  that  a  product  of  the  lacI  gene
diffused  through  the  cell  and  shut  off  expression  of  the  lac  genes.
Basically these were  complementation experiments that showed  that
lacI  acted  in  trans  to  repress.  A  LacI-LacZ+  strain  constitutively  ex-
presses β-galactosidase in the absence or presence of inducers. The  lacZ
gene in such  a strain is repressed if an episome is introduced which

336  Repression and the lac Operon

carries  a  good  lacI  gene  but  is  deleted  of  the  lacZ  gene.  The  genetic
structure of the resulting strain is denoted F’lacI+ ∆lacZ/lacI-lacZ+. That
is, LacI protein acts in trans to repress the chromosomal lacZ gene.

Once it was established that the LacI product repressed expression,
research  on  the  lac  operon  shifted  to  learning  what  repressor  was;
whether it was RNA or protein, and how it acted to block expression of
the lac enzymes. Since the target of the repressor was a sequence that
could be genetically mapped, two likely possibilities existed. The opera-
tor could be a region on the DNA to which repressor bound to reduce
the  intracellular  levels  of  functional  lac  messenger.  Alternatively,  re-
pressor  recognized  and  bound  to  a  region on  the lac  messenger  and
reduced  translation  efficiency.  Either  of  these  possibilities  required
recognition of a specific nucleotide sequence by the lacI gene product.
To many investigators, such an ability seemed most reasonable for an
RNA  molecule.  Indeed,  early  results  obtained  with  RNA  and  protein
synthesis inhibitors led to the conclusion that it was not protein. Gilbert
and Müller-Hill, however, reasoned that an RNA molecule was unlikely
to  possess  all  the  regulatory  properties  required  of  the  lacI  product.
Therefore Müller-Hill designed a simple genetic experiment that indi-
cated that repressor contained at least some protein.

His proof was that nonsense mutations could be isolated in the lacI
gene. A nonsense mutation can only be isolated in a gene that encodes
a protein. The starting point was a strain containing amber mutations
in  both  the  gal  and his  operons.  This  strain was then  made LacI- by
selection of constitutives. Most of these mutants were missense, but a
few  were  nonsense  I-  mutants.  Each  of  the  constitutives  was  then
reverted  simultaneously  to  Gal+  and  His+.  The  only  way  a  cell  could
perform  this  double  reversion  was  to  become  nonsense  suppressing,
Su+,  and  simultaneously  suppress  both  nonsense  mutations.  These
nonsense-suppressing revertants were then tested for lac constitutivity,

and a few were found to have simultaneously become I+. Consequently,
these were nonsense I mutations that were now being suppressed and
were forming functional repressor that turned off expression of the lac
operon in the absence of inducers. This proves that the I gene product
contains  protein,  but  it  does  not  prove  that  the  repressor  is  entirely
protein. The repressor had to be purified before it could be shown to be
entirely protein. 

An Assay for lac Repressor

Genetic and physiological experiments investigating properties of the
lac operon provided information from which a number of regulatory

An Assay for lac Repressor  337

mechanisms were proposed. These ranged from the logical mechanism
of lac repressor binding to DNA and inhibiting transcription to compli-
cated translational control mechanisms utilizing tRNA molecules. Clear
demonstration of the regulation mechanism required purification of its
components and in vitro reconstruction of the lac system.

The most important step in the reconstruction of the lac regulatory
system was the ability to detect repressor. Lac repressor, of course, had
to be highly purified from lysed cells. If regulation of the lac operon were
efficient–and that is the main reason for the existence of regulation–then
the  cell  should  contain  far  fewer  molecules  of  repressor  than  of  the
induced gene products. Furthermore, since lac repressor possessed no
known enzymatic activity, no easy and sensitive assay for repressor was
available. Without the ability to detect repressor, its purification was
impossible because any fraction obtained from purification steps that
was enriched in repressor could not be identified.

Repressor’s only known property was that it bound inducer, IPTG
being one. Therefore Gilbert and Müller-Hill developed an assay of lac
repressor based on the protein’s ability to bind to inducer molecules.
Equilibrium dialysis can detect a protein that binds a particular small
molecule. The protein solution to be assayed is placed in a dialysis sack
and dialyzed against a buffer that contains salts to maintain the pH and
ionic strength and the small  molecule that binds  to the protein (Fig.
11.3). 

In the case of repressor, radioactive IPTG was used. After equilibrium
has been attained, the concentration of free IPTG inside and outside the
sack is equal, but in addition, inside the sack are the molecules of IPTG
that are bound to repressor. If the concentration of repressor is suffi-
ciently high, the increased amount of IPTG inside the sack due to the
presence  of  repressor  can  be  detected.  Both  the  inside  and  outside
concentrations of IPTG can be determined by measuring the amount of
radioactivity contained in samples of known volumes taken from out-
side and inside the dialysis sack.

Does  an equilibrium  dialysis  assay  possess  sufficient sensitivity  to
detect the small amounts of lac repressor that are likely to exist in crude

extracts of cells? The binding reaction between repressor and IPTG is
closely approximated by the reaction

Rf + IPTG →← R⋅IPTG

where Rf is the concentration of free repressor, IPTG is the concentra-
tion  of  free  IPTG,  and  R⋅IPTG  is  the  concentration  of  the  complex
between repressor and IPTG. A dissociation constant KD describes the
relations between the concentrations:

KD = 

Rf × IPTG
.
R⋅IPTG

Substituting the conservation equation, Rf + R⋅IPTG = Rt, where Rt is the
total amount of repressor, and rearranging yields the relation we need.
Biochemists  have  many  different  names  for  the  equivalent  algebraic
rearrangements  of  this  equation  but  usually  call  the  phenomenon
Michaelis-Menten binding,

outside the sack is

Normally  in  liquid  scintillation,  counting  a  5%  difference  between
samples with more than 100 cpm can be readily determined. Thus the
quantity

must be greater than 0.05 for detection of lac repressor by this assay.

The Difficulty of Detecting Wild-Type lac Repressor

Before trying to detect lac repressor, Gilbert and Müller-Hill estimated
the signal that could be expected in the equilibrium assay and decided
that they were unlikely to detect wild-type repressor. Let us examine
such a calculation. Two quantities are needed: the dissociation constant
of repressor for IPTG and the concentration of repressor in cell extracts.
To make a crude guess of the dissociation constant of IPTG from lac
repressor, assume that the basal level of the  lac operon is proportional
to the fraction of lac operator uncomplexed with repressor. Assume also
that this fraction is doubled if the effective repressor concentration is
halved. Consequently, the basal level of the operon is doubled when half
the total repressor in the cell is bound to IPTG and half is free of IPTG.
The concentration of IPTG at which the 50-50 binding occurs and the
enzyme level is twice the basal level equals the dissociation constant for

IPTG binding to repressor. Although this concentration of IPTG could
be  measured  in  reasonably  straightforward  experiments,  it  can  be
calculated from data already known. The lac operon can be induced a
thousandfold and is half-maximally induced by 2 × 10-4 M IPTG (Fig.
11.4). Roughly, then, at an IPTG concentration of (2 ×  10-4)/500 = 4 ×
10-7 M IPTG, the level of expression of the lac operon will be twice the
basal level. Consequently an estimate of the dissociation constant of lac
repressor and IPTG is 4 × 10-7 M.

The volume of a cell is 10-12 cm3 = 10-15 liter. Using this value, a packed
cell pellet is 1015/(6 × 1023), or about 10-9 M in cells. If a cell contains 10
repressor  molecules,  the  concentration  of  repressor  in  a  packed  cell
pellet is 10-8 M. A cell lysate cannot easily be made at a higher concen-
tration than that obtained by opening cells in a packed cell pellet. Hence
a reasonable estimate for the concentration of repressor in the equilib-
rium dialysis assay is 10-8 M.

If high specific activity radioactive IPTG is available, it can be used

in the assay at a concentration well below the KD estimated above (see
problems  11.9  and  11.10).  Therefore  the  ratio  of  the  radioactivities
contained in samples of equal volumes taken from inside and outside

Detection and Purification of lac Repressor

The  previous  section  showed  that  wild-type  lac  repressor  in  crude
extracts  of  cells  was  not  likely  to  produce  a  detectable  signal  in  the
equilibrium dialysis assay. Therefore Gilbert and Müller-Hill isolated a
mutant  repressor  that  bound  IPTG  more  tightly  than  the  wild-type
repressor. Crude extracts made from this strain showed an excess of
counts in the dialysis sack. The excess was barely detectable; nonethe-
less  it  was  statistically  significant,  and  fractionation  of  the  extract
yielded a protein sample with an easily detectable excess of counts.

Once the assay of lac repressor detected something, it was of great
importance to prove that the origin of the signal was repressor and not
something  else.  The  proof  used  the  tight-binding  mutant.  First,  the
tight-binding  mutant  was  used  to  develop  a  partial  purification  of
repressor so that a fraction could be obtained in which the signal was
readily detectable. Then this same purification procedure was used to
obtain  a  similar  fraction  from  wild-type  cells.  This  too  generated  a
significant  signal.  The  proof  came  with  the  demonstration  that  the
apparent  dissociation  constants  for  IPTG  in  the  fraction  from  the
mutant  and  the  wild-type  were  different.  This  was  simply  done  by
performing the dialysis on a series of samples at different concentra-
tions of IPTG. The sample obtained from the mutant bound IPTG more
tightly. That is, it had a smaller KD, than the wild-type (Fig. 11.5). As the
only difference between the mutant and the wild-type was a mutation
in the lacI gene, the signal in the assay was from lac repressor.

The definitive detection of repressor opened the door to biochemical
studies. First, with an assay, the repressor could in principle be purified
and  used  in  biochemical  studies  probing  its  mechanism  of  action.
Second, it was possible to attempt to isolate mutants that synthesized
elevated quantities of repressor so as to ease the burden of purification.
With an assay, such candidates could be identified.

Repressor Binds to DNA: The Operator is DNA  341

A mutation rendering lac repressor temperature-sensitive was used
in the isolation of mutants possessing higher levels of repressor. Cells
were grown at a temperature just high enough to inactivate most of the
temperature-sensitive repressor. Consequently the lac operon was no
longer  repressed,  and  the  cells  expressing  the  lac  operon  were  then
killed. The survivors, which were able to repress the operon, could be
of two types. Either the repressor was altered so that it could repress at

the elevated temperature or more repressor was being synthesized. The
two types of mutants could easily be distinguished with the equilibrium
dialysis assay, and an overproducing mutant was identified.

The selection for the loss of constitutivity in the scheme described
above used yet another lactose analog, TONPG (o-nitrophenyl-1-thio-β-
D-galactoside). This inhibits growth when it is cleaved by β-galactosi-
dase,  but  it  is  not  an  inducer.  Mutant  cells  unable  to  cleave  this
compound  grow  in  its  presence.  Three  types  of  mutants  have  this
property:  the  desired  repressing  mutants  as  well  as  lacZ  and  lacY
mutants. Both of the undesired mutant types were easily eliminated by
requiring  the  mutants  to  grow  on lactose.  The selection  scheme  was
successful, and mutants were found that contained elevated amounts of
lac repressor. The isolation of the lacI overproducer was the first clear
example of the  successful  isolation of a promoter mutation  and  was
itself a breakthrough. The resulting IQ (Q for quantity) mutation mapped
at the beginning of the I gene, as expected for a promoter mutation, and
generated a 10-fold increase in the level of repressor.

Repressor Binds to DNA: The Operator is DNA

As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, we now know that
repressor acts by binding to the operator and preventing RNA polym-
erase from binding to the lac promoter. The first experiments to show
that repressor binds to lac DNA used ultracentrifugation of radioactive
repressor and the DNA from λlac phage. The DNA sediments at 40S,
whereas repressor sediments at 7S. If repressor bound so tightly to DNA
that it did not come off during the centrifugation, it would sediment at
about 40S. Indeed, DNA containing lac carried lac repressor along with
it down the centrifuge tube, but only if inducers of the lac operon were
not present (Fig. 11.6). These are the properties expected of repressor if
it were to regulate by binding to DNA to prevent transcription.

A  considerably  easier  assay  of  DNA  binding  by  lac  repressor  was
developed  later  by  Riggs  and  Bourgeois.  Pure  lambda  DNA  passes
through cellulose nitrate filters, but repressor, like many other proteins,

binds to the filters. It is bound by molecular interactions and not by
filtration.  Most  surprisingly,  if  repressor  is  bound  to  DNA,  the  DNA
molecule will not pass through the filter either. Thus if the DNA is made
radioactive, the retention of lac DNA on the filter can easily be detected,
providing a simple assay for repressor binding to operator (Fig. 11.7).
The  filter-binding  assay  is  very  sensitive  because  the  DNA  can  be
made highly radioactive with  32PO4 The long DNA molecule contains
many  phosphate  groups,  and  the  half-life  of  32P  is  short.  This  assay
facilitated measurement of the rates of binding and dissociation as well
as a determination of the equilibrium constant for binding.

For example, the rate of lac repressor dissociation from operator is
easily measured by mixing repressor with radioactive DNA so that the
majority of repressor is bound to operator. Then the solution is diluted
and a large excess of nonradioactive lac DNA is added. Any repressor
that  subsequently  dissociates  from  operator  either  remains  free  in
solution  or  has  a  much  greater  chance  of  binding  to  nonradioactive
DNA. At intervals after the dilution, the mixture is filtered to determine

the fraction of repressor still bound to the radioactive lac operator-con-
taining DNA. The kinetics in the reduction in the amount of radioactive
DNA bound to the filters with increasing time give the dissociation rate
of repressor from operator.

The Migration Retardation Assay and DNA Looping

Earlier it was mentioned that DNA can be subjected to electrophoresis
under conditions compatible with protein binding. For DNA fragments
in the size range of 50 to about 2,000 base pairs, the binding of a protein
significantly retards the migration. Therefore, free DNA and protein-
DNA complexes may easily be separated by electrophoresis and identi-
fied  by  staining  or  autoradiography.  An  additional  virtue  of  the
migration  retardation assay  is  the  fact  that  protein  and  DNA  can  be
incubated in buffers containing physiological concentrations of salt, on
the order of 50 mM KCl. Then, the electrophoresis can be performed at
very low salt concentration. As discussed earlier, salt has a dramatic
effect on the affinity with which most proteins bind to DNA. At low salt
concentrations,  most  proteins’ affinity is  much higher  than  at  physi-
ological salt concentrations. This greatly reduces the dissociation rate
of the proteins. Additionally, the presence of the gel surrounding the
protein-DNA complex cages the protein and further reduces its effective
dissociation rate during electrophoresis. These features make the gel
migration retardation assay particularly useful for the study of protein-
DNA  interactions  as  electrophoresis  “freezes”  a  particular  solution
condition.

Not surprisingly, the lac repressor-operator interaction can be stud-
ied with the migration retardation assay. The tetrameric lac repressor
can bind with two of its subunits to the main operator at the promoter.
Repressor’s other two subunits are free to bind to either of the pseudo-
operators that are located one hundred and four hundred base pairs to
either side. Such a double binding by a single repressor tetramer forms

a DNA loop. In vivo this looping reaction is facilitated by supercoiling.
The same looping reaction can be facilitated in vitro by using a linear
DNA fragment containing two strong repressor-binding sites separated
by 100 base pairs. Incubation of such DNA with low concentrations of
repressor permits binding of single tetramers to DNA molecules. These
form DNA loops so that each tetramer contacts two operators from the
same  DNA  molecule.  Incubation  at  higher  repressor  concentrations
forces a separate repressor tetramer onto each operator, and incubation
at high DNA concentrations forms structures in which repressors join
two DNA molecules in a sandwich structure (Fig. 11.8).

The Isolation and Structure of Operator

After the isolation of lac repressor and the demonstration that it bound
to DNA, interest turned to the structure of operator. The first questions
concerned  its  size  and  sequence.  Answering  such  questions  is  now
straightforward with the application of genetic engineering techniques.
The questions about the lac operator, however, came to the fore before
the  era  of  genetic  engineering.  Because  ingenious  techniques  were
developed and the work directly led to the development of many of the
genetic engineering techniques now used, we will review the techniques,
now outdated, used to isolate and sequence the lac operator.

Before  developing  their  chemical  sequencing  method,  Gilbert  and
Maxam sequenced the operator, primarily by direct DNA sequencing
methods,  whereas  somewhat  later  Reznikoff,  Barnes,  Abelson,  and
co-workers sequenced the entire lac regulatory region by purifying and

sequencing  RNA  copies  of  it  (Fig.  11.9).  Gilbert’s  method  required
isolation of pure operator itself. DNA was isolated from phage carrying
the lac genes. This DNA was sonicated to fragments about 1,000 base
pairs long, repressor was added, and the mixture was passed through a
cellulose  nitrate filter. The DNA fragments containing  operator were
bound  by  repressor  and  held  on  the  filter  whereas  the  rest  passed
through. Then the operator-containing fragments were specifically re-
leased by adding IPTG to the rinse buffer. Finally, repressor was again
bound to these fragments, and the portions of the fragments not pro-
tected by repressor were digested by DNAse. The operator was found to
be about 20 base pairs long, and it had been purified 2000-fold from the
phage or 20,000-fold from the E. coli DNA!

The lac operator possesses a symmetrical sequence. This suggested
that two of the repressor subunits symmetrically made contact with it
(Fig. 11.10). To probe the structure of lac-operator-repressor complexes,
Gilbert  and  Maxam  turned  to  DNA  protection  studies.  They  bound
repressor to operator and investigated the reaction of dimethylsulfate

protection pattern was obtained, but, more important, they noticed that
the  method  could  easily  and  rapidly  be  adapted  to  yield  the  actual
sequence of a DNA fragment. From this beginning they developed the
chemical method for sequencing DNA.

The equilibrium dissociation constant for repressor binding to operator
can be determined either from equilibrium measurements or from the
ratio of the association and dissociation rates. The dissociation constant
obtained by either of these methods can also be compared to in vivo
data. A correspondence in the numbers suggests, but does not prove,
that  the  in  vitro  reactions  and  conditions  closely  mimic  the  in  vivo
environment.

An  estimation  of  the  in  vivo  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  of
repressor for the operator uses the thousand-fold inducibility of the lac
operon. Assume that the operator is completely free of repressor when
the operon is fully induced and that the operator is free of repressor
1/1000 of the time when the operon is not induced. By definition,

KD = 

R × O
 .
RO

Earlier we discussed the fact that the concentration of repressor, R, is
approximately 10-8 M. The thousand-fold inducibility means that O/RO
is approximately 1/1000. Thus,

KD = 10− 8 1
1000
= 10− 11M.

This result closely agrees with the values found in vitro in buffers with
salt concentrations equal to the in vivo value of about 0.15 M.

The DNA-binding Domain of lac Repressor

How could genetic experiments determine the amino acid residues that
contact operator? Work by Miller and collaborators showed that non-
sense mutations lying early in the lacI gene did not abolish expression
of  the  entire  gene.  Although  the  ribosomes  terminate  translation  on
reaching  the  nonsense  codon,  often  they  do  not  dissociate  from  the
mRNA before reinitiating translation at a site within the lacI gene. As a
result, they synthesize a repressor molecule that lacks up to 61 of the
amino acids normally found at the N-terminus. Most surprisingly, these
truncated repressor polypeptides fold, associate as usual to form tetra-
mers, and bind IPTG. They are, however, incapable of binding to DNA
as shown in vivo by their inability to repress and in vitro by the DNA
filter-binding assay. The simplest explanation of their inability to bind
to DNA is that the amino acids missing from their N-terminus are the

part of the wild-type repressor that recognizes and binds to operator. In
addition, more detailed genetic analysis of the repressor have shown
that the overwhelming majority of missense mutations affecting DNA
binding by the repressor map in the region of the I gene coding for the
first 60 amino acids.

A  typical  LacI-  mutant  is  recessive  to  the  wild-type  lacI  gene. The
amino-terminal truncated repressors, however, are dominant negatives.
That is, the diploid lacI+/lacI-d behaves like an I-. As explained in Chapter
8,  the  dominance  of  I-d  mutations  to  the  I+  allele  results  from  the
tetrameric structure of repressor and the fact that all four subunits are
required for full repression.

The steps to combine to isolate a particular mutant sometimes are
not  apparent,  so  we  will  list  and  explain  a  series  of  genetics  steps
designed to isolate an I-d mutant.

1.  Isolate  I-  mutations  using  phenyl-β-D-galactoside  plates.  Since
phenyl-gal is not an inducer, but is a substrate of β-galactosidase, any
cells growing on these plates must be constitutive.

2. Score to determine which are nonsense I- mutations. The muta-
tions can be isolated on an episome, F’lac+ pro+. To test, the episome can
be mated into an F- su+ strain. This strain should be deleted of lac and
pro genes. To determine whether the episome in the suppressing strain
is  I+  or  I-,  the  plates  can  include  5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β−D-D-
galactoside (X-gal). If X-gal is included in minimal glycerol plates, the
constitutives will form deep blue colonies because the hydrolysis of this
substrate by β-galactosidase produces an insoluble blue dye.

3. Map the locations of the I- mutations. This can be done using the
ability of strains containing the mutation on an episome and a deletion
into the I gene on the chromosome to reconstruct an I+ gene (Fig. 11.11).
A point mutation is able to recombine with deletion 1 but not deletion
2 to form I+ recombinants. Although this type of mapping only positions
the  mutation  to  the  left  or  right  of  the end  point of the  deletion,  an
ordered set of deletions can be used to locate the mutation to within
about 10 base pairs.

How can the selective plates be arranged to permit growth of only the
cells that can reconstruct a functional I gene? The plates must prevent
growth of each of the parent types of cells as well as mated cells that are
unable  to  form  a  wild-type  lacI  gene.  This  can  be  done  by  using

348  Repression and the lac Operon

phenyl-gal and glycerol in plates. The deletion mapping can be done in
a GalE- strain. The resulting defective galactose epimerase gene renders
the cells sensitive to galactose. The LacI- cells are constitutive and cleave
the phenyl-gal to produce galactose, which then prevents their growth.
A LacI+ recombinant, however, represses β-galactosidase synthesis and
does  not  generate  galactose.  Such  cells  can  continue  to  grow  in  the
presence of phenyl-gal.

4. Test the candidates for being trans-dominant repressor negative.
This is done by mating the episome into an I+ strain and selecting for
transfer of the pro marker. This strain is tested by spotting onto X-gal
plates as before.

5.  Physical  studies  of  the  repressor  from  the  I-d  mutants  can  test
whether the repressor is a tetramer, and SDS gels can show that the
mutated repressor is shorter than wild-type.

Protein  sequencing  can  provide  the  final  proof  that  the  repressor
synthesized  in  the  nonsense  I-d  mutants  results  from  translational
restarts.  The  mutant  repressor  can  be  purified  by  precipitation  with
antibody,  separated  from  the  antibody  by  SDS  gel  electrophoresis,
eluted from the gel, and the N-terminal amino acids sequenced.

A Mechanism for Induction

How do inducers reduce repressor’s affinity for operator? It is possible
that they bind near the operator-binding site and merely interfere with
repressor’s correct binding to operator. This possibility seems unlikely

Repressor

Operator

in view of the genetic data and the separability of the IPTG-binding and
operator-binding substructures of repressor discussed above. It seems
more likely that IPTG merely causes the subunits of repressor to alter
positions slightly with respect to one another. Why should this drasti-
cally weaken the binding? Experiments with the N-terminal DNA-bind-
ing domain contain the answer.

The  DNA-binding  domain  binds  to  operator  with  a  much  lower
affinity  than  wild-type  repressor.  Such  reduced  affinity  actually  is
expected. The wild-type tetrameric repressor molecule possesses a rela-
tively rigid structure in which pairs of the N-terminal regions are held
in positions appropriate for binding to a single operator. That is, the
binding  of  one  of  the  N-terminal  regions  to  half  of  the  symmetrical
operator perforce brings a second N-terminal region into position for
its  binding  to  the  other  half  of  the  operator.  Therefore  most  of  the
additional interaction energy between this subunit and the DNA can be
used to  hold  the complex  onto the DNA (Fig. 11.12). This is another

example of the chelate effect. Overall, the result is that the oligomeric
repressor tightly binds to operator. The same is not true of the isolated
N-terminal domains. The binding of one of these DNA-binding domains
does not automatically bring another into position for binding to the
other  half  of  operator.  As  a  result  of  their  independent  binding,  the
apparent affinity of a single DNA-binding domain for operator is low.
The  chelate  effect  also  streamlines  the  explanation  of  induction:
binding  of  IPTG  shifts  pairs  of  subunits  away  from  optimal  relative
positions for headpiece binding to operator. Consequently, the affinity
of repressor for operator is greatly reduced, and repressor dissociates.
Eventually, direct experiments may be able to test such ideas. In the
meantime,  two  types  of  repressor mutations are  consistent  with this
point of view. Repressor mutants can be found that are not located in
the N-terminal region and that result in much tighter or much weaker
repressor-operator binding. These mutants possess no discernible struc-
tural alterations. Most likely these types of mutation merely shift the
positions  of  the  subunits  slightly  with  respect  to  one  another.  The
tighter-binding mutant must bring the subunits into closer complemen-
tarity  with  operator,  and  the  weaker-binding  mutants  must  shift  the
subunits away from complementarity.

An enormous amount  has  been learned about the lac operon, and
only  a  fraction  was  mentioned  in  this  chapter.  More  remains  to  be
learned about the physiology and physical chemistry underlying regu-
lation of this set of genes and others.

those that lead to the protein not being able to fold at high temperatures

which lead the protein to be heat-unstable regardless of the temperature
at which it folded. Invent a selection for TSS Z- mutations and for TSS

question, now hypothetical, of whether repressor blocks the binding or
the transcriptional progress of RNA polymerase.

11.5. Transcription of a region of DNA could alter the probability of
recombination in that interval. Design an experiment to measure the
effect of transcription on recombination. What precautions would be
needed?

11.6. The induction curve of the lac operon versus IPTG concentra-
tion is approximately quadratic, that is, cooperative. The Gilbert and
Müller-Hill paper shows that the IPTG binding to repressor obeys the
equation derived in the text, that is, it is Michaelis-Menten. Is there a
contradiction here? Why or why not?

11.7. The presence of the active transport system for the lac operon
allows the system to behave as a bistable flip-flop by inducing at a high
lactose concentration and then remaining induced at a lactose concen-
tration well below that required for induction (Fig. 11.13). Let Ci be the
concentration of IPTG  inside  cells  and Co its  external concentration.
Assume  that  the  degree  of  induction  of  the  transport  system  as  a
function of Ci and the ability of the transport system to concentrate IPTG
as a function of Co are as shown in Fig. 11.14 where 100% induction is

fully  induced  cells  that  are  put  into  10-6  M  IPTG  remain  induced
indefinitely. Also show that if uninduced cells are put into 10-6 M IPTG
they do not induce despite minor fluctuations in the levels of enzymes
and the active transport capabilities. Show that the curve b does not
produce this bistable response.

“promoter.” Observe the varying usages of the term in the papers J. Mol.

(1968), and others these papers lead you to. Comment on the uses and
make a suitable definition of your own.

at 1 × 10-6 M, what are the dpm per 0.1 ml sample inside and outside
the sack. Assume KD = 4 × 10-6 M, 1 µCi = 1.2 × 106 dpm.

(b) What is the ratio if the IPTG concentration is lowered to 1 × 10-7

M?

(c) Is it of any use to use very high specific activity IPTG?
11.10. If the dissociation constant of IPTG from lac repressor, instead

of being 2 × 10-7 M,

(a) were 1 × 10-8 M, could repressor have been detected in the original

experiments?

(b) were 2 × 10-5 M, but the specific activity of IPTG had been 10 times
higher, could lac repressor have been detected in the original experi-
ments?

11.11. Devise a method for the isolation of a lacI mutation in which

repressor binds IPTG less tightly than the wild-type repressor.

11.12. Like many proteins, lac repressor binds to nitrocellulose filters.
Quite unexpectedly, however, if IPTG is bound to repressor, it is not
easily released when repressor has stuck to the filters. Thus if radioac-
tive IPTG is used, only lac repressor can bind radioactivity to the filters,
and this constitutes a convenient assay for lac repressor. The assay is
limited to the use of small quantities of protein, however, since about a
monolayer  of  protein  on  the  filters  prevents  further  protein  binding.

Molecular  biologists  were  greatly  surprised  to  discover  that  nature
regulates gene activity in more than one way. Many of the early molecu-
lar biologists had been trained as physicists and perhaps this conserva-
tism  was  a  carryover  from  physics  where  relatively  few  principles
govern  a  broad  range  of  phenomena.  As  we  have  already  seen  in
previous chapters, biological systems like the mechanism of DNA rep-
lication show a surprisingly large variability between organisms. This
variability first became apparent during examination of the mechanism
of gene regulation in the arabinose operon. Data began to accumulate
indicating that this set of genes is regulated by a protein that turned on
their  expression  rather  than  turned  off  their  expression  as  had  been
found in the lactose operon. Because nature’s variability at this level was
not  yet  appreciated,  once  the  lactose  operon  was  characterized  as
negatively regulated, evidence that a different gene system might not be
regulated similarly was received by some with hostility. Now, of course,
we understand that, at this level, nature uses an almost endless set of
variations.  The  challenge  now  is  discerning  and  understanding  the
underlying principles.

Genetic study of the arabinose operon of Escherichia coli was begun
by Gross and Englesberg and pursued for many years by Englesberg.
The work started as a straightforward genetic mapping exercise using
phage P1. As data began to accumulate that indicated that the regulation
mechanism  might  not  be  a  simple  variation  of  that  used  in  the  lac
operon,  Englesberg  began  a  more  intensive  characterization  of  the
system. The mechanisms regulating the arabinose operon are yet to be
fully understood. This chapter will explain how the genetic data indi-

cated that the operon is positively regulated, and then consider the in
vitro experiments  that proved  that the system is positively regulated.
Next, the unexpected findings that indicated that the ara system is also
negatively regulated will be discussed. These led to the discovery of the
“action at a distance” phenomenon, which was first explained in the ara
system as the result of looping the DNA so as to bring together two sites
that are separated by 200 base pairs. Subsequently, looping has been
found  in  many other  systems  and  is  a  general mechanism to permit
proteins bound at some distance from a site to influence what happens
at the site. 

The Sugar Arabinose and Arabinose Metabolism

The pentose L-arabinose occurs naturally in the walls of plant cells. The
bacterium E. coli, but not humans, can use this sugar as a source of
carbon and energy. Therefore arabinose is a free meal to intestinal flora
when  we  eat  a  meal  containing  vegetables.  Before  arabinose  can  be
metabolized by the bacterial intracellular arabinose enzymes, it must
be transported from the growth medium through the inner membrane
to  the  cytoplasm.  This  is  performed  by  two  independent  arabinose
transport systems, the products of the araE and araFGH genes. The araE
system  possesses  a  low  affinity  for  arabinose  and  therefore  is  most
effective  in  the  presence  of  high  concentrations  of  arabinose.  The
araFGH system possesses high affinity for arabinose uptake and there-
fore may be most valuable when arabinose concentrations are very low,
on the order of 10-7 M.

Arabinose, like many sugars, exists in solution predominantly in a
ring  form  in  either  of  two  conformations.  These  interconvert  with  a
half-time of about 10 minutes (Fig. 12.1). Therefore it is possible that
one  of  the  transport  systems  is  specific  for  the  α  anomeric  form  of
arabinose and the other transports the β form. The β form is a substrate
for  the  first  enzyme  of  the  catabolic  pathway,  but  it  is  not  known
whether the other ring form or the linear form, which exists in only trace

concentrations, might be the true inducer and play a role analogous to
that of the true inducer, allolactose, of the lac operon.

The duplication of arabinose uptake systems hindered their genetic
and physiological study because mutants are then difficult to identify.
A defect in either system is masked by the activity of the other system.
The genes coding for the enzymes required for arabinose catabolism,
however, have been easier to map and study. They are located near the
top of the genetic map as it is usually drawn (Fig. 12.2). Arabinose is
first  converted  to  L-ribulose  by  arabinose  isomerase,  the  araA  gene
product. Then ribulose is phosphorylated by ribulokinase, the product
of the araB gene, to yield L-ribulose-5-phosphate (Fig. 12.3). The ribu-
lose phosphate is next converted to D-xylulose-5-phosphate by the araD
gene product, ribulose phosphate epimerase. Xylulose phosphate enters
the pentose phosphate shunt, and the enzymes subsequently involved
are not induced specifically by the presence of arabinose.

The  genes  of  the  two  arabinose  active  transport  systems  plus  an
additional arabinose-inducible gene of unknown function map to three
different regions of the chromosome. These are different from the map
locations of the genes required for the catabolism of arabinose. There-

Induction, Repression, and the araBAD Operon

fore a total of four sets of genes have been discovered whose activities
are regulated by arabinose. Why should this be? Why not have all the
genes  in  one  large  operon?  Two  possible  reasons  will  be  discussed
below.

At low arabinose concentrations, a high-affinity, but perhaps energy-
inefficient or low-capacity, uptake system might be necessary for the
cells to be able to utilize any arabinose at all. On the other hand, in the
presence of high concentrations of arabinose, a different uptake system
might be more useful. One with a high transport rate would be neces-
sary. This need not have a particularly high affinity for arabinose. These
different needs would necessitate splitting the corresponding genes into
separate operons so that they could be differentially regulated. Alterna-
tively,  suppose  arabinose  were  suddenly  presented  to  bacteria,  as  it
might be in the gut. It is to the cell’s great advantage to begin metabo-
lizing this new nutrient just as soon as possible. If, however, all the genes
for the uptake and metabolism of arabinose were in a single long operon,
then the interval from induction until RNA polymerase could transcribe
to  the end of the operon would be about three minutes. Any strain that
divided its arabinose operon into two or three separately transcribed
units could induce all its ara enzymes more quickly and begin apprecia-
ble arabinose metabolism a minute or two sooner than cells with an
undivided arabinose operon. This time saved each time the operon was
induced could be of enormous selective value over evolutionary time
scales. 

Induction of the arabinose operon also requires the presence of cyclic
AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein CRP. The main role of this
protein  is  to  enable  induction  of  the  arabinose  operon  only  in  the
absence of glucose. This prevents the cell’s attempting to utilize arabi -
nose  when  glucose,  which  is  a  better  carbon  source,  is  present.  The
general phenomenon of being able to induce an operon well only in the
absence of glucose is called catabolite repression. A significant number
of bacterial operons display catabolite repression. 

Genetics of the Arabinose System

Most mutations in the arabinose operon generate the expected pheno
-
types.  The  araB,  araA, and araD  genes lie in one transcriptional unit
served  by  promoter  pBAD  (Fig.  12.4),  and  mutations  in  these  genes
abolish the activity of the enzyme in question as well as leave the cells
arabinose-negative. Mutations in araD, however, have the useful prop-
erty that they make the cells sensitive to the presence of arabinose due
to  their  resulting  accumulation  of  ribulose  phosphate.  This  type  of
sensitivity is not an isolated case, for high levels of many sugar phos-
phates in many types of cells are toxic or growth inhibitory.

The  arabinose-sensitivity  of  AraD-  cells  provides  a  simple  way  to
isolate  mutations  in  the  arabinose  genes.  AraD-  mutants  that  have
further  mutated  to  become  resistant  to  arabinose  contain  mutations
preventing the accumulation of ribulose phosphate. Each cell capable
of  growing  into  a  colony  must  contain  a  secondary  mutation  in  the

isolated by spreading large numbers of AraD- cells onto plates contain-
ing  arabinose  and  some  other  source  of  carbon  and  energy,  such  as
glycerol or yeast extract. The few cells that grow into colonies contain
additional  mutations  in  araC,  B,  or  A.  This  scheme  does  not  yield
transport-negative mutants since both transport systems would have to
be inactivated before the cells would be arabinose-resistant, and such
double mutants are too rare to be detected.

The behavior of mutations in one of the arabinose genes was para-
doxical. The cells became arabinose-negative, but no enzymatic activity
could  be  associated  with  the  gene.  In  fact,  none  seemed  necessary
because the other arabinose gene products performed all the required
metabolic conversions. Additionally, cells with mutations in this gene,
araC, had the strange property of not possessing any of the arabinose-
induced enzymes or active transport systems (Table 12.1). If the gene
product were not any of the logical proteins, perhaps it wasn’t a protein.
This wasn’t possible, however, because nonsense mutations existed in
the  araC  gene.  Only  genes  encoding  proteins  can  possess  nonsense
mutations. Therefore, the araC gene product had to be a protein.

Formally,  the  behavior  of  the  araC  mutants  was  consistent  with
several regulatory mechanisms. First, contrary to expectations preva-
lent at the time of this work, araC could code for a positive regulator,

one  whose  presence  is  necessary  for  synthesis  of  the  other  ara  gene
products. Second, araC could code for a component directly involved
with the uptake of arabinose into cells. Its absence would mean that the
intracellular  level  of  arabinose  would  never  become  high  enough  to
permit derepression of the arabinose genes. Third, araC could be part
of a double-negative regulation system (Fig. 12.5). That is, AraC protein
in  the  presence  of  arabinose  could  repress  the  synthesis  of  the  true
repressor of the arabinose operon. In this case, if araC were inactive or
arabinose were absent, then the repressor would be synthesized and the
arabinose enzymes would not be synthesized.

Detection and Isolation of AraC Protein

However ingenious, genetic and physiological or cloning and mapping
experiments suffer from the defect that they are rarely able to provide
rigorous  proofs  of  mechanisms  of  action.  Proof  of  a  model  usually
requires purification of the system’s individual components and in vitro
reconstruction of the system. How then could biologically active AraC
protein  be  purified  for  biochemical  studies?  Detection  of  the  lac  re-
pressor, which had been accomplished earlier, was difficult enough. Its
isolation  capitalized  upon  its  tight-binding  to  an  inducer  of  the  lac
operon, IPTG. Not even this handle was available for detection of AraC
protein. In vivo experiments measuring the induction level of arabinose
enzymes in cells as a function of the intracellular arabinose concentra-
tion showed that the affinity of AraC protein for arabinose was too low
to  permit  its  detection  by  the  equilibrium  dialysis  that  was  used  to
isolate lac repressor.

Work  on  the  isolation  of  AraC  was  performed  well  before  genetic
engineering permitted facile isolation of many proteins. Now proteins

often can be detected and purified merely by engineering such a great
hypersynthesis that cell lysates possess a prominent new band upon SDS
gel electrophoresis. Such gels then provide a way to follow the purifica-
tion of the overproduced protein, but they do not ensure that the protein
is biologically active. How can an assay be devised for the biological
activity  of  AraC  protein?  The  only  activity  that  possesses  sufficient
sensitivity was based on the ability of AraC protein to induce synthesis
of the araBAD genes. Working with the lac operon, Zubay had developed
a means of preparing a partially fractionated cell lysate in which added
DNA could be transcribed and translated. When a concentrated source
of  lacZ  DNA  is  added  to  this  system,  lac  mRNA  is  synthesized  and
translated into active β-galactosidase. This system was adapted to the
arabinose genes to search for the AraC protein.

The necessary coupled transcription-translation system consists of a
cell  extract  from  which  much  cellular  DNA  and  all  mRNA  has  been
removed (Fig. 12.6). Then DNA template, salts, amino acids, and en-
zyme cofactors are added. The cell extracts must be made from araB
mutants so that the small quantities of the araB enzyme, ribulokinase,
which will be synthesized in vitro, can be detected. Also, the extracts
must be free of AraC protein so that it can be detected on its addition
to the extracts. Of course, it is sensible that the source of AraC protein
be as concentrated as possible as well as lack ribulokinase. Finally, a
highly concentrated source of araB DNA must be added to the synthesis
extract.

It  was  possible  to  meet  the  various  requirements  of  the  in  vitro
system. The extract for in vitro synthesis was prepared from cells deleted
for the araCBAD genes. The source of AraC protein was the araCBAD
deleted cells infected with a phage carrying the araC gene but not an
active  araB  gene.  The source of  araB  DNA was a phage  carrying  the
arabinose  genes.  Of  course,  similar  experiments  done  at  the  present
time  would  utilize  plasmids  carrying  the  desired  genes.  When  the
ingredients  were  mixed,  AraB  protein  was  synthesized  only  if  both
arabinose and AraC-containing extract were added to the reaction. This
result rigorously excludes the possibility that AraC protein only appears

366 

Induction, Repression, and the araBAD Operon

to regulate positively because its actual role is transporting arabinose
into cells. It also makes the possibility of a double repressor regulation
system exceedingly remote.

Of  course,  the  last  word  on  the  positive  nature  of  the  regulation
system  came  with  a  completely  pure  in  vitro  transcription  system
consisting  of  just  cyclic  AMP  receptor  protein, RNA polymerase, ara
DNA, and AraC protein plus arabinose, cAMP and triphosphates. Ara-
specific messenger is synthesized if and only if these components and
arabinose are present in the reaction. The fact that this system works
also  shows  that  the  regulation  is  exerted  at  the  level  of  initiation  of
transcription rather than via degradation of mRNA or even at a trans-
lational level.

Although  the  assay  was  cumbersome,  the  coupled  transcription-
translation system permitted quantitation of AraC protein in fractions
obtained from purification steps. Micrograms of the protein could be
purified. When the araC gene was fused to the lacZ promoter and placed
on a high-copy-number plasmid the level of AraC protein reached values
permitting straightforward purification. Now it is possible in just a few
days  to  purify  20  milligrams  of  the  protein.  This  facilitates  physical
experiments designed to examine the basis of the protein’s activities.

Repression by AraC

In the presence of arabinose, AraC protein induces expression of the
metabolic and active transport genes. That is, it is a positive regulator.
Most unexpectedly, AraC protein also appears to repress expression of
these  genes.  Three  types  of  experiments  demonstrate  the  repression
exerted by AraC protein. The simplest utilizes Ara+ revertants that are
isolated in strains deleted of the araC gene. These mutations are called
Ic. They lie in the pBAD RNA polymerase-binding site and they permit a
low rate of polymerase binding and initiation in the absence of AraC
protein. Repression is revealed by the fact that the constitutive promoter
activity of the Ic mutants is reduced by the presence of AraC protein.
The protein can act in trans to repress just like the lac repressor.

Experiments with the Ic mutations also show that at least part of the
site required for repression of pBAD lies upstream from all of the sites
required  for  induction.  This  is  shown  by  the  properties  of  strains
containing the two deletions, ∆1 or ∆2. ∆1 extends just to the end of the
araC  gene  and  ∆2  ends  beyond  the  araC  gene,  so  that  half  of  the
regulatory region between the araC and araBAD genes containing pBAD
has been deleted. The promoter pBAD in both of the strains is undamaged

by the deletions because it remains fully inducible when AraC protein
is  provided  in  trans.  Repression  of  the  Ic  mutation  by  AraC  protein
occurs only in the strain containing ∆1 (Table 12.2). Therefore at least
part of the site required for repression has been deleted by ∆2.

Conceivably,  the  repression  exerted  by  AraC  occurs  only  in  the  Ic
mutants. Therefore experiments will be described that do not use the Ic
mutations. The experiments use the same two deletions as described
above,  ∆1  and  ∆2.  AraC+∆(BAD)  episomes  are  introduced  into  the
deletion strains. When these cells are grown in the absence of arabinose,
the basal level in the strain containing ∆1 is normal but the basal level
in the strain containing ∆2 is 10 to 30 times normal. This result confirms
the repression effect and also shows that in the absence of arabinose, a
little of the AraC protein is in the inducing state and can weakly induce
pBAD if the region defined by ∆2 has been deleted.

A third demonstration of repression in the ara system utilizes araC
constitutive mutations, araCc. This type of mutation causes the arabi-
nose enzymes to be induced even in the absence of the normal inducer,
L-arabinose. Diploids containing both araCc and araC+ mutations are
surprising,  for the  C+ allele is  almost  completely  dominant to the Cc
allele (Table 12.3). C+/Cc diploids possess nearly the normal uninduced
level of arabinose enzymes in the absence of arabinose and nearly the
fully induced level of enzymes in the presence of arabinose. In light of
the other experiments showing repression, these results are most simply
explained  as  resulting  from  repression  by  the  C+  protein  despite  the
presence of the Cc protein. These results, however, are also consistent
with AraC protein being an oligomer in which the in vivo dominance of
C+ results from subunit mixing.

Figure 12.7  The presence of arabinose drives AraC protein into the inducing
state, which acts  positively at the I site.  Before arabinose addition, the protein
was acting negatively through the O site.

The araCc mutants mentioned above are easily isolated with the aid
of the arabinose analog 5-methyl-L-arabinose, which is also known as
D-fucose. D-fucose cannot be metabolized by E. coli, but it does interact
with AraC protein to inhibit the normal induction by arabinose. Mutants
able to grow on arabinose in the presence of fucose are called araCc

The results described above indicate that AraC protein can induce or
repress the initiation of transcription of the arabinose operons in E. coli.
AraC protein must therefore exist in at least two states, a repressing and
an  inducing  state,  and  arabinose  must  drive  the  population  of  AraC
protein molecules in a cell toward the inducing state (Fig. 12.7). The
deletions show that the most upstream site required for repression lies
further upstream than the most upstream site required for induction.
By analogy to the lac operon, the site required for repression is called
an operator, O. The I site stands for induction.

Regulating AraC Synthesis

The  araC  gene  is  oriented  oppositely  to  the  araBAD  genes,  and  its
promoter, pC, is adjacent to the regulatory sites for the BAD operon. This
location raises the possibility that the activity of pC might be regulated
by the same proteins that regulate the activity of pBAD.

Since  the  measurement  of  AraC  protein  is  difficult,  lengthy,  and
imprecise, Casadaban chose not to study regulation of the pC promoter
by measuring AraC protein itself but instead to fuse the promoter to the

β-galactosidase gene(Fig. 12.8). The assay of this protein is simple. The
general strategy of fusing β-galactosidase to promoters has become a
widespread tool. It is used not only in the study of bacterial genes, but
also in higher cells. Its use in Drosophila, for example, permits facile
study of the spatial and temporal specificity of gene regulation. Also, the
Berk-Sharp  S1  nuclease  mapping  method  which  was  discussed  in
Chapter  5  now  permits  a  straightforward  characterization  of  the  pC
promoter  activity  under  a  variety  of  conditions.  The  original  pC-lacZ
fusion was constructed in a series of intricate genetic operations. First
the  β-galactosidase  gene  was  brought  near  the  araC  gene  and  then
intervening DNA was deleted so that the structural gene of β-galactosi-
dase was fused to pC. Hence the measurement of β-galactosidase became
a measurement of the activity of pC.

The  first  finding  was  that  pC  is  stimulated  about  threefold  by  the
presence of cyclic AMP-CRP. A more surprising finding was that pC is
about six times more active in the absence of AraC protein than in its
presence.  That  is,  AraC  protein  represses  its  own  synthesis.  A  third
finding was that on the addition of arabinose to cells, the level of araC
messenger increases about fourfold in several minutes and then slowly
falls back to its prior level (Fig. 12.9). Whether this transient derepres-
sion is of any physiological value is unknown. One might expect that the
resulting elevated level of AraC protein could facilitate induction of the
ara operons not already saturated with the protein.

Binding Sites of the ara Regulatory Proteins

Now that the regulatory phenomena of the ara operon have been laid
out, what can be said about its mechanism of regulation? The nucleotide
sequences of the promoters pBAD, pE, pFGH, show three distinct regions
of homology among themselves. One of these is the RNA polymerase-
binding site. Another is the cyclic AMP receptor protein-binding site,
and the third is the AraC protein-binding site. Inexplicably, the araBAD

pC and the araI site is required for induction.

RNA polymerase-binding site is quite similar to the RNA polymerase
sites  of  promoters  that  do  not require  auxiliary  proteins  for activity.
Since pBAD requires the auxiliary proteins AraC and CRP for its activity,
the polymerase-binding sequence might have been expected to be mark-
edly different from the consensus RNA polymerase-binding sequence.
The identity of the protein-binding sites was established by DNAse
footprinting. In araBAD, the AraC protein-binding site is just upstream
from RNA polymerase, and the CRP-binding site is just upstream from
that  of  araC  (Fig.  12.10).  The  AraC-binding  site  is  called  araI  for
induction. These three sites are required for induction of pBAD.

A  second  AraC  protein-binding  site  called  araO1  lies  another  60
nucleotides upstream of araI. This site overlaps the RNA polymerase-
binding  site  of  pC,  and  since  occupancy  of  araO1  by  AraC  protein
sterically interferes with the binding of RNA polymerase at pC, araO1 is
an operator of pC. AraO1 is not directly involved with repression of pBAD.
A simple demonstration of this is the behavior of pC and pBAD as the level
of AraC protein is increased in a series of strains containing plasmids
with araC fused to promoters of different strengths. As the level of AraC

protein is increased,  pC  shuts  down but pBAD remains  fully  inducible
(Table 12.4).

Deletion analysis showed that one of the sites required for repression
of pBAD lies beyond araO1. It is called araO2, and it lies 270 base pairs
upstream  from  the  pBAD  transcription  start  point.  Footprinting  has
confirmed that AraC protein binds to this site, and mutation analysis

has shown that a single nucleotide change in this region can eliminate
repression of pBAD. Deletion of this site is the reason that the original
deletion that was isolated by Englesberg could no longer repress pBAD
but could induce. His deletion extended through araO2 into araO1, and
during the interval of several years between the discovery of O1 and the
discovery of O2, araO1 was thought to be required for repression of pBAD.
The  location  of  the  CRP  site  required  for  stimulation  of  the  pBAD
promoter  is  most  surprising.  In  the  lac  operon,  the  CRP  site  lies  at
positions -48 to -78 with respect to the start of transcription, just next
to RNA polymerase. At the ara promoter, AraC protein occupies this site
and CRP lies further away, binding to positions -80 to -110. CRP makes
specific contacts with RNA polymerase in activating transcription of the
lac promoter. Does it make a different set of specific contacts with AraC
protein, and does AraC protein make yet another set of contacts with
RNA  polymerase?  Alternatively,  both  proteins  might  simultaneously
contact RNA polymerase to activate transcription, but it seems more
likely that CRP activates through a DNA bending mechanism and that
AraC activates through direct protein-protein contacts.

DNA Looping and Repression of araBAD

How  can  repression of  pBAD be  generated from the araO2 site that is
located more than 200 base pairs upstream? There are three possibilities
(Fig. 12.11). A signal could be transmitted through the DNA, for exam-
ple, by changing the angle of the base tilt; something could polymerize
along the DNA starting at araO2 and finally cover araI; or the DNA could
bend back and bring the araO2 region near pBAD. This latter possibility
was shown to be the case by a series of experiments in which the spacing
between araO2 and the promoter region was varied. If five base pairs,
which is half a helical turn, are added between these two sites, the ability
to repress is greatly diminished, but if 11 base pairs are added, the ability
to repress is restored. An addition of 15 base pairs eliminates repression,
and a longer addition of 31 base pairs restores repression.

These results show that the absolute distance between the two sites
is not greatly important but that the angular orientation between the

two is. This implies that the DNA loops back to form contacts between
AraC protein bound at araO2 and something in the promoter region. If
the protein at araO2 is on the opposite side of the DNA (Fig. 12.12), the
additional energy required to twist the DNA half a turn so the sites again
face one another is too great and the loop required for repression does
not form. The isolation of repression deficient point mutations located
the  sites  necessary  for  repression.  As  expected,  some  were  in  araO2.
Additional repression negative mutations were in araI, thereby identi-
fying the other end of the loop.

The lac operon was the first well-understood gene system. The genes of
the lac operon are turned on when lac repressor dissociates from the lac
operator and the genes are turned off when the repressor binds. Every-
one  came  to  believe  that  the  turning  on  or  off  of  gene  activity  was
accomplished by the acts of binding or dissociation of proteins from
DNA. In the ara operon the repression that occurs in the absence of
arabinose involves the araI site, for mutations in araI can interfere with
repression. In the presence of arabinose the araI site is also required for
induction.  These  facts  require  that  at  least  part  of  the  araI  site  be
occupied by AraC protein both in the presence and absence of arabinose.
Induction  results  from  changing  the  state  or  conformation  of  AraC
protein, and not the de novo binding or dissociation of the protein. A
crucial test of the looping model that made these predictions was that
araI be occupied by AraC protein in the absence of arabinose. 

How can one test for the binding of a specific protein to a specific
site in growing cells? Dimethylsulfate can be used for footprinting in
addition to DNAse. In contrast to DNAse, dimethylsulfate easily enters
cells. Its rate of methylation of guanines at a protein’s binding site can
be either increased or decreased by the presence of the protein. Follow-
ing a brief treatment with dimethylsulfate, analogous to light nicking
by DNAse in DNA footprinting, the frequency of methylation at different
guanines can be measured by isolating, labeling, cleaving at the posi-
tions of methylations and separation of fragments on a sequencing gel.
In vivo footprinting showed that AraC protein occupies araI both in
the  absence  and  presence  of  arabinose,  thus  fulfilling  an  essential
requirement  of  the  looping  model.  The  footprinting  experiments
showed a second fact. The araO2 site, to which AraC protein binds only
weakly in vitro, is also occupied in vivo. This is as required by the looping
model. It is not, however, occupied when the araI and araO1 sites are
deleted. That is, its occupancy depends on the presence of sites located
more than a hundred nucleotides away. This is, of course, what happens
in looping. It is the cooperativity generated by looping that leads to the
occupancy of araO2. The binding of AraC protein to araI increases its
concentration in the vicinity of araO2 to such an extent that this second
site is occupied.

The degree of cooperativity generated by the looping can be roughly
estimated. AraC protein is present at about 20 molecules per cell. This
is a concentration of about 2 × 10-8 M. The concentration of araO2 in the
presence of araI can be estimated to be at least 10-6 M. Thus, by virtue
of  looping,  the  concentration  of  AraC  protein  near  araO2  can  be  in-
creased more than 100-fold. 

How AraC Protein Loops and Unloops

Two lines of in vivo evidence suggest that the loop between araI and
araO2 is broken upon the addition of arabinose. First, the operon is fully
inducible if araO2 is deleted. This implies that the loop is not involved

374 

Induction, Repression, and the araBAD Operon

with induction. Second, the occupancy of araO2 falls immediately after
arabinose addition. One good way to study such regulated looping is to
perform in vitro experiments. AraC loops sufficiently weakly, however,
that looping of linear DNA just does not occur. Instead, looping had to
be studied using small supercoiled circles of about 400 base pairs. These
are sufficiently small, and the supercoiled DNA is sufficiently wound
upon itself, that AraC protein can easily bridge the gap between araO2
and araI. These supercoiled, looped circles migrate upon electrophore-

sis at a rate different from free circles or circles with AraC bound at a
single  point.  Therefore  binding,  looping,  and  unlooping  can  all  be
assayed. 

Study of the looped supercoils revealed an unexpected property. As
AraC is a dimer in solution, and a dimer binds to linear DNA containing
the  araI  site,  it  had  seemed  likely  that  the  looped  species  would  be
formed from a dimer of AraC bound to araI and a dimer bound to araO2.
This proved not to be the case. The looped species contains only one
dimer! In the absence of arabinose one of the monomers of an AraC
dimer binds to the left half of araI, and the other monomer binds to
araO2 (Fig. 12.13). The left and right halves of araI are called araI1 and
araI2.  Upon  the  addition  of  arabinose  the  protein  reorients,  and  the
subunit contacting araO2 lets go, and contacts araI2. The subunit rear-
rangement  occurs  in  the absence  of  free  protein and  is  largely  inde-
pendent of the precise sequences at the sites involved. In the absence of
arabinose the protein prefers to loop, that is, contact to nonlocal sites.
In the presence of arabinose, the protein prefers to contact local sites.
The contacting of the araI2 site by AraC protein provides the inducing
signal to RNA polymerase. Only if this site is properly positioned so as

to overlap partially the -35 sequence of pBAD does AraC activate tran-
scription.

One simple mechanism that could generate the observed behavior of
AraC protein is a subunit reorientation. Suppose that in the absence of
arabinose the subunits are oriented such that binding to two half-sites
in a looping structure is energetically easier than binding to two adja-
cent half-sites. Then the protein would prefer to loop in the absence of
arabinose. If the presence of arabinose causes the subunits to reorient
so that binding to the two half-sites of araI is favored, then the protein
would unloop, bind to both halves of araI, and induce pBAD.

The data supports a slight modification of the reorientation model
outlined  above.  AraC  protein  monomers  consist  of  a  dimerization
domain flexibly connected to a DNA-binding domain. The half-sites to
which AraC binds normally are oriented in a direct repeat orientation.
AraC still binds with high affinity when one half-site is inverted so that
the total site possesses inverted repeat symmetry. This shows that the
dimerization  and  DNA-binding  domains  are  flexibly  connected.  Fur-
ther, the half-sites of araI can be separated by an additional 10 or 21
base  pairs,  or  even  inverted,  without  greatly  affecting  the  affinity  of
AraC. When, however, arabinose is added, the affinity of AraC for the
wild-type araI site, the  “+10” site, and the inverted site is increased, but
that for the “+21” site is decreased. Because arabinose did not increase
the affinity of AraC for all the sites, arabinose cannot be increasing the
intrinsic  affinity  of  a  DNA-binding  domain  for  a  half-site.  Instead,
arabinose alters the relative positions of the DNA-binding domains or
changes the flexibility or length of the connection between the dimeri -
zation and DNA-binding domains (Fig. 12.14).

Induction, Repression, and the araBAD Operon

Why Looping is Biologically Sensible

DNA  looping  solves  three  regulation  problems  involving  DNA.  This
regulation  can  be  of  gene  expression,  DNA  recombination,  or  DNA
replication. The discussion below is couched in terms of gene regula-
tion, but the same arguments apply to the other looping situations. The
first problem solved is that of space. Most gene regulatory proteins must
bind to specific DNA sequences to be able to direct their activities to
specific promoters. There may not be room immediately adjacent to a
bound RNA polymerase for all the proteins that need to affect transcrip-
tion from that promoter. DNA looping provides a solution. A regulatory
protein can bind at some distance from an initiation complex and still
directly affect transcription by means of DNA looping.

The second problem that DNA looping helps solve is concentrations.
This is particularly a problem in eukaryotic cells. Many cell-types have
the capability of inducing very large numbers of genes. This means that
the relevant regulatory proteins must all be present in the nuclei of these
cells. The concentration of any single regulatory protein cannot be high
since all the proteins must share the same volume. Therefore the system
might try to design the binding sites so that the regulatory proteins bind
particularly tightly to the DNA. Unfortunately, such tight-binding could
interfere  with  other  cellular  operations  like  replication,  repair,  and
recombination. Nonetheless, systems can be built so that the binding
affinity of the proteins for the sites is not too high and yet the binding
sites are well occupied. The general method of doing this is to increase
the concentration of the protein in the immediate vicinity of its binding
site. DNA looping accomplishes this.

The third problem DNA looping solves concerns time. Due to the low
concentrations of the individual regulatory proteins that must be main-
tained  within  cells,  significant  time  could  elapse  until  a  regulatory
protein could find its site and bind. If the protein is already on its site,
but kept from activating transcription by looping, then induction can
be extremely rapid. It is merely the time required to unloop. 

Why Positive Regulators are a Good Idea

One of the reasons for positive regulatory systems is even more impor-
tant for eukaryotic cells. Let us use the lac regulatory system as the basis
for comparison. At any instant, more than half of the lac repressor in a
bacterial cell is nonspecifically bound at nonoperator sites. If the cell
contained  a  thousand  times  as  much  DNA,  then  at  least  a  thousand
times as much lac repressor would be required to maintain full repres-
sion of the lac operon. If the cell contained 20,000 operons regulated by
repressors  with  similar  characteristics,  then  the  nucleus  could  not
accommodate the total amount of regulatory proteins required to regu-
late  these  operons.  Of  course,  it  may  be  possible  for  a  repressor  to
possess greater selectivity than lac repressor has for its operator site,
but there has to be an upper limit.

Problems

Problems  377

Positive regulatory systems do not require high levels of repressor to
maintain  low basal expression  rates  since a  positively  regulated pro-
moter is naturally off. For many genes, the occupancy of only a fraction
of  the  promoter  regions  by  positive  regulators  may  be  sufficient  to
provide sufficient activity to the promoter when it must be turned on.

12.1. How could subunit mixing explain the dominance of C+ to Cc

without requiring that C+ protein be a true repressor?

12.2. Frequently it is claimed that phosphorylation of sugars prevents
their leakage out of cells. If this were the case, it would seem reasonable
to phosphorylate arabinose before the other enzymatic conversions. Is
there a biochemical reason for not phosphorylating arabinose before
the isomerization step?

12.3. Suppose that two different missense mutations in the arabinose
isomerase were found to complement one another. How could this be
possible? Suppose that a point mutation in the araC gene could none-
theless yield Ara+ cells when a particular CRP mutation was introduced
into the cell. What could you infer about the functioning of the system,
and what could you conclude definitely?

12.4. What experiment would be the best to determine whether α- or
β-L-arabinose is actively transported by cells? What value would it be
to further research to know which it is?

12.5. Why is it of interest to know whether AraIc promoters can be

repressed in strains lacking active CRP?

12.6. Suppose that dominant Ara- mutations are very rare but do exist.

Devise an efficient selection method for their isolation.

12.7. Why do you expect that placing a lac operator between araO1
and araO2 would somewhat increase araBAD inducibility in LacI+ but
not in LacI- cells?

12.8. The PaJaMa experiment, named for Pardee, Jacob, and Monod,
consists of mating F’I+Z+ episomes into F- cells deleted of the lac region.
Immediately  after  entry  of  the  episome  into  the  female,  synthesis  of
LacZ  protein  begins,  but  its  synthesis  is  turned  off  after  about  30
minutes because of the accumulation of lac repressor.  What  could  a
PaJaMa experiment tell about the arabinose operon and what strains
would be needed?

12.9. Devise an efficient method for recombinational mapping of Cc

mutations.

12.10. Why is it a paradox if experiments show that a deletion from
pC  into  the  CRP-binding  site  in  the  pBAD  promoter  of  the  arabinose
operon leaves the promoter pBAD partially inducible, but is completely
uninducible  in  strains  unable  to  synthesize  cyclic  AMP? What  is  the
interpretation of this finding? Note, arabinose is able to leak into such
cAMP- cells perfectly well. 

378 

Induction, Repression, and the araBAD Operon

12.11. Two variants, A and B, were made with insertions  in nones-
sential sites between araO1 and CRP and between CRP and araI. One
can  imagine  two  possible  sets  of  results  for  the  inducibility  of  these
strains. What would each data set suggest as to the mechanism of CRP
protein function in induction of the arabinose operon?

O1 and CRP
Insertion between
CRP and I

Possibility A

Possibility B

12.12.  How  could  you  test  the  possibility  that  the  role  of  CRP  in
induction of pBAD is to help break the repression loop? Does this make
biological sense?

12.13. The claim has been made that the existence of temperature-
sensitive mutations in the araC gene proves that the gene product is a
protein. Why is such reasoning faulty?

12.14. Design an experiment to show whether or not the turn down
in the activity of pC 10 minutes after the addition of arabinose is due to
catabolite repression generated by the metabolism of arabinose.

12.15. Cells  growing on either a rich broth medium or on glucose
minimal medium were treated with nitrosoguanidine or UV. Each of
the resulting two groups of rifamycin-resistant mutants was then tested
for  its  Ara  phenotype.  What  is  an  explanation  for  the  appearance  of
Rifr-Ara-  double  mutants  only  when  cells  were  treated  with  ni-
trosoguanidine and then only when they had grown on rich medium?
12.16. Lac UV5 is a mutation that makes activity of the lac promoter
independent of cyclic AMP receptor protein. Suppose promoter minus
mutants  of  lac  UV5  occur  at  a  frequency  of  10-9.  Suppose  also  that
promoter minus mutations in the arabinose operon occurred only at a
frequency of 10-10. Not only that, but on analysis, all of these turn out
to  be  little  insertions  or  deletions,  whereas  the  lac  mutations  were
primarily base changes. What would be the best interpretation of these
data?

12.17. What would you conclude if a small fraction of AraC- muta-
tions could be suppressed by compensating mutations in RNA polym-
erase,  but  that  no  mutations  exist  in  AraC  that  can  be  corrected  by
mutations in CRP protein?

12.18. Estimate the effective concentration in molarity of the araO2

site in the vicinity of the araI site.

Operon

Attenuation and the trp Operon

13

In  the  previous  chapter  we  saw  an  example  of  regulation  of  gene
expression by control of RNA polymerase initiation frequency. Many of
the mechanisms appearing in regulation of the arabinose operon also
apply to eukaryotic systems as well. In this chapter we shall consider a
different mechanism of gene regulation, one that first appeared to be
confined to prokaryotic cells, but which now is known to function in
eukaryotic cells as well. This is controlling transcription termination at
a special point after the mRNA has been initiated but before the RNA
polymerase  has  completed  transcription  of  the  operon’s  structural
genes. Each transcript that is initiated has two possible fates. Either its
synthesis terminates before the completion of the entire messenger, or
no  premature  termination  occurs,  and  useable  messenger  is  synthe-
sized. Regulation alters the ratio of incomplete to complete messenger.
That is, the effectiveness of termination is regulated. Often this type of
regulation  mechanism  is  termed  attenuation.  Ribosomal  RNA,  ribo-
somal proteins, amino acid biosynthetic genes, and other genes whose
expression  rate  is  related  to  growth  rate  of  the  cells  use  attenuation
mechanisms. In this chapter most of our attention will be directed to
the  trp  operon.  In  it  we  shall  see  that  the  major  regulator  of  the
effectiveness  of  trp  messenger  RNA  transcription  termination  is  the
secondary structure of the RNA itself.

No cells are continuously exposed to ideal growth conditions. Indeed,
the majority of the time Escherichia coli cells are exposed to adverse
conditions, and growth is slowed or stopped. From time to time how-
ever, spurts of growth are possible when nutrients suddenly appear or
when populations of cells at high concentration are diluted. Therefore

386  Attenuation and the trp Operon

cells must possess regulatory mechanisms that turn on and turn off at
appropriate times the synthesis of enzymes like those of the tryptophan
biosynthetic pathway. Three important cellular states should be consid-
ered with respect to synthesis of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes:
 1. Tryptophan is absent, but otherwise cells are capable of synthe-

sizing protein;

2.  Tryptophan  is  absent,  and  in  addition,  no  protein  synthesis  is

possible for additional reasons;

3. Tryptophan is present;
Only in the first state is it sensible for cells to synthesize trp messenger
RNA. In both the second and third states it is energy-efficient for cells
not to synthesize trp messenger RNA. A simple repressor mechanism
like that of the lac operon that blocks synthesis of messenger whenever
tryptophan is present would permit synthesis of trp messenger whether
or not protein synthesis is possible. This is insufficient. In addition, cells
need a way to tell when tryptophan is absent but protein synthesis is
possible. The tryptophan operon has evolved a clever way to do this.

The Aromatic Amino Acid Synthetic Pathway and its Regulation

The  first  chemical  reaction  common  to  the  synthesis  of  tryptophan,
tyrosine, and phenylalanine is the condensation of erythrose-4-P and
phosphoenolpyruvate  to  form  3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-P,
DAHP, a reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthetase (Fig. 13.1). Due to its
position at the head of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway
and to the  fact that  this reaction is  irreversible, it is logical that this
reaction should be a key point of regulation. Indeed, this expectation is
met. Escherichia coli regulates both the amount and activity per mole-
cule of DAHP synthetase as a function of the intracellular levels of the
aromatic amino acids.

A double regulation of total DAHP synthetase activity is logical. While
regulation of the enzyme level minimizes unnecessary consumption of

amino  acids  and  energy  in  the  synthesis  of  the  enzyme,  this  type  of
regulation is incapable of producing appreciable changes in the enzyme
levels or of total enzyme activity on time scales shorter than minutes. A
much more rapidly-responding regulation mechanism is also necessary
to adjust the synthesis rates of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine
on time scales of seconds.

In addition to stabilizing the activity of the synthetic pathway against
random fluctuations, a rapidly responding regulation would fine-tune
the biosynthetic flow rates of the aromatic amino acids and would be
able to respond rapidly to growth rate changes generated by changes in
the nutrient medium. Feedback inhibition of an enzyme’s activity meets
the requirements, as this mechanism can alter an enzyme’s activity in
milliseconds.

Feedback  inhibition  is  an  example  of  an  allosteric  interaction  in
which accumulation of the product of the pathway leads to inhibition
of the activity of an enzyme in that pathway. This is a specific example
of an allosteric interaction in which a molecule dissimilar in shape to
the substrates of an enzyme can bind to the enzyme, usually at a site on
the enzyme far from the active site, and can generate conformational
changes that alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Feedback inhibi-
tion can reduce an enzyme’s activity in either of two fundamental ways
(Fig. 13.2). The tryptophan-sensitive DAHP synthetase is feedback-in-
hibited  largely  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  its  Vmax,  whereas  the  first
enzyme of  the  pathway used solely for tryptophan synthesis, anthra-
nilate synthetase, is an example of the other possibility. It is feedback-
inhibited by tryptophan via a change in its Km.

Bacillus subtilus possesses a single DAHP synthetase whose synthesis
and activity is regulated by the three aromatic amino acids. Escherichia
coli, however, possesses three different DAHP synthetases. The activity
of one, the AroH protein, is feedback-inhibited by tryptophan, another
is feedback-inhibited by tyrosine, and the third is feedback-inhibited by
phenylalanine.  Only  if  the  cell’s  growth  medium  possesses  all  three
amino acids is all DAHP synthetase activity within an E. coli cell fully
inhibited.

388  Attenuation and the trp Operon

This is an example of the fact that different microorganisms possess
different overall schemes for the regulation of tryptophan synthesis. On
one hand, it is possible that the different evolutionary niches occupied
by  different  microorganisms require these different  schemes. On  the
other  hand,  perhaps  one  scheme  is  no  better  than  another,  and  the
different ones just happened to have evolved that way. Either way, this
diversity means  that the overall scheme  for regulation of tryptophan
synthesis in E. coli is not the only one that works.

Rapid Induction Capabilities of the trp Operon

The tryptophan operon consists of five genes that code for the enzymes
unique to the synthesis of tryptophan, trpE, D, C, B, and A (Fig. 13.3).
In  addition,  the  trpR  gene  codes  for  a  repressor  that  helps  regulate
expression  of  these  genes.  TrpR  repressor  protein  bound  to  the  trp
operator blocks access of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Since this
repressor binds to trp operator far better in the presence of its corepres-
sor tryptophan than in its absence, the transcription of the  trp genes is
repressed in the presence of excess tryptophan and derepressed during
times of tryptophan deficiency.

A  classical  repression  mechanism,  in  which  the  repressor  protein
blocks binding or initiation by RNA polymerase, is adequate for meeting
part of the regulatory requirements of the tryptophan operon. Such a
regulation mechanism, however, cannot monitor the overall capability
of the cell to synthesize protein, and it would permit trp mRNA synthesis
whenever tryptophan was in short supply, even when protein synthesis
was impossible. Such a mechanism is not adequate for regulating an

amino acid biosynthetic operon. In the next section we shall discuss how
the cell can link protein synthetic ability to mRNA synthesis. Before that,
however, we shall examine an amusing consequence of repression in trp
as well as look at one possible reason for the existence of repression in
the trp operon.

TrpR  represses  synthesis  of  messenger  for  aroH,  which  encodes
DAHP synthetase messenger as well as the trp operon messenger. For
both, in the presence of tryptophan, it binds to DNA and blocks RNA
polymerase from binding to the promoter. An interesting variation is
shown between the two promoters. In the trp operon, the operator is
centered  around  the  -10  region  of  the RNA  polymerase  binding  site,
whereas in the aroH operon, the repressor-binding site is located around
the -35 region. Since both of these operators are similar, the -10 region
of the trp promoter and the -35 region of the aroH promoter can only
weakly resemble the sequences typical of these regions in active pro-
moters (Fig. 13.4). Apparently to compensate for this drastic alteration
in part of the RNA polymerase-binding site, the other portions of the
RNA polymerase-binding sites of these two promoters are homologous
to highly active consensus promoter sequences.

In addition to regulating the trp operon and aroH, TrpR repressor in
the presence of tryptophan also represses its own synthesis. As we will
see, the consequences of this self-repression are that the cellular levels
of  the  trp  enzymes  can  rapidly  increase  to  optimal  levels  following
tryptophan starvation. The ara operon uses a positive-acting regulation
mechanism to generate a rapid induction response followed by a lower
steady-state  response  as  catabolite  repression  turns  down  induction
once catabolism of arabinose begins. The, trp operon achieves a rapid
response using only negative-acting elements.

How  is  the  rapid  enzyme  induction  accomplished?  Consider  cells
growing  in the presence of excess tryptophan. In such a case the trp
operon,  trpR,  and  aroH  genes  are  all  repressed,  but  not  fully  off.  A
balance is maintained such that the level of TrpR repressor represses
the trpR gene so as to maintain that level. Upon tryptophan starvation,
these genes are all derepressed, and the gene products are synthesized

at  a  high  rate  (Fig.  13.5).  As  the  intracellular  concentration  of  TrpR
repressor and tryptophan itself both increase, appreciable repression
can set in, and transcription of the three sets of genes decreases. Finally,
when steady state has been reached in minimal medium lacking tryp-
tophan, the trp operon is 90% repressed, in part because the level of trp
repressor is much higher than it is in the presence of tryptophan.

The Serendipitous Discovery of trp Enzyme Hypersynthesis

We  now  return  to  the  main  topic  of  this  chapter.  The  discovery  of
polarity is an illustration of the fact that frequently the most important
discoveries result from attempting to solve some other problem. Polarity
is the decrease in the expression of a gene downstream in an operon
from a nonsense mutation. This phenomenon commanded the attention
of many molecular biologists from 1970 to about 1976. Experiments by
Yanofsky and Jackson at this time were designed to study the phenome-
non  of  polarity  by  locating  within  the  trp  operon  any  elements  that
affected polarity. They sought to isolate deletions that eliminated the
polar  effects  of  a  mutation  near  the  beginning  of  the  operon  on  the
expression of a gene near the end of the operon. As deletions are rare to
begin with, special selections and scorings must be used to identify cells
containing the desired deletion. The basic selection method was to use
conditions in which polarity reduced expression of a promoter-distal trp
gene  to  the  extent  that  cells  could  not  grow  and  then  to  select  for
secondary mutants that could grow. Among them would be deletions

removing  any  elements  that  generated  polarity.  Scoring  by  replica
plating onto petri plates spread with lawns of phage carrying parts of
the trp operon then identified the candidates containing deletions inter-
nal to the trp operon.

The last two genes of the tryptophan operon, trpA and trpB, code for
the α and β subunits of tryptophan synthetase. This enzyme normally
has  an  α2β2  structure.  The  synthetase  from  a  trpA  mutant  has  a  β2
structure. This dimer possesses part of the enzyme’s normal activity and
catalyzes the conversion of indole and serine to tryptophan and water
at about 3% the rate that the wild-type enzyme catalyzes the conversion
of serine and indole-3-glycerol phosphate to tryptophan and water. The
activity of the β2 complex is such that if indole is present in the growth
medium, tryptophan can be synthesized at a rate sufficient to supply
the cells’ tryptophan requirements. The reduction in expression of the
trpB gene in a trpA mutant strain containing a polar trpE mutation leaves
the cells unable to convert indole to tryptophan at a rate adequate for
growth  (Fig.  13.6).  Under  these  conditions,  a  deletion  of  the  trpE
mutation  that  does  not  include  the  trp  promoter  and  the  trpB  gene
relieves the polarity on trpB expression and permits cells to satisfy their
tryptophan requirements with indole. Amongst the indole+ colonies will
be deletions of various sizes. One test was determining their sizes.

Candidates  were  scored  for  loss  of  the  trpD  and  trpC  genes  with
special phage that carried copies of these genes, but with mutations in
the genes. The phage can infect cells, but many cells are not lysed. Often
the phage either recombine into the chromosome or simply remain in
the cell for several generations until diluted away by cell growth. While
present in the cells, the phage can recombine with homologous DNA on
the host chromosome if it is present. Thus, cells that retain trpD or trpC
can reconstruct a functional trpD or trpC genes on some copies of the
phage.  These  can  subsequently  be  detected  by  replica  plating  onto
another lawn of trpC or trpD mutant cells. By these means Jackson and
Yanofsky  identified  many  internal  deletions  in  the  trp  operon  that
relieved polarity. We might have expected that fusions of the trpB gene

to  other  genes  of  the  chromosome  might  also  have  occurred,  but,
curiously, none were found.

Out of 34 internal deletions that had removed polarity on the expres-
sion of the trpB gene, all were still regulated by the Trp repressor. Most
unexpectedly, two deletion strains hypersynthesized the TrpB protein
by a factor of three to ten; each of these was deleted of all of the trpE
gene (Fig. 13.7). The source of this hypersynthesis was then examined
more carefully, as described in the next section.

Early Explorations of the Hypersynthesis

The experiments described in this section were performed before the
development of modern genetic engineering. It is interesting to see how
Yanofsky and his collaborators cleverly utilized the technology available
at  the  time  to  learn  the  source  of  the  hypersynthesis  and  thereby
discover  the  phenomenon  of  attenuation.  The  first  question  in  their
careful  investigation  was  whether  the  hypersynthesis  in  the  internal
deletion  strains  mentioned  above  resulted  from  an  alteration  in  the
levels of messenger. Either more messenger was present in the deletion
strains or messenger was being translated more efficiently. The path of
subsequent experiments depended on which it was.

Messenger  RNA  in  cells  was  briefly  labeled  with  tritiated  uridine,
extracted, and hybridized to complementary trp DNA immobilized on

paper. Trp-containing DNA was available in the form of φ80 and λ phage
in which part of the phage genome was substituted with trp sequences.
Use of such phage containing all or part of the trp operon substituted
for  the  use  of  fragments  that  today  would  be  isolated  by  restriction
enzyme cleavage of an  appropriate plasmid or  by PCR  amplification
using  appropriate  primers  and  crude  E.  coli  DNA  as  template.  The
hybridization revealed that in all strains, the levels of trpB messenger
paralleled the levels of TrpB enzyme. Therefore the cause of trp enzyme
hypersynthesis  in  some  of  the  internal  deletion  strains  was  elevated
messenger levels.

Some  of  the  internal  deletion  strains  hypersynthesized  the  TrpB
protein and messenger and some did not. Hence it was important to
learn  whether  the  effect  could  be  correlated  with  the  extent  of  the
deletion.  This  was  particularly  important  because  sequencing  of  trp
messenger had revealed that the trp operon contained an unexpectedly
long  leader  of  162  bases  between  the  start  of  transcription  and  the
translation start of the first trp enzyme.

The deletion end points were determined by isolating trp messenger
synthesized in vivo by the deletion strains. Total RNA from the deletion
strains was isolated and hybridized to wild-type trp DNA (Fig. 13.8). The
region of complementarity between the RNA and DNA was resistant to
RNAse. After the digestion, this region was then melted off the DNA and
the exact extent of trp-specific sequence obtained from each deletion
was apparent on RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing was used since DNA
sequencing techniques had not yet been invented. It was found that only
those deletions that removed a site located 20 nucleotides before the
trpE gene hypersynthesized TrpB protein.

Conceivably,  the  deletions  caused  hypersynthesis  by  altering  the
activity of the trp promoter, although this possibility seemed unlikely
because some of the deletions in the hypersynthesizing strains ended as

far as 100 nucleotides downstream from the promoter. More likely, the
deletions removed a site located 20 bases ahead of the start of the trpE
gene that terminated most transcription before it entered the trp struc-
tural  genes.  This  idea  was  tested  by  comparing  the  amount  of  trp
messenger specified by a sequence lying upstream of the trpE gene and
upstream of the potential termination site to the amount of messenger
specified by sequences downstream from the site (Fig. 13.9). The down-
stream messenger contained the trpB region of the operon. A two-step
hybridization permitted quantitation of messenger RNA in cells from
each of these regions. This experiment provided the telling clue. Wild-
type repressed cells as well as trpR- cells contained an eight-to-ten-fold
molar excess of messenger from the leader region preceding the trpE
gene over messenger from the trpB region. In cells deleted of only the
critical region just ahead of the trpE gene, the amount of trpB messenger
was elevated and was nearly comparable to the amount of trpL RNA.
These results prove that, indeed, termination occurs at the site 20 bases
ahead of the trpE gene and that under normal conditions a majority of
the  transcription  does  not  enter  the  trp  structural  genes.  The  site  at
which termination occurs is called trp a.

Figure 13.10  The  termination
site of trpL RNA.

The obvious and most important question to ask at this point was
whether transcriptional termination, which ordinarily permitted only
one  in  eight  to  ten  polymerases  to  transcribe  into  the  trp  structural
genes, was regulated or whether the efficiency of termination at trp a
was independent of growth conditions. This was tested by starving for
tryptophan and examining the attenuation level. Suitable starvation was
generated  by  the  addition  of  indolylacrylic  acid  that  inhibits  both
tryptophan synthesis and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. It did decrease
termination, and thus termination at trp a is regulated, and is called
attenuation. Starvation for other amino acids did not decrease termina-
tion at trp a, thereby proving that termination does play a regulatory
role in the trp operon.

In vitro transcription of the trp operon DNA was the logical next step
in these studies. The trp RNA from such experiments could be quanti-
tated by its synthesis from φ80 and λ-trp phage and appropriate RNA-
DNA hybridizations. These showed that virtually all transcripts ended
at  the  point  identified  in  the  in  vivo  experiments  as  responsible  for
termination. The sequence of this region showed that it resembles other
sequences at which RNA transcription terminates (Fig. 13.10). It con-
tains a G-C-rich region that can form a hairpin followed by a string of
eight U’s.

The leader region also contains an AUG codon and can bind ribo-
somes just like the beginning of authentic genes. This was shown by the
straightforward but technically difficult experiment of isolating radio-
active  leader  region  RNA  from  cells,  binding  ribosomes  to  it  in  the
presence of initiation factors and f-met-tRNAfmet, lightly digesting with
RNAse,  and  sequencing  the  RNA  that  was  protected  from  digestion.
Following  the  AUG  codon  are  13  more  codons  before  a  translation
termination codon. Clearly it was of great interest to determine whether
this leader peptide is synthesized in vivo. Vigorous attempts to isolate
it failed, however. Therefore an indirect experiment was used to prove
that the leader is  translated. The leader peptide region was fused by
deletion to the lac repressor gene, and the corresponding fusion protein
was found to be synthesized  at a  high rate. Since  the  leader  peptide
contains two tryptophans, termination efficiency appeared to be cou-

pled to translation. This suspicion was deepened by the findings that trp
regulation is altered in some trp synthetase mutants.

Once the hairpin secondary structure in the RNA immediately preced-
ing the trp attenuation site was associated with transcription termina-
tion, several critical experiments were apparent. One was to examine
the consequences of  changing the sequence  of the region. Mutations
changing the stability of the hairpin might be expected to alter termi-
nation  efficiency.  A  second  and  easier  experiment  was  to  examine
naturally occurring sequence variants. Because related bacterial strains
must have evolved from a common predecessor, they probably share
the same basic mechanism of trp regulation. If the leader sequences of
their trp operons possess structural features in common, these features
are likely to be important in the regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, this
was  found.  The  trp  operon  in  Salmonella  typhimurium  and  Serratia
marcescens also contain leader regions. Both code for a leader peptide
containing several tryptophans, and both mRNAs are capable of form-
ing a hairpin just before a string of U’s located about 20 bases ahead of
the trpE gene.

Close examination of the leader region of the trp operon of E. coli,
the trp operons from other strains of bacteria, and other amino acid
biosynthetic operons has revealed two additional facts. First, the pep-
tides encoded by the leader regions always contain one to seven of the
amino  acid  residues  synthesized  by  that  operon.  Second,  the  leader
mRNAs  possess  at  least  four  regions  that  can  form  intramolecular
base-paired hairpins (Fig. 13.11). Here they are numbered 1, 2, 3, and

4.  The  pairing  of  3  and  4  forms  the  hairpin  discussed  above  that  is
required  for  termination  of  transcription.  Additionally,  region  2  can
base pair either with region 3 or with region 1. Likewise, region 3 can
base pair with region 2 or 4. The particular hybrids that form on a leader
molecule determine whether transcription of that molecule will termi-
nate as RNA polymerase passes the attenuation region. As we will see,
the  pairing  choice  is  regulated  by  the  position  on  the  leader  of  a
ribosome translating the leader peptide.

Coupling Translation to Termination

The  location  of  the  leader  peptide  with  respect  to  the  four  different
regions capable of hybrid formation in the trp leader region provides a
simple mechanism for regulating termination. If the 3-4 hybrid forms
during transcription of this region, termination is possible because this
hybrid is  the  “termination” loop.  Conversely, if the 2-3 hybrid forms
during transcription of leader, then formation of the “termination” loop
is  prevented.  Finally,  if  the  1-2  hybrid  forms,  then  region  2  is  not
available  for  formation  of  the  2-3  hybrid,  but  as  RNA  polymerase
transcribes regions 3 and 4, they are free to base pair, and transcription
terminates.

How can the presence or absence of tryptophan affect formation of
the 1-2 or 2-3 hybrid? Ribosomes translating the leader region in the
absence of charged tRNAs will stall at the trp codons and, owing to their
location, they will block the formation of the 1-2 hybrid (Fig. 13.12).
Formation of the 2-3 hybrid is not blocked, and as soon as these regions
of the mRNA are synthesized, this hybrid forms. Consequently, the 3-4
hybrid does not form in time to terminate transcription, and termina-
tion does not occur.

In the absence of any protein synthesis, ribosomes cannot bind to the
leader region, and the 1-2 hybrid forms. In turn, this permits formation
of  the  3-4  hybrid.  Termination  follows.  This  happens  in  an  in  vitro

transcription system, which, as we saw above, terminates transcription
with a high probability at the attenuation site.

Finally, what happens in the presence of excess tryptophan? In cells
containing  adequate levels of tryptophan, much initiation, of course,
will be blocked by the trp repressor. The transcription that is initiated
however,  will  be  largely  terminated,  for  ribosomes  either  complete
translation of the leader peptide and permit hybrids 1-2 and 3-4 to form,
or ribosomes remain awhile at the termination codon. From this posi-
tion  they  block  formation  of  the  1-2  hybrid.  In  either  case,  the  3-4
hybrids form, and termination at the attenuator occurs.

It is necessary to note that the relative thermodynamic stability of the
various  leader  hybrids  is  not  important  to  attenuation.  The  factor
determining whether termination will occur is which structures are not
blocked  from  forming.  The  kinetics  of  formation  of  the  base-paired
structures should be on time scales less than milliseconds so that if they
are not blocked from forming, they should form while the RNA is being
synthesized.  Then several  seconds  after  initiating transcription,  RNA
polymerase reaches the attenuation site and terminates or not depend-
ing on whether or not the 3-4 hybrid has formed. The interval between
initiation  and  termination  is  much  shorter  than  the  interconversion
time of many hybrid structures, and they therefore will not necessarily
have had time to adopt their lowest-energy conformation (Table 13.1).
The factor determining termination is which of the hybrid structures
exists at the time RNA polymerase transcribes past the potential termi-
nation site.

How does the system ensure that ribosomes initiate translation as
soon as the leader has been synthesized? If ribosomes do not promptly
initiate translation of the leader, premature termination at the attenu-
ator will result. At the typical rates of ribosome binding to messenger,
transcription could easily extend beyond the termination site before the
first  ribosome  had  a  chance  to  bind  to  messenger  and  affect  loop
formation. The problem of forcing a ribosome onto the mRNA just as
it emerges from the polymerase is solved in a simple way. The trp leader
sequence  possesses  regions  at  which  transcription  is  slowed  due  to
pausing  by polymerase.  Most  likely  these  pauses  result from hairpin
structures in the newly synthesized RNA. The duration of the pauses
could be random, but if the average is long enough, most messengers
could then have a ribosome bind and initiate translation. When polym-
erase resumes transcription, the ribosome following immediately be-
hind is properly situated to regulate attenuation.

RNA Secondary Structure and the Attenuation Mechanism

Point mutations provide excellent support for the attenuation mecha-
nism as outlined above. Changing the AUG codon of the leader to an
AUA has the expected effect (see Problem 13.2). A base change abolish-
ing a base pair in the 2-3 hybrid, but one having no effect on the base
pairs  of  hybrids  1-2  or  3-4 prevents  the  leader  from  forming the 2-3
hybrid.  Consequently,  the  3-4  hybrid  always  forms,  and  termination
inevitably results. Mutations that reduce the stability of the 3-4 hybrid
reduce transcription termination, both in vitro and in vivo.

Direct experiments also provide evidence for the existence of secon-
dary structure in the leader RNA. Light digestion of the RNA with RNAse
T1 cleaves only at those guanosines postulated not to be in the hybrids
(Fig. 13.13). A second experiment also suggests that base pairing in the
leader region is important. As mentioned above, in an in vitro transcrip-
tion system with purified DNA and RNA polymerase, virtually all tran-
scripts are terminated at the attenuation site. The substitution of inosine
triphosphate (ITP) for GTP however, eliminates the premature termi-

nation. While it is possible that specific contacts between the inosine
and RNA polymerase or between the inosine and the DNA are respon-
sible for the lack of termination, it seems more likely that the failure of
the substituted RNA to form its 3-4 hybrid is the reason. Whereas G-C
base pairs possess three hydrogen bonds, I-C base pairs have only two

because inosine lacks an amino group that is present on guanosine. The
two hydrogen bonds do not provide sufficient energy to form the usual
hybrids, and thus termination does not occur. Analogs incorporated into
the  DNA  generate  much  smaller  perturbations  on  termination,  also
suggesting that it is the base-paired structure of the transcribed RNA
that is necessary for termination at the attenuation site. The use of DNA
molecules heteroduplex in the leader region also yields data consistent
with the attenuation mechanism. DNA molecules can be constructed
that are wild-type on one strand and mutant in a single base in the leader
region on the other (Fig. 13.14). Only when the mutation is on the strand
copied  by  RNA  polymerase  and  therefore  producing an altered  RNA
product molecule does the mutant nucleotide alter attenuation. If the
RNA product is wild-type, so is transcription and termination.

Finally, direct physical evidence for the attenuation model has also
been obtained. In an in vitro transcription system, the usual termination
at  the  attenuator  can  be  blocked  by  including  a  large  excess  of  an
oligonucleotide  complementary  to  region  1. Apparently  this  oligonu-
cleotide anneals to region 1 as it is synthesized and prevents its pairing
with region 2. Consequently, the 2-3 hairpin forms, and the 3-4 hairpin,
which is required for termination, cannot form. Therefore, termination
does not occur.

Other Attenuated Systems: Operons, Bacillus subtilis and HIV

Study of the sequences of a number of amino acid biosynthetic operons
has revealed that they are likely to be regulated by attenuation. Their
leader peptides contain dramatic runs of the amino acid whose synthe-
sis  the  operon  codes  for  (Fig.  13.15).  In  summary,  the  attenuation
mechanism seems to be an exceptionally efficient method regulating the
amino acid biosynthetic  operons because the necessary regulation  is

obtained by the properties of just 160 nucleotides of RNA. In the case
of  the  trp  operon,  the double-barreled regulation  provided by  trp  re-
pressor  and  attenuation  provides  up  to  a  700-fold  regulation  range,
70-fold coming from repression and another 10-fold from attenuation.
The  autoregulation  of  trpR  permits  rapid  accumulation  of  optimal
enzyme level in cells on tryptophan starvation followed by a slower rate
of enzyme synthesis when steady-state conditions have been reached.
It is not just amino acid biosynthetic operons that are regulated by
attenuation. The synthesis of aspartic transcarbamoylase is also regu-
lated by such a mechanism. This enzyme ultimately leads to the synthe-
sis of uracil and hence UTP, and therefore we can imagine a coupling
between UTP levels and the speed of transcription in a leader region,
and indeed such has been found.

Escherichia  coli  and a  number of closely related bacteria regulate
their trp operons similarly. In Bacillus subtilis however, a less closely
related bacterium, has evolved a significant variation of the attenuation
mechanism. Introduction of multiple copies of trp operon DNA into B.
subtilis leads to the deregulation of the chromosomal gene copy. This
becomes active whether or not tryptophan is present. One might first
guess that the multiple gene copies merely bind a limited number of
repressor  molecules  so  that  overall,  any  copy  of  the  operon  is
derepressed because on average it is repressed only a small part of the
time.

The actual situation on the trp operon was more interesting than mere
repressor titration. Expressing trp messenger under control of the lac
promoter provided a simple demonstration that it is multiple copies of
trp messenger RNA and not multiple copies of DNA that lead to deregu-
lation. While the lac promoter is repressed and little trp messenger is
present,  the  cellular  trp  promoter  is  regulated  normally.  When  trp
messenger is synthesized at high rates under control of the lac promoter,
the chromosomal trp operon loses regulation and becomes constitutive.
The  simplest  explanation  of  this  finding  is  that  the  trp  RNA  itself

402  Attenuation and the trp Operon

Problems

sequesters  a  molecule  present  in  the  cell  in  limited  amounts.  This
molecule could be required for repression of the trp operon.

Simply by deleting portions of the trp messenger, the region necessary
for titration of the presumed protein could be mapped. Not surprisingly,
it lies  ahead of the trp structural genes. The messenger ahead of  the
genes also has the potential to form multiple hairpin structures. One of
the structures contains the typical transcription termination signal of a
G-C rich hairpin followed by a string of U’s. The alternative structure to
the RNA precludes formation of the termination hairpin. In the presence
of tryptophan the regulatory protein binds to the structure that leads to
termination at the attenuator.

The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 regulates synthesis of its
RNA via an attenuation mechanism. Of course, since the transcription
occurs in the nucleus, it cannot be directly coupled to translation as it
is  for  the  trp  operon.  In  the  absence  of  the  HIV-1  Tat  protein,  RNA
polymerase begins transcription at the HIV promoter, but pauses after
synthesis of about 60 nucleotides. These transcripts usually terminate.
When Tat protein is provided, the transcripts elongate to completion.
Although Tat may interact with the promoter to affect its activity as well,
the primary target of Tat action is the elongating mRNA, and Tat binds
to a site on this RNA called TAR.

13.1. If you wished to gather evidence for the attenuation mechanism
of the trp operon by hybridizing an oligonucleotide to RNA in vitro as it
is being synthesized, what would you attempt?

13.2. What would the effect be of changing the AUG codon of the trp

leader peptide to AUA or of damaging the Shine-Dalgarno sequence?

13.3. If the leader region of the trp operon of the messenger RNA has
signaled the RNA polymerase passing the attenuation region whether
or not it is useful to terminate, it would be sensible for the attentuation
region to no longer be involved in binding ribosomes and synthesizing
a short polypeptide. How could this hypothesis be tested?

13.4. Suppose the enzymes of the trp operon were highly unstable,
that is, had a lifetime of about five minutes. What types of regulation
would then be necessary or unnecessary?

13.5. Pretend the trp repressor is not self-regulating, that is, that it is
synthesized  at  a  low  constant  rate  from  a  weak  promoter.  Invent  a
scheme,  perhaps  requiring  some  genetic  engineering  and  based  on
colony color, which would reveal a clone carrying trp operator.

13.6. What is likely to happen to regulation of the trp operon in a
mutant E. coli in which RNA polymerase elongates at twice the normal
rate?

13.7.  Suppose  E.  coli  were  being  modified  to  permit  maximum
synthesis  of  tryptophan  while  retaining  the  basic  regulatory  mecha-
nism. Suppose also that the signal that has been chosen to induce this

Problems  403

maximal  synthesis  is  starvation  or  semistarvation  for  leucine.  What
cellular modifications would be necessary?

13.8. In view of the rates discussed in earlier chapters, estimate the
average  time  between  initiations  by  ribosomes  on  the  trp  leader  se-
quence. What would be  the effect on  trp attenuation if the ribosome
initiation frequency were limited only by the peptide elongation rate?
13.9. How could an attenuation mechanism be used for regulation of

synthesis of purines or pyrimidines?

13.10. The data presented in this chapter on the TrpB enzyme levels
in the different deletions are anomalous. What is unusual and what is
a likely explanation?

13.11. Considering that a DNA sequence that encodes transcription
termination  contains  a  region  rich  in  G’s  and  C’s  that  can  base  pair
followed by a string of about six U’s, devise several mechanisms that
could use this information to signal the RNA polymerase to terminate
transcription.  For  example,  one  might  be  that  the  separated  DNA
strands at the transcription point themselves form hairpins in addition
to the RNA, and the three hairpins bind to sites within the polymerase
to cause it to terminate.

13.12. Suppose, in the days before definitive experiments could be
performed with purified components, you wished to determine whether
tryptophan, trp-tRNAtrp, or tryptophanyl-tRNA-synthetase was involved
in repression of the trp operon. Invent data you could obtain with crude
extracts or partially purified extracts, perhaps using appropriate mu-
tants or tryptophan analogs, that would prove that tryptophan was the
corepressor of the trp operon.

13.13. In describing the experiments of Yanofsky, no mention was
made in this chapter of testing whether the hypersynthesizing deletions
might  be  the  effect  of  a  diffusible  product  in  the  cells.  Design  an
experiment and invent results that would prove that the hypersynthesis
was a cis effect.

13.14. How do you reconcile the existence of suppressors of polarity
that function on polar mutants in lac and trp with the fact that in vitro
transcription of trp terminates nearly 100% at the attenuator even in the
absence of rho?

13.15. Consider the use of hybridization to quantitate trp leader and
distal  mRNA  resulting  from  in  vitro  transcription.  What  would  the
results look like and what mistaken conclusion would be drawn if the
DNA used for hybridization were not present in molar excess over the
RNA?

13.16.  The  paper,  “Transcription  Termination  at  the  trp  Operon
Attenuators of E. coli and S. typhimurium: RNA Secondary Structure
and Regulation of Termination,” F. Lee, C. Yanofsky, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 75, 4365-4369 (1977), did not present the complete attenuation
model. What critical information was not yet available?

Lambda Phage Genes
and Regulatory Circuitry

Lambda Phage Genes and Regulatory Circuitry

14

As a result of its convenient size and interesting biological properties,
lambda phage has been intensively studied for many years. Lambda is
neither so small that each of its genes must play multiple roles in phage
development  nor  so  large  that  there  are  too  many  genes  to  study  or
understand.  Furthermore,  lambda  has  an  interesting  dual  mode  of
existence. On one hand, a lambda phage can infect a cell, grow vegeta-
tively to produce a hundred copies of itself, and lyse the cell. On the
other hand, a lambda phage can infect a cell and enter a quiescent phase.
In this lysogenic state only three phage genes are expressed, and both
daughters  of  cell  division  by  a  lysogenic  cell  are  similarly  lysogenic.
Although it is highly stable and can be passed for many generations to
descendant cells, lysogeny need not be permanent. The lambda within
a lysogenic cell can be induced to enter its vegetative mode and will then
multiply and lyse the cell.

Lambda raises two fundamental questions. First, how does the virus
regulate  its  growth?  Lytic  growth  itself  requires  regulation  because
genes must be expressed at the right time and to the correct extent to
maximize viable phage yield. A second aspect to lambda’s regulation
problems is lysogeny. The phage existing as a lysogen must keep most
of  its  genes  off  and  switch  them  on  upon  induction.  The  regulation
system  controlling  the  two  states  must  be  reasonably  stable  because
lambda in a lysogenic cell only rarely induces spontaneously to begin
vegetative growth.

The  second  fundamental  question  raised  by  the  existence  of  the
lysogenic state is entering and excising from the chromosome. When
lambda infects a cell and generates a lysogen, its DNA must integrate

409

410  Lambda Phage Genes and Regulatory Circuitry

into  the  host  chromosome.  When  the  integrated lambda induces, its
DNA  is  excised  from  the  chromosome.  How  are  these  steps  accom-
plished?  What  enzymes  and  DNA  substrates  are  required  for  these
reactions?  How  is  the  reaction  forced  to  proceed  in  the  direction  of
integration following infection, and how is it forced to go in the direction
of excision upon phage induction?

The research that has been concentrated on lambda has told us much
about this phage, particularly the research that combined genetic analy-
sis and physiological studies. One unexpected practical result of these
studies was the ability to use lambda as a vector in genetic engineering.
Now most  research  on lambda is  concentrated on  the  more  difficult
questions of how things happen rather than what happens, or where the
genes are, or what the different genes accomplish for the phage. This
chapter explains the structure and scheme of gene regulation in phage
lambda,  and  a  later  chapter  describes  the  integration  and  excision
process of the phage. 

A. The Structure and Biology of Lambda

The Physical Structure of Lambda

The lambda phage that has been studied in the laboratory possesses an
isometric head of diameter 650 Å and a tail 1,500 Å long and 170 Å wide.
A tail fiber extends an additional 200 Å from the tail. This tail fiber makes
a specific contact with a porin protein found in the outer membrane of
the host cell, and the phage DNA is injected through the tail into the cell.
Apparently in an early isolation of lambda, investigators chose a mutant
form of the virus that lacked tail fibers. The natural form possesses a
number of tail fibers that attach the phage to something other than the

porin protein. The DNA within the phage particle is double-stranded
and linear, with a length of 48,502 base pairs. This is roughly 1% the
size of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Intracellularly, lambda DNA
exists  as  monomeric  circles  or  polymeric  circular  forms,  but  during
encapsidation,  unit-length lambda linear genomes  are  cut out  of  the
polymeric forms (Fig. 14.1). The cuts of the two DNA strands are offset
from one another by 12 bases. Thus the ends of the encapsidated phage
DNA are single-stranded and complementary.

Roughly half the mass of a lambda particle is DNA and half is protein.
Consequently, the particle has a density in CsCl halfway between the
density of DNA, 1.7 gm/cm3, and the density of protein, 1.3 gm/cm3. This
density facilitates purification of the phage since isopycnic banding in
CsCl  density  gradients  easily  separates  the  phage  from  most  other
cellular components.

The Genetic Structure of Lambda

A turbid or opaque lawn of cells is formed when 105 or more cells are
spread on the agar surface in a petri plate and allowed to grow until
limited by nutrient availability. If a few of the original cells are infected
with a virus, several cycles of lysis of the infected cells and infection of
adjacent  cells  during  growth  of  the  lawn  leaves  a  clear  hole  in  the
bacterial  lawn.  These  holes  are  called  plaques.  The  first  mutations
isolated  and  mapped  in  phage  lambda  were  those  that  changed  the
morphology  of  its  plaques. Ordinarily,  lambda  plaques  are turbid  or
even contain a minicolony of cells in the plaque center. Both result from
growth of cells that have become immune to lambda infection. Conse-
quently, lambda mutants that do not permit cells to become immune
produce clear plaques. These may easily be identified amid many turbid
plaques.  Kaiser  isolated  and  mapped  such  clear  plaque  mutants  of
lambda. These fell into three complementation groups, which Kaiser
called CI, CII, and CIII, with the C standing for clear.

One particular mutation in the CI gene is especially useful. It is known
as CI857, and the mutant CI product is temperature-sensitive. At tem-
peratures  below  37°  the  phage  forms  normal  turbid  plaques,  but  at
temperatures above 37° the mutant forms clear plaques. Furthermore,
lysogens of lambda CI857 can be induced to switch from lysogenic to
lytic mode by shifting their temperature above 37°. They then excise
from the chromosome and grow vegetatively.

Many  additional  lambda  mutations  were  isolated  and  mapped  by
Campbell.  These  could  be  in  essential  genes,  as  he  used  conditional
mutations. Such mutants are isolated by plating mutagenized phage on
a nonsense-suppressing strain. Plaques deriving from phage containing
nonsense mutations may be identified by their inability to grow after
being spotted onto a nonsuppressing strain.

Phage with nonsense mutations in various genes may then be studied
by first preparing phage stocks of the nonsense mutants on suppressing
hosts. The phage can then be used in a variety of studies. For example,
pairs of mutants can be crossed against one another and the frequency

mutations can be quantitated by plating on nonsuppressing strains. In
this way a genetic map can be constructed. The nonsense mutants also
facilitate study of phage gene function. Nonsuppressing cells infected
with a nonsense mutant phage stock progress only partway through an
infective cycle. The step of phage development and maturation that is
blocked by the mutation can be determined with radioactive isotopes to
quantitate protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis, or electron microscopy to
determine which phage macromolecules or structures are synthesized.

letter names, and by other symbols.

The sequence of the entire lambda DNA molecule has been deter-
mined. A few of the known genes could be identified in the sequence by
the  amino  acid  sequences  of  their  products  or  by  mutations  that
changed the DNA sequence. Many others could be identified with a high
degree of confidence by the correspondence between genetic and physi-
cal  map location (Fig. 14.2). The identification of such open reading
frames was greatly assisted by examination of codon usage. An open

Lysogeny and Immunity  413

reading  frame  that  is  not  translated into protein usually  contains all
sense codons at about the same frequency, whereas the reading frames
that are translated into protein tend to use a subset of the codons. That
is,  many  proteins  use  certain codons with a substantially  higher fre-
quency than other codons. Unexpectedly, applying these criteria to the
DNA sequence of phage lambda revealed more than ten possible genes
not previously identified genetically or biochemically. It remains to be
shown  how  many  of  these  actually  play  a  role  in  phage  growth  and
development.

The DNA sequencing revealed a second unexpected property of the
lambda  genes.  Many  are  partially  overlapped.  The  function  of  this
overlap could be to conserve coding material, although it may also play

a  role  in  translation.  Since  ribosomes  drift  phaselessly  forward  and
backward after encountering a nonsense codon and before dissociating
from  the  mRNA,  this  overlapping  may  help  adjust  the  translation
efficiency of the downstream gene product.

Genes of related function are clustered in the lambda genome. The
genes A through F are required for head formation, and Z through J for
tail formation. The genes in the b2 region are not essential for phage
growth under normal laboratory conditions and may be deleted without
material  effect.  Since  such  deletion  phage  still  possess  the  normal
protein coat but lack about 10% of their DNA, they are less dense than
the wild-type phage; that is, they are buoyant density mutants. The genes
int  and  xis  code  for  proteins  that  are  involved  with  integration  and
excision and will be discussed in a later chapter. The genes exo, β, and
γ are involved with recombination. The proteins from genes CIII, N, CI,
cro, and CII are expressed early in the growth cycle and regulate the
expression of phage genes expressed early. The genes O and P code for
proteins required for initiation of lambda DNA replication. The Q gene
product regulates expression of late genes. These genes include S, R,
and Rz, which are required for lysis of the cell as well as the genes that
encode proteins comprising the head and tail of the phage particle.

Lysogeny and Immunity

When lambda lysogenizes a cell, it inserts its DNA into the DNA of the
host. There, the lambda DNA is passively replicated by the host just as
though it were host DNA. Such a lambda lysogen is highly stable, and
lysogeny can be passed on for hundreds of generations. Upon induction
of the phage, which may be either spontaneous or caused by exposure
to  inducing  agents  such  as  UV  light,  lambda  excises  itself  from  the

414  Lambda Phage Genes and Regulatory Circuitry

chromosome  and  enters  a  lytic  cycle.  About  one  hundred  phage  are
produced, and the cell lyses.

The advantages to the phage and cell of lysogeny would largely be lost
if a lysogenic cell could be lytically infected by another lambda phage.
Indeed, lambda lysogenic cells cannot be lytically infected with more
phage. The cells are said to possess lambda immunity. The superinfect-
ing phage can adsorb to immune cells and inject their DNA into the cell,
but  the  superinfecting  phage  DNA  does  little  else.  This  DNA  is  not
replicated  or  integrated  into  the  host  chromosome  and  therefore  is
diluted away by cell growth since it is passed to only one of the two
daughter cells on cell division.

Lambda repressor protein, the product of the CI gene, confers the
immunity. Repressor encoded by the lysogenic phage diffuses through-
out the cytoplasm of the cell. When another lambda phage injects its
DNA into this cell, the repressor binds to specific sites on the superin-
fecting DNA and inactivates the promoters necessary for the first steps
of vegetative phage growth. This same repressor activity also prevents
the lysogenic phage from initiating its growth. Upon induction of the
lysogen however, the repressor is destroyed and the phage can begin a
lytic growth cycle.

Lambda’s Relatives and Lambda Hybrids

Lambda does not uniquely occupy its ecological niche. A variety of both
close and distant relatives of lambda are known. The near relatives all
possess the same sticky ends of the chromosome and are of almost the
same  size  and  genetic  structure  as  lambda.  Some  possess  the  same
immunity as lambda, which means that they cannot grow in lambda
lysogens,  but  others  possess  different  immunities  and  can  grow  in
lambda lysogens (Table 14.1). That is, they are heteroimmune. Remark-
ably, lambda relatives can form recombinants between one another to
form hybrids. DNA heteroduplexes between them show that their genes
tend to be either closely homologous or quite dissimilar. It is as though
nature possesses a few fundamental lambda-type phage and can inter-
change their parts to produce the large number of different lambdoid
phage that are observed.

A study of the similarities and differences between lambda’s relatives
has been fruitful in understanding lambda. Phage 21, φ80, and 434 have
been particularly useful in the research on phage lambda. They have
highlighted the crucial invariants of lambdoid growth and regulation.
Recombinant hybrids have also been constructed between lambda and
both 21 and 434 (Fig. 14.3). These were constructed so as to retain the
immunity of the heteroimmune phage but to contain as much of the
rest of lambda as possible. These lambda hybrids are called λimm434, or
λi434, and λi21. They permit recombination and complementation stud-
ies  that  otherwise  would  be  impossible  because  of  the  existence  of
immunity.

B. Chronology of a Lytic Infective Cycle

Lambda Adsorption to Cells

Phage particles ought not to inject their DNA wantonly into anything.
For the highest survival value, they should release their encapsidated
DNA only after they have made stable contact with a suitable host cell.
Not unexpectedly, then, lambdoid phage make specific contacts with
structures on the outer surface of E. coli. Only when the proper receptor
is present can the phage adsorb and inject.

Many different membrane structures are used by different phage in
the adsorption and injection process. The laboratory form of lambda
that has been studied for the last two decades uses a protein specified
by the maltose operon. It is named the LamB protein because its first
known function was lambda adsorption and only later was it discovered
to be part of the maltose operon. The normal cellular function of the
LamB protein is to create a pore through the outer membrane somewhat
larger than the pores usually found there. This maltose-inducible pore
is necessary for the diffusion of maltodextrins, to the periplasmic space.
The pore is also necessary if maltose is present at low concentrations.
Induction of the maltose operon increases the levels of this protein and
speeds the adsorption process; eliminating synthesis of this protein or
mutationally altering it makes cells resistant to lambda and can leave
them Mal-.

416  Lambda Phage Genes and Regulatory Circuitry

Early Transcription of Genes N and Cro

Within a minute after injection into the host, the complementary ends
of the lambda DNA anneal to each other and are covalently joined by
the DNA ligase of the host. Supercoiling of the circle by DNA gyrase is
then possible, and the DNA rapidly acquires the superhelical density
necessary for maximum activity of the phage early promoters pL and pR.
These are located on either side of CI.

pL

Cl

Rp

As on all promoters, initiation of transcription from the promoters
pL and pR is followed by the dissociation of the sigma subunit of RNA
polymerase after the polynucleotide chains have reached a length of 6
to 15 nucleotides. Then a host protein, the NusA product, binds to RNA
polymerase. Nus stands for N utilization substance. Most likely it binds
in the site previously occupied by the sigma subunit because only one
or the other of these proteins can bind to RNA polymerase at once.

The RNA polymerase molecules elongate past the point where the
sigma and NusA subunits exchange and they transcribe through the N

polymerase pauses, assisted by the NusA protein, and the host transcrip-
tion terminator, rho, releases the RNA chain and RNA polymerase from
the DNA (Fig. 14.4). This pausing and termination occurs at the first
transcription  termination  sites in the  pL  and  pR  operons,  tL1  and  tR1.
Additional terminators with slightly different properties, tL2 and tR2, lie
farther downstream in both operons. As a result of  tL1 and tR1, the first
stage of lambda vegetative growth is confined to the accumulation of N
and Cro proteins.

N Protein and Antitermination of Early Gene Transcription

Several  minutes  after  infection,  N  protein  reaches  sufficiently  high
concentrations in the cytoplasm to function. It binds to RNA polymerase
and to a special sequence in the mRNA whose corresponding sequence
in the DNA is called the nut, for N utilization, site. Without a functional
nut  sequence,  or  without  the  NusA  protein  already  bound  to  RNA
polymerase,  the  N  protein  does  not  bind  to  the  polymerase.  RNA
polymerase with N protein bound to it no longer terminates transcrip-
tion at the sites tL1 and tR1 and instead continues across these sites to
synthesize messenger for genes CII and CIII as well as the more distal
genes in these operons (Fig. 14.5).

It should be mentioned at this time that a number of E. coli mutants
exist in which wild-type lambda does not grow. Some of these behave
as though the lambda possessed a mutation in the N protein. These are
called nus mutants, and the NusA protein is the product of one such
gene. Presumably, NusA protein can be altered so that it still fulfills its
normal  cellular  function,  but  lambda  N  protein  does  not  properly
interact with it. Consequently, termination always occurs at tL1 and tR1
in nus mutants. Other nus mutations, nusB, nusE, and nusG, lie in RNA
polymerase and in ribosomal genes. These other proteins stabilize the
N protein-RNA polymerase interaction.

The Role of Cro Protein

Once  lambda  has  started  down  the  lytic  pathway  of  development,  it
should not waver in its efforts to maximize efficiency. The three regu-
latory genes we discussed earlier, CI, CII, and CIII all act to turn off
genes used in the lytic cycle. Their presence would be deleterious to lytic
growth. Not surprisingly, then, the phage makes a protein to turn down
excessive synthesis of these three proteins. It is called the Cro protein,
for  control  of  repressor  synthesis.  First,  Cro  binds  to  an  operator
adjacent to the promoter for the maintenance synthesis of CI repressor
in lysogens,  pRM  (Fig. 14.6). Thus, no CI is made via this route. Later,
when  Cro  reaches  higher  concentrations,  it  binds  to  the  operators
adjacent to pL and pR and represses transcription from them as well.
This secondary effect reduces the synthesis of the phage CII and CIII
proteins.

Initiating DNA Synthesis with the O and P Proteins

Transcription originating from pR leads to the accumulation of the O
and P proteins. These, plus transcription into or near the ori site, initiate
a cascade of assembly and disassembly whose function is to denature
the origin region. Denatured origin is the target of DNA primase and its
availability permits replication to begin.

When the O protein has reached appropriate levels, it binds to a series
of four repeats of a palindromic DNA sequence located at ori (Fig. 14.7).
After the O protein has bound, the P protein with bound host protein
DnaB binds to O protein. The host chaperonin proteins DnaJ and DnaK,
that  were  mentioned  earlier  for  their  roles  in  renaturing  denatured
proteins, release P protein and the helicase activity of DnaB plus torsion
on  the  DNA  generated  by  transcription  nearby  helps  separate  the
strands at the origin. With the additional assistance of the host proteins,
DnaE, DnaG, DnaZ, RNA polymerase, and DNA gyrase, DNA synthesis
initiates and proceeds outward in both directions from ori. Ordinarily

the requirement for transcriptional activation of ori is met by transcrip-
tion originating from pR. Other lambda mutants may be isolated that
create other promoters that activated ori. Their transcription does not
have to cross ori. One mutant promoter that activates lambda phage
DNA replication was 95 base pairs away, and its transcription is directed
away from ori.

Curiously, ori is located within the lambda O gene itself! The coding
regions of the O gene on either side of ori specify well-defined domains.
The amino acids encoded by the portion of O containing ori–the four
repeats,  an  A-T-rich  region,  and  a  palindrome–are  not  predicted  to
possess much secondary structure and are very sensitive to proteases.
Such  a  picture  is  consistent  with  the  experimental  findings  that  the
N-terminal portion of the O protein contains the phage-specific DNA
determinants and that the carboxy-terminus of O binds the lambda P
protein. The O protein itself is highly unstable in vivo.

Mutations in the ori site itself support the structure described above.
Ori mutants are recognized because they are cis-dominant mutations
affecting  DNA  replication  and  they  generate  very  tiny  plaques.  The
sequence of several such mutations has shown that they lie in the ori
section of O. Some are small deletions within the ori region, but they all
preserve the reading frame; that is, they are multiples of three bases.
Therefore, the amino acids encoded by the ori portion of the O gene are
unimportant to the functioning of O protein.

shuts off the host recombination pathway, and the Exo and β proteins
open a new pathway for genetic recombination.

Turning off the host recombination pathway is essential to the phage.
As mentioned above, lambda DNA is first replicated bidirectionally from
the ori region. Later in its growth cycle, however, lambda’s replication
shifts to a rolling circle mode. This generates the oligomers of lambda
DNA that are obligatory for encapsidation. Few, if any, rolling circles
survive in the presence of active host RecBCD enzyme. Apparently this
enzyme binds at the free end of DNA in a rolling circle and moves toward
the  circle.  To  prevent  the  cell  from  inactivating  the  rolling  circles,
lambda  inactivates  RecBCD  with  a  protein  of  its  own,  γ  (Fig.  14.8).
Lambda still has need for recombination, and it therefore potentiates
another pathway for genetic recombination by synthesizing the Exo and
β proteins.

Q Protein and Late Protein Synthesis

The final genes in the early operons are the int and xis genes on the left
and the Q gene on the right. The int and xis genes are important in the
lysogenization  process  and  are  discussed  in  a  later  chapter.  The  Q
protein functions as an antiterminator of a promoter located immedi-
ately to its right. Without Q protein, polymerase initiates at this pro-
moter  and  terminates  190  bases  later  (Fig.  14.9).  When  Q  protein  is

present, this termination is abolished, and transcription proceeds across
the S and R genes, across the ligated sticky ends, and into the remaining
late genes. These code for the head and tail structures of the phage. Since
transcription of the late genes occurs at a time when about 40 copies of
the DNA exist in the cell, large quantities of late mRNA are synthesized.

One problem the phage must solve is lysing the cells at the right moment.
Most  likely  this  time  is  a  compromise,  worked  out  over  the  eons,
between maximizing the number of completed phage particles released
and  minimizing  the  interval  after  infection  or  induction  until  some
completed phage are released. Although infection can begin by slipping
lambda’s DNA molecule into the cell through a small hole, the release
of newly assembled phage particles requires something more drastic. At
the least, holes large enough for the phage head must be punched in the
rigid peptidoglycan layer, and the inner and outer membranes must be
ruptured as well.

Three lambda proteins are known to participate in the lysis process.
They  are  all  late  proteins  synthesized  under  control  of  the  Q  gene
product. The first to be identified is the product of the lambda R gene.
Originally this was called the lysozyme for its ability to lyse cells, then
for a while it was mistakenly called an endopeptidase or endolysin for
the  specific  bonds  in  the  peptidoglycan  the  enzyme  was  thought  to
cleave, and now it is correctly known to be a transglycosylase (Fig. 14.10)
that cleaves between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.
Another lambda-encoded protein also degrades the peptidoglycan layer
of the cell. It is the product of the RZ gene, and it is an endopeptidase.
The  third  protein  required  for  lysis  is  the  product  of  the  S  gene.
Experiments indicate that this protein forms a pore through the inner
membrane  so  that  the  R  and  RZ  products,  which  are  cytoplasmic
proteins, are provided access to their peptidoglycan substrate.

The behavior of cells infected with S- phage is consistent with the idea
that the S gene codes for a pore. As expected, the R and RZ products
accumulate  in  the  cytoplasm  of  such  cells,  and  lysis  does  not  occur
unless the inner membrane is damaged. Chloroform treatment or freez-
ing and thawing are two methods for disrupting the integrity of the inner
membrane in S- mutants. Protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and respi-
ration do not shut off in cells infected with S- phage as they normally
do  40  minutes  after  infection  with  S+  phage.  The  shutoff  of  macro-
molecular  synthesis  that  normally  occurs  40  minutes  after  infection
results from leakage of crucial intracellular components, as at this time
the cell loses its ability to concentrate small molecules intracellularly.
S- mutants facilitate work with lambda. First, since macromolecular
synthesis does not shut off at 40 minutes, phage continue to be made
and the phage yield per infected or induced cell is raised from about 100
to  about  500.  Second,  phage  may  easily  be  harvested  from  the  cell
growth medium by centrifuging cells full of phage into pellets, resus-
pending in small volumes, and lysing by the addition of chloroform. As
a  result,  large  quantities  of highly  concentrated  phage  are easily  ob-
tained.

C. The Lysogenic Infective Cycle and Induction of Lysogens

Chronology of Becoming a Lysogen

We now examine how an infecting lambda phage eventually shuts down
gene activity of all but three of its genes when it lysogenizes a cell. The
beginning steps are the same as in a lytic infection: DNA is injected into
the cell, and the N and Cro proteins, which are sometimes called the
immediate early genes, begin to accumulate. Then the remainder of the
proteins synthesized under control of the pL and pR promoters, including
CII and CIII, begin to be synthesized. These latter proteins are crucial
to the lysogenic response in three ways. First, they are necessary for the
initial synthesis of CI; second, they are necessary for adequate synthesis
of the phage protein required for integration of phage DNA into the host
DNA, the Int protein; and third, they delay or reduce the expression of
the Q protein that turns on late protein synthesis.

The CII protein activates transcription from three phage promoters
pRE, pI, and pAQ. The CIII protein works with CII somehow to protect
CII from the action of proteases within the cell. The sensitivity of CII to
proteases and the protection provided by CIII generate a response highly

sensitive to the physiological state of the cell. It is this response that
determines  whether  or  not  a  cell  will  proceed  down  the  lytic  or  the
lysogenic developmental pathways. The promoter pRE is located to the
right of cro and is oriented in the direction opposite to  pR. Thus the
initial part of the RNA synthesized under control of this promoter is
anti-cro  messenger  and  likely  reduces  Cro  protein  synthesis.  The  re-
mainder of the messenger encodes repressor protein, the CI gene prod-
uct, as well as two other proteins in this operon, RexA and RexB. The
pI promoter lies partly in the xis gene and is just in front of the int gene.
The  pAQ  promoter  is  located  within  the  Q  gene  and  oriented  in  the
opposite  direction.  Thus,  the  pAQ  promoter  specifies  the  synthesis  of
antimessenger that reduces Q protein synthesis until CII is gone.

In infected cells that will become lysogens, repressor soon reaches a
level  sufficient  to  bind  to  the  operators  that  overlap  pL  and  pR.  This
binding shuts off synthesis of N, Cro, and the other early gene products.
Hence, although a little Exo, P, γ, O, P, and Q have accumulated, their
levels are insufficient to sustain growth. Lambda destined to become a
lysogen may even undergo several rounds of DNA replication, but then
the early  genes  are  shut  off  and the instability  of  O prevents further
development. The Int protein, which also has been synthesized at high
rates under control of pI, participates with a number of host proteins in
the integration of one copy of the lambda DNA into the host.

After  high  levels  of  lambda  repressor  have  effectively  shut  off  the
phage early promoters, four phage promoters can still produce func-
tional messenger, pRM, pRE, pI, and pAQ. However as CII and CIII lose
activity and are diluted away with cell growth, pRE, pI, and pAQ shut down
and leave only the promoter for the maintenance of repressor synthesis,
pRM, active. The program of shut-down occurs whether or not lambda
has been successful in integrating itself into the host chromosome. If
integration has occurred, then the lambda DNA is replicated by the host
machinery upon each synthesis cycle and each daughter cell inherits a
copy  of  the  lambda  genome  and  is  lysogenic.  If  integration  has  not
occurred,  then  lambda  is  passed  to  only  one  daughter  and  soon  is
effectively lost by dilution.

Site for Cro Repression and CI Activation

Regulation of the early promoters is more complicated than has been
indicated. At both pL and pR are three binding sites for both Cro and
repressor, OL1, OL2, and OL3 on the left, and OR1, OR2, and OR3 on the
right. Repressor bound at OL1 is sufficient to inactivate pL. Repressor

and  Cro  binding  on  the  right  is  more  interesting  and  complicated
because there these proteins regulate the activities of both pR and pRM.

Repressor binding to the operators on the right acts as a repressor for
pR and a stimulator or, at higher concentrations, as a repressor for pRM
(Table 14.2). These different activities are accomplished by the follow-
ing means. Repressor bound at OR1 inactivates pR, but repressor bound
at OR1 and OR2 simultaneously represses pR and activates pRM. Repressor
bound at OR3 inactivates pRM. Cro protein bound at OR3 represses pRM,
and Cro bound to OR1 or OR2 represses pR (Table 14.3).

Despite  the fact  that  Cro and  repressor  bind  to virtually the same
sequences, at least as assayed by DNAse protection and the behavior of
mutations lying in the three operator sites on the right, their binding is
not the  same.  As the level of Cro  begins to  rise in  cells, for  example
during a lytic infective cycle, Cro binds first to OR3 and shuts off the
synthesis of CI repressor. Only later, after the level of Cro has risen still
higher, does it bind to OR2 and OR1 and shut down the activity of pR. On
the other hand, during a phage developmental cycle that will result in
the production of a lysogen, as repressor begins to accumulate it first
binds to OR1 and OR2 and shuts off pR and turns on pRM. At still higher
concentrations, repressor binds to OR3 and shuts off pRM. The basis for
the differential affinity of repressor and Cro for the three operators lies
in  the slight sequence differences among the sites and the structural

differences in the proteins. Repressor and Cro “read” the sequences with
different emphasis on different bases.

We owe the preceding picture to a series of clever in vivo and in vitro
experiments by Ptashne and his collaborators. Two operations had to
be performed to examine the in vivo effects of Cro and repressor on the
activities of pR  and pRM. The synthesis of the  two proteins had to be
decoupled  and  a  means  had  to  be  found  of  varying  the  level  of  one
protein while examining the activity of each of the promoters. Genetic
engineering came to the rescue. In one case Cro protein synthesis was
placed under control of the lac promoter via a plac-cro fusion (Fig. 14.11).
Since the lac promoter was still regulated by lac repressor, the level of
Cro in cells could be varied by varying the concentration of lac inducer,
IPTG, added to the culture medium. Quantitating the activities of pR
and pRM was facilitated by fusing either promoter to the β-galactosidase
gene. Hence, although IPTG was added to cells and β-galactosidase was
measured, the results elucidated behavior not of the lac operon, but of
lambda phage.

As the intracellular concentration of Cro was increased, first pRM and
then  pR  was  repressed  (Fig.  14.12).  These  promoters  showed  much

was shut off and pRM was turned on. Then, at higher concentrations, pRM
was  shut  off  as  well.  In  vitro  transcription  experiments  using  DNA
fragments several hundred base pairs long yielded the same results.

Quantitation of the binding of Cro and repressor to the three opera-
tors was done with DNAse footprinting. At the lowest Cro concentra-
tions, only OR3 is occupied, but as Cro levels are increased, OR2 and OR1
become occupied as well. The results with repressor are the reverse. OR1
has the highest apparent affinity for repressor, being 50% occupied at
a concentration of 3 nM in vitro. At twice this concentration, OR2 is 50%
occupied, but 25 times this concentration is required for OR3 to be 50%
occupied.

Cooperativity in Repressor Binding and its Measurement

As seen  in the preceding section, repressor does not bind with equal
affinity to the three operators on the right. More detailed experiments
also reveal that repressor molecules do not bind independently to the

three operators (Table 14.4). Not surprisingly, repressors bound at the
operators  interact  with  one  another  and  change  the  overall  binding
energy of repressor for an operator. Most unexpectedly, however, the
results show that a repressor molecule bound at the middle operator
can interact either with a repressor bound at OR1 or with a repressor
bound at OR3, but it does not simultaneously interact with both. This is
termed a pairwise interaction.

Operator  mutants  were  used  to  measure  the  intrinsic  affinity  of
repressor for the three operator sites as well as to reveal interactions
between  adjacently  bound  repressor  molecules.  By  eliminating  re-
pressor binding to OR2, the binding energy of repressor to OR1 and to
OR3 could be measured without complications caused by interactions
with adjacent repressors. Similarly, eliminating binding at OR1 or OR3
permitted determination of the other binding energies. Ultimately, this
series of measurements provided enough data to permit calculation of
the interaction energies of adjacent repressor molecules. The measure-
ments showed that repressor binding at OR2 has a dramatic effect on
the binding of adjacent repressors.

The Need for and the Realization of  Hair-Trigger Induction

Why does lambda possess regulation systems as complicated as those
described above? Part of the answer is that lambda must switch between
two  states,  lytic  and  lysogenic.  Even  so,  this  does  not  explain why  a
simple repressor like that found in the lac operon could not suffice for
lambda’s needs. In part the answer lies in the fact that lambda must
regulate its gene activities over a much greater range than lac. The basal
level of the lac operon is 0.1% of the fully induced level, and there is no
apparent reason why a lower basal level would serve any useful purpose.
A  similar  basal  level  of  repression  of  lambda  early  genes  would  be
disastrous,  for  lambda  would  then  have  a  high  rate  of  spontaneous
induction  from  the  lysogenic  state.  Experimentally  the  spontaneous
induction rate is low. Typically in a doubling time, fewer than one cell
out  of  106  spontaneously  cures  of  lambda  or  induces.  This  low  rate
means that the basal level of expression of the lambda early genes is very
low indeed.

Suppose the basal level of expression of a repressible operon similar
to the lac operon is to be generated by increasing the concentration of
repressor. To reduce the basal level to 1/1000 of normal, the repressor
level would have to be raised 1000-fold. Not only would this be wasteful
of repressor, but even worse are the implications for induction. With
10,000  molecules  of  repressor  per  cell,  inducing  the  early  genes  to
greater than 50% of maximal would require inactivating approximately
of 9,998 repressor molecules per cell. Although lambda phage may like
to  hitch  a  free  ride  in  healthy  cells,  once  viability  of  the  cells  is  in
question  because  of  damage  to  the  host  DNA,  lambda  bails  out  and
induces.  The  lambda  in  very  few  cells  indeed  would  be  capable  of
inducing if 99.995% of the repressor within a cell had to be inactivated
before early genes could be turned on efficiently.

One of lambda’s solutions to the problem of being either repressed
or induced has been to evolve a nonlinear induction response. At the
normal levels of repressor, of about 100 dimers per cell, lambda is fully
repressed. However, if 90% of repressor has been inactivated, the pR
promoter of lambda is 50% of fully induced. For comparison, inactiva-
tion of 90% of lac repressor induces the lac operon only 3% (Table 14.5).
The highly cooperative binding of repressor to OR1 and OR2 is largely
responsible for lambda’s nonlinear response. This can be understood
quantitatively  as  follows.  Since  the  high  cooperativity  in  repressor
binding means that most often OR1 and OR2 are either unoccupied or
simultaneously occupied, it is a good approximation to assume that two
repressors bind to operator at the same time. Combining the binding
equation that defines the dissociation constant with the conservation
equation and solving yields the ratio of free operator O to total operator
OT, that is, the relative amount of derepression as a function of repressor
concentration:

O × R2

O + O⋅R2 = OT

1/2
As the concentration of free repressor falls from a value a bit above KD
1/2, promoter activity, which is proportional to the
to a value below KD
fraction of operator unoccupied by repressor, O/OT, increases rapidly
due to the R2 term. Hence very sharp changes in operator occupancy
can be produced with relatively small changes in the concentration of
repressor (Fig. 14.14).

Lambda repressor uses another mechanism in addition to coopera-
tive binding to the operators to increase the nonlinearity in its response
to repressor concentration. Only dimers of the repressor polypeptide
are able to bind to lambda operators under physiological conditions.

reaction is such that a small reduction from the normal intracellular
concentration of repressor sharply reduces the concentration of active
repressor dimers. The combination of repressor monomer association-
dissociation, cooperativity in repressor binding, and the need for sus-
tained synthesis of N protein for lambda induction and development
produces a very nonlinear induction response to changes in repressor
level. At one concentration of repressor, lambda is highly stable as a
lysogen, but at a lower concentration, lambda almost fully derepresses
pL and pR.

Induction from the Lysogenic State

In this section we discuss how lambda escapes from the lysogenic state
and enters a lytic cycle. One time at which this occurs follows host DNA
damage and repair. The signal a phage uses for detection of this damage
is the extensive binding of RecA protein to single-stranded DNA that
accumulates at a replication site when extensive DNA damage is pre-
sent.  Apparently  when  polymerized  along  the  single-stranded  DNA,
RecA is held in a shape that interacts with LexA and lambda repressor.
The interaction stimulates the inherent self-cleavage activity of these
repressors (Fig. 14.15). Once cleaved, these repressors are no longer able
to repress.

In a nonlysogenic cell the genes that are normally repressed by LexA
protein are the lexA gene itself, the recA gene, and a set of about 20 others
that are part of the SOS system. Known functions of this system are to
repair  damaged  DNA  and  to  postpone  cell  division  until  repair  is
completed. Once repair is completed, the single-stranded DNA no longer
available to activate RecA. Consequently, newly synthesized LexA pro-
tein is no longer cleaved and it therefore represses synthesis of RecA
and the other proteins of the SOS system. In a normal nonlysogenic cell,
the SOS system switches off when it is no longer needed.

The proteolytic activity of LexA and CI which is stimulated by RecA
protein  disconnects  the  N-terminal  domain  of  the  lambda  repressor
from the C-terminal domain (Fig. 14.16). A number of physical experi-
ments with protease-digested repressor or with N-terminal fragments
of repressor produced from nonsense mutations have revealed that the
N-terminal half of the protein folds up to form a compact domain that
can  bind  to  operator.  The  C-terminus  also  folds  to  form  a  compact
domain, but this domain is primarily responsible for the dimerization
of repressor. The C-terminal domains lacking N-terminal domain still
dimerize, whereas the N-terminal fragments do not.

Figure 14.17  The  activation  of  RNA  polymerase  at  pRM  by  two  repressor
dimers bound at OR1 and OR2.

As required for induction, the affinity of the monomeric N-terminal
domain  for  operator  is  much  lower  than  that  of  the  intact  dimeric
repressor. Furthermore, the N-terminal domains do  not show strong
cooperativity in their binding to adjacent operators. In the next section
we  will  see  why  the  proteolytic  cleavage  and  elimination  of  dimeric
DNA-binding domains greatly reduce the affinity of repressor for opera-
tor. As a result of this reduced affinity, repressor comes off the DNA and
the phage induces.

The N-terminal domain of repressor makes protein-protein contacts
with RNA polymerase when  it  stimulates  transcription  from the pRM
promoter (Fig. 14.17). The stimulation provided by this positive-acting
factor  is  similar  to  the  stimulation  provided  by  CRP  protein.  The
repressor accelerates the isomerization rate by RNA polymerase after it
has  bound  to  pRM.  CRP  bound  near  position  -41  on  promoters  also
stimulates isomerization.

Two types of evidence indicate that it is the N-terminal domain of
repressor that contacts RNA polymerase. The first is the existence of
mutations in lambda repressor that eliminate the positive stimulation
of  pRM  by  repressor  when  it  occupies  OR1  and  OR2.  These  lie  in  the
portion of the protein immediately adjacent to the helices of the N-ter-
minal domain that contact operator. The second is that high levels of
the N-terminal domain are capable of stimulating pRM.

Entropy, a Basis for Lambda Repressor Inactivation

The  binding  of  dimeric  repressor  to  operator  can  be  described  by  a
dissociation constant that is related to the change in the free energy via
the standard thermodynamic relationship:

KD  =  e− 

=  e− 

  ∆G
RT
  (∆H  −  T∆S)

RT

 

,

where KD is the dissociation constant of the dimer from operator, ∆G is
the change in free energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature,
∆S is the change in entropy, and ∆H is the change in enthalpy.

It is natural to assume that if monomeric repressor were binding to
operator, then roughly half as many contacts would be formed between

432  Lambda Phage Genes and Regulatory Circuitry

repressor and DNA and roughly half as many water molecules and ions
would be displaced from DNA and the protein as the repressor bound.
Therefore we might write for the dissociation constant of the monomer
where KM is the dissociation constant for monomer,

KM  =  e− 

[ ∆H  −  T∆S]

2 RT

 1/2. This is not correct, however. To make this clear, let ∆S
or KM = KD
be written as the sum of the entropy changes involved with the contacts
and displacement of water, ∆Sinteraction dimer  plus the change in entropy
involved with immobilization and orientation of the dimeric repressor,
∆Sintrinsic dimer:

 ∆Sdimer = ∆Sinteraction dimer + ∆Sintrinsic dimer.

The same type of equation can be written for the monomer:

  ∆Smonomer= ∆Sinteraction monomer + ∆Sintrinsic monomer.

Roughly the monomer makes half as many interactions as the dimer
and  displaces  half  as  many  water  molecules  and  ions  as  it  binds.
Therefore

∆Sinteraction monomer = ∆Sinteraction dimer/2.

The  same  is  not  true  of  the  intrinsic  entropies.  The  entropy  change
associated  with  bringing  repressor  monomer  to  rest  on  operator  by
correctly positioning and orienting it is nearly the same as the change
associated with the dimeric repressor. Thus

 ∆Smonomer ≠ ∆Sdimer/2,

Figure 14.18    Why a  dimer  can  bind much  more tightly than a  momomer.
Almost all the additional ∆H provided by the second monomer’s binding can go
into increasing ∆G, whereas for binding of a monomer, almost no ∆G is left over
to contribute to binding.

Problems  433

and detailed calculations based on statistical mechanics or experiments
show that the inequality can be severe. This is another example of the
chelate effect discussed earlier. In other words, a sizable fraction of the
total entropy change involved with repressor binding to DNA is associ-
ated with its correct positioning. Roughly the same entropy is required
to orient a monomer or dimer, but in the case of lambda repressor, the
presence of the second subunit of the dimer adds twice as much to the
binding energy. Most of this additional energy can go into holding the
dimer on the DNA, and hence KD is much less than KM

14.6.  What  would  you  do  to  make  a  bacterial  strain  that  would
maximize  the  frequency  of  lysogenization  upon  infection  by  phage
lambda? 

14.7.  How  could  one  show  genetically  that  v1v3,  a  double-point

sion? Similarly, how could one show genetically that v2, a mutation in
the leftward operators, makes pL repressor insensitive?

14.8.  C17 is a repressor-insensitive new promoter for genes CII, O,

14.10. The lambda R gene product was once identified as an endopep-
tidase in “Endopeptidase Activity of phage Lambda-Endolysin,” Nature
New Biol. 234, 144-145 (1971). What is a likely reason for the misiden-
tification and what control experiments would you have performed?

14.11.  A  lysogen  of  lambda  CI857N-O-P-  is  grown  at  42°  for  many

manner  with  lambda  yielded  clear  plaques  and  a  lysogenization  fre-
quency much lower than seen on infection of a similarly treated non-
lysogenic strain. Why?

14.12. Simultaneous infection of a lambda lysogen with λ and λi434
produced a burst containing only λi434. Why? How would you isolate
lambda mutants that would grow in a lambda lysogen when coinfected
with λi434, and where would you expect these to map?

14.13. Write a few insightful comments about the locations of genes

and their sites of action in phage lambda.

14.14. A culture of a lambda lysogen was mutagenized, grown ten
doublings,  and  plated  out.  Why  is  it  at  first  paradoxical  that  some
plaques should be clear, and what is the explanation? 

14.15.  Conceivably  a  nus  mutation  might  act  by  causing  a  host
protein to inactivate the N protein of phage lambda. Although a com-
plicated biochemical experiment could be used to test this idea, what
simple genetic experiment could disprove the proposal?

14.16. Devise a selection or scoring method for the isolation of CI

mutations that repress normally but do not stimulate pRM.

14.17. If the LamB porin possesses larger holes than the two porins

specificities. Based on this, what do you predict about the mechanism
of Q action?

14.24. Suppose someone has made a variant lambda phage in which
the coding regions for repressor and cro protein are interchanged. Your
objective is to try to make lystates and lysogens of this phage. How could
you  do  it?  For  example,  you  might  infect    cells  full  of  CII  and  CIII
protein. If it is not possible, what is the reason?

Xenopus 5S RNA Synthesis

The  cells  resulting  from  successive  divisions  of  a  fertilized  egg  cell
ultimately become specialized for different functions. How do they do
this?  The  answer  is  equivalent  to  understanding  regulation  of  the
relevant  genes. The genes involved  in growth and development  must
respond to internal signals generated by the organism as it develops.
This  is  in  contrast  to  the  externally  generated  and  easily  controlled
signals that regulate the activities of many of the gene systems discussed
up  to  this  point.  Important  developmental  biology  questions  revolve
around the signals: how they are timed, how they set up spatial patterns,
and  how  they  regulate  expression  of  the  appropriate  genes.  In  this
chapter we shall be concerned with a relatively simple developmental
problem:  ribosomal  5S  RNA  synthesis,  but  in  a  relatively  complex
organism,  the  South  African  clawed  toad  Xenopus.  Later  we  shall
consider pattern development and the regulation of genes in the fruit
fly Drosophila.

Biology of 5S RNA Synthesis in Xenopus

Oocytes develop in the ovaries of female frogs in a development process
that takes from three months to several years. Eventually the oocytes
mature  as  eggs  ready  to  be  fertilized.  These  huge cells contain  large
amounts of nutrients and protein synthesis machinery so that later, the
fertilized egg can undergo many cell divisions without significant intake
of nutrients and without additional ribosome synthesis.

Curiously,  during  oogenesis components of the ribosomes are  not
synthesized  in  parallel.  In  the  ovaries  the  5S  RNA  components  of
ribosomes  are  synthesized  first,  for  about  two  months.  As  they  are
synthesized, they are stored away in two types of RNA-protein particles.

Origin

Genes to 
be amplified

Figure 15.1  Two rounds of initia-
tion from an origin can yield four
copies  of  genes  immediately  sur-
rounding that origin.

These are known as 7S and 42S particles from their rates of sedimenta-
tion in centrifugation. Even though 5S RNA synthesis proceeds for a
long time, the enormous number of RNA molecules needed in an egg
necessitates that multiple genes encode the RNA. The  Xenopus genome
contains about 100,000 copies of the 5S gene. A special RNA polymerase
transcribes these genes as well as genes coding for tRNAs. This is RNA
polymerase III. Although it is different from the two other cellular RNA
polymerases, it shares a number of subunits in common with them.

After synthesis of the 5S RNA, synthesis of the 18S, 28S, and 5.8S
ribosomal RNAs and the ribosomal proteins begins. We might expect
the  frog  genome  also  to  contain  around  100,000  copies  of  the  genes
coding  for  18S,  28S  and  5.8S  ribosomal  RNAs.  It  doesn’t,  however.
Apparently  the  load  of  carrying  large numbers of  these  much  bigger
genes  would  be  too  great.  Instead,  Xenopus  generates  the  required
number of DNA templates for the other ribosomal RNAs by selective
replication of the 450 ribosomal RNA genes before the ribosomal RNA
is to be synthesized.

Once,  a  key  to  success  in  developmental  biology  was  finding  an
organism or cell-type devoted to the activity you wished to study. In such
cells the specialization in activity reduces the level of other and inter-
fering activities. This simplifies the experimenter’s measurements. Also,
the purification for biochemical study of the components involved is
simpler since they are present in sizeable concentrations in these cells.
For this reason Xenopus permitted careful examination of several im-
portant  developmental  biology  questions  before  the  appearance  of
genetic engineering techniques.

The strategy of selective gene amplification used by Xenopus on its
ribosomal RNA genes is not unique. Other organisms also utilize it for
genes whose products are needed in high level. In terminally differenti-
ated tissues where no further cell division occurs, the gene amplification
can  occur  right  on  the  chromosome  by  the  selective  activity  of  a
replication  origin  (Fig.  15.1).  Since  an  egg  cell,  however,  must  later
divide,  the  mechanism  of  gene  amplification  must  not  irreparably
damage the genome. In Xenopus a copy of the rRNA gene is replicated

free of the chromosome to generate high numbers of templates neces -
sary for the synthesis of the RNA (Fig. 15.2). As the last components of
a ribosome are synthesized, mature ribosomes form. Some begin trans-
lating maternal mRNA while others remain inactive until fertilization
triggers a more vigorous rate of protein synthesis.

Why the genes coding for 5S RNA cannot be amplified along with the
18S, 28S, and 5.8S rRNA genes is not apparent. Xenopus, and most other
organisms, have gone to considerable trouble to separate the synthesis
of 5S and the other ribosomal RNAs. Even the RNA polymerases used
are different: 5S uses RNA polymerase III whereas 18S, 28S, and 5.8S
use polymerase I. 

As the oocyte matures, ribosome synthesis and most other activity
ceases  until  fertilization  activates  protein  synthesis.  Then,  after  the
developing embryo has reached the 4,000 cell stage, 5S ribosomal RNA
synthesis begins again. A small fraction of the RNA synthesized at this
time  is  the  RNA  species  which  was  synthesized  in  the  oocyte.  Most,
however, possesses a slightly different sequence. It is called somatic 5S
RNA. The oocyte 5S RNA synthesis soon ceases altogether, leaving just
the somatic 5S RNA synthesis. The haploid genome of Xenopus contains
about 450 copies of the somatic variety of 5S gene in contrast to about
100,000 copies of the variety expressed only in oocytes. 

Study of 5S RNA synthesis is attractive because the 5S genes show
developmental regulation in that the oocyte 5S genes are expressed only
in the developing oocyte whereas the somatic 5S genes are expressed
both  in  the  oocyte and  in  the developing  embryo.  In  addition  to  the
simple timing pattern of 5S RNAs, the product of the synthesis is simple.
The 5S RNA is not processed by capping, polyadenylation, or splicing,
nor is there a tissue specificity in the expression. Hence this seems like
an ideal material for study of developmental questions.

446  Xenopus 5S RNA Synthesis

In vitro  5 S   R N A   S y n t h e s i s

What is required to reproduce in vitro the regulation of 5S RNA synthe-
sis that is seen in vivo? A conservative approach in attempting to answer
this type of question is to begin as near to the biological situation as
possible and to work backward towards a system containing only known
and purified components, each performing a well-understood function.
During each of the steps in moving from the native biological system to
the  completely  defined  simple  system,  one’s  criterion  of  a  properly
working system is that correct regulation be maintained.

A logical first step in reproducing the biological regulation of Xenopus
5S RNA synthesis is to try injecting DNA coding for 5S RNA into oocytes.
Such injections are of medium technical difficulty. Due to the large size
of later stage oocytes, they can be isolated free of ovarian tissue, injected,
incubated,  and synthesis products  from individual or pooled oocytes
analyzed. Gurdon and Brown found that microinjecting the nuclei of
oocytes with either DNA purified from frog erythrocytes or with pure
plasmid DNA containing one or more 5S genes yielded synthesis of 5S
RNA. This synthesis could continue many hours or even for days after
the injection.

The next step toward a defined system also determined whether the
“living” oocyte possessed any mystical properties. That is, could 5S RNA
synthesis be achieved by an extract of nuclei purified from oocytes, or
were intact oocytes required? The experiments showed that nuclei were
capable of synthesizing the RNA. A major drawback to the experiments,
however, was the labor required to obtain the oocyte nuclei from the
ovaries. Not surprisingly, then, a simple cell extract of the entire oocyte
was tried, and found to be almost as effective in synthesizing 5S RNA
as the nuclear extracts. Generally chromatin, that is DNA plus associ-
ated proteins and histones, that is obtained by gently lysing cells and
taking whatever sediments with DNA, is a good template DNA.

Oocyte nuclear extracts using either DNA or chromatin were active
in synthesizing 5S RNA. When RNA polymerase III was tried instead of
the extracts, polymerase plus DNA was inactive, but polymerase with
chromatin  as a template  was active.  These  experiments demonstrate
that at least one factor, presumably a protein, in addition to DNA and
RNA polymerase  III,  is necessary for  5S  RNA  synthesis and  that  the
factor is associated with chromatin. The question then became one of
determining how many factors were required for synthesis of 5S RNA,
how many of the factors were associated with chromatin, and whether
properties of these factors explained either the shutoff of oocyte and
somatic 5S RNA synthesis in the oocyte or the later resumption of only
somatic 5S RNA synthesis.

Extracts prepared from unfertilized eggs do not support the synthesis
of either type of 5S RNA from a pure DNA template. If these extracts
are supplemented  with  extracts  prepared  from  oocytes  that  were ac-
tively  synthesizing  5S  RNA,  they  do  synthesize  5S  RNA.  Thus  the
unfertilized eggs provide an assay and the immature oocytes provide a
source for one of the required factors. Through this sort of approach
three  factors  have  been  found  that  stimulate  synthesis  of  5S  RNA,

TFIIIA Binding to the Middle of its Gene as Well as to RNA  447

TFIIIA, TFIIIB, and TFIIIC. Other genes that are transcribed by RNA
polymerase III, like some tRNA genes, the gene encoding the U6 RNA
which is involved in splicing, and the adenovirus VA gene, utilize TFIIIB
and  TFIIIC  only.  TFIIIA  was  the  easiest  to  purify  and  study,  and
therefore the most is known about it. This protein is monomeric and
has a molecular weight 37,000. 

TFIIIA Binding to the Middle of its Gene as Well as to RNA

Prokaryotic promoters are located upstream from their genes. There-
fore it was logical to look in front of 5S genes for the sequences necessary
for synthesis of 5S RNA. Finding these sequences could be approached
with the tools of molecular genetics. Nuclear extracts capable of accu-
rately synthesizing 5S RNA were used with pure DNA templates. A series
of  templates  could  be  generated  with  progressively  larger  deletions
approaching, and even entering the 5’ end of the 5S gene. After deletion
of the natural sequences, the plasmids were ligated closed and trans-
formed into bacteria for biological synthesis of large quantities of the
DNA. The product of the constructions was a substitution of plasmid
sequence for what had been native Xenopus sequence ahead of the 5S
gene (Fig. 15.3).

The deletion experiments were remarkable. Deleting all of the natural
sequence ahead of the 5S sequence did not reduce synthesis of the 5S
RNA to less than 50% of normal. Even when the first 40 nucleotides of
the sequence were deleted, an RNA product of about the 120 nucleotide
size of  5S RNA was  synthesized. In this case the first 20 nucleotides
synthesized were specified by plasmid DNA sequence (Fig. 15.4). Only
when  the  deletions extended beyond about  position 50 inside the 5S
gene did they block synthesis.

The location of the downstream edge of the sequences necessary for
5S RNA synthesis is also of interest. The experiments to determine this
position required a technical trick. In the experiments probing for the

sequences necessary for transcription initiation, the natural termina-
tion sequence of the 5S gene remained intact. Therefore, whatever the
sequence of the RNA at its 5’ end, transcription still terminated normally
and yielded an RNA molecule of about 120 nucleotides. The presence
of  this  RNA  could  be  determined  simply  by  arranging  that  the  RNA
synthesized  in  vitro  be  radioactive  and  then  running  the  resultant
products on an acrylamide gel. When 5S RNA had been synthesized in
a reaction, it formed a prominent band in the gel. Such a simple assay
technique could not work if the sequences at the 3’ end of the gene that
are required for termination were deleted.

Hybridization  assays  could  be  devised  to  look  for  RNA  sequences
from the remaining 5’ end of the deleted 5S gene. These assays however,
would also detect any readthrough transcription resulting from incor-
rect initiation events occurring upstream of the 5S gene (Fig. 15.5). A
better assay for 5S RNA synthesis was to force the 5S RNA to terminate
prematurely, before it reached sequences that might be altered due to
deletion of the 3’ end of the gene. These terminations could be generated
by introducing a transcription terminator in the region between the start
site of transcription and the beginning of the sequence already deter-
mined to be required for transcription (Fig. 15.6). A simpler approach,

cluding 5S sequences is not a good
assay for activity of specific tran-
scription of the 5S RNA gene due
to nonspecific transcription which

but one based on this basic idea, was taken. This used the same trick as
is used in DNA sequencing. In the triphosphates used for transcription
was included a low concentration of a 3’-dideoxy-triphosphate. When a
molecule of this analog was incorporated into the growing RNA chain,
no further elongation was possible. At appropriately low concentrations
of a 3’deoxy-triphosphate, a characteristic spectrum of sizes of prema-
turely  terminated  RNA  molecules  results  (Fig.  15.7).  Transcription
initiating at other points on the chromosome generate other spectra of
prematurely terminated molecules. Despite the presence of these groups
of RNA molecules, the spectrum indicative of initiation from the 5S RNA
promoter could be identified and therefore the activity of this promoter
could easily be assayed.

The  experiments  probing  for  the  location  of  the  3’  end  of  the  se-
quences necessary for normal initiation of the 5S gene were successful.
The downstream edge of the sequences required was between positions
80 and 83. That is, within the gene, between positions 50 and 80 lies a
stretch of 30 nucleotides which are required for correct synthesis of the
5S RNA.

Does TFIIIA bind within the interior of the 5S gene? Indeed it does.
DNAse footprinting experiments show that it protects the region from
about +50 to +80. Similarly, pre-ethylation experiments in which those
phosphates are determined whose ethylation prevents or substantially

weakens  binding  of  the  protein  also  revealed  the  binding  site  of  the
protein to be entirely within the gene. These deletion and biochemical
experiments show that TFIIIA determines where RNA polymerase III
initiates on the 5S gene.

The TFIIIA protein revealed  an additional unexpected  property. It
was  noticed  that  an  excess  of  5S  RNA  in  the  in  vitro  transcription
reactions  inhibited  transcription  of  the  5S  gene.  This  type  of  result
suggests that the RNA inhibits RNA polymerase. This possibility could
be simply tested since RNA polymerase III also transcribes tRNA genes.
If the 5S RNA inhibited RNA polymerase, it should block synthesis of
both 5S RNA and tRNA. It did not. It blocked only 5S RNA synthesis.
Therefore, 5S RNA must bind TFIIIA, thereby titrating TFIIIA from the
DNA. Indeed, this is true and the dual binding ability of TFIIIA appears
to be of biological importance as one of the proteins in the 7S complex
of 5S RNA is TFIIIA.

Switching from Oocyte to Somatic 5S Synthesis

In vitro transcription experiments revealed an unexpected property of
5S transcription. Brown and co-workers discovered that once TFIIIA
had bound to a DNA molecule, it did not easily or rapidly dissociate and
bind  to  a  different  molecule.  Even  multiple  rounds  of  transcription
could not displace a bound TFIIIA molecule. Demonstrating this prop-
erty is rather simple. Consider two different kinds of DNA templates for
5S RNA, one containing an insertion of a few bases so that the resulting
product  is  distinguishably  larger  when  run  on  polyacrylamide  gels.
When the two types of templates were added to a reaction together, both
sizes of RNA were synthesized, but under conditions of limiting TFIIIA;
whichever template was first added encoded all the resulting RNA. The
TFIIIA remained associated with its DNA upon dilution or even through
40 rounds of transcription.

Complexes of TFIIIA formed in vivo also possess high stability. These
experiments can be done in the following way. As increasing quantities
of DNA containing the 5S gene are injected into oocytes, eventually the
synthesis  of  5S  RNA  saturates.  This  can  be  shown  to  be  due  to  the
titration of TFIIIA factor. Injection of TFIIIA factor relieves the satura-
tion and permits synthesis of still more 5S RNA. Secondly, if template
for  tRNA,  which  does  not  require  TFIIIA,  is  included  in  the  second
injection of 5S template along with template for 5S RNA, only the tRNA
template is active. This shows that RNAP III has not been titrated out.
Once it is known that TFIIIA is limiting, the inactivity of the 5S template
added to an already template saturated oocyte means that no significant
amount of TFIIIA dissociates from the first template during the experi-
ment.

The  somatic  5S  genes,  but  not  the  oocyte  5S  genes  in  chromatin
isolated from somatic cells are active in some types of extracts. What
maintains the set state of these two types of genes? Not surprisingly, the
somatic genes contain bound TFIIIA. Not only do the oocyte genes lack
TFIIIA,  but  provision  of  extra  TFIIIA  does  not  activate  them.  One

Switching from Oocyte to Somatic 5S Synthesis  451

explanation could be that histones on the DNA block access of TFIIIA
to  its  binding  site.  Indeed,  various  histones  can  be  stripped  from
chromatin by extraction in buffers containing high concentrations of
salt. Extraction with 0.6 M NaCl removes histone H1 and at the same
time permits TFIIIA activation of oocyte 5S genes. Similarly, stripping
the chromatin  of  histones  by  high  salt,  addition  of  TFIIIA,  and then
reformation of chromatin by addition of the histones and slow removal
of the salt leave the oocyte genes active.

We can generate a simple picture to explain the histone results. After
replication, the DNA is bare behind the replication fork. Under these
conditions both TFIIIA and histones should be able to bind to the 5S
gene. If TFIIIA binds first, a complete transcription complex forms. This
possesses sufficient stability to remain in place for long periods. Once
it has the complex is present, nucleosomes are free to form on either
side. The presence of the TFIIIA and the absence of histone bound at
the 5S gene means that transcription can begin despite the presence of
histones elsewhere on the template. Conversely, if histones bind first to
the gene, they remain bound and prevent formation of a transcription
complex.  In  this  case  the  5S  gene  cannot  be  activated,  even  by  the
subsequent addition of large amounts of TFIIIA. Hence the long-term
transcriptional abilities of the 5S genes could be determined at the time
of their replication.

Just as a transcription complex must be present to prevent histones
from binding to the critical part of the 5S gene, those genes transcribed
by RNAP II must also be prevented from being locked in an off state.
General  or  specific  transcription  factors  must  perform  this  role  for
mRNA genes. One attractive candidate for a general transcription factor
that would often serve this role is TFIID, which binds to the TATA box
of the promoter region of genes transcribed by RNA Pol II.

The high stability of TFIIIA binding raises the possibility of a simple

explanation for the switch between oocyte and somatic 5S RNA synthe-
sis.  In  principle,  the  developmental  switch  could  be  simply  accom-
plished if TFIIIA itself had a substantial binding preference for somatic
genes. Then, in the developing oocyte with its vast excess of TFIIIA, both
somatic and oocyte genes would be active. However, as TFIIIA is titrated
out into the 7S and 42S particles, the functional excess would vanish
and the genes would be occupied by TFIIIA in proportion to the protein’s
binding preference for the two slightly different sequences. The main
problem with this explanation is that, experimentally, TFIIIA has too
small a preference for the somatic genes to explain the thousand-fold
change in the relative activities of the two types of genes. If the oocyte
sequence of the 5S gene itself is changed nucleotide by nucleotide to
that of the somatic 5S, there is some effect in the correct direction. The
changes at positions 47, 53, 55, and 56 of the gene do make the oocyte
gene behave more like the somatic genes, in oocyte extracts in which
the activity of TFIIIA is being monitored, but the change is insufficient
to explain the dramatic difference between the two genes in vivo. The
conclusion has to be that the nucleotide differences between the somatic

452  Xenopus 5S RNA Synthesis

and oocyte 5S RNA genes are sensed by the entire transcription complex
consisting of TFIIIA, B, C, and RNA polymerase III.

Structure and Function of TFIIIA

One of the motivations for studying regulation of the 5S genes was the
hope that phenomena totally unheard of in prokaryotes would be found
in eukaryotes, and the first well-studied eukaryotic system seemed likely
to  yield  a  rich  harvest.  For  the  most  part,  what  has  been  found  has
turned out to be phenomena that are not unique either to the 5S genes
or to eukaryotes. For example, the stable state that is determined by a
protein or complex of proteins that remain bound for long periods of
time has proven to be a valuable concept, but it is not unique either to
eukaryotes  or  to  the  5S  system.  Even  the  startling  discovery  of  an
internal control region turns out not to be unique, either to eukaryotes
or to genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.  The zinc fingers, which
were first found in TFIIIA, are a common structure in eukaryotes, but
they also exist in prokaryotes.

The  discovery  of  the  zinc  fingers  is  illustrative  of  the  unexpected
source for many discoveries. While exploring the cause for substantial
losses  during  the  purification  of  TFIIIA  from  7S  particles,  workers
noticed that steps like gel filtration that could separate the protein from
small molecules led to substantial loss of TFIIIA activity. Also, addition
of metal ion chelators increased losses. Prior addition of Zn++, but not
other ions, prevented the losses. With this strong clue that zinc ion was
involved,  they  performed  atomic  adsorption  spectroscopy  and  found
indeed that each molecule of the protein contained five to ten zinc ions.
The  presence  of  multiple  ions  in  the  protein  suggested  that  an
ion-binding substructure or domain might be repeated within the pro-
tein. This suspicion was reinforced by the finding that upon extended
proteolytic digestion of the protein there remained multiple species of
a  3,000-4,000  dalton  peptide.  Upon  examining  the  sequence  of  the
protein for a repeated sequence of about 30 amino acids, one was found.
The marvelous property of these repeating units was that they possessed

two cysteines and two histidines spaced just as required for these four
amino acids to chelate zinc (Fig. 15.8), as was discussed in Chapter 6.
Since TFIIIA possesses nine zinc fingers, and each can contact three
bases of of the DNA, the protein can contact part of the 40 bases of the
essential  internal  control  region  in  the  5S  gene.  The  portion  of  the
protein that does not contact DNA likely contacts one or both of the
other proteins required for most active transcription of 5S genes, TFIIIB
or IIIC. There is a 10,000 dalton portion of the protein at the N-terminal
end that probably is involved in this function since it does not possess
zinc  fingers  and  its  removal  eliminates  transcriptional  activation  by
TFIIIA.

The structure of a zinc finger was predicted by comparison with other
proteins containing liganded metal ions and close examination of the
sequences of zinc fingers. Subsequent determination of the structure of
artificial zinc fingers by nuclear magnetic resonance methods and X-ray
crystallography confirmed the predicted structure.

Rapid  progress  has  been  made  in  learning  the  basic  structure  and
properties  of  a  great  many  regulated  genes  and  gene  families  of  eu-
karyotic  cells.  Much  of  the  progress  is  attributable  to  the  power  of
genetic engineering, which has made the task of cloning and sequencing
many eukaryotic genes relatively straightforward. Once a gene has been
cloned, its own sequences, and sequences governing its regulation can
be determined. In the most amenable cases, sequences of the gene and
of its promoter and regulatory elements, and any sequences the gene
product interacts with, may all be deleted or altered. In some cases the
DNA  can  be  reintroduced  into  the  original  organism  to  examine  the
consequences of the alterations.

After the effects of DNA modifications on the expression of a gene
have been explored, the effect on the organism of the altered regulation
can  be  investigated  and the biochemical  mechanisms  underlying  the
regulation can be more easily studied. In a few systems the depth of our
understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation approaches or exceeds that
of prokaryotic genes. One example of a well-studied eukaryotic system
is the mating-type genes of baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A  haploid  yeast  cell  contains  both  a-  and  α-mating  type  genetic
information. Although normally only one or the other is expressed, a
cell  can  switch  from  one  to  the  other.  This  appears  to  be  a  more
complicated  example  of  differentiation  than  that  considered  in  the
previous chapter, but one that is still relatively simple. Nonetheless, it
appears  to  contain  many  of  the  elements  found  in  the  much  more
complicated differentiation systems  of higher  eukaryotes. One of the
virtues of this system is that both genetic and biochemical approaches
may be applied to it.

458  Regulation of Mating Type in Yeast

The Yeast Cell Cycle

Yeast  come  in  three  cell-types,  the  haploid  MATa  and  MATα  mating
types,  and  diploid  MATa/α.  Haploid  cells  of  opposite  cell  types  can
conjugate to form a diploid a/α cell which is incapable of further mating.
Under  starvation  conditions  the  a/α  diploid,  but  not  haploid  cells,
undergo meiosis to generate two a and two α mating-type spores in a
structure called an ascus.

The  status  of  the  mating  type  of  a  clone  or  colony  can  easily  be

determined by mating with tester strains of known mating type (Fig.
16.1).  Colonies to be checked  should  possess at  least one nutritional
requirement  for  growth. These  colonies  can  be grown  on rich  plates
containing all necessary nutrients and then replica plated onto lawns of
tester cells of mating type MATa and of mating type MATα that possess
different nutritional requirements. After several hours of mating on rich
medium, the plates are replicated onto minimal medium plates lacking
the nutritional requirements of both the colonies to be checked and the
tester strains. Combinations of parental cells that can mate will yield
diploid conjugants capable of growing on the minimal medium through
complementation of the defective alleles.

Mating Type Conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  459

Most  yeasts  isolated  from  nature  change  their  mating  type  nearly
every generation. A culture of such yeast will therefore contain cells of
a and α mating type that can conjugate to produce a/α diploids which
grow,  but  which  do  not  mate  further  or  change  mating  type.  These
switching cells are therefore called homothallic for their capability of
mating with sister cells. To assay the current mating type status of such
homothallic yeast, the behavior of individual cells must be examined.
Fortunately this is straightforward since cells of opposite mating type
expand towards one another in a characteristic shape called a shmoo
which is easily recognized in the microscope.

a

Yeast  that  are  to  conjugate  must  induce  and  repress  appropriate
genes so as to synchronize their cell cycles, grow and adhere together,
and finally fuse both cytoplasm and nucleus. Cells of one mating type
sense the nearby presence of the opposite mating type by pheromone
peptides  of  12  and  13  amino  acids  long.  Each  cell-type  secretes  one
pheromone and responds to the pheromone secreted by the opposite
cell-type. The pheromone receptors span the membrane and are similar
to rhodopsin and β-adrenergic receptors. On their cytoplasmic side the
receptors  interact  with  signaling  proteins  known  as  G  proteins  and
through cascades of regulatory proteins, ultimately induce and repress
the genes necessary for conjugation.

Mating Type Conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Yeast possessing the ho allele switch from mating type  MATa, to MATα
or vice versa at a frequency of about 10-6 per doubling time, whereas
yeast  possessing  the  HO  allele,  the  form  most  commonly  found  in
nature, switch mating types as frequently as once each generation.

As in the study of many biological phenomena, the study of mutants
revealed hidden details of the mating-type system. Saccharomyces mat-
ing-type mutants showed an astonishing fact. If an ho strain which is
MATα-, making it defective in mating, is switched to MATa and then
switched back to MATα, the original defect, the MATα- mutation, disap-

additional times the a-α conversion is performed. New MATα- mutations
can be isolated in the healed strain, and these too heal upon mating-type
switching. The only reasonable conclusion is the one first postulated by

copies  of  the  MATa  and  MATα  information  on  the  chromosome  in
addition to the expressible forms of MATa or MATα information. The
reference sites are named HML and HMR, and the expression site is

mating-type  information,  and  HMR  contains  a  type  information.  As
explained below, direct physical data have confirmed this conclusion.

Cloning the Mating Type Loci in Yeast

How could the existence of reference copies of mating-type information
at HML and HMR and an expression copy at MAT be proven physically?
The most straightforward proof is simply to clone DNA copies from the
three loci and use Southern transfers to show that the DNA occupying
the MAT locus comes from HML or HMR and changes with a shift in
mating type.

Cloning  the  mating-type  loci  required  both  a  convenient  genetic
selection for the presence of mating-type genes and a suitable vector.
Due to the low efficiency of yeast transformation, unreasonably large

quantities  of  yeast  DNA,  restriction  enzymes,  and  ligase  would  have
been  required  if  investigators  had  tried  directly  to  transform  yeast.
Instead, the yeast DNA was ligated into a bacterial-yeast shuttle vector,
transformed into bacteria, amplified to suitable levels, extracted, and
this was used to transform the yeast (Fig. 16.3).

The genetic selection for mating-type DNA was straightforward. The
source  DNA  derived  from  yeast  capable  of  mating,  that  is,  having  a
functional  MAT  locus.  The  amplified  plasmid  DNA  was  transformed
into a yeast strain possessing a defect in the MAT locus causing sterility.
Therefore, after the transformation, the yeast having received a plasmid
carrying  the  MAT  locus  would  become  capable  of  mating  and  could
easily be detected. The plasmid could then be isolated from the yeast
and transferred into E. coli for amplification.

Transfer of Mating Type Gene Copies to an Expression Site

Once the MATα mating-type clone had been obtained by Hicks, Strath-
ern, and Klar, and by Nasmyth and Tatchell, Southern transfer experi-
ments testing DNA transposition to the MAT locus were possible. Yeast
DNA  was  cut  with  various  restriction  enzymes  and  was  separated
according to size by electrophoresis. The locations of the α-specific or
a-specific sequences were determined by hybridization using the cloned
α or a sequences as probe.

We might expect that the α mating-type locus would have no homol-
ogy to the a mating-type locus. Then, in the DNA from a MATα cell there
would  be  two  different  DNA  fragments  with  homology  to  the  MATα
locus, one from MATα itself, and one from HML or HMR. From a MATa
cell we would expect only one fragment with homology to the α mating
type  sequence.  Surprisingly,  a  different  answer  emerged.  The  α  se-
quence  also  possesses  partial  homology  to  a  mating-type  sequences.
Therefore three different sizes of restriction fragments were observed
in  the  DNA  from  MATa  or  MATα  cells  probed  with  either  a  or  α
sequences (Fig. 16.4). These are sequences at HML, HMR, and MAT.

The fact that the a-specific and α-specific sequences were partially
homologous, but of different size permitted a direct and simple demon-

stration of the basis of mating-type conversion. The genetic data indi-
cated that sequences from HML or HMR were copied into MAT, where
they were expressed. Because the a mating-type sequence is about 100
nucleotides shorter than the α mating type, the identity of the sequence
occupying  the  MAT  locus  can  be  directly  determined  on  Southern
transfers (Fig. 16.5). The experiments showed, as expected, that mating
type a cells possessed the a sequences at MAT, and that mating type α
cells  possessed  the  α  sequences  at  MAT.  The  Southern  transfer  of  a
diploid yeast that possesses a MATa/MATα genotype yields two bands
originating from the MAT locus that differ in size by 100 base pairs. The
identity of the shorter and longer mating-type segments was determined
by  isolating  spores,  growing,  and  testing  both  genetically  as  well  as
performing a transfer. The a-type cultures possess only the shorter MAT
sequence and the α-type cultures possess only the longer MAT sequence.

Structure of the Mating Type Loci

Cloning the mating-type sequences permitted direct determination of
their structures. DNA-DNA heteroduplexes revealed the overall struc-
tural similarities and differences, while DNA sequencing was used to
examine  the  detailed aspects of the  structures.  The a-  and α-specific
sequences are denoted by Ya and Yα are relatively small, only about 800
base pairs long. In addition to these regions, the HML, MAT, and HMR
loci are flanked by common sequences W, X, Y, Z1 and Z2.

The RNA transcripts from either of the MAT regions originate from
near the center and extend outward in both directions, giving transcripts
a1 and a2 or α1 and α2. These transcripts were identified by S1 mapping
by extracting RNA from cells, hybridizing it to end-labeled DNA frag-
ments,  and  digesting  the  remaining  single-stranded  RNA  and  DNA.
Measurement of the size of the DNA that was protected from digestion
by the RNA and knowledge of the locations of the labeled end of the
DNA fragment give the transcription start points. On the basis of genetic
complementation tests, the α1, α2, and a1 transcripts are translated into
protein, but the a2 is not translated. Consistent with this conclusion is

the fact that no mutations have been found in the a2 region and the a2
transcript lacks a good open reading frame preceded by an AUG codon.

The Expression and Recombination Paradoxes

Two important questions are raised by the structure of the mating-type
loci and the locations of transcripts in MATa and MATα. First, how is
transposition always forced to proceed from HML or HMR to MAT and
never the reverse, and second, how is expression of a or α from HML or
HMR prevented?

Relatively little is known about the biochemistry of the transposition
reaction.  The  available  data  suggest  that  a  direct  transfer  of  DNA
through a free diffusible intermediate does not occur, but instead that
mating-type shift is a result of gene conversion (See Chapter 8) type of
substitution reaction in which the appropriate information from HML
or HMR is copied into MAT (Fig. 16.6). In part, this conclusion is based
on the failure to find free DNA copies of sequences from HML or HMR
in yeast.

One simple method for expressing sequences at MAT and not express-
ing  the  sequences  at  HML  or  HMR  would  have  been  for  the  region
around MAT to provide a promoter that specifies transcription across
whatever sequence has been inserted at MAT. This is not the explana-
tion, however, for transcription of α and a genes begins from within the
mating  type-specific  Y  sequences.  Another  possibility  is  that  an  en-
hancer is near the MAT region so that whatever is inserted into MAT is
expressed. It is also possible that repression occurs at HML and HMR.

Figure 16.7  Something has to act at a distance to regulate the promoters of
mating  type  genes.  Either  repression  acts  from  afar  at  HML  and  HMR  or
activation acts over a distance at MAT.

Since it is hundreds of nucleotides from the mating type-specific pro-
moter to sequences unique to the HML, HMR or MAT loci, activation or
repression would have to occur over a substantial distance (Fig. 16.7).
While  such  “action  at  a  distance”  events  are  frequently  found  for
activation  of  transcription,  they  are  less  often  seen  for  repression  of
transcription.  Nonetheless,  genetics  experiments  revealed  that  it  is
repression at HML and HMR that actually occurs. This same repression
or silencing mechanism of the mating-type promoters also blocks trans-
fer of the donor information at HML and HMR to MAT.

Silencing HML and HMR

The  roles  of  the  mating-type  genes  have  been  defined  for  cell-type
determination.  α1  is  an  activator  of  α  mating-type  genes,  α2  is  a
repressor of a mating-type genes, and a1 plays no role in haploid cells
(Fig. 16.8). To generate the a and α mating types it would suffice if α1
product activated α type genes, which otherwise would be off, and if α2
product  repressed  a  type  genes,  which  otherwise  would  be  on.  This,
however, would not provide for correct expression in diploid cells where
the haploid-specific genes must be repressed and diploid-specific genes
must be turned on. Genetic experiments examining the expression of
mating type-specific genes have revealed that in addition to the pattern
mentioned above, in diploid cells the a1 product and α2 product com-
bine  to  form  a  repressor  of  haploid-specific  genes  and  activator  of
diploid-specific genes. Without such a repressor, α type genes would be
expressed in diploids. One way to start to work out the control circuitry
is to isolate mutations that disrupt the normal regulation patterns.

If proteins repress expression of genes located in HML and HMR, then
mutations in such repressor proteins should permit  expression of mat-
ing-type information from these loci. Such mutant cells could behave
as  a/α  diploids  since  they  would  express  both  a  and  α  mating-type
information simultaneously if they had the two types of mating infor
-
mation at HML and HMR. As a result, they would be sterile for mating.
Such  mutants  have  been  found.  A  second  approach  to  isolation  of
repression negative mutants is to begin with cells that are HMLα-MATa-

the ability to repress at the HML or HMR loci, then that cell becomes α
mating type.

Cells possessing the necessary genotype were mutagenized and colo-
nies were screened for a shift from a to α mating type. This was a simple
replica plating assay for mating ability. Amongst the large number of
candidates screened, four repressor genes turned up. These are called
the MAR or SIR genes. The existence of these genes and the behavior of
strains mutant in these genes proves that repression prevents expression
of mating-type genes at the HML and HMR loci.

The next question that can be asked about repression of the mating-
type information is where are the DNA sites that are required to generate
the repression? These must lie in the DNA sequences unique to the HML
and  HMR  loci,  for  otherwise  the  repressor  SIR  genes  would  repress
mating-type information at MAT as well. Precisely where they lie could
be found by deletion mapping. This was most easily done by placing an
entire HML or HMR region on a yeast shuttle vector which could be
introduced into yeast possessing essentially the same genotype as de-
scribed  above  (Fig.  16.10).  A  deletion  that  eliminates  repression  of
HMLα shifts the cell’s mating type from a to α. Such sites lie on both
sides of HML and both sides of HMR. Currently the best guess as to the
mechanism of action of silencing is that MAR or SIR gene products,
histone, and other proteins organize the HM loci chromatin such that
they are inaccessible to RNA polymerase but accessible for interaction
with the MAT locus for gene conversion.

Isolation of α2 Protein

The combination of the low synthesis levels of most regulatory proteins
and the fact that few possess any enzymatic activity makes their detec-

Isolation of α2 Protein  467

tion difficult. The lac repressor was first detected by virtue of its binding
to iso-propyl-thio-galactoside, IPTG, an inducer of the system that is not
cleaved by β-galactosidase. No small molecule effector of the mating-
type factors is known, and as will be seen below, none is necessary. Some
other method had to be used to identify the α protein.

One approach to the isolation of mating type encoded factors could
be  the  DNA  migration  retardation  assay  using  short  DNA  fragments
containing an appropriate binding site. If the protein binds, the electro-
phoretic migration rate of the fragment is greatly reduced. This assay is
sufficiently selective that it can detect a specific DNA-binding protein
present at only a tiny fraction of total protein. That is, the assay often
can detect a specific DNA-binding protein in crude extracts of the cells.
Nowadays this assay is the method of choice for initial attempts to detect
proteins that bind to DNA.

Since α2 protein does not come equipped with a convenient enzyme
assay  and  the  DNA  retardation  assay  was  not  then  in  wide  use,
Herskowitz and Johnson used a clever trick for the isolation of α2. They

fused the entire α2 gene to β-galactosidase. The fusion protein functions
in vivo to repress a-specific genes normally, and the β-galactosidase also
retains its activity. Therefore, the enzyme can be used both to assist the
purification by its known behavior in purification steps, and to assay
protein fractions for the hybrid protein during the purification. Despite
susceptibility  to  proteolytic  cleavage  in  the  cell  extracts,  the  fusion
protein could be partially purified by conventional techniques by track-
ing  the  β-galactosidase  activity  through  conventional  fractionation
steps.

Two assays of DNA binding by α2 fusion protein could be used. The
first links a radioactive DNA fragment containing an α2-binding site to
Staphlococcus  aureus  cells  via  antibody  and  α2-β-galactosidase  in  a
DNA−α2-β-gal-antibody-cell  sandwich  (Fig.  16.11).  The  bacteria  and
their associated complex can be sedimented with a low speed centrifu-
gation and separated from other proteins and from control DNA frag-
ments not containing an α2-binding site. DNA isolated from the complex
was then subjected to electrophoresis to verify that only the correct DNA
fragment  was  sedimented in the  complex.  Another assay for  specific
binding of α2 protein was DNAse footprinting.

The binding of α2 to its recognition sequence represses expression of
a  mating-type  genes.  Might  α2  be  able  to  repress  other  genes  if  its
binding sequence were placed in the regulatory region? The answer was
yes,  but  the  results  were  not  simple.  We  can  imagine  repression  as

resulting from steric exclusion of the binding of another protein. This
was not the case for α2 repressor. Introducing its binding site anywhere
upstream of the cytochrome c gene promoter generated repression. The
binding sequence could be between the enhancer and the TATA box, or
even somewhat upstream of the enhancer element. It did not have to
overlap  another  protein-binding site. Thus, α2 seems to repress  by a
different mechanism than by simple steric exclusion.

DNAse footprinting revealed an unexpectedly large binding site for α2.
It had two protected regions around a central unprotected region. Since
the central protected region possessed a symmetric sequence, it seemed
possible that an additional protein bound there.

Two kinds of experiments could be used to look for a possible second
protein. The first was to ask whether the central region of the α2-binding
site is involved in repression, and the second was to dissect α2 protein
into functional domains. It is relatively straightforward to construct and
insert altered α2-binding sites in front of genes. When this was done, it
was found that if their sites were altered in the central region, repression
did  not  occur  despite  the  binding  of  α2.  This  means  that  either  the
central region affects the activity of the bound protein without affecting
its binding, or that an additional protein binds in this region by making
use of the central region DNA sequence.

The DNA migration retardation assay was used to look for a protein
that binds with α2 to repress genes. One was found. It could be purified,
and its binding to the site studied. It binds cooperatively with α2 protein.

Figure 16.12  The MCM1 protein functions as an activator when alone, and as
a repressor when it is flanked by the α2 protein.

The sequence to which it binds is found in front of some other genes
whose activity is regulated by the mating type of the cells. In some cases
the protein is an activator, and in others it is a repressor. When the  α2
sequences flank the site, the complex acts as a repressor (Fig. 16.12).
This protein, which has finally come to be called MCM1 has also been
found in other types of cells. Its close relative is found in human cells
where it is a transcription factor that activates genes in response to the
presence of serum and is known as the serum response factor.

The α2  protein  could  also be  dissected  by deleting  DNA  segments
from  a  plasmid  containing  the  α2-β-galactosidase  fusion  gene.  The
resulting  proteins  lost  their  DNA-binding  activities  only  when  a  60
amino  acid  portion  near  the  carboxyl  terminus  of  the  protein  was
deleted. These proteins lost their ability to repress, however, when short
stretches of amino acids near the N-terminus were deleted. The resulting
proteins could still bind to DNA. Thus they were synthesized, stable,
capable of binding to DNA, but had lost a domain required for repres-
sion.

Sterile Mutants, Membrane Receptors and G Factors

One method for exploring the complexity of the mating-type system is
to determine the range of defective mutant types that can be isolated.
Additionally,  mutants  greatly  facilitate  biochemical  studies,  as  they
often permit associating a particular biochemical defect with a response
of the system. Sterile mutants are particularly easy to isolate. Wild-type
haploid cells cease growth in the presence of the opposite mating type
sex  pheromone.  Therefore,  any  cells  that  continue  growth  must  be
defective  in  their  detection  of  or  response  to  the  sex  pheromones.
Suitable pheromone for this selection can be obtained from the medium
by growing α mating type cells to a high density, although chemically
synthesized α type pheromone is now cheaper and more pure. The a

pheromone cannot easily be synthesized because it is only active when
when post-translationally modified to a form not easily synthesized in
vitro. 

Amongst  the  sterile  mutants  which  can  be  found  by  resistance  to
growth factor inhibition are those lacking the receptor for mating-type
pheromone. These mutants can be identified by their lack of binding of
radioactive factor to intact cells. Of course, once such defective mutants
are found, the gene responsible can be isolated. This has been done, and
the sequences of the a and α receptors turn out to be similar to a class
of  membrane  receptors  including  both  rhodopsin  and  β-adrenergic
receptor. These proteins possess seven hydrophobic regions that cross
the membrane seven times (Fig. 16.13). In general these proteins couple
extracellular events to intracellular actions.

In higher cells the next protein in the chain from membrane receptors
to alterations in gene expression is called G protein because it normally
binds GDP. In the absence of stimulation, one of the three subunits of
G  binds  GDP.  Upon  stimulation,  the  α  subunit  of  G  binds  GTP  and

dissociates from the β and γ subunits. It has been difficult in higher cells
to determine whether it is the α subunit that activates or the β-γ dimer
that activates the next step in a signaling pathway. In yeast, however, it
is quite clear that the β-γ pair play an important role in regulation, for
an absence of the α subunit or an excess of β and γ generates the same
response as exposure to mating factor. Judged on the similarity of their

DNA Cleavage at the MAT Locus  471

amino acid sequences to proteins with known activities, the later pro-
teins in the signal chain are likely to be protein kinases. The final protein
in the signaling chain is a transcription factor which binds and activates
transcription of the appropriate genes.

DNA Cleavage at the MAT Locus

A key step in the shifting of mating type is the transfer of the genetic
information from HML and HMR to MAT. Apparently the transfer is
initiated by cleaving the DNA at the MAT locus. A specific endonuclease,
much like a restriction enzyme, could generate a double-stranded break
in  DNA  at  the  MAT  locus.  How  could  such  an  enzyme  be  sought?
Restriction enzymes can be detected by their cleavage of DNA, such as
lambda  phage  or  plasmid  DNA.  If  the  mating-type  endonuclease  is
specific, then only DNA carrying the MAT locus and possibly the HML
and  HMR  loci  would  be  substrates.  Also,  the  enzyme  generating  the
cleavages should be found in haploid HO yeast but probably would not
be found in ho or in diploid yeast since these latter types do not switch
mating type.

A particularly sensitive assay was used to search for the predicted
cleavage (Fig. 16.14). A plasmid containing the mating-type region was
cut and end-labeled with  32PO4. Incubation of this DNA with extracts
prepared  from  various  yeast  strains  should  cut  the  DNA  somewhere
within the MAT locus. Such cleavage would generate a smaller radioac-
tive fragment which could be detected on electrophoresis of the diges-
tion mixture and autoradiography. As expected, HO haploids contain a
cleaving activity, and, furthermore, this activity is present at only one
part of the cell cycle, just before the period of DNA synthesis. Using this
cleavage assay, the enzyme has been partially purified, and biochemical
studies on it are now possible.

The site of DNA cleavage lies just within the MAT locus. Some of the
mutations  that  act  in  cis  to  prevent  the  normal  high  frequency  of

mating-type conversion do not generate the double-stranded break in
vivo. Most likely they prevent binding or cleavage by the HO nuclease,
and, as expected, they prevent cleavage in vitro. As is typical for most
restriction enzyme cleavage sites, these changes lie within 10 base pairs
of the cleavage site.

The HO endonuclease is particularly unstable. Presumably this re-
sults  from  the  requirement  that  any  cleavage  that  is  to  generate  a
mating-type  switch  must  be  made  in  a  narrow  window of time. The
regulation of the synthesis of HO messenger RNA also must be tight.
Apparently a sizeable number of proteins are involved in this regulation.
A region of DNA preceding the HO gene of over a thousand nucleotides
and about fifteen different proteins seem to be involved.

In HO cells the pattern of mating-type conversion is fixed. Only in a
cell that has produced at least one daughter, called a mother cell, does
a  mating-type  conversion  occur  (Fig.  16.15).  At  this  time  both  the
mother and daughter convert. The complex set of proteins that regulate
HO protein expression also compute this cell lineage and permit expres-
sion of the HO gene only in the mother and not in first-born daughters.

DNA Strand Inheritance and Switching in Fission Yeast

A yeast other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also widely studied. This
is Schizosaccharomyces pombe, schizo meaning divide, and pombe an
African  word  for  beer.  These  are  rod-shaped  cells  that  elongate  and
divide by fission into two equal-sized cells, in contrast to budding. Some
of the processes like mRNA splicing in S. pombe are more similar to
those found in higher eukaryotic cells than the corresponding functions
in S. cerevisiae.

The two mating types in S. pombe are called P for plus, and M, for
minus. The mating-type conversion occurs by transposition of copies of
genetic information derived from reference locations, mat2 and mat3,
into the expression locus mat1, much like that found in S. cerevisiae.

The  pedigree  of  switching is much different between the two yeasts,

cerevisiae, only a single sister switches in pombe. That is, only one of
four granddaughters of an originally unswitchable Pu cell switches (Fig.
16.16).

Problems

What mechanism directs just one of the two sisters of a Ps cell to
switch?  We  might  expect  that  some  molecule  in  the  cytoplasm  or
nucleus  is  unequally  expressed,  distributed,  or  stabilized  in  the  two
daughters, and therefore controls their different behavior. Instead, the
marking system appears to use strand-specific marking of the DNA. One
of the strands in a Pu is marked. After replication, only the chromatid
inheriting the marked strand is cleaved. This cell is then competent to
switch and is denoted Ps, and it produces one switched sister in the next
generation.

An  elegant  experiment  led  to  the  proposal  of  the  strand  marking
mechanism. A strain was constructed to contain an inverted duplication
of mat1 (Fig. 16.17). Thus, each of the two strands of the DNA duplex
contain a copy of the site that is marked for eventual cutting. Hence, in
the Pu cell, both strands are marked, and both sister cells derived from
the  cell  should  be  switchable,  and  indeed,  both  are.  Southern  blot
analysis to quantitate the level of cleavage also fits expectations. Thus,
for S. pombe, inheritance of parental DNA strands, which are comple-
mentary and not identical, confers developmental asymmetry to daugh-
ter cells.

cules involved in mating-type determination and function in light of the
fact that mating type can be detected to change nearly every generation
in HO cells?

16.2.  Describe  how  the  yeast  transformant  carrying a mating-type

gene could be detected.

16.3. How can dominance and recessivity of SIR genes be tested since

mating type can ordinarily be determined for haploid yeast only?

16.4.  A  mutation  known  as  rad52  is  lethal  in  haploid  HO  strains,
apparently because of the double-stranded break that is generated at the
MAT YZ site. How could the properties of this mutation be used to infer
that the mating  system  generates  no similar  breaks  elsewhere  in  the
yeast chromosomes?

16.5. How would you test whether the absence of the mating-specific
endonuclease  in  diploid  and  ho  yeast  results  from  its  failure  to  be
synthesized or from the synthesis of an inactivator of the enzyme?

16.6. Draw a scheme by which a double-stranded cleavage near MAT
could initiate a gene conversion in which an adjacent region is altered
to that of HML or HMR.

16.7. In seeking the enzyme that makes the double-stranded cut in
the MAT locus, why would it be wise to use HO haploid and not diploid
cells? What problem would this raise and how would you overcome it?
16.8. Why is it logical that the mating-type conversion be initiated by

16.13. Normally α mating-type information is at HML and a mating-
type information is at HMR. Of cells which could switch, starred in Fig.
16.15, about 94% do switch. When a mating-type information is at HML
and α mating-type information is at HMR, only 6% of the cells compe-
tent to switch actually do switch. What does this mean?

Genes Regulating
Development

17

A developing organism must regulate genes spatially and temporally. In
contrast  to  genes  of  the  arabinose  operon where the inducing  signal
comes from the environment of the cell, a developing embryo generates
its own signals for regulating genes. Such signals might be as simple as
cells  keeping  track  of  their  ancestors,  or  as  complicated  as  schemes
involving signaling between groups of cells. Electrical signals might be
used, but likely their range would be short. The simplest form of general
signaling  would  seem  to  be  to  use  chemicals,  which  we  shall  call
morphogens, whose concentrations can indicate positions. This would
be much like specifying locations on the earth with latitude and longi-
tude.

General Considerations on Signaling

In principle, three chemicals whose concentrations varied in the x, y,
and z directions would be sufficient to specify every important location
in a developing organism (Fig. 17.1). After determining its position, any
cell could induce or repress the genes appropriate to its position.

Generating  a  simple  coordinate  system  in  which  the  locations  of
points are determined by the concentrations of three chemicals presents
several problems. The first is simply creating the gradients. How are
gradients  to  be  built?  The  embryo  cannot  leave  it  to  chance  that  an
appropriate cell will start off the process of building a gradient, perhaps
by synthesizing and secreting some compound. Therefore, either certain
cells  are  special  as  a  result  of  their  lineage  and  they  will  set  up  the
gradients,  or  an  external  influence  directs  some  of  the  cells  in  the
embryo to behave differently from the rest. In either case, the embryo

develops an asymmetry, and this asymmetry defines an initial direction
or directions. 

Commonly, at least one external influence or definition of an axis of
the  developmental  coordinate  system  comes  from  the  mother.  The
maternal developmental signals must be special. They cannot be intro-
duced  into  the  egg  during  its  development  if  the  signal  is  a  freely
diffusing molecule. Any gradient in such a molecule would diffuse away
before  fertilization  and  embryo  development.  Therefore maternal ef-
fects  either  must  be  generated  during  development  or  they  must  be
placed in the egg in a way that diffusion cannot alter. Another useable
source of asymmetry  for an  embryo’s  coordinate system  is the entry
point of the fertilizing sperm.

To reach all cells, the chemicals used to specify location in an embryo
must be freely diffusible. If the gradients are set up in the egg after it
has been subdivided into cells, the chemicals must enter and leave cells
freely.  This  requires  that  the  molecule  be  small.  On  the  other  hand,
position might be determined before a fertilized egg has divided into
cells. Drosophila operates this way, and the embryo reaches about 4,000
nuclei before cell walls are synthesized. Thus, the morphogens can be
proteins.

If many different coordinate positions are to be distinguished along
one concentration gradient, precise measurements of the morphogen
concentration  must  be  made.  The  standard  biochemical  means  for
measuring concentration are simply measuring the amount of binding
of a chemical to a receptor with appropriate affinity (Fig. 17.2). This
method is incapable of discerning small differences in the concentration
of  a  substance,  but  detecting  such  differences  would  be  necessary  if
many different developmental cues are to be derived from one gradient.
Instead  of  using  a  few  gradients  to  determine  everything  about  a

developing  embryo,  it  is  more  logical  that  gross  patterns  are  first
developed  from  simple  gradients.  These  can  be  subdivided  as  many
times as necessary to produce as many different states as are required
for the developing embryo (Fig. 17.3).

Not  only  must  cells  determine  where  they  are  in  the  coordinate
system of morphogens, but they must do so crisply. The division lines
between different tissues must be sharp. Interpenetration of one tissue
into another would generate problems. Therefore we can expect devel-
oping organisms to use special techniques to make the division lines
sharp. One simple technique is to make decisions when there are as few
cells as possible. Another is to use a small embryo, for the smaller the
embryo, the steeper the gradients, and therefore the easier it is to make
decisions. Once an individual cell has determined what tissue or body
part it is to become, it can go through multiple cell divisions to generate
as  much  tissue  as  necessary.  A  second  general  way  to  make  sharp
dividing  lines  in  differentiating  tissue  is  to  make  the  processes  non-
linear. First, let us examine the linear situation. Suppose the decision
between becoming tissue of type A or type B depends on the amount of
morphogen bound to a protein, and that the binding is described by the

standard  Michaelis-Menten  equation.  Further,  assume  that  all  cells
whose receptors bind less than x1 of the morphogen become cell-type
A, and all cells whose receptors bind more than x2 of the morphogen
become type B. Cells that bind an intermediate amount of morphogen
can become type A or B (Fig. 17.4). A moderate number of cells could
exist in this indeterminate position. Suppose instead, that cells use a
more complex method of measuring concentration. They could use two
receptors and respond to two gradients or respond to a single morpho-
gen by requiring that two binding events occur. Then the response of
the receptor system could be made to be the product of two Michaelis-
Menton curves. This is nonlinear, and the transition between the critical
concentrations becomes much shorter. Therefore fewer cells are sub-
jected to indeterminate concentrations of morphogen. This principle of
making responses depend on multiple sensing systems can be used to
make particularly sharp responses. It is analogous to that used by phage
lambda in deciding between the lysogenic and lytic responses.

As a result of the general principles mentioned above, we have the
following questions concerning developmental systems. What kinds of
genes and gene products are involved? How is signaling accomplished?
Are  there  cascades  of  regulation  so  that  subdivisions  are  generated
within an embryo? Are multiple gradients used in some decision proc-
esses so as to make sharp boundaries? Once a cell knows where it is,
what happens next to determine its developmental fate? 

Outline of Early Drosophila Development

As in the development of spores of yeast, a single diploid cell in the ovary
of a female fly gives rise to a number of haploid cells. In Drosophila the
precursor cell undergoes four divisions to yield sixteen cells (Fig. 17.5).
These are not separated, but retain communication with one another
via  cytoplasmic  bridges.  Eventually,  one  of  the  two  cells  with  four

connections to other cells moves to the end of the group and begins the
development process of generating an egg. The fifteen connected cells
assist the process and are called nurse cells. While it is developing, the
future egg cell is called an oocyte. The nurse cells absorb nutrients from
the surrounding fluid and synthesize rRNA, mRNA, and other compo-
nents. Additionally, maternal diploid cells also influence the developing
oocyte. (Fig. 17.6). These are called the follicle cells, and they surround
the nurse cells and developing oocyte. Partway through the oogenesis
pathway,  the  nurse  cells  empty  their  contents  into  the  developing
oocyte. When the maturation process is complete, the synthetic activi-
ties in the follicle cells almost ceases.

Upon fertilization, DNA synthesis begins at a high rate in the egg.
Many replication origins are utilized per chromosome so that a chro-

present, not all nuclei are in the plane of the cross section. The future egg cell
is at the far right. At a still later stage of development the egg is enlarging and
the nurse cells are found at the left.

484  Genes Regulating Development

mosome doubling can take as little as ten minutes. The original diploid
chromosome doubles ten times, then a few nuclei migrate to the poste-
rior pole of the egg where they ultimately become the  germ line cells.
The remainder of the nuclei migrate to the surface of the egg and divide
four  more times, yielding  a total  of about  4,000 nuclei. At this point
nuclear membranes and cell walls develop, creating isolated cells. This
stage consists of a single layer of cells and is called a blastula.

Up to the time of wall formation, the nuclei are not committed to any
developmental fate, for they can be moved to different locations without
altering the development of the embryo. After the walls form, the cells
are  partially  committed,  and  relocating  them  interferes  with  normal
development. About six hours after fertilization the embryo develops
about 14 distinguishable segments. Six of these ultimately fuse to yield
the head,  three become the thorax,  and about eight develop into  the
abdomen. By 24 hours after fertilization the larva is fully developed.

Classical Embryology

Early experiments in embryology indicated that long-range influences
help  determine  pattern  formation  in  embryos.  Sander  examined  the
consequences of isolating parts of the embryo by tying off portions so
as  to  prevent  chemical  communication  between  two  groups  of  cells.
Similar experiments showed that the anterior portion of the egg exerted
an influence over the pattern development in the remainder of the egg.
Material removed from the anterior pole and microinjected elsewhere
behaved as though it contained the source of the pattern maker. Also,
destroying  material  at  the  anterior  end  of  the  egg  eliminated  head
structures and yielded an embryo with a posterior replacing the head
structures.

Removal of about 10% of the cytoplasm from the anterior end of an
egg also affects the resulting pattern development. Usually the abdomi-
nal region of the resulting organism is defective. Removal of an equal
amount of  cytoplasm  from  other parts  of  the egg has relatively little
effect on the developing embryo. Dominance experiments can even be
done with microinjection. Injecting cytoplasm from the posterior region
into the anterior region suppresses head development. Similarly, ante-
rior cytoplasm taken from an embryo somewhat later in development
represses posterior development if it is injected into the posterior region.
In either case, removal of cytoplasm from one end reduces the tendency
to develop structures characteristic of that end, and injection of cyto-
plasm  from  the  other  end  of  the  embryo  can  reverse  the  identity  of
structures near the end. In this way two-headed or two-tailed embryos
can be formed.

Using Genetics to Begin Study of Developmental Systems

Although the classical experiments with insect embryos indicated the
existence of long-range effects, further progress has required new tech-
niques.  Genetic  approaches  are  one  method  for  proceeding  with  a

Using Genetics to Begin Study of Developmental Systems  485

deeper analysis of development. Mutants have the potential for indicat-
ing the complexity of a system by revealing the approximate number of
genes or gene products involved and the ways in which the system can
fail. Recently, molecular genetics has greatly streamlined the process of
obtaining and studying mutants and genes involved in the development
process.

We might expect the existence of two easily distinguishable classes
of  developmental  mutations,  maternal and  embryonic. That is, some
genes and gene products necessary for spatial development likely are
expressed  only  in  the  nurse  or  follicle  cells  and are  required  for  egg
development. Other mutations likely are embryonic and expressed only
in the developing embryo.

How can maternal lethal or embryonic lethal mutations be isolated
and studied? Certainly the technology is not as simple as mutagenizing
bacteria and providing leucine as they grow, and then identifying those
colonies that require leucine for growth. Nonetheless, the operations
are not particularly complicated either. Two problems must be solved.
The first is handling the diploid chromosomes. Most likely defects will
be  lethal.  Since  dominant  lethal  mutants  cannot  be  propagated,  the
mutants  which  can  be  propagated  and  studied  must  be  recessive.
Recessive lethals can be generated as long as the homologous chromo-
some  does  not  carry  the  mutation.  Whenever  the  mutation  is  to  be
detected or to be studied, both chromosomes must carry the mutation.
The second problem is preventing recombination between homologous

mutations. A mutagenized male is mutated with a female carrying a genetically

offspring can be easily identified and ultimately, a homozygous female can be

chromosomes. Due to the absence of the necessary mutants, this cannot
be done simply by using a recombination deficient Drosophila.

Ordinarily  at  meiosis,  extensive  pairing  and  crossing  over  occurs
between homologous chromosomes. Classical geneticists noticed, how-
ever, that if one of the chromosome pairs carries a chromosome inver-
sion,  then  pairing  between  the  two  chromosomes  is  impeded  in  the
vicinity of the inversion. Therefore recombination between a particular
pair  of  chromosomes  can  be  greatly  reduced  by  combining  multiple
inversions and rearrangements into one of the chromosome pairs. Such
a chromosome is called a balancer chromosome.

Suppose we wish to isolate mutations in chromosome III. The proc-
ess can be started by mutagenizing a male and mating with a female
carrying a normal chromosome III and a balancer chromosome III with
a dominant, easily identified marker like wing shape or bristle pattern
(Fig. 17.7). Progeny carrying the balancer will have inherited the other
copy of chromosome III from the mutagenized male. Males can be taken
from this point and used to generate females carrying the mutagenized
chromosome III. Finally, the resultant males and females carrying the
mutagenized chromosome III can be mated, and the resulting eggs or
embryos lacking the dominant markers on the balancer chromosomes
can be examined for lethality or the presence of developmental abnor-
malities. In one such screen of over 5,000 mutagenized chromosomes,
about  sixty  maternal  effect  mutations  were  found.  On  average  four
alleles of each of the fifteen genes were found. If the mutations were
randomly distributed among the relevant genes, these statistics imply
that most of the maternal effect genes had received at least one muta-
tion. That is, that there are on the order of 20 such genes. This is not far
off. Ultimately, about 30 were found.

The general conclusions from these genetic experiments are that a
relatively small number of genes are required for spatial development
in Drosophila. Many of the genes exert a strong effect over a sizeable
portion of the embryo. Three groups of maternal effect mutations have
been found: anterior, which lack head and thoracic structures; terminal,
which lack structures at both ends; and posterior, which lack posterior
structures. Among the mutations affecting anterior structures was the
mutation  known  as  bicoid.  Embryos  carrying  this  mutation  behave
similarly to embryos with their anterior cytoplasm removed. They often
lack head and thorax structures and replace them with a mirror image
of the posterior region. These defects can be complemented by microin-
jection with anterior cytoplasm from wild-type embryos. Other muta-
tions  affecting  head  and  thorax  development  are  the  swallow  and
exuperantia mutations.

Additional classes of mutations that affect embryonic pattern devel-
opment independent of maternal effects have  also been found. Some
of  these  affect  segmentation  in  the  embryo.  Mutations  in  the  gene
named fushi tarazu have too few segments. Some mutations remove the
even or the odd numbered segments, or lack a sizeable block of segments
or have segments or regions duplicated.

Cloning Developmental Genes  487

Developmental genes also act after segmentation. The identities of
the  segments  are  determined  by  homeotic  genes.  For  example,  the
Antennapedia  complex  of  genes  specifies  development  of  part  of  the
thorax,  and  mutants  in  this  complex  may  grow  legs  from  the  head
instead of antennae. The bithorax cluster of homeotic genes studied by
Lewis  specifies  identity  of  the  posterior  portion  of  the  thorax  and
abdomen.

Cloning Developmental Genes

Clones of developmental genes are required for many studies. As in any
research, the techniques devised for the studies and the results obtained
greatly aided later and similar efforts. The only information available
to  assist cloning  a  developmental  gene  the  first  time was  the  known
chromosomal location of the gene. Such genes could be mapped both
genetically and cytologically. The cytological mapping utilized the char-
acteristic  banding  pattern  seen  in  the  polytene  chromosomes  from
Drosophila salivary glands and the existence of deletions and inversions
affecting a developmental complex like bithorax.

Cloning  of  bithorax  by Bender  began with a collection  of random
Drosophila clones. These could be located approximately on the Droso-
phila chromosomes by in situ hybridization. Then a chromosomal walk
was done to reach the gene complex. One of the major problems with
walking along a chromosome is knowing when you get to your gene.
Sometimes deletions will delineate a gene. Inversions that inactivate the
desired gene are better, however. The end points are easy to locate in a
walk and they must lie within or very near the gene. 

One  approach  to  complete  the  identification  of  a  clone  is  to  seek
RNAs to which the cloned DNA hybridizes. Hybridizations of radioac-
tive DNA from candidate clones to mRNA can be done in situ to slices
of  embryos  or  even  adult  flies  to  identify  any  RNAs  with  expression
patterns suggestive of developmental genes. Once a candidate RNA can
be detected, RNA extracted at the appropriate time from embryos of the
the right tissue can be used to make a cDNA library that is then screened
with the cloned DNA. In the case of Antennapedia, the probe to the gene
hybridized not only to the gene, but also to another region of the same
chromosome,  a  region  containing  the  bithorax  developmental  gene
complex.

Enhancer Traps for Detecting and Cloning Developmental Genes

Molecular genetics provides a streamlined method for the detection of
developmentally regulated genes in Drosophila. This regulation can be
either  with  respect  to  time  or  with  respect  to  position  of  the  cell.  A
segment of DNA containing an enhancerless promoter connected to a
β-galactosidase gene is inserted into the genome at random locations.
Only if the inserted DNA falls near an enhancer will the promoter be
activated and will β-galactosidase be synthesized. If the enhancer regu-
lates a developmental gene, then the pattern of β-galactosidase synthesis

will similarly be developmentally regulated. As a result, the pattern in
space  or  time  of  β-galactosidase  synthesis  will  be  the  same  as  that
normally followed by the gene under influence of the enhancer. This
pattern can be visualized by immersing the embryos in a substrate like
X-gal whose product after cleavage by β-galactosidase is insoluble and
highly colored.

Once  an  insertion  of  interest  has  been  found,  subsequent  cloning
steps can proceed efficiently. If the inserted DNA is a complete E. coli
vector and lacks a particular restriction enzyme cleavage site, then a
clone  can  simply    be  made  containing  DNA  from  either  side  of  the
insertion. DNA from the insertion strain is cleaved with the enzyme,
circularized, and transformed into E. coli. Since the cleavage will occur
only in the Drosophila DNA, such DNA will flank the vector sequences,
and the recircularized vector will contain some surrounding DNA (Fig.
17.8). Once this has been accomplished, a cDNA library can be screened
for sequences also contained on the clone from the enhancer trap. Any
such sequences that are expressed with the same pattern as the original
β-galactosidase expression pattern are good candidates for developmen-
tally regulated genes.

Expression Patterns of Developmental Genes

How can it be demonstrated that a developmental gene actually does
encode a protein and that the protein is involved in development? Many
developmental genes look like they code for proteins. The bithorax gene
complex  of  Drosophila  helps  specify  identities  of  segments  from  the
second  thoracic  to  the  eighth  abdominal  segment.  The  Ultrabithorax
region within the bithorax complex generates a number of transcripts
from a very large region containing a few exons and large introns (Fig.
17.9). The 5’ exon contains a substantial open reading frame and looks
like it codes for a protein.

Antibodies against the presumed ultrabithorax protein, if they could
be made, would provide proof that the gene encodes a protein. They
would  also  provide  the  basis  of  an  assay  for  the  presence  of  such  a
protein so that it could be purified. The traditional approach of purify-
ing a protein and injecting it into a mouse or rabbit could hardly be used
for a protein that cannot be assayed and hasn’t been purified. Molecular
genetics techniques provided inexpensive solutions to the problem of
purifying the protein, making useful antibodies, and locating the protein
within  the  developing  larva.  A  cloning  vector  was  used  from  which
β-galactosidase could be synthesized in E. coli only if DNA containing
an  open  reading  frame  were  inserted  upstream  of  the  enzyme  (Fig.
17.10). Thus Lac+ colonies were selected from cells transformed with a
plasmid into which fragments of the 5’ exon had been ligated. These
would synthesize the Ubx-β-galactosidase fusion protein, and further-
more, because of the size of the protein, it could easily be isolated from

reading frame can be restored and cells containing the vector will be Lac + if a
third segment of DNA is added which restores the correct reading frame and
which contains no translation termination codons.

SDS  protein  gels.  β-galactosidase  is  one  of  the  largest  polypeptides
synthesized in E. coli, and the fusion protein likely would be even larger.
Hence the fusion protein could be separated from other proteins simply
by electrophoresis. The region of the gel containing the fusion protein
was cut out, protein eluted, and injected into rabbits or mice for direct
induction of antibodies or for production of monoclonal antibodies.

The resulting antibodies against a portion of the homeotic protein
permitted  assay  of  the  developing  fly  for  the  protein’s  location  and
timing of synthesis. Not surprisingly, immunofluorescence shows that
the homeotic protein is found in the nuclei of cells, suggesting that it is
a DNA-binding protein. It is found in restricted parts of the embryo.

In general, in studying developmental genes, two variables must be
examined, the RNA and the protein product. We would like to know
when  the  mRNA  is  synthesized  and  where,  and  when  the  RNA  is
translated  and  where  the  protein  product  goes.  Questions  about  the
RNA  product  can  be  answered  with  in  situ  RNA-DNA  hybridization
between slices of embryo and radioactive DNA. The protein products
can be located with similar in situ probing by using antibodies directed
against  the  protein  in  question.  The  antibodies  can  be  obtained  as
outlined above or by injecting rabbits with synthetic polypeptides based
on DNA sequences in the developmental genes.

As might be expected, the patterns of RNA and protein synthesis from
different developmental genes roughly parallel their effects on embryos.
For  example,  the  products  of  genes  effecting  segmentation  are often
expressed in stripes across the embryo (Fig. 17.11). Most of the proteins
are found in the nuclei, implying that many of the proteins regulate gene
expression  directly  by  binding  to  DNA.  Of  course  for  developmental
proteins expressed after cell walls have formed, we would expect to find
developmental  genes  coding  for  secreted  proteins,  membrane-bound
receptors, and proteins involved in regulation cascades linking mem-
brane receptors to gene activity in the nucleus. An example of such a
system is the G-protein protein kinase pathway.

Not all proteins used early in development look like they bind to DNA.
One such example is the product of the vasa gene. This is a maternal
effect gene that is expressed only in nurse cells. It has a sequence with
about  24%  amino  acid  identity  to  the  translation  initiation  factor
eIF-4A,  which  in  combination  with  4B  and  4F  recognizes  the  cap
structures on mRNA.

Similarities Among Developmental Genes  491

The  bicoid  mRNA  and  protein  appears  in  a  particularly  pleasing
pattern. Bicoid mRNA is synthesized in the nurse cells and transferred
to the oocyte during oogenesis. This RNA binds just inside the oocyte at
the extreme anterior end by means of the swallow and exuperantia gene
products. The bicoid mRNA is not translated until the egg is fertilized.
This is a marvelous way for the egg to generate a gradient in the protein
just at the time it is needed. The egg can sit for a long time and diffusion
cannot destroy the gradient. These results are also consistent with the
microinjection results.

Similarities Among Developmental Genes

The sequences of the fushi tarazu and Antennapedia genes revealed that
they encoded protein, and more importantly, that over a stretch of about
60 amino acid residues, the sequences of the two proteins were even
more highly conserved than the corresponding coding DNA sequences.
A portion of another homeotic developmental gene complex, bithorax,
also possessed a closely related sequence. This sequence is now called
a  homeo  box.  With  the  conservation  of  the  homeo box  among three
proteins, it seemed likely to be present in other developmental regula-
tors from the fly as well as in closely related organisms. This proved to
be true. Not only do other species of Drosophila contain homeo boxes;
so  do  all  higher  organisms,  including  humans.  Typically  a  Southern
transfer of genomic DNA hybridized to a homeo sequence reveals five
to ten similar sequences. If hybridization at low stringency is performed,
less closely related sequences are revealed. These have been cloned and
sequenced, yielding the expected more variable homeo-like sequences.
Such sequences can be used again to find still less closely related genes.
Many organisms possess multiple clusters of four or five homeo box
proteins. 

Homeo boxes were also noticed to be similar to the alpha mating-type
factors of yeast which were known to bind to DNA. Therefore it seemed
likely that proteins containing a homeo-box sequence bind to DNA. This
is true.  Homeo-box domains bind DNA, and the structure of several has
been determined. The homeo-box fits into the major groove of the DNA,
but its positioning is notably different from that of the helix-turn-helix
motif. Not all developmental genes possess homeo boxes. A number of
other DNA-binding motifs are utilized, including zinc finger, zinc do-
mains, helix-loop-helix proteins and others.

Overall Model of Drosophila Early Development 

From knowledge of developmental genes and their expression patterns,
we can form a rough picture of Drosophila development. Initially two
gradients  are  set  up.  The  anterior  gradient  in  the  bicoid  product  is
generated  by  activating  bicoid  mRNA  for  translation  at  the  time  of
fertilization. A posterior morphogen is also utilized. This is the nanos
product, which is located in the rear half of the egg. Next the develop-
mental genes responsible for sizeable portions of the embryo are acti-

492  Genes Regulating Development

vated.  Hunchback,  krüppel,  and  knirps  are  examples  of  such  genes.
Defects in these genes lead to sizeable gaps in the shapes of developing
embryos. The concentrations of bicoid and nanos regulate the expres-
sion  of  these  proteins. Likely they  are  synthesized only in  regions in
which proteins lie in certain concentration ranges. Next, the  pair rule
genes function. These eight or so genes further subdivide the developing
embryo into six to eight stripes. A gene like engrailed helps sharpen the
boundaries between the segments. After this, the runt and hairy genes
are expressed in alternate stripes. The homeotic genes then function to
specify the actual identity of the different areas.

17.1 How would you seek maternal lethal mutations, that is, muta-

tions rendering females unable to lay fertile eggs?

17.2. What is the likely appearance of embryos containing the swal-

low or exuperantia mutations?

17.3. Suppose a gradient from one end of a Drosophila egg to the other
exists in the concentration of a protein of 50,000 molecular weight. How
long would be required for diffusion to flatten significantly, say by a
factor of two or three, the gradient in concentration?

17.4. Illustrate how an appropriate deletion will permit a time-saving
jump to be made when cloning a gene by walking along a chromosome.
17.5. What sort of sequence drift between two genes could indicate
that evolution was conserving the protein sequence and not the DNA
sequence?

17.6. In the study of embryonic and maternal lethals, why couldn’t
both  males  and  females  be  taken  from  the  cross  between  the  mu-
tagenized  males  and  females  carrying  the  marked  balancer  chromo-
some? It would seem that males and females taken at this point could
be crossed, thereby eliminating one of the crosses necessary in generat-
ing homozygous individuals.

17.7 If  you  were  seeking  developmental  mutants  in  Drosophila lo-
cated on an autosomal chromosome, why would it be a poor idea to
design  the  search  such  that  the  mutations  you  preserved  would  be
located on the balancer chromosome?

Lambda Phage
Integration and Excision

18

This chapter discusses lambda phage DNA integration into and excision
from  the  bacterial  chromosome.  Integrated  phage  are  often  called
prophage because, although they are not expressing most of their genes,
they  have  the  capability  of  producing  phage  upon  induction.  Early
studies had suggested that the DNA of a prophage might be associated
with the chromosome in a specific location, but the idea of integration
rather than some other form of attachment was hard to accept because
it seemed too dangerous biologically, and too difficult biochemically for
specific pieces of DNA to be cut and rejoined. Now, of course, having
seen the typical reactions utilized in genetic engineering, these concepts
are familiar, and we can focus on the aspects yet to be understood. In
retrospect,  we  might  have  expected  that  chromosomes  were  not  un-
changing  since  long  before  study  of  phage  lambda  began,  classical
geneticists had observed that DNA segments of the Drosophila chromo-
some generated by X-rays reintegrated so as to generate chromosomal
rearrangements.

In addition to this chapter on lambda phage integration, two other
chapters also cover topics related to site-specific genetic recombination.
The recombination processes to be discussed require special proteins
or enzymes and usually involve a special DNA site on at least one of the
participating DNA molecules. Later we will cover other DNA segments
that integrate  into  or  excise from the chromosome. One  of the most
striking  findings  about  these  integrating  sequences,  now  called
transposons, is that they are ubiquitous. They have been found in all
organisms that have been carefully examined. The final chapter of the
three treats the generation of diversity of binding specificities in anti-
body  molecules.  In  part  this  is  accomplished  by  shuffling  DNA  se-

497

quences within the chromosomes of cells in the immune system. Hence,
in  contrast  to  transposons,  which  can  be  viewed  as  parasites,  the
moveable  DNA  sequences  may  also  be  of  great  positive  value  to  an
organism.

Mapping Integrated Lambda

How do we know lambda phage associates with the chromosome when
it lysogenizes a cell? Lambda lysogens could possess copies of the phage
DNA freely floating in the cytoplasm. A problem generated by this mode
of  existence  is  that  the  molecules  would  be  randomly  inherited  by
daughter cells on division. As a result, the lower the average number of
lambda  molecules  per  cell,  the  higher  the  fraction  of  daughters  that
might fail to inherit any and therefore become nonlysogenic. To explain
lambda’s low rate of spontaneously becoming nonlysogenic, which is
about 10-6 per doubling, cells would have to possess unacceptably large
numbers  of  the  phage  genomes.  A  second  method  to  ensure  proper
inheritance of lysogeny would be for a nonintegrated lambda to possess
a  special  segregation  mechanism.  Several  genetic  elements  use  this
mechanism for stable inheritance. These include the phage P1 and the
F factor, both of which have been discussed earlier in other contexts.
This mechanism does not require large numbers of the lambda genome
to be present. The third and simplest segregation mechanism would be
for lambda to attach to or integrate into the host chromosome. Then it
would be replicated and segregated into daughter cells with the host
chromosomes.

Elegant genetic experiments showed not only that lambda associates
with the chromosome but that it associates with a specific site on the
chromosome. Now, of course, a simple Southern transfer experiment
could settle the issue. The original data suggesting that the lambda DNA

was associated with a particular region of the chromosome came from
mating experiments between lysogenic male bacteria and nonlysogenic
female bacteria.

Transfer of genetic markers (see Chapter 8) lying between the origin
of transfer and the gal region showed no differences between lysogenic
and nonlysogenic males. The frequency of female recombinants incor-
porating  genetic  markers  transferred  after  the  gal  genes,  however,
revealed a discrepancy (Fig. 18.1). Their frequency was much lower if
the DNA was transferred from lysogenic males than if the DNA came
from nonlysogenic males. This can be understood as follows: if lambda
is attached to the host genome in the vicinity of gal, then when it enters
a nonlysogenic female, it finds itself in an environment lacking lambda
repressor. As a result, the phage induces and proceeds through a lytic
cycle  analogous to infecting  a  cell.  This process  of a  phage inducing
upon its transfer into a nonlysogenic female is called zygotic induction.
Its parallel for the lac operon leads to temporary induction of the lacZYA
genes upon their introduction into cells deleted of the operon. Later as
lac repressor accumulates, transcription of the genes shuts off.

A minor paradox is raised by the lambda results discussed above. The
DNA is transferred to females in a linear fashion beginning at a particu-
lar point. Therefore it would seem that if a genetic marker lying ahead
of the integrated lambda were transferred to females, the lambda itself
eventually would also be transferred. Why are such cells not killed by
zygotic induction?

The resolution to the paradox is that the majority of recipient cells
that receive a gal-proximal marker also do not also receive gal. The DNA
strand being transferred frequently breaks and conjugation stops. Even
though  genetic  markers  lying  near  the  origin are  transferred at high
efficiency, markers lying farther away, and therefore transferred later
in the mating process, are transferred with substantially lower efficien-
cies. Consequently, most cells receiving a marker proximal to lambda
or gal never receive lambda or gal; so zygotic induction occurs in only
a tiny fraction of the cells that receive markers transferred before gal.

Simultaneous Deletion of Chromosomal and Lambda DNA

The  simplest  method  for  attaching  lambda  to  the  host  chromosome
would be to insert it directly into the DNA. The simplest ideas are not
always  correct,  however,  and  in  the  mid-60s  when  the  question  was
being considered, chromosomal DNA seemed sacrosanct. Experiments
were  designed  to  determine  whether  lambda  did  integrate  into  the
chromosome or whether it merely was stuck onto a special place on the
chromosome. The genetic demonstration of lambda’s insertion into the
host  chromosome  utilized  deletions.  The  conclusion  would  be  that
lambda is integrated into the chromosome if a deletion of host genes

Often the identification of deletions is difficult. In this case, however,
their identification and isolation were easy. The nitrate reductase com-

oxygen. This enzyme complex is not entirely specific, and it will reduce
chlorate as well. The product, chlorite, however, is toxic. Such a situ-
ation is a geneticist’s dream, for then mutants that are not killed by the
chlorate can easily be isolated. These mutants have lost the ability to
reduce chlorate, and many have been deleted of part or all of the nitrate
reductase genes. Although it would be appropriate to name the genes
involved  after  nitrate,  the  genetic  locus  is  frequently  called  chl  for
chlorate resistance.

The deletions in the various chl loci frequently extend into adjacent
genes. If chlorate-resistant mutants are isolated in a lambda lysogen, a
few are found to be deletions and some of these are missing some but
not all lambda genes. The pattern of lambda genes remaining or deleted
is always consistent with the lambda genome being linearly incorpo-
rated into the chromosome in a specific orientation with respect to the
flanking  genes  (Fig.  18.2).  If  some  of  the  lambda  genes  have  been
deleted, how does one show that some lambda genes remain? The cell
certainly  cannot  produce  infective  lambda.  A  method  called  marker
rescue answers the question. Suppose we wish to test whether a lysogen
with a deletion still has an intact J gene. A lawn of these cells is poured
in soft agar on a plate and a small volume of a λimm434susJ (nonsense
mutation in J) stock is spotted onto the lawn. Being heteroimmune, the
superinfecting phage is not repressed even if the deleted lysogen still
possesses  immunity.  A  few  of  these  infecting  phage  exchange  their
defective J gene by recombination for the good one from what remains
of the partially deleted lysogenic lambda. Sufficient phage make this
replacement, that cycles of growth, lysis, and infection of surrounding
cells produces a turbid spot on the opaque lawn. If no J gene is present
on the partially deleted chromosome, the infecting λimm434susJ cannot
proceed through multiple growth cycles, and the lawn is unperturbed.
In some cases, a gene on the partially deleted lysogen will be able to
complement the superinfecting phage as well as recombine with it, but
the mapping results are unaltered. Only if the gene is present in the host
cells can the superinfecting phage grow.

DNA Heteroduplexes Prove that Lambda Integrates  501

Marker rescue experiments on chl deletions revealed many deletions
that  extended  only  part  way  into  the  lambda  genes.  Certainly  the
simplest explanation for this result is that the DNA of lambda is con-
tiguous with the host DNA.

DNA Heteroduplexes Prove that Lambda Integrates

Davidson and Sharp directly demonstrated the insertion of lambda DNA
into  the  genome  using  electron  microscopy.  They  used  a  procedure
developed to examine sequence homologies between strands from dif-
ferent DNA molecules. After denaturation to separate strands of the two
input DNA populations, the strands are allowed to anneal. Then the DNA
is  mixed  with  a  cytochrome  C  solution  to  coat  the  molecules  and
increase their diameter as well as improve their staining properties. To
spread out the long, snarled DNA molecules, a small volume of the DNA
plus cytochrome C is layered on top of a buffer. As the protein spreads
and forms a monolayer, the DNA molecules are stretched out and can
then  be  picked  up  on  an  electron-transparent  support  and  stained.
Single- and double-stranded DNA visualized by this procedure are easily
distinguished because single-stranded DNA is more flexible and there-
fore curlier than double-stranded DNA.

When  two  homologous  DNA  strands  reanneal,  a  simple  double-
stranded molecule results. A heteroduplex between a strand deleted of
a stretch of sequence generates a single-stranded “bush” on the other
strand,  and  if  the  two  strands  possess  a  stretch  of  sequence  without
homology, a “bubble” is formed. The heteroduplexes formed between
an F’-factor containing an integrated lambda genome and lambda DNA
showed the structure expected if lambda were to insert itself into the
chromosome (see problem 18.4).

permutation of the order found by recombination frequencies between
genes for vegetatively growing lambda (Fig. 18.3). On the basis of a small
number of genetic experiments Campbell proposed a brilliant explana-
tion for the gene order problem and also made several other predictions
concerning problems on integration. The Campbell model was that the
lambda DNA, which is linear within the virion, circularizes upon enter-
ing a cell and then opens its genome at another point as it reciprocally
recombines via a site-specific recombination event mediated by a spe-
cialized  recombination  machinery  into  the  chromosome  of  the  host
(Fig.  18.4).  A  simple  notation  has  developed  for  the  DNA  elements
involved in integration and excision. The region of the host DNA into
which lambda inserts is labeled BOB’. B denotes the left portion of the
bacterial sequence into which lambda inserts, O is the crossover point
or region of the recombination between phage and chromosomal DNA,
and B’ is the right portion of the bacterial sequence. The entire region
BOB’ is called attB. Similarly, the phage regions are called POP’ and attP.
The products of integration are BOP’, which is also called attL, and POB’,
which  is  called  attR.  Note  that  this  notation  does  not  prejudice  the
discussion by assuming that B and P are homologous or that B is the
same as B’. In fact, we can predict that the system would not depend on
lengthy  homologies  between  BOB’  and  POP’  because  if  it  were,  the
general recombination system could then recombine to insert or excise
a phage genome.

Isolation of Integration-Defective Mutants  503

Isolation of Integration-Defective Mutants

A  regulated  BOB’-POP’-specific  recombination  system  would  solve
lambda’s problem of restricting integration and excision reactions to
the  right  time  and  right  sites  on  the  phage  and  host  genomes.  That
lambda possesses such a recombination system could be proven by the
isolation of lambda mutants unable to lysogenize due to the absence of
an integration enzyme. The main difficulty in such a proof is a common
problem in genetics—that of identifying the desired mutant.

At the time that integration mutants were being sought, a lambda
mutant  was  already  known  that  permitted  good  guesses  to  be  made
about the properties of the desired integration-defective mutants. The
lambda mutation deletes the phage b2 region. It extends into the POP’
region and leaves the phage deficient in its integration abilities. Most of
the λb2 phage that infect cells without lysing them establish repression
but do not integrate into the chromosome. They therefore form turbid
plaques similar to those of wild-type lambda. If cells from the turbid
center of such a plaque are streaked on solidified medium and allowed
to proceed through additional generations of growth in the absence of
superinfecting phage, the λb2 are diluted away since they do not repli-
cate by their own ori, and they are not integrated into the chromosome
to be replicated by the host. Therefore the resultant cells are nonlyso-
genic. 

When λb2 phage and wild-type λ coinfect cells, the wild-type λ cannot
complement the defect in the λb2. This shows that the defect in λb2 is
in a site required for the integration, and not in a protein that can act
in trans. Even so, the λb2 provide a good indication of the behavior to
be  expected  of  mutants  defective  in  any  phage-encoded  proteins  re-
quired  for  integration.  Mutants  defective  in  the  ability  to  integrate
should form turbid plaques but not stably integrate. They could have
mutations in phage proteins required for the process of integration or
mutations  in  the DNA sites directly  used in  integration. Because  the
number of nucleotides in the DNA sites ought to be much smaller than
the coding region for the integration proteins, the majority of integra-
tion-defective mutants isolated ought to be in the integration proteins.
The  two  steps  of  growing  cells  to  dilute  away  the  nonintegrated
lambda and testing for lambda immunity can be combined. The candi-
date cells are streaked on plates containing the pH indicators eosine
yellow and methylene blue as  well as having about 107 λCI- mutants
spread on the surface. The cells spread on the plate grow, divide, and
occasionally encounter a λCI-. If a cell infected by a λCI- particle does
not possess lambda immunity, the infecting phage is not repressed, and
it grows and lyses the cell. This releases some acid and changes the color
of the pH indicators. Adjacent cells may also be infected and lysed, but
because the colony stops growing before all cells can be lysed, some cells
remain in the colony. A colony of nonlysogenic cells spotted on these
plates therefore grows into a ragged, purple colony, whereas colonies
of immune cells yield smooth, pink colonies.

504  Lambda Phage Integration and Excision

A brute-force pick-and-spot technique based on the knowledge of the
behavior of λb2 mutants on the indicating plates permitted the isolation
of lambda mutants unable to lysogenize. These are called int mutants.
Some of them were nonsense mutants, proving that the phage encodes
a protein that is required for integration.

Isolation of Excision-Deficient Mutants

As expected, the int mutants can be helped to lysogenize by complemen-
tation. Not surprisingly, these mutants are also found to excise poorly
without  assistance.  Hence  Int  protein  is  also  required  for  excision.
Although it would seem that the process of integration should be readily
reversible  with  the  same  components  that  are  used  for  integration,
surprisingly, a phage-encoded protein is required for excision but not
integration.

A phenomenon known as heteroimmune curing forms the basis of a
simple demonstration that excision requires a protein in addition to Int
protein. If lambda lysogens are infected with a heteroimmune phage
like λimm434, most cells are lysed, but many of the survivors are found

λ

imm 434    +   Lysogen

Some nonlysogens

to have been cured of the lambda. This is called superinfection curing.
Apparently the superinfecting heteroimmune phage provides diffusible
products  that  facilitate  excision  of  the  prophage.  Some  Int+ deletion
phage,  but  not  others,  can  promote  curing  when  they  superinfect
lysogens  of  different  immunity.  Thus  something  in  addition  to  Int
protein must be involved in excision.

The isolation of a nonsense mutation in the gene required for excision
proved that it coded for a protein. This isolation used heat-pulse curing.
If a lysogen of λCI857 growing at 32° is heated to 42° for five minutes and
then grown at 32°, the heat-sensitive CI857 repressor is first denatured,
and phage growth begins. Then, after the cells are cooled to 32°, the
repressor renatures and further phage development ceases before suf-
ficient  phage products have  accumulated  to  kill  the  cells. In the five
minutes of derepression however, sufficient phage proteins are synthe-
sized that lambda can excise from the chromosome. After further cell
growth, the excised lambda genome is diluted away, and daughter cells
that are cured of lambda appear at high frequency.

Heat-pulse curing was used to isolate excision-defective mutants in
the following way (Fig. 18.5). A mutagenized stock of λCI857 was used
to lysogenize cells. This step selected for phage retaining the ability to
lysogenize. The lysogenic cells resulting from this step were grown at
32° and then replicated onto three petri plates. One was incubated at
32°, one was incubated at 42°, and the third was incubated at 42° for
five minutes, at 32° for two hours, and then at 42° overnight.

The first plate kept viable copies of all the colonies. The second plate
showed which colonies  were  infected  with  lambda, as growth at  42°

would induce the phage and kill lysogens. Growth on the third plate
indicated  which  colonies  could  heat-pulse  cure.  On  this  plate,  the
lambda lysogens would heat-pulse cure, and the cured cells in such a
colony would be capable of growing into colonies during the subsequent
growth  at  42°.  Any  colony  whose  cells  possessed  excision-defective
phage could not heat-pulse cure and would therefore be killed by the
attempted  growth  of  the  unexcised  prophage  during  the  subsequent
extended exposure to 42°.

Later, a simpler method for detecting excision-defective mutants was
devised. This scheme uses cells in which lambda has mistakenly inte-
grated into a site within the gal genes that resembles the authentic attB
site. The cells are Gal- as a result. Infection of these cells by heteroim-
mune  phage  able  to  provide  Int  and  Xis  proteins  in  trans  catalyzes
excision of the phage from the gal genes, and the cells become Gal+. If
such  infected  cells  are  plated  on  galactose  plates,  plaques  with  Gal+
revertants are red on medium containing galactose indicator dye and
Gal- plaques are white. With this convenient assay, the excision abilities
of many different phage can be assayed on a single galactose indicator
plate.

Using the plate assay for excision, Enquist and Weisberg performed
a  thorough  genetic  analysis  of  the  att-int-xis  region  of  the  lambda
chromosome. They isolated and characterized hundreds of int and xis
point mutations. The mutations fell into two complementation groups
indicating that two genes were involved. One codes for the Int protein
and one for the Xis protein. The mutations were mapped with a set of
deletions ending in the region. The large number of mutants studied
permitted a reasonable estimation of the sizes of the genes. The int gene
appeared to be about 1,240 base pairs long, and the xis gene was very
small, only 110  base  pairs  long. No additional phage genes acting in
trans and directly involved in the integration or excision process were
discovered.

506  Lambda Phage Integration and Excision

Properties of the int and xis Gene Products

How  many  phage-encoded  proteins  are  required  for  integration  and
excision? If Int and Xis proteins will function in trans, then complemen-
tation tests can be performed to determine the number of int genes and
the number of xis genes carried on the phage. Experiments showed that
the Int protein of one phage will indeed help another phage integrate,

Int and xis mutations are not complemented by most phage other

do not complement lambda int or xis mutants. Thus, int and xis can be
phage-specific.

Incorrect Excision and gal and bio Transducing Phage

Lambda phage can act as a specialized transducer of certain host genes.
This means that each phage particle in some lambda lines carries a host
gene in addition to essential phage genes. The host gene on the phage
DNA  can  be  brought  into  an  infected  cell  and  either  complement  a
defective copy of a gene in the host or can recombine with the host copy
of the gene. The process of carrying the DNA across and incorporating
it  into  the  chromosome  of  the  infected  cell  is  called  transduction.
Because only certain genes can be transduced by lambda, and because
each phage particle in a lysate of a transducing phage carries a copy of
the host gene, the process is called specialized transduction. Specialized
transduction by lambda should be contrasted to generalized transduc-
tion by P1 in which only a small fraction of the phage particles contain

Incorrect Excision and gal and bio Transducing Phage  507

nonphage  DNA,  only  a  small  fraction  of  these  contain  DNA  of  any
particular bacterial gene, and the DNA in a transducing particle con-
tains no phage DNA.

Transducing  phage  once  were  necessary  for  the  enrichment  and
ultimate isolation of regions of DNA involved in regulation of bacterial
genes. Also, cells infected with transducing phage often hypersynthesize
the  proteins  they  encode  owing  to  the  presence  of  multiple  phage
genomes  during  much  of the  phage growth  cycle.  Without this  gene
dosage effect, the proteins could be present in quantities too low for
biochemical  study.  The  enormous  value  of  transducing  phage  in  re-
search on bacterial gene regulation stimulated efforts to develop genetic
engineering  techniques  so  that  DNA,  proteins,  and  gene  regulation
systems from other organisms could also be studied.

Upon induction of a lysogen, most prophage excise uneventfully. At
a frequency of 10-5 to 10-7, however, a prophage excises incorrectly from
the host chromosome and picks up bacterial DNA bordering the phage
integration site. These incorrect excision events produce transducing
phage. One of the joys and powers of genetics research is that excep-
tionally rare events such as these may be captured and perpetuated for
further study.

508  Lambda Phage Integration and Excision

When lambda excises incorrectly from a point other than BOP’ and
POB’, bacterial DNA on one side or the other of the integrated lambda
DNA can be picked up by the phage (Fig. 18.6).  These incorrect excision
events could utilize the int and xis products, but more likely use cellular
enzymes that break and rejoin DNA. If the crossover sites are not too
far  apart  for  the  intervening  DNA  to  fit  within  the  phage  head,  the
resulting  DNA  can  be  encapsidated  to  form  a  viable  phage  particle.
Usually, for packaging to occur some phage genes must be deleted from
the resulting excision product. Looping out to the left produces a phage
with gal genes substituting for the b2 region. That is, gal DNA in the
phage is flanked on both sides by lambda genes. Also,  attL, or BOP’,
replaces the normal phage attachment region POP’.

The gal genes are sufficiently far from attλ that phage having picked
up gal genes must, of necessity, have left at least the J gene behind in
order that the transducing phage genome be small enough to be pack-
aged in a lambda coat. These phage are defective because they do not
yield  viable  phage  upon  infection  of  cells.  They  are  propagated  by
coinfecting them with phage that provide their missing J gene product.
Such defective gal transducing phage are called λdgal.

Phage  that  excise  the  other  way  pick  up  the  biotin  genes.  These
substitute  for  the  nonessential  int,  xis,  and  other  early  genes  under
control of pL. Usually these phage are not defective and hence are called
λpbio for their ability to form plaques and transduce biotin genes. They
possess attR, POB’.

Transducing Phage Carrying Genes Other than gal and bio

Isolation  of  gal  or  bio  transducing  phage  is  straightforward  because
these genes flank the lambda attachment site. For genes located farther
away,  a  simple  improper  excision  event  cannot  produce  transducing
phage. Genes located perhaps as far as a minute away on the genetic
map, about 40,000 base pairs, from an integrated phage can be picked
up by a combination of a deletion of the intervening DNA followed by
an improper excision event. In this case the combined probabilities for
such a double event are so low that large cell cultures must be used to
find the transducing phage. What can be done to isolate phage that carry
genes located more than a minute from attB of lambda? 

Two  approaches  were  used  to  bring  an  integrated  phage  and  a
particular gene close enough together to permit generation of transduc-
ing  phage.  Either  the  gene  was  moved  close  to  the  integrated  phage
genome or the phage was moved close to the gene. The phage can be
brought near the gene by selecting for lysogens following infection of a
host deleted of the phage attachment region attB. At very low but usable
frequencies,  lambda  will  then  integrate  into  sites  that  possess  some
similarity to the normal chromosomal integration site. These secondary
integration  sites  are  so  widely  scattered  over  the  chromosome  that
lambda can be forced, albeit at very low frequencies, to integrate into
or adjacent to most genes. Either the desired integrant can be selected
by genetic means or the entire population of cells with phage integrated

Use of Transducing Phage to Study Integration and Excision  509

at many different sites can be used as a source of phage. Some of the
phage  will  excise  incorrectly  from  their  abnormal  positions  and
transduce the desired adjacent bacterial genes. The second method of
forcing an integrated phage to be near a target gene is to select for the
illegitimate recombinational insertion of an episome carrying the gene
into a site adjacent to the prophage.

Use of Transducing Phage to Study Integration and Excision

One use of transducing phage is to demonstrate that lambda normally
integrates and excises at precisely the same point. Of course, lambda
can be integrated and excised many times from the bacterial att region,
and  the  region  apparently  suffers  no  harm.  Nonetheless,  how do we
know, without sequencing, that bases are not inserted or deleted in the
process? The integration of lambda into secondary att sites provided the
proof that, as far as the sequence of the host chromosome is concerned,
excision is the exact opposite of integration.

When lambda integrates into a secondary att site, the gene into which
lambda has inserted is disrupted and therefore inactivated, but when
the lambda is induced and excises from these sites, the majority of the
surviving  cells  possess  a  perfectly  normal  gene.  Few  of  the  lambda
improperly excise and produce transducing phage as described in the
previous section. That is, except for the products of the rare improper
excision events, no nucleotides are inserted or deleted at the pseudo att
site. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the integration and excision
cycle at the normal att site similarly does not alter its sequence. For
example, one site for secondary lambda integration is a gene coding for
a protein required for proline synthesis. The insertion of lambda makes
the cells Pro-, but heat-pulse curing leaves the cells Pro+ (Fig. 18.7).

510  Lambda Phage Integration and Excision

A second use of transducing phage is in the study of the biochemistry
of the integration and excision reactions themselves. These site-specific
recombination events take place at the att regions, but the partners need
not be confined  to  a  phage and  host  chromosome.  For example,  the
enzymatic equivalent of an excision reaction can be performed between
λdgal and a λpbio to form a λ and a λdgal-bio. To detect these recombi-
nation products, the input phage must be genetically marked. This can
be  done  by  using  nonsense  mutations  located  in  the  A  and  R genes,
which  are  at  opposite  ends  of  the  lambda  DNA.  The  cross  might
therefore be between λdgalA-R+ and λpbioA+R-; the frequency of genera-
tion of wild-type lambda, those able to form plaques on su- cells, could

be measured. Crosses between all combinations of att regions can be
performed  by  similar  approaches.  The  main  results  of  such  studies
examining the site-specific recombination events catalyzed by Int and
Xis proteins are that all combinations of att regions will recombine, but
at  different  rates,  and  that  the  Xis  protein  is  required  only  for  the
excision type of reaction.

The Double att Phage, att2

The preceding sections have described a little of what has been learned
from genetic experiments about lambda’s ability to integrate and excise.
One  way  to  study  the  biochemistry  of  integration  and  excision  is  to
construct an in vitro system that mimics the  in vivo reaction. The first
requirement for integration or excision is to bring the two participating
molecules close together. In vivo, this requirement is partially met as a
simple consequence of the fact that both DNA molecules are confined
to the volume of the cell and therefore are held in close proximity. The
in vitro integration or excision reaction should be greatly speeded if the
two att regions similarly can be forced close to one another. One way to
accomplish this is to place both att sites on the same DNA molecule.
Then the concentration of one att site in the vicinity of the other is, of
necessity, high.

This section describes the isolation and properties of such a double
att phage, and the following sections describe its use and the use of a
similar  phage  to  study  the  integration  and  excision  reactions  more
deeply both in vivo and in vitro.

Some distance to either side of an integrated lambda are two sites
that  the  host  recombination  system  will  recombine  at  a  reasonable
frequency. This event excises a phage that has picked up host DNA from
both sides of the phage integration site (Fig. 18.8). Ordinarily this event
cannot be detected because the resulting DNA is too long to be packaged
in a lambda coat, but if several deletions have first been put into lambda,

this particular excision product will fit into the head, and viable phage
are formed.

The structure of the phage produced by the recombination between
two sites flanking lambda is most interesting. The phage contains two
att regions, attL and attR, and is called att2. Such an att2 phage can lose
the extra bacterial DNA by a reaction analogous to normal excision: 

BOP'   +    POB'

POP'   +    BOB'

This process requires the Int and Xis proteins and produces a viable
lambda phage genome and a minicircle (Fig. 18.9).

Study of the excision reaction requires quantitating the input phage
λatt2 as well as the product phage. Fortunately, the two may be readily
distinguished.  The  concentrations  of  λatt2  and  the  λ  generated  by
excision can be assayed in a mixture of the two by first separating the
phage on the basis of density in equilibrium centrifugation. The λatt2
phage is more dense than lambda as a result of its additional DNA.

A simpler assay of the two types of phage makes use of the sensitivity
of lambda to heat and chelators of Mg++. Removal of Mg++ ion from the
phage  reduces  the  charge  neutralization  between  phosphates  of  the

DNA  backbone,  and as a  result,  the  DNA expands and  can burst  the
phage coat. Phage particles possessing less than the usual amount of
DNA are more resistant to heating and removal of Mg++. Combinations
of  Mg++  chelators  and  elevated  temperatures  can  be  found  in  which
wild-type lambda is killed by factors of 103 to 104, but the λb2 deletion
mutant is unharmed (Fig. 18.10). The same principle can be used to titer
λ in the presence of λatt2. If the mixture is titered on plates containing
pyrophosphate,  which  chelates  magnesium,  only  the  λ  can  proceed
through multiple infective cycles and generate plaques. By titering also
on normal plates, the total number of both phage types present can be
determined since both form plaques.

Demonstrating Xis is Unstable

When lambda infects a cell and proceeds down the lysogenic pathway,
ultimately it must integrate stably into the chromosome. If both Int and
Xis proteins are synthesized, the phage DNA would repeatedly integrate
and then excise from the chromosome until these proteins have been
diluted away by growth or have become inactive. What ensures that the
last event is integration rather than excision? The phage utilizes two
mechanisms to maximize the probability that integration activity pre-
dominates under these conditions. One is the preferential synthesis of
Int protein via the pI promoter which is activated by CII protein. The
second  is  for  Xis  protein  to  be  less  stable  than  Int.  Weisberg  and
Gottesman used the att2 phage to simplify testing this hypothesis with
an in vivo assay of the stability of Int and Xis proteins.

The test used a lysogen of λCI857 briefly heat-pulsed to denature the
thermolabile repressor and induce a burst of Int and Xis protein syn-
thesis. The repressor then renatured, and  the phage-encoded  protein
synthesis  stopped.  At  times  thereafter,  portions  of  the  culture  were

additionally infected with λimm21att2xis- or λimm21att2int-. Recall that
an excision-type of reaction on λatt2 removes the extra bacterial DNA
from the phage. At early times after the heat pulsing, the Int and Xis
protein already present from the first phage complemented the int or
xis defect of the att2 and catalyzed the excision reaction to produce the
smaller single att λimm21 from the λimm21att2. At later times, however,
the Int or Xis synthesized by the first phage had decayed, and therefore
fewer wild-type λimm21 were produced (Fig. 18.11). Simply infecting at
various  times  after  the  heat  pulse  and  assaying  for  the  number  of
non-att2  lambda  that  were  produced  in  the  resulting  phage  burst  al-
lowed the kinetics of decay of the Int and Xis protein to be measured.
The half-life of Int was greater than an hour, whereas the half-life of Xis
was less than half an hour.

Inhibition By a Downstream Element

A lambda phage not integrated into the host chromosome and proceed-
ing down the lytic pathway would do well to minimize its synthesis of
Int  protein.  On  the  other  hand,  an  induced  lambda  located  in  the
chromosome has great need for Int protein to assist in excision. How
could the phage know whether or not it is integrated into the chromo-
some and how could it therefore adjust Int protein synthesis? In both
situations,  the  int-specific  promoter  pI  is  off  and  the  synthesis  and
regulation of Int and Xis proteins derives from the pL promoter.

The  location  of  the  b2  region  of  the  phage  signals  whether  it  is
integrated in  the  chromosome or is free in the  cytoplasm.  When  the
phage has excised it is circular, and the b2 region is adjacent to the int
gene (Fig. 18.12). On the other hand, when the phage is integrated, host
DNA  is  adjacent  to  the  int  gene.  These  two  situations  have  different

effects on the translation efficiency of int messenger deriving from the
pL promoter. A sequence called sib lying in the b2 region is transcribed
and  becomes  part  of  the  int  messenger  only  when  the  phage  is  not
integrated. This sequence inhibits translation of the int message.

The synthesis of Int and Xis proteins was characterized in cells that
had been exposed with a low dose of UV light to block host-encoded
protein synthesis. These cells were then infected with phage, and radio-
active amino acids were added. At various times, samples were taken
and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Int and
Xis proteins were easily detected and quantitated by autoradiography.
Alternatively, no UV light was used, and instead the Int or Xis proteins
were  precipitated  with  antibody,  further  separated  from  the  other
proteins  by  the  electrophoresis,  and  finally  quantitated  from  autora-
diographs.

Infection  by  wild-type  lambda  yields  only  a  low  synthesis  of  Int
protein, but infection by λb2 yields high synthesis of Int protein. Point
mutations and deletions have been isolated that yield high levels of Int
protein following infection. These narrowly define a region in the b2
region called sib which is responsible for the altered synthesis rate of
Int. The deletions and point mutations have a strictly cis effect on Int
protein synthesis. Therefore the effect is called downstream or retro-in-
hibition because it acts backward on expression of the preceding gene.
The sib region contains a typical transcription termination sequence,
and  the  sib  mutations  alter  the  structure  of  the  RNAse  III-sensitive
structure that can be formed in messenger that initiates from pL (Fig.
18.13). Transcripts initiated at pI normally terminate near the end of
this region, but the transcripts initiated at pL ignore termination signals
because  of  the  phage  N  protein  bound  to  RNA  polymerase,  and  the

transcription continues past this region. The pL-initiated transcripts are
capable of forming an additional base-paired region that is sensitive to
RNAse  III.  This  enzyme  that  cleaves  special  double-stranded  RNA
structures. The transcripts initiated at pI do not form the RNAse III-sen-
sitive structure. Most likely, then, cleavage by RNAse III leads to degra-
dation of the adjacent int gene messenger. As expected, the sib effect is
absent in RNAse III-defective mutants.

In vitro Assay of Integration and Excision

Although ingenious genetic experiments can reveal much about biologi-
cal systems, ultimately the details must be studied biochemically. There-
fore it was of great interest to isolate the Int and Xis proteins. Such an
isolation requires an assay for the proteins. The most reliable assay for
Int  protein  activity  is  to  seek  a  protein  that  carries  out  the  entire
integration reaction in vitro. As mentioned above, one likely require-
ment for such a reaction to proceed in vitro is a high concentration of
attB and attP regions. The easiest way to obtain these is to place both
on the same DNA molecule.

Can attB and attP be put on the same molecule, just as attL and attR
could be put on λatt2? Nash constructed such phage by selecting the
product  of  a  rare  recombination  event  in  a  region  of  nonhomology
between a λdgal-bio containing attB and a λ (Fig. 18.14). Similar to the
excision-type of reaction that occurs on λatt2, on λattB-attP an integra-
tion-type of reaction can occur. This removes the bio region and leaves
the phage considerably more resistant to Mg++ chelation or heat. Hence,
the parental phage and derivatives that have undergone an integration
reaction and have become smaller can easily be distinguished.

Initial tests with the λattB-attP phage showed that an in vitro integra-
tion  reaction  catalyzed  by  an  extract  from  cells  would  work.  The

experiment was performed by incubating the λattB-attP DNA with a cell
extract prepared from heat-pulsed lambda lysogens. Then the DNA was
extracted from the mix and used to transfect cells that had been made
capable  of taking  up  naked  lambda DNA. The phage from the trans-
fected spheroplasts were spread on a lawn of sensitive cells on a plate
containing pyrophosphate. Under these conditions, only products from
the integrative reaction would produce plaques. This provided an ex-
tremely sensitive assay for the integration reaction. Later, as the assay
conditions  were improved,  the  integration  reaction could be assayed
merely by physical quantitation of the DNA products. The locations of
restriction  enzyme  cleavage  sites  in  the  DNA  are  rearranged  by  the
integration reaction. This creates new sizes of restriction fragments that
can be detected by separating the resulting fragments by electrophoresis
(Fig. 18.15).

The in vitro integration reaction required Mg++, ATP, and spermidine.
More  careful  examination  showed  that  the  use  of  supercoiled  DNA
eliminated the requirement for ATP and Mg++. The assays permitted the
purification and characterization of biologically active Int protein, and
analogous experiments have been done with the λatt2 for the purifica-
tion of Xis protein.

Host Proteins Involved in Integration and Excision  517

Host Proteins Involved in Integration and Excision

As mentioned above, the integration reaction requires supercoiled DNA
or relaxed circular DNA plus ATP and Mg++. This suggests that the cell
extracts  contain a  protein  that  can supercoil  DNA using ATP for  the
required energy. Indeed, this proved to be so. By following the ability
of  an  extract either  to promote the  integration reaction with relaxed
circular substrates, or more simply, to produce supercoiled DNA from
relaxed  circular  DNA,  Gellert  and  coworkers  identified  and  purified
DNA gyrase. As explained in Chapter 2, this enzyme introduces negative
superhelical twists in covalently closed DNA circles.

Further study of the in vitro integration reaction revealed the require-
ment for yet another host protein. This protein is directly involved in
the integration and excision reactions. Extensive purification and char-
acterization of this  protein, which is called IHF,  for integration host
factor, showed it to be a dimer of rather small subunits, 11,000 and 9,500
molecular weight. The genes coding for these peptides, himA and himD,
had been identified genetically from host mutations that block phage
integration.  It  is  surprising  that  cells  should  possess  a  nonessential
protein  that  is  required  for  integration  of  lambda.  The  IHF  protein
assists lambda phage integration and excision by helping the DNA bend
into the complicated intasome structure that will be discussed below.
This protein plays a similar role in other systems in which DNA bending
is required.

Another  host  protein,  called  FIS,  is  also  involved  in  the  excision
process. As the intracellular levels of this protein vary with the growth
condition of the cells, it likely plays an important role in directing the
phage  into  either  the  lytic  or  the lysogenic  mode  of  existence,  but  it
regulates only when Xis is present in limited amounts.

Structure of the att Regions

Historically  the  ability  to  sequence  DNA  came  after  geneticists  had
isolated the att mutants and had determined much about the integration

and excision reactions. Therefore, obtaining the sequence of att would
permit checking the genetic inferences. Sequencing the att region was
straightforward because phage carrying the four possible att regions—
POP’, BOB’, BOP’, and POB’—were available. Landy identified the ap-
propriate  restriction  fragments  from  these  phage,  isolated  and
sequenced  them.  As  expected  from  the  genetic  experiments,  all  four
contained an identical central or core sequence corresponding to the O
part of the att region. The size of the core could not have been deter-
mined from the genetic experiments, but it turned out to be 15 base
pairs long (Fig. 18.16).

The recognition regions flanking the cores are of different lengths.
By deletion analysis, the sequences on either side of O at the bacterial
att region that are necessary for integration have been shown to be just
large enough to specify an Int protein binding site. By contrast,  attP is
about 250 base pairs long.

The sites of  Int-promoted  cleavage of the O sites have been deter-
mined exactly using radioactive phosphate both as a label and as an
agent to cleave the DNA. An in vitro integration reaction was performed
between an attP and a short DNA fragment containing attB that had

been extensively labeled with radioactive phosphate on one and then
the other strand. This generated attL and attR sites. In the attR site, all
phosphates that lie to the right of the crossover point derive from attB
and  are  therefore  both  radioactive  and  subject  to  strand  scission  by
radioactive decay. The positions of these radioactive phosphates were
then determined by permitting some to decay. The decay event cleaves
the phosphate backbones; subsequent electrophoresis of the denatured
fragments  on  a  sequencing  gel  yields  bands  corresponding  to  each
position that had a radioactive phosphate and no bands of other sizes
(Fig. 18.17). The exchange points are deduced to be at fixed positions
on the top and bottom strands, but separated by seven base pairs.

Structure of the Intasome

One approach to the study of the integration and excision reactions is
to determine where purified Int, Xis, FIS, and IHF proteins bind in the
att regions. The proteins have a complex binding pattern in attP (Fig.
18.18). Int protein binds to seven sites in attP: two in the common core,
two  on  the  P  arm,  and  three  on  the  P’  arm.  Interestingly,  the  core
sequences for Int protein binding are different from the arm sequences.
Not surprisingly then, Int protein possesses two domains, an N-terminal
domain  which  binds the  arm  sequences and  the C-terminal domain,
which binds the core sequence at the crossover point. IHF binds to three
sites, Xis protein binds to two sites, and FIS binds to one site partially
overlapping an Xis site. Together these binding sites cover the entire
region from -150 to +100 with respect to the center of the common core.
Several facts suggest that the protein-attP complex is folded rather
than  being  extended  in  a  line.  When  the  complex  of  the  various  att
regions  and  the  Int,  Xis,  FIS,  and  IHF  proteins  is  examined  in  the
electron microscope, a compact and topologically complicated struc-
ture is seen. This would make us fear that it could be an artifact except
that a complex of Int plus Xis proteins bound at attR appears to pair
specifically with a similar complex formed at attL on a different DNA
molecule. Since the bacteria and phage att regions possess no sequence
homology  except  for  their  common  core  sequences,  either  it  is  the
bound  proteins  or  it  is  recombined  DNA  that  holds the pair of  DNA

molecules together. The attB site with which attP interacts is much more
compact, possessing only the two core binding sites of Int protein. The
attB  site  probably  does  not  bind  Int  protein  by  itself  under  normal
physiological  conditions,  but  the  bare  DNA  merely  collides  with  the
intasome complex at attP and the strand exchange process then begins.
One  way  to  estimate  the  shape  of  attP  might  be  to  consider  the
bending in the DNA that is generated by each of the proteins which bind
in the region. Another approach for learning about the structure of the
intasome is to examine the topology of the DNA that engages in recom-
bination. Consider the crossover reaction when performed on a small
circular plasmid lacking supercoiled turns. When the att sites are in one
orientation, the crossover reaction generates two smaller circles from
the original, but when one of the att sites is reversed, the product of a
crossover reaction does not generate two circles (Fig. 18.19). Instead,
the segment of DNA between the sites is reversed in orientation. Further,
depending on the topology of the DNA at the time of the crossover, either
a simple circle or a knotted product called a trefoil is generated (Fig.
18.20). When one of the att sites participating in the crossover reaction
is wrapped around a core of proteins as indicated, a superhelical turn
is generated. This can be trapped in the reaction so that the product is
a trefoil rather than a simple circle. 

Nash and colleagues found two important results when examining
the products of Int protein-catalyzed segment reversal. First, that half
the products were trefoils, and second, that all the trefoils were topologi-
cally identical, that is, they possessed crossover points of the same sense.
The presence of only one kind of crossover points or nodes in the trefoils
means that the polarities of the wrapping in all the original PP’ sites

trefoils would have possessed nodes of the opposite topological sign and
would be the mirror image of the one shown. Second, the fact that the
fraction of trefoils was as large as one half means that almost all of the
attP substrate was wrapped around protein at the time of recombina-
tion.

Holliday Structures and Branch Migration in Integration

The  integration-excision  reaction  of  phage  lambda could  proceed  by
concerted double-stranded cleavages of both of the parental molecules.
Alternatively, one strand from each parental molecule could be cut and
exchanged, then the strand exchange point could be shifted by seven
base pairs to the location of the exchange for the other DNA strand. This
type of shifting is called branch migration, and normally it costs little
or no energy since for each base pair whose hydrogen bonds are broken,
a new hydrogen bonded base pair is formed (Fig. 18.21). The second
alternative  is  similar  to  the  pathway  for  general  recombination  that
utilizes a Holliday structure and was discussed earlier. Several lines of
evidence lead to the conclusion  that  it  is  the  second pathway that is
followed.

The first evidence favoring utilization of a Holliday structure is the
experimental finding that Int protein will catalyze the conversion of an
artificially  constructed  att  site  Holliday structure  to the products ex-
pected from a complete integration reaction. Part of the interest in this
important result is the trick used to generate the substrate DNA. Restric-
tion  enzyme  fragments  containing  the  four  types  of  att  sites  were
denatured  and  reannealed.  In  addition  to  regenerating  the  original
duplexes,  cross  hybridization  creates  a  Holliday-type  “chi”  structure

(Fig. 18.22). Int protein can cleave this to generate the expected prod-
ucts.

A second  line of experiments also leads to the conclusion that the
integration reaction proceeds in discrete cutting steps. In this experi-
ment an attP site on a supercoiled circle is reacted with a linear attB site.
If the integration reaction is permitted to proceed to completion, a long
linear product results. If, however, the reaction is stopped early, then
the “alpha” structures sketched in Fig. 18.23 are formed. These could
form only if a single strand is cut and exchanged. By these means one
has an assay for completion of only the first strand exchange, or both
strand exchanges.

The first cut occurs in the upper strand at the left end of the seven
base cohesive region. Placing a nick at this site in the DNA substrate
could deprive Int of the energy from the phosphodiester bond. Indeed,
such a nick blocks initiation of the integration reaction. The next step
in  the reaction  is  the branch  migration  or  branch  displacement  that
shifts the strand crossover point seven base pairs to the right. Genetic

18.11. Consider excision from a lambda lysogen with one copy of the
phage in the chromosome and one copy in an episome. What would be
the consequences of a reaction between attL on the chromosome and
attR on the phage? What might prevent this reaction if it is deleterious?
18.12. Lambda’s requirement of supercoiled DNA for integration may
merely  be  a  way  to  detect  whether  its  DNA  is  circular.  Why  would
integration  of  linear  lambda  DNA  into  the  chromosome  be  lethal?
Which  substrate  would  be  more  likely  to  possess  a  requirement  for
supercoiling, the bacterial or the phage DNA?

18.13. The superhelical twists required for the lambda excision reac-
tion  could  be  required  to  place  the  DNA  in  a  conformation  that  is
recognized by the Int and Xis proteins, or the strain put into the DNA
could assist part of the biochemistry, for example, by melting out the
crossover region. What experiments could you devise that could distin-
guish between these two possibilities?

18.14. How does the ability to cross att mutations from the phage
onto the chromosome suggest that lambda makes staggered cuts at O
when it integrates and excises?

18.15. Why would λimm434 but not λimm21 be expected to heteroim-

mune-cure a wild-type lambda lysogen?

18.16. A λpara phage was produced by insertion of lambda into the
araB gene followed by excision to produce a phage carrying the araC
gene and part of the araB gene. What would be the interpretation of the
fact that induction of a single lysogen of this phage yielded only a few
phage per cell unless arabinose was also present in the medium? Then
it would produce normal quantities of phage.

18.17. How could you make a lambda lysogen of a Gal- strain that is
also deleted of the maltose gene activator so that it is λr? You might try
infecting with lambda phage containing φ80 tail fibers, but the cells are
φ80r  as well as resistant to all other lambdoid phage and their host range
mutants. The conditions of the problem are to make the lysogen in one
step. Transducing the cells to make them Mal+ and then lysogenizing
them is forbidden.

18.18. When lambda is forced to integrate into the chromosome at
sites other than the normal lambda attachment site, it does so at low
frequencies that vary widely from site to site. What correlation would
you expect between integration frequency at a site and the fraction of
excised phage from sites that transduce adjacent bacterial genes?

18.19. In studying integration or excision events from att2 types of
substrates, the two att regions can be in parallel or opposite orientations
on the DNA molecule. How do the products of the reaction differ in these
two cases? What use might be made of either of these?

18.20. Look up and describe the basis of the genetic selection Nash

used in the construction of the λattB-attP.

18.21. Predict the consequences of introducing a gap of one base in
the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA in the middle of the seven base
region  between  the  two  sites  at  which  single-strand  cuts  are  made
during the integration or excision reactions.

Transposable Genetic
Elements

19

Transposable elements are special DNA sequences ranging upwards in
length  from several hundred base pairs. These sequences can spread
within a cell by being copied into new DNA locations as well as within
a population through infection, transformation, transduction, or conju-
gation.

The  phenomenon  of  transposing  elements  was  first  described  in
maize in the elegant genetic studies of McClintock. General interest in
the subject was then stimulated by genetic and physical studies with
MIEscherichia coli. The development of genetic engineering made the
detection,  characterization,  and study  of transposing  elements much
easier than before. Such elements have now been found in all organisms
that have been carefully examined. This chapter considers the discovery,
structure, properties, and use of transposable elements that are found
in the bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the yeast
Saccharomyces, the fruit fly Drosophila, and humans.

The  cell  is  an  ideal  home  for  a  parasitic  sequence  of  nucleotides.
There  it  should  enjoy  almost  the  same  treatment  as  an  integrated
lambda phage genome. Furthermore, the copying of such a sequence
into a new chromosomal location likely requires biochemical activities
already  present  or  easily  synthesized  in  the  host  cell.  Given  such  an
environment, it is not surprising that parasitic sequences have evolved
and now exist. A deeper question is why such sequences do not consti-
tute most of the cell’s DNA. Most likely, the tendency of such sequences
to proliferate is countermanded by evolution on a grander scale. A cell
line  or  organism  that  is  weighted  down  by  an  excessive  number  of
unused DNA sequences would be at a survival disadvantage compared
to others containing fewer such sequences. Consequently, evolution will

531

532  Transposable Genetic Elements

constantly  select  for  cells  without  too  many  transposable  sequences,
and, overall, an unhappy balance will exist between the sequence and
the  host  cell  line.  This  is  not  to  say  that  transposable  elements  are
without value to their hosts. As we will see, the presence of repeated
DNA  sequences  can  facilitate  chromosome  rearrangements.  This
reshuffling of genetic material may greatly speed evolution and aid cells
that contain at least a few repeated sequences.

In addition to being a burden upon DNA replication, the insertion of
parasitic DNA sequences into the genome will inevitably damage crucial
genes. We might therefore expect sophisticated parasitic sequences to
devise ways to avoid killing genes or proteins by their insertion. Two
methods could be used. A sequence might arrange to splice itself out of
RNA when the region has been transcribed, or the sequence might code
for a protein that splices itself out of translated protein. If the host RNA
or  protein  product  is  rejoined,  effects  upon  the  host  of  the  parasitic
sequence will be minimal. Transposable sequences have been identified
that perform either of these functions.

IS Elements in Bacteria

Nonsense mutations in many operons have polar effects, that is, they
reduce the expression of downstream genes. In efforts to study these
effects more carefully, in the late 1960s Malamy, Shapiro, and Starlinger
each isolated and characterized strongly polar mutations in the lac and
gal operons. In addition to the expected classes of nonsense mutations,
another type was also found. This new type was highly polar but not
suppressible  by  known  nonsense  suppressors.  Since  the  mutations
reverted, albeit at very low rates, it seemed likely that they were inser-
tions and not deletions. Therefore it became of great interest to find out
just what these mutations were. Nowadays this question would probably
be answered by cloning a portion of the DNA containing the mutation

and sequencing it to determine the exact nature of the mutation. Such
a procedure was impossible at the time and less direct experiments were
performed.

One  likely  cause  of  the  polarity  was  the  insertion  of  extraneous
nucleotides into the lac and gal genes. Fortunately, this possibility could
be tested by the techniques then available. If the insertions were larger
than a few hundred nucleotides, they could be detected directly because
they would increase the density of lac or gal transducing phage. There-
fore the mutations were crossed onto λdgal and φ80plac phage and the
densities of phage both with and without the mutations were carefully
compared by equilibrium gradient centrifugation (Fig. 19.1). The results
showed  that  transducing  phage  carrying  the  polar  mutations  were
denser  than  the  corresponding  transducing  phage  not  carrying  the
mutations.  Therefore  the  mutations  were  caused  by  the  insertion  of
DNA elements. These later came to be called IS, for insertion sequences.

534  Transposable Genetic Elements

At first, the insertions were suspected of being merely random se-
quences that somehow had been inserted into the genes being studied.
The mechanism of their generation is not so easy to imagine, however.
Point mutations, insertions and deletions of a nucleotide or two, and
sizable deletions may all be created by simple reactions likely to occur
in cells. Not so for sizable insertions.

Additional study of the IS sequences began to clarify their origin. One
particularly  valuable  technique  for  their  study  was  the  formation  of
DNA  heteroduplexes  (Fig.  19.2).  DNA  isolated  from  the  gal  and  lac
transducing phage with and without the IS sequences was used in these
experiments. When necessary, the strands of these phage could even be
separated and purified. The lengths of IS sequences fell into discrete
size classes, and any particular IS sequence was found to insert into a
gene  in  either  of  the  two  possible  orientations.  The  existence  of  the
length classes suggested that a small number of IS sequences might be
responsible for  all  the insertions. Indeed,  fewer than ten different IS
sequences have been found in Escherichia coli (Table 19.1). The demon-
stration that IS elements were specific sequences did not explain how
they were inserted into different sites in the cell’s chromosome, but by
analogy to lambda phage, the elements were expected to code for one
or more proteins involved in the process. By now the IS elements have
been obtained on phage and plasmids and they have been sequenced
and characterized using in vitro mutagenesis as described below. From
these studies a comprehensive picture of their structure and function
has emerged.

Structure and Properties of IS Elements

Most of the bacterial IS sequences contain two characteristic elements.
First, a sequence of 10 to 40 base pairs at one end is repeated or nearly
repeated in an inverse orientation at the other end. This is called IR, for
inverted repeat. Second, the IS sequences contain one or two regions
that appear to code for protein because they possess promoters, ribo-
some-binding  sequences,  ATG  (AUG)  codons,  and  sense  codons  fol-

lowed  by  peptide  chain  termination  codons.  If  proteins  were  made
under control of these sequences, they would likely be involved with the
process of copying the IS into a new position in the process of transpo-
sition.  Indeed,  one  of  the  gene  products  is  generally  called  the
transposase.  As  only  extremely  low  quantities  of  a  transposase  are
needed,  its  transcription  and translation are specially designed to be
inefficient. Additionally, some premium is placed on possessing a mini-
mum size, and genes of a transposon frequently overlap. For example,
in IS5 two oppositely oriented reading frames overlap. The shorter is
contained entirely within the longer (Fig. 19.3).

A high expression of the IS genes most likely would stimulate a high
rate of transposition into new chromosomal sites. Since IS transposition
rates appear low, something must protect IS genes from readthrough
transcription and translation if the sequence has inserted into an active
gene of the host cell. IS5 possesses six peptide chain termination codons
flanking the protein genes—one at each end of the transposon, one in
each  reading  frame.  Additionally,  the  left  end  of  the  IS5  contains  a
transcription termination sequence oriented so as to prevent transcrip-
tion from adjacent bacterial genes from entering the IS in the reading
direction of the transposase.

Not only do some IS sequences copy themselves or jump into new
DNA locations, but they also stimulate the creation of deletions located
near the IS elements. These deletions have one end precisely located at
the end of an IS element and apparently arise in abortive transposition
attempts  that  begin  with  transposase  nicking  the  DNA  at  one  of  the
boundaries  of  the  IS  element  (Fig.  19.4).  Such  a  facile  creation  of
deletions in any selected region is highly useful to geneticists, for, as we
have seen, a set of such deletions can be used for fine structure mapping.

536  Transposable Genetic Elements

Discovery of Tn Elements

While IS elements were under investigation, another category of genetic
elements was also being studied. These were plasmids that carry genes
encoding proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics. They are called
R-factors.

Not long after antibiotics began to be widely used, many bacterial
isolates from human infections were found to be resistant to one or more
of the drugs. These isolates were not resistant by virtue of a mutation
altering the cellular target of the antibiotics; instead, they synthesized
specific  proteins  or  enzymes,  which  conferred resistance  to  the  cells
either by detoxifying the antibiotics or by blocking their entry into the
cell. For example, penicillin-resistant strains were found to synthesize
a β-lactamase  that  opens the lactam ring of penicillin and renders  it
harmless to the cells (Fig. 19.5).

Although many R-factors were fertile and could transfer themselves
to  other  cells  by  conjugation,  the  speed  with  which  different  drug
resistances appeared on R-factors was astonishingly rapid. Soon after
the introduction of a new antibiotic, R-factors that carried genes con-
ferring resistance to the new antibiotic would be found in many geo-
graphic locations. Unfortunately this has created great problems in the
treatment  of  infections.  The  drug-resistance  factors  rapidly  pick  up
genes encoding resistance to the most commonly used drugs, and soon
treatment of infections becomes difficult. Now physicians use restraint
in prescribing antibiotics to slow the spread of drug-resistance genes.

The ability of drug-resistance genes to spread rapidly suggested that
they could hop from one R-factor to another or to other DNA sequences
such as phage or the bacterial chromosome. One demonstration of this
property came from an attempt to construct a lambda phage carrying
the kanamycin-resistance gene from an R-factor.

The objective of the experiment was to generate a λkan transducing
phage by forcing lambda to insert at random locations, and then excise.
A small fraction of the excised phage would have picked up the kanamy-
cin genes and be able to transduce cells to Kanr. Cells deleted of attB
and  carrying  a  kanamycin-resistance  R-factor  were  infected  with
lambda. This lambda phage was deleted of part of the b2 region so that
the DNA of the resulting kanamycin-transducing phage would not be

too large to be packaged. To permit the phage to integrate via the Int
pathway, the deletions chosen did not extend into the att region. As seen
in the previous chapter, a small fraction of the resulting lysogens should
then contain a lambda inserted into DNA adjacent to the kanamycin-re-
sistance gene(s) by virtue of integrating into sites that weakly resemble
lambda’s normal integration site (Fig. 19.6). Upon induction, a small
fraction of the phage were expected to excise incorrectly, pick up the
adjacent  kanamycin-resistance  genes,  and  be  capable  of  transducing
kanamycin resistance to other cells.

Indeed, kanamycin-transducing phage were isolated. The phage pos-
sessed  several  unexpected  properties,  however.  First,  the  additional
DNA  in  these  phage  was  not  located  immediately  adjacent  to  attP.
Second, kanamycin-resistant transformants obtained by infecting cells
with the λkan phage were lysogenic for lambda only if they contained
an attB. These properties can be understood as follows. The DNA coding
for kanamycin resistance originally hopped or was copied onto lambda
by a recombination event rather than arriving there after an improper
phage excision of the type that produces gal and bio transducing parti-
cles. Therefore the foreign DNA could be located anywhere on the phage
and need not be immediately adjacent to attP. Second, a copy of the
sequence  encoding  the  kanamycin  resistance  could  also  hop  or  be
copied from the phage onto the chromosome. 

The DNA responsible for conferring the kanamycin resistance was
examined by DNA heteroduplexes. It was found to be 5,400 base pairs

also possessed similar flanking sequences. Further study showed that
the repeated sequences flanking the drug-resistance genes were trans-
ferred when the drug-resistance gene hopped. Finally, it was found that
the repeated elements at the ends of many of the drug-resistance genes
possessed DNA sequences essentially identical to known IS elements.
Thus it appears that two IS elements can flank a gene and then facilitate
copying the composite element into other DNA locations by the same
transposition  reactions  as  are  used  by  IS  elements  themselves.  Se-
quences  with  these  general  properties  and  structure  are  called
transposons, or Tn elements (Table 19.2). The element described in this
section is called Tn5, and the IS sequences associated with it are called
IS50 so as not to be confused with IS5.

Structure and Properties of Tn Elements

Bacterial transposons can be grouped into four broad structural classes.
Members  of  the  class  containing  Tn5  and  Tn10  possess  a  pair  of  IS
elements on either side of a DNA sequence that is transposed. Although
the right- and left-hand IS elements are nearly identical, only one of the
IS elements encodes the transposase that is required for transposition.
The difference between the left element of Tn5, which is called IS50-L,
and the right element, IS50-R, is a single nucleotide change. This creates
an ochre mutation in the genes both for the transposase and for a second

Structure and Properties of Tn Elements  539

protein that is translated in the same reading frame, and at the same
time, creates a promoter pointed to the right.

Transposition  by  members  of  the  Tn5-Tn10  class  of  transposons
appears to require at least one protein encoded by the transposon and
only DNA sites located very near the ends of the element. If internal
sequences are deleted and if the necessary proteins are provided in trans,
the deleted element will transpose, although at a very low rate, for the
transposase from Tn10 is exceedingly unstable. This protein functions
far better in cis, and even has trouble translocating longer versions of
the transposon because of the distance separating its ends. Transposons
in this class cut themselves out of one location in the chromosome and
insert themselves into another. Their main problem then becomes one
of arranging that such a repositioning ultimately results in a net gain in
the number of transposon copies.

Tn3 belongs to a second class of transposons. Members of this group
do not contain flanking IS sequences and possess only short inverted
repeats at their ends. Their transposition requires two transposon-en-
coded proteins—a transposase and another protein. Moreover, transpo-
sition by these elements requires more than the two proteins and the
ends of the transposon. A DNA site in the middle of the transposon is

also  required.  Without  this  site,  the  transposon  does  not  complete
transposition events; it copies itself into new locations but connects the
old location to the new (Fig. 19.7). Consequently, a transposon lacking
the  internal  site  fuses  the  donor  and  target  DNA  replicons  when  it
attempts  transposition.  These  properties  demonstrate  that  transposi-
tion by these transposons occurs by copying rather than by excision and
reintegration.

cation of the transposition.

The third class of transposon is represented by phage Mu. Superfi-
cially this can be thought of as a transposon that happens to have picked
up a phage. Therefore it replicates not by freeing itself from the chro-
mosome but by copying itself into multiple locations. This property is
particularly useful for study of the process because instead of transpos-
ing at a frequency of perhaps 10-4 per generation like many transposons,
when induced, it transposes at a frequency of 102 per cell doubling time.
Tn7  constitutes  a  fourth  class  of  transposon.  It  transposes  into  a
unique site on the E. coli chromosome with high specificity, but if this
site is absent, the transposon integrates nearly at random throughout
the chromosome.

Inverting DNA Segments by Recombination, Flagellin Synthesis

Inversion of a stretch of DNA and excision of a stretch of DNA, which
will be discussed later, are closely related. Both involve crossover events
at the boundaries of the segment. As we saw in the previous chapter,
(Fig.  18.19),  site-specific  recombination  between  two  recognition  re-
gions on a DNA molecule can invert the intervening DNA. If one of the
recognition regions is reversed, however, the same excision reaction will
excise the DNA.

Here we will be concerned with a form of regulation that involves
inverting  a  DNA  segment.  Later,  a  full  chapter  will  be  devoted  to
chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense and move toward attractants or
away from repellents. The movement is generated by rotation of flagella.
In Salmonella two different genes encode flagellin. Depending on the

orientation of an invertible controlling DNA element, only one or the
other of the flagellin genes is expressed at one time.

In the habitat of Salmonella, the gut, considerable selective advantage
accrues  to  the  strain  that  can  express  more  than  one  flagellin  type.
Antibody secreted by patches of special cells on the walls of the intestine
can bind to a flagellum and block rotation of the flagella and therefore
stop chemotaxis. Hence, to survive and swim in the presence of antiflag-
ellin antibody, it is to a cell’s advantage to be able to synthesize a second
type of flagellin against which the host does not yet possess antibody.
In  these  circumstances,  the  simultaneous  synthesis  of  two  types  of
flagellin within a cell would be harmful. If both types of flagellin were
incorporated into flagella, then either of two types of antibody could
block  chemotaxis  rather than  just one.  Consequently, if two flagellin
genes are present, one should be completely inactive while the other is
functioning.

Figure 19.8  The structure of the DNA at the flagellin controlling sequence in

region.  The  region  also  contains  a  promoter  for  synthesis  of  H2  and  rhl
messenger when the region is in one orientation.

How can an appropriate flagellin synthesis flip-flop circuit be con-
structed using regulatory elements available to a cell? Only one of the
flagellin genes should possess any activity at one time, but reversing the
activity pattern should be readily possible. These requirements are not
easily  met  using  regulatory  elements  of  the  type  we  have  thus  far
considered. In general, the regulation systems we have considered in
previous chapters do not permit construction of simple circuits possess-
ing two states of dramatically different activities and at the same time
permit simple switching on time scales of hours between the two states.
For example, although the lambda phage early gene system possesses
the necessary selectivity in having two states, fully off and fully on, this
system is not reversible. Alternatively, genes regulated like lac, trp, and
ara  either  do  not  possess  large  differences  between  their  on  and  off
states, or they flip states on time scales short compared to a doubling
time of the cells.

An invertible controlling segment of DNA solves Salmonella’s prob-
lem. In one orientation, only one type of flagellin is synthesized, and in
the other orientation, only the other type is synthesized. The apparatus
responsible  for  flipping  the  DNA  segment  can  be  completely  inde-
pendent  of  flagellin  or  expression  of  the  flagellin  genes.  That  is,  the
protein or proteins necessary for inversion of the DNA segment can be
synthesized independently at a rate appropriate for optimum survival
of the population.

The structure of the invertible segment hin in Salmonella is similar
to IS elements and also to the portion of Mu phage called the G segment.
The hin segment is 995 base pairs long. It has inverted repeats of 14
bases  at  its  ends,  and  its  central  region  encodes  a  protein  that  is
necessary for inversion. At its right end the element contains a promoter
oriented to the right. Just to the right of the invertible segment lies one
of the flagellin genes, H2, and another gene called rhl. The Rhl protein
is a repressor of the second flagellin gene, H1, located elsewhere on the
chromosome. As a result of this structure, one orientation of the invert-
ible element provides synthesis of H2 protein and Rhl repressor. In this
state the Rhl repressor blocks synthesis of H1 flagellin (Fig. 19.8). When

542  Transposable Genetic Elements

the controlling element is in the other orientation, H2 and Rhl protein
are not synthesized because they have been separated from their pro-
moter, and therefore synthesis of H1 is not repressed.

The strategy of switching the antigenic properties of crucial surface
structures is not unique to bacteria. African trypanosomes, unicellular
flagellated cells, can evade the immune systems of vertebrates by switch-
ing their synthesis of surface proteins. These protozoa have hundreds
of  different  genes  for the  same  basic  surface protein.  The  process of
switching on the synthesis of any one of them, however, resembles more
closely the mating-type switch of yeast than the orientation switching
involved with the switching of Salmonella flagellin synthesis.

Mu Phage As a Giant Transposable Element

A transposon could carry DNA with phage-like functions rather than a
simple antibiotic resistance gene. Such a transposon would be able to
travel freely from cell to cell autonomously as a virus. Phage Mu first
drew  attention  by  its  ability  to  generate  mutations  in  infected  cell
populations.  These  mutations  were  generated  by  its  insertion  into
various bacterial genes. Careful mapping of many Mu phage insertions
into  the β-galactosidase  gene  showed  that  Mu  inserted  without  high
specificity in its target sequence. Thus, Mu behaved like a lambda phage
with little sequence specificity in its choice of the bacterial att site.

Two facts, however, indicate that Mu is more like a transposon than
like phage lambda. First, Mu duplicates five bases of chromosomal DNA
upon its insertion. Most transposons generate such duplications. These
arise as a result of staggered nicking of the target sequence followed by
insertion of the transposon and replication (Fig. 19.9). Second, Mu does
not excise from the chromosome and replicate in the cytoplasm. Even
though an induced cell may yield a hundred Mu phage upon lysis, never
during the lytic cycle are any free Mu DNA molecules observed. The Mu
DNA is replicated only by transposition. Packaging of the Mu takes place
directly on the integrated DNA. A dramatic demonstration of replication
by transposition is provided by Southern transfers of DNA taken from
a Mu lysogen before and after induction of the phage. Before induction,
only a single restriction fragment of the host DNA contains sequences

of

homologous to a restriction fragment including the end of Mu, but half
an  hour  after  induction  of  Mu  growth,  many  restriction  fragments
contain these sequences (Fig. 19.10).

Mu packages its DNA right out of the chromosomal insertions. Part
of the head structure recognizes a sequence near the left end of the DNA,
reaches out beyond the phage 50 to 150 base pairs, and begins packag-
ing.  A headfull  of  DNA  is  packaged,  and the  remaining DNA is then

cleaved and the tail is attached. Since a Mu phage headfull of DNA is
slightly larger than the genome of the phage, the packaged DNA usually
extends beyond the right end of the phage and includes about 3,000 base
pairs of bacterial DNA as well. The headfull hypothesis explains the fact

544  Transposable Genetic Elements

that a Mu phage carrying an insertion packages a smaller amount of
bacterial DNA roughly equal in amount to the size of the insertion.

The sequence heterogeneity that results from the headfull mode of
packaging  is  dramatically  displayed  when  heteroduplexes  of  phage
genomes  are  analyzed  in  the  electron  microscope.  Since  it  is  highly
unlikely that the two strands from the same phage will rehybridize upon
formation of the heteroduplex, two unrelated strands will associate. The
phage DNA portions of the strands will, of course, be complementary
and will form a duplex. The strands of bacterial DNA on the right end,
however,  are  unlikely  to  be  complementary,  and  these  will  remain
single-stranded and are observed as “split ends.” The similar split ends
from the left end are too small to be clearly observed.

An Invertible Segment of Mu Phage

The split-ended heteroduplexes described in the preceding section are
observed with DNA that is obtained from Mu-infected cells. Mu DNA
obtained instead from an induced lysogen yields heteroduplexes con-
taining not only the split end, but half of them also contain an internal
single-stranded  region  of  3,000  base  pairs  that  forms  a  bubble  (Fig.
19.11).  This bubble results from the fact that the region, called G, is
inverted in about half of the phage.

The ability of Mu to invert G can be abolished by a small deletion at
the end of G or by a point mutation in the adjacent region of the DNA
called gin. This point mutation can be complemented, thereby proving
that gin encodes a protein that participates in inversion of G. Curiously,
phage P1 also contains the same G loop, and P1 can complement Mu
gin mutants.

The G-loop segment codes for proteins that determine the host range
of Mu. Phage induced from lysogens with G in the plus orientation are
able to adsorb to Escherichia coli K-12, but not to Citrobacter freundii
or Escherichia coli C. When G is in the minus orientation, the abilities
of  the  resultant  phage  to  adsorb  to  these  strains  are  reversed.  This
phenomenon  provides  an  explanation  of  the  heteroduplexing  experi-
ments. Those Mu able to adsorb to Escherichia coli K-12 must be in the
plus orientation. Since the rate of inversion is low, the G region of most

of the phage in the resulting lysate will still be in the plus orientation,
and heteroduplexes prepared from this DNA will not contain G bubbles.
Lysogens are different. Although the phage originally entered cells with
the  G  loop  in  the  plus  orientation,  during  the  many  generations  of
growth from a single lysogen, G can invert, and eventually about half
the cells in the population will contain Mu with G in the plus orientation
and half will contain Mu with G in the minus orientation. Induction of
the phage in this cell population and preparation of DNA heteroduplexes
will yield half the molecules with G bubbles.

The mutants with G stuck in one orientation because of the deletion
at the end of G or the point mutation in gin permit a particularly simple
demonstration of the infectivity properties. Mu lysogens with G stuck
in the minus orientation yield phage particles, but these are not infective
on Escherichia coli K-12. Mu lysogens containing G stuck in the plus
orientation are fully infective when plated on Escherichia coli K-12.

Genetic analysis of the G region of the phage shows that two sets of
genes are involved: S and U, and S’ and U’. S and U are expressed when
G is in the plus orientation and S’ and U’ are expressed when G is in the
minus orientation (Fig. 19.12). The promoter for these genes and the
initial portion of the S gene is contained in the α region adjacent to G.
Thus, G contains a variable portion of S and S’ as well as the intact U
and U’ genes. This is an interesting example of a situation in which a
given DNA sequence can be used to specify different products.

In vitro Transposition, Threading or Global Topology?

Like  most  systems,  deeper  understanding  of  transposition  requires
learning the biochemical details of the transposition reactions. This, in
turn, requires assay of the reaction and the use of purified components.
One convenient assay for transposition utilizes a plasmid containing the
DNA sites involved in a transposition reaction. Rearrangement of seg-
ments of the plasmid resulting from transposition will change the sizes

of DNA fragments resulting from subsequent restriction enzyme cleav-
age.

Experiments with a plasmid containing two res sites of Tn3 showed
that resolution would proceed in vivo in the presence of a Tn3 with a
functional resolvase gene. The reaction would also take place in vitro
upon the addition of purified resolvase. This reaction occurred, how-
ever, only if the plasmid DNA was supercoiled and if the two  res sites
on  the  plasmid  were  correctly  oriented.  Reversing  one  blocked  the
reaction,  in  contrast  to  what  is  seen  with  lambda  phage  where  the
excision reaction will proceed with the att sites in either orientation with
respect to one another.

Why should an orientation requirement exist? We might expect that
the two sites encounter each other by random flailings about of the DNA,
in which case, there could be no orientation requirement. One attractive
hypothesis to explain the orientation requirement is threading. Once the
protein binds one site, it reaches the other by crawling along the DNA,
thus preserving its knowledge of the orientation of the first site. Thread-
ing  the  DNA  through  the  protein  until  the  second  site  arrives  at  the
protein accomplishes the same end.

The requirement for a specific orientation for the transposition sites
can be explained in a different way. Suppose that the sites had to interact
in a specific orientation at the time of transposition. Due to negative
supercoiling,  two sites  which  are in inverted repeat  orientation  on  a
circular DNA molecule will interact in a parallel orientation (Fig. 19.13).
Interacting in an antiparallel orientation would require massive rear-
rangement of the supercoils and would be highly unlikely to occur.

The two possible explanations for the orientation requirement of the
interacting sites of the Mu-Tn3 class of transposons can be tested by
making use of the lambda phage integration enzymes. After a plasmid
containing  Mu  sites  which are  flanked  by  lambda  phage  attachment
sites has supercoiled itself, then reaction between the lambda att sites
can be performed. Such an interaction should have little effect upon the
overall supercoiled structure of the plasmid. Yet, if the sites are in one

orientation, the reaction will invert the Mu sites, and if the lambda att
sites  are  in  the  opposite  orientation,  the  reaction  will  generate  two
separate  DNA  molecules,  each  containing  one  of  the  Mu  sites  (Fig.
19.14). Neither orientation of the lambda att sites had any effect on the
Mu transposition reaction. This result shows that tracking is not used
by the Mu enzymes to determine the transposition sites’ orientations,
but rather it is the orientation of the sites with respect to one another
in the supercoiled DNA that matters.

Hopping by Tn10

An intermediate in the transposition process of Tn3 contains both the
source and target molecules joined together in a cointegrate. Then a
recombination event in the res site resolves these structures. The exist-
ence  of  cointegrates  proves  that  Tn3  transposes  by  replication.
Transposon  Tn10  is  different.  No  cointegrate  structures  were  ever
observed.  This fact suggests that Tn10 might transpose without repli-
cation.

A conceptually simple experiment can test whether Tn10 replicates
as it transposes. Kleckner and Bender constructed a lambda phage that
could not replicate upon entering a normal host. The phage contained
Tn10 that carried both a tetracycline resistance gene and the lacZ gene.
A second phage was also made that was identical to the first except that
it contained a nonsense mutation in lacZ.

Consider the consequences of infecting a LacZ- cell with a phage that
is heteroduplex for the point mutation (Fig. 19.15). Since the phage does
not replicate, the only way for cells to become tetracycline resistant is
for  the  transposon  to enter  the cell’s chromosome. If the  transposon

replicates as it transposes, then the lacZ that is inserted into the chro-
mosome will be homozygous. It will either be wild type or mutant on
both strands. If, however, the transposon excises itself from the phage
and inserts itself into the chromosome before replicating, then the lacZ
gene will remain heterozygous. If the cells are repair deficient, only after
the first chromosome replication will each DNA molecule within the
cells become homozygous. This means, however, that the descendants
of  the original cell will be of two types, Lac+ and Lac-. Because cells
forming a colony do not mix, one half the colony will be Lac+ and one
half Lac-. On Lac indicating plates a sector comprising about half the
colony will indicate Lac+ and the other half will indicate Lac-.

A simple control experiment was possible by infecting cells lysogenic
for lambda phage. The infecting lambda phage could recombine into
the prophage in regions of homology at considerably higher frequency
that the transposon relocates on its own. Therefore, tetracycline-resis-
tant cells would have obtained a heterozygous copy of the lacZ gene, and
should  show  sectoring  on  the  indicating  plates.  They  did.  Therefore
Tn10 hops.

In order for Tn10 to survive, it must hop infrequently, and shortly
after passage of a replication fork (see problem 19.19). The infrequent
hopping results from a low synthesis rate and extreme instability of its
transposase.  The  transposase  is  so  unstable  that  the  larger  the  Tn10
element, the less frequently it transposes, and transposase barely func-
tions in trans at all. The low synthesis rate of transposase results from
two factors. One is a low activity of the promoter serving transposase,
pIN on IS10-L, and the second is antisense messenger deriving from pOUT
(Fig. 19.16). This second promoter is active, and its product hybridizes

with the beginning of transposase messenger to block translation. This
is one of several examples of antisense messenger playing an important
biological role.

A  simple  experiment  showed  that  antisense  messenger  from  pOUT
reduces translation of the pIN messenger rather than interfering with its
transcription. Two fusions of β-galactosidase to the transposase gene
were made (Fig. 19.17). One was a protein fusion in which the N-termi-
nal portion of transposase substituted for the N-terminal of β-galactosi-
dase.  In  this,  the  levels  of  transposase  messenger  as  well  as  any
regulation of translation would affect the synthesis of β-galactosidase.
In the second fusion, β-galactosidase was placed further downstream so
that only the synthesis level of transposase messenger would affect the
synthesis of β-galactosidase. A plasmid with a copy of the pOUT region
was introduced to these two cell lines. The extra copies of the pOUT RNA

decreased  β-galactosidase  synthesis  from  the  protein  fusion,  but  not
from  the  gene  fusion,  thus  showing  that  the  antisense  RNA  affects
translation of transposase messenger.

Another type of control of transposition also exists. It has been found
that damaging the host cell dam methylase system increases transposi-
tion frequency. The dam methylase is the system that methylates GATC
sequences to permit repair enzymes to identify newly replicated DNA.
There are two GATC sequences in IS10, one in the -10 region of pIN, and
the other in the binding site of transposase. Methylating both of these
sites greatly decreases the transposition frequency by reducing both the
promoter activity and the transposase activity. What about half meth-
ylated,  or hemimethylated DNA, as  is generated after replication? In
vitro experiments showed that DNA methylated on one strand is signifi-
cantly more active than  fully  methylated  DNA,  both in the promoter
activity and in the transposase activity.

The activity of hemimethylated DNA could also be examined in vivo.
Conjugating male cells transfer only one strand. The recipients synthe-
size  the  complementary  strand  as  it  enters.  Donor  Dam+  cells  were
mated with Dam- recipient cells to generate hemimethylated DNA. This
DNA was prevented from recombining into the female by the presence
of a RecA- mutation. Thus, the only way recipient cells could become
tetracycline resistant would be for the transposon to hop. The frequency
of  transposition  hopping  could  be measured  by  determining  the fre-
quency of tetracycline-resistant cells. Hemimethylated Tn10 transposed
much more frequently than fully methylated Tn10. These results mean
than Tn10 is much more likely to transpose just after the replication
fork has passed.

Retrotransposons in Higher Cells

The genomes of higher cells contain substantial numbers of repeated
sequences. For example, the Alu sequence of 300 base pairs constitutes
about 5% of the human genome. Among these repeated sequences are
two main classes of transposable elements. One is similar to Tn10 in its
DNA transposition mode. This includes the Ac element in maize, Tc1 in
nematodes, and the P element in Drosophila. Members in the other class
transpose by means of an RNA intermediate, and they include the Ty1
factor in yeast, the copia-like elements in Drosphila and the long inter-
spersed, LI elements in mammals. These elements are retrotransposons
and are closely related to retroviruses, if not identical to retroviruses in
some cases.

Hybridization and sequencing of Ty1 and the regions into which it
inserts have revealed its structure. It duplicates five bases upon insertion

δ

Retrotransposons in Higher Cells  551

and  consists  of  two  flanking  regions,  called  delta,  of  330  base  pairs
oriented as direct repeats around a 5,600-base-pair central region that
contains considerable homology to retroviruses. Not all delta elements
found in yeast are identical, nor are the central regions identical, for
some Ty elements are able to block expression of nearby yeast genes
while others stimulate expression of genes near the point of integration.
A recombination event between the two delta elements deletes the
central region and one delta element. Hence it is not surprising that the
yeast genome contains about 100 of these solo delta elements. Recom-
bination between different Ty elements can create various chromoso-
mal rearrangements. Although the consequences of recombination can
be  determined  easily  in  yeast,  similar  chromosome  rearrangements
catalyzed  by  recombination  between  repeated  sequences  must  also
occur in other organisms. Consequently transposons may be of positive
value to an organism because they may speed chromosome rearrange-
ments that may directly generate new proteins and new schemes of gene
regulation.

Retroviruses, whose study began long before their discovery as a part
of the yeast Ty1 factors, are particles that contain single-stranded RNA.
This  is  both  translated  upon  infection  as  well  as  converted  via  an
RNA-DNA hybrid to a DNA-DNA duplex that is often integrated into the
genome of the infected cell and is called a provirus. This form of the
virus and defective variants can be considered the retrotransposon. The
generation of the RNA-DNA duplex is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase.
This enzyme is packaged within the virus particle. Upon their insertion
into the chromosome, retroviruses duplicate a small number of bases
as a result of generating staggered nicks in the target sequence. At each
end of the retrovirus sequence is an inverted repeat of about 10 base
pairs that is part of a few-hundred-base-pair direct repeat. Between the
direct  repeats,  which  are  named  long  terminal  repeats  or  LTRs,  are
sequences of about 5,000 base pairs that code for viral coat protein and
other proteins. Transcription begins near the end of one LTR, proceeds

through the central region, and ends within the other LTR.

Some of the DNA that is found in repeated sequences in Drosophila
has been analyzed, and its properties suggest that it too is related to
proviruses. One such family is copia. Small virus-like particles contain-
ing RNA homologous to copia DNA sequences can even be isolated from
the nucleus of Drosophila cells. This RNA is translatable into one of the
proteins that coats the RNA.

Retroviruses have been much harder to demonstrate in humans than
in other animals. Nonetheless, they have been found. One was found to

552  Transposable Genetic Elements

have inserted a copy of itself into the gene encoding factor VIII which
is necessary for blood coagulation.

A  more  easily  observed  element  in  the  human  genome  is  the  Alu
family of sequences. Humans contain 100,000 to 500,000 copies of this
sequence. The name derives from the fact that the restriction enzyme
Alu cleaves more than once within the sequence. Consequently, diges-
tion of human DNA with Alu yields 100,000 identical fragments, which
upon electrophoresis generate a unique band in addition to the faint
smear generated by the heterogeneity of the remainder of the DNA. The
Alu sequences look like direct DNA copies of mRNA molecules because
they  contain  a  stretch  of  poly  deoxyadenosine  at  their  3’  ends.  Like
transposons,  the  Alu  sequences  also  are  flanked  by  direct  repeats  of
chromosomal sequences of 7 to 20 base pairs. It is not possible to tell
from their  structure whether  retroviruses  and Alu  sequences  evolved
from transposable elements or the reverse.

An RNA Transposition Intermediate

With the similarity of the yeast Ty1 sequence to retroviruses, it was of
considerable  interest  to  determine  whether  the  element  transposes
using an RNA intermediate or a DNA intermediate. One simple way to
test whether Ty1 proceeds through an RNA intermediate was to make
use  of  the  fact  that  in  eukaryotic  cells  intervening  sequences  are  re-
moved from mRNA. Fink and co-workers placed a strong and control-
lable promoter upstream of a Ty element (Fig. 19.18). In the middle of
the element they placed a segment of a yeast ribosomal protein gene
containing an intervening sequence. Inducing the promoter led to a high
frequency of transposition. Most importantly, the transposed elements
lacked the intervening sequence, thereby proving they had transposed

quence  in  the  ribosomal  protein  gene  is  spliced  out  and  the  resulting

via an RNA intermediate, and while in the RNA state, had been subjected
to the cellular processing that removes intervening sequences.

P Elements and Transformation

Transposons should form ideal vectors for genetic engineering. DNA to
be  transposed  into  a  chromosome  merely  has  to  be  inserted  at  a
nonessential site within a transposon active in the desired cells, and then
the  transposon  DNA  has  to  be  injected  into  the  cells.  Indeed,  such
constructs do work, and were first made with bacterial transposons Tn3,
Tn5 and Tn10. The P element from Drosophila has many characteristics
of a transposable sequence capable of regulating its transposition, and
it too can be engineered for transformation of DNA into cells.

When a male P+ line is mated with a female non-P line, a short interval
of intense transposition in the developing embryo follows, and many
genes  are inactivated by  the insertion of  P elements. Afterwards,  the
transposition activity ceases, and the resultant strains are genetically
stable.  The  reverse–mating  a  P+  female  with  a  non-P  male–does  not
stimulate transposition. By analogy to the bacterial transposons or to
phage lambda, the P elements behave as though they encode a repressor
and enzymes necessary for transposition. Upon entry of a P element into
a  new  cytoplasm,  the  temporary  absence  of  repressor  permits  the
transposition enzymes to be synthesized, and transposition likely oc-
curs. Additionally, the Drosophila P elements appear to be stimulated
to excise from their former locations as well as to copy themselves into
new locations because many of the mutations generated by insertions
of P elements can be induced to revert by the same mating process that
stimulates P element mutations.

A  P  element  would  form  a  useful  vector  for  inserting  DNA  into  a
chromosome of a fruit fly. By analogy with the bacterial transposons,
nearly any sequence of foreign DNA could be inserted into the middle

of  the  P  element.  If  this  P  element  plus  a  P  element  providing
transposase  were  introduced  into  a  non-P  egg  cell,  transposition  en-
zymes should be synthesized and move or copy the altered P element
into the cellular DNA (Fig. 19.19).

Spradling and Rubin found that all these expectations were correct
and that P elements do provide a basis for efficient transformation of
DNA into Drosophila. They inserted the rosy gene into the middle of an
internally  deleted  P  element.  Then  they  injected  both  plasmid  DNA
containing the P element with inserted DNA and plasmid DNA contain-
ing an intact P into developing rosy negative Drosophila embryos. The
injection was into a portion of the embryo in which the germ line cells
develop. It was done while the embryo was multinucleate but before cell
walls had developed. Many of the injected embryos survived and yielded
mosaic  adults  whose  progeny  would  then  be  homogeneous.  Some
possessed a functional rosy gene in all the fly’s tissues (Fig. 19.20). These
flies were easily detected because their eye color was different from that
of the untransformed rosy negative mutants.

The sequence of events in transformation is as follows. The injected
P element DNA is transcribed in the nucleus, and the resulting RNA is
transported to the cytoplasm where it is translated into transposition
enzymes that return to the nucleus. There they catalyze the transposi-
tion of the P element containing the rosy gene into a Drosophila chro-
mosome. In the meantime, cell walls form, and the embryo develops to
a larva and finally to an adult. Some of the cells of its germ line contain
the functional rosy gene carried in the P element. When this fly matures
and mates with a mutant rosy strain, those progeny that receive egg or
sperm  containing  the  rosy  gene  on  the  P  element  will  then  express
functional xanthine dehydrogenase that is encoded by the rosy gene.

P Element Hopping by Chromosome Rescue  555

P element transformation is a valuable technique for the introduction
of  DNA  into  Drosophila.  It  is  used  routinely  in  the  study  of  gene
regulation and development. P element transformation possesses sev-
eral drawbacks, however. First, the size of DNA that can be inserted into
the chromosome is limited to what can be placed within a P element
and handled on a plasmid carrying a P element. Some interesting genes
are much  larger than  this size. A second problem is that  P elements
insert randomly. Because  the expression level of a gene in Drosophila
depends upon the position into which it has been placed, comparisons
of  gene  activity  in  a  collection  of  transformants  cannot  be  closely
compared.

P Element Hopping by Chromosome Rescue

The above-mentioned difficulties with P element transformation can be
overcome by utilizing a property of the cells. Not surprisingly, parasites
have  capitalized  on  the  cell’s  need  for  mechanisms  to  preserve  frag-
ments  of  broken  chromosomes.  The  P  elements  appear  to  use  this
machinery by leaving a gap behind when they excise themselves from
one chromosomal location and insert themselves into another. The cell’s
gap  repair  or  chromosome  rescue  enzymes  then  replace  the  DNA
missing from the gap by making use of a copy of the chromosome that
still contains a P element.

Ordinarily,  the  ends  of  chromosomes  are  not  recognized  by  this
repair pathway due to the presence of the telomere structures. The gaps
left by P element excision, however, lack telomeres and are acted upon
by the rescue enzymes. 

In the rescue process a small amount of DNA is digested from the
ends by an exonuclease. Then, at each end, one of the two DNA strands
can be further digested so as to leave single-stranded tails. As a result of
RecA-like  activity,  these  single-stranded  tails  can  invade  double-
stranded DNA possessing complementary sequences. Subsequent elon-
gation by DNA polymerase and recombination completes the process
that removes the gap. If the P element excision and repair process occurs
shortly  after  chromosome replication, then the sister chromatids are
adjacent to one another and the centromere has not yet divided. Hence,
the most probable template for repair of a P element excision event is
simply the sister chromatid (Fig. 19.21). Thus, the gap is repaired with
another copy of the P element. In toto, a P element has been released
with  no  net  change  to  the  chromosome.  Sometimes,  however,  a  P
element can excise from the chromosome before chromosome replica-
tion. In this case the template for repair of the gap can be the homolo -
gous chromosome. This other chromosome need not carry a P element
in this position, and therefore the healed chromosome may not contain
a P element.

Consider a P element near or in a region we wish to modify. If it can
be induced to excise, then the repair mechanisms in the cell can use
either the sister chromatid, or the homologous chromosome, or even
just a homologous sequence located on a different chromosome. There-

fore, we can modify the sequence as we desire, and insert it without a
means of expression into the cells. Then we can induce excision of the
P element inactivating our gene. Repair of the resulting gap can use the
specially doctored DNA, and a fraction of the surviving cells will have
replaced a portion of their original gene with our modified sequence.
Hence, a directed mutagenesis step has been performed. This replace-
ment  does  not  require  that  the  P  element  have  carried  the  entire
modified gene, and further, the DNA sequence we have introduced by
this method goes exactly to the desired chromosome site.

In summary, P elements are useful in genetic engineering in three
basic types of experiments. First, they can be used as mutagens. They
can transpose into genes and inactivate them. Because it is straightfor-
ward to clone the DNA flanking such an insertion event, it is possible to
search  for  P  element  transformation  events  that  have  inactivated  a
desired gene, and then to clone the inactivated gene. A second use of the
P elements is to carry DNA into Drosophila. Either intact genes can be
carried into whatever location a P element hops into, or fragments of
genes can be engineered to replace exactly a region of DNA already in
the  chromosome.  The  third  use  of  P  elements  is  the  enhancer  trap
experiments that were described in Chapter 17. In those experiments, a

19.11.  What  problem,  unaddressed  in  the  text,  is  raised  by  the
following fact? Density labeling Mu phage and infecting show that the
same DNA molecule that was packaged in the phage coat, not a copy of
this  DNA  molecule,  is  integrated  into  the  chromosome  of  a  newly
formed Mu lysogen.

19.12. Consider a transposon in the Tn5-Tn10 class that is flanked by
inverted IS sequences. During transposition, the outside ends of the IS

be used.

Generating Genetic
Diversity: Antibodies

20

The restriction-modification systems discussed in earlier chapters pro-
vide  bacteria  with  the  ability  to  identify  and  destroy  foreign  DNA.
Multicellular  organisms  also  must  be  able  to  identify  and  destroy
foreign invaders. Such invaders include not only viruses but also bacte-
ria  and  yeasts  as  well  as  multicelled  parasites.  Additionally,  higher
organisms  must  protect  themselves  against  their  own  uncontrolled
growth. From time to time, a few of their cells lose proper regulation
and begin uncontrolled growth. Often these runaway cells are stopped
by the immune system, but when they are not, the result is cancer.

Similar to a bacterium’s “immunity” to infection by phage lambda,
an  organism  can  be  resistant  to  infection  by  a  parasite  through  the
action of a specific protein-mediated interaction. The specific portion
of the immune response of vertebrates can be considered to consist of
two  steps:  first,  recognizing  a  macromolecule  that  is  foreign  to  the
organism;  and  second,  doing  something  with  the  recognized  macro-
molecule. Because of the complexity of the immune system, this chapter
will be concerned primarily with only a portion of the first part of the
system,  that  involving  adaptive  and  specific  recognition  of  foreign
molecules. The core of this response is a set of rearrangements of DNA
segments and alterations in DNA sequences that generate a multitude
of genes, each slightly different from the others. These code for the many
different proteins that recognize the foreign molecules.

The Basic Adaptive Immune Response 

Vertebrates  can  detect and  dispose  of  most foreign macromolecules.
Foreign  macromolecules  that  can  stimulate  the  immune  system  to

563

564  Generating Genetic Diversity: Antibodies

produce  a  response  are  called  antigens.  These  can  include  protein,
nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids that originate in a vertebrate
from bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, from injections of foreign
materials, or from the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell.
The transformed cells usually possess altered cell surfaces that often are
recognized by the immune system.

Evolution has chosen a compromise between the ability of an animal
to respond immediately to any one of millions of foreign antigens and
the  enormous  burden  that  would  result  from  being  able  to  respond
quickly. Young vertebrates possess the ability to recognize and respond
to most foreign invaders, but this ability begins at a very low level for
most antigens. Only some time after exposure to an antigen does the
animal’s  ability  to  respond  to  that  antigen  begin  to  be  significant.
Thereafter, the animal can respond more quickly and more vigorously
to the reappearance of a particular antigen. As a result of such exposure
animals acquire immunity.

In most cases, the immune system can mobilize to deal with a new
antigen before the presence of its source can harm the animal. Speeding
and amplifying the immune response is the objective of medical immu-
nization.  In  such  immunizations,  antigens  are  injected  to  prime  the
immune system. To avoid transmitting the disease associated with the
antigen, antigenic material extracted from the organism is injected, or
the organism is killed before injection, or a relatively harmless variant
is injected. Therefore the animal generates an immune response without
suffering  the  actual  dangerous  infection.  Often,  a  second  or  third
injection is made after several weeks to boost the animal’s response.

Two responses begin to be apparent within a week of the introduction
of a new antigen into an animal. New proteins called antibodies appear
in the serum. They are able to bind specifically to the antigen and not
to  other  molecules.  Also,  a  subpopulation  of  the  cell  type  called  T
lymphocytes appears. T lymphocytes, which ordinarily are found in the
blood, spleen, and lymph nodes, have the ability to bind parts of the
antigen to their surface.

In some cases, the mere binding of antibodies or T cells to an antigen
is enough to protect the animal from the source of the antigen. As an
example, the binding of antibody to the flagella of Salmonella, discussed
in  the  previous  chapter,  may  sufficiently  immobilize  the  cell  that  it
cannot  survive  in  the  intestinal  tract.  Usually,  however,  an  animal’s
immune response includes more than just antibody molecules or T cells
binding to the antigen. Additional proteins and cell types may partici-
pate in elimination of antigens. These recognize complexes of antibody
bound to antigen and act to kill, digest, or eliminate the foreign material
as well as to modulate the additional synthesis of antibodies and specific
T cells. One such array of proteins is called the complement system.

In addition to the T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes also play an impor-
tant  role  in  the  immune  response.  They  are  found  in  bone  marrow,
blood,  spleen,  and  lymph  nodes  where  they  synthesize  and  secrete
antibody molecules. All the antibody molecules synthesized by a par-
ticular  B  cell  are  of  a  single  type.  These  bind  to  best  to  antigens

Telling the Difference Between Foreign and Self   565

possessing the same shape which elicited their synthesis and less well
to molecules possessing similar shapes. Analogously, each T cell has a
single binding specificity. One of the problems of immunology is under-
standing how the different B or T cells acquire the ability to synthesize
proteins  with  recognition  specificities.  As  we  will  see  in  more  detail
later, different immature lymphocytes possess the ability to recognize
different antigens. The presence of one of these antigens can trigger one
of the pre-B cell lymphocytes to begin growth and division. This growth
requires  both  the  antigen  binding  to  the  surface  of  the  B  cell  and
stimulation from a class of T cells that is defined by a surface antigen
of  its  own  called  CD4.  After  about  twelve  divisions  of  B  cells,  this
expanded clone of identical cells can synthesize and secrete appreciable
quantities of antibody. This chapter will concern itself primarily with B
cells. The same gene structures and gene rearrangements found in B
cells also exist in T cells, and will not be discussed in detail here.

Telling the Difference Between Foreign and Self 

What keeps a vertebrate from synthesizing antibodies against its own
macromolecules? In principle, one solution to this problem would be to
have the entire repertoire of an animal’s antibody specificities explicitly
encoded in the genome and expressed during development. Then the
problem of preventing synthesis of antibodies against itself would be
simple.  None  would  be  coded  in  the  collection  of  specificities.  This
would be inefficient for at least two reasons. First, as we will see in the
next  section,  the  very  large  number  of  specificities  needed  by  the
immune system would use an inordinate amount of the coding potential
of  the  genome.  Second,  such  an  inflexible  system  would  be  highly
dangerous, for the moment an invader mutated and developed surface
molecules not neutralized by the host cells’ immune system, the invader
could freely grow in the host animal, and the entire population of host
animals could be killed. It would be as though the animals didn’t possess
any immune system at all, for the mutated invader would encounter no
opposition.

For these reasons we expect considerable randomness, even in ge-
netically identical animals, in the generation of antibody-binding spe-
cificities.  Therefore,  at  least a  few animals in  any population will be
capable of recognizing any antigen. It is this randomness, however, that
generates the problem of responding only to foreign macromolecules.
If the generation of the ability to recognize diverse antigens is random
and  not  explicitly  encoded  in  the  DNA,  the  same  randomness  will
generate antibodies against the organism itself, and these self-recogniz-
ing antibodies must be eliminated if the animal is to survive.

The problem of preventing self-recognition is largely solved by killing
the lymphocytes that recognize macromolecules of the organism itself.
This, of course, must be done after development of the immune system
but  before  the  organism  is  exposed  to  foreign  macromolecules.  For
purposes of the molecular biology of the immune system, it is useful to
consider  the  following  simplified  picture  of  the  development  of  an

animal’s lymphocytes (Fig. 20.1). Eventually in the cells deriving from
a  fertilized  egg,  there  arises  a  single  cell  that  can  be  considered  the
precursor of the T and B cells. Subsequent divisions of this cell produce
only T and B cells. Each of the T or B cells generally develops the ability
to recognize only one antigen. Some of these antigens are macromole-
cules present in the animal itself. The lymphocytes that recognize these
“self” antigens are either killed or made unresponsive. The time of such
deletion or inactivation varies with the animal. In mice this occurs at
about  the  time  of  birth,  whereas  in  humans  it  is  much  earlier.  The
lymphocytes capable of synthesizing antibodies to antigens not present
at this time survive and form the pool of immature T and B lymphocytes
that are capable of responding to foreign antigens.

The consequences of incomplete killing of lymphocytes that recog-
nize “self” or the subsequent alteration  of  specificity  so that “self”  is
recognized  are  predictable.  In  either  case  the  immune  system  turns
against the animal, and autoimmune conditions result. Autoimmunity
is not at all uncommon. Forms of diabetes mellitus result from improper
recognition  of  pancreatic  cells.  Myasthenia  gravis  is  a  condition  in
which antibodies are directed against muscle-nerve connections, and
systemic  lupus  erythematosus  is  a  disease  in  which  antibodies  are
directed against many cellular components. Many other examples are
also known. Autoimmune conditions also appear to result from loss of
the ability to repress activation of T or B cells.

The Number of Different Antibodies Produced 

How many antibodies with different specificities can be generated by a
single mouse or human? If the number is small, then all the information

Myelomas and Monoclonal Antibodies   567

for their synthesis could be explicitly stored in the genome, however
unwise this would be, but if it is very large, some other mechanism must
be  used  for  generation  of  the  diversity.  A  straightforward  physical
measurement made with mice provides an estimation of the lower limit
in the number of different antibodies animals are capable of synthesiz-
ing.

After injection of mice with phosphocholine linked to a macromole-
cule, antibodies are induced. Isoelectric focusing shows that the serum
then contains  more than 100  different antibodies capable of binding
phosphocholine. Each of these has a somewhat different binding speci-
ficity. Furthermore, the levels of each of these 100 antibodies have been
increased  by  at  least  a  factor  of  100  compared  to  their  level  before
injection. Together these induced phosphocholine-binding antibodies
constitute about 1/200 of the total antibody protein in the serum of the
mice.

These numbers lead to the estimate that mice can synthesize antibod-
ies with more than 2 × 106 different specificities. The reasoning is as
follows. Let N be the number of different antibodies present in a mouse.
If these are all synthesized in nearly the same levels, each constitutes
about 1/N of the total antibody protein in the serum. If one particular
antibody is induced by a factor of 100, that one then constitutes 100/N
of the total serum. The 100 different induced phosphocholine-specific
antibodies then constitute 100 × (100/N) of the total antibody protein in
the serum, which is about 1/200 of the total. That is, 100 × (100/N) =
1/200, or N = 2 × 106. If the mechanisms of antibody synthesis required
one gene for each different antibody specificity, these numbers would
necessitate that a sizable portion of the genome be used to code for the
immune system,

2 × 106 genes × 103 

nucleotides

 = 2 × 109 nucleotides.

Myelomas and Monoclonal Antibodies 

The tremendous diversity in antibody specificities present in the serum
of  an  animal  precludes  any  simple  study  of  homogeneous  antibody.
Although  purifications  based  on  binding  to  an  antigen  might  be  at-
tempted for obtaining antibody with one specificity, the resultant anti-
bodies  would  still  be  highly  heterogeneous,  for  many  different
antibodies normally are induced by a single antigen. Even a molecule
as  simple  as  phosphocholine  can  induce  synthesis  of  hundreds  of
different  antibodies.  Instead  of  pursuing  the  purification  of  a  single
antibody out of the thousands that are induced, researchers have made
use of a cancer of the immune system to obtain homogeneous antibod-
ies.

A lymphocyte with unregulated cell division generates a cancer called
myeloma. The serum of patients with myeloma contains high concen-
trations of one single antibody. Myelomas can also be induced in mice,
and the cancerous cells can be transferred from mouse to mouse. The

ascites  fluid  collected  from  such  mice  is  a  solution  of  almost  pure,
homogeneous  antibody.  A  particular  myeloma  can  be  indefinitely
propagated, and its corresponding antibody can be easily purified and
studied.

The major problem with the use of myelomas is that their antigens
are unknown. Of course, it is possible to screen hundreds of myeloma
antibodies against thousands of potential antigens to find a molecule
the antibodies bind to, but this does not prove to be highly successful.
It would be ideal to be able to induce a myeloma for any desired antigen.
This can be done. Milstein and Kohler discovered that the immortality
of  a  myeloma  cell  line  can  be  combined  with  the  selectable  antigen
specificity of antibodies that are obtained from B cells of immunized
animals. If a variant myeloma line has been used that itself does not
produce antibody, the result of the fusion is a cell line that synthesizes
a single type of antibody. This has the desired binding specificity. The
cell  line  can  be  grown  in  vitro  or  injected  into  mice,  giving  them
myeloma but providing a convenient source of large quantities of their
antibody product. The antibodies produced by these means are called
monoclonal because they derive from a single cell or clone.

Mouse cell lines synthesizing monoclonal antibodies are isolated by
fusing myeloma cells with lymphocytes extracted from the spleen of a
mouse about five days after its immunization with the desired antigen
(Fig. 20.2). The cell fusion is accomplished merely by mixing the two
cell  types  in  the  presence  of  polyethylene  glycol.  This  agent  induces

The Structure of Antibodies   569

fusion of the cell membranes; after an interval of unstable growth in
which a number of chromosomes are lost, relatively stable chromosome
numbers, called karyotypes, are established in the population. To re-
duce  the  background  deriving  from  growth  of  unfused  parental  cell
types, a genetic selection against both of the parental cell types is used
so that only a fusion product can grow. The fused cells are then diluted
to a concentration of a few cells per well of a culture tray, and after they
have had time to grow and secrete antibody to the growth medium, the
individual  cultures  from  the  wells  are  screened  for  the  presence  of
antibody with the desired specificity.

Monoclonal antibodies find wide use in diagnostic and therapeutic
medicine and in many types of basic research. In addition to providing
an almost limitless supply of antibody with unchanging characteristics,
monoclonal technology permits antibodies to be made against materials
that cannot be completely purified. For example, monoclonal antibod-
ies can be made against the cell walls of neurons from an animal. The
neurons are dissected out, cell walls isolated and injected into a mouse,
and  the  fusion  of  spleen  cells  to  the  myeloma  line  performed.  Even
unfractionated brain could be used for the initial injections. The anti-
bodies  synthesized  by  the  fused  cells  can  be  screened  for  desired
properties.  Some  of  the  resulting  monoclonal  antibodies  have  been
found to bind to all cells, some bind only to neurons, and others bind to
just a few neurons. Presumably neurons of the latter class are closely
related to one another in lineage or function.

The Structure of Antibodies 

Determining  the  amino  acid  sequences  and  three-dimensional  struc-
tures of antibodies has greatly helped our understanding of how they
are encoded by a reasonable number of genes and how they function.
Although eight major classes of human antibody are known, this chapter
deals primarily with the IgG group which contains IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b,
and  IgG2a.  This  is  the  most  prevalent  antibody  in  serum.  The  other
antibodies are IgM, the first detectable antibody synthesized in response
to an antigen, IgD, IgE, and IgA. These have slightly different structures
and apparently are specialized for slightly different biological roles. IgG
contains  four  polypeptide  chains,  two  identical  light,  or  L,  chains  of
22,500 molecular weight, and two identical heavy, or H, chains of about
50,000  molecular  weight,  giving  a  structure  H2L2.  Two subclasses  of
light  chains  are  known  in  mouse  and  humans,  kappa  and  lambda,
whereas the eight major immunoglobulin classes are determined by the
eight types of heavy chain, M, D, G3, G1, G2b, G2a, E, and A.

The chains of IgG are linked by inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds
into a Y-shaped structure (Fig. 20.3). Papain digestion of one mole of
IgG yields two moles of Fab fragments and one mole of Fc fragment.
The  “ab”  indicates  that  these  fragments  possess  the  same  binding
specificity as the intact IgG antibody, and the “c” indicates that these
fragments are readily crystallizable. Analysis of fragments of IgG has

been highly important because fragments are much more easily studied
than the intact IgG molecule.

The  amino  acid sequences  of  both  the  L and  the H chains  of IgG
isolated from myelomas revealed an astonishing fact. About the first 100
amino acid residues of each of these chains are highly variable from
antibody to antibody, whereas the remainder of the chains is constant
(Fig. 20.4). Even more remarkable, however, is the finding that three or
four regions within the variable portion of the protein are hypervariable.
That is, most of the variability of the proteins lies in these regions. In
view of their variability, such regions are likely to constitute the anti-
gen-binding site of the antibody molecule. This suspicion was confirmed
by affinity labeling of antibodies with special small-molecule antigens
that chemically link to nearby amino acid residues. They were found to
link to amino acids of the hypervariable portions of the L and H chains,
just as expected.

Proteins from myelomas also assisted the X-ray crystallography of
antibodies. Without the homogeneity provided by monoclonal antibod-
ies, the crystal  structures of antibodies could never have  been deter-

mined. The structure of Fab fragments confirms most of the postulates
that the amino acid sequence raised. The hypervariable portions of the
L and H chains together form the antigen-binding site at the end of each
arm  of  the  antibody  molecule  in  a  domain  formed  by  the  variable
regions (Fig. 20.5). In addition, the constant region of the L chain and
the first  constant region, CH1, of the  H  chains form  another  domain
(shown earlier in Fig. 20.3). The constant regions CH2 and CH3 of the two
heavy chains form two additional domains of similar structure.

The fact that the variable portions of the L and H chains together
form  the  antigen-binding  site  greatly  reduces  the  number  of  genes
required  to  specify  antibodies.  If  any  one  of  1,000  L  chains  could
combine with any one of 1,000 different H chains, then a total of 2,000
different genes could code for antibodies, with a total of 1 ×  106 different
binding  specificities.  The  next  sections  describe  how  B  lymphocytes
combine small numbers of segments of the L and H genes to generate
large  numbers  of  different  L  and  H  genes,  which  then  generate  still
larger numbers of antibodies because an L chain can function with most
H chains. Techniques similar to those used for study of the antibody
genes  from  B  cells  have  also  been  applied  to  the  identification  and
analysis  of  clones  containing  the  genes  encoding  the  T  cell  antigen
receptors. These proteins also contain two polypeptides with variable
and constant regions, and DNA rearrangements during the ontogeny of
the organism also generate diversity.

Many Copies of V Genes and Only a Few C Genes 

The patterns of sequence variability of the first 100 residues of the L and
H chains and the constancy of the remainder of these chains suggested
that the  genes for L and  H proteins were split  into two parts. The V
regions could then be encoded by any one of a set of different V region
segments; upon differentiation into lymphocytes, one particular V re-
gion segment would be connected to the appropriate constant region
segment  to  form  a  gene  coding  for  an  entire  L  or  H  chain.  Such  a

572  Generating Genetic Diversity: Antibodies

proposal  should  be  readily  verifiable  by  the  techniques  of  genetic
engineering.

Cloning DNA coding for the V and C regions was not difficult. Since
antibodies are secreted, they are synthesized by ribosomes attached to
the endoplasmic reticulum of lymphocytes. Therefore, isolation of poly-
A  RNA  from  membranes  of  mouse  myeloma  cells  yielded  an  RNA
fraction greatly enriched for antibody messenger. This was then con-
verted to cDNA with reverse transcriptase and cloned. Sequencing of
the clones provided positive identification of those that contained the
immunoglobulin genes. While this approach provided DNA copies of
the mature RNA that is translated to form immunoglobulin, it did not
directly indicate the status of the portion of the genome that encoded
the RNA.

Southern transfer experiments done by Tonegawa and by Leder using
fragments of cloned cDNA as a probe showed three facts about the genes
involved  with  immunoglobulin  synthesis.  First,  any  single  V  region
sequence possesses detectable but variable homology with up to about
30 different V region segments in the genome. The total number of V
region coding segments in the genome can then be estimated from the
numbers of such segments sharing homology to more than one V region
probe.  Results  of  such  experiments  indicate  that  the  genome  of  the
mouse contains from 100 to 1,000 kappa V region genes, with the most
likely number being about 300. The second result from the Southern
transfer experiments was that the genome contains much smaller num-
bers  of  the  C  region  genes.  The  mouse  genome  contains  four  of  the
lambda subclass C region L genes and only one of the kappa subclass.
The astounding third result obtained from Southern transfers was that
the  genome  in  the  vicinity  of  a  V  and  C  region  gene  undergoes  a
rearrangement during differentiation from a germ line cell to a lympho-
cyte. That is, the size of DNA fragment generated by digestion with a
restriction  enzyme  and  containing  homology  to  a  V  region  differed
between  DNA  extracted  from  embryos  and  DNA  extracted  from  the
myeloma source of the cDNA V region clone.

Answering deeper questions about the structure and rearrangements
of the genes involved with antibody synthesis required additional clon-
ing. Copies of undifferentiated V and C region genes could be obtained
by cloning DNA isolated from mouse embryos. The differentiated copies
could  be  obtained  by  cloning  from  myelomas.  DNA  extracted  from
mouse embryos and myelomas was cloned in lambda phage, and the
plaques were screened for those containing DNA homologous to the V
or C region from the cDNA clone. The results of these experiments in
conjunction with the Southern transfer experiments showed that in the
germ  line  cells,  the  C  and  V  region  genes  are  situated  far  from  one
another. In a myeloma cell, however, a DNA rearrangement has placed
the  expressed  V  and  C  region  genes  beside  one  another.  After  the
rearrangement, they are separated by only about 1,000 base pairs. An
R-loop between light chain mRNA and the rearranged DNA shows the
V  and  C  region  genes  separated  by  an  intervening  sequence  plus  an

The J Regions

additional portion of V region gene called V’. This codes for the leader
sequence that is required for secretion of the polypeptide.

The segments of embryonic DNA encoding the V regions of both the
lambda and kappa light chains of mouse IgG do not code for about 13
amino  acids  normally  considered  to  be  the  last  part  of  the  variable
region of the protein. The sequence of the embryonic C region DNA does
not  solve  the  problem,  for  it  contains  just  the  amino  acids  that  are
constant from antibody to antibody. The missing amino acids have been
found to be encoded by a segment of DNA lying from 1 to 3 kilobases
(Kb) upstream from the 5’ end of the C region gene. This region is called
the J region because it is joined to the V region in the process of DNA
rearrangement that connects a V and C region pair.

Of course, the most direct demonstration of the existence of a J region
was provided by sequencing. But Tonegawa had first performed R-loop-
ing to locate the J region approximately. Light chain messenger from
myelomas was hybridized to C region DNA cloned from embryos (Fig.
20.6).  The  R-looped  structures  of  the  lambda  chain  located  a  short
region with the necessary coding properties about 1,000 to 3,000 nu-
cleotides upstream from the C region. By contrast, kappa light chain
mRNAs extracted from a series of myelomas indicated the existence of
four different J regions ahead of the kappa C segment. Thus the presence
of  these  J  regions  adds  another  means  for  generation  of  antibody

diversity. Any of the several hundred V segments can be linked to the C
segment by any one of the four J regions. Since the J regions of the light
chains lie just beyond the third hypervariable region of the antibody,
variability  in  this  position  has  a  direct  effect  on  the  structure  of  the
antigen-binding  site  of  the  resultant  antibody  and  the  affinity  of  the
antibody-antigen binding.

While nucleotide sequencing revealed a total of five kappa chain J
regions,  sequencing  of  myeloma  proteins  showed  that  one  of  the  J
regions is not functional. This finding is in keeping with the absence of
a GT sequence at the beginning of a splice site on this potential J region
gene.

Nucleotide sequencing by Leder demonstrated that additional diver-
sity  was  also  generated  in  connection  with  the  J  regions.  The  DNA

crossover site that connects the V segment to one of the J regions is not
fixed.  Slight  variability  in  its  position  creates  codons  not  present  on
either the V or the J segment being joined (Fig. 20.7).

The J region and the surrounding sequences are special. Immediately
upstream  of  the  J  region  itself  lie  signals  that  are  used  in  the  DNA
splicing of a V region to the J region (Fig. 20.8). Then, immediately after
the  J  region  are  the  nucleotides  that  signal  the  mRNA  processing
machinery so that the intervening sequence of about 2,500 bases be-
tween the J region and the beginning of the C region can be removed
and  the  messenger  can  be  made  continuous  for  translation.  Later
sections  explain  two  additional  functions  of  this  region:  activating
transcription and serving as one end of a deletion that changes the C
region joined to the V-J region.

The D Regions in H Chains 

The  heavy  chains  of  mice  and  humans  have  also  been  examined  to
determine whether they are spliced together from segments as are the
light chains. Indeed, the heavy chains are. About 300 variable H chain
segments  were  found  as  well  as  four  J  regions  in  mice  and  ten  in
humans. There also exists a stretch of C regions, one gene for each of
the constant region classes. These segments, however, do not encode all
the amino acids found in the heavy chains. Thus it seemed likely that

an additional segment of DNA is spliced in to generate the complete
immunoglobulin heavy chain. These segments are called D, for diver-
sity, because they lie in the third hypervariable region of the heavy chain.
Almost the same strategy as was used to find the J regions worked in
finding the missing segments of the heavy chains. Tonegawa had ob-
served  that  the  J  regions  in  some  myelomas  were  rearranged  even
though they were not connected to V segments. Most likely the rear-
rangements involved the D segments. This hypothesis proved to be true.
By cloning a rearranged J region and using the D region it contained,
the D regions were located on the embryonic DNA ahead of the J regions.
One of the interesting features of the D regions is that they possess
flanking sequences of seven and nine bases separated by 12 or 23 base
pairs (Fig. 20.9) as do the sequences and spacers found alongside the V
and J regions of the light chain. These flanking sequences are recognized
by the DNA rearranging system. Cutting and joining is between a pair
of sequences, one possessing a 12 base spacer, and one containing a 23
base spacer.

Not only does introduction of J and D regions generate diversity, but
imperfections in the rearranging process itself also generate diversity.
That  is,  the  cutting  and  joining  are  not  perfect.  Often  deletions  or
insertions of several bases are made as the D segment is spliced into
position (Fig. 20.10).

amino acids. These groups of 100 amino acids  form the domains of the
protein  that  interact  with  the  portions  of  the  immune  system  that
dispose of foreign molecules bound to antibody molecules. The fact that
intervening  sequences  separate  well-defined  structural  domains  of  a
protein led to the prediction mentioned earlier that most intervening
sequences in other proteins would also be found to separate the nucleo-
tides coding for functional and structural domains of the protein. Such
a  spacing  increases the chances  that  sequences  coding for  intact do-
mains could be shuffled between proteins in the course of evolution.

Induced Mutations and Antibody Diversity 

We have seen that lymphocytes use reasonably small numbers of V, J,
and D segments to generate a large number of different genes coding
for  antibody  polypeptide  chains.  This,  plus  the  fact  that  antigenic
specificity is generated by the combination of two unrelated antibody
chains, permits an animal to synthesize millions of different antibodies.
As mentioned earlier, however, survivability of a species dictates that
antibody specificities be randomly determined. Furthermore, it is likely
that within the population of animals of one species, the genes involved
with antibody diversity should themselves be considerably more vari-
able than other genes. Such variability at a genetic locus is known as a
genetic polymorphism and indeed is observed in the antibody genes.

The evidence for variability beyond that introduced at the ends of D
segments and the variable crossover points in the splicing of J segments
is direct. In one study involving a special line of mice, myelomas whose
IgG  products  bound  phosphocholine  were  examined.  In  contrast  to
most similar situations, the light chain variable region RNAs from these
myelomas was found to hybridize to only one genomic V region. Thus,
only one V region gene encoded all the different V region RNAs. Some
of the V regions cloned from mouse myelomas were found to possess
exactly the same V region sequence as the homologous V region cloned
from embryonic mouse DNA. Others, however, differed from the em-
bryonic sequence in one or more locations. Since all the V region genes
originated  from  the same  germ  line  V  region and  the  corresponding
sequence in nonlymphocyte cells is unaltered, the slight sequence dif-
ferences represent mutations that were selectively introduced into the
gene. Some of the differences encoded different amino acids, whereas
others were neutral. Furthermore, the changes were localized to within
about 2 Kb of the V region gene. These results mean that the mechanism
responsible for  generating the mutations makes mutations randomly
but confines the changes to the immediate vicinity of the V region gene.

Class Switching of Heavy Chains 

As  mentioned  above,  the  first  detectable  antibody  synthesized  in  re-
sponse to an antigen is IgM. Later, the other classes, IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE,
and  IgA  can  be  detected.  Remarkably,  myelomas in  culture  also  can
switch the class of antibody they are synthesizing, but without changing

578  Generating Genetic Diversity: Antibodies

the  antigen  specificity.  Since  the  class  of  an  antibody  is  determined
solely by the constant region of the heavy chain, class switching must
be generated by a change in the C segment that is connected to the V,
D, and J segments.

As  mentioned  above,  following  the  J  segment,  the  chromosome
contains a series of C region segments beginning with the one coding
for the M class of immunoglobulin. This array of eight C region seg-
ments is spread over 200 Kb of DNA and possesses an order consistent
with  the  sequence  of  class  switching  that  has  been  observed.  Class
switching replaces one of the downstream C regions for the M constant
region by deleting intervening DNA. Hence, the intervening sequence
between the J and C region and sites ahead of the other C region genes
contain signals used in the generation of the deletions that produce class
switching.

Enhancers and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes 

Up to now in this chapter, we have ignored the problem of regulation
of  expression  of  the  immunoglobulin  genes.  Consider  the  300  or  so
kappa-type V regions. The cell would waste considerable resources on

the synthesis of messenger, and perhaps its translation, if each of these
gene segments were transcribed. How then can the fusion of a V segment
to a C segment activate transcription of the spliced gene and only the
spliced gene? The explanation, of course, is that each V region contains
a  promoter,  but  lacks  an  enhancer  for  activation.  The  necessary  en-
hancers are located near the C genes (Fig. 20.11). Therefore, not only
does  gene  splicing  generate  a  substantial  portion  of  the  diversity  in
antibodies, but it also activates transcription of a spliced gene. Only after
a V region has been placed near the C region is the enhancer sufficiently
close to the promoter to activate it.

Like many enhancers, those serving the immunoglobulin genes are
highly complex. Many different proteins bind to the enhancer. Some of
these  function  in  other  tissues  and  must  serve  in  a  general  way  to
activate. Others must be specific for cells of the immune system. Overall,
however, the combination of enhancer proteins present in the cells of
the immune system distinguishes these cells, and genes of the immune
system are turned on only in the appropriate tissues.

The AIDS virus is also known as the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, because of its effects on the immune system. It is a retrovirus
that ultimately proves lethal to humans. The lethal effects of this virus
derive from its crippling of the immune system by its killing of the CD4
helper  T  cells.  Without  these  cells,  the  B  cells  cannot  multiply  in
response to newly present antigens, and ultimately the infected person
dies from infections that normally are of little consequence. The virus
binds the CD4 cells with a viral coat protein specific for a transmem-
brane cellular protein unique to these cells and a few other cell types in
the human body. After binding the membrane coat of the virus fuses
with the membrane of the cell and the RNA is released within the cell

where it frequently integrates into the chromosome after its conversion
to  double-stranded  DNA. A protein encoded by  the  virus or provirus
(Fig. 20.12) enables the infected cell to fuse with other uninfected T4
cells,  at  least  in  cell  culture.  Both  infected  cells  and  cells  in  fusion
complexes ultimately are killed.

The AIDS virus is considerably more complex than the more simple
retroviruses. In addition to the gag, pol, and env genes, the virus contains
five additional open reading frames that encode proteins that activate
or repress viral protein synthesis or play other roles in the viral infection.

Engineering Antibody Synthesis in Bacteria

There are limitations to polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can
be found. Antibodies desired for special purposes, for example investi-
gation of enzyme catalysis, could require antibodies of such selectivity
that few are likely to be found by conventional methods. While animals
may  synthesize  hundreds  of  antibodies  against  a  large  antigen,  the
number is limited by the size of the B cell population. Even somatic
mutation  can  be  imagined  not  to  generate  all  desired  structures  in
antigen-binding sites of antibodies. How could vast numbers of variant
antibodies be generated for the study of antibody-antigen interactions?
One  method  for  increasing  the  number  of  antibody  specificities
available for study would be to express a large library of light and heavy
chains in bacteria. If these large libraries could be combined, then the
same multiplicative increase in diversity as occurs in nature could also
be available. Furthermore, expressing the proteins in bacteria simplifies

altering specific amino acids or mutagenizing regions of the protein.
Time and cost scales would also become much more reasonable if the
work is done in bacteria.

How might one begin to express a wide collection of light or heavy
chains in bacteria? We cannot simply take a collection of V region genes,
for most in the genome are not connected to the D or J regions and no
diversification has occurred at the splicing step. We need to clone after
rearrangement has taken place, and it would be best to clone only genes
that have rearranged. If, however, we clone from DNA, the intervening
sequences still interrupt the genes. The best approach is to clone from
the mRNA using reverse transcriptase to make DNA copies. Then the
polymerase chain reaction can be used to amplify the DNA. Due to the
high fraction of conserved amino acids in the variable and light chain
regions, it is  possible  to design  oligonucleotides that  will specifically
hybridize to regions of the genes. The oligonucleotides can also be made
with restriction enzyme cleavage sites so that later the resulting DNA
can be easily inserted into a cloning vector (Fig. 20.13).

Cleverness in designing the cloning vector also is helpful. The incom-
ing  DNA  must  be  expressed;  therefore  the  plasmid  must  contain  an
active promoter. It should be possible to regulate this promoter in case
the gene products are lethal to the cells. The lac promoter is a good one
to use. Downstream from the promoter must be a good ribosome-bind-
ing site. Beyond this it is helpful to have a sequence that will direct the
resulting protein to be secreted from the cells. Then, at last, comes the
cloning site which  is  flanked  by the two  restriction enzyme cleavage
sites. The same sites were engineered into the DNA that was amplified
by PCR.  Finally, a  translation termination  sequence is needed. Addi-
tional  factors  are  that  after  generating  libraries  of  light  and  heavy
chains, combinations of the two must be formed. Resulting vectors must

582  Generating Genetic Diversity: Antibodies

carry one light and one heavy chain with both being expressed under
control of the lac promoter (Fig. 20.14).

Screening of the recombined library for vectors carrying a light and
heavy chain that bind a particular antigen must be easy. Techniques
have been developed for screening large numbers of lambda plaques on
plates, and thus the best vector for initial screening would be lambda
phage  rather  than  a  plasmid.  Later,  once  a  desired  recombinant has
been  found,  the  light  and  heavy  chains  should  be  transferred  to  a
plasmid vector. Finally, rather than attempting to synthesize the entire
antibody molecule, just the Fab’ fragment should be sufficient for many
studies, and the probes for PCR amplification can be designed accord-
ingly.

The technology described above has worked well and libraries have
been made containing up to 106 different light chains and 106 different
heavy  chain  fragments.  These  have  been  combined  to  yield  libraries
with truly gargantuan numbers of different antibody specificities.

Assaying for Sequence Requirements of Gene Rearrangements

It  is  not  easy  to  assay  for  the  sequence  requirements  of  the  joining
signals used in the assembly of the immunoglobulins. Many copies of
these sequences exist in normal cells and it is impossible to change all
of them and then measure the new rates of recombination. An additional
difficulty in the study of the recombination process is the low rate of
recombination. Such low rates are necessary so that two recombination
events do not often simultaneously occur in one cell.

To  assay  for  recombination  we  need  a  method  that  will  permit
alteration of the relevant sequences and permit us to look at just the
genes that are recombined. One way is to design a vector that can be
transformed into cell lines established from different cell types of the
immune system. The DNA could be left a while in the cells, then removed
and transformed into E. coli, where we want to be able to detect easily
just  those  rare  DNA  molecules  that  have  been  acted  upon  by  the

site-specific  recombination  machinery  that  assembles  the  immuno-
globulin genes.

Sequence analysis has shown that the recombinant junction signals
always recombine a signal with a 12 base spacing with a signal contain-
ing a 23 base spacing (Fig. 20.15). Two products result, a coding joint
and  a  signal  joint.  Part of the  diversity of  the  immune  system  is  the
inaccuracy that is generated at the coding joint. Nucleotides are deleted
and inserted at this point. Very few such inaccuracies occur at the signal
junction.  If  one  of  the  junction  signals  were  inverted,  then,  just  like
integration and excision of phage lambda, the DNA lying between the
coding regions would not be deleted, but would be inverted.

The inversion of a DNA segment can be utilized in the design of a
vector to assay for recombinational joining. By designing the vector to
generate  inversions  rather  than  deletions,  the  products  of  both  the
coding joint and the signal joint can be preserved for further study. This
can be done by arranging that a promoter on the vector be prevented
from driving expression of a drug resistance gene by the presence of a
transcription  terminator  between  the  two  (Fig.  20.16).  Flanking  the
terminator are a pair of recognition sequences oriented so that recom-
bination inverts the DNA, thereby nullifying the terminator and permit-
ting transcription of the drug resistance gene. 

Samples  of  the  plasmid  DNA  with  the  promoter,  terminator,  and
recognition sequences, can be transformed into cells, allowed to rest
there for a long period, extracted, and then transformed into bacteria.
The total number of transformed bacteria can be assayed by the number
of  colonies  receiving  the  plasmid,  and  the  fraction  which  are  also
tetracycline resistant provides a measure of the recombination which
occurred while the DNA was within the animal cells. The results of such

584  Generating Genetic Diversity: Antibodies

experiments  show  that  bases  near  the  coding  splice  site  are  most
important, as are the spacing distances.

Cloning the Recombinase

Direct  assay  of  the  immune  system  recombinase  is  not  easy,  and
unsuccessful attempts to detect the enzyme were made for years. An
indirect approach was to seek the DNA that either codes for the recom-
binase  or  that  induces  the  synthesis  of  the  recombinase.  This  was
possible with the same trick described in the previous section. Recom-
binational joining was used to invert a sequence and permit expression
of a selectable marker. In this case, however, since the join was to occur
within animal cells not normally expressing the recombinase, cells were
transformed with vectors containing fragments of chromosomal DNA.
Any vectors that expressed the immune system recombinase would flip
the DNA sequence and express the selectable marker.

One might wonder why this experiment had a chance of working.
Why should DNA transformed into cells be any more likely to express
the recombinase than the recombinase gene resident on the chromo-
some? One might picture that DNA in the chromosome was prevented
from expressing by mechanisms similar to those that repress the yeast
mating-type  genes  at  the  HML  and  HMR  loci.  Alternatively,  newly
arriving DNA might be able to express the recombinase gene until it is
repressed just like zygotic induction of phage lambda or the P element
transposition events that occur in Drosophila just after mating. None-
theless, the assay did work, and it has been possible to detect and clone
two clustered and divergently transcribed genes that code for the recom-
binase or the recombinase activator gene RAG.

20.1. Why are some antigens precipitated by IgG, but never by Fab

fragments? 

20.2. With the introduction of as few additional postulates as possi-
ble, explain why the new antibodies elicited by repeated boostings of
the  same  animal  often  possess  higher  and  higher  affinities  for  the
antigen.

20.3.  Estimate  a  theoretical  maximum  number  of  different  kappa
antibody  specificities  an  animal could synthesize  merely  by splicing,
and without mutation, deletion, or insertion, if the animal possessed
300 VL, 10 JL, 300 VH, 10 D, and 10 JH regions. Again, in the absence of
diversity generated by variable position of splicing, deletions or inser-
tions, and introduction of mutations, why could this theoretical maxi-
mum not be achieved? 

20.4. Invent data using DNA probes homologous to just 30 different
V regions that would indicate that the total mouse genome contains 200
different V region segments.

Problems 

Problems   585

20.5. How would you interpret data obtained from sequencing a large
number of V regions of the L and H chains that showed that about 10
amino acid residues of each chain were absolutely invariant?

20.6.  Sketch  the  structure  of  an  R-loop  formed  by  annealing  IgG

heavy chain mRNA and its genomic DNA.

20.7. Suppose you have a cDNA clone containing a V region and you
wish to identify a clone containing its embryonic V region gene. Con-
sidering  that  a  number  of  genomic  V  genes  will  possess  appreciable
homology  to  the  V  region  on  the  cDNA  clone,  how  could  a  clone
containing the desired V region be identified without sequencing? 

20.8.  Devise  a  method  using  known  enzyme  activities  by  which
lymphocytes could hypermutate DNA in the vicinity of the appropriate
recombined V(D)JC gene. The mutations must be concentrated in the
area, and restricted to only the one recombined gene region.

20.9. The somatic mutations in a V region gene are confined to the
one linked to the C region gene. Why is it logical that IgM not possess
these mutations and that only the classes that are generated after IgM
possess them? 

20.10.  Hypothesize  a  mechanism  for  splicing  the  V,  J,  D,  and  C
regions  together  based  on  the  sequences  and  spacings  between  the
flanking conserved nucleotides of these regions.

20.11. What is the importance of knowing the orientation of the V

segments on the chromosome relative to the D, J, and C segments?

20.12. No mention was made of the fact that mouse and human cells
are diploid. What is  a likely reason and explanation for the fact that
lymphocytes synthesize only one antibody type despite the fact that with
two chromosomes they could synthesize two or more types?

20.13. How would you look for the DNA that encodes the carboxy
terminal amino acids that anchor the membrane-bound forms of anti-
body?

20.14. Without sequencing or cloning, how could you test the idea
that class switching results from RNA processing and not from DNA
rearrangements?

20.15. What techniques might one use to increase the chances that a
collection of “in vitro” monoclonal antibodies might contain the desired
specificity?

20.16. About what fraction of the human or mouse genome would be

required to code for 2 × 106 average-sized genes?

20.17. On the vector used to examine recombinational joining why
would  it  be  sensible  to  place  a  DNA  sequence  that  would  lead  to
replication of the DNA while it was in the cultured animal cells?

20.18. Beyond the gene encoding the immunoglobulin recombinase
are seven AUUUA sequences (See Cell 46, 659-667 1986). Why might
this be?

Biological Assembly,
Ribosomes and Lambda
Phage

21

We  have  already  dealt  with  biological  assembly  in  the  folding  of
polypeptide chains.  In  that  case,  although we do not understand  the
process well enough to predict how a sequence of amino acids will fold,
we have some of the basic principles well in hand. For most proteins,
folding in the environment of the cell or in physiological buffers appears
to be completely specified by the polypeptide itself. No external folding
engine  or  scaffolding  is  required  although  some  of  the  heat  shock
proteins  assist  folding  by  binding  to  proteins  in  unfolded  states  and
preventing their irreversible aggregation. Is it also true that large bio-
logical structures themselves contain all the information for their for-
mation, or are scaffoldings and blueprints somehow needed?

Two fundamentally different types of larger structures are considered
in  this  chapter:  the  structure  and  assembly  of  ribosomes  and  the
structure  and  assembly  of  lambda  phage.  As  we  saw  in  Chapter  7,
ribosomes consist of two nonidentical subunits, each containing one or
two RNA molecules and many different ribosomal proteins. The great
majority of these proteins are present in each ribosome as a single copy.
Thus,  ribosomes  are  irregular  and  asymmetric.  On  the  other  hand,
lambda phage, and most other viruses, possess a highly regular coat that
covers DNA or RNA molecules. The coat of lambda consists of many
copies of a few proteins that form an icosahedral head in addition to a
number of other proteins that form a tail and tail fibers for absorption
to cells. Both in the case of ribosome assembly and in the case of virus
assembly, one important fundamental problem is determining the as-
sembly order.

592  Biological Assembly, Ribosomes and Lambda Phage

A. Ribosome Assembly

RNAse and Ribosomes

Originally,  RNAse  I  contaminating  most  preparations  of  ribosomes
caused much trouble in the study of ribosomes and their constituents.
One  might  ask  how  the  ribosomes  could  function  in  vivo  without
degradation if they are so quickly degraded in vitro. The answer is that
RNAse I is located in the cell’s periplasmic space. There it does no harm
to the ribosomes until the cells are lysed and it is released, whereupon
it adventitiously binds tightly to ribosomes and degrades their RNA. The
degradation is rapid at room temperature or above, but even occurs at
temperatures near 0°.

Molecular biologists used two sensible approaches to solve the RNAse
problem.  The  first  was  a  classic  case  of  applying  genetics  to  solve  a
biochemical problem—isolate an RNAse I- mutant. This was not a trivial
task  because  no  genetic  selection  was  apparent  for  permitting  the
growth of just RNAse I- mutants, nor was any physiological trait likely
to  reveal  the  desired  mutants.  The  only  known  characteristic  of  the
desired mutants would be their lack of RNAse I in the periplasmic space.
The  obvious  solution  to  the  problem  of  isolating the  desired  mutant
under  the  circumstances,  but  apparently  not  one  used  before,  was
merely to use a brute-force approach and score several thousand can-
didate colonies from a heavily mutagenized culture for absence of the
enzyme.

To  minimize  the  work  of  scoring,  the  mutagen  had  to  be  highly
effective. Fortunately, nitrosoguanidine can induce multiple mutations
into  each  cell.  As  a  result,  any  mutant  lacking  a  nonessential  gene
activity can be found in a population of a few thousand candidates from
nitrosoguanidine-mutagenized cultures. The work required to perform
conventional RNAse I assays on several thousand different cultures is
large. Therefore Gesteland devised two simple scoring methods. In one,
the  whole  cells  from  individual  colonies  grown  from  a  mutagenized
culture were resuspended at 42° in buffer containing radioactive ribo-
somal RNA and EDTA. The high temperature and the EDTA released
the RNAse from the cells without lysing them. Then, after an incubation
in the presence of radioactive RNA, the undegraded RNA was precipi-
tated by addition of acid, and its radioactivity was determined. Several
hundred colonies per day could be assayed for the ability of their RNAse
I to degrade the RNA. The second scoring method used a clever plate
technique in which duplicate plates contained the colonies to be tested.
One  was  overlaid  with  several  milliliters  of  agar  containing  a  high
concentration of tRNA and EDTA and was incubated at 42°. During a
few hours of incubation, those colonies containing RNAse I digested the
tRNA to short oligonucleotides. The mutant colonies lacking RNAse I
could not digest the tRNA in their immediate vicinity. Then the plate
was flooded  with  concentrated HCl. The  acid  precipitated  the  tRNA,
leaving  the  plate  opaque  except  in  the  areas  surrounding  colonies

containing RNAse I. The desired RNAse I- colonies lacked cleared halos
and could easily be detected.

The  second  approach  for  elimination  of  RNAse  I  problems  was
biological. A number of different bacterial strains were examined for
this enzyme. Strain MRE600 was found to lack the enzyme. Therefore
this strain has been used as a source of ribosomes in some structural
and assembly studies.

The Global Structure of Ribosomes

The topic of in vivo assembly or in vitro reassembly cannot be studied
without some knowledge of the structure being assembled. Learning the
structure  of  ribosomes  has  been  a  tantalizing  problem.  Most  of  the
interesting  details  of  ribosomes  are  too  small  to  be  seen  by  electron
microscopy, but ribosomes are too large for application of the conven-
tional physical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance or other
spectroscopic  methods.  Although  crystals  of  ribosomes  have  been
formed for X-ray crystallography, it will be a very long time until these
yield detailed structural information.

One of the first questions to resolve about ribosome structure is the
folding  of  rRNA.  It  could  be  locally  folded,  which  means  that  all
nucleotides near each other in the primary sequence are near each other
in  the  tertiary  structure  (Fig.  21.1),  or  it  could  be  nonlocally  folded.
Recall  that  many  proteins,  IgG  for  instance,  are  locally  folded  and
contain localized domains, each consisting of a group of amino acids
contiguous in the primary sequence. Ribosomal RNA possesses a se-
quence that permits extensive folding, most of which is local but a part
of which is nonlocal. Many stretches of the RNA can form double-helical
hairpins.  The  remainder  is  single-stranded  in  the  form  of  small  or
medium sized regions separating double-stranded regions of comple-
mentary  sequences  (Fig.  21.2).  Several  lines  of  evidence  support  the
secondary  structure  which  is  predicted  primarily  on  the  basis  of  se-
quence.  One  of  the  most  compelling  is  interspecies  or  phylogenetic
sequence comparisons. Frequently, a stretch A1, which is postulated to
base pair with stretch B1, is altered between species. In such a case, the
sequences of A2 and B2 in the second species are both found to be altered

so as to preserve the complementarity. Such compensating sequence
changes are a strong sign that the two stretches of nucleotides are base
paired in both organisms (Fig. 21.3). Additional evidence supporting the
secondary structure predictions is the locations of sites susceptible to
cleavage by RNAses or to crosslinking. The cleavage sites of RNAse A
lie in loops or in unpaired regions. Crosslinking portions of the rRNA
with psoralen, a  chemical  which  will  intercalate into helical DNA  or
RNA and covalently link to nucleotides in the presence of UV light, joins
regions postulated to be paired and also connects nucleotides that are
in close proximity because of the tertiary structure of the ribosome.

One of the most obvious methods for obtaining structure information
on ribosomes is to look at them in the electron microscope. Due to its
small size, a ribosomal subunit looks like an indistinct blob. One can,

however,  see  several  discernible  shapes  of  blob,  suggesting  that  the
subunit is not symmetrical and that it binds to the support in only a few
discrete orientations, much like a book resting on a table. As a result, it
is  possible  to  average  a  number  of  images  using  electronic  image
processing.  It  is  even  possible  to  subtract  the  averaged  image  of  a
ribosome from the averaged image of a ribosome plus tRNA to reveal
the binding location of a tRNA molecule.

Individual ribosomal  proteins  can also be marked with antibodies

and located by microscopy. IgG is bivalent, so it will join two ribosomal
subunits. Owing to the asymmetry of the subunits, the position at which
the two are linked by the antibody can often be ascertained. Not only
can  many ribosomal  proteins  be  located, but the exit site of nascent
polypeptide chains has been found through the use of antibodies to a
nonribosomal protein whose synthesis can be highly induced (Fig. 21.4).
Other features located by this method are the 5’ and 3’ ends of the rRNAs,
dimethyl A residues, translation factor-binding sites, and tRNAs.

Assembly of Ribosomes

How are ribosomes formed? We would like to have an answer to this
question concerning in vivo assembly because we want to know how

596  Biological Assembly, Ribosomes and Lambda Phage

things work. We also would like to be able to carry out in vitro assembly
so that we can perform sophisticated experiments on the structure and
function of ribosomes.

Study of the in vivo assembly of ribosomes is difficult because the
experimenter can do so little to alter the system. One or two ribosomal
precursors can be distinguished from mature ribosomes on the basis of
their sedimentation velocities. They contain only a subset of the com-
plement or ribosomal proteins. Additionally, since RNA is methylated
in a number of positions, the degree of methylation of RNA extracted
from the precursors can be measured. Not surprisingly, such studies
have not greatly illuminated the subject of ribosome assembly.

Nomura made pivotal contributions to our understanding of in vitro
ribosome assembly. As a first step in the attack on this difficult problem,
he removed a few proteins from ribosomes and learned how to replace
them  and  restore  the  ribosome’s  ability  to  synthesize  protein.  The
proteins  of  the  smaller  ribosomal  subunit  were  separated  into  two
classes: those few that split off the 30S subunit when it is centrifuged to
equilibrium in CsCl and the remaining cores that contain the 16S rRNA
and  the  majority  of  the  smaller  subunit’s  proteins.  He  then  tried  to
reassemble the ribosomes from these two fractions. The assay of assem-
bly was sedimentation velocity of the products or their ability to func-
tion in an in vitro translation assay.

The next step in the study of ribosome assembly was the reconstitu-
tion from isolated rRNA and ribosomal proteins. The RNA was purified
by phenol extraction to remove the proteins and then extensively dia-
lyzed to remove the phenol. The ribosomal proteins were obtained by
extracting purified 30S subunits with urea and lithium chloride. This
harsh  treatment  denatures  the  proteins  but  solves  one  of  the  harder
technical  problems  in  the  study  of  ribosomal  proteins,  that  of  their
insolubility. Much time was invested by many investigators to find ways
of solubilizing these proteins. Why the proteins should be poorly soluble
under some conditions is not at all clear; perhaps they cannot achieve
their correct conformation in the absence of the correct rRNA-binding
site and, as a result, the proteins easily aggregate.

To reconstitute ribosomes, a solution containing ribosomal proteins
is slowly added to a stirred buffer containing the rRNA. In the solution
it is a race between reconstitution and aggregation. A substantial num-
ber of intact 30S functional ribosomal subunits are formed, however.
Once functional 30S subunits could be formed, optimal reconstitution
conditions could be found. Not surprisingly, they were similar to in vivo
conditions. They are about 0.3 M KCl, pH 6 to 8, and Mg++ greater than
10-3 M. Soon it became possible to reconstitute ribosomes from purified
16S  rRNA  and  the  individually  purified  ribosomal  proteins.  These
results  definitively  proved  that  ribosome  assembly  requires  no  addi-
tional scaffolding or assembly proteins that are not found in the mature
particle. The remarkable self-assembly process can be likened to assem-
bling watches by shaking their parts together in a paper bag.

One major reason Nomura succeeded where many others failed was
that he tried to reconstitute the ribosomes in buffers closely resembling

Experiments with in vitro Ribosome  Assembly  597

conditions found in vivo and at temperatures at which cells grow well,
37°. Most other workers had attempted reconstitution at temperatures
near freezing to minimize the effects of proteases and nucleases on the
ribosomes.

Experiments with in vitro Ribosome Assembly

Sophisticated experiments on ribosome structure and assembly became
possible with the ability to isolate individual ribosomal proteins and to
reconstitute ribosomes from them. For example, the concentration of
each  protein  could  be  varied  in  the  reconstitution  experiments.  This
allowed determination of the kinetic order of the reaction, that is, the
number  of  components  that  had  to  interact  simultaneously  for  the
reaction  to  proceed.  It  is  certainly  to  be  expected  that  the  assembly
process would be sequential, with proteins being added one after an-
other; the alternative case—all 21 of the 30S ribosomal subunit proteins
and the rRNA coming together simultaneously in a reaction involving
22 components—would have far too low an assembly rate. Indeed, the
probability that even a few of the components come together at once is
low. Quite surprisingly,  however, the most rate-limiting step in ribo-
some assembly is not the coming together of even two components; it
is the intramolecular rearrangement of a structure already formed (Fig.
21.5).  That is, the rate-limiting reaction is unimolecular, and its rate
relative  to  the  amount  of components present  cannot be speeded  by
increasing the concentration of any components. Such a unimolecular
step is analogous to the isomerization of RNA polymerase to form an
open complex at a promoter.

The rate of in vitro ribosome assembly is strongly temperature-de-
pendent. From this dependence, the activation energy can be calculated
to have the unusually high value of 38 Kcal/mole and is indicative of
extensive structural rearrangements. This high value also suggested that
in vivo ribosome formation also requires high energy. If so, the activa -
tion energy might be increased  in  some ribosome mutants.  This has
been found. A sizable fraction of cold-sensitive mutants in E. coli are
defective  in  ribosome  assembly.  At  low  temperatures,  such  mutants
accumulate precursors of ribosomes that contain some, but not all, of

Figure 21.5  Assembly of 30S subunits. A subset of 30S proteins and 16S rRNA
form an RI complex that then must be activated by heat to form RI✵, to which
the remainder of the ribosomal proteins bind to form the complete 30S subunit.

the ribosomal proteins. Raising the temperature allows these precursors
to mature.

Reconstitution  of  ribosomal  subunits  from  cold-sensitive  mutants
permitted  pinpointing  the  target  of  the  mutations.  They  were  in  the
ribosomal proteins. A similar approach can also be used to locate the
altered component in other types of ribosome mutations. For example,
the protein that is altered in streptomycin-resistant mutants is a protein
designated S21. The ribosomal proteins are designated by S for proteins
of the smaller, 30S subunit and L for proteins of the larger, 50S subunit.
They are numbered in the order of their locations on a two-dimensional
gel in which they all are separated from one another.

The order that individual ribosomal proteins bind to the maturing
ribosome can also be determined by in vitro assembly experiments (Fig.

21.6).  The  binding  of  the  isolated  radioactive  ribosomal  proteins  to
rRNA can be measured by sedimentation of the RNA after incubation.
Only a subset of the 30S proteins are capable of binding to the naked
16S rRNA. The complexes thus formed can then be used to determine
which  proteins  can  bind  next.  Building  in  this  fashion,  a  complete
assembly  map  of  the  ribosomal  subunits  has  been  constructed.  In
general it shows that any of several proteins can bind to the structure
at any stage  in its assembly. Also, a few of the proteins that interact
strongly during assembly are encoded by genes in the same ribosomal
protein operon (Fig. 21.7).

Determining Details of Local Ribosomal Structure

Consider the fundamental question of determining which proteins are
close neighbors in the ribosome. One direct approach to this question
is  to crosslink two proteins on the intact ribosome with bifunctional
crosslinking reagents. If two ribosomal proteins are connected by the
reagent  when  they  are  in  a  ribosome,  but  not  when  they  are  free  in
solution, it can be concluded that the proteins are near one another in
the  ribosome.  This  technique  is  fraught  with  artifacts,  however,  and
results from different laboratories frequently do not agree, leading some
to believe only those crosslinking results that have been duplicated in
more than two laboratories.

Many of the proteins that are crosslinked to each other are proteins
that depend on one another during assembly of the ribosomal subunit.
A few of these proteins are encoded in the same operons. In one case,
proteins that are adjacent to one another in the ribosome derive from
adjacent genes in the chromosome. For example, ribosomal proteins S4,
S11, and S13 lie in the same operon, S13-S11-S4. S4 and S13 and S13
and S11 crosslink, S4 and S13 interact during assembly, and together
they interact with S11 during assembly.

The ability to reassemble ribosomes from their isolated components
greatly facilitates structural studies. A ribosome can be partially assem-
bled,  for  example,  and  then  antibody  against  a  component  in  the
immature ribosome can be added. If the presence of the antibody blocks
the  subsequent  association  of  a  ribosomal  protein  added  later,  it  is
reasonable  to  expect  that  the  antibody  directly  blocks  access  of  the
protein to its site.

If all ribosomal proteins were spherical, their complete spatial ar-
rangement would be determined by knowing the distances between the
centers of proteins. Some of the requisite measurements can be made
with fluorescence techniques or slow neutron scattering. Fluorescent
molecules possess  an  absorption  spectrum such that  illumination by
photons within this wavelength band excites the molecule, which then
emits a photon of longer wavelength within what is called the emission
spectrum of the molecule (Fig. 21.8).

In vitro assembly of ribosomes can be used to construct a ribosome
in which two of the proteins contain the fluorescent probes. By illumi-
nating the rebuilt ribosomes with light in the excitation spectrum of the

wavelength  of  the  emission  spectrum  of  the  second  molecule,  the

power of the distance separating the molecules:

where R is the distance between the fluorescent molecules and Ro is a
constant that depends on the orientations of the molecules, the spectral
overlap of the fluorescent emission and excitation spectra, and the index
of  refraction  of  the  medium  separating  the  molecules.  The  method
yields the most reliable data for proteins separated by 25 to 75 Å; that
is, the method is best at determining the distances of nearest neighbors
in the ribosome.

Neutron  diffraction is  another  method of measuring distances be-
tween ribosomal proteins. This method has yielded the most informa-
tion and  the  most reliable information on ribosome  structure. It too
relies on reassembly of ribosomal subunits. Two proteins in the ribo-
some are replaced by their deuterated equivalents. These proteins are
obtained from cells grown on deuterated medium. Since the neutron
scattering properties of hydrogen and deuterium are different, an inter-
ference pattern is generated by the presence in the ribosome of the two
proteins with different scattering properties. The angular separation in
the  peaks  of  the  interference  pattern  can  be  related  to  the  distance
separating  the  two  altered  proteins  in  the  reconstituted  ribosome.

Ribosomal RNA can also be footprinted like DNA. Either bare RNA,
RNA with a few  proteins bound, or even an  intact ribosome  with  or
without a bound protein synthesis inhibitor like streptomycin can be
used. The RNA is treated with chemicals like dimethylsulfate or kethoxal
that react with unprotected nucleotides. Then the RNA is purified and
a DNA oligonucleotide that will serve as a primer for reverse transcrip-
tase is hybridized. The elongation by reverse transcriptase ends at the
modified bases, and the locations of protected bases can be determined
(Fig. 21.9).

B. Lambda Phage Assembly

General Aspects

The presence of a coat on phage lambda, and most other virus particles
as well, can be broken down into three basic problems. How is the coat
assembled? How is the nucleic acid placed inside the coat? How is the
nucleic acid released from the virus particle into the appropriate cell?
At present, partial answers are known to these questions, but it is not
yet possible even to imagine the shapes of a set of folded  proteins that
would self-assemble into a structure the size of a phage, encapsidate
DNA, and when properly triggered, release the DNA.

Not only is the structure of lambda phage dramatically different from
a ribosome, but its assembly process also is notably different. First, as
in the case of many larger viruses, one virus-encoded protein is used

602  Biological Assembly, Ribosomes and Lambda Phage

DNA inside.

during assembly but is not present in the final particle. Second, a host
protein  participates  enzymatically  in  the  assembly  process.  Third,  a
number of proteins are cleaved or covalently joined during assembly.
An interesting problem involved in phage maturation is how the DNA
is packaged in the head. There are three possible models for encapsida-
tion of the DNA in the head (Fig. 21.10). The first is condensation of the
DNA followed by assembly of the protein capsid around it. The second
is a concerted condensation of DNA and capsid components, and the
third is insertion of the DNA into a preformed capsid. Of these three
possibilities, phage lambda matures by the third.

The Geometry of Capsids

Previously, we saw that lambda’s genes are crowded together and even
overlapping  in  places.  Other  bacterial  virus  genomes  are  similarly
squeezed, and it is likely that survival of many types of viruses depends
on their packing as much information as possible into as short a genome
as possible. This being the case, it is likely that as few genes as possible
will be used to code for DNA encapsidation. What general principles
might then apply to the structure of such viruses?

A  virus  coat  could  be  constructed  like  a  regular  polyhedron.  For
example, 24 identical subunits could form a cube with one subunit at

Figure 21.11  A  cube  with
subunits at each vertex.

The Geometry of Capsids  603

Figure 21.12  A  regular  icosa-
hedron.

each corner of each face (Fig. 21.11). Note that each of the 24 subunits
would make identical contacts with its neighbors. The maximum vol-
ume that could be enclosed by a set of subunits, each making identical
contact with its neighbors, is based on the 20-sided icosahedron (Fig.
21.12). Each face could consist of three subunits. Thus the maximum
number of subunits that can be utilized to enclose a volume in which
each subunit is exactly equivalent to any other is 60. Experimentally,
however, many viruses, lambda included, are found to be approximately
icosahedral but to possess more than 60 subunits in their coats.

Caspar and Klug have investigated the structures that can be con-
structed when the constraint that each subunit be exactly equivalent to
any other is weakened to permit them to be only quasi-equivalent. That
is,  each  subunit  will  have  nearly the  same  shape, but will  still  make
homologous contacts with its neighbors. Using the same contact points
over  and  over  necessitates  that  the  final  structure  be  symmetrical.
Maximizing the similarity of contacts with neighbors necessitates that
the  structure  be  helical  or  a  variation  on  an  icosahedron.  We  shall
consider only those based on icosahedra.

The restriction to icosahedral symmetry can be most easily under-
stood  by  considering  why  some  other  symmetry  is  less  favored.  For
example, why is a large cubic structure unlikely? Suppose a large planar
network of subunits is to be converted to a cube. One of the eight vertices
of a cube can be generated by converting a point of fourfold symmetry
to a point of threefold symmetry by removing a semi-infinite quadrant
of  subunits  (Fig.  21.13).  Repeating  this  process  at  the  other  seven
vertices generates the cube. In such a structure there are three kinds of
subunit  interactions;  between  subunits  on  the  same  face,  between
subunits across an edge, and between subunits at a vertex. When the
cube contains 24 subunits, each subunit engages in each of these three
types of interactions and is equivalent to any other subunit. When the
cube possesses more subunits, however, not all subunits engage in these
three types of interactions, and the different subunits are non-equivalent
and therefore distorted with respect to one another.

A  similar  analysis  can  be  performed  if  a  plane  is  covered  with
equilateral triangles and some points of sixfold symmetry are converted
to  points  of  fivefold  symmetry.  Of  course,  if  the  fivefold  symmetric

vertices are adjacent to one another, a regular icosahedron is generated.
If the fivefold vertices are not adjacent, and a larger volume is enclosed,
then again three types of interactions are possible, but the differences
amongst  them  are  smaller,  and  hence  the  required  distortions  are
smaller than in the cubic case. Hence, nature frequently will choose to
construct virus coats based on the five and six neighbor structure. Often
the units  possessing  the  fivefold or sixfold symmetry can be isolated
intact  or  observed  as  a  unit  in  the  electron  microscope.  These  cap-
someric polymers are called pentons and hexons.

One way to view some, but not all, of the higher-order structures is
that they subdivide the equilateral triangles of the regular icosahedron.
The triangles can be subdivided into 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on, subtriangles.
Other icosahedra, however, are also possible. Consider a plane net of
equilateral triangles and unit vectors a and b (Fig. 21.14). Satisfactory
icosahedra can be constructed if one of the fivefold vertices is placed at
an  origin  and  the  second  at  position  (na,  mb),  where  n  and  m  are
integers. If we define T = (n2 + nm + m2), then the regular icosahedron
has T = 1 since n = 1 and m = 0. The number of subunits, S, in all the

icosahedra is S = 60T. Although the coat of lambda phage is based on a
T = 7 icosahedron, it uses two types of coat protein. The two bear a fixed
spatial relationship to one another as though they derived from a single

polypeptide chain with a segment removed. In addition to these pro-
teins, smaller numbers of other proteins are found in the head. Some
of these form the connection between the head and the tail.

The Structure of the Lambda Particle

The  physical  structure  of  lambda  phage  and  the  organization  of  the
genetic  map  of  lambda  show  the  same  relationship  as  the  physical
structure of the ribosome and the organization of the genetic map of
ribosomal proteins. The genes for proteins that lie near one another in
the particles often lie near one another in the genetic map (Fig. 21.15).
Even though a single species of a polycistronic messenger is synthesized
that  includes  all  the  phage  late  genes,  they  are  translated  at  vastly
different  efficiencies  closely  paralleling  the  numbers  of  the  different
types of protein molecules that are found in the mature phage particle.
The A protein, often denoted pA, in conjunction with pNu1 is respon-
sible for producing the cohesive ends of the DNA. Proteins pD and pE
are the major capsid proteins. Protein pE plus Nu3 followed by pB and
pC is able to form a precursor of the head, pNu3 is then degraded and
pD is added. In the final structure, protein pD is interspersed with equal
numbers of protein pE, that is, pD and pE are the two major capsid
proteins.  Protein  pFII  as  well  as  protein  pW  are  involved  with  steps
preparing  the  head  assembly  for  receipt  of  the  tail.  pFII  provides  a
specificity for the type of tail that is attached to the head. Protein pV is
the major structural protein of the tail. Proteins pH, pM, pL, and pK are

all involved in the transition from the tail tube to the tail fibers at the
end, which are made from pJ, pTfa, and pStf.

The Head Assembly Sequence and Host Proteins

Head precursors of lambda can be isolated by centrifugation and can
thereby  be  studied.  The  first  consists  of  pE,  pNu3,  pB  and  pC  (Fig.
21.16).  Without  pE,  nothing  forms,  and  without  pNu3,  only  large
amorphous shapes appear. The formation of this structure also requires
that about 12 molecules of the pB protein be polymerized. This is done
with  the  assistance  of  the  host  proteins  GroEL  and  GroES.  The  pB
protein ultimately forms the connector between head and tail.

In the head maturation process there is both cleavage of polypeptide
chains and fusion of chains. For example, some molecules of pB are
cleaved and some molecules of pE are fused to protein pC. The final
head is formed by  the  addition  of lambda  DNA,  its  cleavage to unit-
length molecules containing the 12-base single-stranded cos ends, and
the addition of pD on an equimolar basis to pE. Proteins pW and pFII
prepare the head for attachment of the tail. One of the functions of such
a  protein is to act  as  an  adapter between  the  hexagonal  tail  and  the
pentagonal vertex to which the tail is attached.

The protein pNu3 occupies a role predicted for many other proteins
but  thus  far  found  rather  infrequently.  It  appears  to  be  a  structural
protein and is used during the assembly of the phage particle but is not
present  in  the  assembled  phage  particle.  It  is  synthesized  in  high
quantities and forms a part of the scaffolding during formation of the
particle. In the case of lambda, this protein is cleaved after a single use,
but in some other phage the analogous protein is used more than once.
The  GroEL-GroES  protein  complex  is  a  member  of  the  class  of
proteins that assists the formation of complex protein structures. Often
these proteins possess ATPase activities. Some disaggregate oligomers
that have formed from hydrophobic interactions or prevent their for-
mation.  Others  assist the  molten globule  state  to  perform final  rear-
rangements  of  secondary  structure  elements.  The protein  DnaK  that
functions in assembling the replication complex of lambda along with
the phage P protein and the host DnaB protein, also participates in the
lambda capsid maturation reactions. Mutants with altered GroE protein

frequently fail to support the growth of not only phage lambda but also
related phage and even phage T4. In addition to failing to cleave pB,
they do not package DNA. Mutants of lambda that overcome the groE
defect  can  be  isolated.  These  are  usually  found  to  be  altered  in  the
lambda E gene. Some of the rarer groE mutations can be overcome by
compensating mutations in the lambda B gene. These results strongly
suggest that GroE protein touches the pE and pB proteins during the
maturation of the phage.

The groE mutation joins the list of other cellular mutations that may
block maturation of the phage. In addition to groE, there are also the
groP  mutations  in  the  host  cell,  which  block  DNA  replication  of  the
phage,  and  groN  mutations  which  make  the  phage  appear  to  be  N
defective. The groP mutations lie within a subunit of DNA polymerase.
Some groN mutations lie in the RNA polymerase and can be overcome
by a compensating mutation in the phage N gene.

Packaging the DNA and Formation of the cos Ends

Up  to  this  point,  we  have  not  considered  the  system  that  converts
circular  lambda  DNA,  which  is  found  in  cells,  into  the  sticky-ended
linear molecules that are found in phage particles. The termini-produc-
ing protein, the A gene product, generates the required staggered nicks
while packaging the DNA. The generation of these nicks can easily be
assayed by using a double lysogen in which both prophage are Int- or
Xis-. Normal phage excision is not possible from such a double lysogen,
but the ter system can clip an intact lambda genome out of the middle
of the two excision-defective lambda genomes (Fig. 21.17).

In experiments designed to study the effects on lambda of duplicating
portions  of  its  DNA,  a  gratuitous  duplication  of  the  cohesive  end
occurred. A study of this mutant has yielded appreciable insight into the
packaging  of  phage  DNA.  The  starting  phage  for  generation  of  the
duplications was lambda deleted of a sizable fraction of the b2 region
of the phage and containing an amber mutation in the red gene. These
were grown, and selection was made for phage containing duplications
by  selecting  denser  phage  after  separation  according  to  density  on
equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl. As expected, most of the resulting
dense phage contained duplications as shown by the following criteria:

Figure 21.18  The  structures  of  heteroduplexes  formed  between  a  lambda
containing a duplication on the left arm and a lambda containing a duplication
of the cos site. The numbers on the right indicate the number of occurrences of
the various structures.

heteroduplexes  between  strands  from  these  phage  and  strands  from
wild-type phage contained a bubble; the phage were denser than the
parental-type; and, upon growth in Rec+ cells or in Su+ cells to suppress
the red mutation, unequal crossing over around the duplication yielded
both triplications and phage lacking the duplication altogether.

If the duplication phage were grown on cells unable to recombine
and unable to suppress the phage red mutation, no change occurred in
most of the duplication phage. One duplication phage, however, was
unstable under these conditions. At an appreciable frequency it segre-
gated phage lacking the duplication. Upon heteroduplex formation, an
even more startling result was found. The duplication could appear at
either end of the phage. To distinguish the ends in these experiments,
the heteroduplexes were  formed between this  strange phage  and an-
other phage containing a duplication in the left arm. In all cases, one
duplication bubble was formed in the left half of the molecule and an
additional bubble, that from the duplication in the strange phage, was
found near the right or left end.

A number of types of heteroduplexes were found (Fig. 21.18). Two
important conclusions can be drawn from these experiments: the phage
contains a duplicated cos site, but both cos sites need not be cleaved for
the DNA to be packaged, and packaging of the DNA proceeds from left

Formation of the Tail  609

to right. The reasoning for this is left as a problem at the end of the
chapter.

The finding of a polarized left-to-right packaging of the lambda DNA
is consistent with the in vitro packaging experiments investigating the
nature of the DNA required for packaging. These packaging experiments
found that a molecule containing only a single genome’s equivalent of
lambda  DNA,  a  monomer,  was  not  capable  of  being  packaged.  Only
polymers  of the lambda genome were capable of being packaged. In
vivo, the necessary polymers could derive from the rolling circle mode
of DNA replication or from recombination between circular molecules.
The obvious experiments were designed to discover the minimum DNA
capable of being packaged. The minimum is a lambda monomer con-
taining a sticky left end and a right cos end covalently joined to a left
cos end. These results all strongly suggest that the left end of lambda is
packaged first and the right end enters last. Since the tail is put on after
packaging of the DNA, it is natural to expect that the right end of lambda
would be contained either within the tail or just at the union of the tail
to the head; indeed, when tailless lambda phage that contain lambda
DNA are isolated and are lightly treated with DNAse, it is the right end
of  the  DNA  that  is  attacked.  All  of  this  strongly  suggests  that  upon
infection, the right end of lambda should be injected first into the cells.

Formation of the Tail

The  tail  of  lambda  is  formed  independently  of  the  head  and  is  then
attached to the head. The most striking property of tail maturation is a
mechanism that permits the tail to grow to a fixed length. First, proteins
pG, pH, pI, pJ, pK, pL, and pM interact to form an initiator of polym-
erization of the major tail protein, pV. The pV protein polymerizes on
this initiator to form the tail tube. Finally, the terminator of polymeri-
zation,  pU,  is  added.  After  this,  pZ  protein  functions,  and  the  tail  is
attached to the head. The tail fibers formed from the pTfa and pStf are
added  somewhere  in  this  sequence.  Unbeknownst  until  recently,  the
lambda  phage chosen  for laboratory work in  the  70s  and 80s  lacked
these fibers and adventitiously adsorbed, albeit slowly, via the pJ fiber
to  the  maltose  porin  in  the  outer  cell  wall.  As  a  result  of  this  slow
adsorption, the tail fiber-deficient lambda form large plaques. Perhaps
for the good of science, the resulting large-plaque morphology made it
possible to distinguish clear and turbid plaques, and hence, permitted
the study of lysogeny and its regulation.

If  mutations  in  the  tail  genes  are  present,  abnormal  tails  may  be
formed. For example, if the terminator of polymerization, pU, is absent,
then normal tails are formed, but the pZ protein cannot function and
the phage is largely inviable. Upon prolonged incubation of U- extracts,
in  vivo  or  in  an  in  vitro  reconstitution  system,  the  tails  will  extend
beyond  their  normal  length  to  form  what  is  called  a  polytail.  This
structure is sufficiently normal that the pZ protein can function on it,
and the polytail is attached to the head to yield a phage particle, but one
of  very low  infectivity. Of  course, if the pV protein is absent,  no tail

610  Biological Assembly, Ribosomes and Lambda Phage

polymerization  occurs.  Similarly,  mutations  in  any  of  the  genes  G
through M block initiator formation and therefore no tail is formed. The
pH protein of the tail undergoes proteolytic cleavage during maturation
to yield a protein called H*. Apparently the pH protein acts much like a
tape measure in determining the length of the tail. Internal deletions in
H yield phage with shorter tails.

In  vitro  P a c k a g i n g

In vitro packaging of lambda DNA is possible and, indeed, is widely used
to package restructured DNA in genetic engineering operations. Such
packaging is done by  preparing and  mixing  two highly concentrated
extracts of cells, each infected with lambda mutants incapable of form-
ing  complete  lambda  particles  or  synthesizing  DNA.  Together  these
extracts contain all the required proteins for packaging. In vitro packing
proceeds well if one of the extracts contains a head precursor formed
as a result of mutations in genes D or F. If such an extract is mixed with
an extract prepared from bacteria growing lambda-defective in the E
gene and lambda DNA is added, mature lambda are formed. This in vitro
packaging requires ATP, as would be expected from the fact that DNA
somehow is stuffed into the head.

In this chapter we have seen two extremes for biological assembly.
The  “unique”  structure  of  the  ribosome  is  generated  with  ribosomal
RNA and, except for one duplicated protein, with single copies of each
of the ribosomal proteins. On the other extreme, many phage coats are
virtually crystalline in that they contain mainly one protein used over
and  over  in  a  regular  array.  Although  we  know  many  facts  about
assembly, in reality we understand very little about the actual process.
We cannot look at the structure of a protein like the lambda coat protein
and predict that it is capable of forming a regular icosahedron. We are
also quite in the dark about understanding how nucleic acid is inserted
into phage coats. Far more remains to be learned in this area than is
already known.

21.1. (a) How would you prove that an antibiotic that blocked protein

synthesis did so by interfering with the functioning of ribosomes?

(b) How would you show that its site of action is restricted to the 30S

or 50S subunits?

(c) If the effect were on the 30S subunit, how would you tell whether
a  mutation  providing resistance  to the antibiotic altered  the  RNA  or
protein?

(d) Suppose parts a, b, and c above showed that the target was 16S
RNA. Suppose sequencing showed that all rRNA from strains resistant
to the drug were altered identically. How could this be possible in light
of the fact that E. coli has seven genes for ribosomal RNA?

21.2. Devise a method for the isolation of nonsense mutations in the
gene  coding  protein  S12.  You  might  wish  to use the  facts that some
changes in this protein produce streptomycin resistance and that strep-
tomycin sensitivity is dominant to resistance.

21.3. If the 30S ribosomal subunit were to be characterized by a set
of distances between the centers of mass of the individual proteins, what
is  a  minimum  number  of  distances  generally  required  to  specify  the
topography  of  21  proteins?  How  many  different  arrangements  are
compatible with this set of distances?

21.4. What would you conclude if it were determined that an icosa-
hedral phage hydrolyzes 30.0 ATP molecules per 10.5 base pairs of DNA
packaged?

21.5.  To  demonstrate  the  improbability  that  ribosome  assembly
requires  the  simultaneous  occurrence  of  all  21  proteins  in  a  small
volume, estimate the probability that in a solution at 10 micrograms per
ml in each of the proteins whose weight may be taken as 20,000, all 21
are present simultaneously in a sphere of radius twice that of a ribo-
some.

21.6. Suppose antibodies were made against a “purified” ribosomal
protein and used in electron microscopy to locate the ribosomal protein
on the ribosome. The microscopy located two sites 100 Å apart to which
the antibodies bound. We are left concluding either that the protein has
a  highly  asymmetric  shape  in  the  ribosome,  or  .  .  .  ?  What  simple
experiments could resolve the issue?

21.7. How would you determine which proteins lie on the interface

between the 30S and 50S subunits?

21.8. What would you conclude, and what experiments would you
perform if the nucleotide sequence at the end of the gene for ribosomal
protein  S11  and  the  beginning  of  the  gene  for  S4  were
XYZUGAXXXXXXAUG?

21.9. Of what evolutionary value is it for proteins that are adjacent in
the ribosome  to  derive  from  genes that are adjacent  on the  chromo-
some?

21.10.  How  could  an  experiment  be  done  to  test  for  ter-mediated

interchange of cos sites?

21.11. The geodesic dome (Fig. 21.19) was designed according to the
same principles as those that govern icosahedral virus assembly. How
many triangular facets would the entire sphere contain?

21.12. Where does trypsin cut peptides? What fraction of peptides
cleaved from random protein by trypsin could be expected to contain
sulphur? If cells are labeled at 10 mCi/µM in sulphur, how many counts
per  minute  would  exist  in  a  typical  tryptic  spot  of  lambda  phage  E
protein derived from 10 micrograms of phage?

a product of the A gene. How, with labeling but with no use of peptide

maps, could this be disproved? Remember that an A- mutant makes no
phage.

21.14. If the binding of lambda phage to E. coli triggers the injection
of lambda DNA, there could exist E. coli mutants capable of absorbing
lambda  but  incapable  of  triggering  DNA  injection.  How  would  you
isolate such a mutant?

21.15.  What  is  the  origin  of  the  circular  structures  with  single-
stranded tails observed in the heteroduplexes containing a duplication
of the cos site?

21.16. How do the data presented on the heteroduplexes of the cos
duplication lead to the conclusion that packaging proceeds from left to
right?

21.17. There exist bacterial groE mutants that are able to grow but
that do not support the growth of lambda phage. How could a lambda
transducing phage be isolated carrying the groE gene?

21.18.  The  single-stranded  regions  in  heteroduplexes  between
lambda  and  lambda  containing  small  duplications  are  not  found  at
unique sites; rather, they “wander.” Why? How can such a wandering
bubble be forced to appear at a unique location with another duplica-
tion?

21.19. The products of genes FII and W prepare lambda heads for
attachment  of  the  tails.  How  would  you  determine  whether  these
proteins must act in a particular order, and if they do, how would you
determine which acts first?

21.20. In a λpara transducing phage, the E. coli DNA replaced the int
gene of lambda. A double lysogen of this phage and wild-type lambda
was made, but the two phage types could not be separated by equilib-
rium density gradient centrifugation because they were the same den-
sity.  Therefore  a  double  lysogen  was  made  with  the  ara  transducing
phage and λb2. Induction of this double lysogen yielded transducing
phage  of  b2  density  and  plaque  forming  nontransducing  phage  of
wild-type density. How did the density interchange of the two phage
come about?

22

Higher organisms have the ability to sense their environment and to
process  and  store  information.  Additionally,  higher  organisms  fre-
quently show an excitatory response to a stimulus, but they adapt to
continued application of the stimulus and ultimately produce a dimin-
ished response. We shall see in this chapter that bacteria perform these
functions using a relatively small number of proteins. Some of these are
similar in structure to proteins that appear to perform similar function
in  higher  cells.  Therefore  the  principles  learned  about  these  much
simpler systems should be most helpful in understanding similar sys-
tems found in higher organisms.

Genetics, physiology, and biochemistry, the tools of molecular biol-
ogy that have been so useful in the study of relatively simple questions,
can also be applied to the study of biological phenomena as complicated
as  behavior.  Bacteria  have  been  used  in  these  studies  because  they
respond  to  their  environment  and  are  amenable  to  genetic  and  bio-
chemical studies.

Bacteria respond to their environment by swimming toward some
chemicals like sugars, amino acids, and oxygen and away from others
like phenol. This response is called chemotaxis. It involves a number of
steps.  The  bacteria  must  be  able  to  sense  the  chemical  in  question,
choose the appropriate direction to swim, and be able to swim. That is,
they  must  contain  elementary  sensors,  computers,  and motors.  How
such elements can be assembled from simple components is a major
reason for interest in such studies. A second interest is, as mentioned
above, that analogs of some of the individual components of a bacterial
system are used in other more complicated systems. It will be much
easier to learn how the bacterial systems work since genetic, physiologi-
cal, and biochemical experiments are all much quicker and less expen-
sive for these systems than for systems from higher cells.

620  Chemotaxis

In the last century, microbiologists observed chemotactic behavior
of bacteria in the microscope. Motile bacteria swim rapidly, in contrast
to nonmotile bacteria strains which vibrate slightly due to Brownian
motion.  Chemotactic  bacteria  are  motile  and  direct  their  motility  to
move  themselves  toward  attractants  and  away  from  repellents.  The
swimming  is  accomplished  by  moving  long,  slender  flagella  that  are
attached to the cell wall.

To swim in the correct direction, bacteria must be capable of deter-
mining in which direction the concentration of an attractant or repellent
increases or decreases. This means being able to measure concentration
differences and relating them to direction in space. It might appear that
one way a bacterium could do this would be to compare the concentra-
tion of an attractant at its two ends. This simple method has a major
flaw, however. If the swimming bacterium is catabolizing the attractant,
then  the  cell  surface  at  the  front  end  encounters  a  higher  average
concentration than the back end. Thus the bacterium loses the ability
to sense the external concentration of the attractant. Whatever direction
it is currently swimming seems to be the direction of increasing concen-
tration.  To  obtain  a  better  determination  of  attractant  or  repellent
gradient,  the  bacterium  can  measure  the  average  concentration  of
attractant over its entire surface and then move to a different point and
measure the concentration again. If the bacterium can retain memory
of the direction it moved between the measurements, then it can tell
whether  attractant  or  repellent  has  a  concentration  gradient  in  this
direction.  Complicating  the  situation  is  random  rotation  of  the  cell.
Brownian motion will significantly jostle the cell and reorient it on a
time scale of 3-10 seconds. Thus, in order for the “measure-swim-meas-
ure” process to work, both the “current” as well as the “less current”
concentration measurements must be completed in several seconds.

Assaying Chemotaxis

Sensitive and simple characterization of a cell’s chemotactic ability is
necessary for efficient study of the phenomenon. One straightforward
assay is the motility plates or swarm plates developed by Adler. In one
application, the medium in these plates contains the usual salts neces-
sary for cell growth, a low concentration of galactose, and a concentra-
tion of agar such that the medium has the consistency of vichyssoise.
Five hours after a drop of chemotactic cells is placed in the center, the
plate will contain a ring about two centimeters in diameter surrounding
many of the cells that remain where they were spotted. The ring expands
outward with time and ultimately reaches the edge of the plate. Usually,
a second ring also forms and moves behind the first.

The origin of the rings is straightforward. Sensitive chemical tests
show that the cells spotted in the center of the plate gradually consume
the galactose where they are placed (Fig. 22.1), but just beyond the edge
of the spot, galactose remains at its original concentration. That is, the
consumption of galactose creates a concentration gradient in galactose
at the edge of the spot. The bacteria on the edge of the spot detect this

gradient,  swim  toward  higher  galactose  concentrations,  and,  at  the
same time, consume the galactose in the new position. Consequently,
the  cells  move  outward  pursuing  and  consuming  the  galactose.  The
second  ring  that  forms on  the  galactose plates derives from bacteria
utilizing their endogenous energy sources to swim toward oxygen. If
tryptone medium is substituted for galactose salts medium, then multi-
ple rings form, the first ring from bacteria swimming toward the most
active attractant, the second toward a second attractant, and so on. In
this case also, one of the rings is formed by bacteria pursuing oxygen.
The capillary tube assay is more sensitive and quantitative than the
swarm plate assay. Instead of requiring the bacteria to produce their
own gradient of attractant concentration, the gradient is produced by
diffusion of the substrate. A short capillary tube is filled with medium
containing an attractant and is sealed at one end. The open end is pushed
into a drop of medium lacking attractant but containing cells, and the
tube is allowed to rest there an hour. As attractant diffuses out of the
mouth of the capillary, a gradient of attractant is produced in the region

(Fig. 22.2). The chemotactic bacteria in the drop near the capillary end
detect and swim up the gradient a short distance into the capillary. At
the  end  of  the  assay  the  capillary  tube  is  removed,  rinsed  from  the
outside, and the bacteria inside are blown out into a tube. These are
diluted and plated on petri plates. Since the number of bacteria having
entered  the  capillary  can  be  accurately  measured  by  counting  the
number  of  colonies  on  the  plates  after  incubation,  the  chemotactic
ability of the cells can be quantitated. Typically less than 100 nonmotile
bacteria enter the capillary. Several thousand motile but nonchemotac-
tic bacteria normally enter a capillary with or without attractant, and
as many as 500,000 chemotactic bacteria will enter a capillary tube that
contains attractant.

Fundamental Properties of Chemotaxis

The capillary tube assay permits several simple measurements delimit-
ing  methods  by  which  cells  accomplish  chemotaxis.  The  first  is  that
metabolism of attractant is not required for chemotaxis. An analog of
galactose, fucose, is not metabolized by Escherichia coli, and yet this
serves  as  an  attractant  in  the  capillary  tube  assay.  Another  line  of
evidence leading to this same conclusion is that some mutants that are
unable to metabolize galactose are still able to swim toward galactose.
Since cells can swim toward or away from a wide variety of chemi -
cals,  it  is  likely  that  they  possess  a  number  of  receptors,  each  with
different  specificity.  Therefore  the  question  arises  as  to  how  many
different  types  of  receptors  a  cell  possesses.  This  question  can  be
answered  by  a  cross-inhibition  test.  Consider  the  case  of  fucose  and
galactose. Since their structures are similar, it seems likely that cells
detect both chemicals with the same receptor protein. This conjecture

can be tested by using a high concentration of fucose in both the tube
and the drop so as to saturate the galactose receptor and blind cells to
the galactose that is placed only in the tube. Fucose does blind cells to
a galactose gradient, but it does not blind them to a serine gradient.
These findings prove that galactose and fucose share the same receptor,
but that serine uses a different receptor.

By blinding experiments and the use of mutants, nine receptors have
been found for sugars and three for amino acids (Table 22.1). The three
amino acid receptors are not highly selective, and they allow chemotaxis
of  E.  coli  toward  10  different  amino  acids.  Except  for  the  glucose
receptor, synthesis of the sugar receptors is inducible, as is the proline

receptor. The glucose, serine, and aspartate receptors are synthesized
constitutively.

The  capillary  assay  also  allows  a  convenient  determination  of  the
sensitivity of the receptors. By varying the concentration of attractant
within the capillary, the ranges over which the receptor will respond can
be easily determined. Typically, the lowest concentration is about 10-7
M, and the highest concentration is about 10-1 or 10-2 M (Fig. 22.3). It
is not at all surprising that a detection system is no more sensitive than
10-7  M.  First,  at  about  10-6  M  the  rate  of  diffusion  of  a  sugar  to  a
bacterium is just adequate to support a 30-minute doubling time if every
sugar molecule reaching the cell is utilized. The ability to chemotact
would not change this lower limit by much.

The second limitation on detection sensitivity is the lowest concen-
tration at which a sufficiently accurate measurement may be made in
the one second measurement window set by the rate of random rota-
tions. At a concentration of 10-7 M, the number of attractant molecules

reaching the cell surface is so low that statistical fluctuations in their
number  necessitate  averaging  for  a  full  second  to  obtain  sufficient
accuracy. Thus 10-7 M is about the lowest practical concentration to
which bacteria can be expected to chemotact.

The  actual  receptor  proteins  for  the  different  sugars  have  been
sought, and several have been identified biochemically. The receptors
for galactose, maltose, and ribose are found in the periplasm outside
the inner membrane but inside the peptidoglycan layer. These and other
periplasmic proteins can be removed from cells by osmotic shock.

No periplasmic binding  proteins  have been found  for the glucose,
mannitol, and trehalose systems. Instead, these systems use receptors
that  are  tightly  bound  to  or  located  in  the  inner  membrane.  These
receptors  serve  a  double  purpose  as  they  also  function  in  the  group
translocation of their substrates into the cell via the phosphotransferase
transport system.

Genetics of Motility and Chemotaxis

Mutants permit dissection of the chemotaxis system, both by allowing
observation of the behavior of cells containing damaged components of
the system and by facilitating biochemical study of the components. One
method  for  isolation  of  chemotaxis  mutants  utilizes  swarm  plates.
About 100 candidate mutant cells are diluted into a plate containing low
agar concentration, minimal salts, any necessary growth factors, and a
metabolizable attractant such as galactose. As each cell grows into a
colony,  it  generates  an  outward-moving  ring  if  the  cells  are  able  to
consume  the  attractant  and  swim  toward  higher  concentrations.  A
motile but nonchemotactic cell makes a moderately large colony with
diffuse edges, whereas a nonmotile cell makes a compact colony with
sharp edges.

Galactose-specific  chemotactic  mutants  can  be  detected  with  the
swarm plates. One type possessed an altered  galactose-binding protein.
The protein had a greater dissociation constant for galactose, as did the
galactose transport system, proving that the same protein is involved
with both galactose chemotaxis and galactose transport.

A different type of genetic selection proved useful for the isolation of
deletions and point mutations in flagellin genes. It is based on the fact
that antibodies against  flagella  stop their motion and  block  motility.
Bacterial mutants with different antigenic determinants on their flagella
are resistant to the antibody. Imagine the situation in a merodiploid cell
where  an  episome  possesses  genes  for  the  mutant  flagellin  and  the
chromosome codes for the nonmutant flagellin. Such cells will not be
chemotactic in the presence of the antibody because their flagella will
be a mosaic of both types of flagellin and their action will be blocked by
the antibody. Any mutants synthesizing only the flagellin encoded by
the episome will be chemotactic because their flagella will be resistant
to the antibody. That is, the only cells able to swim out of a spot on a
swarm  plate  containing  the  antiflagellin  antibody  are  those  whose
chromosomal  flagellin  genes  are  not  functional,  but whose  episomal

How Cells Swim  625

flagellin genes are functional. Apparently deletions are the most com-
mon method for accomplishing this.

How Cells Swim

Escherichia  coli  propels  itself  through  liquid  by  rotating  its  flagella.
Normally the flagella are left-handed helices and their rotation gener-
ates a thrust that moves the cell. In this section we consider the structure
of flagella, how it’s known they rotate, how the rotation is created, and
how the several flagella present on a single cell can function together.
Flagella are too thin to be easily seen by ordinary light microscopes,
but  they  can  be  visualized  with  light  microscopes  operating  in  the
dark-field  mode, interference microscopes, video processing, or elec-
tron  microscopes.  Careful  isolation  of  flagella  shows  that  they  are
attached to a hook-shaped structure connected to a set of rings that is
embedded in the cell’s membranes. The rings have the appearance of a
motor that rotates the flagella (Fig. 22.4). The hook is a flexible connec-
tor between the basal structure and the flagella. Such a universal joint

is necessary because in E. coli the flagella sprout from random points
on  the  cell’s  surface  and  point  in  several  different  directions.  A  cell
typically contains about six flagella. These must join together in a bundle
in a way that permits each to rotate in response to its motor. The hook
acts as a universal joint that permits the torque to be transmitted around
a bend.

Because of the size of the flagella, indirect means must be used to
demonstrate that they rotate. One simple experiment uses the observa-
tion that antibody against flagellin can block motility. More precisely,
bivalent  antibody  blocks  motility,  but  monovalent antibody  does  not
(Fig. 22.5). This result can be understood if the flagella form a bundle

and  each  flagellum  rotates  within  this  bundle.  A  bivalent  antibody
molecule  can  link  different  flagella and  prevent their rotation,  but  if
flagella waved or rotated as a group, bivalent antibodies would have an
effect no different from monovalent antibodies.

The most graphic demonstration that flagella rotate is also the basis
of many other important experiments on chemotaxis. Simon used one
mutation to block flagellin synthesis and another to permit greater than
usual  growth  of  the  hook.  As  the  synthesis  of  flagella  is  sensitive  to
catabolite repression, growth of cells in glucose reduced the number of
the resulting polyhooks from about six per cell to about one. These cells
could be bound to a microscope slide by means of antihook antibody
that had bound to the hook and nonspecifically bound to the glass as
well (Fig. 22.6). Chemotactic cells immobilized in this way rotated at
two to nine revolutions per second. This leads to the conclusion that the
hook normally rotates, but when it was fastened to the microscope slide
instead, the cell rotated. Nonmotile cells did not rotate. Of course, motile
but nonchemotactic mutants did rotate because they can swim but do
so  in  a  nondirected  fashion  and  are  incapable  of  swimming  up  a
gradient.

The immobilization experiment shows that a single flagellum rotates
and that the rotation is associated with chemotaxis. Dark-field micros-
copy has shown that the bundle of flagella on a cell is stable as long as
the flagella rotate counterclockwise. If the flagella reverse their rotation,
their left-helical structure compels the bundle to fly apart temporarily.
Furthermore, if the reversal is sufficiently vigorous, the flagella snap
into a right-helical conformation. This further ensures that the bundle
of flagella disperses.

The Mechanism of Chemotaxis

As  viewed  in  the  microscope,  chemotactic  bacteria  appear  to  swim
smoothly for about 20 bacterial lengths in 1 second, to tumble for about
0.1 second, and then to swim smoothly in another direction. How this
run-tumble-run  behavior  is  converted  to  overall  swimming  toward
increasing concentrations of an attractant was one of the major prob-
lems in chemotaxis research.

Berg constructed an elaborate tracking microscope that quantitated
the movement of a chemotactic bacterium in three dimensions. This
showed that, indeed, the impression obtained from simple visual obser-
vation was correct. Following a tumble, a cell’s subsequent run was in
a  random  direction.  More  important,  however,  was  the  behavior  of
bacteria  under  conditions  simulating  the  presence  of  a  gradient  in
attractant. It is difficult to control a gradient in the concentration of an
attractant around the cell, but it is likely that a cell detects not a spatial
gradient but the change in the concentration of attractant from one time
to the next. Therefore, Berg devised a system to vary the concentration
of attractant with time.

Alanine  aminotransferase  catalyzes  the  interconversion  of  alanine
and  α-ketoglutarate  to  pyruvate  and  L-glutamate.  Both  alanine  and

628  Chemotaxis

glutamate are attractants, and therefore the reaction cannot be used to
create  or  destroy  total  attractant.  This  problem  can  be  overcome  by
using a mutant that is blind to alanine but not blind to glutamate. Then
the enzyme-catalyzed reaction can be used to vary the concentration
with time of attractant surrounding a cell. If alanine, α-ketoglutarate,

being  observed,  then  the  concentration  of  attractant,  glutamate,  in-
creases with time. In this case, the runs of the bacteria are longer than
average. When the glutamate concentration is decreasing as a result of
adding glutamate, pyruvate, and alanine aminotransferase to the bath-
ing  medium,  the  distribution  of  run  lengths  is  the  same  as  when
attractant concentration remains constant.

The technique of immobilizing a cell via its hook or flagellum has
also been highly useful in characterizing chemotaxis responses. After
such an immobilization, a microprobe containing attractant or repel-
lent can be positioned near a cell, and application of a brief electrical
pulse will drive a known amount of the chemical into the medium in
the immediate area (Fig. 22.7). If the concentration changes are within
the linear response range of the cell, the response to a brief pulse of

attractant contains all the information necessary to predict the response
of a cell to any function of attractant concentration as a function of time.
Any  other  function  can  be  approximated  as  a  series  of  impulses  of
appropriate  magnitude,  and  the  responses  to  each  of  these  can  be
summed. Such a technique of circuit analysis is well known to electrical
engineers, but it has not yet been widely applied to biochemical systems.
All the experiments mentioned above show that cells modulate the
duration of their intervals of smooth swimming. Such a modulation is
sufficient for the cells to achieve a net drift up a gradient of attractant.
When a cell is swimming up a gradient in attractant concentration, that
is, experiencing an increase in attractant concentration, it decreases the
chances of its tumbling. When the attractant is decreasing, the average
run  duration  is  the  same  as  when  the  cell  is  in  constant  attractant
concentration.  These  properties mean that cells  drift up gradients in
attractant concentration, that is, they undergo a biased random walk,
taking  lengthened  steps  when  they  are  moving  up  the  gradient  (Fig.
22.8).

The Energy for Chemotaxis

Application of genetic and biochemical methods has allowed determi-
nation of the energy source required for chemotaxis. On one hand it
seems logical that ATP would be the direct source of the mechanical
energy  required  for  swimming  since  most  energy  transductions  in
higher cells appear to use ATP. On the other hand, the flagella originate
in the cell membrane, and a substantial proton gradient exists across
the  inner  membrane  under  most  growth  conditions.  Therefore  the
direct source of energy could also derive from the membrane potential.
ATP  and  the  proton  motive  force  across  the  inner  membrane  are
normally interconvertible  by means  of  the  membrane-bound ATPase
(Fig.  22.9).  The  membrane  potential  generates  ATP  and,  conversely,
ATP can be used to generate a membrane potential. Therefore, blocking
formation of either ATP or the membrane potential could have an effect
on the other. Arsenate permits decoupling to determine what actually

drives  the  motor  of  the  flagella.  It  blocks  ATP  formation  both  by
glycolysis and by ATPase, but does not directly affect the membrane
potential. Cells treated with arsenate are found to be motile, but they
do  not  swim up gradients of attractants.  This  shows  that  ATP  is  not
required  for  motility,  but  probably  is  involved  with  the  process  of
modulating run duration.

Next, to investigate the role of the membrane potential, cells can be
grown anaerobically. This blocks the usual means of generation of the
membrane potential because the electron transfer chain becomes inac-
tive owing to the lack of a terminal electron acceptor. Then, to prevent
energy from ATP from being used to create a membrane potential, an
ATPase-negative  mutant  can  be  used.  Anaerobically  grown  ATPase
mutants are found not to be motile, leading to the conclusion that the
motors that drive the flagella are run by the cell’s membrane potential.
Other  experiments  show  that  cells  swim  when  transmembrane  pH
gradient or membrane potentials are generated artificially.

Many sensory systems in animals adapt to a stimulus. That is, excitation
with  a  particular  stimulus  will  evoke  a  response,  but  the  response
weakens with continued application of the stimulus. An increase in the
exciting stimulus will then produce a new response, but eventually a
new adaptation occurs (Fig. 22.10). Such an adaptation phenomenon is
also observed in bacterial chemotaxis and is inherent in the machinery

a  cell  uses  for  comparing  attractant  concentrations  at  two  different
times. 

Excitation and adaptation can be simply generated by comparing the
sensor’s present signal to some average of the signal over the recent past
(Fig. 22.11). Such averaging is equivalent to a slow response, and this
provides the cell’s “memory.” Hence the instantaneous conditions sur-
rounding a cell must be compared to an average of the conditions taken
over the previous few seconds. If the concentration of attractant has
increased during that interval, the instantaneous signal will exceed the
average signal, and the comparator should produce a signal that sup-
presses clockwise rotations generated by the flagella motors. If, how-
ever, the concentration of attractant has not increased over an interval
of a few seconds, the instantaneous and averaged signals will be equal
or negative and the comparator signal will fall. Consequently, the motor
will be permitted to reverse direction at its natural frequency. In such a
direction  reversal,  the  bundles  of  flagella  come  apart,  and  the  cells
tumble and randomize their subsequent swimming direction.

Methylation and Adaptation

The biochemical components in the cell’s rapid response, adaptation
response, and signaling pathways have been found. They are phospho-
rylation and methylation of several of the proteins necessary for chemo-
taxis.  First  we  will  discuss  methylation.  Adler  had  observed  that
methionine is necessary for chemotaxis. That is, a methionine auxot-
roph grown in the presence of methionine would be chemotactic. Upon
removal of methionine, however, the cells remained motile, but could
no longer swim up gradients of attractant. Auxotrophs for other amino
acids remained chemotactic upon amino acid starvation.

The  results  discussed  above  indicate  that  methionine  plays  some
special role in chemotaxis. Later, when the mechanism of chemotaxis
was understood to be modulation in the frequency of runs and tumbles,
it was sensible to ask what methionine did. Experiments showed that
methionine-starved cells are unable to tumble. The next question was
whether methionine starvation destroyed the physical ability to tumble
or whether it eliminated the signal to tumble. At first this question seems
unapproachable.  Genetics,  however,  came  to  the  rescue.  Among  the
many  types  of  nonchemotactic  mutants  known  are  some  that  inces-
santly tumble. The question then was whether these tumbling mutants
continued to tumble during methionine starvation. All that was neces-
sary  to  answer  this  question  was  to  make  these  tumbling  mutants
methionine  auxotrophs  and  to  starve  them  of  methionine.  After  this
treatment  they  continued  to  tumble.  This  shows  methionine  is  not
necessary for tumbling, and therefore that the amino acid must be part
of a pathway that signals tumbling to occur.

How  might  methionine  be  required?  Methionine  via  S-adenosyl
methionine is a common source of methyl groups in metabolism. Most
likely,  then,  the  methionine  requirement  hints  that  methylation  is
involved in the tumbling signal. Consistent with this notion is the fact
discussed above that the addition of arsenate to cells, which blocks ATP
formation  and  hence  S-adenosyl  methionine  synthesis,  also  blocks
chemotaxis but not motility.

With such clues for the involvement of methylation in chemotaxis, it
is natural to look for methylated proteins. The level of methylation of
several membrane proteins has been found to be correlated with chemo-
taxis behavior for some attractants. The addition of attractant to cells
leads to preferential methylation of one of a set of at least four mem-
brane proteins, products of genes named tsr, tar, tap, and trg (Fig. 22.12).
These proteins are the receptors and signal transducers for some of the
attractants and repellents to which E. coli responds. For example the tar
product is the receptor for the attractants aspartate, maltose, and many
repellents.

Signaling between the receptor proteins and the intracellular chemo-
taxis machinery requires sending a signal through the membrane. The
tar protein spans the membrane. It has a domain of about one hundred
of the N-terminal amino acids outside the membrane, and about two
hundred more amino acids inside the membrane. The external portion
binds the aspartate, but it is the internal portion that is methylated by

methyl transfer from S-adenosyl methionine. As many as five glutamic
acid  residues  per  receptor  can  be  modified  as  the  cells  adapt  to  the
continued presence of attractant. The intracellular portion of the pro-
tein is highly homologous to other methyl-accepting chemotaxis pro-
teins, whereas the N-terminal portion is only weakly homologous to the
other chemotaxis receptors.

Increase in the concentration of an attractant generates a conforma-
tion change in one of these membrane-bound proteins. This change is
ultimately communicated to the flagellar motor. Increasing methylation
of the protein decreases its ability to send a signal for  smooth swimming
or increases its ability to send a signal for tumbling. It is the change in
signal  strength  resulting  from  change  in  methylation  that  produces
adaptation.

For  methylation  to  be  part  of  the  cell’s  “memory,”  at  least  two
enzymes are required: one is an enzyme to methylate and the other is
an enzyme to demethylate. More precisely, a methyltransferase and a
methylesterase must exist. Both of these have been found. They act on
the proper membrane proteins and are encoded by genes in the set of
eight or nine genes that are required for chemotaxis but are not required
for motility.

Phosphorylation and the Rapid Response

Chemotaxis requires sensing an extracellular condition and then signal-
ing to some intracellular component. A number of other systems, for
example the phosphotransfer system, the nitrogen regulatory system,
phosphate uptake system, and porin system, use similar signaling path-
ways.  These  pathways  contain  sensor  proteins  which  often  span  the
membrane  and  serve  to  couple  extracellular  conditions  to  internal
activity. The sensors are similar in structure to one another, phospho -
rylate themselves on histidine residues, and phosphorylate the regulator
proteins on aspartate residues. The regulator proteins also are similar
in structure to one another. In order that the stimulation be reversible,

another component to these systems is a phosphatase of the regulator
proteins.

In the chemotaxis system the Tar, Tsr, Trg, or Tap proteins transmit
a signal across the inner membrane. These signals are received by the
CheW  and  CheA  proteins  and  are  translated  into  varying  levels  of
phosphorylation  of  CheA.  This  was  found  by  analogy  to  the  phos-
photransfer system and a finding by Magasanik that phosphorylation
was involved with regulation of nitrogen metabolism. When the purified
chemotaxis  proteins  are  appropriately  incubated  together  in  vitro,  a
phosphate is transferred from ATP to CheA protein. To demonstrate that
this pathway is involved with chemotaxis, mutants lacking the histidine
to  which  the  phosphate  is  transferred  have  been  found  not  to  be
chemotactic.

Two further phosphorylation pathways diverge from CheA. The first
is phosphorylation of CheY from CheA. This is a rapid step that leads
to  signaling  the  flagellar  motor,  most likely  by  direct  interaction  be-
tween phosphorylated CheY protein and the motor. This reaction in-
duces tumbling. Phosphorylated CheA also leads to phosphorylation of
CheB, which demethylates the receptors.

The response of the chemotaxis pathway involves the complicated
interaction of many components (Fig. 22.13). An increase in the con-
centration  of  attractant  rapidly  decreases  the  phosphorylating  signal
from receptor to CheA-CheW, and as a result decreases the concentra -
tion  of  phosphorylated  CheY.  Tumbling  is  suppressed  and  smooth
swimming is prolonged. Additionally, the decrease in phosphorylation
of  CheA  decreases  the  phosphorylation  of  CheB  which  decreases  its
demethylation activity. As a result, but one taking place more slowly
than the first response, methylation of the receptor increases, the cells
begin to adapt, and the phosphorylation levels begin to increase. Overall,
then, the phosphorylation levels respond rapidly and transmit a signal
to the motor, and the methylation levels respond more slowly and serve

to bring the phosphorylation levels back to the levels characteristic of
the absence of attractant.

Chemotaxis is remarkable. A single cell manages to sense attractants
with receptors located outside the cytoplasm, transmit the information
to the interior, remember the information it has received so as to adapt
if the attractant or repellent concentration is no longer changing, build
and energize a motor, and synthesize a bundle of flagella that smoothly
rotate together or fly apart when necessary. The biochemical bases for
parts of the system are known. A few of the receptors have been purified,
and  the  center  of  the  adaptation  phenomenon,  the  methylation  and
phosphorylation of the proteins, is partially understood. Whether we
will  be  able  to  understand  the  underlying  physical  chemistry  of  the
protein conformational changes and the drive mechanism of the flagel-
lar motor in the years ahead is an interesting question.

22.1.  Suppose  a  strain  of  chemotactic  cells  with  no  endogenous
energy source is starved of all possible sources of metabolic energy. Why
should they swim for a minute or two after dilution from a medium
containing  a  high  potassium  concentration  to  a  medium  with  a  low
potassium concentration plus valinomycin? Valinomycin is a potassium
ionophore.

22.2. What information do we learn about the chemotaxis system by
the finding that the steeper the gradient in attractant concentration, the
faster the bacteria swim up the gradient?

flagellum changes from counterclockwise to clockwise rotation?

22.5. How fast do bacteria move when they swim?
22.6. In the case of repellent versus attractant, how could you deter-
mine whether the response to the simultaneous presence of repellent
and attractant is a momentary response appropriate to attractant and
repellent  or  an  algebraic  summation  of  the  signals  so  as  to  give  no
response at all?

22.7. Through an ordinary monocular light microscope, does a right-
handed  screw  thread  look  right-handed  or  left-handed,  that  is,  do
bacteria  rotating  clockwise  actually  appear  to  be  rotating  clockwise
when observed through the microscope?

lation Reaction in Sensory Adaptation,” M. Goy, M. Springer, J. Adler,

We have already seen that the elementary regulatory mechanisms found
in bacteria can be damaged by mutations. We would expect, then, that
in higher cells growth regulation pathways could also be damaged and
the  cell  would  either  not  grow  and  divide  or  would  grow  without
stopping. Such uncontrolled growth is seen, and is called cancer. Such
a state is expressed in cell culture as the failure of fibroblast cells to stop
growing when they have grown to form a confluent monolayer. These
cells are then said to have been transformed to a noninhibited state and
have lost their density-dependent regulation of growth. Additional prop-
erties like anchorage independent growth, growth factor-independent
growth,  cell  morphology,  and  immortality  as opposed  to  the normal
pattern of growth for only about 40 generations, can also be altered in
transformed  cells.  Cancers,  then,  give  us  a  window  into  the  normal
cellular regulatory processes. The important experimental questions are
determining the biochemical changes that cause different cancers and
then determining how these changes alter the cell growth patterns.

In an earlier chapter we saw that diffusible growth factors permit
cells in a multicelled organism to communicate in order to coordinate
growth. Differentiating cells can also regulate growth by utilizing their
lineages.  For example,  the  32 descendants  resulting from 5 cycles of
division could all be identical. On  the next  division cycle, one of  the
daughters of one of the cells could differentiate from the others and start
development of a different tissue type. This type of scheme appears to
operate in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and portions of devel-
opmental pathways in higher organisms make use of this principle as
well. It is possible to imagine mutational damage that alters the behavior
of both the signaling and lineage growth regulation schemes.

644  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

This chapter focuses on the application of principles and techniques
discussed in earlier chapters to determine the molecular alterations that
lead  to  the  cancerous  state  in  plants  and  animals.  These  studies  are
providing valuable information on the workings of normal cells and they
indicate that at least 50 genes play highly important roles in regulating
the growth of animal cells. Yet to be determined, however, is whether
the information gained from these studies will be directly applicable to
the treatment of cancer patients.

Bacterially Induced Tumors in Plants

Plants appear to be simpler than mammals and yet they are susceptible
to tumors just like mammals. Therefore, some of the lessons that we
learn  about  plant  tumors  may  be  helpful  in  the  analysis  of  animal
tumors. One feature that makes the study of plant cells and plant tumors
valuable  in  research  on  oncogenesis  is  that  cell  cultures  from  some
plants can be maintained indefinitely in cell culture, but when desired,
these undifferentiated  cells can be  induced to  differentiate back  into
normal plants that reproduce sexually. Such techniques permit detailed
analysis  of  the  causes  of  oncogenesis.  In  addition,  these  approaches
have the potential for yielding valuable  mutants by  using techniques
similar to those used with bacteria for the isolation of single mutant
cells from large cultures and then regenerating complete mutant plants.
The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens can induce the growth of
masses  of  undifferentiated  cells,  called  crown  galls,  in  susceptible
plants.  This  transformation  to  the  undifferentiated  state  requires  a
200-Kb plasmid carried by the bacterium. In the transformation process
at least 8 to 10 Kb of DNA from the plasmid are transferred from the
bacterium  into  the  plant  cells.  There  the  DNA  is  integrated  into  the
chromosome of the plant, where it is replicated along with the cellular
DNA. As a result, all cells of a crown gall contain fragments of DNA
originating  from  the  plasmid.  Part  of  the  integrated  plasmid  DNA
directs the plant to synthesize and secrete the compounds octopine or
nopaline (Fig. 23.1). In turn, these compounds can be catabolized by
the Agrobacter bacteria in the crown gall. Few other bacteria or parasites
can  utilize  these  compounds  for  growth.  Thus,  one  Agrobacterium

subverts  part  of  the  plant  to  produce  nutrients  for  a  large  bacterial
colony.

In contrast to the nontransformed plant cells, the cells from crown
galls  do not require the growth  factors  auxin and cytokinin for their
continued growth in culture (Fig. 23.2). Ordinarily, medium for plant
cells requires the presence of these two small-molecule growth factors
in addition to a variety of other metabolites. With the ratio of auxin and
cytokinin at one value, plant cells in culture remain undifferentiated,
but if the ratio of auxin to cytokinin is increased, stems and leaves tend
to develop. Conversely, if the auxin to cytokinin ratio is decreased, the
cells become root-like. Without either auxin or cytokinin present, the
cells do not grow. In the whole plant, auxin is synthesized in the stem
tips and cytokinin in the root tips. A concentration gradient in these
molecules from the top to bottom of the plant helps cells identify their
positions and develop appropriately. Plant cells transformed with Agro-
bacter do not require either auxin or cytokinin for growth. It is likely
that the DNA that was acquired from the plasmid by the transformed
cells directs or induces synthesis of auxin and cytokinin-like substances
that substitute for these chemicals both in the crown gall and in cell
culture. By analogy to the crown galls in plants, it was predicted and
found that many types of animal cancers would involve alterations in
the cell’s synthesis of, or their response to,  growth factors.

The DNA transfer mechanism utilized by Agrobacter can be utilized
for genetic engineering. The DNA to be introduced to the plant cell can
be included between the DNA recombination sequences of the transfor-
mation  plasmid  and  transformation  then  occurs  much  like  lambda
phage integration.

Transformation and Oncogenesis by Damaging the Chromosome

Epidemiologists  have  long  recognized  that  certain  chemicals  induce
cancer, and Ames has shown that many bacterial mutagens are human
carcinogens. The mutagenicity of chemicals, as detected by the rever-
sion of a set of bacterial histidine mutants, correlates well with their
carcinogenicity. Therefore chromosome damage in the form of muta-
tions or small insertions and deletions is one cause of cancer. The next
section explains how the exact base change responsible for induction of
one particular cancer was determined.

In addition to small lesions, chromosomal rearrangements can alter
either the expression or the structure of RNAs or proteins. Such chro-
mosomal rearrangements are frequently observed in a class of cancers
called  Burkitt’s  lymphomas  in  humans  and  plasmacytomas  in  mice.
These are cancers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells, and therefore it is
likely  that  the  chromosome  rearrangements  in  Burkitt’s  lymphomas
actually involve the immunoglobulin genes. Indeed, the chromosomes
involved in the rearrangements usually are those that contain the heavy
and  light  immunoglobulin  genes  (Fig.  23.3).  The  actual  site  of  the
chromosomal translocation in a Burkitt’s lymphoma can be identified
by cloning the heavy chain constant region from lymphoma and non-
lymphoma cells. Many lymphomas contain a translocation that fuses
part of chromosome 8 to a heavy chain switch region on chromosome
14 (Fig. 23.4). The junction of the translocation sometimes contains a
sequence resembling the DNA it replaced, implying that a recombina-
tion event, or an immunoglobulin switch-related event, was responsible
for the translocation. The DNA that has been translocated to the immu-

noglobulin region codes for one of the cell’s growth regulators known
as c-myc. As a result of the translocation, its expression is deregulated
and its gene is often slightly rearranged. Similar gene translocations of
c-myc are also involved with mouse plasmacytomas. 

Identifying a Nucleotide Change Causing Cancer

As mentioned above, since mutagens are carcinogenic, it is likely that
some  cancers  are  caused  by  mutation.  How  could  we  determine  the
nucleotide  change  or  changes  that  cause  a  human  cell  to  be  trans-
formed? If such a change could be detected, it would definitively identify
the  altered  gene.  This  would  assist  the  study  of  the  gene  product’s
normal  cellular  function.  In  principle,  comparing  the  nucleotide  se-
quences of all the chromosomes from a normal cell and a transformed
cell  would  reveal  the  change.  Even  if  such  an  ill-advised  attempt  to
sequence  about  6  ×  109  base  pairs  of  DNA  could  be  accomplished,
however, the important change would likely be masked by a multitude
of extraneous random nucleotide changes.

To reduce the problem of locating the nucleotide change that causes
a cancer to manageable proportions, a powerful selection technique for
the critical DNA fragment is required. The best selection is to use the
ability  of  the  DNA  to  induce  uncontrolled  growth.  Cells  growing  in
culture can be used for such a screening. For example, one line of mouse
cells, NIH 3T3 cells, has been adapted for continuous growth in culture,
in contrast to primary cell lines that grow for only a limited number of
generations. Nonetheless, the NIH 3T3 cells still display density-depend-
ent growth regulation and cease further growth when a monolayer of
cells has grown on the container surface. Thus, the cells can be consid-
ered to be part way along the pathway leading to transformation. If one
of  these cells is transformed  to  a  cancerous state,  it  loses its  growth
regulation, and its descendants continue growing when the other cells
in the monolayer have stopped. The resulting pile of cells is detectable
through a microscope, and is called a focus. Weinberg and others have

found that DNA extracted from 10% to 20% of different human tumors
can transform NIH 3T3 cells to form foci.

Although the focus assay for transforming DNA fragments could be
used in conjunction with a straightforward biochemical purification of
the  desired  DNA  fragments,  genetic  engineering  methods  permitted
more rapid isolation of the DNA. The basic trick was to tag restriction
fragments  of  the  DNA  extracted  from  a  tumor  before  it  was used  to
transform cells to grow foci. DNA extracted from cells of a focus was
then cloned in E. coli and the colonies or plaques were screened using
the tag sequence as a probe. Of course, the tag had to be a sequence not
normally found in the NIH 3T3 cells or in Escherichia coli (Fig. 23.5).
Therefore, the clone containing the human-derived sequence capable of
transforming the cells to density-independent growth could be detected.
Two methods can be  used for  tagging  the  oncogene  isolated  from
cancerous cells. One  makes  use of  naturally occurring sequences. As
mentioned in Chapter 19, in humans, a particular sequence called the
Alu sequence is widely scattered throughout the genome and is repeated
hundreds of thousands of times. Because this sequence contains two
Alu restriction enzyme cleavage sites, cleavage of human DNA with Alu
restriction  enzyme  generates  hundreds  of  thousands  of  copies  of  a
specific size of DNA fragment in addition to all the other random sized
fragments. The mouse genome lacks this sequence. Simply because of
its  high  repetition  number  and  wide  dispersal  through  the  human
genome, one of the Alu sequences was likely to lie near the mutated gene
responsible for the uncontrolled cell growth and transformation of cells
to form a focus. Indeed, one did, and Weinberg was able to use this as
a tag of the human gene that was mutated to cause the human cancer.
A second method for tagging the oncogene is direct and general. DNA
isolated from a tumor can be digested with a restriction enzyme, and a
synthetic DNA containing the desired tagging sequence can be ligated
to it. Then the mixture of DNAs can be transformed into cultured mouse

cells  for  selection  of  the  fragment  containing  the  oncogene.  This  is
followed by cloning in bacteria and identification of the oncogene clone
with the use of the tag sequence as a probe.

A minor technical point must be mentioned. The cultured cells that
take up the human DNA usually take up many molecules. Therefore,
although a focus of cells will contain the desired transforming gene, it
is likely to contain a number of other irrelevant human sequences as
well.  These  also  will  contain  the  tagging  sequence.  This  problem  is
eliminated by using DNA extracted from the primary round of transfor-
mation in a second round of transformation. Indeed, after the first cycle,
a Southern transfer prepared from DNA of a transformed cell reveals
many sizes of restriction fragments containing the human-derived  Alu
tagging sequence (Fig. 23.6), but after a second cycle of transformation,
all the transformants contain only a single copy of the tagging sequence.
Presumably this is directly linked to the stretch of DNA that is respon-
sible for the transformation.

The techniques described above permitted the cloning and isolation
of DNA fragments 5 to 10 Kb long that contained the cellular oncogene
from bladder carcinoma cells that could transform NIH 3T3 cells. Once
these fragments were obtained, they could be used as probes in screen-
ing  genomic  libraries  made  from  DNA  isolated  from  noncancerous
human cells. Thus the normal gene predecessor of the oncogene could
also  be  obtained.  Then  the  question  was  merely  to  determine  the
difference between the two DNAs. Again, they could have been totally
sequenced, but ingenuity reduced the work. Restriction fragments be-
tween the two were exchanged to find a small DNA segment that was
necessary for transformation (Fig. 23.7).

A  single  nucleotide  difference  was  found  to  separate  the  normal
cellular prototype and its oncogenic variant. The most common change
in the bladder cancers was found to occur in the twelfth amino acid of

650  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

a  protein.  Since  both  Northern  transfers  of  total  cellular  RNA  and
immune precipitations of the actual gene product involved show that
neither transcription of the gene nor its translation efficiency is appre-
ciably altered by the mutation, the structural change in the protein must
be the cause of its oncogenicity, and this has been observed. The gene
encodes a protein called Ras that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. The mutant
protein possesses reduced hydrolytic activity.

Retroviruses and Cancer

Just as bacteria can induce a type of cancer in plants, bacteria or viruses
could  cause  cancer  in  animals.  One  method  to  determine  whether
viruses can do so in animals is to try to induce cancer in animals using
a cell-free or bacteria-free extract prepared from tumor cells. One of the
first such isolations of a tumor-inducing material was made by Peyton
Rous from a cancer of connective tissue—a sarcoma—isolated from a
chicken. Hence the virus is called Rous sarcoma virus, or RSV. Repeated
propagation  of  the  virus  in  the  laboratory  extended  its  range  from
chickens to many different animals and increased its potency. RSV is a
member of a class of RNA viruses that cause sarcomas in birds, mice,
cats, monkeys, and other animals. These viruses are called avian, mur-
ine, feline, and simian sarcoma viruses. Similar techniques have been
used to detect cancers of various types of blood cells from nonhumans,
and  the  causative  viruses  are  called  leukemia  viruses.  Detection  of
similar  viruses  that  cause  tumors  or  leukemias  in  humans  has  been
much more difficult and only a few are known.

The sarcoma and leukemia viruses are both retroviruses. That is, the
nucleic acid within the virus particle is single-stranded RNA, and yet
this RNA can be duplicated to double-stranded DNA and integrated into
the  genome  of  some  infected  cells  (Fig.  23.8).  The  enzyme  reverse
transcriptase that performs the replication is packaged within the virus
particle along with a virally encoded protease and the integrase.

Initiating  the  viral  replication,  much  like  replication  from  DNA
templates,  requires  a  free  hydroxyl  group  in  the  proper  location  for
polymerase to use as an initiator. A tRNA molecule of cellular origin

hybridized to the virus RNA and packaged within the virus provides the
necessary priming hydroxyl. The conversion to double-stranded DNA
slightly rearranges and duplicates the ends of the genome to generate
the long terminal repeats, LTRs, that are found at each end of the RNA
(Fig. 23.9). These are synthesized from the unique U5 and U3 regions
that are originally found at each end of the RNA, and the R region that
is found at both ends. This replication and synthesis process most likely
makes  use  of  the  two  genetically  identical  RNA  molecules  that  are
encapsidated within the virion and can involve jumping of the reverse
transcriptase from one template to the other or from one point on the
template  to  another  point.  After  its  duplication,  the  linear  double-
stranded  DNA  migrates  to  the  nucleus  where  the  phage-encoded  IN
protein, which comes from part of the pol gene, integrates at least one
copy into the chromosome. If such an integration occurs in a germ line
cell, the retroviruses can pass vertically from one generation to the next.
If non-germ line cells are infected, the virus is said to spread horizon-
tally.

Three  essential  viral genes are  found  in  nondefective  retroviruses:
gag, pol, and env. In Rous sarcoma virus, these three genes encode: 1.
four structural proteins found within the virus and a protease; 2. the
reverse transcriptase, its associated RNAse H, an enzyme that degrades
RNA from the RNA-DNA duplex intermediates, and the integrase; 3. two
virus envelope glycoproteins. The virus uses two methods to synthesize
this large group of different proteins from just three “genes” and one
major promoter.

Recall that eukaryotes rarely use polycistronic messengers. Gener-
ally, multiple translation initiations are not used to synthesize different
proteins from a single messenger. Retroviruses follow this general rule,
but in doing so, they use several different mechanisms to generate at

652  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

least ten different proteins from three open reading frames on one RNA
molecule. From the gag gene one polypeptide is synthesized. This is cut

76,000 MW gag polypeptide

into  five  different  polypeptides.  The  pol  gene  following  the  gag  gene
usually is out of frame with gag, and sometimes slightly overlapping.
Ribosomes translating gag occasionally shift their reading frame into
that of the pol gene and synthesize a combined gag-pol polypeptide. This
frameshifting  requires  an  RNA  hairpin  or  pseudoknot  shortly  down-
stream from the frameshift point. As a result of the RNA structure and
suitable codons at the frameshift site, the frequency of frameshifting
approaches 5%. From the long Gag-pol polypeptide, proteases excise
segments  that  constitute  the  internal  proteins  and  the  protease.  The
protease is encoded by RNA occupying the position between gag and
pol, or sometimes by RNA constituting the first part of the pol gene.

A more elaborate scheme is used for translation of the env genes. The
retrovirus mRNA is spliced so that the env gene occupies the 5’ end of
messenger, sometimes using the the initial portion of the gag coding
region, so that it can be translated. The gag product also is cleaved and
yields two polypeptides.

It  is  the  integrated  or  proviral  form  of  the  retroviral  DNA  that  is
transcribed to yield capped and polyadenylated mRNA that is ultimately
translated into viral proteins. The R region of the virus is defined as the
transcription start point of this RNA. The promoter for this RNA must
therefore lie in the U3 regions that exist at both ends of the integrated
virus. Although the right-hand promoter usually is inactive, in the cases
where it is active it is in position to transcribe adjacent cellular DNA.
Therefore  a  retrovirus  can  act like  a  portable  promoter. Usually this
causes  no  problems,  but  sometimes  the  adventitious  transcription  is
harmful.

Acutely  transforming  retroviruses  are  capable  of  inducing  tumor
formation within several days of injection into animals. These carry a
gene in addition to the three discussed above. This additional gene is
called  an  oncogene.  Such  acutely  transforming  viruses  usually  are
defective, however, and lack functional pol or env genes. Therefore they
must be grown in association with their nondefective relatives. This is
analogous  to complementation  by lambda of a defective transducing
phage. RSV is an exception to the general case, as this virus is nonde-

fective  and  carries  an  oncogene,  called  src.  Translation  of  the  src
transcript is accomplished after its mRNA is spliced in a reaction that
places  the  AUG  codon  for  this  protein  near  the  5’  end  of  the  RNA
molecule.

Retroviruses lacking oncogenes are also capable of inducing tumors
in susceptible animals, but more slowly than the acutely transforming
retroviruses. These slow retroviruses often take several months to gen-
erate tumors. Apparently, out of a great number of virus-infected cells,
a small number, often only one, contain a retrovirus inserted adjacent
to a cellular gene involved with growth regulation. The nearby location
of  the  retrovirus  increases  expression  of  the  gene,  either  from
readthrough of a viral transcript or from increased expression from the
cellular promoter as a result of an enhancer sequence within the LTR
of the virus. The virus may also promote rearrangement of the gene so
that variant protein is synthesized.

Cellular Counterparts of Retroviral Oncogenes

Are the viral oncogenes of acutely transforming viruses related to any
cellular genes? This is a good question for a number of reasons. Since
chromosomal rearrangements point to specific genes as being involved
in transformation to the cancerous state, genes related to these may be
carried  on  the  retroviruses.  Also,  since  cancer  can  be  induced  by
mutagens, it would seem likely that the mutations responsible  could
alter  cellular  genes  to  resemble  their  analogs  carried  on  the  acutely
transforming  retroviruses.  Finally,  a  slow  retrovirus  occasionally  be-
comes  acutely transforming  by the substitution  of part of its genetic
material by host material. Most likely the new gene originates from the
chromosome of the cells in which the virus has been growing.

The question as to whether the viral oncogenes are related to cellular
genes  can  easily  be  answered  by  Southern  transfers.  Undue  fears  of
dangers from cloning such DNAs have long passed, and viral oncogenes
may now be handled, at least in the United States, without unnecessarily
elaborate  precautions.  The  viral  oncogenes  from  a  number  of
retroviruses  have  been  cloned  from  the  virus  into  plasmid  or  phage
vectors. Then the appropriate restriction fragments have been used to
probe Southern transfers of DNA extracted from noncancerous animals.
Most surprisingly, chickens, mice, and humans all possess a sequence
of DNA with high homology to the src gene. Clearly this gene has not
evolved  rapidly  in  the  time  since  these  animals  diverged  from  one
another. This implies that the cellular function of this protein is funda-
mental and closely tied to  other cellular  functions so  that its further
evolution is frozen.

The viral form of the src gene is called v-src and the cellular form is
c-src. Homology measurements similar to those carried out for Rous
sarcoma  virus  have  been  done  for  other  acutely  transforming
retroviruses (Table 23.1). Most of the viral oncogenes in these viruses
possess  cellular  counterparts  as  well.  About  50  different  viral  and
cellular forms of the oncogenes are known. This means that a reasonably

small number of genes are involved in regulating cell growth and that
there is some hope of being able to deduce how the products of these
genes function in normal and transformed cells.

The mutated gene that Weinberg found in the human bladder carci-
noma cells is carried in a slightly modified form on a rat-derived Harvey
murine sarcoma virus. It is called H-ras. The myc gene which translo-
cates  into  the  heavy  chain  locus  of  the  immunoglobulin  genes  in
Burkitt’s lymphoma, has also been identified on a retrovirus. Thus the
same proto-oncogene can be activated through various cellular or viral
mechanisms.

Identification of the src and sis Gene Products

Eukaryotic cells contain thousands of proteins. Most likely, only a few
of these are involved in regulation of growth, and these probably are
synthesized in small quantities. Therefore it would seem like a difficult
task  to  identify  a  protein  as  the  product  of  either  c-src  or  v-src  and
virtually  impossible  to  determine  the  enzymatic  activity  of  such  a
protein. Nonetheless, Erikson accomplished both for the v-src protein.
The  starting  point  of  this  work  was  the  fact  that  animals  with
sarcomas or lymphomas frequently synthesize antibodies against the
retroviral proteins. The v-src protein might also induce antibody syn-
thesis in animals if it were sufficiently different in structure from all
other cellular proteins. Therefore rabbits were infected with an avian
sarcoma virus that could induce sarcomas even in some other types of
animals.  The  same  virus  was  also  used  to  transform  chick  embryo
fibroblasts in vitro. These chicken cells ought to synthesize the same
viral proteins as the rabbit. As a result, these proteins would be recog-
nized  by  the  rabbit  antibodies.  In  addition,  the  chicken  embryo  fi-
broblasts ought to contain very few of the other proteins that would be

Identification of the src and sis Gene Products  655

recognized by the rabbit antibodies. Therefore, the v-src product ought
to be one of the very few proteins recognized by the antibodies.

Extracts  from  radioactively  labeled  RSV-transformed  chick  cells
were incubated with the serum from the RSV-infected rabbits. Since the
quantities of proteins bound by the antibodies were low, an antigen-an-
tibody lattice was unlikely to form. Another method had to be used for
selectively isolating the antigen bound to antibody. Erikson used whole
cells of Staphylococcus aureus because as mentioned earlier, one of its
surface proteins, protein A, specifically binds to IgG. After incubation
of rabbit serum with the radioactive chick proteins, the Staphylococcus
cells  were  added  and  the  mixture  centrifuged  to  separate  antibody-
bound radioactive proteins from those not bound to antibody.

About 20 radioactive proteins from the chick cells were precipitated
by the rabbit serum. Among them was one that was present only if the
labeled proteins originated from transformed chick cells. Furthermore,
this  protein  was  not  present  if  the  cells  had  been  infected  with  a
nonacutely  transforming  retrovirus.  In  addition,  the  protein  was  the
same  molecular  weight  as  a  protein  synthesized  in  vitro  using  the
oncogene portion of RSV as a messenger. In this way, the v-src gene
product was identified as a 60,000 molecular weight protein, which is
called p6Osrc.

An enzymatic activity associated with src was discovered on the basis
of  an  educated  guess.  Since  the  protein  probably  is  involved  with
regulating growth and since phosphorylation of proteins is involved in
regulating many activities in eukaryotic cells, the src protein could be a
protein  kinase.  Therefore  radioactive  ATP  and  potential  kinase  sub-
strate proteins were included with the Staphylococcus-precipitated IgG-
bound src protein. Indeed, a kinase activity was detected. It was shown
to be the product of the src gene because it was absent from cells grown
at high temperature that had been transformed with mutants of RSV
that  do  not  transform  at  high  temperature.  While  most  amino  acid-
linked phosphate in cells is phosphothreonine or phosphoserine, less
than 0.03% is phosphotyrosine. Following RSV infection, the levels of
phosphotyrosine dramatically increase. These elevated levels fall if the
infecting virus possess a temperature-sensitive kinase and the tempera-

656  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

ture  of  the  cell  culture  is  raised.  Together,  these  pieces  of  evidence
provide solid proof that the kinase is the product of v-src.

Another related question is whether the antibodies against the v-src
gene  product  could  detect  the  c-src  gene  product.  They  could,  even
though the protein is synthesized at a small fraction of the level at which
the viral homolog is synthesized. The cellular protein also is a kinase.
Similar studies have permitted partial purification of a number of other
viral and cellular oncogene products. In many cases the cellular loca-
tions  of  these  proteins  can  also  be  determined  by  fractionation  of
cellular components or with labeled antibodies.

The  actual  cellular  function  of  the  oncogene  carried  on  a  simian
retrovirus, v-sis, has also been identified. This was not done via antibod-
ies and enzyme assays. Instead, the nucleotide sequence of its oncogene
identified its product as the platelet-derived growth factor.  This had
been  purified  for  entirely  different  reasons  from  blood  plasma.  It  is
released by platelets at the sites of wounds and stimulates growth of
fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and glial cells. When the amino acid
sequence  for  the  growth  factor  was  entered  into  a  data  base  and
homologies were sought, the simian virus oncogene immediately was
revealed  as  encoding  a  close  relative.  Almost  certainly the  retrovirus
gene derives from the growth factor gene.

DNA Tumor Viruses 

DNA  viruses  are  less  closely  associated  with  cancer  than  are  the
retroviruses  because  their  infection  does  not  usually  yield  tumors.
Except for papillomaviruses, which cause warts, DNA viruses cannot
readily be found in natural tumors. Papovaviruses, including SV4O, and
the  very  closely  related  polyoma  virus,  as  well  as  adenoviruses  and
herpes viruses, do have the capability of transforming cells in culture so
that they lose their density-dependent growth regulation. These trans-
formed cells can then be injected into animals, where they will cause
tumors.

Transformation  of  mouse  cells  by  SV4O  and  of  hamster  cells  by
polyoma virus involves T proteins that are called T antigens. Normally
three are found. They are called small, middle, and large T, for their
respective sizes. The messenger for these three different proteins origi-
nates from one gene as a result of alternative splicing of the mRNA. The
three  proteins  were  identified  immunologically  in  the  same  way  the
retroviral oncogene proteins were identified. Antibodies against these
proteins are induced in response to the presence of the virus.

The antibodies obtained from animals carrying SV4O- and polyoma-
induced tumors have been used to show that the T antigen genes are
expressed early after infection and that the T antigens bind to proteins
in the nucleus, to DNA, and to other cellular structures. The presence
of one of the T antigens alone is usually insufficient to transform cells,
suggesting  that  in  general  the  process  of  transformation  requires  a
number of steps. This conclusion is in accord with the fact that the NIH

3T3 cell foci-inducing DNAs isolated from tumors are not capable of
transforming primary cell lines.

The activity of the T antigens has been a subject of great interest, but
the low levels at which they are synthesized in vivo has greatly hampered
their study. They were therefore perfect targets for genetic engineering.
Indeed, by properly fusing the DNA encoding the different proteins to
suitable  ribosome-binding  sequences,  these  proteins  have  been  hy-
persynthesized in bacteria, and the proteins can be used for biochemical
studies. They also serve as a marker for expression of a promoter in an
organism. A promoter and its associated regulatory sequences can be
fused to the T antigen gene and inserted into the chromosome of an
animal. Expression of the T antigen gene frequently gives rise to tumors
that are confined to the tissues in which the gene is expressed.

Adenoviruses  and  papillomaviruses  also possess  genes  responsible
for transformation of cells. Like the SV40 virus, their oncogenes possess
no cellular counterparts. Two transcripts are synthesized from the E1a
and E1b genes of adenovirus (Fig. 23.10). Through splicing and protein
processing,  each  gives  rise  to  four  or  five  protein  products.  Some
regulate  other  genes,  and  two  bind  to  cellular  proteins  important  in
transformation. The adenovirus E1a binds to a protein discussed below
called Rb for retinoblastoma. The adenovirus E1b protein binds to a
cellular protein of 53,000 molecular weight called p53. One of the SV40
T antigens also binds to this same protein, as does a protein encoded by
papillomaviruses. Papillomaviruses also encode a protein which binds
to  Rb.  The  fact  that  different  tumor  viruses  synthesize  proteins  that
inactivate  Rb  and  p53  indicates  that  these  two  cellular  proteins  are
important  for normal cell growth. Indeed, the next section  describes
experiments leading to the same conclusion.

658  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

Recessive Oncogenic Mutations, Tumor Suppressors 

Transformation studies like those used to find the DNA change associ-
ated with a bladder cancer have shown that only about 10% of tumors
can be associated with dominant mutations. Similarly, fusion of trans-
formed  tumor  cells  and  normal  cells  shows  that  in  most  cases,  the
genotype of the normal cells can suppress the oncogene being expressed
in the transformed cells. If the fusion cells possess an unstable karyotype
and lose chromosomes, then the descendants of these fused cells can
again express the transformed phenotype. Thus, oncogenesis can derive
from  two  different  pathways.  The  first  is  dominant  mutations  that
generate transformed cells independent of the other cellular genes, and
the second is a product of two events. One of these is a mutation that
would produce uncontrolled cell growth were it not for the presence of
another cellular regulator, and the second is the loss of the regulator. 
The  simplest  example  of  the  two-step  pathway  is  a  mutation  in  a
growth  factor  such  that  it  no  longer  prevents  uncontrolled  growth.
Ordinarily the mutation to inability to repress growth is not revealed
because the mutation is recessive and the nonmutated copy of the gene
product from the other copy of the chromosome suppresses growth. If,
however, the  nonmutated  copy  is  lost by  recombination or mutated,
then the growth inhibition ceases. Retinoblastoma is a form of cancer
that  develops  in  young  children.  Most  cases  of  retinoblastoma  are
familial, and the pattern of inheritance indicates that the gene involved
is not on a sex chromosome. The patterns of retinoblastoma develop-
ment suggest that in addition to inheriting a defective gene, a second
event must occur in the stricken individuals. We now know that this
second event frequently is recombination of the defect from one chro-
mosome onto the homologous chromosome in a way that leaves both
chromosomes defective for the critical gene. Gene conversion as dis-
cussed earlier could do this.

Through good luck and hard work the gene whose defect gives rise

to retinoblastoma was cloned. The first step in the process came from
the  finding  that  an  appreciable  fraction  of  retinoblastoma  cell  lines
possess  a  gross  defect  or  deletion  in  part  of  chromosome  13.  This
suggests that the gene in question lies on chromosome 13. With this as
a starting point it was possible to clone the gene. The original idea was
that perhaps a clone could be found containing some of the DNA that
is deleted from chromosome 13 in some of the retinoblastoma lines. By
chromosome  walking,  it  might  then  be  possible  to  clone the  desired
retinoblastoma gene.

A library of about 1,000 clones of segments of chromosome 13 was
available. These were then screened against a large panel of retinoblas -
toma lines to see if any of the clones contained DNA absent from the
transformed cell lines. One clone indeed contained DNA absent from
two of the retinoblastoma lines. Best of all, it was complementary to an
RNA that is synthesized in normal cells, but not in retinoblastoma cells.
This suggests that the protein could, in fact, be the gene for the suppres-
sor of retinoblastoma.

TrpE-Rb can be made in E. coli and
purified  for  immunization.  Some
of  the  resulting  antibodies  should
have Rb specificity. 

Further study of the retinoblastoma protein required sensitive assays
for its presence. Two approaches were used to make antibodies against
the supposed retinoblastoma suppressor protein. Part of the cloned and
sequenced gene was fused to the trpE gene and a fusion protein was
synthesized in E. coli, purified by making use of the trp tag, and used to
immunize  animals  for  antibody  synthesis  (Fig.  23.11).  The  second
approach was to synthesize chemically peptides corresponding to sev-
eral regions of the presumed protein and use these to immunize ani-
mals.

With antibodies against the protein, the synthesis and properties of
the retinoblastoma protein could be studied. It is indeed synthesized in
normal  cells,  but  frequently  is  missing  in  retinoblastoma  cells.  The
protein is phosphorylated, and has a molecular weight of about 105 kD.
This is the molecular weight of one of the cellular proteins to which the
adenovirus E1a protein, the papillomavirus E7 protein, and the SV40 T
antigen bind. Since the E1a-associated protein is phosphorylated like
the Rb protein, and since phosphorylation of proteins is relatively rare,
it seemed possible that the retinoblastoma suppressor protein and the
E1a-associated protein were one and the same. Indeed, they were. Both
antibody specificity and proteolysis patterns confirm the identity. Thus
it appears that the normal role of the retinoblastoma suppressor gene
is to counteract the positive activity of some other cell growth inducing
pathway.  Hence  one  of  the  steps  in  transformation  by  adenovirus,
papillomavirus,  and  SV40  is  to  inactivate  suppressor  proteins  rather
than to synthesize a dominant growth-inducing gene in the cells.

In as many as 50% of human tumors, the p53 protein is found to have
been altered. Thus, this protein appears to play a key role in regulating
cell growth. What is the nature of the regulation expressed by the p53
protein? Is it required at all times for proper cell growth or regulation
of differentiation? A conceptually simple way to answer these questions
is to attempt to make a homozygous mouse deficient in p53 protein.
Such mice turn out to develop normally, but they are highly likely to
develop cancers before they are as old as six months. The tumors are
found  in  many  different  tissues.  Further  study  has  shown  that  p53
prevents the onset of DNA replication in a cell possessing damaged DNA
or a broken chromosome. By blocking DNA synthesis, and allowing time
for DNA repair, the spontaneous mutation frequency in cells is greatly
reduced.

660  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

The ras-fos-jun Pathway

The  ras  protein  is  one  well-studied  oncogene,  partially  because  it  is
encoded by the oncogene Weinberg found in the transformation assays
of  the  NIH  3T3  cells.  More  extensive  studies  have  shown  that  an
activated  ras  product  is  found  in  10  to  20%  of  all  human  cancers.
Humans possess three different ras products, N-ras, which is encoded
on chromosome 1, H-ras from chromosome 11, and K-ras from chro-
mosome 12. Even Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two ras products.
In order that these ras proteins be able to respond to extracellular
and transmembrane receptors, they are held on the inner surface of the
plasma membrane by farnesyl. This is a fatty acid, membrane-loving,
intermediate of  the  cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The farnesyl is
attached to the carboxy terminal cysteine of ras. The same principle of
attaching a membrane-soluble molecule to a protein is used to attach
the outer membrane of Escherichia coli to the peptidoglycan layer. In
yeast, the same enzymes that transfer the fatty acid to the cysteine of
ras  for  membrane  attachment  also  modify  a  mating-type  factor.  Al-
though ras proteins bind nucleotides and have a GTPase activity and
are therefore G  proteins, they function as monomers, whereas many
other G proteins function as heterotrimers. 

The  G  proteins  are  activated  by  the  binding  of  a  GTP  nucleotide.
When they hydrolyze this to GDP, the activation ceases. Not surpris-
ingly, then, oncogenic ras mutants do not hydrolyze the GTP normally.
Some have mutations in the GTP-binding site, and others have lost the
ability  to  bind  to  an  accessory  protein,  GAP,  for  GTPase  activating
protein (Fig. 23.12). It is the GAP protein that interacts with the growth
factor  receptor.  When  the  receptor  is  occupied,  the  GAP  protein  is
phosphorylated.  It  therefore  ceases  to  stimulate  hydrolysis  of  GTP
bound to ras. This leaves ras in an activated state. As a result, it activates
a  phosphorylation  pathway  that  ultimately  phosphorylates  and  acti-
vates the c-jun protein.

Phosphorylated c-jun then forms a heterodimer with c-fos protein.
This heterodimer is also known as AP-1 and it activates transcription
from a wide collection of promoters.

The fos and jun oncogenes were identified on retroviruses and the
cellular  analogs  were  then  found  using  their  homology  to  the  viral
forms. These proteins are typical leucine zipper transcriptional activa-
tors and they bind to the same DNA sequence as the yeast general amino
acid regulator protein GCN4. The structure of the fos and jun leucine
zippers favors a heterodimer rather than homodimer formation due to
the  presence  of  opposite  charges  on  the  two  helices.  The  theme  of
heterodimer  formation  regulating  cell  growth  is  common  and  both
leucine zipper proteins and helix-loop-helix proteins participate in this
form of regulation.

Directions for Future Research in Molecular Biology

It is clear that knowledge of the eukaryotic cell is far from our under-
standing of lambda phage or E. coli, but our understanding of even these
simpler objects is far from complete. Therefore we can perceive three
general areas for future research in genetics and molecular biology. In
the  first,  simpler  systems  in  bacteria,  yeast,  and  the  fruit  fly  will  be
studied in greater depth so that we may understand as much as possible
about the physics, chemistry, and biochemistry common to all systems.
An ultimate goal of this direction of work is the ability to predict the
properties of a protein given its structure and to modify known proteins
so that they will fold fold and bind to any desired sequence on a nucleic
acid  to  regulate  a  cell  activity  in  any  way  we  desire,  or  possess  any
reasonable structural or enzymatic property. In  the more immediate
future, we should learn how to modify known proteins, RNA molecules,
or DNA molecules to carry out functions different from, but related to
their natural ones.

A second general area of work will be understanding cellular proc-
esses.  This  includes  study  of  the  following:  the  mechanisms  used  in
nature for regulating gene and enzyme activity; the complicated inter-
actions  between  metabolic  pathways;  and  the  mechanisms  of  many
functions such as movement, active transport, RNA splicing, cell divi-
sion, and receptor function. A third area of future work will be that of
understanding organisms as a whole. This will include how cells and
tissues develop and differentiate and how they signal to one another and
then respond.

Problems

23.1. Recalling that either of the X chromosomes in each cell of a
woman is inactivated, how would you determine whether a carcinoma
derived from transformation of a single cell in contrast to transforma-
tion of multiple cells?

662  Oncogenesis, Molecular Aspects

23.2. Rous sarcoma virus contains two identical single-stranded RNA
molecules,  each of  which  contains all the genetic information of  the
virus. Devise an experiment to test the conjecture that recombination
between the two genomes, not necessarily in their RNA form, frequently
generates an intact genome from two damaged ones.

23.3. What control experiments are necessary to ensure reliability in
the series of experiments in which serum from an animal with a sarcoma
was used to precipitate proteins from cultured transformed cells and
thereby identify the src gene product?

23.4. In the experiments examining the kinase activity of v-src, what
experiments would you do next if you observed that protein phospho-
rylation was nearly instantaneous and that the rate was independent of
the volume of the reaction?

23.5. In experiments to determine which portion of the mutated gene
conferred  tumorgenicity,  restriction  fragments  were  exchanged  be-
tween the oncogenic and non-oncogenic forms. This sort of experiment
is fraught with danger, however, for false positives could arise as a result
of incomplete restriction enzyme digestion, minor DNA contamination,
and so on. What controls can be put into this experiment to warn of
such pitfalls?

23.6. Why is injection of a retrovirus or DNA virus into a newborn or
young  animal  more  likely  to  generate  a  tumor  than  injection  into  a
mature animal?

23.7. Suppose you had a collection of tumors whose DNA was capable
of  transforming  cells  in  culture.  What  is  the  most  efficient  way  to
determine, not with absolute certainty but with a high degree of confi-
dence, whether the oncogenes involved are identical?

23.8. Remarkably, monoclonal antibody against the oncogene prod-
uct responsible for the EJ bladder carcinoma was available for compar-
ing the translation efficiency of the cellular prototype and the oncogenic
version. By searching through the literature, find how this antibody was
obtained.

23.9.  In  transforming  susceptible  cells  in  a  search  for  the  DNA
sequences  involved,  one  might  worry that  several  disconnected  DNA
segments may be required. How could this possibility be excluded by
varying the transformation conditions?

23.10. Exposure to UV light can induce cancers that can ultimately
be traced to retroviruses. Propose a hypothesis to explain this finding
and an experiment to test your idea.

23.11. Describe the steps that would be required to generate a ho-

mozygous p53 deficient mouse.

23.12. Why is it more sensible for ras proteins to use the hydrolysis
of GTP to GDP rather than dissociation of GTP from the protein as the
signal to end their activation?

Hints and Solutions to
Odd-Numbered Problems

Chapter 1

1.1. The periplasmic space must possess an osomotic pressure nearly equal to that
found within the cell on the other side of the inner membrane. As this osmotic
balancer must  not  escape through  pores in the  outer membrane, it  must be
large. It must also be flexible so that its constituents each contribute substan-
tially to the osmotic pressure.

1.3. Solve en = 107en⁄0.95 for n.
1.5. Cells grow as eµt, and total protein increases as P0eµt. Therefore, beginning at
 = 0.01µP0eµt. Integrating
t = 0, the rate of the enzyme’s synthesis is 
between 0 and t gives E(t) = 0.01P0(eµt − 1), and dividing this by total protein to
obtain the fraction which is the enzyme yields 0.01P0(1 − e−µt).

1.7. First, express everything in moles or grams. We will use moles. 10-13 gm ≈
10-15 moles, 10-15/30 min = 3 × 10-17 moles/min. 10-3 molar in 10-12 cm3 (10-15
liter) is 10-18 moles. 3 × 10-17 moles/min ×  t = 10-18 moles, t = 0.3 min or about
20 sec.

1.9. If each protein molecule were located on a corner point of a cubic lattice with
a distance of x cm between the centers of adjacent molecules, there would be
1⁄x molecules along a 1 cm distance, and therefore (1⁄x)3 molecules per cm3. One
molecule has a mass of 30,000/Avagadro’s number ≈ 5 × 10-20 gm. Therefore, to
make a concentration of 0.2 gm/cm3, set (1⁄x)3 × 5 × 10-20 = 0.2. Solving for x
yields x3 = 2.5 × 10−19, or x ≈ 6 × 10−7, giving x = 60 Å.

1.11. Place cells or vesicles in a high concentration of KCl for a long time so that
the ion concentration inside equilibrates with the outside. Rapidly dilute into
low salt buffer and add valinomycin. The potassium will exit the vesicles, leaving
them temporarily negatively charged.

1.13. Because the time scale of interest in this problem is short in comparison to
the doubling time of the cells, we can take the flow rates and pool size to be

667

668  Hints and Solutions

constant over the time of the problem. Let the internal pool size be P moles and
the flow rate of amino acids from the pool into protein be F moles/min. When
the radioactive amino acids are added, the pool does not change in size. Let C(t)
be the total radioactive counts in the pool at time t, and A cts/min be the specific
activity  of  the  externally  added  radioactive  amino  acid.  Clearly
C(0) = 0  and C(∞) = AP. Flow of cts into the pool in a time interval dt at time t

small t behavior, expand the exponential in powers of t. The first nonvanishing
term is  F2At2⁄P, and thus radioactivity in protein first increases as t2. For later
times, the exponential decays away, and cts in protein = FA(t −

the two ways of drawing the situation are equivalent.

2.3. 3 × 109 base pairs × 3.4 Å per base pair.
2.5. Consider a two-stranded rope. If a stick is inserted between the strands and
pulled forward, it tends to overwind the rope in front and underwind the rope
behind the original insertion point.

2.7. A nick in the DNA could act as a flexible point, and would have an effect similar
to a bend at the same position. If nicked near the middle of the DNA length, the
DNA would migrate more slowly, hence the DNA extracted from the trailing
part of the band, when run on a denaturing gel, contains nicks in the central
region of either strand. DNA extracted from the leading part of the band tends
to be nicked near either end of either strand.

2.9. Consider a circular DNA molecule containing -200 superhelical turns. These
knot up the DNA, and have some difficulty in forming. With respect to super -
coiling, the molecule resists having these turns and tries to have, say -190. To
keep the linking number constant, a shift from -200 superhelical turns to -190
means a decrease in the linking number, L = T + W, 4800 = 5000 + (-200) and a
shift to -190 superhelical turns means 4800 = 4990 + (-190). The greater the
failure  to  assume  the  desired  number  of  superhelical  turns,  the  greater  the
unwinding.
2.11. a and d.
2.13. Building the structure without twists means L = W. Pulling the ends taut
removes  all  writhe  from  the  structure  and  since  L  remains  invariant  in  the
operation, L = T afterwards. Thus W before = T after.

2.15. 12.
2.17. Two bands, +1 and -1, run identically. To separate the three, perform the
electrophoresis in the presence of a low concentration of ethidium bromide or
preferably,  some  weaker  binding  intercalating  agent.  Intercalation  reduces
twist, and hence adds to writhe. In ethidium bromide the three might go to +10,
+11, and +12 superhelical turns, which would separate from one another.

2.19.  Electron microscopy if  the  molecules  are large, sedimentation where the
catenated  molecules  will sediment  more  rapidly  than the decatenated  mole-
cules, or electrophoresis in which catenated molecules will migrate more slowly
than decatenated molecules. If we are assaying the decatenation of two inter-

locked rings to two independent rings, we would see a change in the electro-
phoresis rate of the product, and neither of the molecules before or after the
decatenation reaction would be sensitive to exonuclease.

3.1 The numbers of molecules per cell will surely fluctuate. The relative sizes of
the  fluctuations  will  be  smaller  the  larger  the  total  number  of  molecules

tion origin.

4.1. If the combined molecular weight of β and β’ is 3 × 105, one molecule weighs
5 × 10-19 gm. If total cellular protein is 10-13 gm, the amount of β and β’ is 5 ×
10-16 gm. Thus the cells contain 10-16/10-19 = 1000 molecules.

4.3. The bases could be contacted by polymerase in the closed complex or in some
other state between the closed and open complex, or the bases could be required
to generate a necessary structure in the DNA.

4.5. Untwisting the DNA by moving a bubble forward without rotation tends to
overwind the DNA in front. Overwinding is equivalent to positive supercoils.
The positive supercoils thus introduced neutralize the negative supercoils and
thus reduce the amount of negative supercoiling.

4.7. A penny is about 1 cm2. Assume each electron deriving from a decay travels
straight through the film and activates at least one silver halide to be reduced
to silver upon development. If multiple crystals are formed, assume they will
be in a line with the first. This area of blackness will be the cross-sectional area
of the crystals in the emulsion. Depending on the film, these are about 10-3 cm
across, for an area of 10-6 cm2. For a very crude guess ignoring statistics, one
might estimate about 106 decays would be necessary. In reality, a significant
number of the areas of blackness from the decays will overlap. An OD of 1 means
0.1 of the light penetrates or 0.1 of the area has not been hit by an electron.
Therefore, consider an area of 10-6 cm2. If the overall OD is to be 1.0, then the
probability that our small area has not been hit has to be 0.1. From the Poisson
distribution (see a calculus or statistics book) if the average number of hits is
m, the probability that a site will not be hit is  e−m. Thus 0.1 = e−m and m = 2.3,
giving a total of 2.3 × 106 decays.

4.9. If there were only one functional target on the initiation complex, doubling
the number of enhancer proteins could do no more than double the response.
The greater than linear response means that there is more than one target for
the enchancer proteins so that if one contacts the complex, the other can also
bond  and  stabilize  the  complex.  In  turn  this  requires  that  the  event  of  the
formation of the enhancer-initiator complex stimulate more than one round of
transcription, that is, that enhancer complexes can be stable entities and that
once formed, they can activate transcription repeatedly.

4.11. Three sites are involved here, two RNA polymerase binding sites, 1 and 2,
and  the  A  protein  binding  site.  Polymerase  bound  to  1  blocks  polymerase
binding to 2. Bound A protein blocks polymerase binding to site 1, but not 2. If
Site  1  binds polymerase rapidly but only very slowly dissociates or initiates,
then adding polymerase before A gives a slowly increasing rate of initiations,
but adding A before polymerase blocks the inhibitory site 1, and upon polym -
erase addition, it binds to site 2 and initiations almost immediately begin at the
full rate.

4.13. If the repressor binding site is downstream from the promoter, then almost
surely the usual situation will have a polymerase stuck behind the repressor.
When the repressor dissociates, then at least one polymerase will be released
to transcribe the operon. Alternatively, if the repressor binds in the promoter,
only  after  the  repressor  has  dissociated  is  the  promoter  accessible  for  the
binding of a polymerase. Many repressor dissociation events will be followed
by  the  rebinding  of  the  repressor  or  binding  of  another  repressor  molecule
without the binding of a single polymerase molecule. Hence the repressed level
in this case will be lower.

5.1 Assuming the hybridization and digestion steps were complete, the two bands

5.5. If the cap site were created by splicing, then the β phosphate could not be

radioactive in the final product.

5.7. Such introns will incorporate radioactive guanosine in vitro into the RNA.
Incubate RNA extracted from the cells in buffer with radioactive guanosine, run
a gel and look for radioactive bands.

5.9. The internal acceptor nucleotide forms the bond before cleavage. Consider a
nuclease that cleaves the 3’-5’ phosphodiester bond. Likely this will be inhibited
by  the  presence of  a  2’-5’ bond.  Thus  the  nucleotide  in  question will yield a
higher molecular weight and more highly charged product than normal. Fur-
ther,  standard  RNA  sequencing  with  digestion  and  characterization  of  the
products will reveal the anomalous nucleotide. Finally, such a branched site
would block reverse transcription past this point. 

5.11. There is only one place left where the molecules could store the energy in a
phosphodiester bond, another phosphodiester bond. The only such bond pos-
sibility  subject  to  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  problem  is  a  2’-3’  cyclic
phosphodiester bond.

6.1. Donors: R, D, Q, K, S, T, Y, W, H. Acceptors: S, T, Y, D, Q, M, H, D, E.
6.3. If they denature from  a structural change  and not  a chemical  change like
oxidation, then the active form was not the lowest energy form, but merely one
that formed first and later disappears as the protein slowly acquires the more
stable but inactive conformation.

6.5. The amino group is tied up in the proline ring and is not free to form the

normal H bonds required in an alpha helix.

6.7. Nothing, as the change to D form changes the stereochemistry of the side
group which is not involved in the basic hydrogen bonding pattern of an alpha
helix.

6.9.  30,000  MW  is  approximately  5  ×  10-20  gm  per  molecule,  or  a  volume  of
approximately 4 × 10-20 cm3. If a cube, its edges are roughly 35 Å. From the
structure of an alpha helix, the H bond parallel to the axis is in a group of three
bonds, and since most chemical bonds are about 2 Å, the rise per helical turn
on an alpha helix is about 6 Å. Thus it takes  35⁄6 = 6 turns to go from one edge
of the protein to the other. This is 6 × 3.6 = 22 amino acids, and 300/22 = 14.
Therefore about 14 direction reversals could be expected.

6.11. Consider the helical wheel representation. The leucines and the valines on
one  helix  all  line  up  behind  one  another.  Since  both  valine  and  leucine  are
hydrophobic, both must be involved in
the hydrophobic  interactions that di-
merize the molecule. If the monomers
are antiparallel, the leucine-leucine in-
teractions should be equivalent to the
valine-valine interactions.  This is im-

possible, but if the monomers are parallel, the valine-leucine interactions must
be equivalent to leucine-valine interactions, which is easily satisfied.

6.13. Reflections or inversions convert L-amino acids to D-amino acids, but all

amino acids in normal proteins are L-form only.

6.15. Having a smaller side chain, glycine introduces more degrees of freedom

that the various binding interactions must overcome.

6.17. (a) Ala, Leu, Met (b) Pro, Gly (c) KAALAMAMMMLLK.
7.1. As the mass of tRNA per cell is somewhat less than of rRNA, there are about
20  tRNA  molecules  per  ribosome.  At  a  protein  elongation  rate  of  20  amino
acids/sec, it would take about one second to deplete all the charged tRNA if most
of the tRNA in a cell were charged, which it is.

7.3. The finding, which does not contradict the Shine-Dalgarno hypothesis, means
that  the fmet-tRNA  was  blocked from binding not because  the  trinucleotide
homologous  to  its  AUG  was  covered,  but  because  some  other  part  of  the
fmet-tRNA encountered a steric clash.

7.5. Gly-Ala, Ser-Thr, Phe-Try.
7.7. The trp codon is UGG, the anticodon is CCA. If the CCA anticodon is mutated

to CUG to suppress UAG, it will fail to read trp codons and the cell will die. 

7.9. Lys, Gln, Glu, Leu, Ser, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Gly Phe are possible. Lys, Gln, Leu, Ser,
Tyr, Trp, and Gly have been found. Most likely the tRNA required is a single
species and the former amino acid can no longer be properly decoded.

7.11. If this were the case, we would expect in the electron microscope to observe

many of the ribosomes in a polysome to be clustered at the polymerase.

7.13. If you must synthesize twice the ribosomes in half the time, their synthesis

rate must be increased by four. Symbolically,
R(t) = R(0)eµt,  and 
dr

 is proportional to µ2.

7.15.  The  synthesis  of  some  of  the  proteins  that  help  protein  folding  or  the
refolding  of  denatured  proteins  could  be  induced  by  the  presence  of  excess
denatured protein. Methanol would denature some proteins and could there-
fore induce proteins in the heat shock class.

7.17.  Ribosomal  proteins  regulate  their  own  synthesis.  Oversynthesis  of  one
protein would likely turn down the synthesis of others in the same operon or
which are regulated by the same protein. If these were not also oversynthesized,
the cell would be deficient in these proteins and could not synthesize ribosomes
to the proper level.

8.1. Mitotic recombination would shuffle copies of genes from one chromosome
to  another,  but  generally  would  not  accomplish  anything  useful  in  diploid
organisms. If genes could be inactivated by such recombination, then mosaic
tissues could be formed, and these probably would not be beneficial.

8.3. After mutagenesis, select Lac constitutives at high temperature with phenyl-
galactose,  and  from  these  select  Lac  uninduced  by  growing  on  glycerol  and
orthonitrophenyl-thiogalactoside.

8.5.  Suppose  the  original  cross  is  aA ×  aA,  to  yield  aa,  aA,  Aa,  and  AA.  If  A  is
dominant, aA, Aa, and AA cannot be distinguished. If each of these is crossed
with aA, then aA and Aa yield some aa progeny whereas AA yields only aA or AA
progeny and none with the phenotype of a.

8.7.  Suppose  the  methylation  were  in  the  promoter  of  a  gene  whose  product
methylates that particular promoter sequence, and as a result of the methyla-
tion, expression of the gene is turned on. Alternatively, suppose that if the base
is methylated, a cellular enzyme methylates the complementary strand of this

Hints and Solutions  673

particular sequence, and similarly, if the complementary strand becomes meth-
ylated, the enzyme methylates its complementary strand.

8.9. If the markers were on different chromosomes, an offspring receiving one of
the markers would have a 50% chance of receiving the other. If the markers
were on the same chromosome, the chances could be higher than 50% if the
markers were not too widely separated. If they were widely separated, the best
approach  would  be to  map  each  to  a  chromosome by  using markers  whose
chromosome location is known.

8.11.  With  contiguous  assayable  gene  material  between  the  two  markers,  if
imprecise recombination occurs, on selecting for A+ C+ recombinants, B- should
be generated. 

8.13. Consider markers A, B, C, D at the corners of a square. The genetic distances

A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A =1, and A-C as well as B-D = 1.414.

8.15. 5-E-1-(D, B)-(3, 4)-(A, F)-6-C-2. Like most real data, there was an inconsis -
tency. Most likely the cross between deletion E and point mutant 6 should have
given recombinants.

8.17. Runs of consecutive A’s or T’s, since misincorporation of another base that
matched  the  base  beyond  the  homopolymer  run  might  facilitate  slipping  or
small loop formation rather than repair.

8.19. The streptomycin-sensitive ribosomes would synthesize toxic peptides and

kill the cells despite the presence of streptomycin-resistant ribosomes.

8.21. When transducing a recessive marker in which the dominant allele is lethal,
as are both streptomycin resistance and rifamycin resistance, growth must be
permitted so as to allow the dominant and lethal cell component to be replaced
by the recessive and nonlethal one. That is, growth must be permitted so that
the streptomycin-sensitive ribosomes have been diluted away by the streptomy-
cin-resistant ones in those cells that receive the Smr allele.

8.23. A brief treatment with nitrosoguanidine mutagenizes just the region of the
chromosome replicated during the treatment. Treat with nitrosoguanidine and
select Leu+ cells, which will be enriched for mutations in the vicinity.

8.25.  Temperature  mutations  were  sought.  Therefore  mutagenized  cells  were
shifted to high temperature, exposed to tritiated leucine for 30 min, washed,
and put in the freezer for two months. The survivors were greatly enriched for
temperature-sensitive protein synthesis mutations.

8.27.  Both  will  be  mutagenic,  either  from  not  permitting  time  for  the  newly
replicated strand to be repaired, and thus either strand would be repaired, or
in letting a mispaired base exist until the next replication fork passes.

8.29. UV damaged DNA must be repaired by an error-prone system that is induced
by the presence of a significant amount of damaged DNA or by a UV-induced
change to some other component in the cell.

8.31. The sex specificity could well reside at a step beyond adsorption, for example
at the initiation of protein synthesis or DNA synthesis. Nonetheless, the problem
asks for the reasoning if adsorption is the source. In this case the data means
that cells synthesize two different surface components, one specific for each
state of the cells. When one is synthesized, the other is not synthesized.

8.33. Because XX Drosophila exist, no essential genes can be located only on the

Y chromosome.

8.35.  Repeatedly  subject  a  stock  of  appropriately  mutagenized  flies  in  a  long
cylinder to light from one end and take the flies from the unilluminated end for
the next cycle of enrichment. 

8.37. The average number of cells per tube is three, and by the Poisson distribution
(see a calculus or statistics book) the probability P that a tube receives n cells
mn
n! e−m. For m = 3 and n = 0, P = 0.05. Since cells in more

Chapter 9

Chapter 10

of  the  tubes  than  this  failed  to  grow,  either  not  all  the  cells  are  capable  of
growing, or a tube must receive more than one cell to grow. The probability of
receiving one cell is 0.15, so the  probability of receiving two or more cells is
0.80. Since this is close to the observed value of 0.75, it seems most likely that
cells can grow in a tube only if the tube receives two or more cells.

8.39. One expects a temperature-sensitive mutation to result from some compo-
nent,  usually  a  protein,  being  nonfunctional  only  at  high  temperature.  A
deletion  fails  to  produce  a  component  at  all  temperatures.  The  explanation
could  be as follows.  A protein could be required for the transmission of the
impulses, but become much less effective at higher temperatures. If one copy
of the gene for the protein were deleted, then the critical temperature at which
impulses could no longer be transmitted would  be lowered.

9.1.  The  restriction  and  modification  systems  must  be  a  much  more  recent

evolutionary development than the metabolic pathways.

9.3.  When  the  concentration  of  transforming  DNA  is  low  enough  that  a  small
fraction of the competent cells are being transformed, if the number of trans-
formants is proportional to the DNA concentration, a single DNA molecule is
responsible, but if it is proportional to the square of the DNA concentration,
two molecules are required.

9.5. 0.154, 0.254, 0.354, 0.0005, 0.004, 0.015. Thus, the frequency a site appears

can be strongly dependent on the base composition.

9.7. Fill out the sticky end of the EcoRI-cut DNA with DNA polymerase so it is
flush-ended, and blunt end ligate the two DNAs together so as to regenerate the
EcoRI site.

9.9. Such a position likely would generate a band in all four lanes because the
DNA would cleave at the methylated position. Omitting the chemical modifica-
tion step and performing just the chemical cleavage step could confirm that the
DNA contained a modification at the position in question.

9.11. Infect transformed cells with a phage. Those having acquired a restriction

enzyme will survive better. A number of cycles could be required.

9.13. Yes, it is a way to avoid the need for isolating single-stranded DNA and the

use of a primer.

9.15. Assume the plasmid contains a selectable drug resistance gene and at least
one cleavage site for the restriction enzyme partner of the methylase. Trans-
form, isolate plasmid DNA, cleave it with the restriction enzyme, and transform
again. Cycle if necessary. A plasmid that carries the methylase will modify itself
when in the cells and this DNA will not be cleaved by the restriction enzyme
treatment and hence will transform again.

9.17. Ligate cut E. coli DNA to a selectable DNA fragment lacking an origin and

transform.

10.1. If the injected DNA recombines before DNA replication occurs, then all cells
of the the progeny are identical. If the recombination occurs after one or more
replication  cycles,  mosaics  will  be  generated.  The  pattern  of  mosaicism  can
reveal the developmental pathways of the mouse. The ability to cross defective
genes into the chromosome permits study of their effects.

10.3. Transformation and selection for markers X and Y assure recombination at
A’ and  A’’  and  the  disruption  of  the chromosomal  copy of the  gene plus the
incorporation of the copy carried on the
transducing fragment.

like  conveniently  located  restriction  sites  and  unique  sequences  suitable  for
primer hybridization for PCR amplification.

10.7. PCR amplify from template A using primers 1 and 2 where the nonhybridiz-
ing  portion  of  primer  1  contains  restriction  sites  that  will  be  convenient  in
cloning, and the nonhybridizing part of primer 2 is the initial sequence of the
bottom  strand  of  template  B.  PCR  amplify  from  template  B  using  the  PCR
product  from  the  first  reaction  and  primer  3,  which  also  contains  useful
restriction sites. Note that the PCR amplification from template B uses the top
strand of the product from the first reaction as the left-hand primer.

10.9. The numbers of individuals, and hence, of recombination events is very low;
hence distances cannot be computed directly from the fraction of individuals

11.1.  1-4-6-4-1, 1-40-600-4000-10,000.  The  probabilities can  be found  from the

binomial expansion of (A + B)4 and (A + 10B)4.

11.3.  For  β-galactosidase,  cells  will  be  Lac+  at  low  temperature,  Lac-  at  high
temperature, and β-galactosidase synthesized at low temperature will be func-
tional at high temperature. Perform selections for the first two properties, then
grow at low temperature on lactose and shift to high temperature for two to
three generation times. For repressor, select for Lac repressed at low tempera-
ture, for example by using phenyl-galactose and glycerol in a GalE- strain in
which  the  constitutive  expression  of  β-galactosidase  will  generate  galactose
which will be lethal in the GalE- background. Then grow cells at low tempera-
ture, shift to high temperature for one doubling time, and again select for Lac
repressed cells. 

11.5.  Mate  an  episome  with  a  LacY-  mutation  into  cells  with  another  LacY-
mutation. After mating, grow cells with and without IPTG and then score for
the fraction of Lac+ cells. Need to show the mutations do not affect transcription
beyond the point of the mutation.

11.7. For fully induced cells with the “a” response, in 10-6 M IPTG, Ci is 10-3 M,
and cells remain fully induced. A slight down fluctuation in Ci still leaves cells
100% induced and the transport system concentrating IPTG by 1000-fold. If
their response were “b”, a slight down fluctuation in  Ci reduces the induction,
the transport system no longer concentrates by 1000-fold, and the average value

Chapter 11

676  Hints and Solutions

of Ci  falls, further reducing the induction level. Estimating numbers from the
graphs shows that once the system begins to fall down curve “b”, it eventually
reaches a point of zero induction. Similar reasoning applies to uninduced cells
upon being put in 10-6 M IPTG.

11.9.  0.1  ml  of  10-6 =  10-10 moles  =  10-7  mmoles.  Activity is 50 mCi/mmole so
radioactivity is 10-7 mmoles × 50 mCi/mmoles = 5 × 10-6 mCi. Total dpm = 1.2
× 109 dpm/mCi × 5 × 10-6 mCi = 6000 dpm from the outside sample. For the
inside sample we first need the repressor concentration. One molecule per cell
volume of 10-12 cm3 is 10-9 M, therefore inside the cell repressor concentration
was 10-7 M, but the cytoplasm was diluted from 100-200 mg/ml to 50 mg/ml of
the  extract,  so  Rt  =  5  ×  10-8.  Dpm  inside  =  6000  ×  1 + 
  =  6000  ×

 = 60. Ratio of inside to outside was 1.01. At the lower

IPTG concentration it becomes 1.0125. It is not of use to lower IPTG concen-
tration.

11.11.  Cells  should  remain  uninduced  at  IPTG  concentrations  that  normally
induce. Select for nonexpression with tONPG or GalE- as in problem 11.3, and
then select for expression by growing in lactose. Could score for the desired
mutants by first growing in lactose to select those that induce normally and
then  plating  on  X-gal  with  marginally  inducing  concentrations  of  IPTG  and
taking the colonies that are white.

11.13. With little increase  in the amount of DNA required to code for protein,
twice the number of protein-DNA interactions can be generated if a repeat of
the binding site is used. If the site is an inverted repeat, a finite oligomer-like
dimer or tetramer will possess the necessary symmetry in its subunit arrange-
ment. If the site were a direct repeat, the protein would also have to contain a
direct repeat, and could infinitely polymerize.

11.15. If the lacI product were RNA, the mutations that made cells LacI- either
reduced the synthesis of repressor or reduced its stability. The introduction of
nonsense  suppression  to a  cell could increase RNA synthesis  by  altering the
activity or specificity  of  a transcription  factor, or  reducing termination. The
latter, though unlikely, is more likely than the former. Just as protein can be
helped  to  fold  by  specialized  proteins,  suppose  an  analogous  RNA  folding
protein existed. Suppose it had been useful to cells, but was no longer essential
and  was  being  evolved  away.  If  the  cellular  gene  for  an  “RNA-foldase”  had
acquired a nonsense mutation, then the introduction of nonsense suppression
could increase the amount of an RNA. Another possibility is that modification
of repressor stabilizes it, and the modifying protein is nonessential and happens
to possess a nonsense mutation.

11.17. At equilibrium, the rate of formation of repressor-DNA complex equals the
rate of dissociation. If k1 and k−1 are the association and dissociation rates and
KD  is  the  equilibrium  dissociation  constant,  setting  the  rates  equal  we  find
R × D

 = KD.

11.19. One must be careful in in vitro experiments to use components at concen-
trations near their in vivo values. If the mutation reduced the binding constant,
but components were at too high a concentration, the results described would
have been found.

11.21.  The  repressor  has  an  increased  affinity  for  DNA  such  that  it  binds  to
nonspecific DNA and rarely makes its way within a doubling time to operator
to repress. If the system could reach equilibrium, eventually repressor would
partition  itself  between  operator  and  nonspecific  DNA  in  the  ratio  of  its

Chapter 12

Chapter 13

Hints and Solutions  677

affinities for these sequences and their relative numbers. If equilibration is slow
compared to a doubling time, this partitioning will not occur. As IPTG concen-
tration is increased, repressor’s affinity for DNA falls and eventually matches
the wild-type affinity and lac the basal level becomes normal.

12.1. Assume the functional form of AraC is an oligomer with a large number of
subunits, say eight or more, and that the presence of a single-wild type subunit
in an oligomer can force the Cc subunits into a wild-type state.

12.3. Arabinose isomerase is an oligomer, and it is conceivable that in an oligomer
the  presence  of  a  subunit  with  one  mutation  could  be  compensated  by  the
presence of  a  subunit carrying  the other mutation.  The compensation of an
AraC mutation by a CRP mutation suggests that the two proteins contact one
another and the mutations compensate for a bad contact. This is a reasonably
likely inference and certainly not a proof.

12.5. One simple generic mechanism is for AraC-arabinose and CRP to push the
balance toward induction and AraC and the weak promoter to oppose it. If the
promoter  were  altered  to  facilitate  induction  by  tipping  the  balance  toward
induction, then perhaps  removing CRP would tip the balance back. Alterna-
tively, if the AraIc mutation facilitates the same step normally aided by CRP,
removing CRP would have no effect.

12.7. Repressor bound there likely would interfere with repression and therefore
induction would be higher. Addition of IPTG to such a system would have a
repressive effect!

12.9. The key here is to devise a growth medium on which Cc mutations do not
grow,  but  C+  mutations  do.  If  you  had  such  a  medium,  you  could  mate  an
episome  carrying one mutation into female cells carrying another mutation,
and plate on the selective medium as well as nonselective medium to determine
the recombination frequency. Fucose + ribitol + glycerol is a suitable selective
medium;  fucose  further  induces  Cc  mutations,  ribitol  is  phosphorylated  by
ribulokinase and inhibits cell growth, and glycerol provides a carbon source to
the C+ recombinants.

12.11. In possibility a, CRP would be implicated in breaking a repression loop
between araI and araO1 or araO2. In possibility b CRP would appear to act more
directly on AraC and independent of any upstream site.

12.13. Suppose the AraC product were an RNA. There is no reason why tempera-
ture-sensitive RNA mutations cannot exist. Indeed, they are known in tRNAs.
12.15. Nitrosoguanidine mutagenizes DNA at the replication fork. When growing
in rich medium, multiple replication forks are present on a chromosome, and
they are spaced such that one is crossing the rif region at the same time the
other is crossing the ara region. Hence the double mutations are not particularly
rare.

12.17. AraC directly contacts RNA polymerase in the induction process, but does

not contact CRP.

13.1. Hybridize an oligo that would bind to region 1 of the newly synthesized RNA

so the 2-3 hairpin could form and attenuation would be blocked.

13.3. Secondary structure could cover the ribosome binding site. A region beyond
the site could cover the site once this downstream region has been synthesized
and the site is accessible.

13.5. Fuse a TrpR-regulated promoter to the β-galactosidase gene. If a multicopy
plasmid carrying a trp operator enters the cells, repressor will be titrated and
trp promoters will be derepressed. On x-gal such a cell would form a blue colony.
13.7. We need to change the repression and attenuation mechanisms and assure
the availability of chorismate. Eliminate the trp operator. If the leucine operon
possesses a repressor, place its operator so as to repress transcription. Replace

678  Hints and Solutions

the trp leader and attenuation region with the analogous region from the leu
operon. Introduce a DAHP synthetase that is not feedback-inhibited by phenyl-
alanine or tyrosine or tryptophan.

13.9. Perhaps the multiple alternative hairpins are unnecessary. Suppose just the
analog of the trp 3-4 termination hairpin might form. Suppose also this region
of the leader RNA is translatable and the corresponding RNA is rich in purines.
If the cell were low in purines, the polymerase elongation rate would be reduced,
and  the  ribosome  translating  the  leader  RNA  would  keep  right  up  with  the
polymerase.  This  would  prevent  formation  of  the  termination  hairpin.  If
purines  were  at  high  concentration,  polymerase  could  outrun  the  ribosome
translating the leader RNA, could form the termination hairpin, and terminate
before entering the structural genes.

13.11.  The  termination  hairpin  might jam  in  the  polymerase thereby blocking
elongation  and  eventually  the  RNA  dissociates.  Base  and  sequence-specific
interactions  are  made  between  bases  in  the  region  and  RNA  polymerase.
Formation of the G-C hairpin forces the RNA through a channel in polymerase
that pulls the RNA off the DNA template.

13.13. Place the hypersynthesizing deletion on a plasmid or episome and assay
the behavior of the wild-type chromosomal operon, for example by assaying
TrpE, D, or C synthesis, since the deletion lacks genes for these proteins.

Chapter 14

13.15. You would see equal amounts of RNA upstream and downstream from the
attenuation  site  and  you  would  conclude  that  if  attenuation  occurred,  it  re-
quired some component missing from the in vitro reaction mixture.

14.1. Cross λ and 434 and plate on a λ lysogen. Grow up a plaque, cross against λ

and again plate on a λ lysogen. Repeatedly cycle this procedure.

14.3.  The  footprinting data  is  incompatible  with the  cloverleaf model.  See the

footprinting paper.

14.5. Although the A and R genes are adjacent in circular or concatenated DNA,
the adjacent copies do not end within the same phage particle. The effective
distance between the A and R genes is the entire length of the phage genome.
Note this is true only of sites flanking the ter or cos cleavage site. 

14.7. Make a lysogen of λv1v3P- . Infect with a λimm434O-. If O protein is present
as a result of nonrepression of v1v3, complementation will occur. Do analogous
experiments using N protein for testing v2.

14.9. The existence of the membrane potential keeps S protein from allowing R
protein to reach the peptidoglycan layer. Blocking protein synthesis also allows
S protein to function. Perhaps continuous cellular protein synthesis is necessary
to keep S from working.

14.11. After the heat treatment the lysogen is expressing cro, and upon infection
the  presence  of  Cro  protein  directs  all  the  incoming  phage  down  the  lytic
pathway.

14.13. There is a striking tendency for the DNA target site of proteins to be located
close  to  the  gene  encoding  the  protein.  Evolutionarily  this  makes  sense  as
recombining one or the other only into a different phage would be of no value.
14.15. Destruction of N protein likely would be dominant whereas alteration of
the cellular target of N would be recessive. Therefore make cells diploid for the
nus allele and test.

14.17. The outer membrane of the cell provides protection. The larger the holes,

the more types of molecules have access to the inner membrane of the cell.

14.23. The basic mechanism of action is likely to be the same, differing only in
the structures that read sequence. It is unlikely that ten different antitermina-
tion mechanisms could exist.

14.25.  Although  it  would  appear  that  the  effective  concentration  of  repressor
would be increased, the auto-regulation system would take care of this aspect.
Instead,  the  consequences  would  be  reduced  cooperativity  in  the  overall  re-
sponse system. Thus the spontaneous induction rate would be increased, and/or
the effectiveness of inducing would be decreased.

15.1. Try using cell and nuclear extracts from yeast and human cells as a source
of most of the transcription apparatus and eggs as a source of specific transcrip-
tion factors that would stimulate the synthesis of the 5S RNA. Less satisfactory
would  have  been to  take eggs that  did  stimulate transcription and  purify  or
isolate one component after another that would permit synthesis. This would
be similar to the approach Kornberg took to isolating proteins involved in DNA
synthesis before the use of mutants streamlined the process.

15.3. The time scales of development are relatively long compared to the times
required  for  proteins  to  find  and  bind  to  specific  sites  on  DNA.  Therefore
equilibrium binding constants generally will be more relevant.

15.5. Thoroughly remove DNA with enzymes and then remove the enzymes. Then
make copies of the 5’ end of the desired RNA molecules by hybridizing a primer
to the RNA and using reverse transcriptase. Further amplify these with PCR.
15.7. The problem is finding the proteins and genes involved in turning off one
gene and turning on another. Make β-galactosidase fusions to the promoters
and  then  isolate  mutants  that  no  longer  shut  off  oocyte  RNA  or  which  still
synthesize somatic RNA. Map genetically to see if they were in known or likely
regulatory factors or protein binding sites, purify the relevant proteins using in
vitro complementation between extracts, and then biochemically look at the
roles of the involved components.

spores  produced  by  a  diploid  heterozygous  for  a  SIR  mutation  were  fertile
immediately  upon  sporulation,  then  the wild-type  allele would be  dominant
since it generated repressor that could work in the spore with the mutant gene
before it was diluted away.

16.5. Mix extracts used in the in vitro cutting assay.
16.7. An HO strain is likely to express the enzyme 106-fold higher than an ho strain.
Such cells could constantly be shifting their mating type and therefore there
would be much mating between a and α cells, which would shut off synthesis
of the enzyme. To prevent the mating type switch, you would need mutations
in HML and MAT or HMR and MAT.

16.9. Plate cells on a semi-starvation plate so colonies grow, then form spores if
they are diploid. HO mutants would mate with their own progeny and become
diploid so they could form spores. Haploids would not form spores. The spores
from HO colonies will mate with both mating type testers while ho colonies will
mate only with one type of tester.

16.11. The question is whether the mutant MATa cells do not respond to α mating
factor or whether mutant MATα  cells do not synthesize α factor. This can be
tested  by  micromanipulation:  place  the  mutant  MATa  cells  near  normal  α
mating type cells and observe whether they elongate towards the MATα cells.

16.13. Results mean that 94% of the time a mating type cells accept information
from HML, independent of what it contains, and 94% of the time α mating type
cells take information from HMR, independent of what it contains.

17.1. Mutagenize males (XY) to generate X’Y and keep each separate. Mate with
females (XX), take any female offspring, which could be X’X and mate with its
male progenitor. Test the female offspring of this mating for fertility of the eggs.
17.3. The time required should be on the order of the time required for the protein
to diffuse the length of the egg. Taking the egg to be 0.1 cm long and using the
material from Chap. 1, the time is about 4000 sec, or 1 hr.

17.5. Preservation of protein sequence but not DNA sequence.
17.7. You couldn’t map the mutations genetically.
18.1. The probability of a molecule segregating into a specific daughter is 1⁄2. For

18.3. Show that the restriction fragment spanning the λ insertion site disappears
when λ  integrates  and  that  the  new  fragments  are generated  that  consist of
bacterial and phage DNA and that these are of the expected sizes.

18.5. λb2 cannot easily integrate, but λ can. A  simple way for λb2  to  integrate
would be to recombine with λ to form a double-sized circle. When this inte-
grates, a double lysogen of λ and λb2 is formed.

18.7. Use two PCR reactions. In one, use a primer from the beginning of the gene
and a primer from one end of the phage and in another PCR reaction, change
to a primer from the other end of the phage and the other strand.

18.9. Thermodynamics says that the reverse of any reaction must also proceed. It
does not say the rates must be the same. The relative rates will be determined
by the equilibrium constant of the reaction. The excision reaction is too slow
in the absence of Xis to be biologically useful and thus an entirely new reaction
pathway is opened by the presence of Xis.

18.11. A single excision event of the type described integrates the episome into
the  chromosome.  This  is  rarely  observed  because  when  lambda  is  induced,
multiple excision events can occur, so that if the integration event did occur, it
would soon be followed by further excision events and lysis of the cell. Of course,
the sites are not near one another in the cell due to folding of the chromosome,
so  the event would  be rare.  One  might  wonder about  heat  pulse  curing and
integration of the episome, and there currently is no good explanation for the
low frequency of this type of event.

18.13. Measure the supercoiling sensitivity of the binding of Int and Xis. If it is
not simple binding, the supercoiling might be required to bring distant sites
into  proximity.  This  might  be  shown  if  the  supercoiling  requirement  were
overcome by putting attL and attR on small circular DNA.

18.15. λimm21 must not induce its int gene well since phage 21 has a different CII
protein from lambda. Therefore λimm21 is unlikely to make enough Int protein
from its own genome or from the lysogen’s genome to give facile excision.

18.17. P1 transduce the cells to Gal+ λ lysogenic with P1 grown on a Gal+ λ lysogen.

This is possible since P1 will carry DNA fragments twice the size of λ DNA.

18.19. In one orientation the region between the att sites is removed to form a
smaller  circle,  and  in  the  other  the  direction  of  the  segment  is  inverted.  Of
course  the excision  is  useful for assaying  integration or excision.  When  it is
performed with supercoiled DNA, the products are catenated.This is useful for
checking  whether  a  reaction  can  proceed  in trans.  The  inversion reaction  is
useful for separating two sequences, as in turning a promoter on or off.

18.21. The substrate can act as a suicide substrate inhibitor because the reaction
can proceed to the point where it needs to reform the phosphodiester bond. It

Chapter 19

Hints and Solutions  681

cannot reform the bond because the initial phosphotransfer reaction could not
occur.

19.1.  Show  that  a  particular  drug  resistance  carried  on  an  R  factor  can  be
transferred at high frequency to an episome. For example, mate the episome
into a population of cells carrying the R factor and then mate again into a third
strain and show that the frequency of transfer is much higher than the 10-6 or
lower that might be expected for illegitimate recombination.

19.3. The old fashioned way was utilizing the fact that the strands do not possess
equal  amounts  of  purines  and  pyrimidines.  Denature  the  DNA,  mix  with
poly(dG), which anneals to many regions on one strand and not so many on the
other, and separate DNA by density by equilibrium density centrifugation. The
more  modern  method  is  to  denature  the  DNA,  quick  chill  and  run  on  an
acrylamide gel. For reasons unclear, the strands either do not form identical
secondary structures or do, but do not migrate with equal velocities, and the
two strands  separate.   The  most modern  method  to  obtain  one or the other
strand would be to place the desired region of the lambda in a plasmid that
contains  an  origin  for  a  single-stranded  phage.  Phage  infection  of  the  cells
containing  the  plasmid  would  yield  the  desired  DNA.  A  short  segment  of
single-stranded lambda could also be made by asymmetrical PCR in which one
primer is limiting and the other is present in five to tenfold excess.

19.5. Repeated and highly repeated sequences will have rehybridized. Therefore
the rRNA genes and IS sequences will be present in double-stranded DNA. That
is, there should be half a dozen bands of size from 1,000 to 5,000 base pairs.

19.7. Soon it may be possible merely to read off the sequence to see where anything
is located. Currently the best approach is to screen the clones of a physically
mapped set using a fragment of the IS as a probe. Once the clones have been
identified,  the  position  of  the  IS  within  the  clones  can  be  determined  with
Southern transfer or restriction enzyme cleavage site mapping.

19.9. Cut the Mu DNA with a restriction enzyme that has a cleavage site near the
end  of  the  molecule.  Run  the  cut  Mu  DNA  on  an  acrylamide  gel  and  do  a
Southern transfer using as a probe this end fragment of DNA.

19.11. Mu replicatively transposes itself into new positions. We would therefore
expect a similar replicative transposition into the chromosome upon infection,
but instead, a direct transposition occurs by another mechanism.

19.13. As there seems to be no step of restriction that Mu could block, it is more
likely that the phage would make its DNA look modified. Therefore it is likely
to methylate its DNA extensively in the course of induction and replication. This
could be checked directly by looking for a drastic increase in the methylated
bases of DNA from such cells, or indirectly by assaying the restriction enzyme
susceptibility of DNA extracted from Mu-infected cells.

19.15. The time scales would be those of an intestinal infection, the time of an
immune response, and possibly the time for synthesis of an entire flagellum. It
is, therefore, somewhere between once per week and once per hour.

19.17. The transposable elements serve as portable sites of homology. The recom-
bination events between such elements are equivalent to integration and exci-
sion  events  between  lambda  att  sites  as  covered  in  the  previous  chapter.
Depending on the orientation of the elements, excision or inversion occurs, and
if between different chromosomes, fusion or translocation.

19.19. The transposon moves from a position where it will take an entire doubling
time until it is replicated again to a position elsewhere on the chromosome. On
average  the  wait  for  replication  from  this  new  position  will  be  about  half  a
doubling time.

20.1.  Precipitation  requires  formation  of  aggregates  or  lattices  in  which  one
antibody molecule cross joins two different antigen molecules. Being monova-
lent, Fab cannot crossjoin.

20.3. 300 × 10 × 300 × 10 × 10, or about 108. Not all combinations are compatible
with  one  another,  and  some  of  the  combinations  duplicate  one  another  in
specificity.

20.5. If these residues were changed by somatic mutation, the resultant antibody

was nonfunctional or even toxic to the cell.

20.7. Pick the clone with the highest melting temperature when complexed with

segments of the cDNA probe not including spliced sites.

20.9. Somatic mutations are a fine-tuning to an antibody. Once an antibody has
been generated that is capable of binding the antigen and clonal expansion has
begun, then it is sensible to begin fine-tuning. Therefore the first antibodies,
IgM, have not been refined.

20.11. As the chromosomal rearrangements to create an antibody gene take place,
is the intervening DNA inverted or deleted? Which it is depends on the orienta-
tions. If deletions do occur, then are any genes of interest or importance deleted
from a rearranging chromosome?

20.13. This region of the embryonic DNA is likely to be separated from the coding
region for the main portion of the C region by an intron. Since only a fraction
of  the  antibody  is  membrane-bound,  we  can  expect  alternative  splicing  to
generate two forms of the coding DNA. We could use any cDNA clone to identify
a  clone  of  embryonic  DNA,  then  search  this  DNA  for  the  additional  coding
region.  Knowing  the  anchor  sequence  of  the  protein  would  permit  building
oligonucleotide probes, or we could look for  cDNA clones that contained the
anchor  region  and  then  use  this  to  find  the  corresponding  region  in  the
embryonic DNA.

20.15. Isolate the RNAs used in the PCR amplifications from animals injected with

molecules related to those to which you seek the antibodies.

20.17. As long as the DNA doesn’t saturate the cell’s ability to generate recombi-
nants, the more of the vector DNA that can be isolated from the cells, the easier
it is to perform the experiment.

21.1. (a) Isolate drug-resistant mutants. They might be mapped, and could lie in
known ribosomal genes. More sensible and less work would be to prepare in
vitro  protein  synthesis  reactions  using  ribosome  free  extracts  mixed  with
isolated ribosomes. Mixing between components prepared from sensitive and
resistant cells will reveal  the  drug-resistant component. (b) Same as (a), but
separate  subunits.  (c)  Reconstitute  the  ribosome  from  isolated  RNA,  and
protein from sensitive and resistant cells. (d) The change would have to be a
modification or the absence of a modification, for example a methylation. Most
likely the effect would be the absence of a methylation.

21.3. On the chromosome have a Sm r allele and an episome with the Sms allele.
It would be good to have these cells RecA-. Isolate Smr mutants and mate the
episomes into Su+ and Su- Smr females. The desired episome will yield Sms cells
in Su+ background and Smr in Su- background.

21.5. 10 µgm/ml of a 20,000 MW protein is 3 × 1014 molecules/cm3. The volume
of a ribosome is roughly 10-17 cm3, and the volume of a sphere of twice the
radius is roughly 10-16 cm3. Thus the probability of a single protein being in the
volume is 3 × 1014 × 10-16 = 3 × 10-2, and the probability for 21 proteins is (3 ×
10-2)21 = 10-32.

21.7. Crosslinking might work, or see which proteins lose accessibility to antibod-
ies against individual ribosomal proteins when the other subunit is added, or
see which ribosomal protein antibodies prevent subunit association.

21.9. Adjacent proteins likely have specific interactions. It makes sense for such

proteins to move together upon recombination with other cells.

21.11. Six steps separate two fivefold vertices. T = 36 and the number of triangular

faces is S/3 = 720.

21.13. With a radioactive amino acid label for about 15 minutes cells infected with
A- phage. Remove the label and infect these same cells with A+ E- phage. Isolate
intact  phage  from  the  cells  and  examine  the  radioactivity  in  the  candidate
protein. If it is radioactive, it is not a product of the A gene.

21.15. A lambda with ter or cos duplicated at both ends that has circularized from

the sticky ends.

21.17. Infect cells deleted of attλ with lambda and plate on groE cells. Plaques will

be from groE transducing phage.

21.19. Infect cells with V- phage that are FII

21.21. The number of subunits will be proportional to the surface area which is
proportional to the square of the distance between fivefold vertices denoted by
A and B in the drawing. The lattice numbers are m and n. Since the side opposite
the  30  degree  angle  in  a  30,  60,  90  degree  right  triangle  is  one  half  the
hypotenuse, the side opposite B is m/2. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, the

third side of this triangle, BC, is √3m2

20,000 gm of protein is 6 × 1023

for candidates that can chemotact toward other substances. (b) Same as (a),
but  use  two  temperatures.  (c)  Pick  candidates  from  mini-swarm  plates  that
don’t chemotact or only weakly chemotact. Test these in the capillary assay with

22.5. Approximately 20 cell lengths per second, or 2 × 10-3 cm/sec.
22.7. There are three lenses in the optical path of standard microscopes. Since
each inverts the image, the result is an inverted image and the screw threads
are reversed.

22.9. Find an antibody that binds to the end of the flagellum and see if it prevents
growth. Another approach might be to label cells for 30 sec with very radioactive
amino acids, and then do autoradiography to see which end is labeled. There
exist mutant curly flagellins. Shear off the cells’ flagella, let synthesis proceed
for  half  the  time  required  to  regenerate  the  flagella,  turn  off  the  wild-type
flagellin gene and turn on the curly gene and observe which end of the flagella
is curly.

22.11. No covalent bonds are made or broken. Hydrogen bonds likely are, and

their existence could be shown with tritium exchange from water.

22.13. Decrease in repellent equals increase in attractant and lengthens average

run length.

22.15.  If  the  liganded  receptor  sent  signals  on  to  the  tumble  generator,  then
flooding the system with high concentrations of fucose would tend to blind the
cells to all attractants, not just galactose.

22.17.  This  is  the  expected  result  for  the  methyl  transferase  mutants.  In
methylesterase mutants, the proteins would be methylated soon after synthesis,
and  since  they  are  not  ever  removed,  the  Tar  and  Tsr  proteins  would  be
saturated  with  methyl  groups  and  could  not  be  further  methylated  by  the
standard protocol. 

22.19. The first response compares the most previous second of attractant con -
centration to the concentration a second before that. While this will generate a
chemotactic response, it would be better for the cell to average over a period of
time closer  to  the time interval  over which  it swims  in  one direction  before
random rotation throws it off course. The second response shows this better
behavior. Note that in the first two, the area of the positive lobe equals that of
the  negative  lobe.  This  is  necessary  in  order  that  no  signal  be  generated  by
constant attractant concentrations. The third response shows such a nonphysi-
ological behavior.

23.1. The same X chromosome will be active in all cells of the carcinoma. 
23.3. Check that the protein in question is not precipitated from nontransformed

cells. 

23.5.  First,  perform  the  same  steps  without  the  addition  of  the  homologous
fragments from the other piece of DNA. No transformants should be obtained.
Next, once a fragment that appears responsible for transformation has been
identified,  clone  it  in  a  bacterial  plasmid,  cut  it  out  and  ligate  it  into  the
remainder of the gene to make the gene transform cells.

23.7. The spectrum of sensitivity to restriction enzymes ought to be similar.
23.9. Vary the DNA concentration in the transformation. If more than one gene
is involved, the variation in the number of transformants as a function of the
DNA concentration should be quadratic or higher.

23.11. Infect fertilized eggs with DNA fragments containing a defective p53 gene.
Screen the resulting mice with Southern transfers to find those that carry the
defective gene. Screen their progeny to find those that have the defect in the
germ line. Mate a pair of such mice to find homozygous p53 defective progeny.
