the first boy that kissed me
held my shoulders down
like the handlebars of
the first bicycle
he ever rode
i was five
he had the smell of
starvation on his lips
which he picked up from
his father feasting on his mother at 4 a.m.
he was the first boy
to teach me my body was
for giving to those that wanted
that i should feel anything
less than whole
and my god
did i feel as empty
as his mother at 4:25 a.m.

the therapist places
the doll in front of you
it is the size of girls
your uncles like touching

he fingered out of you
like a confession
how’re you feeling
you pull the lump
in your throat out
with your teeth
and say fine
numb really

every time you
tell your daughter
you yell at her
out of love
you teach her to confuse
anger with kindness
which seems like a good idea
till she grows up to
trust men who hurt her
cause they look so much
like you
- to fathers with daughters

if one person is lying there not doing anything

you tell me to quiet down cause
my opinions make me less beautiful
but i was not made with a fire in my belly
so i could be put out
i was not made with a lightness on my tongue
so i could be easy to swallow
i was made heavy
half blade and half silk
difficult to forget and not easy
for the mind to follow

your mother
is in the habit of
offering more love
than you can carry
your father is absent
you are a war
the border between two countries
the collateral damage
the paradox that joins the two
but also splits them apart

emptying out of my mother’s belly
was my first act of disappearance
learning to shrink for a family
who likes their daughters invisible
was the second
the art of being empty
is simple
believe them when they say
you are nothing
repeat it to yourself
like a wish
i am nothing
i am nothing
i am nothing
so often
the only reason you know
you’re still alive is from the
heaving of your chest
- the art of being empty

you look just like your mother

               i guess i do carry her tenderness well

    you both have the same eyes

               cause we are both exhausted

    and the hands

               we share the same wilting fingers

    but that rage your mother doesn’t wear that anger

               you’re right
               this rage is the one thing
               i get from my father

when my mother opens her mouth
to have a conversation at dinner
my father shoves the word hush
between her lips and tells her to
never speak with her mouth full
this is how the women in my family
learned to live with their mouths closed

father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you
ask what i’m doing or where i am and when the silence
stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find
questions to keep the conversation going. what i long to
say most is. i understand this world broke you. it has been
so hard on your feet. i don’t blame you for not knowing
how to remain soft with me. sometimes i stay up thinking
of all the places you are hurting which you’ll never care
to mention. i come from the same aching blood. from the
same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on
myself. i am your daughter. i know the small talk is the
only way you know how to tell me you love me. cause it
is the only way i know how to tell you.

you plough into me with two fingers and i am mostly
shocked. it feels like rubber against an open wound.
i do not like it. you begin pushing faster and faster. but i
feel nothing. you search my face for a reaction so i begin
acting like the naked women in the videos you watch when
you think no one’s looking. i imitate their moans. hollow
and hungry. you ask if it feels good and i say yes
so quickly it sounds rehearsed. but the acting.
you do not notice.

when my mother was pregnant
with her second child i was four
i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how
my mother had gotten so big in such little time
my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and
said the closest thing to god on this earth
is a woman’s body it’s where life comes from
and to have a grown man tell me something
so powerful at such a young age
changed me to see the entire universe
rested at my mother’s feet

place them inside his forearm

for making them blink
i break gaze just as
he inches toward me
i step back

we’ve been arguing more than we ought to. about things
    neither of us remember or care about cause that’s how
    we avoid the bigger questions. instead of asking why we
    don’t say i love you to one another as often as we used to.
    we fight about things like: who was supposed to get up
    and turn the lights off first. or who was supposed to pop
    the frozen pizza in the oven after work. taking hits at the
    most vulnerable parts of one another. we’re like fingers on
    thorns honey. we know exactly where it hurts. 
and everything is on the table tonight. like that one time
    you whispered a name i’m pretty sure wasn’t mine in your
    sleep. or last week when you said you were working late.
    so i called work but they said you’d already left a couple
    hours ago. where were you for those couple hours. 
i know. i know. your excuses make all the sense in the
    world. and i get a little carried away for no good reason
    and eventually begin crying. but what else do you expect
    baby. i love you so much. i’m sorry i thought you were
    lying. 
that’s when you hold your head with your hands in
    frustration. half begging me to stop. half tired and sick of
    it. the toxin in our mouths has burnt holes in our cheeks.
    we look less alive than we used to. less color in our faces.
    but don’t kid yourself. no matter how bad it gets we both
    know you still wanna nail me to the ground. 
especially when i’m screaming so loud our fighting wakes
    the neighbors. and they come running to the door to save
    us. baby don’t open it. 
instead. lie me down. lay me open like a map. and with
    your finger trace the places you still want to **** out of
    me. kiss me like i am the center point of gravity and you
    are falling into me like my soul is the focal point of yours.
    and when your mouth is kissing not my mouth
    but other places. my legs will split apart out of habit. and
    that’s when. i pull you in. welcome you. home. 
when the entire street is looking out their windows
    wondering what all the commotion is. and the fire trucks
    come rolling in to save us but they can’t distinguish
    whether these flames began with our anger or our passion.
    i will smile. throw my head back. arch my body like a
    mountain you want to split in half. baby lick me. 
like your mouth has the gift of reading and i’m your
    favorite book. find your favorite page in the soft spot
    between my legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly.
    don’t you dare leave a single word untouched. and i swear
    my ending will be so good. the last few words will come.
    running to your mouth. and when you’re done. take a
    seat. cause it’s my turn to make music with my knees
    pressed to the ground. 
sweet baby. this. is how we pull language out of one
    another with the flick of our tongues. this is how we have
    the conversation. this. is how we make up.

when the entire street is looking out their windows
    wondering what all the commotion is. and the fire trucks
    come rolling in to save us but they can’t distinguish
    whether these flames began with our anger or our passion.
    i will smile. throw my head back. arch my body like a
    mountain you want to split in half. baby lick me. 
like your mouth has the gift of reading and i’m your
    favorite book. find your favorite page in the soft spot
    between my legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly.
    don’t you dare leave a single word untouched. and i swear
    my ending will be so good. the last few words will come.
    running to your mouth. and when you’re done. take a
    seat. cause it’s my turn to make music with my knees
    pressed to the ground. 
sweet baby. this. is how we pull language out of one
    another with the flick of our tongues. this is how we have
    the conversation. this. is how we make up.

when my mother says i deserve better
i snap to your defense out of habit
he still loves me i shout
she looks at me with defeated eyes
the way a parent looks at their child
when they know this is the type of pain
even they can’t fix
and says
it means nothing to me if he loves you
if he can’t do a single wretched thing about it

you said. if it is meant to be. fate will bring us back
together. for a second i wonder if you are really
that naive. if you really believe fate works like
that. as if it lives in the sky staring down at us. as
if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us
like pieces of chess. as if it is not the choices we
make. who taught you that. tell me. who
convinced you. you’ve been given a heart and
a mind that isn’t yours to use. that your actions
do not define what will become of you. i want to
scream and shout it’s us you fool. we’re the only
ones that can bring us back together. but
instead i sit quietly. smiling softly through
quivering lips thinking. isn’t it such a tragic thing.
when you can see it so clearly but the other person
doesn’t.

make love to your body. but she will never
lick, caress, or suck like me. she will be a sad

does will excite you and this will break her. when
she is tired of falling apart for a man that doesn’t
give back what he takes she will recognize me in

how can she love a man who is busy loving
someone he can never get his hands on again.

        have gotten a good look at everything you have to offer.
        when they have taken your skin your hair your secrets with
        them. when they realize how real this is. how much of a

you will stand there naked with half of them still hidden

        it. why they forced you to love them when they had no
