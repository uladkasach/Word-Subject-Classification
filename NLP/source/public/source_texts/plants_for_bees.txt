What Is Old Is New

DR . E DI T H PAT C H WA S T H E OR IGI NA L I NS E C T 
 C ONS E RVAT ION I S T, one of the first critics of indiscriminate 
pesticide use, an author of fantastically interesting children’s books, 
and an early pioneer for women in science. But it was in her role as 
the first female president of the Entomological Society of America, 
at the organization’s annual meeting in 1936, that Edith foreshad-
owed this exact book and everything we do here at the Xerces 
Society in a lecture titled “Without Benefit of Insects.”

In that talk Edith discussed the wholesale destruction of insect 

life that had resulted from the new insecticide products that were 
being brought to market, and commented on how in attempting 
to control pests, we were destroying bees and beneficial insects. 
She challenged the assembled scientists to imagine a very different 
world in the year 2000, when she predicted that the President of the 
United States would issue a proclamation declaring that land areas 
at regular intervals throughout the country would be maintained as 
“Insect Gardens,” directed by government entomologists. These 
would be planted with milkweed and other plants that could sustain 
populations of butterflies and bees. She then predicted that at some 
time in the future, “Entomologists will be as much or more con-
cerned with the conservation and preservation of beneficial insect life 
as they are now with the destruction of injurious insects.”

27. PENSTEMON
S OM E T I M E S CA L L E D B E A R D T ONGU E S, many 

(Penstemon spp.)

penstemon species occur in most parts of North America, and 

nearly all are excellent pollinator plants, with attractive flowers. 
The types of pollinators they attract vary depending on the species; 
some showy red-flowered penstemons attract hummingbirds, and 
others support sphinx moths. The largest are tall enough to plant on 
the edges of hedgerows in the West. Smaller species work well as 
meadow plants, especially among smaller grasses that will not shade 
them out. The average sugar concentration in the nectar of some 
penstemon species has been reported at 37%.

Although the exact year she predicted turned out to be slightly 
early, Edith was ultimately right. In the summer of 2015, after exten-
sive behind-the-scenes talks between the White House, Xerces, 
and other conservation groups, President Barack Obama did indeed 
release a first-of-its-kind memorandum. It called upon all federal 
agencies to do two things:

1.  to develop comprehensive conservation plans that would 

protect and restore habitat for bees and butterflies at federal 
facilities and on federal lands

2.  to offer financial incentives for the restoration of pollinator 

habitat on private lands, especially farmlands

The President also issued a challenge to the conservation com-
munity to help foster a million new pollinator gardens in residential 
yards and business campuses across the country — an effort Xerces 
is supporting through our Bring Back the Pollinators Garden 
Campaign (www.bringbackthepollinators.org).

While the accuracy of Edith’s prediction is both haunting 
and heartening, amazingly she was not alone in pioneering the 
call to create habitat for pollinators. Twenty years earlier, in fact, 
Iowa polymath Frank Chapman Pellett established near his child-
hood home what may have been the first large-scale bee garden in 
the United States. Although formally trained as a lawyer, Frank 
eschewed the basic trappings of prosperity, choosing instead to live 
in Gandhi-like Midwestern simplicity in a small, plain farmhouse. 
There he researched tomato gardening, devoted countless hours 
to bird watching, and meticulously documented and cultivated the 
 preferred wild pollen and nectar sources of his honey bees.

His ceaseless hours of observation resulted in the 1920 book 
American Honey Plants, possibly still the best publication of its 
kind in existence. In another book, Our Backyard Neighbors, Frank 
wrote of himself and his pollinator garden in the third person say-
ing, “There were many wild flowers, such as asters and goldenrod, 
crownbeard and rudbeckia, which the neighbors regarded as weeds, 
but which the Naturalist guarded with jealous care.”

Along with Edith Patch and Frank Pellett, the late Canadian 

scientist Dr. Eva Crane played one of the largest roles in further 
inspiring early thinking about pollinator gardens. Although she 
was formally educated as a quantum mathematician and nuclear 
physicist, the gift of a beehive in 1942 (as a supplement to war-time 
sugar rationing) led Eva to devote the next five decades of her life to 
publishing nearly 200 books and articles on honey plants and indig-
enous beekeeping.

Her writing was based on her field research in more than 

60 countries, where she often lived under primitive conditions, even 
in her later years. Her rigorous and exacting books, such as the 
Directory of Important World Honey Sources, are the most com-
prehensive attempts of their kind to document the nutritional value 
of pollen and nectar from thousands of species of plants, as well as 
those plants’ potential honey yields.

In their own ways each of these deeply inquisitive champions 
of pollinator habitat inspired small communities of beekeepers and 
conservationists to see the landscape through a different lens. Plants 
previously scorned as weeds and unproductive “waste” areas on 
farms began to have value to at least a small segment of people, even 
as urbanization and agriculture intensified with enthusiasm.

By 1950 even the USDA Soil Conservation Service, the agency 
most responsible for saving American agriculture from itself during 
the Dust Bowl, recognized the value of pollinators. It distributed a 
simple educational bulletin to Midwest farmers, featuring an illus-
tration of bumble bees flying between a hedgerow and a clover crop 
with the earnest title Wild Bees are Good Pollinators. The bulletin 
lists important habitat areas on the farm to protect for pollinators 
including streambanks, woodlots, shelterbelts, and field borders. 
For good effect the bulletin even features an illustrated bag of clover 
seed with a dollar sign across its front.

Surprisingly, the dawn of the environmental movement 

brought little attention to pollinators during the 1960s, ’70s, and 
’80s, although countless other important conservation issues finally 
received some long-overdue attention. Only when large-scale honey 
bee losses began to make headlines in 2006 did the conservation 
community again focus much on the role of pollinators. By that time 
several U.S. bumble bee species were dwindling toward extinction, 
and once-common monarch butterfly populations were in free-fall. 
Now books and articles about pollinator conservation are every-
where. For those of us at Xerces who have been working on and 
writing about pollinators for decades, this long-overdue attention is 
gratifying and energizing.

The spiritual tradition of this particular book descends from 

Patch, Pellett, and Crane, but also from John Muir, Aldo Leopold, 
Rachel Carson, and many others. These are the writers who 
inspired us here at Xerces in our youth and early in our careers, and 
who ultimately helped bring us all together as the big extended fam-
ily that we are today. Our goal, like that of the conservation writers 
who preceded us, is not just to preach the gospel, but also to invite 
you into the tribe. We hope that you will join us.

The initiation is simple: just plant flowers.

Plants and Pollinators: 

An Overview

W H E N W E OB S E RV E A N I M A L S pollinating nearly 90 percent 
of the plant species found on earth, we are witnessing a process 
more than 250 million years in the making. Sexual reproduction 
among plants, from a botanical standpoint, is nothing more than the 
transfer of pollen grains from a flower’s male anthers to a flower’s 
female stigmas, enabling fertilization. Once transferred, pollen 
grains germinate, grow pollen tubes into the plant’s ovaries, and 
deliver gametes to produce seed and endosperm.

In very primitive plants, this process was carried out by wind 

or water. Between 245 and 200 million years ago, however, the first 
flowering plants arose, with the earliest fossil records containing rel-
atives of today’s magnolias and water lilies. During this prehistoric 
timeframe, flowering plants evolved two major reproductive adapta-
tions: exposed male stamens that bear small, nutrient-rich pollen 
grains; and enclosed female carpels that protect ovules. These adap-
tations accelerated plant reproduction (and pollinator diversity), 
leading to diverse and dominant communities of flowering plants 
that almost 100 million years ago had spread across the globe.

Creating Habitat
T H E R E A R E O T H E R F I N E books on habitat design for pol-
linators and beneficial insects, including the Xerces Society titles 
Attracting Native Pollinators and Farming with Native Beneficial 
Insects, so we do not cover that design and installation process in 
this book. However, here are some basic guidelines to consider 
when creating habitat for bees.

Provide large and contiguous habitat patches. Where possible, 

pollinator gardens, wildflower meadows, and habitat patches at 
least 5,000 square feet in size can offer a wonderfully productive 
landscape feature for sustaining honey bees, butterflies, and count-
less wild bees alike. To sustain wild pollinators for crop production 
on farms the current research suggests that 10 to 30% of a farm 
should be maintained in natural habitat to support both wild bees 
for crop pollination, and beneficial insects for natural pest control.
Within these areas, plants can be scattered about, but clumps 

or groupings of similar plants (of at least 4 square feet [1 square 
meter]) seem to be especially attractive to pollinators. This proxim-
ity reduces their foraging time so that they can spend more time 
mating, nesting, and raising future generations of pollinators.

Plant diversity also enhances pollinator populations, as previ-

ously mentioned. To attract a great diversity of wild bees a land-
scape should feature at least 12 to 20 species of flowering plants and 
have at least three species of blooming plants at any given time.
Most important, whatever you plant, the habitat must be 

protected from insecticides (see box). We recommend at least a 
50-foot-wide buffer (preferably 100-foot) between any pollinator 
habitat and areas such as cropland where insecticides are used.

locally common, these enormous wildflowers 
have disappeared from the landscape with the 
loss of native prairies. In addition to attracting 
pollinators, the Silphiums provide excellent seed 
for songbirds. The common name of cup plant 
refers to the leaves that clasp the stem, forming 
cups that collect rainwater. It’s common to see 
birds drinking from these cups.

This set the stage for more complex plant-pollinator relationships 
to evolve, including prehistoric flowering plants that first attracted 
passive pollinators by providing sugary nectar, protein-packed 
 pollen, fragrant resins, and vitamin-rich fats.

Flowers then responded to particular pollinators, co-evolving 
with them to provide diverse bloom-times, colors, scents, shapes, 
sizes, and rewards and improving their reproductive efficiency. For 
example, flattened, large, scented, off-white flowers with accessible 
pollen, such as magnolia, attracted beetles, while tubular, large,

Meanwhile, flowers also developed a variety of strategies to avoid 

self-fertilization and encourage genetic diversity:

•  self-incompatibility

•  physical distance between (male) anthers and (female) stigmas

•  male and female flower structures that are fertile at different times

•  separate male and female plants

Enter the Bees
T H E W I DE S P R E A D DI S T R I B U T ION OF diverse flower-
ing plants 100 million years ago coincided with the appearance of 
intentional pollinators: bees. Bees are believed to have co-evolved 
with flowers from predatory wasps. In general, both bees and wasps 
consume sugars as adults and proteins as larvae. Herbivorous bee 
larvae eat pollen as their protein source, however, while wasp larvae 
are typically carnivorous.

Pollen is essential for the reproduction of both bees and flow-
ers, so the two groups have co-evolved for mutual success. Adult 
bees evolved behavioral and physiological adaptations to gather and 
transport pollen more efficiently, such as:

BUZZ-POLLINATION. Flight muscles can create sound vibrations that 
dislodge pollen from flowers.

FLORAL CONSTANCY. An individual pollinator may specialize in for-
aging one flower type.

POLLEN-COLLECTING HAIRS. The “pollen basket” and other special-
ized hairs on a bee’s body carry pollen back to the colony.

Although most bees are pollen generalists, capable of foraging 

on many plant species, many are specialists that forage on only a 
small group of specific flowers.

What Makes a Good Pollinator Plant?
A F L OW E R’S C OL OR , OD OR , shape, size, timing, and reward 
(nectar or pollen) can increase or decrease the number of visits by 
specific pollinators. Some examples of how plants “reach out” to 
bees and others:

ULTRAVIOLET INVITATIONS. Bees can see ultraviolet light but not red 
light; thus, ultraviolet-hued flowers attract more bee visits, while 
red-hued flowers reduce them.

COLOR PHASES. Many flowers signal pollinators by changing color 
at different stage of development, attracting pollinators when they 
need them most, and increasing the efficiency of the pollinators they 
depend upon.

NECTAR GUIDES. Contrasting patterns of flower shades, tints, and 
tones further direct pollinators toward floral rewards such as nectar 
or pollen, much like the nighttime runway lights of an airport.

FRAGRANCE. Minty or sweet, musky or ethereal, pungent or 
putrid, floral odors result from variations in chemical compounds. 
Fragrance can attract particular pollinators over long distances, 
varying in concentration and intensity according to species, flower 
age, and site conditions.

C O N T R A S T I N G 
C O L O R S , this 
blanketflower ushers 
pollinators toward 
the nectar and pollen 
at the center of the 
bloom.

Flower shape, size, 

and timing work together 
with color and odor to regu-
late pollinator visits. Abundant 
and diverse shapes and sizes, 
symmetrical or asymmetrical forms, arrangements on stems or 
branches in simple or complex groups, maturing at different rates: 
these variations can make it easier or harder for visitors to reach 
nectar and pollen.

For example, shallow, clustered flowers with landing platforms 
(such as sunflowers) have easily accessible floral rewards and attract 
many short-tongued pollinators such as sweat bees, beetles, and 
flies. In contrast, deep or tubular flowers without landing platforms 
often have hidden floral rewards accessible only by long-tongued 
or strong pollinators. A classic example of this latter flower type 
is bottle or closed gentian (Gentiana spp.), whose flowers remain 
closed and depend for pollination on bumble bees, which pry the 
petals apart and climb right inside.

Finally, many plants bloom according to a distinct seasonal 
rhythm — their phenology — which may be closely timed with 
the lifecycle of specific pollinators. Others, meanwhile, bloom con-
tinuously or irregularly during the growing season, attracting many 
different types of pollinators. These rhythms can invite or exclude 
different pollinators depending upon the season or even the hour.

Risks and Rewards of Flower Foraging
OF C OU R S E , P OL L I NAT OR S MO S T OF T E N visit flowers for 
nutrient-rich food rewards: pollen and nectar. The availability and 
quality of these rewards vary depending on time of day, environ-
mental factors, and an individual plant’s lifecycle. And from the 
perspective of a bee, butterfly, or other pollinator, several factors 
can make a particular flower useful, or not.

Nutrition
F L OR A L R E WA R D S I NC LU DE P OL L E N, nectar, oils, and/or 
resins, depending on the plant species.

POLLEN, the most protein-rich of these rewards, is essential to bee 
reproduction. Once gathered, adult bees typically mix pollen with 
nectar and glandular secretions to form a nutritious “bee bread,” 
which forms the diet of larval bees. Pollen grains vary from 10 to 
100 micrometers in size, have distinctive shapes, and commonly 
contain protein levels ranging from 2%–60% (including 10 essential 
amino acids, as well as varying concentrations of carbohydrates, 
lipids, sterols, and other micronutrients). While some bees, such as 
the common European honey bee, are generalist pollinators whose 
diets are not restricted to particular pollen types, others are special-
ists of pollen from particular flowers, including various mining bees, 
cellophane bees, and resin bees.

NECTAR is composed chiefly of carbohydrates and water, with low 
levels of amino acids, lipids, proteins, and various vitamins and 
minerals. Carbohydrates, primarily the sugars sucrose, fructose, 
and glucose, can range in concentrations from 10% to 70% based on 
species and weather. It is this sugar-rich food source that fuels adult 
bees, butterflies, and a myriad of other flower visitors, such as bats 
and hummingbirds. Nectar secretion, even within the same species 
of plant, can vary depending on humidity, precipitation, time of 
day, temperature, wind, latitude, soil, and various other factors. In 
turn, the pollinators visiting those blossoms may encounter short-
term booms and busts of nectar availability.

»  Plants Meet Pollinators16

OILS AND RESINS are secreted by some flowers to attract bees. 
Specialized floral glands produce calorie-rich, medicinal oils that 
are regularly collected by a few bees (for example, Macropis spp. 
and Melitta spp.) and mixed with pollen and nectar for feeding and 
medicating larvae. Most likely, such flower resins first evolved to 
protect the plants from herbivores or disease. Eventually bees came 
to use them as a food source, and as a resin for constructing anti-
microbial and waterproof nests.

Non-Floral Rewards
NON-F L OR A L (OR “ E X T R A-F L OR A L”) R E WA R D S include 
nectar, honeydew, fruits, and saps.

EXTRA-FLORAL NECTAR is produced by many plants as sugary droplets 
from glands on leaves, stems, and other non-flowering plant parts. 
These nectar droplets attract beneficial predatory insects, such as ants, 
beetles, flies, mites, spiders, and wasps — all of which may attack 
plant pests. Among some plants, these extra-floral nectaries may 
supply even more nectar than the flowers do themselves. While less 
showy and aromatic than flowers, extra-floral nectaries are usually 
open and exposed for easy access by many types of beneficial insects 
(although not infrequently they are guarded by territorial ants!).

HONEYDEW is the sugary excrement of sap-feeding aphids, scale 
insects, whiteflies and some butterfly caterpillars (mostly the blues, in 
the family Lycaenidae). Like extra-floral nectar it is eagerly collected 
by many beneficial insects, including ants, bees, and wasps. In some 
locations, in fact, aphid honeydew is found in large enough quantities 
to produce small surplus honey crops. Honeydew is readily acces-
sible but occasionally it, or the insects producing it, are guarded by 
ants. Think of ants tending aphids as though they were livestock, and 
you have a fairly accurate picture of this unique insect relationship.

PROPOLIS, also known as bee glue, is a resinous sap mixture col-
lected from plants by bees and harvested by humans. Particular 
plants, including conifers and poplars, exude these resins from buds 
or from injuries as a natural anti-microbial defense.

Plants and Pollinators: An Overview  «17

Honey bees collect propolis to construct and defend hives, 
weatherproof small cracks and holes, smooth surfaces, dampen 
vibrations, and protect themselves from bacteria, fungi, mites, and 
other intruders. Humans harvest and use honey bee propolis in 
 cosmetics, soaps, medicines, and wood polishes or varnishes.

Species of solitary mason bees also collect propolis to construct, 

partition, and seal nests.

Other Rewards
B E YON D P OL L E N A N D N E C TA R , plants sustain pollinators 
in several other ways, and the most familiar of these is as caterpillar 
food for butterflies. With only a few exceptions, the vast majority of 
butterfly and moth caterpillars are herbivores that feed exclusively 
on plant foliage. Depending on the species, those caterpillars may 
be generalists, which can feed on many types of plants, or special-
ists with a very narrow range of plants on which they can success-
fully feed.

The specialists often acquire defensive chemical compounds 
from the plants they feed upon (such as alkaloids, cardenolides, or 
glycosides) that make those insects unpalatable or toxic to preda-
tors. For example, milkweed butterfly caterpillars such as the 
monarch and queen feed exclusively on milkweed (Asclepias spp.) 
foliage, which contains toxic cardenolides that repel most vertebrate 
predators.

Other than food resources, plants also offer nesting, egg-laying, 
and overwintering resources for pollinators, such as hollow or pithy 
canes; stalks, stems, or twigs; leaves, petals, or plant fibers; and 
exfoliating or peeling bark. Plants with hollow or pithy branches, 
such as brambles (Rubus spp.), elderberry (Sambucus spp.), and 
sumac (Rhus spp.), are used extensively as nesting spaces for a wide 
range of wild solitary bees and wasps. For example:

Nearly 30 percent of North American native bee species nest 

in hollow stems or abandoned beetle borer holes — including 
leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.), mason bees (Hoplitis spp.; Osmia 
spp.), small carpenter bees (Ceratina spp.), and masked bees 
(Hylaeus spp.).

LEAFCUT TER BEES cut round sections of leaves or pet-
als to wrap around their developing larva and pollen 
stores, similar to a carefully wrapped origami package.

CARDER BEES (Anthidium spp.) comb plant fibers from the 
surface of fuzzy leaves and use them to create a wooly, felted 

plug that closes off the entrance to their nests inside hollow 

stems.

GRASS-CARRYING WASPS (Isodontia spp.) gather grasses to plug up 
the entrance to their nests, building a grass barrier against other 
insects that would otherwise steal the food intended for their devel-
oping brood.

Risk Management
F OR AGI NG F OR F O OD  can be risky for pollinators. In the pro-
cess of visiting flowers an individual insect may encounter preda-
tors, disease vectors, or bad weather. The farther an insect has to 
travel, and the more energy it has to exert in collecting food, the 
more risk it is exposed to. Plants that provide an abundance of 
quickly accessible, nutrient-packed pollen and nectar obviously 
provide the greatest reward, and allow insect visitors to get on with 
the business of mating and reproduction.

more effectively sustain pollinators throughout the seasons than do 
landscapes dominated by only a small handful of flowering plants. 
At a landscape scale, the presence or absence of different types of 
blooming plants can result in a “feast or famine” situation for polli-
nators. Thus, expansive landscapes of weedy or invasive plants such 
as purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) or Himalayan blackberry 
(Rubus armeniacus) may provide an abundance of food for bees 
and other pollinators during their bloom period. Once the bloom is 
over, however, pollinators may suffer as those same invasive plants 
that temporarily sustained them now crowd out other types of wild 
plants that would otherwise have provide a variety of flower types 
throughout the entire growing season.

invasive in most landscapes (although a few of the more tenacious 
non-natives, such as sweetclover, deserve a bit of responsible scru-
tiny before introducing them to new places). Where the pollinator 
plants featured in this book are already present, they should be con-

Creating Habitat
T H E R E A R E O T H E R F I N E books on habitat design for pol-
linators and beneficial insects, including the Xerces Society titles 
Attracting Native Pollinators and Farming with Native Beneficial 
Insects, so we do not cover that design and installation process in 
this book. However, here are some basic guidelines to consider 
when creating habitat for bees.

Provide large and contiguous habitat patches. Where possible, 

pollinator gardens, wildflower meadows, and habitat patches at 
least 5,000 square feet in size can offer a wonderfully productive 
landscape feature for sustaining honey bees, butterflies, and count-
less wild bees alike. To sustain wild pollinators for crop production 
on farms the current research suggests that 10 to 30% of a farm 
should be maintained in natural habitat to support both wild bees 
for crop pollination, and beneficial insects for natural pest control.
Within these areas, plants can be scattered about, but clumps 

or groupings of similar plants (of at least 4 square feet [1 square 
meter]) seem to be especially attractive to pollinators. This proxim-
ity reduces their foraging time so that they can spend more time 
mating, nesting, and raising future generations of pollinators.

Plant diversity also enhances pollinator populations, as previ-

ously mentioned. To attract a great diversity of wild bees a land-
scape should feature at least 12 to 20 species of flowering plants and 
have at least three species of blooming plants at any given time.
Most important, whatever you plant, the habitat must be 

protected from insecticides (see box). We recommend at least a 
50-foot-wide buffer (preferably 100-foot) between any pollinator 
habitat and areas such as cropland where insecticides are used.

Plants and Pollinators: An Overview  «21

Site Preparation
F I NA L LY, NO T E T H AT  in landscapes heavily dominated by 
weeds and aggressive grasses, it can be hard to establish pollinator 
habitats such as prairies and meadows. Site preparation — remov-
ing those weeds before restoring an area in wildflowers — is chal-
lenging, but essential. You can clear an area by cultivating, using 
prescribed fire, applying herbicides, and cover-cropping for one or 
more growing seasons.

At Xerces, our currently preferred method is soil solarization. 

This technique uses sheets of clear greenhouse plastic to cover, 
heat, and kill weeds and weed seeds over patches of ground for a 
full growing season, before removing the sheets and seeding new 
wildflowers into the clean area. We even save the plastic and re-use 
it over multiple seasons, slowly expanding habitat areas on farms 
and in gardens year after year. It works beautifully for us.

Once planted, these wildflower meadows tend to be long-lived, 
although they do need occasional weeding and mowing to keep out 
invasive plants. You can find more information about the process of 
native plant restoration and long-term habitat management in the 
resources at the end of this book.

Pollinators and Pesticides

M A K E YOUR G A R DEN A S A F E H AV EN F OR P OL L IN AT OR S 
BY AVOIDING PE S T ICIDE USE. Insecticides, including those 
used to control garden pests, tend to be broadly toxic to pollinators as 
well as to pests, and even some organic insecticides can pose a risk.

Pollinators are exposed to insecticides in gardens through direct 
contact with spray and residues on flowers or ingestion of insecticide 
residues present in pollen, nectar, or water. Pollinators can be killed 
outright by insecticidal exposure, but smaller, nonlethal doses can 
also be problematic. These lower doses can impair pollinators, alter-
ing their behavior, movement, growth, reproduction, and immune 
response to parasites and pathogens. Insecticide exposure can 
reduce pollinator populations quickly and recovery to pre-exposure 
levels can require years.

You can prevent problems by reducing the conditions that encourage 
pest outbreaks.

1.  When purchasing plants, inquire at the nursery to be certain the 

ones you select are pesticide free.

2.  Monitor your plants to make sure they are healthy.

3.  Plant a diversity of species that provide food and shelter for ben-
eficial insects that will help control pest populations in your yard 
and garden.

Some plants for purchase at nurseries or home improvement stores 
have been treated with neonicotinoid insecticides during the pro-
duction process. Neonicotinoids, a group of systemic chemicals, are 
long-lasting in soil and within plants, and can be present in pollen 
and nectar of the flowers of treated plants long after you bring them 
home from the store. Even in small doses, neonicotinoids are harm-
ful to pollinators.

P roviding wildflower-rich habitat 

is the most significant action you 

can take to support pollinators. Native 
plants, which are adapted to local soils 
and climates, are usually the best sources 
of nectar and pollen for native pollina-
tors. In addition, native plants often 
require less water than non-natives, do 
not need fertilizers, and are less likely to 
become weedy. Here, we present some of 
our favorite North American native wild-
flowers for pollinators.

even to sweet clover. The sugar concentration in giant hyssop 
nectar reportedly exceeds 40%, and the resulting honey is light in 
color, slightly minty in flavor, and resistant to granulation.

Nearly a dozen species of blanketflower are 

found in North America, but only two are widely 
available as seed or garden plants. Blanketflower 
(Gaillardia aristata) is a perennial species of the 
northern plains, Rocky Mountains, and inland 
Northwest. Indian blanket (G. pulchella) is an 
annual species occurring from Arizona across the 
southern plains, Gulf Coast, and Florida.

reported routine honey yields averaging 80 pounds per colony and 
described the honey as white and quick to granulate. The average 
sugar concentration in the nectar of blue curls has been reported 
at 27%. As an annual plant, blue curls probably requires some 
periodic disturbance, such as fire or occasional grazing, to encourage 
re-seeding. As with other native species, however, too much 
disturbance or crowding by invasive species will reduce its numbers.

species, including the common farewell to spring or godetia (Clarkia 
amoena), have made their way into the ornamental plant trade. Seed 
for these is widely available. They are probably not prolific nectar or 
pollen producers, but they have the distinct advantage of blooming 
in early to midsummer when most other West Coast wildflowers 
are finished for the year. This bloom time, along with the low cost 
of seed, fast establishment, and aggressive reseeding, makes them 
a valuable addition to pollinator meadows along the West Coast.

500 pounds of honey. The flower nectar has been described as 18 to 
32% sugar, and the resulting honey is clear, light yellow, and aroma-

15. FIREWEED

(Chamerion angustifolium)

A P L A N T OF C O OL C L I M AT E S and high altitudes, fireweed 

thrives in moist areas where fires have eliminated woody 

plants. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for long periods, then 
rapidly germinate when forest clearings occur, such as after a fire — 
hence its common name. In such areas fireweed can suddenly appear 
in tremendous abundance but then quickly fade in subsequent years 
as the forest grows back, or as unfavorable weather patterns (such 
as drought) reduce flowering. Fireweed offers a long show, typically 
from June through August, with new blossoms opening on flower 
spikes to replace old blooms over many weeks.

Fireweed is not commonly available from seed, since the seed is 
tiny and attached to silky filaments, making planting a challenge. It 
grows easily from root or rhizome cuttings and will rapidly expand 
in large colonies as long as space and soil conditions are favorable. 
In the Pacific Northwest where fireweed reaches its optimal height,

honey plants in the northern hemisphere, with honey yields from 
50 to 125 pounds per colony. The honey is light in color, sometimes 
described as “lightly spicy” or “buttery,” and highly valued as a pre-

17. GOLDENROD

(Solidago spp.)

G OL DE N R OD S A R E A MONG the most important late-season 

pollinator plants. Honey bees frequently collect large amounts 

of goldenrod nectar prior to winter; other bees use the pollen to 
provision late-season nests. Many beekeepers in the Northeast depend 
on goldenrod as their colonies’ primary winter food source and often 
report honey gains of 50 to 80 pounds per colony. Goldenrod honey 
is typically dark, thick, somewhat pungent in aroma, and quick to 
granulate. The average sugar concentration in the nectar of some 
goldenrod species has been reported at approximately 33%.

The number of goldenrod species is vast, and it can be difficult 

to distinguish among them. While western states and provinces 
lack the sheer abundance of goldenrods found in the East, a locally 
adapted goldenrod probably exists anywhere you are. In general, 
goldenrods thrive in open areas with occasional mowing to remove 
competition from trees and shrubs.

two commercially available species are among the larger members of 
the genus and produce the brightest blooms in partial shade. Both 
are adapted to damp soils, making them excellent for rain gardens 
and other temporarily wet situations. Honey bees can’t “see” the 
flowers of cardinal flower: the blooms would appear black to them. 
When they do find the plant, however, they frantically mob it and 
rob it of nectar, because it is a prolific producer.

Of the more than two dozen species in 

North America, only two are regularly avail-

red-blossomed cardinal flower (L. cardinalis).

NO TA BL E F L O W E R V I S I T OR S

Great blue lobelia is an exceptional bumble bee 

plant, attracting few other insects. Cardinal flower is 
pollinated by hummingbirds and is visited by a few 
butterflies, especially monarchs, for nectar. Honey 
bees’ tongues are too short to extract nectar from 
the blossom opening, so instead they insert their 
tongues into the base of the long blossoms, bypass-
ing the reproductive structures of the flowers and 
robbing cardinalflower of nectar. Consequently, the 
flowers may be less attractive to the plant’s legiti-
mate pollinators, with unknown consequences for 
the plant’s chances of reproducing.

In the eastern U.S. and Canada, perennial lupine 

(Lupinus perennis) is the most widely distributed 
species, best in deep sandy soils. This species is 
the host plant for the endangered Karner blue but-
terfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), and the loss of 
lupine from the landscape has pushed the butterfly 
close to extinction. Silvery lupine (L. argenteus) 
is one of the most widely distributed species 
throughout the Great Basin, Rocky Mountains, 
and desert Southwest. 

In California, yellow-flowered annual golden 

lupine (L. densiflorus) has performed well in 
Xerces Society pollinator meadows and cover 
crops at farms across the state, and the perennial 
summer lupine (L. formosus) has proven an excel-
lent bumble bee plant. In rainy areas of the Pacific 
Northwest, riverbank lupine (L. rivularis) rapidly, 
almost aggressively, establishes 
itself in seeded pollinator mead-
ows, successfully crowding out 
weeds. It mixes well with 
Puget Sound gumweed, 
and despite the common 
name, doesn’t require 
riverbanks as habitat.

honey with a flavor frequently compared to marshmallows or 

vanilla. In the wild these annuals are primarily found in temporarily 
flooded or vernal pools in California and southern Oregon. 
Despite that limited range and habitat requirement, meadowfoam 
is surprisingly adaptable and grows well in many areas along the 
West Coast. It is now a staple or “workhorse plant” in most Xerces 
pollinator seed mixes in the maritime Pacific Northwest, reseeding 
very well and integrating successfully with species such as farewell to 
spring (Clarkia amoena) and Oregon phacelia (Phacelia nemoralis). In 
addition to seed mixes, meadowfoam is a good choice for a cover crop

thistle. Several dozen wild, nonweedy thistles once existed as part 
of most prairie, meadow, grassland, and desert ecosystems in North 
America. Some are short-lived plants that depend on soil disturbance 
to germinate and grow, only to be crowded out by longer-lived, more 
aggressive species.

Native thistles support pollinators and songbirds such as finches 
and indigo buntings. Unfortunately, they are disappearing from the 
landscape due to habitat loss, eradication efforts targeting invasive 
alien thistles, and exotic thistle-feeding insects released to control 
Canada thistle. Thistle honey is clear or white and has been compared 
to basswood honey in flavor.

spread species. Tall thistle (C. altissimum), typi-

heights of 8 feet or more in optimal soils. A west-
ern species, cobweb thistle (C. occidentale), is 
covered with white hairs, tinting the entire plant 
a bright white that contrasts strikingly with its 
blood red flowers. Unfortunately seed of these

common visitors; when foraging on purple coneflowers they are 
frequently observed with full pollen baskets, suggesting that the 
plants are important for supplementing and diversifying bee diets.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN 
BEE PLANT

L A N K Y B U T DA Z Z L I NG, this purple-flowered western dryland plant has long 

been considered an important honey plant, with reports of honey yields greater 

than 100 pounds per colony over a 10-day period, and 2 to 3 supers (surplus honey 
boxes) added per colony over a 3-week period. The resulting greenish white honey 
has been described as variable, with an unpleasant flavor that improves with age. Since 
the plant and its close relatives can tolerate soil and climate conditions where few other 
plants grow, they are regionally important. The average sugar concentration in the 
nectar of Rocky Mountain bee plant has been reported at 21–29%.

Annual pink-flowered Rocky Mountain bee plant (Cleome serrulata) grows in dis-

turbed semi-moist rangeland soils. Its close relative, the annual yellow bee plant (C. 
lutea), grows in even harsher conditions including areas of alkali soils with less than 
10 inches of annual rainfall. In the deserts of southern California, the shrub bladder-
pod (Peritoma arborea, formerly Isomelis arborea) is a close relative that also survives 
on minimal annual rainfall, while blooming abundantly and almost continuously 
throughout the year. It is very attractive to honey bees and an excellent choice for 
farm hedgerows in drought-prone areas.

natives and nonnatives, many salvias have been cultivated 

as ornamental garden plants. Several are considered important 
honey bee forage plants while others, especially red-flowered 
species, are more likely to attract hummingbirds. Though salvias 
are commonly called sage, they should not be confused with 
sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), a group of plants that attract few bees. 
The honey is pale yellow and slow to granulate. The average sugar

reported at 44%.

Many salvias succeed in pollinator 

habitat projects. Though not native, 
the garden herb sage (Salvia officinalis) 
is adapted to moderate coastal climates 
and attracts many bees. The California 
native black sage (S. mellifera) is considered 
a  premium nectar plant producing top-quality, 
heavy white honey that almost never granulates. Its 
large, shrubby size makes it a convenient hedgerow 
plant on California farms. The annual chia (S. his-
panica) — yes, the “cha-cha-cha” chia pet plant — 
is another good honey bee forage plant. It requires 
relatively even day lengths to promote flowering, 
so its value is probably restricted to the extreme 
Southwest borderlands. Its close relative desert chia 
(S. columbariae) grows farther north into Nevada 
and California. In the southern plains, the peren-
nial blue sage (S. azurea) is a beautiful component 
of remnant prairies and roadsides.

Northern Hemisphere. Though native to North America, 

many of the individual plants observed, especially in eastern North 
America, are weeds of European origin, with reduced flowers. The 
plant competes well against other vegetation, especially weedy 
grasses that choke out other, more fragile, wildflowers. When 
seeded at high enough densities, selfheal will form robust colonies 
of plants that tolerate occasional mowing and vehicle traffic. These 
characteristics make it a suitable forage plant for honey bees and 
other beneficial insects in orchard and vineyard understories.

sneezeweed (Helenium autumnale) prefers wet, disturbed 

sites such as sandy riverbanks and backwater shorelines. This 
adaptable plant is a good choice for swampy, seasonally flooded 
areas of a farm or a roadside. Honey produced from sneezeweed 
is reportedly so bitter that it ruins any other honey mixed with it. 
While sneezeweed is a very good honey producer in some areas of 
the South, beekeepers typically leave its honey on hives as a source 
of winter food for the bees.

prolifically for many weeks in midsummer, this plant deserves more 
attention by pollinator gardeners, both as a prolific nectar plant and 
as a beautiful ornamental. It also has the notable ability to thrive 
in dry shady locations where many other plants would fail. Wood 
mint spreads easily by rhizomes and expands slowly into clumps 
wherever space is available. It mixes well with spotted wild 
geranium (see page 000) and Virginia waterleaf (see page 000) 
to provide a diverse and attractive pollinator garden for shady yards 
or forest clearings.

shrub plantings may be designed for 
multiple additional purposes, such as 
wildlife, soil, and water health. Here are 
just some of the shrub and tree species 
that you might want to consider, staying

45. BASSWOOD

(Tilia americana)

A C OM MON S H A DE tree in cities, basswood is an important 

nectar source for bees and a most useful plant for beekeepers. 
It produces a pale but richly flavored honey, sometimes said to hint 
of peppermint. Its short bloom period typically lasts ten days or less, 
and the nectar flow is irregular, more abundant in some years than 
others. Production of flowers and nectar increases with soil fertility 
and sunlight, so new plantings should have rich soil and full sun.
The average sugar concentration in the nectar of basswood 

flowers has been reported at 33%, and colony honey yields as high 
as 200 pounds have been reported under favorable conditions. 
Interestingly, honey yields are larger from basswood growing in 
mixed populations as opposed to single-species plantations.

A showstopper for attracting honey bumble 

bees, metallic green sweat bees, flies, and many 
wasps. Although plants in this genus have been 
implicated in bee poisonings (due to toxic nectar), 
much debate exists on this subject, and it seems 
that the triggers for toxic nectar production are not 
well understood (although excessive dryness and 
drought may be a factor). Currently it is believed 
that European species can be more toxic to bees 
(especially bumble bees) than the native common 
basswood, although such poisoning events are 
extremely rare overall. Along with nectar, bass-
woods attract large numbers of aphids, whose cor-
responding honeydew (sugary excrement) is eagerly 
collected by many bees and wasps. Caterpillar host 
plant for the mourning cloak (Nymphalis antiopa), 
red-spotted purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax), 
and eastern tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus)

M A N Y NAT I V E A N D nonnative bramble species and 

cultivated varieties are found across the U.S. and much 
of Canada. They are valued as forage plants for honey bees as 
well as for their usually tasty berries: beekeepers report more than 
25 pounds of surplus honey per hive, especially in the Northwest 
where forest clearings and roadsides support vast numbers of the 
invasive Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus). The honey 
from these plants is white or light amber, typically very thick, 
and slow to granulate. These plants bloom right after tree fruits 
but before white clover, making them an important resource in 
farmlands and anywhere honey bees are managed.

The common red raspberries (Rubus ideaeus and R. strigosus) grow just about 

everywhere and are reliable nectar producers, especially on warm days preceded by 
cool nights. The authors have a personal bias toward the related black raspberries 
(R. occidentalis), which are also widely adapted, packed with antioxidants, and more 
complexly flavored — oh, and they attract bees too. Hybrids include the wonder-
fully delicious and prolific marionberry (Rubus ‘Marion’, a cross of ‘Chehalem’ and 
‘Olallie’), common in the Northwest, supporting bees and pie bakers alike. Beyond 
these semi-domestic options, it’s worth noting that there are various wonderful truly 
wild members of the genus that are both beautiful ornamentals in their own right 
and are pollinator magnets. One such example is salmonberry (R. spectabilis), a 
West Coast native of cool forest streambanks. Featuring bright magenta flowers, it’s 
a great option for cool, shady native plant gardens.

BLACK LOCUST

C ONS I DE R E D A N E XC E L L E N T honey plant by many 

beekeepers, with a short but impressive blooming period, 

black locust attracts a variety of other bees as well as hummingbirds, 
bizarrely large hummingbird (sphinx) moths, and much more. The 
tree has sharp thorns, a shallow root system prone to suckering, and 
a high tolerance for drought, deicing salt, and air pollution. These 
traits make it hard to get rid of black locust where you don’t want it, 
but they also make the plant highly adaptable to harsh exposed sites 
such as parking lot plantings. While in some places it is considered 
an invasive weed because it self-sows readily, it was in past times 
cultivated as a source of tough wood for posts and railroad ties.

The honey produced from these trees is thick, 
watery white, and slow to granulate. Nectar produc-
tion is believed to be highest in younger plants, so 
it may be worth cutting them back to stumps every 
15 years and encouraging suckering and new growth. 
The sugar concentration of black locust nectar has been 
reported as high as 63%, with honey production of more 
than 170 pounds per hive. (Some of that probably comes from 
bees collecting aphid honeydew.)

48. BLUEBERRY

(Vaccinium spp.)

G L O S S Y S U M M E R L E AV E S and fiery fall foliage make 

blueberry a three-season ornamental as well as an important 
fruit and nectar producer. It requires evenly moist but well-drained 
soil that is quite acidic. Cultivated varieties planted as a commercial 
crop typically have a short, uniform bloom period. Wild blueberries 
in their native habitat (and their close relatives, wild huckleberries) 
secrete nectar over several weeks, as individual plants have slightly 
different but overlapping bloom periods. Commercial beekeepers 
travel to Maine every year to pollinate the lowbush blueberry crop 
(estimated at 44,000 acres). The honey is thick and light amber 
in color.

Native wild lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) occurs throughout eastern 

Canada, the Great Lakes, and New England, supporting equally enthusiastic popula-
tions of people, birds, and bees. Highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum), a close relative 
found from New England west to Michigan, has larger fruits and flowers and, like other 
blueberries, requires bee pollination to maximize yields. Across the South from Florida 
to Texas and north to North Carolina, rabbiteye blueberry (V. virgatum) is a common 
farm and garden crop. Numerous wild relatives including cranberries (V. macrocarpon) 
and various huckleberries, bearberries, lingonberries are all fantastic pollinator plants.

Small bell-shaped flowers mean the pollen and 

nectar are accessible only to very small bees that can 
climb inside or large bees with tongues long enough 
to reach completely in. Bumble bees will sonicate 
or buzz-pollinate the blossoms to shake off the pol-
len (see page XX). Honey bees, carpenter bees, 
and short-tongued bumble bees are known to rob 
nectar from blueberries by biting holes in the backs 
of flowers. Hummingbirds visit the flowers of wild 
huckleberry plants. Vaccinium specialist bees include 
Andrena bradleyi, A. carolina, Panurginus atramon-
tensis, Habropoda laboriosa, Colletes productus, 
Osmia virga, Melitta americana, and Melitta eick-

55. INKBERRY

(Ilex glabra)

B E E K E E P E R L OR E I S rich with anecdotes about honey 

bees ignoring other floral sources when inkberry is in bloom. 
Whether true or not, it does supply light-colored non-granulating 
honey with yields reportedly approaching 300 pounds per hive. Also 
known as gallberry, this native holly is widespread in the eastern 
U.S. and Canada but most common in the Southeast, where it has a 
well-deserved reputation for productivity among beekeepers. Plants 
bloom for roughly a month, producing more than 100 pounds of 
surplus honey per hive in optimal locations. Inkberry is a good bee-
scaping choice for moist lowland soils. In addition to supporting 
bees, the berries of this shrub or small tree are an important source 
of winter food for birds. Ornamental gardeners value it for its small, 
glossy evergreen leaves and its berries that turn black like buttonbush 
berries, and its ability to thrive in part shade and in moist soils.

A DA P T E D T O H U M I D coastal sites as well as dry foothills 

and canyon areas, madrone serves as a good erosion-
control species and readily thrives in areas prone to frequent 
disturbance, including periodic burning. Shiny terracotta-colored 
bark, and the potential to reach towering heights on slender trunks, 
makes these graceful trees a wonderful ornamental addition to 
landscapes (although they can be notoriously difficult to establish 
as transplants). Clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in mid-spring 
develop into red berries that provide food for birds, deer, and other 
wildlife. Madrone is also a prolific nectar producer with an average 
sugar concentration of 15%.

few introduced species that are now found elsewhere. Note that 
some magnolias are deciduous while others are evergreen. All 
grow best in rich, slightly acidic soil.

58. MANZANITA

(Arctostaphylos spp.)

R E L AT E D T O B LU E B E R R I E S, manzanitas make up a 

huge group of evergreen flowering trees and shrubs, with the 
greatest diversity found in California. Kinnikinnick or bearberry, a 
low-growing species found throughout most of the United States 
and Canada, is an excellent pollinator plant and a great ground 
cover. Some manzanitas are said to have so much nectar that it can 
easily be shaken from flowers on warm days. In parts of California 
an occasional surplus honey crop has been reported from these 
plants, perhaps resulting from the long bloom time (more than a 
month) of some species — and from the high sugar concentration 
of manzanita nectar, reported to range from 16 to 50%. Manzanita 
honey has been described as light in color but slightly bitter.

59. MESQUITE

(Prosopis spp.)

T OUGH, DR OUGH T-T OL E R A N T T R E E S, mesquites 

thrive in hot sunny environments where both humans and 
livestock value their shade in summer months. They are native 
to arid and tropical regions and one of the most important honey 
sources in Texas, the Southwest, and Mexico. The light-amber 
honey regularly shows up even in large grocery stores, commanding 
decent prices. Honey crops of more than 200 pounds have often 
been reported from mesquite trees, although nectar flow can be 
variable based upon weather conditions. It is believed that the best 
nectar flows occur after a wet spring followed by very hot summer 
weather. Like acacias (which mesquite resembles) these plants also 
support birds with seeds and nesting sites.

have occasionally been documented to die from 
rhododendron nectar, due to the presence of the

SAW PALMETTO

A L OW- GR OW I NG S C RU B palm, saw palmetto is ubiquitous 

in thickets in sandy soils across Florida and Gulf Coast 
woodlands. Although the plant is not typically available from 
commercial nurseries, it is worth recognizing its value and prioritizing 
its conservation as part of the woodland plant community. Despite 
their small size, saw palmetto plants are extremely long-lived 
(possibly hundreds of years) and able to resprout following forest 
fires, seeming to flower more abundantly on new growth. Among 
beekeepers, saw palmetto is famous for its abundant spring nectar 
flow. It produces thick, delicious, lemon-yellow honey that some 
argue is the best produced in Florida. Beekeepers regularly report 
50–80-pound honey surpluses per colony from this plant.

T H E S E H A N D S OM E P Y R A M I D -S H A P E D trees thrive in 

moist, peaty, acidic soil. In fall they produce striking scarlet-

red foliage in the fall that rivals the color of any maple. This beautiful 
fall show endears sourwood to home gardeners. In the wild it 
grows in mixed-oak forests and typically remains small under the 
competition of a larger oak tree canopy; in open areas without shade 
or competition it can grow much larger. Songs and other folklore 
extol its value as a honey plant, a reputation that is well-earned. 
Sourwood is a prolific nectar plant, bearing long slender clusters of 
white bell-shaped flowers. Its honey is famous among beekeepers 
and foodies alike, with a light, lavender hue, a thick texture, and a 
slight hint of maple flavor. It is very slow to granulate. Surpluses of 
more than 70 pounds per colony have been reported.

70. TOYON

(Heteromeles arbutifolia)

O NC E A M A JOR C OM P ON E N T of California’s chaparral 

ecosystem, toyon has dark green leathery evergreen leaves 

rising from multiple stems and long-lasting red berries that are 
consumed by birds (and frequently used in holiday wreaths). It is 
ideal as a specimen shrub or as a screen when planted as a hedge. 
Its ornamental qualities and ability to survive drought, below-
freezing temperatures, and generally tough sites have made it 
increasingly common as a landscape plant outside California. The 
average sugar concentration of toyon nectar has been reported as 
44%. It produces a thick amber honey that crystallizes easily. The 
holly-like leaves and berries of toyon are supposedly the namesake 
for the city of Hollywood — and not holly itself.

F A MOUS A MONG B E E K E E P E R S, water tupelo produces 

a very light, mild, non-crystallizing honey that commands a 
high market price. Florida beekeepers even place hives on floating 
platforms along river swamps to take advantage of the tupelo 
bloom. Historically, thousands of barrels of honey were 
produced in the Apalachicola area annually. Tupelo trees 
are most at home in swamps and seasonally wet lowland 
soils. While the flowers are not particularly showy, 
scarlet autumn foliage has made this increasingly 
popular as an ornamental landscape tree. The 
more swamp-adapted species are the best honey 
producers, supporting a million-dollar specialty 
honey industry in Florida.

A N I M P ORTA N T S P R I NG food source for bees, willows 

offer the first pollen available in many areas. To take 

advantage of this, beekeepers sometimes plant willow thickets 
around apiaries to provide both a windbreak and an early-season 
source of nutrition. Willows have separate male and female plants, 
so plant males (the only ones that produce pollen) if bee forage 
is the primary goal. Both male and female willows can produce 
nectar, with the sugar concentration in nectar reported as high as 
60% in some species. Willows are easily propagated by cuttings 
that are simply planted in the ground and regularly watered. They 
also readily re-sprout from coppice cutting (cutting them back to 
stumps), creating dense, multistem thickets.

(Citrus sinensis)

O R A NGE B L O S S OM S A N D other Citrus blooms were 

formerly important for honey production, especially in Florida. 

The increase of pesticide use on citrus farms and the popularity of 
seedless orange varieties (which don’t require bee pollination) have 
led to a decline in orange blossom honey. In some regions orange 
growers have actively worked to discourage nearby beekeeping since 
pollen contamination by bees can cause seeds to develop in seedless 
oranges. When orange blossom honey was common, however, single 
colonies could produce more than 100 pounds of surplus honey in a 
good season. This honey is still much sought after: thick, white, and 
with a wonderful floral aroma. The average sugar concentration in 
the nectar of some orange species has been reported at 25%.

introduced spring-blooming trees and shrubs. Nearly all are 
high-value pollinator plants, supporting early-season bee species 
such as mining bees and mason bees. Many of these plants, 
especially the smaller shrubby wild plum species, respond well 
to coppice cutting. This technique involves periodically cutting 
the main trunk back to the ground to encourage suckering and a 
resulting denser, shorter shrublike form useful for hedgerows. The 
average sugar concentration in the nectar of some plum and cherry 
species reportedly ranges from 15 to 40%.

A N E A S Y-T O - GR OW A N N UA L , common sweet basil 

(Ocimum basilicum) supports bee visitors — but only if 

allowed to bloom. Like most kitchen herbs, it attracts a wide range 
of showy and beneficial insects while remaining largely pest-free 
itself. Inexpensive and easily available, basil is a good candidate 
for including in the home garden as a temporary insectary strip: 
a row of quick-flowering annuals sown between other food crops 
to attract beneficial insects for both pollination and pest control. At 
Xerces we’ve used basil, along with coriander and dill, to produce a 
simple insectary strip that blooms quickly and provides an ongoing 
source of herbs for the kitchen.

For maximum pollinator attractiveness basil is most effective 

in massed plantings. Lone individual plants are not likely to attract 
much attention in the home garden when other summer-blooming 
plants such as sunflowers are nearby. Basil is very susceptible to 
frost and cold-weather injury. In cold climates, start transplants 
indoors for earlier-flowering plants.

Holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum) and many cul-

tivated varieties of Ocimum basilicum are readily

typically larger, showier flowers.

to pink on borage as they age, adding an interesting shape

occasionally cultivated as a field crop for oil (used in the cosmetics 
industry) and for naturopathic medicine. More commonly it’s grown 
as a garden plant, especially in Europe where it has historically 
served as a food plant, but it grows well across most of North 
America as well. Both flowers and leaves are edible.

For longer bloom periods, stagger the seeding dates. Borage will 

adapt to many soil types but grows largest and flowers most prolifi-
cally in rich, fertile soils. The sugar in its nectar has been measured 
at 52% and produces a dark honey. Borage apparently secretes nectar 
throughout the day, and continues to yield even in cold weather.

S E V E R A L D O Z E N P E R E N N I A L and annual species of 

catnip are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some have 

escaped as naturalized weeds across the U.S. and Canada, while 
a few others are planted as garden ornamentals. Under optimal 
conditions most catnip species bloom for an extended period, 
sometimes several months. They are relatively resilient to 
alternating cycles of hot and cold weather as well as to dry 
conditions, but they grow more prolifically in fertile, 
damp soils. While deer avoid catnip, cats do not and 
can make quick work of plants that aren’t protected.

The average sugar concentration reported in 

the nectar of catnip species ranges from 22 to 
28%, and the resulting honey is dark in color and 
slightly spicy. While each individual catnip flower 
produces only a tiny amount of nectar, plants can 
produce a reliable honey surplus when grown in large 
masses.
R E C OMME NDE D S P E C IE S OR VA R IE T IE S

All types of catnip are generally good bee plants, 

including the common true catnip (Nepeta cataria). 
The ornamental hybrid Faassen’s catnip (N. × faassenii) 
is frequently planted as a ground cover or garden bor-
der plant; it grows and flowers prolifically, attracting 
huge numbers of honey bees and bumble bees.

plant, and in parts of the Middle East it is reportedly still an 

important source of honey, yielding more than 150 pounds of honey 
per colony under good conditions. In North America it continues to 
live up to its reputation as a honey bee plant, although it is not widely 
planted today. True hyssop (not to be confused with wild anise hyssop, 
Agastache spp. (see page 000), is a small, aromatic, lavender-like shrub 
native to Southern Europe and the Middle East, where it has been 
used since biblical times as a kitchen herb and medicinal plant.

Hyssop is widely thought of as drought-tolerant, but in our 

experience that seems true only on loose, well-drained soils 
where the plant can extend deep roots to extract water. 
Under good conditions this plant should reseed and 
spread over time to cover more ground as long as it has 
space.

I N E U R OP E L AV E N DE R is considered among the most 

important honey plants, especially in France where its association 

with beekeeping is famous. Aside from the connection to honey 
bees, these small evergreen Mediterranean and Middle Eastern 
shrubs are of course equally famous for culinary and cosmetic uses. 
Lavender thrives in dry climates with well-drained soil (it is perfectly 
at home in gravel soil, for example), but it tends to suffer in cool, 
high-humidity climates, especially when subjected to shade. It’s a 
good candidate for xeriscape gardens.

The sugar concentration of lavender nectar has been recorded 
at concentrations from 14 to 67%; the resulting honey is golden and 
readily granulates into small crystals creating a smooth, butterlike 
texture. Beekeepers have reported 40 pounds of surplus honey per 
colony near commercial lavender farms.

mints spread by underground rhizomes and can be aggressive 
under optimal conditions; many of the most aggressive species, 
however, such as the introduced peppermint (Mentha × piperita), 
are sterile hybrids unlikely to re-seed themselves. Surplus 
honey production approaching 200 pounds per colony has been 
documented near commercial mint fields. The honey is amber in

This wonderful evergreen plant with hemlocklike foliage and 
attractive blue flowers is well adapted to dry, exposed locations. It 
is well suited for xeriscape gardening and for use in hedges (at least

in cold climates it is sometimes grown in containers, then moved 
inside during the winter months and maintained as a house plant.
Rosemary is a honey bee plant resource with sugar concentra-
tions in the nectar of 25 to 63%. Up to 132 pounds of surplus honey 
per colony have been reported, including individual production 
rates of up to 15 pounds of rosemary honey per colony per day. The

areas between stepping stones. Several Xerces members use various 
creeping thyme species as a low-maintenance substitute for lawn grass 
(although the plants cannot sustain the same foot traffic as turf grass).

The average sugar concentration of thyme nectar has been

ALFALFA

(Medicago sativa)

C ONS I DE R E D T H E MO S T important honey plant west 

of the Missouri River, alfalfa is an important fodder and 
forage legume that depends on pollinators for seed production, 
and perennial and annual varieties support a large abundance and 
diversity of pollinators. The two bottom “keel” petals hold the 
stamen column of the alfalfa flower under tension. Visiting bees 
release the column and in the process are often struck in the head 
and dusted by pollen. Honey bees learn to bypass this process and 
rob nectar by probing the back of the flower with their tongues.
Plant alfalfa only in well-drained soils to reduce winterkill 

caused by frost heaving of roots. Nectar flows are best following wet 
springs, and average sugar concentrations commonly range between 
41 and 44%. Up to 300 pounds of honey per hive are reported when 
alfalfa fields are stocked at 2 hives per acre.

91. BUCKWHEAT

(Fagopyrum esculentum)

W E L L K NOW N A S a honey plant, buckwheat produces 

a honey that is extremely dark and pungent — the smell 
is sometimes compared to that of a dead animal — with a strong 
flavor reminiscent of molasses. Though buckwheat is grown 
and eaten like a grain, it is not technically a grain but related to 
rhubarb. It is also grown as a cover crop that develops quickly in 
warm weather, making it a valuable green manure, soil conditioner, 
and weed suppressor. Buckwheat flowers prolifically during late 
summer, with most nectar secretion occurring in the morning. 
Clusters of small, shallow white flowers with pink anthers are borne 
at the end of multiple branched stems with heart-shaped leaves.

Buckwheat requires very fertile, 

loose, moist soil, plus cool weather 
for maximum nectar flow. If any 
one of those requirements is absent, 
nectar flow will be reduced by 50% 
or more. Honey crops may vary year to 
year with yield increases up to 25 pounds 
per colony or 8 pounds per day for 2 to 3 
weeks under favorable conditions. Average 
sugar concentrations are 7–48 %. Pollen proteins 
at 10% are below minimum honey bee nutritional 
needs (20%), so other flowers mentioned in this 
book should be made available.

R E C OMME NDE D VA R IE T IE S

Numerous regionally adapted buckwheat 

varieties are widely available for seed produc-
tion. Consider hardiness and pest resistance 
when choosing varieties for seed production — 
although buckwheat cover crops are regularly 
planted without specified variety. For nectar pro-
duction, avoid shatter-resistant cultivars.

92. CLOVER

(Trifolium spp.)

C ONS I DE R E D T H E MO S T important group of honey plants 

in North America, clovers produce nectar yielding large 

quantities of light mild honey with enormous commercial appeal. 
All are important fodder plants, green manures, and cover crops, 
and clovers also fix nitrogen. For the greatest pollinator benefit, 
plant a variety of species: all are high-value bee plants. Clovers are 
mostly intolerant of acidic soils or drought, and dry weather can 
reduce nectar flow. Practically all are great pollinator plants; best 
location can vary among species. Many species reportedly produce 
more than 200 pounds of surplus honey under optimal conditions. 
Average nectar sugar concentration reported is 22–55% and pollen 
protein levels are high (>25%), depending on species and location.

Numerous species and varieties of clover are cultivated, and most are prolific in 

nectar production, but a few are considered weedy. White Dutch clover (Trifolium 
repens) is a low-growing ground cover that tolerates mowing and is beneficial for 
lawns and orchards. Crimson clover (T. incarnatum) is a beautiful red-flowered 
annual often planted as a cover crop. Alsike clover (T. hybridum) is an 
excellent perennial honey plant that grows vigorously in cool climates 
and tolerates wetter, more acidic soils than other clover species. Red 
clover (Trifolium pratense) is a short-lived perennial with deep 
nectaries that are often difficult for short-tongued bees to reach, 
but fine for bumble bees.

C OW P E A I S T H E catchall name for several subspecies of 

bean including the Chinese yard-long bean, the familiar 

black-eyed pea, and several others. Most of these subspecies 
(and their cultivars) produce exceptionally long bean pods and, 
depending on the variety, may be grown for human consumption, 
for livestock fodder, or as a green manure crop to improve soil 
fertility. Some shade tolerance allows cowpeas to be planted 
between other, taller row crops and as an understory plant in 
multilevel farm systems. This latter use is common in the tropics 
where cowpea is farmed beneath tropical fruit trees. Cowpea is 
considered a valuable honey plant in some regions, such as India 
and parts of Africa, producing a dark, mild-flavored honey.

MUSTARD

V A LUA B L E C OV E R , F OR AGE , row, and specialty crops, 

mustards suppress pests and weeds and help to control 

erosion. Most species are annuals or biennials that attract a variety 
of bee species. In some areas many mustards are considered weedy 
or noxious, while some attract crop pests such as stinkbugs (many 
genera) and tarnished plant bugs (Lygus lineolaris). Mustards 
are sometimes planted as a low-cost cover crop for honey bees, 
an increasing practice near California’s almond orchards. Due to 
high moisture requirements, they are generally low-quality honey 
plants with strong-flavored honey that crystallizes quickly and is 
difficult to extract. Reported average nectar sugar concentrations 
are 50–51%, and the pollen is high in fat (5%) and protein (25%).

of wingless wasp). Because partridge pea is an annual species, 
it does not grow well in areas already dominated by perennial 
vegetation. It works best on bare ground or in the early stages 
of prairie restoration, where it disappears after several seasons. 
Partridge pea grows well in burned and disturbed sites and provides 
food and shelter for gamebirds, songbirds, and deer throughout 
central, eastern, and southern North America.

are an excellent cover crop for building soil tilth. Spring 

planting will Typically produce flowers by summer or fall, while fall 
planting usually means plants bloom the following year (biennial 
lifecycle). Radishes can often become weedy, so you may not want 
to grow them as a cover crop unless you can tolerate their ongoing 
persistence, or unless you plan to cultivate the planting area fully to 
remove seedlings. If you grow radishes in your vegetable garden, let

SAINFOIN

(Onobrychis viciifolia)

A FA MOUS HON E Y plant in its native France, sainfoin is 

the source of the celebrated honey of the Gâtinais region. 
As recently as the 1950s this nonnative legume was an important 
fodder and cover crop in North America and was more widely 
cultivated in some locations than alfalfa or clover. Though it resists 
pests and tolerates drought, it will not survive competition with 
weeds and so should be cultivated in well-drained, nonacidic 
soils, in cleaned, firm, and uniform seedbeds with sainfoin-
specific Rhizobium inoculant. Similar to alfalfa but less hardy and

productive, sainfoin is preferred by 
foraging livestock and wildlife, 
and it reduces bloat and nematode 
parasitism in ruminant guts. The 
name literally means “healthy hay.”

Managers of dry western rangelands 
are increasingly recognizing sainfoin as a 
valuable honey plant. The sugar concentra-
tion of its nectar is reported as high as 60%, 
with enhanced flows in fertile soils. Sainfoin blooms early in the 
season for nearly two weeks and attracts ten times more bees than 
white clover does. The honey is yellow-white, quick to granulate, 
and less sweet than other honeys. Researchers have documented 
sainfoin honey yields of up to 350 pounds per acre.

Seed is often expensive, but once established, 

perennial stands can be long-lived. Many region-

regions, however, the Xerces Society does not recommend planting 
it in or around natural areas. For example, sweetclover is perhaps 
now the most invasive weed found along rivers in Alaska, where it 
crowds out native vegetation. In the Dakota Badlands, ecologists 
are concerned about how sweetclover is triggering the invasion 
of other nonnative plants, which more quickly establish on low-
fertility soils after colonization by this nitrogen-fixing legume.

Nectar flows are best on dry soils and yield a white or greenish 

yellow honey flavored with hint of vanilla or cinnamon. An aver-
age of 200 pounds of surplus honey per hive is not unusual, with 
reported average sugar concentrations of 48–52%.

100.VETCH

D OM E S T ICAT E D N E A R T H E dawn of the agricultural 

revolution, vetches are grown across the Northern 

Hemisphere as valuable cover, fodder, and forage crops and green 
manures. Closely related to lentils and peas, they reduce erosion 
and enhance organic and no-till farming through rapid growth 
and nitrogen fixation. Recent research shows that vetch can also 
remove pollutants from soils and may be used for phytoremediation. 
Both native and nonnative vetches can grow aggressively and may 
become weedy or invasive in certain habitats and under particular 
growing conditions. Although occasionally mentioned as honey 
plants, yielding a mild white honey, some vetches have such deep 
flowers they are probably inaccessible to honey bees.
