Introduction:  
What Is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the science of how things around us interact. The natural laws 

that govern atoms, elements, and compounds are amazing. There are 92 
natural elements. But from all these elements spring millions of compounds. 
For example, both diamonds and graphite (pencil lead) are pure carbon, but 
you can’t do your homework with a diamond.

The heart of chemistry—the atom—is simple and, at the same time, complex. 

The easiest way to understand the atom is to think of the three basic parts that 
make up an atom:  the proton, the neutron, and the electron. How those three 
parts combine and interact governs our world. Protons define what an atom is. 
Neutrons are the glue that holds atoms together. And the tiny electron is respon-
sible for how molecules are formed, and it helps your hair stand on end with static 
electricity. And these subatomic particles are made up of even smaller parts, called 
quarks. However, this book will go no smaller than the three basic parts. But in 
the future, you may be the person who leads us into even smaller worlds.

Science doesn’t have to be expensive, but it should always be fun. The junk 
drawer is a great place to start learning about science. You might have to visit 
the kitchen or your bathroom for a few additional items, but most of the stuff 
needed for this book is already in your house. Turn all those things you have 
collected over the years into fun science experiments.

As a friend of mine says, “Safety is your number one priority.” Read all 
the steps before proceeding. Get adult help when needed. Wear old clothes, 
tie up your hair, and wear sneakers when doing most of these experiments. All 
of these experiments are safe without safety goggles, but goggles do make you 
look more like a scientist. 

Now it’s time to learn about chemistry as you raid the junk drawer and all 

sorts of places around your house.

Properties of 

Matter

Matter is the stuff that makes everything around us. Everything you have 

touched, eaten, or played with in your life is probably composed of only 
30 different elements. Elements are the basic building blocks of matter. We 
can put those elements together in so many different ways. Think of the plastic 
building blocks you probably played with as a kid. By putting them together in 
different ways you can create almost anything you desire. The simplest part of 
an element is the atom (more on the atom in chapter 2).

Let’s jump in and learn some science about the world around us.

Can Can Dance
Watch two cans dance and learn about density.

From the Junk Drawer:
  Large sink (or glass aquarium, 
swimming pool, picnic cooler,  
or 2 large jars)

  Can of regular soda
  Can of diet soda

step 1:  Fill a large container with at least 8 inches of water. A kitchen sink is 
perfect. You can also use an aquarium (without fish in it), swimming pool, 
picnic cooler, or two large jars. Put an unopened can of diet soda and an 
unopened can of regular soda in the water. Observe what happens.

step 2:  Push the floating can under the water and observe. Share this 

experiment with your friends at your next party.

The Science Behind It
Objects float because of density. Density is mass divided by volume. Some-
thing with tightly packed atoms, like most metals, will have a high density. 
Loosely packed atoms, like the helium gas in a balloon, have a lower density. 
The easiest way to compare density is with water.

Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm3; a cm3 is also 

called a milliliter). If an object floats, it has a density less than 1 gram per cubic 
centimeter. If it sinks, the density is greater than 1 gram per cubic centimeter. 
The diet soda has an overall density less than 1 gram per cubic centimeter, so it 
floats. Regular soda has a density greater than 1 gram per cubic centimeter, so 
it sinks.

What is the difference between the two sodas? Sugar (in all its forms) 

increases the density of the regular soda. Diet soda is sweetened with a chem-
ical, and it only takes a tiny amount to create the same sweetness that sugar 
creates. Therefore, there is more matter in a can of regular soda than in a diet 
soda, making it denser.

In a swimming pool, you can change your body’s density by breathing. You 
decrease your overall volume when you breathe out. Your density increases to 
more than 1 gram per cubic centimeter. You sink, but you will swim up pretty 
quickly because you need air. For more on floating, you can go to the chapter 
on solutions (page 85).

Air Is Heavy
Use two balloons to learn one of the secrets of matter.

From the Junk Drawer:
  2 balloons
  3 pieces of string, each about 6 inches long
  Clear tape
  Ruler
  Pin or sharp scissors

step 1:  Blow up two balloons to equal size and tie a knot in the neck of each 

balloon. Tie a string around each knot.

step 2:  Use tape to secure the string from each balloon to opposite ends  

of a ruler.

step 3:  Tie another length of string around the center of the ruler. Hang the 
center string from the edge of a table using tape. (You can actually hang it 
from anything as long as it hangs freely.) Slide the ruler through the center

  string until it balances level. This is difficult and will take some practice. It 

does not have to be perfectly level, but it should be close.

step 4:  Take a pin or a pair of sharp scissors and create a tiny hole near the 

neck of one of the balloons. The rubber is thicker near the neck so the 
balloon won’t pop, but the air will slowly leak out. Observe what happens 
as one balloon deflates. Why do you think that happened?

The Science Behind It
Air is matter, and all matter has weight. As you saw from this experiment, a 
balloon full of air has more weight than an empty balloon. Blow up a balloon, 
tie it off, and let it go. It always falls because air, and the rubber balloon itself, 
both have weight. Balloons only float if they are filled with a lighter-than-air 
gas such as helium.

Three Balloons of Fun
Learn the secret to the states of matter with three balloons.

From the Junk Drawer:
  3 balloons of equal size
  Water

  Freezer

step 1:  Fill one balloon with air and tie a knot in it. Fill two more balloons 

with water and tie the balloons off. Try to make all the balloons close  
to the same size. Put one of the water-filled balloons in the freezer 
overnight (or for at least six hours). You want the freezer balloon to be 
completely frozen.

step 2:  A day later, take all three balloons outside. Squeeze each with your 

hands. What do you observe?

step 3:  Drop each balloon from about 1 foot above the ground. What do you 

observe?

step 4:  Now throw them away from you as high as possible. What happens?

step 5:  If any of the balloons haven’t popped, pop them now and observe 

what happens. How is the material in each balloon different?

The Science Behind It
All matter is composed of one of four states: solid, liquid, gas, or plasma. The 
gas balloon, filled with air, was almost impossible to pop by throwing or drop-
ping. That is because of the wonders of a gas. Gases are lightweight, so this was 
the lightest balloon. Gases can also change shape and volume. For that reason, 
the balloon was squishy. That is the reason this balloon was the hardest to pop. 
When you popped the gas balloon, the gas immediately started spreading out 
and mixing with the other gases in the air around it. In summary, gases are 
lightweight and able to take any shape and volume.

The liquid-filled balloon popped more easily because liquids are heavier, 
but they still move. The liquid also was squishy, but it never changed its vol-
ume. When the liquid-filled balloon popped, the liquid came out and stayed 
flat on the ground. The liquid changed shape, but the volume stayed the same. 
In summary, liquids are heavier than gases and have a definite volume, but will 
take any shape possible.

The solid balloon was the heaviest. The solid-filled balloon was also diffi-
cult to break. The solid ice inside kept the same shape and volume all the time. 
In summary, solids are heavier and keep the same shape and volume. Your 
solid chunk of ice may break into pieces when you drop it or throw it. If it 
didn’t already break the balloon, you can change its shape with a hammer. Go 
ahead—try it!

The fourth state of matter, plasma, is like a gas, but it has an electric 

charge. A fluorescent lightbulb is filled with a plasma. It is a gas that conducts 
electricity. Since it conducts electricity, it will create light when an electric 
charge is placed across it. The sun is a giant ball of plasma. To create a plasma 
it takes extreme heat, like the sun, or high amounts of electricity, like a plasma 
ball or a fluorescent lightbulb.

Homemade Stress Balls
Make super squishy fun balls with a few balloons.
Adult supervision required

From the Junk Drawer:
  Empty plastic drink bottle
  Serrated knife
  Oven mitt (recommended)
  Scissors

  4 balloons of equal size
  Rice, flour, or salt
  Spoon or fork

step 1:  With adult permission or help, use a serrated knife to cut a slit in the 
side of an empty plastic drink bottle. For safety purposes, you could use an 
oven mitt to hold the bottle. You just need to puncture an opening in the 
bottle—you will use scissors to finish it.

step 2:  Insert scissors into the opening and continue to cut around the bottle. 

This is a great way to create a homemade, wide-mouth funnel for any 
experiment.

step 3:  Blow up a balloon and allow it to deflate. Do this again several times. 
This stretches out the balloon and makes it easier to fill later. Stretch the 
neck of the balloon over the top of the bottle. When you turn it upside 
down, the balloon should hang freely.

step 4:  To avoid making a mess, go outside to fill the balloon. Fill your 

funnel with rice. Flour or salt also works well. Shake the funnel to allow 
the rice to fall into the balloon. You can put your hand over the top to 
prevent the rice from shaking out the top of the funnel.

step 5:  Use the handle of a spoon or fork to push even more rice down into 

the balloon. Fill the balloon until you have a small round ball.

step 6:  Remove the balloon from the funnel. Use your hands to massage the 
ball to get all of the rice into the body of the balloon and to get rid of as 
much air as possible. Tie a knot in the balloon close to the body. Now go 
back inside to finish the rest.

step 7:  Use scissors to cut the part of the balloon beyond the knot. Cut very 

close to the knot without cutting the knot.

step 8:  Cut the neck off two other balloons.

step 9:  With both hands, stretch out the body of one of the balloons. Have a 
friend or parent push the rice-filled ball into the stretched-out balloon. Put 
the knot in first to prevent any mess. Repeat with the other cut balloon. 
You should end up with a three-layer stress ball that won’t leak.

step 10:  Any good Stress Ball needs a stripe. Choose a contrasting color 

balloon and cut off the neck and the top.

step 11:  Stretch the stripe around the center of the ball. Make sure it covers 

the opening from step 9.

step 12:  Grab the ball and give it a good squeeze. Create three stress balls 

and teach yourself to juggle.

The Science Behind It
The rice (or whatever you used) acts like a very thick fluid. It moves and flows, 
just very slowly. The rubber from the balloons keeps the “liquid” inside. Since it 
acts like a liquid, the balls don’t bounce very well. But they are fun to play with.

Non-Newtonian Goo
Make a mess and learn about non-Newtonian fluids at the same time.

step 1:  Empty an entire 16-ounce box of cornstarch into the mixing bowl. 

Cornstarch is very inexpensive, and this experiment might be the most fun 
you will ever have with a dollar. This experiment is best done outside on a 
picnic table, for easy cleanup. If you do it inside, you might want to put the 
bowl on a large cookie sheet. 

step 2:  Slowly add water. Mix it with your hands. Of course, you can use 

a spoon, but hands are so much more fun. Add more water in small 
quantities until the mixture flows slowly, like a superthick liquid. Stop and 
play with it periodically; you can always add more water. You can add food 
coloring if you want to.

after you lift it?

step 4:  Make a fist and punch it into the mixture. What happens?

step 5:  Now sink your finger into it slowly. Why do you think it behaves  

that way?

7/22/15   6:37 PM

20 

Junk Drawer Chemistry

step 6:  Pour it from hand to hand. It will flow just like a liquid if you do  

it slowly.

step 7:  After you are done playing with the goo, go outside if you haven’t 

already. Roll a handful of goo into a ball and try to bounce it on the 
sidewalk. With the right consistency, you can actually get it to bounce 
once. Of course, it will ooze into a liquid again after the first bounce. Clean 
up when you are done and share the joy of Non-Newtonian Goo with 
friends and family. This is a great experiment to do at an outside summer 
picnic. Dilute the mixture heavily with water as you pour it down your sink 
if you are inside; if you don’t, you could end up with a plugged drain.

optional step 8:  If you buy about 20 boxes of cornstarch, you can create 

enough of the cornstarch mixture that you can dance on it in bare feet. You 
would need a large tub, like a storage tub (not a bathtub), to do this. As 
long as you move your feet quickly, you can dance on it. Stop, and you sink.

The Science Behind It
Viscosity is the term used for friction between molecules of a liquid. Water has 
a low viscosity and flows easily. Heat it up and it flows more easily. Honey has 
a lot of viscosity if it is cold. But if you warm up honey, it will pour almost like 
water. These are called Newtonian fluids because Isaac Newton did a lot  
of research on viscosity. He found that the viscosity of most liquids depends 
on their temperature. The hotter the liquid, the less viscosity, so it flows  
more easily.

The cornstarch goo you created is a non-Newtonian fluid. The goo’s vis-
cosity increases in response to the force you apply to it or the speed at which 
an object moves through it. Punch it and you get high viscosity. Ketchup and 
Silly Putty are other examples of non-Newtonian fluids. Ketchup’s viscosity 
decreases when you apply pressure to it. If you shake up the bottle, the ketchup 
will pour more easily.

Electric Water

step 1:  Turn on a water faucet and adjust the flow until the stream is 

extremely thin. An interesting thing happens with water streams. When 
you look at a water stream with your eye, you see a solid stream most of  
the way down, but you can see it breaking into drops at the end. With a 
high-speed camera, you can actually see the drops appear at a much higher 
level. Use your parents’ camera or a really good cell phone camera and 
prove it to yourself.

step 2:  Blow up a balloon and tie a knot in it. Now rub the balloon 

vigorously on your hair. You can also rub the balloon with any thick 
material, like a sock or a sweater. The fuzzier the better.

step 3:  Bring the balloon close to the stream of water. Keep moving it closer 

until you see the stream curve.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
All items start out neutral. That means they have an equal number of positive 
charges (protons) and negative charges (electrons). Since electrons are on the 
outside of the atoms, they can be transferred between objects through contact. 
As a matter of fact, the electrons are the only part that can be transferred, since 
the protons are tightly held in the nucleus (center) of the atom.

When you rub the balloon on your hair, you are adding electrons from 

your hair. Electrons are the tiny negative particles that exist on the outside of 
an atom. The balloon gains electrons and becomes negatively charged on the 
side that was rubbed on your hair. Your hair becomes positive. Since it lost 
negative charges, it now has extra positive charges. If you look in a mirror, you 
will see that a few hairs will stretch out to touch the balloon as you hold it 
close after rubbing your hair. That is because positive charges are attracted to 
negative charges (and vice versa).

The stream of water bends toward the balloon because of water’s polar 
nature. Water is composed of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) 
atom; the molecule looks like Mickey Mouse’s head. The two H atoms are 
small and form its ears, but the H atoms are also positive. The larger O atom 
forms the head and is negative. The overall water molecule is neutral but the 
bottom end is negative and the top (ear) end is positive.

The stream of water bends toward the balloon because the positive side of 
the water molecule is attracted to the negative side of the balloon. If you had a 
positively charged object near the stream of water, the water would also curve. 
It would curve because the other side of the Mickey Mouse head would be 
attracted to the positive object.

step 3:  Now try to blow up the balloon inside the bottle. Try harder, but don’t 

get too upset and don’t hurt yourself trying. The title of the experiment 
says it all: you can’t blow up the balloon inside the bottle!

The Science Behind It
An empty bottle isn’t really empty. It is full of air, and air takes up space. As 
you blow into the balloon, the air inside the bottle (but outside the balloon) is 
compressed and the balloon inflates slightly. But the air has no place to go, so 
the balloon will quickly stop inflating. The air inside the balloon has greater 
than normal air pressure from your lungs. The stronger your lungs are, the more 
the balloon will inflate, but it will never inflate completely.

To inflate the balloon in the bottle, try the next experiment.

The Impossible-to-Deflate Balloon
Learn more about air pressure as you create a balloon that won’t deflate.

From the Junk Drawer:

  Thumbtack or pushpin

step 1:  Use a thumbtack or pushpin to poke a hole in the bottom of the 
plastic bottle. Wiggle the tack or pin around to make the hole larger.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

step 2:  Now blow up the balloon inside the bottle. It may take several 

breaths, but it will now inflate inside the bottle. (A larger thumbtack hole 
allows the balloon to inflate faster.) It probably will not completely fill the 
bottle. It will only inflate until the balloon securely touches the inside wall 
all the way around the balloon.

step 3:  Once the balloon is inflated, with your mouth still on the neck of the 

balloon, use your finger to cover the hole in the bottle tightly. You could 
also use a small piece of tape to block the hole. Keep the hole blocked as 
you remove your mouth. The balloon will stay inflated as long as the hole  
is plugged.

step 4:  Unplug the hole and watch the balloon deflate. You can repeat 

the experiment as many times as you want. If you plug the hole before 
you attempt to blow up the balloon, you will get the same result as the 
Impossible-to-Blow-Up Balloon.

   

The Science Behind It
The thumbtack hole gives the air in the bottle a way to escape. As the balloon 
inflates inside the bottle, the air in the bottle escapes out through the hole. 
Some air will probably be trapped near the mouth end of the bottle, but your 
lungs should be able to create enough air pressure to completely inflate the 
balloon inside the bottle.

As you blow up the balloon, the extra air pressure from your lungs causes 
the balloon to expand. When you plug the hole with the balloon inflated and 
remove your mouth, the trapped air pressure inside the balloon and inside 
the bottle (but outside the balloon) will be equal. You can actually inflate the 
balloon and keep it the same size at any time just by plugging the hole. Try 
it. Blow the balloon halfway up and plug the hole. Remove your mouth and 
watch the balloon. It will stay the same size.

Air always flows from high pressure to low pressure. If the pressure is the 
same, the air won’t move significantly. It will move randomly back and forth 
through the opening to the balloon, but not enough will move to make the 
balloon change shape. That molecules of matter always move is one of the fun-
damental assumptions of science.

Pure gold is so soft you can bend it with your hand. Gold used  
in jewelry has had other metals added to it to make it stronger.

step 2:  Take a piece of facial tissue and fold it up until it fits inside the bowl. 
Gently lay a new paper clip on top of the tissue. Keep the tissue as flat as 
possible as you gently lay it on top of the water. Watch for a minute as the 
tissue paper absorbs water and sinks. The steel paper clip is now floating on 
the water. You can try it with larger paper clips, but it probably won’t work. 
The small paper clips always work.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
Water has surface tension because it is a polar molecule. Polar molecules have a 
positive end and a negative end. Since opposites attract, the positive ends stick 
to the negative ends and create a tough “skin” for the water. The tough skin is 
actually pretty strong—strong enough to support a steel paper clip if condi-
tions are right.

It is important that the steel paper clip lies flat on the water. If you 

dropped it or if it goes in at an angle, the surface tension “skin” is not strong 
enough to help it float. As the tissue dissolves, the weight of the paper clip 
is spread out and the surface tension helps the steel paper clip float. It is this 
surface tension that allows some types of bugs to walk on top of water. But the 
insects have to be light. Big bugs would sink just like big paper clips sink.

Super Wet Penny
How wet can a penny get?

From the Junk Drawer:
  Penny
  Medicine dropper
  Water

step 1:  Lay a dry penny on a smooth, waterproof surface. Use a medicine 

dropper to add 10 drops of water to the surface of the penny. If you don’t 
have a medicine dropper (or eye dropper), ask your parents if they have  
one in the medicine cabinet. Many children’s medicines come with them. 
A baby syringe will also work and comes with many medicines. You can 
also use an empty bottle from eye drops or contact lens solution if you can 
rinse it and refill it with water. In a pinch, you can even use a straw. To use 
a straw, put the straw down in water and put your thumb over the end of 
the straw. When you lift the straw it will pick up water due to air pressure. 
By quickly removing and replacing your thumb, you can let out tiny 
amounts of water. However, the other methods are easier to control.

step 2:  Continue adding drops of water, one at a time, to the penny. Stop 

after about fifteen drops and look carefully at the water on the penny. Put 
your eye down at the level of the penny and you will see a water “bubble.” 
Count the number of drops you can add until the water finally leaks off 
onto the surface. Does the number surprise you?

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
The number of drops you can put on a penny is amazingly large, if you are gen-
tle. You have probably already guessed that surface tension is the cause of this 
phenomenon. And you are right. The penny also has a ridge around the edge 
from where it was stamped at the mint. The edge makes a great container for 
your water “bubble.”

Gallium is a silver metal with a unique property: 

it will melt in your hand. It is a solid at room temperature.  

But its melting point is 85.6 degrees, so it melts when

step 1:  Fill a bowl with water. Sprinkle pepper across the top of the bowl. 

(This is a perfect use for the little paper pepper packets you get from 
restaurants, but a pepper shaker will also work.)

step 2:  Dip a toothpick through the surface of the water to the bottom of the 

bowl. What do you observe?

Junk Drawer Chemistry

step 3:  Pull the toothpick out of the water. Now dip one end of the 

toothpick into some liquid soap. Put the soapy end of the toothpick into 
the water and watch what happens.

The Science Behind It
The pepper flakes will float on top of the water. Pepper is hydrophobic, mean-
ing pepper is not attracted to water. Pepper, unlike salt, will never dissolve in 
water. The pepper floats on the “skin” of the water created by surface tension. 
Although the clean toothpick penetrates the water, it doesn’t change the sur-
face tension except right at the insertion point.

Since soap is a surfactant (short for surface acting agent), it decreases the 
surface tension. The soap enters from the toothpick point and quickly disrupts 
the surface tension. The water molecules try to keep the surface tension and 
run away from the soap. The floating pepper shows the water molecules run-
ning away from the soap.

Soap helps us clean by allowing water to lose some surface tension. That 
allows grease and oil, which make us dirty, to move more freely in the water. 
Molecules in the soap are designed to “suck up” the grease and oil. As you rinse

off, the soap carries away the grease and oil, along with any dirt trapped in the 
grease and oil.

39

The Science Behind It
The secret here is Charles’s Law. Charles’s Law says that volume and tem-
perature are directly related. When temperature goes up, volume goes up. And 
when temperature goes down, volume goes down.

When the candle is burning, the hot gas above it expands. As you place 

the jar over the top of the candle, the oxygen in the jar will allow the candle to 
burn for a few seconds. After the candle goes out, the gas in the jar will rapidly 
cool down. As the gas cools down, the volume of gas goes down and the water 
rises. If the candle is floating, it will levitate with the water surface.

step 3:  Turn the shiny side up and wipe it clean of any crumbs or oil. Using a 
large marker, draw a face on your bag. The face needs to cover most of the 
bag. Smiley faces are easy to draw, but be creative.

step 4:  Place the bag (shiny side up) on a microwaveable plate and place it in 
the microwave oven. Microwave on high for five seconds only. Do NOT 
microwave longer. Watch it through the door of the microwave oven 
while you are doing it. You will see a spectacular light show, but it does not 
hurt the microwave oven. Let the Shrunken Head cool for at least two 
minutes before touching it.

step 5:  Repeat for the other half of the bag. Try a different picture or just 

write your name on the bag in large letters.

The Science Behind It
The bags are composed of polymers, which are long chain molecules. In the 
process of making the bag, putting chips in it, and sealing it, the polymers are 
straightened out. The polymers’ natural shapes are bent and curled. When you 
microwave the bags, the polymers heat up and go back to their natural state, 
and the bag shrinks, along with anything you have drawn on it.

The light show you witnessed is created by the thin aluminum coating 
used in the bags. The microwaves cause electrons in the foil to move quickly 
back and forth. The electrons pile up on the sharp points of the bag. The air 
around the points becomes electrically charged and the electrons leave the bag 
as a spark. The sparks are small but noticeable. This is completely safe as long as 
it is done for only a short time and you have nothing that can catch fire inside 
the microwave, like a paper towel or paper plate.

The Science Behind It
My best friend, Matt, has entertained my daughters for years with this trick 
every time we have gone out to eat. It is a perfect way to entertain your family 
as you wait for food.

Paper is made of very tiny wood fibers. When you scrunch it up, these 
fibers compress. As the water soaks into the paper straw wrapper, the paper 
swells and the tiny fibers straighten out. Your Wrapper Snake grows as this 
happens. Let’s use the same process to make a dancing snake.

Frogs don’t need to drink water. They can absorb it right through their skin.

with where to put the water and how much to use. Share the Snake-
Charmed Dancing Wrapper with your family and friends the next time 
you go out to eat.

The Science Behind It
In many countries, snake charmers get snakes to dance with rhythmic music 
and movement. You get to use chemistry to make your wrapper dance. The 
fibers of the paper are twisted up by you. As water is absorbed into the wrap-
per, the fibers want to straighten out like they were before. Since they are 
twisted, they untwist as they straighten. This untwisting action causes the 
Snake-Charmed Dancing Wrapper to dance on your tabletop.

Atoms, Compounds, 
Elements, and the 

Periodic Table

The heart of chemistry is the atom. Atoms make up the elements that gov-

ern the world around us. Atoms are tiny. We will never see inside one, but 

we can still understand how they work. How they work and how they com-
bine affects everything—food, clothing, and toys . . . even how we breathe and 
digest.

You will learn a little about how scientists can observe things they can’t see. 
You will also see how scientists created the roster of elements that chemists call 
the periodic table. You will even learn how atoms can combine to form new 
compounds. A compound is just a combination of atoms, like water, which is 
a combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom—two gases that 
combine to form that fabulous liquid that keeps us alive.
Now it’s your turn to experiment and study the atom.

Black Box
Use a marble to learn how scientists model an atom that is too small to see.

From the Junk Drawer:
  Various small shapes like blocks, 

paper clip boxes, plastic thumbtack 
boxes, etc.

  Large piece of plain paper  

(or newspaper)

  Shoe box lid
  Friend, sibling, or parent
  Marble
  Pen, pencil, or marker

step 1:  You are going to discover how to create a model of something you 
can’t see, so a partner is a must for this experiment. If you construct it, 
you will know the secret, so close your eyes or leave the room while your 
partner places a single object on top of the large piece of paper. Tall objects 
work best, since you want the edges of the box lid to be suspended above 
the paper. In class, I use large paper clip boxes, but blocks of wood also 
work well. Large tuna fish cans work well for round objects. This is also a 
great use for repurposing old newspaper. If you draw on it with a marker, 
the marks will be visible even with the printing on the paper. In class, we 
always use newspaper, since it is free and easy to recycle. The photos below 
were taken with four pieces of plain white paper taped together to make 
the steps easier to see.

step 2:  Have your partner place the shoe box lid over the top so you can’t see 

the object. Now you can open your eyes or come back into the room.

step 3:  Roll the marble under the shoe box lid. Roll it hard enough that it 

comes back out, either after bouncing off the shape or after rolling straight 
through. Flicking it with your finger usually works well. Be careful to look 
straight down at the top of the shoe box lid. The goal is to create a model 
of something you can’t see—no peeking.

step 4:  Using a marker, pen, or pencil, draw an arrow to show the incoming 

direction and the outgoing direction of the marble on the paper 
underneath the mystery shape. You may want to use letters or numbers to 
keep track of which rolls go together. Repeat multiple times from different 
locations and angles. Mark each trial on the same piece of paper. If the 
object is small, you will have multiple straight lines and that is OK. It 
helps you determine the size of the unknown shape.

step 5:  Slowly slide the piece of paper out without looking under the shoe 

box lid.

step 6:  It will be easier if you connect the traces that went straight through 

under the shoe box lid. This will allow you to know the overall size.  
From the traces on your paper, draw what you think the hidden object 
looks like.

step 7:  Remove the shoe box lid and check your model against the actual 

shape. You will get better with practice.

step 8:  Repeat with a partner for other shapes. Take turns being the hider 

and the scientist. Once you are fairly good at determining individual 
shapes, try putting several shapes together to create funky shapes. (For 
teachers, you can set up multiple shapes at different lab stations and have 
each group replace the paper before they rotate to a new station. But most 
students will want to peek.)

The Science Behind It
More than almost any science, chemistry uses models of things that can’t be 
seen. You will never see inside an atom, only a model of what scientists think it 
looks like. You have just created a model of something you can’t see, just like a 
chemist would.

New Zealand’s Ernest Rutherford used almost the exact same process to 
create his model of the atom in the early 1900s. He shot alpha particles—large 
positive pieces—at a very thin piece of gold foil. Most went straight through. 
Some were bent a little bit. But some turned around and came back. Since 
like charges repel, he deduced that the atoms of gold had very tiny, extremely 
strong centers. His early model was called the Rutherford Planetary Model. 
Today we call this extremely tiny positive center the nucleus. We have adapted 
the model over the years as our science technology has gotten better.

Candy Atoms
Make atom models from junk drawer items, or make them good enough to eat. 
Edible Candy Atoms are more tasty.

From the Junk Drawer:
  3 different objects, like pushpins, 

paper clips, and safety pins, or three 
different coins

  For an edible atom, use 3 different 

 

types of candy, like Butterscotches,  
Peppermints, and Root Beer Barrels

  2 pieces of paper
  Pen

step 1:  Separate your items into three piles. One pile represents protons, 
which are positive and reside in the center of the nucleus. Another pile 
represents neutrons, which are neutral and also reside in the center of the 
nucleus. The last pile represents electrons, which are negative and orbit 
around the nucleus.  On one piece of paper, write down which objects 
represent which parts. Shown are several options for your atom parts. You 
just need three different types of subatomic particles. For candy, color is 
a great way to separate the three parts of the atom. (In class, I usually use 
colored candies like Skittles, M&M’S, or Gummy Bears, but they don’t 
photograph well in black and white.)

step 2:  Draw a small circle at the center of a sheet of paper. This circle will 

represent the nucleus of an atom. Draw two larger circles around the 
nucleus as shown.

step 3:  Place one proton in the center circle. Place one electron on the 
innermost of the larger circles. You have just created a model of the 
hydrogen atom. Hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the universe. 
The simplest form of hydrogen does not have any neutrons.

step 4:  Add a neutron to the nucleus of your hydrogen atom. You have 

created another form of hydrogen. Hydrogen always has just one proton. 
By varying the number of neutrons, however, you can create isotopes of 
hydrogen.

step 5:  Now for another atom. Place two protons and two neutrons in the 

center of the sheet. Place two electrons on the first (innermost) large circle. 
You have just created a model of helium. You could add more neutrons, but 
having two protons always means you have a helium atom.

step 6:  You can continue and make all of the atoms that exist in nature. You 

would have to have a lot of candy, since the largest natural atom has 92 
protons, 92 electrons, and more than 100 neutrons! Perhaps you should 
build a smaller one. Place seven protons and seven neutrons in the center. 
(You may need to stack them up.) Place seven electrons on the outside, 
following one more rule:  only two electrons can go on the innermost large 
circle. Put the next five on the outermost circle. You have just created a 
model of nitrogen, the most abundant gas in the air. We breathe nitrogen in 
and out all the time, as it makes up about 80 percent of the air around us.

step 7:  Now take a look at how atoms become electrically charged. All atoms 

start neutral, which means they start with the same number of protons 
and electrons. Take a look at the nitrogen model you just created. Remove 
two electrons. Count the number of protons (positive) and the number 
of electrons (negative). Which number wins? Since you have two extra 
positives, the resulting nitrogen ion has a positive-two charge.

step 8:  Now add back the two electrons to re-create your original nitrogen 

model. Now add one extra electron. Count the number of protons 
(positive) and the number of electrons (negative) again. Which number 
wins? Since you now have one extra electron (negative), the resulting 
nitrogen ion has a negative-one charge.

step 9:  Use a computer or science book to find a copy of the periodic table and 
build a larger atom. You are limited by the number of protons you have. And 
remember that the first level can contain only two electrons. The second level 
can contain only eight electrons. Don’t worry about how many electrons to 
put in the other outer circles. Just add whatever you decide to the next level. 
You will learn more about that in future science classes. The atom pictured 
below is number 12. Use the periodic table to find element number 12. That 
element is contained in anything that is alive or has ever lived.

The Science Behind It
You have just learned how to build the Rutherford-Bohr Planetary Model. 
Rutherford came up with the concept of the nucleus, and Danish scientist  
Niels Bohr discovered that electrons orbit at different distances from the 
nucleus. Scientists have further revised the model over the years and are still 
revising it today.

A toms, Compounds, elements, and the Periodic table 

63

The periodic table is like a roster for a sports game. It tells you what each 
element is based on the number of protons. Atoms of the same element always 
have the same number of protons. For example, all oxygen atoms contain eight 
protons. Nine protons and you have a different element. The number of neu-
trons can vary slightly. Oxygen normally has eight neutrons, but is sometimes 
found in nature with seven neutrons and sometimes with ten neutrons. But as 
long as there are eight protons, you have oxygen.

Losing or gaining electrons is common and creates an ion. An ion is sim-
ply an electrically charged atom. If an atom gains electrons, the ion created 
becomes negative, since the electrons are negative. If an atom loses electrons, it 
will create a positive ion, since it will have extra protons.

Positive and negative ions will join together to form compounds. Remem-

ber that unlike charges attract, so positive ions stick to negative ions. Table  
salt is a great example of this. Sodium atoms lose an electron and become  
positive. The chlorine atom gains the electron that sodium lost and becomes 
negative. The sodium ion and the chlorine ion then join together and create a 
really strong chemical bond.

All atoms start neutral, but luckily they don’t stay that way. Trading and 

sharing electrons allows all sorts of compounds to be formed. All candies prob-
ably contain only ten or fewer elements, but they can combine in a multitude 
of tasty ways.

step 1:  Take a look at the contents of your junk drawer. It could be a family 
junk drawer or maybe the junk drawer in your bedroom. Some people use a 
sock drawer (or a drawer in a jewelry box) in their bedroom as a junk drawer.

step 2:  Take the contents out, look at the stuff you have, and decide how to 
separate it. Put things that go together in piles. Be creative, but understand 
why you put things together.

step 3:  For a normal family junk drawer, you may end up with several 

common piles. One pile could be writing tools, which would include pens, 
pencils, crayons, and so forth. Another pile might be things to hold stuff 
together, which could include tape, glue, thumbtacks, brads, and paper 
clips. You might also have a pile of tools, like scissors and screwdrivers, 
and a pile of paper stuff, like coupons and letters. Maybe you have a pile 
of coins, buttons, and other miscellaneous stuff. A bedroom junk drawer 
might have a pile of toys and a pile of other things. Take one pile and line 
the objects up in a column with the smallest at the top and the largest 
at the bottom. Repeat for the next pile, putting the column next to the 
column made from the first pile. You have created your own Junk Drawer 
Periodic Table.

step 4:  Now look at an actual periodic table from a book or online. The 

vertical columns are called families. Families have similar properties, just 
like your columns have similar properties. The bigger elements are near the 
bottom, just like in your Junk Drawer Periodic Table. When you are done, 
clean up and put stuff back into the junk drawer with some order. Your 
parents will be happy and you have learned something. You can repurpose 
some old disposable plastic or Styrofoam cups to help you out. After they 
are cleaned, use scissors to cut the cups down so the drawer will close.

The Science Behind It
A Russian science teacher, Dmitri Mendeleev, did almost the exact same thing 
in the 1860s. He took the 56 known elements and wrote down what was 
known about each element on index cards. He grouped his cards by similar 
properties and then created columns. Out of his research grew our modern day 
periodic table. He even predicted the properties of elements that weren’t dis-
covered until later. Today there are more than 110 known elements, and  
scientists still use Mendeleev’s structure for the table.

The Science Behind It
You probably already know that the formula for water is H2O. You probably 
also know that hydrogen and oxygen are gases. The experiment you just did 
was to separate water into oxygen and hydrogen gas. This process is called  
electrolysis. Anytime you use electricity to separate parts of a compound, the 
process is called electrolysis.

The baking soda served as an electrolyte to help the water conduct elec- 
tricity. Pure water doesn’t actually conduct electricity. But pure water is very 
hard to find since water dissolves so many things. As a matter of fact, water is 
called the universal solvent because it is so good at dissolving stuff.

If you looked closely, you saw more gas coming from one thumbtack point 

than the other. Look at the formula for water and you can figure out which 
gas is more plentiful in water. The reason electrolysis works is because a battery 
has a positive terminal and a negative terminal. Water also has a positive part 
(hydrogen) and a negative part (oxygen). It’s amazing that water is a liquid even 
though it is actually composed of two gases. Compounds like water often have 
very different properties than the elements (hydrogen and oxygen) that make 
them up.

Joseph Priestley is credited with “discovering” oxygen.  
He developed a chemical reaction that would yield pure 
oxygen. Oxygen is around us, as you know, but it makes up  

less than 20 percent of what we breathe. Priestley also 
invented soda water (carbonated water). Pharmacists in  
the United States started adding syrup to the soda water  

to create soft drinks like Coke and Pepsi.

Tape Repulsion

From the Junk Drawer:
  Clear plastic tape

step 1:  Tear off a piece of clear plastic tape approximately 12 inches long. 

Fold 1 inch over at the end to create a non-sticky handle. Press the sticky 
part down to a smooth surface such as a countertop, making sure to hang 
the handle you made off the edge of the countertop. Use your fingers to 
press down hard along the entire length of the sticky part. Note:  To make 
it easier to photograph, fancy patterned tape was used. Clear tape works 
just as well and is cheaper.

step 2:  Repeat step 1 with another 12-inch strip of tape.

step 3:  One at a time, pull each piece of tape off the countertop, using the 
handles. Hold only the handles, trying not to touch the sticky part of the 
tape. With one strip in each hand, position the non-sticky sides of the 
dangling pieces so that they face each other. Now slowly move the tape 
pieces toward one another and observe what happens. Why do you think 
they repel (push away from) each other?

Now create another strip with a handle. Place the sticky part of this tape 
directly on top of the first piece. Press firmly down the entire sticky length.

step 5:  Remove the top piece of tape by pulling on the handle. Remove the 

bottom piece with your other hand. Slowly bring the two pieces close 
together and observe what happens. Why do you think they now attract?

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
The science here is a result of the electric charges that make up atoms. Atoms 
have three parts. Protons are positive and exist in the center of the atom, the 
nucleus. Neutrons are neutral and act like glue to keep the nucleus together. 
Electrons are negative and orbit around the nucleus. The simplest way to  
think of an atom is in terms of the solar system. The nucleus is like the sun  
and the electrons are like planets. (In reality, it is more complicated, as you  
will learn later.)

There are several rules governing electric charges. First, all atoms start  
out neutral, but can lose or gain electrons. Only electrons can move, since  
they are on the outside of the atom. Second, like charges (such as two posi-
tives) repel and unlike charges (positive and negative) attract.

In steps 1 through 3, the strips of tape repelled each other. The strips had 
the exact same electrical charge. You can’t tell whether it is positive or negative, 
but since they repel, you can deduce that they are the same. When you pressed 
the tape down, you caused a charge to move from the countertop to the tape. 
The tape gained one type of charge and the table gained the other type.

It would be easy to say that electrons were the only thing transferred, but 
scientists think it might be more complicated than that. Studies have shown 
that entire groups of molecules can be pulled away, bringing with them extra 
negative or positive charges. Either way, the tape pieces repel one another.  
They have the same charge.

In steps 4 through 6, the tape pieces attracted. Therefore they have oppo-
site charges. One tape strip gained a charge from the other. One strip is posi-
tive and one strip is negative.

Atoms can become electrically charged by losing or gaining electrons. 

Charged atoms are called ions. And positive ions like to connect to negative 
ions. Positive ions and negative ions can form compounds because they are 
electrically attracted. Table salt is composed of a positive sodium ion and 
a negative chlorine ion. They stick together and form the crystals that you 
sprinkle on food.

step 2:  Stretch the balloon over the end of the faucet, turn the water on 
lightly, and partially fill the balloon with water. If you want to use the 
rainbow ice in a drink, you will want the rainbow ice balls to be small 
enough to fit in a glass. But you can make them any size you want. For an 
option, wrap a fabric tape measure around the biggest part of the balloon 
to measure the circumference and write down the measurement.

step 3:  When the balloon is big enough, turn the water off. To take the 
balloon off, pinch the top very tightly before you pull it off the faucet.  
Tie a knot in the balloon. Make more and experiment with different  
colors and combinations of colors in each balloon.

step 4:  Place the filled balloons inside the freezer in a plastic bowl for at least 

two hours.

step 5:  Take the balloons out of the freezer. If you measured the balloons’ 
circumferences with a tape measure before they froze, do it again. The 
balloons have grown because the ice expanded. Use scissors to cut the 
knots off the balloons. Each balloon will also usually have a small air 
pocket, so you can put the point of the scissors into the air pocket to cut 
the balloon. Use your fingers to peel the rest of the balloon off and throw 
away the scraps. There is usually some food coloring left on the inside of 
the balloon, so do this over a sink or bowl. Rinsing the Rainbow Ice in 
water will remove the extra food coloring. It might stain your fingers a bit, 
but it will wash off with a little scrubbing.

step 6:  Place a few rainbow ice balls in a clear glass or bowl to admire them. 

Rainbow ice balls are perfect for parties. You can also skip the balloons  
and just add food coloring to each individual compartment of an old-
fashioned ice tray.

The Science Behind It
Water is a unique substance. Most substances get smaller as they cool down. But 
as water freezes, it actually gets bigger. That is the reason that a glass bottle full of 
water will break if put in the freezer. The water expands as it freezes and breaks the 
glass. Water freezing is very powerful and will even cause car engine blocks to crack 
in really cold environments if you don’t use antifreeze. In super cold environments 
(like northern Alaska), they make motors with a built-in electric heater that needs 
to be plugged in while the car or truck is parked in cold weather.

In this experiment you also get to play with food coloring. Food coloring 
is a safe type of dye. The colors mix in the same way as pigments in art class. 
Experiment to create your favorite color. And share your rainbow ice with 
friends. Make sure you use new balloons from a package if you are going to 
drink from the glass.

step 2:  Find two identically sized new balloons. Stretch one balloon with 

your hands four or five times. (More on why you do that later.) Blow up the 
balloon you just stretched. Let the air out. What did you observe as you blew 
up the balloon? When was the balloon hardest to blow up? Blow the same 
balloon up several times and let it deflate each time. Now lay the new balloon 
on the tabletop next to the deflated one you blew up several times. What do 
you notice about the two balloons? Why do you think that happened?

step 3:  Find an empty cereal box, file folder, or construction paper. Cut a 
1-inch-by-6-inch strip. Tape the strip end to end so it forms a circle, as 
shown. You might need to use your fingers to help it form a circle. Lay it 
down on the tabletop so that it looks like a circle when you look down at it.

step 4:  Now cut a 1-inch-by-10-inch strip and tape the ends together. Lay 
this circle around the smaller circle from the last step. Dump 50 to 100 
paper clips between the two circles. The number is not important, just 
make sure you use the same quantity for step 5 and step 7. Use your fingers 
to spread the paper clips evenly around the inside circle. Instead of paper 
clips, you can use candies like M&M’S or Skittles. Marbles or BBs also 
work great and you don’t have to use your fingers, because they roll. (Note 
to teachers:  I use BBs when I do this in class, but not every kid has BBs 
anymore.) The paper clips represent rubber molecules and the two circles 
represent the inner and outer surface of the balloon. Look at how many 
paper clips are touching other paper clips—they are stacked on top of each 
other. Each paper clip would tug on several other paper clips if they were 
rubber molecules.

i-xii_1-210_2b_Junk_Drawer_3rdpgs.indd   81

7/22/15   6:38 PM

82 

Junk Drawer Chemistry

step 5:  Now cut another strip, 1 inch by 14 inches. Use tape to secure the 
ends and stand it up just like in the previous two steps. Take the larger 
circle from step 4—this will represent the inside of the balloon—and 
place it inside the new, larger ring. Take all of the paper clips (or candies, 
marbles, etc.) from the small “balloon” circle in step 5 and put them in the 
larger “balloon” circle. Use your fingers to spread them out again. The paper 
clips still represent the number of rubber molecules in the balloon. Look 
at how many paper clips are touching other paper clips now. Make a new 
hypothesis. Why is there less “tug” as the balloon increases in size?

The Science Behind It
All elastic compounds can be stretched. And after they are stretched, their 
molecules tug each other and they try to go back to their original shape. Rub-
ber balloons and rubber bands do this, but so does the elastic in your socks and 
underwear.

83

When you first pick up a new balloon, the rubber molecules are very close 
together. That means they are touching thousands of other rubber molecules. 
Remember, molecules are incredibly tiny. When you stretch the balloon with 
your hands, you are stretching the rubber molecules a little. Some rubber mol-
ecules will stay stretched out a tiny bit. Stretching the balloon lessens the force 
required from your lungs a tiny bit. When you looked at the balloons in step 2, 
the stretched one was larger. The larger one is easier to blow up. Always stretch 
your balloons a few times before you blow them up.

Any balloon has a fixed number of molecules, and that number is way 

more than the number of “rubber molecules” you used—a greater number of 
rubber molecules than you could ever count. When you first blow up a balloon, 
even if you stretched it, the molecules are very tightly packed. Your lungs have 
to work extra hard to get the balloon started. And after the balloon starts to 
inflate, the number of molecules is still the same. But since the walls of the 
balloon get thinner, each rubber molecule has fewer other molecules to tug on. 
It is easier to blow up the balloon as it gets bigger. There is still a limit to how 
big the balloon can get. Keep blowing and the rubber molecules will tear away 
from each other and you will hear a loud pop.

Latex balloons come from rubber trees. The rubber  
tree’s bark is cut and the latex is caught in a cup.  

Harvesting the latex doesn’t hurt the tree. A rubber tree  

can produce latex for 40 years.

Solutions

Solutions are liquids that have other elements or compounds dissolved 

in them. From iced tea to milk to shampoo, solutions are all around us. 
Solutions have different densities and different properties, and they allow us 
to exist. Sometimes they combine, like mixing two flavors of soda at a soda 
fountain. But other times they don’t mix easily, like oil and vinegar in Italian 
dressing. Solutions can also make solids behave in strange ways.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
Solutions don’t always mix together, but in this case they can if you are not 
careful. The honey in this experiment has the greatest density, so it sinks to the 
bottom. The popcorn kernels have some water inside—that is what makes the 
kernel pop when heated—but the rest of the popcorn gives it a density greater 
than water. However, the kernels’ density is less than the honey. The kernels 
float in the middle of the solution. (Honey will dissolve in water if shaken or 
stirred; that is why you added the water very slowly.)

This same process is used for fluid-filled paperweights and magnets sold at 
many aquariums and science museums, but the manufacturers use liquids that 
will never dissolve in each other. The paperweights have a dolphin or a whale 
that always floats between two liquids. Objects in liquids float because of den-
sity. Ice floats in water because it has less density than water.

keep the stream of pouring water hitting the top of the egg as you pour.

you see? Why do you think that happened?

The Science Behind It
Objects float because of density, as you learned earlier. When you add salt to 
water, the salt actually “hides” inside the water. The saltwater is more dense 
because the mass is now much greater, but the volume is only a tiny bit larger. 
In the same way, you can float more easily in the saltwater ocean than in a 
freshwater swimming pool.

Since a raw egg is slightly more dense than regular water, it sinks below 

the regular water. But the raw egg’s density is less than the saltwater. Therefore 
the egg floats in the middle of the cup.

Fresh eggs sink and stale eggs float in regular water.  

Air actually passes right through the eggshell, just very slowly. 

An egg that completely floats in water should be discarded.

step 1:  Prepare a craft stick for the Sweet Crystals. Use a rubber band to 

attach the craft stick to the middle of a pencil as shown. You will probably 
have enough liquid for at least two Sweet Crystal sticks, so prepare at least 
two craft sticks. You can also use pipe cleaners or bamboo skewers instead 
of the sticks.

step 2:  Lay the pencil across the top of an empty jar. Adjust the stick so 

that it doesn’t touch the sides or the bottom of the jar. You want to have a 
1-inch clearance from the bottom.

step 3:  You will now need adult help to create the supersaturated solution that 
is the basis for this experiment. Add 1 cup of water to a saucepan on the stove.

step 4:  Add 3 cups of sugar and a few drops of food coloring to the water. 
Heat over medium heat while stirring with a spoon. For a flavored Sweet 
Crystal stick, you can add a few drops of a flavored extract from the spice 
cabinet in your kitchen. Be careful and don’t add much, as extracts are  
very strong.

step 5:  Keep a close eye on the saucepan and continue stirring the solution. 
As soon as it starts to boil, remove it from the heat. The liquid should be 
milky to almost clear.

step 7:  Dip the bottom 3 inches of the craft stick in the sugar solution. Put 

some sugar in a cup and push the wet part of the stick into the sugar. Turn it 
over to make sure both sides are covered. You may need to use your fingers 
to make sure all of the wet part of the stick is covered with sugar. The sugar 
crystals that stick will give the Sweet Crystals a place to start growing.

step 8:  Slide the craft stick back into the glass. Make sure the stick is not 

touching the sides or bottom.

step 9:  Put the Sweet Crystals glass in a safe, out-of-the-way place in the 
kitchen. Cover the top with a paper towel to keep dust out. Tear a small 
hole in the paper towel to help keep the stick upright. It will take several 
days to grow your Sweet Crystals.

step 11:  On the second day, you want to move your solution to a clean jar. 
Remove the stick and set it off to the side. You may need a fork to break 
the crystal “skin” on the surface of the sugar solution. Use the fork to 
remove and discard as many crystals as possible.

step 12:  Pour the liquid into a clean jar. If you have a small kitchen strainer, 
use it to help catch any loose crystals as you pour the liquid into the new 
jar. Hang the stick back in the sugar solution to grow more crystals. Look 
at the first jar. Notice how crystals have grown on the sides and bottom. 
If you don’t switch to a clean jar, the entire jar will crystallize. The same 
process will happen in your refrigerator with jelly if it is left too long.

step 13:  On day three, pull the stick out and observe. How is the Sweet 

Crystals stick different from the day before? You can repeat step 12 and 
clean the jar again, but every second day is usually often enough. On the 
fifth day, you can take it out to drip dry if you are impatient. Just place it 
on a plate for an hour to dry before you start nibbling. You can also wait 
two more days and repeat step 12 again if you choose. Be careful that the 
stick doesn’t crystallize to the jar sides. Enjoy and remember to brush your 
teeth well when you finish eating your Sweet Crystals.

The Science Behind It
What you have created is called rock candy. By adding a large amount of sugar 
to the water, you are creating a saturated solution of sugar (and any flavoring or 
color you added). By doing it on the stovetop you can add more sugar because 
heat allows all solutions to dissolve more solute. Solute is the fancy name for a 
solid that you put inside a solution, like sugar in sweet tea. You have a solution 
that is packed with dissolved sugar.

As the water evaporates over the next few days, the sugar crystals will form 
on the stick. The shapes they form represent the shape of sugar crystals. The large 
crystals could be smashed into tiny crystals like those you buy from the grocery 
store. But the large crystals are neater to look at. And they taste good too.

101

The Science Behind It
The secret behind this experiment is the soap. The food coloring just floats on 
the milk until soap is added to the mix. Adding soap lowers the surface ten-
sion, which allows the food coloring to more easily flow around the surface 
of the milk. The soap also breaks the fat molecules in the milk apart. As the 
fat molecules break, the food coloring goes with them, and since the surface 
tension is lower, they float around. Breaking down fat and grease molecules is 
what allows soap to clean stuff.

Dynamite can be made from peanuts—stay away  

if you are allergic! Peanuts can be processed to create 
glycerin, one of the ingredients in dynamite. You can  
also create glycerin from almost any type of natural  

oil or animal fat.

The Science Behind It
All ink is composed of pigments. A pigment is a molecule that absorbs  
particular colors of light and reflects the colors of light that we see. As you 
probably learned in art class, the three primary color pigments are yellow, cyan 
(a shade of blue), and magenta (a shade of red). These are also the three color 
cartridges needed for a color printer. Every color can be made from these three 
pigment colors.

Black is a combination of pigment colors. Alcohol wicks up the paper 
towel into the black marker line you drew. The pigment molecules will then 
be carried up the paper towel. The lighter, smaller, and more soluble molecules 
travel farthest up the paper strip. You get to see what pigment colors make  
up your black marker (or whatever color you used). This process is called  
chromatography.

Although oxygen gas is colorless, both the liquid and  

solid form are blue.

The Science Behind It
The ink used in washable markers dissolves in water, which is why they are 
washable. Water dissolves the ink and your clothes come clean. In this experi-
ment, you used water to separate the pigments in the water soluble ink. (For a 
permanent marker, as in the previous experiment, you need alcohol to separate 
the pigment colors.) The water wicks up the chalk. As the water rises up the 
chalk, it separates the pigments by their size and their solubility. The smaller, 
more soluble pigments rise up the chalk the farthest. The chalk absorbs the 
water and allows it to rise up. The color will only penetrate the outside layers 
of the chalk. Your chalk will still show mostly the inside color when you write 
with it. But the chalk looks neater in the box.

step 1:  Unscrew the top of a small LED flashlight. Look carefully at the 

flashlight head. All flashlight bulb assemblies will have two metal pieces. 
One is at the end of the bulb assembly opposite the bulb. The other metal 
piece will be on the side behind the bulb. The batteries and the housing

step 2:  Push the two batteries together, facing the same direction, and use a 
strip of electrical tape to hold them together. A helpful hint:  use scissors 
to cut a piece of tape about 4 inches long before you attempt to tape the  
batteries together.

step 3:  Hold the head assembly and the batteries together and use another 

4-inch strip of electrical tape to keep them together. The head assembly and 
the batteries should be tight and stay together. Retape if they aren’t tight.

step 4:  Cut two 4-inch-by-1-inch strips of aluminum foil. Fold each of the 
pieces four times, hot dog style, to make them stronger. Press the strips flat

step 5:  Attach one end of the first strip to the metal side of the flashlight 
assembly using electrical tape. The aluminum strip should be tight, but 
hang freely so that it can be bent to fit into your cup. You can use copper 
wire instead of the aluminum foil if you have any.

it tight. You can test your connection by touching the two aluminum strips 
together. The light should come on if your connections are tight. Repair 
any connections if the light doesn’t come on.

step 7:  Fill a cup about three-fourths full with water. Add at least two big 

spoonfuls of salt to your cup of water and stir.

salt water. What do you observe? Add two more spoonfuls of salt and try

drink (like Gatorade) if you have one.

The Science Behind It
Electrolytes are liquids that contain a substance that will split into a positive 
part and a negative part in water. Chemists call this ionizing a compound. 
Electricity is the flow of negative electrons. Since the compound is ionized it 
can conduct electricity.

Electrolytes are necessary for your body. Your brain tells your muscles to 
perform tasks by sending an electric impulse down your nerves to the appro-
priate muscles. Electrolytes are needed in your nerves to conduct this electric-
ity. As you sweat, you lose electrolytes. That is why sweat tastes salty. Sweat is 
actually saltwater. When exercising, you need to replace the electrolytes you 
sweat out. When you aren’t exercising, energy drinks are just empty calories.
The electrolyte conducts electricity and lights up the bulb in this tester.  

The number of ions in the solution determines how bright the light gets. A few 
ions and the light will hardly be visible. The more ions there are, the brighter 
the light. You could keep adding table salt to see how bright the bulb gets.

The Science Behind It
You probably already know that sodas are full of carbon dioxide. The carbon 
dioxide gives the soda the familiar fizz that we love. The carbon dioxide (gas) is 
actually dissolved in the soda. It can be dissolved in the soda because it is bot-
tled under pressure. When you open a soda, the gas will slowly escape, unless 
encouraged to escape faster.

In order for a bubble to form, it needs a nucleation point. That point can 
be an impurity in the bottle—another bubble or a salt (or sugar) crystal. The 
salt you added created hundreds of nucleation points at the same time, so it 
created hundreds of bubbles within seconds. This experiment is similar to the 
Diet Coke and Mentos experiment you may have seen before. The best part 
of My Soda Has Gas is that it allows you to see how much gas is dissolved in 
your soda. It is also a little less messy.

Reactions

Chemical reactions are at the heart of how different chemicals combine and 

how they split apart. Reactions allow atoms to rearrange themselves into 
new molecules. When chemical reactions occur, new chemicals are formed. 
Chemists call this a chemical change. Chemical changes are not reversible with-
out another chemical change.

Your senses will tell you when a chemical reaction takes place. You will 

smell a new odor. You will see a solid form from two liquids. You will see and 
hear bubbles being created as a gas is given off. You will see a color change. 
You may even feel heat or see light. All of these observations are evidence that 
a chemical reaction has taken place. Read on and you will learn how to make 
some safe chemical reactions.

from few inches onto the plate and watch it try to bounce. You should

can hang onto some nasty germs.

The Science Behind It
An eggshell is primarily calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. Calcium is 
the same element that gives you strong bones and teeth. Without calcium, you 
would be like the Rubber Egg.

The calcium reacts with the acetic acid (vinegar) to dissolve the shell. The 

white part of the egg becomes the new outside. The membrane of the egg 
holds the inside together. The membrane is flexible and will break if handled 
too roughly.

step 1:  You should do this experiment outside, because it will create a big, soapy 

mess. Stand an empty plastic bottle up in a baking pan with 2-inch sides  
(or similar aluminum pan). Add about ½ cup of hydrogen peroxide to the 
empty plastic bottle. A measuring cup makes it easier to pour into the bottle, 
but you could pour directly from the hydrogen peroxide bottle. You can use 
regular hydrogen peroxide from the medicine cabinet. It is most commonly 
sold as a 3 percent solution in almost every store. The reaction will happen 
faster (and look a little bit cooler) with 6 percent hydrogen peroxide (called 
20-volume hydrogen peroxide), which can be purchased in beauty supply stores.

step 6:  Enjoy the show as the Baby Elephant’s Toothpaste just keeps coming 
out of the bottle. Again, it happens faster with 6 percent solution, but the 
3 percent is just as much fun. The foam is safe to play with since it is just 
oxygen gas and soap. Since you added soap, cleaning up is easy.

The Science Behind It
Hydrogen peroxide is composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms 
bonded together. When it decomposes, it breaks down into water and oxygen 
gas. It will decompose when you pour it onto a surface, such as a cut on your 
arm. You will notice bubbles created on your cut after adding the hydrogen 
peroxide. The bubbles are oxygen gas, which helps to kill germs. The leftover 
water helps to rinse the cut, so hydrogen peroxide is great for treating minor 
cuts. Hydrogen peroxide will also decompose if exposed to light, so it is always 
sold in a dark-colored bottle. The decomposition is fairly slow.

Adding soap to the experiment allows you to more easily capture the oxy-
gen bubbles. The yeast acts as a catalyst. Catalysts speed up a chemical reaction. 
The yeast is a catalyst that causes bubbles of oxygen gas to form faster than 
they normally would. This experiment is called Baby Elephant’s Toothpaste 
because the foam squeezes out like toothpaste out of a tube. And it takes a lot 
of toothpaste to brush an elephant’s teeth.

step 2:  Let the pennies sit in the solution for 5 to 10 minutes. Observe what 

is happening as they sit in the solution. The longer they sit, the cleaner 
they get. After they are clean, remove the pennies from the solution. Rinse 
them with water and lay them on a paper towel to dry. Look at how shiny 
they are now.

step 3:  Rinse out the container with water. Add a few packets of soy sauce 
to the container and stir in a pinch of salt. Add a few dull pennies and 
let them sit for 10 minutes. Once the pennies have undergone a physical 
transformation, pull out the pennies and rinse them off. Compare these 
pennies to the vinegar pennies.

The Science Behind It
Pennies get dull because the copper on the outside (pennies aren’t copper on 
the inside anymore) reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide. Copper oxide is 
dull and sometimes even green.

The vinegar/salt solution dissolves the copper oxide off the outside of the 
penny, exposing shiny copper atoms. Vinegar is a very weak acid, which helps 
the reaction happen. Soy sauce is also a weak acid, so the same process hap-
pens. Cleaning pennies is a great use for those leftover packets of soy sauce 
that are in your kitchen junk drawer.

The only two metals that aren’t silver in  

color are gold and copper.

step 2:  After 10 minutes, remove the pennies. This time, do NOT rinse 

them. Just put them on a paper towel without drying them. Put the paper 
towel somewhere to watch what happens. Observe them periodically over 
the next few hours. Flip the pennies over after they are dry to see even 
more green.

The Science Behind It
Rinsing the pennies stops the chemical reaction and leaves you with shiny pen-
nies. They will form copper oxide on the outside again, but it will take months. 
Leaving the salt/vinegar solution on the pennies causes oxides to form on the 
outside. And it happens very fast.

The blue-green oxide formed on the outside is commonly called verdigris. 
It is a coating often found on metals. It is also formed in minerals that contain 
copper, giving many copper ores a blue-green color.

step 1:  Add ¼ cup of white vinegar to a clear container. A glass container 
will make it easier to see any evidence of the reaction, but plastic works 
too. Add a spoonful of salt and stir to help the salt dissolve.

step 2:  Slowly drop all of the dull pennies into the solution. Use only dull 

pennies, since the outside of them is coated with copper oxide. The copper 
oxide makes the pennies dull in color. Let them sit for 10 minutes and go 
on to the next step.

step 3:  Use steel wool or sandpaper to clean several iron nails. New nails 

from the store have a coating on them to prevent them from rusting. The 
steel wool will take off most of this coating. (The copper will only cover 
the areas where the coating is rubbed off.) Wipe them down or rinse them 
off after you finish cleaning them. You are cleaning them to make sure the 
outside is pure iron. Super silver shiny nails are galvanized with zinc and 
won’t work. Iron nails, when new, are shiny but aren’t bright silver in color.

step 5:  Place the clean nail (or nails) in the vinegar and salt solution. You 

can swirl the container around to speed things up. Leave the nails in for at

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
The acid solution (vinegar) dissolves the copper oxide off the outside of the  
pennies. The salt helps speed the process up. The copper atoms will stay in the 
vinegar and salt solution. As you saw earlier, the pennies will come clean after 
the copper oxide is removed. The copper ions are now positive (because they 
lost electrons). The copper ions are freely floating in the solution even after the 
pennies are removed.

The vinegar and salt solution will dissolve some of the iron on the surface 
of the nail, leaving the nail with a net negative charge. The positive copper ions 
attach more easily onto the negative nail than the iron ions that dissolved. The 
positive copper ions will coat the outside of the negative nail until the nail is 
neutral. You are left with a copper-coated nail.

The Science Behind It
The milk molecules combine with the phosphoric acid in the soda to create 
molecules that are denser than the regular soda molecules. The new heavier 
molecules then sink to the bottom. The rest of the liquids are less dense and 
stay near the top. Basically, you have just curdled the small amount of milk 
with the phosphoric acid in the soda. The curds sink to the bottom and take 
the color with them.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
A normal candle is composed of two parts: a wick and paraffin wax. The wick 
is an absorbent string. Paraffin wax is a compound made up of hydrogen and 
carbon, like gasoline for your car. When you light the wick, it melts the par-
affin wax near the flame. The wax, after it becomes a liquid, is drawn up the 
absorbent wick. The wax vapor is what burns. The candle is a simple combus-
tion reaction.

A combustion reaction happens anytime you burn a hydrocarbon, like 

gasoline or paraffin wax. As you probably already know, it takes oxygen gas to 
keep a fire burning. Some of the oxygen combines with the carbon to form 
carbon dioxide. Some of the oxygen also combines with the hydrogen to 
form water. All combustion reactions give off carbon dioxide and water vapor 
(steam). Other products may also be given off, depending on the purity of the 
candle wax.

The Emergency Crayon Candle works almost exactly the same way. The 
wrapper of the crayon burns and vaporizes the wax of the crayon. The vapor-
ized wax contributes to the flame. The flame is larger because the wrapper is 
paper and paper burns more easily than the wick of a candle. It is important to 
do this experiment in a well-ventilated area because crayons also contain pig-
ments and other impurities, and the wrapper burns. Blow out the candle before 
it melts all the way down.

Candle clocks were a common way to keep time  

a thousand years ago. The candle burns at a regular rate  

so it can act as a crude clock.

Acids and Bases

Acids and bases are special compounds that control a good chunk of our 

life. Stomach acid helps you break down food for digestion. Acids can also 

taste good, like orange juice and sodas. Bases are used for cleaning, like soap 
and shampoo. Acids and bases are almost opposites of each other. Extra stom-
ach acid is neutralized by adding a base like Rolaids, Tums, or Pepto-Bismol. 
Strong acids and strong bases are both dangerous, but weak acids and bases are 
used every day. The experiments in this chapter will use some common weak 
acids and bases, but treat them carefully, for practice. Safety first—always.

step 1:  You need a safe, easy-to-clean outside area. A sidewalk or picnic table 
works well. (You could also do it inside a shower with parental permission.) 
You need a leak proof bag—the zippered style seals the best. A used 
sandwich bag is fine; just rinse it out and check for leaks. You can check for 
leaks by adding water and turning it upside down. Smaller snack-sized bags 
will also work, but you will just need to cut the amounts in steps 3 and 5 in 
half. Take four squares of toilet paper and double them over as shown. You 
will create a rectangle that is two squares long and two squares thick.

step 2:  Put two spoonfuls of baking soda in a line along the middle of the 

toilet paper rectangle.

The Science Behind It
Vinegar is a solution of acetic acid and water. Acetic acid is a weak acid  
compared to stomach acid or even lemon juice. Baking soda is the chemical 
sodium bicarbonate, and it is a weak base. Acids and bases neutralize each 
other by giving off water and a type of salt and sometimes other products. The 
term salt in chemistry is given to the leftover compound in any acid-base neu-
tralization reaction.

The other product in this reaction is carbon dioxide . . . and lots of it. As 
the carbon dioxide builds up in the bag, it creates more and more pressure. 
When the inside pressure exceeds the strength of the bag—POW!

Helium was discovered in the sun before it was found on 
Earth. It was actually named helium after the name for the 
Greek god of the sun, Helios. It was discovered during a solar 

eclipse in 1868, when two separate scientists detected a 
bright yellow spectral line while observing the edge of the 

sun. It wasn’t discovered on Earth until 1895.

step 11:  You will need an LED light to show off your battery. You can buy 

them, but there are other sources, like your junk drawer. Old toys that have 
an LED light will work. Or a string of LED holiday lights that is headed 
for the trash. When holiday lights go out, usually only one bulb is burned 
out, but the rest are good. (You can also test the LED with a normal 
battery to make sure the LED is good.) Almost all portable lights in 
devices today are LEDs. When you remove the light, keep as much wire as 
possible. You might want to get adult help to strip some of the insulation 
off the last ½ inch of each wire. Use scissors (or wire strippers) to lightly 
cut through the insulation only. Twist the wire as you lightly cut and then 
pull the plastic insulation off. Stripping wires takes practice, so don’t worry 
if it takes you a few tries. Slide each wire of the LED under the tape on 
each end of your battery. The LED should light. You can squeeze the wires 
onto the metals with your hands. The electric current is not strong enough 
to hurt you, and besides, it would rather go through the metal of the wires 
instead of your skin. If the LED doesn’t light, reverse the wires and try it 
again. Turn off the lights in the room to see the light better.

extensions:  Try adding more cells and the bulb will be brighter. You could 
also try using Gatorade instead of vinegar. Leave the light somewhere safe 
and see how long your battery lasts.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
Batteries are created using two different metals with an electrolyte between 
them. The metals for this experiment were zinc and copper. The electrolyte  
was the vinegar soaked into the cardboard. The stack with the cardboard 
between created a cell. The two metals are electrodes. The current will flow 
from the copper to the zinc. The electrons are free to move through the vinegar 
and create a current in the electrolyte (vinegar). All acids will act as electrolytes 
in water.

If you leave batteries in a toy for years, the battery acid will actually leak 
out and destroy your toy. You have probably seen the remnants of this acid 
electrolyte if you have opened an old toy with batteries in it.

When you connect the electrodes with any conductor (like the LED and 
wires) the current will flow through it. LEDs usually take about 1.5 volts to 
light up. Each cell creates about 0.6 volts. When you stack three cells up, you 
get 1.8 volts, and the LED will light. More voltage equals a brighter light, but 
three cells are required to see most LEDs. Experiment and try to create a super 
bright light from your own homemade battery.

The Science Behind It
When you mix baking soda and vinegar together a chemical reaction takes 
place. The bubbles show you that a gas is given off. Chemical reactions almost 
always create a gas, an odor, or a new color. The gas you created was carbon 
dioxide. Baking soda is a base, and vinegar is an acid. Whenever you mix an 
acid and a base together, you create carbon dioxide gas. An acid and a base 
mixing together is called a neutralization reaction.

Carbon dioxide is denser than air, so it will stay inside the measuring cup. 

When you tip the cup, the gas can pour out onto the candle flame. As you 
already know, fires need oxygen to burn. Since carbon dioxide is denser than 
normal air, it will flow to the bottom. With practice you can get the carbon 
dioxide to stay over the candle for a few seconds. The carbon dioxide blocks 
oxygen from getting to the candle flame, so the candle goes out. 

Bee stings are acidic and wasp stings are basic.

The Science Behind It
Most effervescent tablets contain dry citric acid, sodium bicarbonate (bak-
ing soda), and aspirin (another weak dry acid). The tablets also contain small 
amounts of a few other ingredients that will vary between manufacturers, but 
the citric acid and the baking soda do the fizzy work.

Acids can often be found in a dry condition. They don’t behave like acids 
until they are placed in water. When the dry citric acid dissolves in water, it 
behaves just like the vinegar in the previous experiment. The citric acid mixes 
with the baking soda to create even more water, sodium citrate, and carbon 
dioxide. The carbon dioxide blows up the balloon. The leftover sodium citrate 
is dissolved in the water. When you drink the sodium citrate solution, it helps 
neutralize excess stomach acid and you feel better. Sodium citrate is a weak 
base, so it can neutralize your stomach acid. The aspirin is also a weak acid 
called acetylsalicylic acid. The aspirin works as an analgesic to reduce pain to 
further help you feel better.

A gas being produced is a clear sign that a chemical reaction has taken 
place. Anytime you see bubbles being created, you are witnessing a chemical  
reaction. If you put hydrogen peroxide on a cut it bubbles. You are watching a 
chemical reaction. You cut into a birthday cake and see air pockets. These air 
pockets are bubbles that were baked into the cake as it underwent a chemical 
reaction in the baking process. Bubbles equal gas, and gas equals chemical reac-
tions. A neutralization reaction is just a special type of reaction between an acid 
and a base.

step 1:  Break an effervescent tablet into three equal-sized portions. Alka-

Seltzer is an example of an effervescent tablet, but any brand will do.

step 2:  Fill one cup with water and add an ice cube or two. Fill another cup 
with room temperature water and let it sit for a few minutes. Fill a third 
cup with the hottest water you can get from your faucet. Be careful not to 
burn yourself with the hot water. Put the three cups on a piece of scrap 
paper and label the cups hot, room temperature and cold.

step 3:  Drop your tablet pieces into each cup as quickly as possible. You can 

drop them simultaneously if you have a helper. Observe what happens. 
Which one fizzes the most? Which one fizzes the least? You can also 
observe which glass completes the fizzing first.

The Science Behind It
If you look at the ingredients on the box your tablet came in, you will see that 
the tablet contained the following ingredients: an acid (usually citric acid), 
sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and usually aspirin. There are also some 
other lesser ingredients. In tablet form, the acid and the base aren’t moving 
around enough to react. When the tablet is added to water, the acid and the 
base dissolve and react to form water, a type of salt, and carbon dioxide gas. 
The carbon dioxide accounts for the bubbles.

The faster the molecules are moving, the faster the reaction takes place. The 
hot water allows the reaction to occur faster. The hot water also allows the tab-
let to dissolve faster. Both reasons help the fizz occur quicker.

Chemist Joseph Priestley isolated a vegetable gum that would 

rub out pencil marks in 1770. Edward Naime, an English 

engineer, discovered rubber gum at the same time. The eraser 
was born! An eraser is stickier than the paper on which you’ve 

written. Bits of graphite that used to be on the paper would 
rather stick to the eraser. Before pencil erasers, people often 

used bread pieces to remove graphite.

Radioactivity and 
Thermodynamics

Radioactivity is the process of atoms changing into new atoms. Think of 

it like a seed growing into a flower. But radioactivity can be dangerous. 
This chapter contains a few simple and safe experiments to teach you about 
radioactivity.

This chapter also delves into the wonderful world of heat. Heat is the 
energy that results from molecules moving. And molecules never stop. They 
don’t take a lunch break, and they don’t sit and watch television. All they 
do is go, go, go. The moving molecules also provide options for a ton of fun 
experiments.

The Science Behind It
Nuclear fission is when a large, unstable atom splits into smaller atoms. When 
this happens, part of the energy holding the large nucleus together is given 
off as heat. This heat energy can be used to generate electricity. The heat boils 
water and creates steam, and the steam spins a generator to make electricity. 
Approximately 20 percent of the United States’ electricity is created using 
nuclear fission.

To start nuclear fission, nuclear engineers shoot a neutron into the large 
nucleus, which starts the chain reaction. In addition to the heat energy given 
off, the first atom splitting will release three more neutrons to split other 
atoms. The number of atoms split increases rapidly. The first split atom creates 
3 split atoms, then 9 atoms, then 27 atoms, and so on, and the number grows 
very fast. This is what you did in step 1.

The uncontrolled chain reaction of an atomic bomb creates an incredible 
amount of heat all at once. But inside a nuclear reactor, control rods capture 
some of the extra neutrons and “control” the reaction. By controlling the reac-
tion, the heat released is controlled to make electricity. This is what you did in 
step 2 with the pencil. The pencil acted as a control rod to stop emitted neu-
trons from splitting other atoms. To completely control the number of atoms 
split, you need multiple control rods, as in step 3. The paper clip boxes (or 
blocks) acted as control rods.

Fission reactors have to be carefully watched by trained engineers to  
keep them safe. A nuclear reactor is built with the control rods in place, to  
keep an uncontrolled chain reaction from occurring. To start the process,  
engineers slowly remove the control rods and a chain reaction begins giving  
off heat. If they want the chain reaction to stop, the rods are pushed all the  
way back in.

Fission reactors do have a major danger even if carefully monitored. The 
leftover smaller atoms are dangerous to be around. They emit dangerous invisi-
ble particles that can cause severe damage. The leftover atoms have to be stored 
safely from people for thousands of years. That is not easy. Think back to when 
you tried to hide something from someone else. It isn’t easy to find a safe hid-
ing place.

Candy Half-Life
Use candy to learn about radioactive atoms.

  M&M’S candy
  Paper towel 
  Paper

  Pencil
  Plastic cup

Note: You can also do this same experiment with pennies, but M&M’S  
taste better.

step 1:  This experiment can be done with any number of candies over 20. 
(You probably want to do this experiment on a paper towel to keep the 
candies clean . . . so you can eat them when you’re done.) Count the number 
of M&M’S you start with. Check that the candies actually have a letter on 
one side. Create a chart on your paper. Label one column Half-Life Shake 
and the other column Good Atoms. Under Half-Life Shake, write the 
numbers from 0 to 10. Under Good Atoms, the “undecayed” atoms, write 
the number of candies you’re starting with (see chart on next page).

step 3:  Gently smooth the candies out so they form a flat layer. Candies 

with the letter up are considered undecayed “good” atoms and should be 
pushed into a pile with other undecayed atoms. Dispose of—eat—all of 
the “decayed atoms,” the ones with the letters facing down.

step 4:  Count the number of undecayed atoms and write that number down 

next to Half-Life Shake 1 on your chart. Place all the undecayed atoms 
back in the cup.

177

step 5:  Shake the cup and repeat steps 3 and 4. Remember to record the 

number of undecayed atoms each time on your chart. Continue repeating 
steps 3 and 4 until all the undecayed atoms are gone. Add more Half-Life 
Shake candies if you need to.

The Science Behind It
Many large atoms are unstable. Unstable atoms are called radioactive atoms. 
These radioactive atoms will naturally give off a radioactive particle (either 
alpha, beta, or gamma). When they give off this particle, they become more 
stable. These radioactive particles are invisible and dangerous. Many of the 
large atoms, like uranium and plutonium, have radioactive isotopes. An isotope 
is a type of the element that has a different number of neutrons.

i-xii_1-210_2b_Junk_Drawer_3rdpgs.indd   177

178 

Junk Drawer Chemistry

Whether a radioactive atom gives off a particle is random, just like 

whether a candy lands letter side up or down when dropped. With each shake 
of the cup, about half of your candy atoms “decayed” into new atoms. In nature, 
these decayed atoms can be new elements. Radioactive uranium will eventually 
turn into lead, but it takes thousands of years. The time it takes half a sample to 
change is called half-life. Your half-life was each shake of the cup.

In real life, half-lives are different for each radioactive element. The half-
life of any radioactive material is measured by scientists and available in books 
and online. Uranium 235, used in many nuclear reactors, has a half-life of 700 
million years. Imagine waiting 700 million years between shakes of your cup. 
Radioactive iodine, used in medicine, has a half-life of only eight days.

Scientists create graphs out of charts like the one you created. You can 

create one of your data if you want. Scientists put atoms up the side and time 
in years across the bottom. Your graph would have the number of shakes across 
the bottom.

Marie Curie shared the Nobel Prize in 1903 with her husband, 

Pierre, and Henri Becquerel for her work with radioactivity, 

but she almost didn’t. The French Academy of Science 

nominated only Pierre and Henri to the Nobel committee. 
When Pierre found out, he insisted that she be added to the 
nomination. She was added, and the trio shared the prize.

step 1:  Put some ice and water in a bowl and make sure you have plenty 
of liquid. Invert a glass bottle in your hand and place the opening of the 
bottle in the bowl of ice water. With the other hand, place the coin in the 
cold water.

step 2:  After about a minute, place the bottle upright on a countertop. Place 

the wet coin over the opening on the top of the bottle.

step 3:  Wrap both of your hands around the bottle. Cover up as much of the 
bottle as possible. Observe what happens. Also listen for any sounds you 
hear. Keep your hands there and see how many times you can make the 
coin dance. 

extension:  Try using different coins. Have fun and share this experiment 
with others. You can also make the coin dance faster if you and a friend 
both wrap your hands around the bottle at the same time.

The Science Behind It
The experiment begins with a cold bottle filled with cold air. Your hands add 
heat to the bottle and warm up the air inside. Hot air expands. The water on 
the wet coin seals the top so the air cannot escape. As the air warms inside the 
bottle it tries to expand, and the pressure of the air increases. The pressure from 
the expanding air soon becomes large enough to cause the coin to “burp” out a 
little warm air.

You can also do this experiment without the ice; simply wet the coin and 
try the experiment again. The ice speeds up the process by cooling the air first. 
Since the air is cooler, heat is transferred faster and the coin dances quicker.

step 1:  Fill up an ice tray and put it in the freezer overnight. If you don’t have

so the water freezes completely. The next morning, add one drop of food 
coloring to a few of the ice cubes in the tray. Add seven or eight drops 
if you used a larger plastic container. Put the tray or container back in 
the freezer. Observe the ice each day for three days. Keep track of your 
observations each day. After the third day, pop the ice out of its container 
and look at all sides of the ice. What do you see? Where does the food 
coloring show up? Does that surprise you?

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
One of the fundamental theories of chemistry is the kinetic molecular theory. 
The theory says that molecules in all materials are always moving. They only 
completely stop at a theoretical temperature called absolute zero. Scientists have 
never gotten to this temperature. It is more than 450 degrees below zero on 
the Fahrenheit scale!

It is easy to observe the motion of a liquid and a gas. Gas molecules are 

free to fly around the room. Liquid molecules flow and take the shape of 
their container. This experiment allows you to see evidence of the solid mole-
cules moving. Molecules in a solid are allowed to wiggle, but they don’t travel 
around. The wiggling of the ice molecules allows the food coloring to move 
into the piece of ice. Touch a tabletop. The molecules are actually moving. But 
they are so tiny, when one molecule moves up, the molecule next to it is mov-
ing down. Our hand feels it as smooth even though the molecules are wiggling. 
Of course, the molecules in our fingertip are also wiggling.

The amount of movement is related to the type of material and tem-

perature. Water can be seen in all three common states all the time. Ice is the 
coldest, and its molecules move the least—they only wiggle. Liquid water is 
warmer and the molecules can slide. Steam is the hottest and the molecules 
zoom across the room.

step 1:  Pour some juice into a small zippered-style plastic bag with no leaks. 
A used sandwich bag is fine as long as it is rinsed out and does not leak. 
Hold it upright and squeeze out all the air as you zip it completely. Freezer 
bags are a good choice, if you have them, because they are thicker.

Junk Drawer Chemistry

The Science Behind It
The key to this experiment is adding the salt. Heat always flows from hot to 
cold. The ice is colder than the juice, so heat leaves the juice and starts to melt 
the ice. When you add salt to the ice, the freezing point of the ice water mix-
ture is lowered. Since the ice and saltwater mixture is now colder, even more 
heat leaves the juice. The water in the juice begins to freeze as it loses more 
heat. The frozen water molecules in the juice are what creates the Do-It-Your-
self Slushie.

Adding salt to ice is the same scientific process used when creating home-
made ice cream. Adding salt to water is also useful to help keep the roads from 
icing up on cold nights. The salt lowers the freezing point of water. The water 
on the road will not freeze until it reaches a colder temperature. This makes 
the streets safer to drive on. Adding salt to the ice also makes the juice in your 
slushie freeze more quickly.

The lighter was invented before the match.

step 1:  Pour a tiny bit of water into a thin plastic bottle (most water bottles 

today are made very thin to save money and plastic). You only need 
enough water to just barely cover the bottom. Swirl the water around.

step 2:  Read this entire step before you do it, because it contains two parts 
that must be done quickly. With adult supervision, light a match. Once it 
is burning well, drop it into the plastic bottle. The water will put the match 
out. Immediately cap the bottle so you capture the smoke.

step 3:  Squeeze the bottle as hard as you can. What happens? Now let go of 
the bottle and observe what happens. Repeat several times. When you are 
done, rinse out the bottle, dispose of the match, and recycle the bottle.

The Science Behind It
Water vapor is everywhere around us, but we can’t always see it. But we do see 
water vapor when it condenses and turns into liquid around dust particles in 
a cloud. Clouds are a mixture of dust particles and water vapor. The dust par-
ticles give the water vapor something to condense on when the temperature 
drops. Dust, water vapor, and a falling temperature are all you need.

The Cloud in a Bottle has all three things needed for a cloud. The water 
vapor comes from the water you added. The smoke from the burning match is 
like the dust particles. And you created the falling temperature by squeezing 
and releasing the bottle. When you squeeze the bottle, the pressure and tem-
perature increase. As you release the bottle, the pressure and temperature both 
fall. The falling temperature causes the water vapor to condense on the smoke 
particles and you have a Cloud in a Bottle.

step 2:  Place the plate inside the microwave oven and microwave on high for 

two minutes. You will do no harm to the soap, microwave, or plate. Depending 
on the power of your microwave, the soap should reach full size before two 
minutes. If you microwave it longer, it will probably begin to shrink.

step 3:  Use a hot pad to remove the plate from the microwave oven and 

inspect your Incredible Soap Monster. Let it cool for at least two minutes 
before you attempt to touch it. It is still regular soap and can still be used.

The Science Behind It
As it grows, the soap is undergoing a physical change, like breaking a piece of 
chalk. A physical change does not create anything new. A chemical change (like 
the ones you created in chapter 4) creates a new substance.

Two things happen to the soap bar in the microwave. One, the soap itself 
heats up and softens. And two, the tiny bubbles of air trapped inside the soap 
bar heat up. This causes water vapor in the bubbles to vaporize and expand. 
Since the bubbles grow, the Incredible Soap Monster grows as well. The soap 
hasn’t changed except in size, and it is a little more flakey. Use it in your next 
bath or shower and you will still come out as clean as ever.

The Science Behind It
At room temperature, the air pressure inside the can is equal to the air pressure 
outside the can, so the wall of the can is stationary. (Air pressure is the result of 
air molecules colliding with a surface.) Even as the can heats, the air pressure is 
equal, so the wall doesn’t move. As the can heats, the water you put in the can 
will turn into water vapor, which pushes the air molecules out of the can.

When you invert the can and dunk it into the ice water, there is a rapid 
change in pressure as the gaseous water vapor molecules turn back into a liq-
uid. The liquid water takes up much less room that the hot gaseous water vapor. 
The void created by the water vapor as it changes back into a liquid creates very 
low pressure inside the can. The air pressure outside is still normal air pres-
sure, much higher than the inside pressure. The outside air pressure wins and 
crushes the can inward. The outside air pressure also pushes water up into the 
can. Air pressure is powerful!

create a hole if you want to make a charm for a necklace. Make the hole 
before you bake your shrinky dink.

step 5:  You are now ready to create your masterpieces. For a fun option, 

rub your plastic back and forth on a concrete sidewalk. This scratches the 
plastic and makes it look like frosted glass. It will look great either way;  
the frosted look adds variety to your artwork.

step 6:  Use permanent markers to draw on the plastic. You can draw flowers, 
houses, or anything you want. Be creative and use lots of colors if you have 
them—the colors will stay when the plastic shrinks. You can also write 
your name, the name of your favorite book, or any saying you want.

step 7:  If your plastic container has a design stamped into the plastic, color 

the lines or the flat part of the design to create a really cool art project.

step 8:  With adult help, heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread a 
piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil on a cookie sheet. Lay all of 
your artwork on the cookie sheet. Do not put any plastics other than #6 in 
the oven, ever.

step 9:  Turn the light on in your oven so you can watch. Place the cookie 
sheet on the oven rack. The shrinking will start to take place within two 
minutes and will be done before five minutes is up.

step 10:  The plastic may curl up as it shrinks, and this is normal. If it curls 
too much, have an adult take it out of the oven and push it down with a 
metal pan. DO NOT touch the plastic, as it will be very hot for about 
two minutes. If the plastic is not done shrinking, put it back in the oven 
for a few more minutes. If a piece curls up and touches itself, it will melt 
together and you won’t be able to save it. It is always a good idea to make 
extras for this reason. Cup bottoms tend to curl up more than flat pieces.

step 11:  Pull the cookie sheet out of the oven using hot pads and let it cool 
off. Two or three minutes is enough for your Homemade Shrinky Dinks to 
cool off, but be careful—the cookie sheet will stay hot longer.

step 12:  Admire and show off your artwork. An unshrunk cup bottom is 
included in the picture to show you that the cup bottoms don’t shrink 
as much as thinner flat pieces, but they still look neat. The cup bottoms 
are thicker and only shrink to about half of their original diameter. The 
thinner flat pieces will shrink down to five or six times smaller.

The Science Behind It
Plastic #6 is called polystyrene. Raw polystyrene is heated, rolled flat, and cooled 
very quickly to form the plastic containers used for food. This leaves the poly-
styrene as a long, straight polymer. But polystyrene is actually a bunched up, 
curled polymer in its raw form. When you heat #6 plastic without rolling it flat, 
it changes back to its normal bunched-up polymer. And as this happens the 
long, straight polymers shrink to a smaller bunched-up polymer. Polystyrene is 
called a thermoreactive plastic because its properties can be changed by heat.
