Preface

In our world there is no form of matter more astonishing than the liv-
ing cell: tiny, fragile, marvelously intricate, continually made afresh, yet 
preserving  in  its  DNA  a  record  of  information  dating  back  more  than 
three  billion  years,  to  a  time  when  our  planet  had  barely  cooled  from 
the hot materials of the nascent solar system. Ceaselessly re-engineered 
and diversified by evolution, extraordinarily versatile and adaptable, the 
cell retains a complex core of self-replicating chemical machinery that is 
shared and endlessly repeated by every living organism on the face of the 
Earth—in every animal, every leaf, every bacterium in a piece of cheese, 
every yeast in a vat of wine.

Curiosity, if nothing else, should drive us to study cell biology; we need to 
understand cell biology to understand ourselves. But there are practical 
reasons, too, why cell biology should be a part of everyone’s education. 
We  are  made  of  cells,  we  feed  on  cells,  and  our  world  is  made  habit-
able by cells. The challenge for scientists is to deepen our knowledge of 
cells and find new ways to apply it. All of us, as citizens, need to know 
something  of  the  subject  to  grapple  with  the  modern  world,  from  our 
own  health  affairs  to  the  great  public  issues  of  environmental  change, 
biomedical technologies, agriculture, and epidemic disease.

Cell biology is a big subject, and it has links with almost every other branch 
of science. The study of cell biology therefore provides a great scientific 
education.  However,  as  the  science  advances,  it  becomes  increasingly 
easy to become lost in detail, distracted by an overload of information 
and technical terminology. In this book we therefore focus on providing 
a digestible, straightforward, and engaging account of only the essential 
principles. We seek to explain, in a way that can be understood even by 
a reader approaching biology for the first time, how the living cell works: 
to show how the molecules of the cell—especially the protein, DNA, and 
RNA molecules—cooperate to create this remarkable system that feeds, 
responds to stimuli, moves, grows, divides, and duplicates itself.

The  need  for  a  clear  account  of  the  essentials  of  cell  biology  became 
apparent to us while we were writing Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC), 
now in its fifth edition. MBoC is a large book aimed at advanced under-
graduates  and  graduate  students  specializing  in  the  life  sciences  or 
medicine. Many students and educated lay people who require an intro-
ductory  account  of  cell  biology  would  find  MBoC  too  detailed  for  their 
needs. Essential Cell Biology (ECB), in contrast, is designed to provide the 
fundamentals of cell biology that are required by anyone to understand 
both the biomedical and the broader biological issues that affect our lives.

This fourth edition has been extensively revised. We have brought every 
part  of  the  book  up  to  date,  with  new  material  on  regulatory  RNAs, 
induced  pluripotent  stem  cells,  cell  suicide  and  reprogramming,  the 
human  genome,  and  even  Neanderthal  DNA.  In  response  to  student 
feedback, we have improved our discussions of photosynthesis and DNA

repair. We have added many new figures and have updated our cover-
age  of  many  exciting  new  experimental  techniques—including  RNAi, 
optogenetics, the applications of new DNA sequencing technologies, and 
the use of mutant organisms to probe the defects underlying human dis-
ease. At the same time, our “How We Know” sections continue to present 
experimental  data  and  design,  illustrating  with  specific  examples  how 
biologists tackle important questions and how their experimental results 
shape future ideas.

As  before,  the  diagrams  in  ECB  emphasize  central  concepts  and  are 
stripped of unnecessary details. The key terms introduced in each chapter 
are highlighted when they first appear and are collected together at the 
end of the book in a large, illustrated glossary. 

A central feature of the book is the many questions that are presented in 
the text margins and at the end of each chapter. These are designed to 
provoke students to think carefully about what they have read, encourag-
ing them to pause and test their understanding. Many questions challenge 
the student to place the newly acquired information in a broader biologi-
cal context, and some have more than one valid answer. Others invite 
speculation. Answers to all the questions are given at the end of the book; 
in many cases these provide a commentary or an alternative perspective 
on material presented in the main text.

For those who want to develop their active grasp of cell biology further, 
we  recommend  Molecular  Biology  of  the  Cell,  Fifth  Edition:  A  Problems 
Approach, by John Wilson and Tim Hunt. Though written as a compan-
ion to MBoC, this book contains questions at all levels of difficulty and 
contains  a  goldmine  of  thought-provoking  problems  for  teachers  and 
students. We have drawn upon it for some of the questions in ECB, and 
we are very grateful to its authors.

The  explosion  of  new  imaging  and  computer  technologies  continues 
to  provide  fresh  and  spectacular  views  of  the  inner  workings  of  living 
cells. We have captured some of this excitement in the new Essential Cell 
Biology website, located at www.garlandscience.com/ECB4-students. This 
site, which is freely available to anyone in the world with an interest in 
cell biology, contains over 150 video clips, animations, molecular struc-
tures, and high-resolution micrographs—all designed to complement the 
material in individual book chapters. One cannot watch cells crawling, 
dividing,  segregating  their  chromosomes,  or  rearranging  their  surface 
without a sense of wonder at the molecular mechanisms that underlie 
these processes. For a vivid sense of the marvel that science reveals, it 
is hard to match the narrated movie of DNA replication. These resources 
have been carefully designed to make the learning of cell biology both 
easier and more rewarding.

Those who seek references for further reading will find them on the ECB 
student and instructor websites. But for the very latest reviews in the cur-
rent literature, we suggest the use of web-based search engines, such as 
PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) or Google Scholar (scholar.google.com).

As  with  MBoC,  each  chapter  of  ECB  is  the  product  of  a  communal 
effort, with individual drafts circulating from one author to another. In 
addition,  many  people  have  helped  us,  and  these  are  credited  in  the 
Acknowledgments  that  follow.  Despite  our  best  efforts,  it  is  inevitable 
that there will be errors in the book. We encourage readers who find them 
to  let  us  know  at  science@garland.com,  so  that  we  can  correct  these 
errors in the next printing.

We are very grateful, too, to the readers who alerted us 
to errors they had found in the previous edition. 

Many staff at Garland Science contributed to the crea-
tion of this book and made our work on it a pleasure. 
First of all, we owe a special debt to Michael Morales, 
our  editor,  who  coordinated  the  whole  enterprise.  He 
organized  the  initial  reviewing  and  the  focus  groups, 
worked  closely  with  the  authors  on  their  chapters, 
urged us on when we fell behind, and played a major 
part in the design, assembly, and production of Essential 
Cell  Biology  student  website.  Monica  Toledo  managed 
the  flow  of  chapters  through  the  book  development 
and  production  process,  and  oversaw  the  writing  of 
the  accompanying  question  bank.  Lamia  Harik  gave 
editorial  assistance.  Nigel  Orme  took  original  draw-
ings created by author Keith Roberts and redrew them 
on  a  computer,  or  occasionally  by  hand,  with  great 
skill  and  flair.  To  Matt  McClements  goes  the  credit  for 
the graphic design of the book and the creation of the 
chapter-opener  sculptures.  As  in  previous  editions, 
Emma Jeffcock did a brilliant job in laying out the whole 
book  and  meticulously  incorporating  our  endless  cor-
rections. Adam Sendroff and Lucy Brodie gathered user 
feedback  and  launched  the  book  into  the  wide  world. 
Denise Schanck, the Vice President of Garland Science, 
attended  all  of  our  writing  retreats  and  orchestrated 
everything with great taste and diplomacy. We give our 
thanks to everyone in this long list.

Last but not least, we are grateful, yet again, to our col-
leagues and our families for their unflagging tolerance 
and support.

but also to all other Garland Science textbooks. Qualified 
instructors can obtain access to the site from their sales 
representative or by emailing science@garland.com.

Art of Essential Cell Biology, Fourth edition
The images from the book are available in two conven-
ient  formats:  PowerPoint®  and  JPEG.  They  have  been 
optimized for display on a computer. Figures are search-
able by figure number, figure name, or by keywords used 
in the figure legend from the book.

Figure-Integrated Lecture outlines
The  section  headings,  concept  headings,  and  figures 
from  the  text  have  been  integrated  into  PowerPoint 
presentations. These will be useful for instructors who 
would like a head start creating lectures for their course. 
Like  all  of  our  PowerPoint  presentations,  the  lecture 
outlines  can  be  customized.  For  example,  the  content 
of these presentations can be combined with videos and 
questions from the book or “Question Bank,” in order to 
create unique lectures that facilitate interactive learning. 

Animations and Videos
The  130+  animations  and  videos  that  are  available  to 
students are also available on the Instructor’s Resource 
site  in  two  formats.  The  WMV-formatted  movies  are 
created  for  instructors  who  wish  to  use  the  movies  in 
PowerPoint presentations on Windows® computers; the 
QuickTime-formatted movies are for use in PowerPoint 
for  Apple  computers  or  Keynote®  presentations.  The 
movies  can  easily  be  downloaded  to  your  computer 
using the “download” button on the movie preview page.

Question Bank
Written  by  Linda  Huang,  University  of  Massachusetts, 
Boston,  and  Cheryl  D.  Vaughan,  Harvard  University 
Division  of  Continuing  Education,  the  revised  and 
expanded question bank includes a variety of question 
formats:  multiple  choice,  fill-in-the-blank,  true-false, 
matching,  essay,  and  challenging  “thought”  questions. 
There  are  approximately  60–70  questions  per  chapter, 
and  a  large  number  of  the  multiple-choice  questions 
will be suitable for use with personal response systems 
(that is, clickers). The Question Bank was created with 
the philosophy that a good exam should do much more 
than simply test students’ ability to memorize informa-
tion; it should require them to reflect upon and integrate 
information as a part of a sound understanding. It pro-
vides a comprehensive sampling of questions that can 
be used either directly or as inspiration for instructors to 
write their own test questions. 

references
Adapted  from  the  detailed  references  of  Molecular 
Biology  of  the  Cell,  and  organized  by  the  table  of  con-
tents for Essential Cell Biology, the “References” provide 
a rich compendium of journal and review articles for ref-
erence and reading assignments. The “References” PDF 
document is available on both the instructor and student 
websites.

Cells: The Fundamental Units 
of Life

What does it mean to be living? Petunias, people, and pond scum are all 
alive; stones, sand, and summer breezes are not. But what are the fun-
damental properties that characterize living things and distinguish them 
from nonliving matter?

The answer begins with a basic fact that is taken for granted now, but 
marked  a  revolution  in  thinking  when  first  established  175  years  ago. 
All  living  things  (or  organisms)  are  built  from  cells:  small,  membrane-
enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals 
and  endowed  with  the  extraordinary  ability  to  create  copies  of  them-
selves by growing and then dividing in two. The simplest forms of life are 
solitary cells. Higher organisms, including ourselves, are communities of 
cells derived by growth and division from a single founder cell. Every ani-
mal or plant is a vast colony of individual cells, each of which performs 
a specialized function that is regulated by intricate systems of cell-to-cell 
communication.

Cells, therefore, are the fundamental units of life. Thus it is to cell biol-
ogy—the study of cells and their structure, function, and behavior—that 
we must look for an answer to the question of what life is and how it 
works. With a deeper understanding of cells, we can begin to tackle the 
grand historical problems of life on Earth: its mysterious origins, its stun-
ning diversity produced by billions of years of evolution, and its invasion 
of every conceivable habitat. At the same time, cell biology can provide 
us with answers to the questions we have about ourselves: Where did we 
come from? How do we develop from a single fertilized egg cell? How is 
each of us similar to—yet different from—everyone else on Earth? Why do 
we get sick, grow old, and die?

2 

ChapTEr 1     cells: the Fundamental Units of Life

In this chapter, we begin by looking at the great variety of forms that cells 
can show, and we take a preliminary glimpse at the chemical machinery 
that all cells have in common. We then consider how cells are made vis-
ible under the microscope and what we see when we peer inside them. 
Finally, we discuss how we can exploit the similarities of living things to 
achieve a coherent understanding of all forms of life on Earth—from the 
tiniest bacterium to the mightiest oak. 

Unity and diversity of Cells
Cell  biologists  often  speak  of  “the  cell”  without  specifying  any  particu-
lar  cell.  But  cells  are  not  all  alike;  in  fact,  they  can  be  wildly  different. 
Biologists estimate that there may be up to 100 million distinct species 
of living things on our planet. Before delving deeper into cell biology, we 
must take stock: What does a bacterium have in common with a butter-
fly? What do the cells of a rose have in common with those of a dolphin? 
And in what ways do the plethora of cell types within an individual mul-
ticellular organism differ?

Cells vary enormously in appearance and function
Let us begin with size. A bacterial cell—say a Lactobacillus in a piece of 
cheese—is a few micrometers, or μm, in length. That’s about 25 times 
smaller than the width of a human hair. A frog egg—which is also a single 
cell—has a diameter of about 1 millimeter. If we scaled them up to make 
the Lactobacillus the size of a person, the frog egg would be half a mile 
high.
Cells vary just as widely in their shape (Figure 1–1). A typical nerve cell in 
your brain, for example, is enormously extended; it sends out its electrical 
signals along a fine protrusion that is 10,000 times longer than it is thick, 
and it receives signals from other nerve cells through a mass of shorter 
processes that sprout from its body like the branches of a tree (see Figure 
1–1A). A Paramecium in a drop of pond water is shaped like a submarine 
and is covered with thousands of cilia—hairlike extensions whose sinu-
ous  beating  sweeps  the  cell  forward,  rotating  as  it  goes  (Figure  1–1B).

as 100,000 other nerve cells. (B) Paramecium. this protozoan—a single giant cell—swims by means of the beating cilia that cover its 
surface. (c) Chlamydomonas. this type of single-celled green algae is found all over the world—in soil, fresh water, oceans, and even 
in the snow at the top of mountains. the cell makes its food like plants do—via photosynthesis—and it pulls itself through the water 
using its paired flagella to do the breaststroke. (D) Saccharomyces cerevisiae. this yeast cell, used in baking bread, reproduces itself 
by a process called budding. (e) Helicobacter pylori. this bacterium—a causative agent of stomach ulcers—uses a handful of whiplike 
flagella to propel itself through the stomach lining. (a, copyright herederos de Santiago ramón y cajal, 1899; B, courtesy of anne

by a rigid box of cellulose with an outer waterproof coating of wax. A 
neutrophil or a macrophage in the body of an animal, by contrast, crawls 
through tissues, constantly pouring itself into new shapes, as it searches 
for and engulfs debris, foreign microorganisms, and dead or dying cells. 
And so on.

Cells are also enormously diverse in their chemical requirements. Some 
require oxygen to live; for others this gas is deadly. Some cells consume 
little  more  than  air,  sunlight,  and  water  as  their  raw  materials;  others 
need a complex mixture of molecules produced by other cells. 

These differences in size, shape, and chemical requirements often reflect 
differences in cell function. Some cells are specialized factories for the 
production of particular substances, such as hormones, starch, fat, latex, 
or pigments. Others are engines, like muscle cells that burn fuel to do 
mechanical work. Still others are electricity generators, like the modified 
muscle cells in the electric eel. 

Some modifications specialize a cell so much that they spoil its chances 
of  leaving  any  descendants.  Such  specialization  would  be  senseless 
for a cell that lived a solitary life. In a multicellular organism, however, 
there is a division of labor among cells, allowing some cells to become 
specialized to an extreme degree for particular tasks and leaving them 
dependent on their fellow cells for many basic requirements. Even the 
most basic need of all, that of passing on the genetic instructions of the 
organism to the next generation, is delegated to specialists—the egg and 
the sperm.

living Cells all have a similar Basic Chemistry
Despite  the  extraordinary  diversity  of  plants  and  animals,  people  have 
recognized from time immemorial that these organisms have something 
in common, something that entitles them all to be called living things. 
But while it seemed easy enough to recognize life, it was remarkably dif-
ficult to say in what sense all living things were alike. Textbooks had to 
settle for defining life in abstract general terms related to growth, repro-
duction, and an ability to respond to the environment.

The discoveries of biochemists and molecular biologists have provided 
an elegant solution to this awkward situation. Although the cells of all 
living  things  are  infinitely  varied  when  viewed  from  the  outside,  they 
are fundamentally similar inside. We now know that cells resemble one 
another to an astonishing degree in the details of their chemistry. They are 
composed of the same sorts of molecules, which participate in the same 
types  of  chemical  reactions  (discussed  in  Chapter  2).  In  all  organisms, 
genetic information—in the form of genes—is carried in DNA molecules. 
This information is written in the same chemical code, constructed out 
of the same chemical building blocks, interpreted by essentially the same 
chemical machinery, and replicated in the same way when an organism 
reproduces. Thus, in every cell, the long DNA polymer chains are made 
from the same set of four monomers, called nucleotides, strung together 
in different sequences like the letters of an alphabet to convey informa-
tion.  In  every  cell,  the  information  encoded  in  the  DNA  is  read  out,  or 
transcribed, into a chemically related set of polymers called RNA. A sub-
set of these RNA molecules is in turn translated into yet another type of 
polymer  called  a  protein.  This  flow  of  information—from  DNA  to  RNA 
to protein—is so fundamental to life that it is referred to as the central 
dogma (Figure 1–2). 

The  appearance  and  behavior  of  a  cell  are  dictated  largely  by  its  
protein molecules, which serve as structural supports, chemical catalysts,

DNa (a gene) is transcribed into an rNa 
molecule, which can then be translated into 
the linear sequence of amino acids of a

molecular motors, and so on. Proteins are built from amino acids, and all 
organisms use the same set of 20 amino acids to make their proteins. 
But the amino acids are linked in different sequences, giving each type 
of protein molecule a different  three-dimensional shape, or conforma-
tion, just as different sequences of letters spell different words. In this 
way, the same basic biochemical machinery has served to generate the 
whole gamut of life on Earth (Figure 1–3). A more detailed discussion 
of the structure and function of proteins, RNA, and DNA is presented in 
Chapters 4 through 8.

If cells are the fundamental unit of living matter, then nothing less than 
a cell can truly be called living. Viruses, for example, are compact pack-
ages  of  genetic  information—in  the  form  of  DNA  or  RNA—encased  in 
protein  but  they  have  no  ability  to  reproduce  themselves  by  their  own 
efforts. Instead, they get themselves copied by parasitizing the reproduc-
tive machinery of the cells that they invade. Thus, viruses are chemical 
zombies: they are inert and inactive outside their host cells, but they can 
exert a malign control over a cell once they gain entry.

all present-day Cells have apparently evolved from the 
same ancestral Cell
A cell reproduces by replicating its DNA and then dividing in two, passing 
a copy of the genetic instructions encoded in its DNA to each of its daugh-
ter cells. That is why daughter cells resemble the parent cell. However, 
the copying is not always perfect, and the instructions are occasionally 
corrupted by mutations that change the DNA. For this reason, daughter 
cells do not always match the parent cell exactly. 

Mutations  can  create  offspring  that  are  changed  for  the  worse  (in  that 
they are less able to survive and reproduce), changed for the better (in 
that they are better able to survive and reproduce), or changed in a neutral 
way (in that they are genetically different but equally viable). The struggle 
for survival eliminates the first, favors the second, and tolerates the third. 
The genes of the next generation will be the genes of the survivors. 

On occasion, the pattern of descent may be complicated by sexual repro-
duction, in which two cells of the same species fuse, pooling their DNA. 
The genetic cards are then shuffled, re-dealt, and distributed in new com-
binations  to  the  next  generation,  to  be  tested  again  for  their  ability  to 
promote survival and reproduction. 

These simple principles of genetic change and selection, applied repeat-
edly  over  billions  of  cell  generations,  are  the  basis  of  evolution—the 
process by which living species become gradually modified and adapted 
to  their  environment  in  more  and  more  sophisticated  ways.  Evolution 
offers  a  startling  but  compelling  explanation  of  why  present-day  cells 
are so similar in their fundamentals: they have all inherited their genetic 
instructions  from  the  same  common  ancestor.  It  is  estimated  that  this 
ancestral cell existed between 3.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, and we must 

cells Under the Microscope

suppose that it contained a prototype of the universal machinery of all 
life on Earth today. Through a very long process of mutation and natural 
selection, the descendants of this ancestral cell have gradually diverged 
to fill every habitat on Earth with organisms that exploit the potential of 
the machinery in an endless variety of ways.

genes provide the instructions for Cell form, function, 
and Complex Behavior
A cell’s genome—that is, the entire sequence of nucleotides in an organ-
ism’s  DNA—provides  a  genetic  program  that  instructs  the  cell  how  to 
behave. For the cells of plant and animal embryos, the genome directs 
the growth and development of an adult organism with hundreds of dif-
ferent cell types. Within an individual plant or animal, these cells can be 
extraordinarily varied, as we discuss in Chapter 20. Fat cells, skin cells, 
bone cells, and nerve cells seem as dissimilar as any cells could be. Yet 
all these differentiated cell types are generated during embryonic develop-
ment from a single fertilized egg cell, and all contain identical copies of 
the DNA of the species. Their varied characters stem from the way that 
individual cells use their genetic instructions. Different cells express dif-
ferent genes: that is, they use their genes to produce some proteins and 
not others, depending on their internal state and on cues that they and 
their ancestor cells have received from their surroundings—mainly sig-
nals from other cells in the organism.
The DNA, therefore, is not just a shopping list specifying the molecules 
that every cell must make, and a cell is not just an assembly of all the 
items on the list. Each cell is capable of carrying out a variety of biologi-
cal tasks, depending on its environment and its history, and it selectively 
uses the information encoded in its DNA to guide its activities. Later in 
this book, we will see in detail how DNA defines both the parts list of the 
cell and the rules that decide when and where these parts are to be made.

Cells Under the MiCrosCope

Today,  we  have  the  technology  to  decipher  the  underlying  principles 
that govern the structure and activity of the cell. But cell biology started 
without these tools. The earliest cell biologists began by simply looking 
at  tissues  and  cells,  and  later  breaking  them  open  or  slicing  them  up, 
attempting to view their contents. What they saw was to them profoundly 
baffling—a collection of tiny and scarcely visible objects whose relation-
ship to the properties of living matter seemed an impenetrable mystery. 
Nevertheless, this type of visual investigation was the first step toward 
understanding cells, and it remains essential in the study of cell biology.
Cells  were  not  made  visible  until  the  seventeenth  century,  when  the 
microscope  was  invented.  For  hundreds  of  years  afterward,  all  that 
was  known  about  cells  was  discovered  using  this  instrument.  Light 
microscopes use visible light to illuminate specimens, and they allowed 
biologists to see for the first time the intricate structure that underpins all 
living things. 
Although  these 
incorporate  many  sophisticated 
improvements, the properties of light itself set a limit to the fineness of 
detail they reveal. Electron microscopes, invented in the 1930s, go beyond 
this  limit  by  using  beams  of  electrons  instead  of  beams  of  light  as  the 
source of illumination, greatly extending our ability to see the fine details 
of cells and even making some of the larger molecules visible individ-
ually.  These  and  other  forms  of  microscopy  remain  vital  tools  in  the 
modern cell biology laboratory, where they continue to reveal new and 
sometimes surprising details about the way cells are built and how they 
operate.

the invention of the light Microscope led to the 
discovery of Cells
The development of the light microscope depended on advances in the 
production of glass lenses. By the seventeenth century, lenses were pow-
erful  enough  to  make  out  details  invisible  to  the  naked  eye.  Using  an 
instrument equipped with such a lens, Robert Hooke examined a piece 
of cork and in 1665 reported to the Royal Society of London that the cork 
was  composed  of  a  mass  of  minute  chambers.  He  called  these  cham-
bers “cells,” based on their resemblance to the simple rooms occupied 
by monks in a monastery. The name stuck, even though the structures 
Hooke described were actually the cell walls that remained after the living 
plant cells inside them had died. Later, Hooke and his Dutch contempo-
rary Antoni van Leeuwenhoek were able to observe living cells, seeing 
for the first time a world teeming with motile microscopic organisms.

For  almost  200  years,  such  instruments—the  first  light  microscopes—
remained exotic devices, available only to a few wealthy individuals. It 
was not until the nineteenth century that microscopes began to be widely 
used to look at cells. The emergence of cell biology as a distinct science 
was a gradual process to which many individuals contributed, but its offi-
cial birth is generally said to have been signaled by two publications: one 
by the botanist Matthias Schleiden in 1838 and the other by the zoolo-
gist Theodor Schwann in 1839. In these papers, Schleiden and Schwann 
documented the results of a systematic investigation of plant and animal 
tissues with the light microscope, showing that cells were the universal 
building blocks of all living tissues. Their work, and that of other nine-
teenth-century microscopists, slowly led to the realization that all living 
cells are formed by the growth and division of existing cells—a principle 
sometimes referred to as the cell theory (Figure 1–4). The implication that

living organisms do not arise spontaneously but can be generated only 
from existing organisms was hotly contested, but it was finally confirmed 
in the 1860s by an elegant set of experiments performed by Louis Pasteur.

The  principle  that  cells  are  generated  only  from  preexisting  cells  and 
inherit their characteristics from them underlies all of biology and gives 
the subject a unique flavor: in biology, questions about the present are 
inescapably  linked  to  questions  about  the  past.  To  understand  why 
present-day cells and organisms behave as they do, we need to under-
stand their history, all the way back to the misty origins of the first cells 
on Earth. Charles Darwin provided the key insight that makes this his-
tory comprehensible. His theory of evolution, published in 1859, explains 
how random variation and natural selection gave rise to diversity among 
organisms that share a common ancestry. When combined with the cell 
theory, the theory of evolution leads us to view all life, from its beginnings 
to the present day, as one vast family tree of individual cells. Although 
this book is primarily about how cells work today, we will encounter the 
theme of evolution again and again.

light Microscopes allow examination of Cells and some of 
their Components
If you cut a very thin slice from a suitable plant or animal tissue and view 
it  using  a  light  microscope,  you  will  see  that  the  tissue  is  divided  into 
thousands of small cells. These may be either closely packed or separated 
from one another by an extracellular matrix, a dense material often made 
of protein fibers embedded in a polysaccharide gel (Figure 1–5). Each cell 
is  typically  about  5–20  μm  in  diameter.  If  you  have  taken  care  of  your 
specimen so that its cells remain alive, you will be able to see particles 
moving  around  inside  individual  cells.  And  if  you  watch  patiently,  you 
may even see a cell slowly change shape and divide into two (see Figure 
1–4 and a speeded-up video of cell division in a frog embryo in Movie 1.1).

To  see  the  internal  structure  of  a  cell  is  difficult,  not  only  because  the 
parts are small, but also because they are transparent and mostly color-
less. One way around the problem is to stain cells with dyes that color 
particular components differently (see Figure 1–5). Alternatively, one can 
exploit the fact that cell components differ slightly from one another in

refractive index, just as glass differs in refractive index from water, caus-
ing light rays to be deflected as they pass from the one medium into the 
other. The small differences in refractive index can be made visible by 
specialized optical techniques, and the resulting images can be enhanced 
further by electronic processing.
The  cell  thus  revealed  has  a  distinct  anatomy  (Figure  1–6a).  It  has 
a  sharply  defined  boundary,  indicating  the  presence  of  an  enclosing 
membrane.  A  large,  round  structure,  the  nucleus,  is  prominent  in  the 
middle of the cell. Around the nucleus and filling the cell’s interior is the  
cytoplasm, a transparent substance crammed with what seems at first to 
be a jumble of miscellaneous objects. With a good light microscope, one 
can begin to distinguish and classify some of the specific components in 
the cytoplasm, but structures smaller than about 0.2 μm—about half the 
wavelength of visible light—cannot normally be resolved; points closer 
than this are not distinguishable and appear as a single blur.

In recent years, however, new types of fluorescence microscopes have 
been developed that use sophisticated methods of illumination and elec-
tronic image processing to see fluorescently labeled cell components in 
much  finer  detail  (Figure  1–6B).  The  most  recent  super-resolution  flu-
orescence  microscopes,  for  example,  can  push  the  limits  of  resolution 
down even further, to about 20 nanometers (nm). That is the size of a 
single ribosome, a large macromolecular complex composed of 80–90 
individual proteins and RNA molecules.

the fine structure of a Cell is revealed by electron 
Microscopy
For the highest magnification and best resolution, one must turn to an 
electron  microscope,  which  can  reveal  details  down  to  a  few  nano-
meters.  Cell  samples  for  the  electron  microscope  require  painstaking 
preparation. Even for light microscopy, a tissue often has to be fixed (that 
is, preserved by pickling in a reactive chemical solution), supported by 
embedding in a solid wax or resin, cut or sectioned into thin slices, and 
stained before it is viewed. For electron microscopy, similar procedures 
are required, but the sections have to be much thinner and there is no 
possibility of looking at living, wet cells.

When thin sections are cut, stained, and placed in the electron microscope, 
much of the jumble of cell components becomes sharply resolved into 
distinct  organelles—separate,  recognizable  substructures  with  special-
ized functions that are often only hazily defined with a light microscope. 
A delicate membrane, only about 5 nm thick, is visible enclosing the cell, 
and  similar  membranes  form  the  boundary  of  many  of  the  organelles 
inside (Figure 1–7a, B). The membrane that separates the interior of the 
cell from its external environment is called the plasma membrane, while 
the  membranes  surrounding  organelles  are  called  internal  membranes. 
All  of  these  membranes  are  only  two  molecules  thick  (as  discussed  in 
Chapter  11).  With  an  electron  microscope,  even  individual  large  mole-
cules can be seen (Figure 1–7C).

ECB4 e1.08/1.07

The type of electron microscope used to look at thin sections of tissue is 
known as a transmission electron microscope. This is, in principle, simi-
lar  to  a  light  microscope,  except  that  it  transmits  a  beam  of  electrons 
rather than a beam of light through the sample. Another type of electron 
microscope—the scanning electron microscope—scatters electrons off the 
surface of the sample and so is used to look at the surface detail of cells 
and other structures. A survey of the principal types of microscopy used 
to examine cells is given in panel 1–1 (pp. 10–11).

and can reveal their location when examined with a 
ﬂuorescence microscope. An example is the stain for 
DNA shown here (green ). Other dyes can be coupled 
to antibody molecules, which then serve as highly 
speciﬁc and versatile staining reagents that bind 
selectively to particular large molecules, allowing us

is stained red with a ﬂuorescent antibody. (Courtesy

CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY
A confocal microscope is a specialized type of ﬂuorescence microscope that builds up an 
image by scanning the specimen with a laser beam. The beam is focused onto a single 
point at a speciﬁc depth in the specimen, and a pinhole aperture in the detector allows 
only ﬂuorescence emitted from this same point to be included in the image. Scanning the 
beam across the specimen generates a sharp image of the plane of focus—an optical 
section. A series of optical sections at different depths allows a three-dimensional image 
to be constructed. An intact insect embryo is shown here stained with a ﬂuorescent probe 
for actin ﬁlaments. (A) Conventional ﬂuorescence microscopy gives a blurry image due to 
the presence of ﬂuorescent structures above and below the plane of focus. (B) Confocal 
microscopy provides an optical section showing the individual cells clearly. (Courtesy of

specimen

In the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the specimen, which 
has been coated with a very thin ﬁlm of a heavy metal, is scanned 
by a beam of electrons brought to a focus on the specimen by 
magnetic coils that act as lenses. The quantity of electrons 
scattered or emitted as the beam bombards each successive point 
on the surface of the specimen is measured by the detector, and is 
used to control the intensity of successive points in an image built 
up on a video screen. The microscope creates striking images of 
three-dimensional objects with great depth of focus and can 
resolve details down to somewhere between 3 nm and 20 nm, 
depending on the instrument.

0.5 µm

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is in principle similar 
to a light microscope, but it uses a beam of electrons instead of a 
beam of light, and magnetic coils to focus the beam instead of 
glass lenses. The specimen, which is placed in a vacuum, must be 
very thin. Contrast is usually introduced by staining the specimen 
with electron-dense heavy metals that locally absorb or scatter 
electrons, removing them from the beam as it passes through 
the specimen. The TEM has a useful magniﬁcation of up to a 
million-fold and can resolve details as small as about 1 nm in 
biological specimens.

Even the most powerful electron microscopes, however, cannot visualize 
the individual atoms that make up biological molecules (Figure 1–8). To 
study the cell’s key components in atomic detail, biologists have developed 
even more sophisticated tools. A technique called X-ray crystallography, 
for example, is used to determine the precise three-dimensional structure 
of protein molecules (discussed in Chapter 4). 

the prokaryotiC Cell
Of all the types of cells revealed by the microscope, bacteria have the sim-
plest structure and come closest to showing us life stripped down to its 
essentials. Indeed, a bacterium contains essentially no organelles—not 
even a nucleus to hold its DNA. This property—the presence or absence 
of a nucleus—is used as the basis for a simple but fundamental classifica-
tion of all living things. Organisms whose cells have a nucleus are called 
eukaryotes  (from  the  Greek  words  eu,  meaning  “well”  or  “truly,”  and 
karyon, a “kernel” or “nucleus”). Organisms whose cells do not have a 
nucleus are called prokaryotes (from pro, meaning “before”). The terms

“bacterium” and “prokaryote” are often used interchangeably, although 
we will see that the category of prokaryotes also includes another class 
of cells, the archaea (singular archaeon), which are so remotely related to 
bacteria that they are given a separate name.
Prokaryotes are typically spherical, rodlike, or corkscrew-shaped (Figure 
1–9).  They  are  also  small—generally  just  a  few  micrometers  long, 
although there are some giant species as much as 100 times longer than 
this.  Prokaryotes  often  have  a  tough  protective  coat,  or  cell  wall,  sur-
rounding the plasma membrane, which encloses a single compartment 
containing the cytoplasm and the DNA. In the electron microscope, the 
cell interior typically appears as a matrix of varying texture, without any 
obvious organized internal structure (Figure 1–10). The cells reproduce 
quickly by dividing in two. Under optimum conditions, when food is plen-
tiful, many prokaryotic cells can duplicate themselves in as little as 20 
minutes. In 11 hours, by repeated divisions, a single prokaryote can give 
rise to more than 8 billion progeny (which exceeds the total number of 
humans presently on Earth). Thanks to their large numbers, rapid growth 
rates, and ability to exchange bits of genetic material by a process akin 
to sex, populations of prokaryotic cells can evolve fast, rapidly acquir-
ing the ability to use a new food source or to resist being killed by a new 
antibiotic.

prokaryotes are the Most diverse and numerous Cells  
on earth
Most  prokaryotes  live  as  single-celled  organisms,  although  some  join 
together to form chains, clusters, or other organized multicellular struc-
tures. In shape and structure, prokaryotes may seem simple and limited, 
but in terms of chemistry, they are the most diverse and inventive class of 
cells. Members of this class exploit an enormous range of habitats, from 
hot puddles of volcanic mud to the interiors of other living cells, and they 
vastly outnumber all eukaryotic organisms on Earth. Some are aerobic, 
using oxygen to oxidize food molecules; some are strictly anaerobic and 
are killed by the slightest exposure to oxygen. As we discuss later in this

chapter, mitochondria—the organelles that generate energy in eukaryo-
tic  cells—are  thought  to  have  evolved  from  aerobic  bacteria  that  took 
to living inside the anaerobic ancestors of today’s eukaryotic cells. Thus 
our own oxygen-based metabolism can be regarded as a product of the 
activities of bacterial cells.

Virtually any organic, carbon-containing material—from wood to petro-
leum—can  be  used  as  food  by  one  sort  of  bacterium  or  another.  Even 
more remarkably, some prokaryotes can live entirely on inorganic sub-
stances:  they  can  get  their  carbon  from  CO2  in  the  atmosphere,  their 
nitrogen from atmospheric N2, and their oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and 
phosphorus  from  air,  water,  and  inorganic  minerals.  Some  of  these 
prokaryotic  cells,  like  plant  cells,  perform  photosynthesis,  using  energy 
from sunlight to produce organic molecules from CO2 (Figure 1–11); oth-
ers derive energy from the chemical reactivity of inorganic substances in 
the environment (Figure 1–12). In either case, such prokaryotes play a 
unique and fundamental part in the economy of life on Earth: other living 
things depend on the organic compounds that these cells generate from 
inorganic materials.

Plants,  too,  can  capture  energy  from  sunlight  and  carbon  from  atmos-
pheric CO2. But plants unaided by bacteria cannot capture N2 from the 
atmosphere, and in a sense even plants depend on bacteria for photo-
synthesis.  It  is  almost  certain  that  the  organelles  in  the  plant  cell  that

thetic bacteria that long ago found a home inside the cytoplasm of a plant 
cell ancestor.

the World of prokaryotes is divided into two domains: 
Bacteria and archaea
Traditionally, all prokaryotes have been classified together in one large 
group. But molecular studies reveal that there is a gulf within the class 
of prokaryotes, dividing it into two distinct domains called the bacteria 
and the archaea. Remarkably, at a molecular level, the members of these 
two domains differ as much from one another as either does from the 
eukaryotes. Most of the prokaryotes familiar from everyday life—the spe-
cies that live in the soil or make us ill—are bacteria. Archaea are found 
not only in these habitats, but also in environments that are too hostile 
for most other cells: concentrated brine, the hot acid of volcanic springs, 
the airless depths of marine sediments, the sludge of sewage treatment 
plants, pools beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica, and in the acidic, 
oxygen-free environment of a cow’s stomach where they break down cel-
lulose and generate methane gas. Many of these extreme environments 
resemble  the  harsh  conditions  that  must  have  existed  on  the  primitive 
Earth,  where  living  things  first  evolved  before  the  atmosphere  became 
rich in oxygen.

the eUkaryotiC Cell
Eukaryotic cells, in general, are bigger and more elaborate than bacte-
ria and archaea. Some live independent lives as single-celled organisms, 
such  as  amoebae  and  yeasts  (Figure  1–13);  others  live  in  multicellular 
assemblies. All of the more complex multicellular organisms—including 
plants, animals, and fungi—are formed from eukaryotic cells.

By  definition,  all  eukaryotic  cells  have  a  nucleus.  But  possession  of 
a  nucleus  goes  hand-in-hand  with  possession  of  a  variety  of  other 
organelles,  most  of  which  are  membrane-enclosed  and  common  to 
all  eukaryotic  organisms.  In  this  section,  we  take  a  look  at  the  main 
organelles found in eukaryotic cells from the point of view of their func-
tions, and we consider how they came to serve the roles they have in the 
life of the eukaryotic cell. 

the nucleus is the information store of the Cell
The nucleus is usually the most prominent organelle in a eukaryotic cell 
(Figure 1–14). It is enclosed within two concentric membranes that form 
the nuclear envelope, and it contains molecules of DNA—extremely long 
polymers  that  encode  the  genetic  information  of  the  organism.  In  the 
light microscope, these giant DNA molecules become visible as individual 
chromosomes  when  they  become  more  compact  before  a  cell  divides 
into two daughter cells (Figure 1–15). DNA also carries the genetic infor-
mation in prokaryotic cells; these cells lack a distinct nucleus not because 
they lack DNA, but because they do not keep their DNA inside a nuclear 
envelope, segregated from the rest of the cell contents.

Figure 1–13 Yeasts are simple free-living eukaryotes. the 
cells shown in this micrograph belong to the species of yeast, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, used to make dough rise and turn 
malted barley juice into beer. as can be seen in this image, the cells 
reproduce by growing a bud and then dividing asymmetrically into a 
large mother cell and a small daughter cell; for this reason, they are 
called budding yeast.

Mitochondria generate Usable energy from food to 
power the Cell
Mitochondria are present in essentially all eukaryotic cells, and they are 
among  the  most  conspicuous  organelles  in  the  cytoplasm  (see  Figure 
1–7B). In a fluorescence microscope, they appear as worm-shaped struc-
tures  that  often  form  branching  networks  (Figure  1–16).  When  seen 
with  an  electron  microscope,  individual  mitochondria  are  found  to  be 
enclosed in two separate membranes, with the inner membrane formed 
into folds that project into the interior of the organelle (Figure 1–17). 

Microscopic  examination  by  itself,  however,  gives  little  indication   of 
what mitochondria do. Their function was discovered by breaking open 
cells and then spinning the soup of cell fragments in a centrifuge; this

separates  the  organelles  according  to  their  size  and  density.  Purified 
mitochondria  were  then  tested  to  see  what  chemical  processes  they 
could perform. This revealed that mitochondria are generators of chemi-
cal energy for the cell. They harness the energy from the oxidation of food 
molecules, such as sugars, to produce adenosine triphosphate, or ATP—
the basic chemical fuel that powers most of the cell’s activities. Because 
the mitochondrion consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide in the 
course  of  this  activity,  the  entire  process  is  called  cellular  respiration—
essentially, breathing on a cellular level. Without mitochondria, animals, 
fungi, and plants would be unable to use oxygen to extract the energy 
they need from the food molecules that nourish them. The process of cel-
lular respiration is considered in detail in Chapter 14.

Figure 1–18 Mitochondria most likely 
evolved from engulfed bacteria. It is 
virtually certain that mitochondria originate 
from bacteria that were engulfed by an 
ancestral pre-eukaryotic cell and survived 
inside it, living in symbiosis with their host. 
Note that the double membrane of present-
day mitochondria is thought to have been 
derived from the plasma membrane and 
outer membrane of the engulfed bacterium.

Because  they  resemble  bacteria  in  so  many  ways,  they  are  thought  to 
have been derived from bacteria that were engulfed by some ancestor 
of  present-day  eukaryotic  cells  (Figure  1–18).  This  evidently  created  a 
symbiotic relationship in which the host eukaryote and the engulfed bac-
terium helped one another to survive and reproduce.

Chloroplasts Capture energy from sunlight
Chloroplasts are large, green organelles that are found only in the cells 
of plants and algae, not in the cells of animals or fungi. These organelles 
have an even more complex structure than mitochondria: in addition to 
their two surrounding membranes, they possess internal stacks of mem-
branes containing the green pigment chlorophyll (Figure 1–19). 

Chloroplasts  carry  out  photosynthesis—trapping  the  energy  of  sun-
light  in  their  chlorophyll  molecules  and  using  this  energy  to  drive  the 
manufacture of energy-rich sugar molecules. In the process, they release

oxygen as a molecular by-product. Plant cells can then extract this stored 
chemical  energy  when  they  need  it,  by  oxidizing  these  sugars  in  their 
mitochondria, just as animal cells do. Chloroplasts thus enable plants to 
get their energy directly from sunlight. And they allow plants to produce 
the food molecules—and the oxygen—that mitochondria use to generate 
chemical energy in the form of ATP. How these organelles work together 
is discussed in Chapter 14.

ECB4 e1.21/1.20

Like  mitochondria,  chloroplasts  contain  their  own  DNA,  reproduce 
by  dividing  in  two,  and  are  thought  to  have  evolved  from  bacteria—in 
this  case,  from  photosynthetic  bacteria  that  were  engulfed  by  an  early 
eukaryotic cell (Figure 1–20). 

internal Membranes Create intracellular Compartments 
with different functions
Nuclei,  mitochondria,  and  chloroplasts  are  not  the  only  membrane-
enclosed  organelles  inside  eukaryotic  cells.  The  cytoplasm  contains  a 
profusion of other organelles that are surrounded by single membranes 
(see Figure 1–7A). Most of these structures are involved with the cell’s 
ability to import raw materials and to export both the useful substances 
and waste products that are produced by the cell. 

The  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)  is  an  irregular  maze  of  interconnected 
spaces enclosed by a membrane (Figure 1–21). It is the site where most 
cell-membrane  components,  as  well  as  materials  destined  for  export 
from the cell, are made. This organelle is enormously enlarged in cells 
that  are  specialized  for  the  secretion  of  proteins.  Stacks  of  flattened, 
membrane-enclosed  sacs  constitute  the  Golgi  apparatus  (Figure  1–22), 
which modifies and packages molecules made in the ER that are destined 
to  be  either  secreted  from  the  cell  or  transported  to  another  cell  com-
partment.  Lysosomes  are  small,  irregularly  shaped  organelles  in  which 
intracellular digestion occurs, releasing nutrients from ingested food par-
ticles and breaking down unwanted molecules for either recycling within 
the cell or excretion from the cell. Indeed, many of the large and small 
molecules within the cell are constantly being broken down and remade. 
Peroxisomes are small, membrane-enclosed vesicles that provide a safe 
environment  for  a  variety  of  reactions  in  which  hydrogen  peroxide  is 
used to inactivate toxic molecules. Membranes also form many different 
types of small transport vesicles that ferry materials between one mem-
brane-enclosed organelle and another. All of these membrane-enclosed 
organelles are sketched in Figure 1–23a.

A continual exchange of materials takes place between the endoplasmic 
reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the lysosomes, and the outside of the cell. 
The exchange is mediated by transport vesicles that pinch off from the 
membrane of one organelle and fuse with another, like tiny soap bubbles 
budding from and rejoining larger bubbles. At the surface of the cell, for 
example,  portions  of  the  plasma  membrane  tuck  inward  and  pinch  off 
to form vesicles that carry material captured from the external medium 
into the cell—a process called endocytosis (Figure 1–24). Animal cells can

engulf very large particles, or even entire foreign cells, by endocytosis. In 
the reverse process, called exocytosis, vesicles from inside the cell fuse 
with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the external 
medium (see Figure 1–24); most of the hormones and signal molecules 
that allow cells to communicate with one another are secreted from cells 
by exocytosis. How membrane-enclosed organelles move proteins and 
other molecules from place to place inside the cell is discussed in detail 
in Chapter 15.

the Cytosol is a Concentrated aqueous gel of large and 
small Molecules
If we were to strip the plasma membrane from a eukaryotic cell and then 
remove all of its membrane-enclosed organelles, including the nucleus, 
endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and 
so  on,  we  would  be  left  with  the  cytosol  (see  Figure  1–23B).  In  other 
words, the cytosol is the part of the cytoplasm that is not contained within 
intracellular membranes. In most cells, the cytosol is the largest single 
compartment. It contains a host of large and small molecules, crowded 
together so closely that it behaves more like a water-based gel than a 
liquid  solution  (Figure  1–25).  The  cytosol  is  the  site  of  many  chemical 
reactions that are fundamental to the cell’s existence. The early steps in 
the breakdown of nutrient molecules take place in the cytosol, for exam-
ple, and it is here that most proteins are made by ribosomes. 

the Cytoskeleton is responsible for directed Cell 
Movements
The cytoplasm is not just a structureless soup of chemicals and organelles. 
Using an electron microscope, one can see that in eukaryotic cells the 
cytosol is criss-crossed by long, fine filaments. Frequently, the filaments 
are seen to be anchored at one end to the plasma membrane or to radi-
ate out from a central site adjacent to the nucleus. This system of protein 
filaments, called the cytoskeleton, is composed of three major filament 
types  (Figure  1–26).  The  thinnest  of  these  filaments  are  the  actin  fila-
ments; they are abundant in all eukaryotic cells but occur in especially 
large  numbers  inside  muscle  cells,  where  they  serve  as  a  central  part 
of  the  machinery  responsible  for  muscle  contraction.  The  thickest  fila-
ments in the cytosol are called microtubules, because they have the form 
of minute hollow tubes. In dividing cells, they become reorganized into a 
spectacular array that helps pull the duplicated chromosomes in opposite

directions and distribute them equally to the two daughter cells (Figure 
1–27).  Intermediate  in  thickness  between  actin  filaments  and  microtu-
bules are the intermediate filaments, which serve to strengthen the cell. 
These three types of filaments, together with other proteins that attach to 
them, form a system of girders, ropes, and motors that gives the cell its 
mechanical strength, controls its shape, and drives and guides its move-
ments (Movie 1.2 and Movie 1.3). 
Because  the  cytoskeleton  governs  the  internal  organization  of  the  cell 
as well as its external features, it is as necessary to a plant cell—boxed 
in by a tough wall of extracellular matrix—as it is to an animal cell that 
freely  bends,  stretches,  swims,  or  crawls.  In  a  plant  cell,  for  example, 
organelles such as mitochondria are driven in a constant stream around 
the cell interior along cytoskeletal tracks (Movie 1.4). And animal cells 
and plant cells alike depend on the cytoskeleton to separate their internal 
components into two daughter cells during cell division (see Figure 1–27).

The  cytoskeleton’s  role  in  cell  division  may  be  its  most  ancient  func-
tion. Even bacteria contain proteins that are distantly related to those of 
eukaryotic actin filaments and microtubules, forming filaments that play 
a part in prokaryotic cell division. We examine the cytoskeleton in detail 
in Chapter 17, discuss its role in cell division in Chapter 18, and review 
how it responds to signals from outside the cell in Chapter 16.

the Cytoplasm is far from static
The  cell  interior  is  in  constant  motion.  The  cytoskeleton  is  a  dynamic 
jungle  of  protein  ropes  that  are  continually  being  strung  together  and 
taken apart; its filaments can assemble and then disappear in a matter 
of minutes. Motor proteins use the energy stored in molecules of ATP to 
trundle along these tracks and cables, carrying organelles and proteins 
throughout the cytoplasm, and racing across the width of the cell in sec-
onds. In addition, the large and small molecules that fill every free space 
in the cell are swept to and fro by random thermal motion, constantly 
colliding with one another and with other structures in the cell’s crowded 
cytoplasm (Movie 1–5).

Figure 1–26 The cytoskeleton is a 
network of protein filaments that criss-
crosses the cytoplasm of eukaryotic 
cells. the three major types of filaments

stains. Shown here are (a) actin filaments,

filaments. (a, courtesy of Simon Barry

Of course, neither the bustling nature of the cell’s interior nor the details 
of cell structure were appreciated when scientists first peered at cells in 
a microscope; our knowledge of cell structure accumulated slowly. A few 
of the key discoveries are listed in Table 1–1. In addition, panel 1–2 sum-
marizes the differences between animal, plant, and bacterial cells.

eukaryotic Cells May have originated as predators
Eukaryotic cells are typically 10 times the length and 1000 times the vol-
ume  of  prokaryotic  cells,  although  there  is  huge  size  variation  within 
each  category.  They  also  possess  a  whole  collection  of  features—a 
cytoskeleton,  mitochondria,  and  other  organelles—that  set  them  apart 
from bacteria and archaea.

When and how eukaryotes evolved these systems remains something of a 
mystery. Although eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea must have diverged 
from one another very early in the history of life on Earth (discussed in 
Chapter 14), the eukaryotes did not acquire all of their distinctive features 
at the same time (Figure 1–28). According to one theory, the ancestral 
eukaryotic cell was a predator that fed by capturing other cells. Such a 
way  of  life  requires  a  large  size,  a  flexible  membrane,  and  a  cytoskel-
eton to help the cell move and eat. The nuclear compartment may have 
evolved  to  keep  the  DNA  segregated  from  this  physical  and  chemical 
hurly-burly, so as to allow more delicate and complex control of the way 
the cell reads out its genetic information. 

Such  a  primitive  cell,  witha  nucleus  and  cytoskeleton,  was  most  likely 
the  sort  of  cell  that  engulfed  the  free-living,  oxygen-consuming  bacte-
ria that were the likely ancestors of the mitochondria (see Figure 1–18). 
This partnership is thought to have been established 1.5 billion years ago, 
when  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  first  became  rich  in  oxygen.  A  subset  of

visible chromosomes, each of which has 
duplicated to form a pair of conjoined

the microtubules are seen to radiate from 
foci at opposite ends of the dividing cell.

microorganisms  called  protozoans.  Didinium,  for  example,  is  a  large, 
carnivorous  protozoan  with  a  diameter  of  about  150  μm—roughly  10 
times that of the average human cell. It has a globular body encircled by 
two fringes of cilia, and its front end is flattened except for a single pro-
trusion rather like a snout (Figure 1–29a). Didinium swims at high speed 
by means of its beating cilia. When it encounters a suitable prey, usually 
another type of protozoan, it releases numerous small, paralyzing darts 
from its snout region. Didinium then attaches to and devours the other 
cell, inverting like a hollow ball to engulf its victim, which can be almost 
as large as itself (Figure 1–29B). 

ECB4 e1.30/1.29

Not all protozoans are predators. They can be photosynthetic or carnivo-
rous, motile or sedentary. Their anatomy is often elaborate and includes 
such structures as sensory bristles, photoreceptors, beating cilia, stalk-
like appendages, mouthparts, stinging darts, and musclelike contractile 
bundles (Figure 1–30). Although they are single cells, protozoans can be 
as intricate and versatile as many multicellular organisms. Much remains 
to be learned about fundamental cell biology from studies of these fasci-
nating life-forms.

Model organisMs
All cells are thought to be descended from a common ancestor, whose 
fundamental  properties  have  been  conserved  through  evolution.  Thus 
knowledge  gained  from  the  study  of  one  organism  contributes  to  our 
understanding of others, including ourselves. But certain organisms are 
easier than others to study in the laboratory. Some reproduce rapidly and 
are  convenient  for  genetic  manipulations;  others  are  multicellular  but 
transparent, so that one can directly watch the development of all their 
internal tissues and organs. For reasons such as these, large communi-
ties of biologists have become dedicated to studying different aspects of 
the biology of a few chosen species, pooling their knowledge to gain a 
deeper understanding than could be achieved if their efforts were spread 
over  many  different  species.  Although  the  roster  of  these  representa-
tive organisms is continually expanding, a few stand out in terms of the 
breadth and depth of information that has been accumulated about them 
over the years—knowledge that contributes to our understanding of how 
all cells work. In this section, we examine some of these model organ-
isms and review the benefits that each offers to the study of cell biology 
and, in many cases, to the promotion of human health.

Molecular Biologists have focused on E. coli
In  molecular  terms,  we  understand  the  workings  of  the  bacterium 
Escherichia  coli—E.  coli  for  short—more  thoroughly  than  those  of  any 
other living organism (see Figure 1–10). This small, rod-shaped cell nor-
mally lives in the gut of humans and other vertebrates, but it also grows 
happily  and  reproduces  rapidly  in  a  simple  nutrient  broth  in  a  culture 
bottle. 

ECB4 e1.31/1.30

Most of our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of life—including 
how cells replicate their DNA and how they decode these genetic instruc-
tions  to  make  proteins—has  come  from  studies  of  E.  coli.  Subsequent 
research has confirmed that these basic processes occur in essentially the 
same way in our own cells as they do in E. coli.

Brewer’s yeast is a simple eukaryotic Cell
We  tend  to  be  preoccupied  with  eukaryotes  because  we  are  eukary- 
otes ourselves. But human cells are complicated and reproduce relatively 
slowly. To get a handle on the fundamental biology of eukaryotic cells, 
it  is  often  advantageous  to  study  a  simpler  cell  that  reproduces  more 
rapidly.  A  popular  choice  has  been  the  budding  yeast  Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (Figure 1–31)—the same microorganism that is used for brew-
ing beer and baking bread.

S.  cerevisiae  is  a  small,  single-celled  fungus  that  is  at  least  as  closely 
related to animals as it is to plants. Like other fungi, it has a rigid cell wall, 
is relatively immobile, and possesses mitochondria but not chloroplasts. 
When nutrients are plentiful, S. cerevisiae reproduces almost as rapidly as 
a bacterium. Yet it carries out all the basic tasks that every eukaryotic cell 
must perform. Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have been crucial 
to understanding many basic mechanisms in eukaryotic cells, including 
the cell-division cycle—the chain of events by which the nucleus and all 
the other components of a cell are duplicated and parceled out to create 
two  daughter  cells.  The  machinery  that  governs  cell  division  has  been

so well conserved over the course of evolution that many of its compo-
nents can function interchangeably in yeast and human cells (see how 
We know, pp. 30–31). Darwin himself would no doubt have been stunned 
by this dramatic example of evolutionary conservation.

Arabidopsis has Been Chosen as a Model plant
The  large  multicellular  organisms  that  we  see  around  us—both  plants 
and animals—seem fantastically varied, but they are much closer to one 
another  in  their  evolutionary  origins,  and  more  similar  in  their  basic 
cell biology, than the great host of microscopic single-celled organisms. 
Whereas  bacteria,  archaea,  and  eukaryotes  separated  from  each  other 
more than 3 billion years ago, plants, animals, and fungi diverged only 
about 1.5 billion years ago, and the different species of flowering plants 
less than 200 million years ago.

The  close  evolutionary  relationship  among  all  flowering  plants  means 
that we can gain insight into their cell and molecular biology by focusing 
on just a few convenient species for detailed analysis. Out of the several 
hundred thousand species of flowering plants on Earth today, molecular 
biologists have focused their efforts on a small weed, the common wall 
cress  Arabidopsis  thaliana  (Figure  1–32),  which  can  be  grown  indoors 
in large numbers: one plant can produce thousands of offspring within 
8–10  weeks.  Because  genes  found  in  Arabidopsis  have  counterparts  in 
agricultural  species,  studying  this  simple  weed  provides  insights  into 
the development and physiology of the crop plants upon which our lives 
depend, as well as into the evolution of all the other plant species that 
dominate nearly every ecosystem on Earth.

Model animals include flies, fish, Worms, and Mice
Multicellular  animals  account  for  the  majority  of  all  named  species  of 
living organisms, and the majority of animal species are insects. It is fit-
ting, therefore, that an insect, the small fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster 
(Figure  1–33),  should  occupy  a  central  place  in  biological  research.  In 
fact, the foundations of classical genetics were built to a large extent on 
studies of this insect. More than 80 years ago, genetic analysis of the fruit 
fly  provided  definitive  proof  that  genes—the  units  of  heredity—are  car-
ried on chromosomes. In more recent times, Drosophila, more than any 
other organism, has shown us how the genetic instructions encoded in 
DNA molecules direct the development of a fertilized egg cell (or zygote) 
into an adult multicellular organism containing vast numbers of different 
cell types organized in a precise and predictable way. Drosophila mutants 
with  body  parts  strangely  misplaced  or  oddly  patterned  have  provided 
the  key  to  identifying  and  characterizing  the  genes  that  are  needed  to 
make a properly structured adult body, with gut, wings, legs, eyes, and 
all the other bits and pieces in their correct places. These genes—which 
are copied and passed on to every cell in the body—define how each cell 
will  behave  in  its  social  interactions  with  its  sisters  and  cousins,  thus 
controlling the structures that the cells can create. Moreover, the genes

responsible  for  the  development  of  Drosophila  have  turned  out  to  be 
amazingly similar to those of humans—far more similar than one would 
suspect  from  outward  appearances.  Thus  the  fly  serves  as  a  valuable 
model for studying human development and disease. 

ECB4 e1.34/1.33

Another widely studied organism is the nematode worm Caenorhabditis 
elegans (Figure 1–34), a harmless relative of the eelworms that attack the 
roots of crops. Smaller and simpler than Drosophila, this creature devel-
ops with clockwork precision from a fertilized egg cell into an adult that 
has  exactly  959  body  cells  (plus  a  variable  number  of  egg  and  sperm 
cells)—an  unusual  degree  of  regularity  for  an  animal.  We  now  have  a 
minutely  detailed  description  of  the  sequence  of  events  by  which  this 
occurs—as the cells divide, move, and become specialized according to 
strict  and  predictable  rules.  And  a  wealth  of  mutants  are  available  for 
testing how the worm’s genes direct this developmental ballet. Some 70% 
of human genes have some counterpart in the worm, and C. elegans, like 
Drosophila,  has  proved  to  be  a  valuable  model  for  many  of  the  devel-
opmental processes that occur in our own bodies. Studies of nematode 
development, for example, have led to a detailed molecular understand-
ing of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death by which surplus cells 
are  disposed  of  in  all  animals—a  topic  of  great  importance  for  cancer 
research (discussed in Chapters 18 and 20). 

Another organism that is providing molecular insights into developmen-
tal  processes,  particularly  in  vertebrates,  is  the  zebrafish.  Because  this

was the first multicellular organism to have its complete genome sequenced.

hOW WE kNOW
LIFE’S COMMON MEChaNISMS

All living things are made of cells, and all cells—as we 
have discussed in this chapter—are fundamentally simi-
lar  inside:  they  store  their  genetic  instructions  in  DNA 
molecules,  which  direct  the  production  of  RNA  mol-
ecules, which in turn direct the production of proteins. 
It is largely the proteins that carry out the cell’s chemi-
cal  reactions,  give  the  cell  its  shape,  and  control  its 
behavior.  But  how  deep  do  these  similarities  between 
cells—and  the  organisms  they  comprise—really  run? 
Are parts from one organism interchangeable with parts 
from another? Would an enzyme that breaks down glu-
cose in a bacterium be able to digest the same sugar if it 
were placed inside a yeast cell or a cell from a lobster or 
a human? What about the molecular machines that copy 
and interpret genetic information? Are they functionally 
equivalent from one organism to another? Insights have 
come  from  many  sources,  but  the  most  stunning  and 
dramatic answer came from experiments performed on  
humble  yeast  cells.  These  studies,  which  shocked  the 
biological community, focused on one of the most fun-
damental processes of life—cell division.

division and discovery
All  cells  come  from  other  cells,  and  the  only  way  to 
make  a  new  cell  is  through  division  of  a  preexisting 
one. To reproduce, a parent cell must execute an orderly 
sequence  of  reactions,  through  which  it  duplicates  its 
contents  and  divides  in  two.  This  critical  process  of 
duplication  and  division—known  as  the  cell-division 
cycle,  or  cell  cycle  for  short—is  complex  and  carefully 
controlled. Defects in any of the proteins involved can 
be devastating to the cell.

Fortunately  for  biologists,  this  acute  reliance  on  cru-
cial proteins makes them easy to identify and study. If a 
protein is essential for a given process, a mutation that 
results in an abnormal protein—or in no protein at all—
can  prevent  the  cell  from  carrying  out  the  process.  By 
isolating organisms that are defective in their cell-divi-
sion cycle, scientists have worked backward to discover 
the proteins that control progress through the cycle. 

The  study  of  cell-cycle  mutants  has  been  particularly 
successful in yeasts. Yeasts are unicellular fungi and are 
popular  organisms  for  such  genetic  studies.  They  are 
eukaryotes,  like  us,  but  they  are  small,  simple,  rapidly 
reproducing, and easy to manipulate genetically. Yeast 
mutants  that  are  defective  in  their  ability  to  complete 
cell  division  have  led  to  the  discovery  of  many  genes 
that  control  the  cell-division  cycle—the  so-called  Cdc 
genes—and have provided a detailed understanding of 
how these genes, and the proteins they encode, actually 
work.

Paul  Nurse  and  his  colleagues  used  this  approach  to 
identify  Cdc  genes  in  the  yeast  Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe,  which  is  named  after  the  African  beer  from 
which it was first isolated. S. pombe is a rod-shaped cell, 
which grows by elongation at its ends and divides by fis-
sion into two, through the formation of a partition in the 
center of the rod. The researchers found that one of the 
Cdc genes they had identified, called Cdc2, was required 
to  trigger  several  key  events  in  the  cell-division  cycle. 
When that gene was inactivated by a mutation, the yeast 
cells  would  not  divide.  And  when  the  cells  were  pro-
vided  with  a  normal  copy  of  the  gene,  their  ability  to 
reproduce was restored.

It’s obvious that replacing a faulty Cdc2 gene in S. pombe 
with  a  functioning  Cdc2  gene  from  the  same  yeast 
should repair the damage and enable the cell to divide 
normally.  But  what  about  using  a  similar  cell-division 
gene from a different organism? That’s the question the 
Nurse team tackled next.

next of kin
Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  is  another  kind  of  yeast  and 
is one of a handful of model organisms biologists have 
chosen to study to expand their understanding of how 
cells work. Also used to brew beer, S. cerevisiae divides 
by forming a small bud that grows steadily until it sepa-
rates from the mother cell (see Figures 1–13 and 1–31). 
Although S. cerevisiae and S. pombe differ in their style of 
division, both rely on a complex network of interacting 
proteins to get the job done. But could the proteins from 
one type of yeast substitute for those of the other?

To  find  out,  Nurse  and  his  colleagues  prepared  DNA 
from healthy S. cerevisiae, and they introduced this DNA 
into S. pombe cells that contained a mutation in the Cdc2 
gene  that  kept  the  cells  from  dividing  when  the  tem-
perature was elevated. And they found that some of the 
mutant S. pombe cells regained the ability to proliferate 
when  warm.  If  spread  onto  a  culture  plate  containing 
a growth medium, the rescued cells could divide again 
and again to form visible colonies, each containing mil-
lions of individual yeast cells (Figure 1–35). Upon closer 
examination, the researchers discovered that these “res-
cued” yeast cells had received a fragment of DNA that 
contained the S. cerevisiae version of Cdc2—a gene that 
had  been  discovered  in  pioneering  studies  of  the  cell 
cycle by Lee Hartwell and colleagues.

The  result  was  exciting,  but  perhaps  not  all  that  sur-
prising.  After  all,  how  different  can  one  yeast  be  from 
another? A more demanding test would be to use DNA 
from a more distant relative. So Nurse’s team repeated 
the  experiment,  this  time  using  human  DNA.  And  the 
results  were  the  same.  The  human  equivalent  of  the  

Model Organisms         

31

two  organisms  would  orchestrate  cell  division  in  such 
a  similar  way.  But  the  results  clearly  showed  that  the 
human  and  yeast  proteins  are  functionally  equivalent. 
Indeed,  Nurse  and  colleagues  demonstrated  that  the 
proteins are almost exactly the same size and consist of 
amino acids strung together in a very similar order; the 
human  Cdc2  protein  is  identical  to  the  S.  pombe  Cdc2 
protein in 63% of its amino acids and is identical to the 
equivalent protein from S. cerevisiae in 58% of its amino 
acids (Figure 1–36). Together with Tim Hunt, who dis-
covered a different cell-cycle protein called cyclin, Nurse 
and Hartwell shared a 2001 Nobel Prize for their studies 
of key regulators of the cell cycle. 

The Nurse experiments showed that proteins from very 
different  eukaryotes  can  be  functionally  interchange-
able  and  suggested  that  the  cell  cycle  is  controlled  in 
a  similar  fashion  in  every  eukaryotic  organism  alive 
today. Apparently, the proteins that orchestrate the cycle 
in eukaryotes are so fundamentally important that they 
have been conserved almost unchanged over more than 
a billion years of eukaryotic evolution.

The same experiment also highlights another, even more 
basic, point. The mutant yeast cells were rescued, not by 
direct injection of the human protein, but by introduc-
tion of a piece of human DNA. Thus the yeast cells could 
read and use this information correctly, indicating that, 
in eukaryotes, the molecular machinery for reading the 
information encoded in DNA is also similar from cell to 
cell  and  from  organism  to  organism.  A  yeast  cell  has 
all the equipment it needs to interpret the instructions 
encoded in a human gene and to use that information to 
direct the production of a fully functional human protein.

The story of Cdc2 is just one of thousands of examples of 
how research in yeast cells has provided critical insights 
into  human  biology.  Although  it  may  sound  paradoxi-
cal, the shortest, most efficient path to improving human 
health will often begin with detailed studies of the biol-
ogy  of  simple  organisms  such  as  brewer’s  or  baker’s 
yeast.

Figure 1–37 Zebrafish are popular models for studies of vertebrate 
development. (a) these small, hardy, tropical fish are a staple in many 
home aquaria. But they are also ideal for developmental studies, as their 
transparent embryos (B) make it easy to observe cells moving and changing

creature is transparent for the first 2 weeks of its life, it provides an ideal 
system in which to observe how cells behave during development in a 
living animal (Figure 1–37). 

Mammals are among the most complex of animals, and the mouse has 
long  been  used  as  the  model  organism  in  which  to  study  mammalian 
genetics, development, immunology, and cell biology. Thanks to modern 
molecular  biological  techniques,  it  is  now  possible  to  breed  mice  with 
deliberately engineered mutations in any specific gene, or with artificially 
constructed genes introduced into them. In this way, one can test what 
a given gene is required for and how it functions. Almost every human 
gene has a counterpart in the mouse, with a similar DNA sequence and 
function. Thus, this animal has proven an excellent model for studying 
genes that are important in both human health and disease.

Biologists also directly study human Beings and  
their Cells
Humans are not mice—or fish or flies or worms or yeast—and so we also 
study  human  beings  themselves.  Like  bacteria  or  yeast,  our  individual 
cells can be harvested and grown in culture, where we can study their 
biology and more closely examine the genes that govern their functions. 
Given  the  appropriate  surroundings,  most  human  cells—indeed,  most 
cells from animals or plants—will survive, proliferate, and even express 
specialized properties in a culture dish. Experiments using such cultured 
cells are sometimes said to be carried out in vitro (literally, “in glass”) to 
contrast them with experiments on intact organisms, which are said to be 
carried out in vivo (literally, “in the living”).

Although  not  true  for  all  types  of  cells,  many  types  of  cells  grown  in 
culture  display  the  differentiated  properties  appropriate  to  their  origin: 
fibroblasts,  a  major  cell  type  in  connective  tissue,  continue  to  secrete 
collagen;  cells  derived  from  embryonic  skeletal  muscle  fuse  to  form 
muscle  fibers,  which  contract  spontaneously  in  the  culture  dish;  nerve 
cells extend axons that are electrically excitable and make synapses with 
other nerve cells; and epithelial cells form extensive sheets, with many 
of the properties of an intact epithelium (Figure 1–38). Because cultured 
cells are maintained in a controlled environment, they are accessible to 
study in ways that are often not possible in vivo. For example, cultured 
cells can be exposed to hormones or growth factors, and the effects that 
these signal molecules have on the shape or behavior of the cells can be 
easily explored.

In addition to studying human cells in culture, humans are also exam-
ined directly in clinics. Much of the research on human biology has been 
driven by medical interests, and the medical database on the human spe-
cies is enormous. Although naturally occurring mutations in any given 
human gene are rare, the consequences of many mutations are well doc-
umented. This is because humans are unique among animals in that they 
report and record their own genetic defects: in no other species are bil-
lions of individuals so intensively examined, described, and investigated. 

Nevertheless,  the  extent  of  our  ignorance  is  still  daunting.  The  mam-
malian  body  is  enormously  complex,  being  formed  from  thousands  of

billions of cells, and one might despair of ever understanding how the 
DNA in a fertilized mouse egg cell makes it generate a mouse rather than 
a fish, or how the DNA in a human egg cell directs the development of 
a human rather than a mouse. Yet the revelations of molecular biology 
ECB4 e4.48/1.38
have made the task seem eminently approachable. As much as anything, 
this new optimism has come from the realization that the genes of one 
type of animal have close counterparts in most other types of animals, 
apparently serving similar functions (Figure 1–39). We all have a com-
mon evolutionary origin, and under the surface it seems that we share 
the same molecular mechanisms. Flies, worms, fish, mice, and humans 
thus provide a key to understanding how animals in general are made 
and how their cells work.

Comparing genome sequences reveals life’s Common 
heritage
At a molecular level, evolutionary change has been remarkably slow. We 
can see in present-day organisms many features that have been preserved 
through more than 3 billion years of life on Earth—about one-fifth of the 
age of the universe. This evolutionary conservatism provides the founda-
tion on which the study of molecular biology is built. To set the scene for 
the chapters that follow, therefore, we end this chapter by considering a 
little more closely the family relationships and basic similarities among 
all living things. This topic has been dramatically clarified in the past few 
years by technological advances that have allowed us to determine the 
complete genome sequences of thousands of organisms, including our 
own species (as discussed in more detail in Chapter 9).

The  first  thing  we  note  when  we  look  at  an  organism’s  genome  is  its 
overall  size  and  how  many  genes  it  packs  into  that  length  of  DNA. 
Prokaryotes carry very little superfluous genetic baggage and, nucleotide- 

Figure 1–39 Different species share 
similar genes. the human baby and the 
mouse shown here have similar white 
patches on their foreheads because they 
both have defects in the same gene (called 
Kit ), which is required for the development 
and maintenance of some pigment cells.

Figure 1–40 Organisms vary enormously 
in the size of their genomes. Genome size 
is measured in nucleotide pairs of DNa per 
haploid genome, that is, per single copy 
of the genome. (the body cells of sexually 
reproducing organisms such as ourselves 
are generally diploid: they contain two 
copies of the genome, one inherited from 
the mother, the other from the father.) 
closely related organisms can vary widely 
in the quantity of DNa in their genomes (as 
indicated by the length of the green bars), 
even though they contain similar numbers 
of functionally distinct genes. (adapted from

genomes.  E.  coli,  for  example,  carries  its  genetic  instructions  in  a  sin-
gle, circular, double-stranded molecule of DNA that contains 4.6 million 
nucleotide pairs and 4300 genes. The simplest known bacterium contains 
only about 500 genes, but most prokaryotes have genomes that contain 
at least 1 million nucleotide pairs and 1000–8000 genes. With these few 
thousand genes, prokaryotes are able to thrive in even the most hostile 
environments on Earth.

ECB4 e1.41/1.40

The compact genomes of typical bacteria are dwarfed by the genomes of 
typical eukaryotes. The human genome, for example, contains about 700 
times more DNA than the E. coli genome, and the genome of an amoeba 
contains about 100 times more than ours (Figure 1–40). The rest of the 
model organisms we have described have genomes that fall somewhere 
in between E. coli and human in terms of size. S. cerevisiae contains about 
2.5 times as much DNA as E. coli; Drosophila has about 10 times more 
DNA per cell than yeast; and mice have about 20 times more DNA per cell 
than the fruit fly (Table 1–2).

In terms of gene numbers, however, the differences are not so great. We 
have only about six times as many genes as E. coli. Moreover, many of 
our  genes—and the proteins they encode—fall into closely related fam-
ily  groups,  such  as  the  family  of  hemoglobins,  which  has  nine  closely 
related members in humans. Thus the number of fundamentally different 
proteins in a human is not very many times more than in a bacterium, 
and the number of human genes that have identifiable counterparts in the 
bacterium is a significant fraction of the total. 

This high degree of “family resemblance” is striking when we compare 
the genome sequences of different organisms. When genes from different 
organisms have very similar nucleotide sequences, it is highly probable 
that  both  descended  from a  common  ancestral gene. Such  genes  (and 
their protein products) are said to be homologous. Now that we have the 
complete genome sequences of many different organisms from all three 
domains of life—archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes—we can search sys-
tematically for homologies that span this enormous evolutionary divide. 
By taking stock of the common inheritance of all living things, scientists 
are attempting to trace life’s origins back to the earliest ancestral cells.

genomes Contain More than Just genes
Although our view of genome sequences tends to be “gene-centric,” our 
genomes contain much more than just genes. The vast bulk of our DNA 
does not code for proteins or for functional RNA molecules. Instead, it 
includes  a  mixture  of  sequences  that  help  regulate  gene  activity,  plus 
sequences that seem to be dispensable. The large quantity of regulatory 
DNA  contained  in  the  genomes  of  eukaryotic  multicellular  organisms 
allows for enormous complexity and sophistication in the way different 
genes are brought into action at different times and places. Yet, in the 
end, the basic list of parts—the set of proteins that the cells can make, as 
specified by the DNA—is not much longer than the parts list of an auto-
mobile, and many of those parts are common not only to all animals, but 
also to the entire living world.

That  DNA  can  program  the  growth,  development,  and  reproduction  of 
living cells and complex organisms is truly amazing. In the rest of this 
book,  we  will  try  to  explain  what  is  known  about  how  cells  work—by 
examining  their  component  parts,  how  these  parts  work  together,  and 
how the genome of each cell directs the manufacture of the parts the cell 
needs to function and to reproduce.

natural selection is such a powerful force in evolution 
because cells with even a small proliferation advantage 
quickly outgrow their competitors. to illustrate this process, 
consider a cell culture that contains 1 million bacterial cells 
that double every 20 minutes. a single cell in this culture 
acquires a mutation that allows it to divide faster, with a 
generation time of only 15 minutes. assuming that there is 
an unlimited food supply and no cell death, how long would 
it take before the progeny of the mutated cell became 
predominant in the culture? (Before you go through the 
calculation, make a guess: do you think it would take about 
a day, a week, a month, or a year?) how many cells of either 
type are present in the culture at this time? (the number of 
cells N in the culture at time t is described by the equation 
N = N0 × 2t/G, where N0 is the number of cells at zero time 
and G is the generation time.)

When bacteria are grown under adverse conditions, i.e., in 
the presence of a poison such as an antibiotic, most cells

that allows it to divide in an uncontrolled manner (i.e., it 
becomes a cancer cell). some cancer cells can proliferate 
with a generation time of about 24 hours. if none of the 
cancer cells died, how long would it take before 1013 cells in 
your body would be cancer cells? (Use the equation

would the latter ratio change if you included the internal 
membranes of the cell in the calculation of surface area 
(assume internal membranes have 15 times the area of the

4πr3/3 and its surface by 4πr2, where r is its radius.) discuss 
the following hypothesis: “internal membranes allowed

Chemical Components of Cells

It is at first sight difficult to accept that living creatures are merely chemi-
cal systems. Their incredible diversity of form, their seemingly purposeful 
behavior, and their ability to grow and reproduce all seem to set them 
apart from the world of solids, liquids, and gases that chemistry normally 
describes.  Indeed,  until  the  nineteenth  century,  it  was  widely  believed 
that animals contained a vital force—an “animus”—that was responsible 
for their distinctive properties.

We  now  know  that  there  is  nothing  in  living  organisms  that  disobeys 
chemical  or  physical  laws.  However,  the  chemistry  of  life  is  indeed  a 
special  kind.  First,  it  is  based  overwhelmingly  on  carbon  compounds, 
the  study  of  which  is  known  as  organic  chemistry.  Second,  it  depends 
almost  exclusively  on  chemical  reactions  that  take  place  in  a  watery, 
or aqueous, solution and in the relatively narrow range of temperatures 
experienced on Earth. Third, it is enormously complex: even the simplest 
cell is vastly more complicated in its chemistry than any other chemical 
system known. Fourth, it is dominated and coordinated by collections of 
enormous polymeric molecules—chains of chemical subunits linked end-
to-end—whose  unique  properties  enable  cells  and  organisms  to  grow 
and reproduce and to do all the other things that are characteristic of life. 
Finally, the chemistry of life is tightly regulated: cells deploy a variety of 
mechanisms to make sure that all their chemical reactions occur at the 
proper place and time.

Because chemistry lies at the heart of all biology, in this chapter, we briefly 
survey the chemistry of the living cell. We will meet the molecules from 
which cells are made and examine their structures, shapes, and chemical 
properties. These molecules determine the size, structure, and functions

exactly where an electron is at any given 
instant. the density of shading of the cloud 
is an indication of the probability that 
electrons will be found there. the diameter 
of the electron cloud ranges from about

Matter is made of combinations of elements—substances such as hydro-
gen or carbon that cannot be broken down or interconverted by chemical 
means. The smallest particle of an element that still retains its distinctive 
chemical properties is an atom. The characteristics of substances other 
than pure elements—including the materials from which living cells are 
made—depend on which atoms they contain and the way these atoms 
are  linked  together  in  groups  to  form  molecules.  To  understand  living 
organisms, therefore, it is crucial to know how the chemical bonds that 
hold atoms together in molecules are formed.

Cells Are Made of Relatively Few Types of Atoms
Each atom has at its center a dense, positively charged nucleus, which 
is surrounded at some distance by a cloud of negatively charged elec-
trons, held there by electrostatic attraction to the nucleus (Figure 2–1). 
The nucleus consists of two kinds of subatomic particles: protons, which 
are positively charged, and neutrons, which are electrically neutral. The 
number  of  protons  present  in  an  atom’s  nucleus  determines  its atomic 
number. An atom of hydrogen has a nucleus composed of a single pro-
ton; so hydrogen, with an atomic number of 1, is the lightest element. 
An atom of carbon has six protons in its nucleus and an atomic number 
of 6 (Figure 2–2). The electric charge carried by each proton is exactly 
equal and opposite to the charge carried by a single electron. Because 
the whole atom is electrically neutral, the number of negatively charged 
electrons  surrounding  the  nucleus  is  equal  to  the  number  of  positively 
charged protons that the nucleus contains; thus the number of electrons 
in  an  atom  also  equals  the  atomic  number.  All  atoms  of  a  given  ele-
ment have the same atomic number, and we will see shortly that it is this 
number that dictates each atom’s chemical behavior.

Neutrons have essentially the same mass as protons. They contribute to 
the structural stability of the nucleus—if there are too many or too few, 
the nucleus may disintegrate by radioactive decay—but they do not alter 
the chemical properties of the atom. Thus an element can exist in several 
physically  distinguishable  but  chemically  identical  forms,  called  iso-
topes, each having a different number of neutrons but the same number 
of protons. Multiple isotopes of almost all the elements occur naturally, 

Figure 2–2 The number of protons in 
an atom determines its atomic number. 
Schematic representations of an atom of 
carbon and an atom of hydrogen are shown. 
the nucleus of every atom except hydrogen 
consists of both positively charged protons 
and electrically neutral neutrons; the atomic 
weight equals the number of protons plus 
neutrons. the number of electrons in an 
atom is equal to the number of protons, so 
that the atom has no net charge. In contrast 
to Figure 2–1, the electrons are shown 
here as individual particles. the concentric 
black circles represent in a highly schematic 
form the “orbits” (that is, the different 
distributions) of the electrons. the neutrons, 
protons, and electrons are in reality minute 
in relation to the atom as a whole; their size 
is greatly exaggerated here.

including  some  that  are  unstable—and  thus  radioactive.  For  exam-
ple, while most carbon on Earth exists as the stable isotope carbon 12, 
with six protons and six neutrons, also present are small amounts of an 
unstable isotope, carbon 14, which has six protons and eight neutrons. 
Carbon 14 undergoes radioactive decay at a slow but steady rate, which 
allows archaeologists to estimate the age of organic material.

The atomic weight of an atom, or the molecular weight of a molecule, 
is its mass relative to that of a hydrogen atom. This is essentially equal to 
the number of protons plus neutrons that the atom or molecule contains, 
because the electrons are so light that they contribute almost nothing to 
the total mass. Thus the major isotope of carbon has an atomic weight 
of 12 and is written as 12C. The unstable carbon isotope just mentioned 
has an atomic weight of 14 and is written as 14C. The mass of an atom or 
a molecule is generally specified in daltons, one dalton being an atomic 
mass unit approximately equal to the mass of a hydrogen atom.

Atoms  are  so  small  that  it  is  hard  to  imagine  their  size.  An  individual 
carbon atom is roughly 0.2 nm in diameter, so that it would take about 
5 million of them, laid out in a straight line, to span a millimeter. One 
proton or neutron weighs approximately 1/(6 × 1023) gram. As hydrogen 
has only one proton—thus an atomic weight of 1—1 gram of hydrogen 
contains 6 × 1023 atoms. For carbon—which has six protons and six neu-
trons, and an atomic weight of 12—12 grams contain 6 × 1023 atoms. This 
huge number, called Avogadro’s number, allows us to relate everyday 
quantities of chemicals to numbers of individual atoms or molecules. If 
a substance has a molecular weight of M, M grams of the substance will 
contain 6 × 1023 molecules. This quantity is called one mole of the sub-
stance (Figure 2–3). The concept of mole is used widely in chemistry as 
a way to represent the number of molecules that are available to partici-
pate in chemical reactions. 

There are about 90 naturally occurring elements, each differing from the 
others in the number of protons and electrons in its atoms. Living organ-
isms, however, are made of only a small selection of these elements, four 
of which—carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O)—con-
stitute 96 % of an organism’s weight. This composition differs markedly 
from that of the nonliving inorganic environment on Earth (Figure 2–4) 
and is evidence of a distinctive type of chemistry. 

The Outermost Electrons Determine How Atoms Interact
To  understand  how  atoms  come  together  to  form  the  molecules  that 
make up living organisms, we have to pay special attention to the atoms’ 
electrons. Protons and neutrons are welded tightly to one another in an 
atom’s  nucleus,  and  they  change  partners  only  under  extreme  condi-
tions—during radioactive decay, for example, or in the interior of the sun 
or of a nuclear reactor. In living tissues, only the electrons of an atom 
undergo rearrangements. They form the accessible part of the atom and 
specify the rules of chemistry by which atoms combine to form molecules.

Electrons are in continuous motion around the nucleus, but motions on 
this submicroscopic scale obey different laws from those we are familiar 
with in everyday life. These laws dictate that electrons in an atom can 
exist  only  in  certain  discrete  regions  of  movement—roughly  speaking, 
in discrete orbits. Moreover, there is a strict limit to the number of elec-
trons that can be accommodated in an orbit of a given type, a so-called 
electron  shell.  The  electrons  closest  on  average  to  the  positive  nucleus 
are attracted most strongly to it and occupy the inner, most tightly bound 
shell. This innermost shell can hold a maximum of two electrons. The 
second shell is farther away from the nucleus, and can hold up to eight

Figure 2–4 The distribution of elements 
in the earth’s crust differs radically from 
that in a living organism. the abundance 
of each element is expressed here as a 
percentage of the total number of atoms 
present in a biological or geological sample, 
including water. thus, for example, more 
than 60% of the atoms in the human body 
are hydrogen atoms, and nearly 30% of the 
atoms in the earth’s crust are silicon atoms 
(Si). the relative abundance of elements is 
similar in all living things.

least one of these ancient water

electrons. The third shell can also hold up to eight electrons, which are 
even  less  tightly  bound.  The  fourth  and  fifth  shells  can  hold  18  elec-
trons each. Atoms with more than four shells are very rare in biological 
molecules.

The  arrangement  of  electrons  in  an  atom  is  most  stable  when  all  the 
electrons are in the most tightly bound states that are possible for them—
that is, when they occupy the innermost shells, closest to the nucleus. 
Therefore, with certain exceptions in the larger atoms, the electrons of an 
atom fill the shells in order—the first before the second, the second before 
the  third,  and  so  on.  An  atom  whose  outermost  shell  is  entirely  filled 
with electrons is especially stable and therefore chemically unreactive. 
Examples are helium with 2 electrons (atomic number 2), neon with 2 + 8 
electrons (atomic number 10), and argon with 2 + 8 + 8 electrons (atomic 
number  18);  these  are  all  inert  gases.  Hydrogen,  by  contrast,  has  only 
one electron, which leaves its outermost shell half-filled, so it is highly 
reactive. The atoms found in living organisms all have outermost shells 
that are incompletely filled, and they are therefore able to react with one 
another to form molecules (Figure 2–5).

ECB4 e2.04/2.04

Because an incompletely filled electron shell is less stable than one that 
is  completely  filled,  atoms  with  incomplete  outer  shells  have  a  strong 
tendency to interact with other atoms so as to either gain or lose enough 
electrons to achieve a completed outermost shell. This electron exchange 
can be achieved either by transferring electrons from one atom to another 
or by sharing electrons between two atoms. These two strategies gener-
ate the two types of chemical bonds that bind atoms to one another: an 
ionic bond is formed when electrons are donated by one atom to another, 
whereas a covalent bond is formed when two atoms share a pair of elec-
trons (Figure 2–6).

chemical Bonds

Figure 2–5 an element’s chemical 
reactivity depends on how its outermost 
electron shell is filled. all of the elements 
commonly found in living organisms have 
outermost shells that are not completely 
filled with electrons (red) and can thus 
participate in chemical reactions with other 
atoms. Inert gases (yellow), in contrast, have 
completely filled outermost shells and are 
thus chemically unreactive.

ECB4 e2.05/2.05

An H atom, which needs only one more electron to fill its only shell, gen-
erally  acquires  it  by  sharing—forming  one  covalent  bond  with  another 
atom.  The  other  most  common  elements  in  living  cells—C,  N,  and  O, 
which  have  an  incomplete  second  shell,  and  P  and  S,  which  have  an 
incomplete  third  shell  (see  Figure  2–5)—generally  share  electrons  and 
achieve a filled outer shell of eight electrons by forming several covalent 
bonds. The number of electrons an atom must acquire or lose (either by 
sharing or by transfer) to attain a filled outer shell determines the number 
of bonds the atom can make.

Because  the  state  of  the  outer  electron  shell  determines  the  chemical 
properties of an element, when the elements are listed in order of their 
atomic  number  we  see  a  periodic  recurrence  of  elements  with  similar 
properties: an element with, say, an incomplete second shell containing 
one electron will behave in much the same way as an element that has 
filled its second shell and has an incomplete third shell containing one 
electron. The metals, for example, have incomplete outer shells with just 
one or a few electrons, whereas, as we have just seen, the inert gases 
have full outer shells. This arrangement gives rise to the periodic table of 
the elements, outlined in Figure 2–7, which shows elements found in liv-
ing organisms highlighted in color.

B.  How many electrons does it 
have?
C.  How many additional electrons 
must it add to fill its outermost 
shell? How does this affect carbon’s 
chemical behavior?
D.  Carbon with an atomic weight of 
14 is radioactive. How does it differ 
in structure from nonradioactive 
carbon? How does this difference 
affect its chemical behavior?

Figure 2–6 atoms can attain a more 
stable arrangement of electrons in their 
outermost shell by interacting with one 
another. a covalent bond is formed when 
electrons are shared between atoms. an 
ionic bond is formed when electrons are 
transferred from one atom to the other. the 
two cases shown represent extremes; often, 
covalent bonds form with a partial transfer 
(unequal sharing of electrons), resulting in a 
polar covalent bond, as we discuss shortly.

Figure 2–7 The chemistry of life is 
predominantly the chemistry of lighter 
elements. When ordered by their atomic 
number into a periodic table, elements fall 
into groups that show similar properties 
based on the number of electrons each 
element possesses in its outer shell. atoms 
in the same vertical column must gain or 
lose the same number of electrons to attain 
a filled outer shell, and they thus behave 
similarly. thus, both magnesium (Mg) and 
calcium (ca) tend to give away the two 
electrons in their outer shells to form ionic 
bonds with atoms such as chlorine (cl) that 
need extra electrons to complete their outer 
shells.  
   the four elements highlighted in red 
constitute 99% of the total number of atoms 
present in the human body and about 96% 
of our total weight. an additional seven 
elements, highlighted in blue, together 
represent about 0.9% of the total number 
of atoms. Other elements, shown in green, 
are required in trace amounts by humans. 
It remains unclear whether those elements 
shown in yellow are essential in humans 
or not.

Covalent Bonds Form by the Sharing of Electrons
All of the characteristics of a cell depend on the molecules it contains. 
A molecule  is  a  cluster  of  atoms  held  together  by covalent  bonds,  in 
which electrons are shared rather than transferred between atoms. The 
shared electrons complete the outer shells of the interacting atoms. In the 
simplest possible molecule—a molecule of hydrogen (H2)—two H atoms, 
each with a single electron, share their electrons, thus filling their outer-
most shells. The shared electrons form a cloud of negative charge that 
is densest between the two positively charged nuclei. This electron den-
sity helps to hold the nuclei together by opposing the mutual repulsion 
between their positive charges that would otherwise force them apart. 
The attractive and repulsive forces are in balance when the nuclei are 
separated by a characteristic distance, called the bond length (Figure 2–8).

ECB4 e2.07/2.07

Whereas an H atom can form only a single covalent bond, the other com-
mon atoms that form covalent bonds in cells—O, N, S, and P, as well as 
the all-important C—can form more than one. The outermost shells of 
these atoms, as we have seen, can accommodate up to eight electrons, 
and they form covalent bonds with as many other atoms as necessary to 
reach this number. Oxygen, with six electrons in its outer shell, is most 
stable when it acquires two extra electrons by sharing with other atoms, 
and it therefore forms up to two covalent bonds. Nitrogen, with five outer 
electrons, forms a maximum of three covalent bonds, while carbon, with 
four outer electrons, forms up to four covalent bonds—thus sharing four 
pairs of electrons (see Figure 2–5).

When  one  atom  forms  covalent  bonds  with  several  others,  these  mul-
tiple  bonds  have  definite  orientations  in  space  relative  to  one  another, 
reflecting  the  orientations  of  the  orbits  of  the  shared  electrons.  Cova- 
lent bonds between multiple atoms are therefore characterized by spe-
cific bond angles, as well as by specific bond lengths and bond energies  
(Figure  2–9).  The  four  covalent  bonds  that  can  form  around  a  carbon

Figure 2–8 The hydrogen molecule is held together by a covalent 
bond. each hydrogen atom in isolation has a single electron, which 
means that its first (and only) electron shell is incompletely filled. By 
coming together, the two atoms are able to share their electrons, 
so that each obtains a completely filled first shell, with the shared 
electrons adopting modified orbits around the two nuclei. the covalent 
bond between the two atoms has a definite length—0.074 nm, which is 
the distance between the two nuclei. If the atoms were closer together, 
the positive nuclei would repel each other; if they were farther apart, 
they would not be able to share electrons as effectively.

ular tetrahedron. The precise orientation of the covalent bonds around 
carbon produces the three-dimensional geometry of organic molecules.

ECB4 e2.10/2.09

There Are Different Types of Covalent Bonds
Most covalent bonds involve the sharing of two electrons, one donated 
by each participating atom; these are called single bonds. Some covalent 
bonds, however, involve the sharing of more than one pair of electrons. 
Four electrons can be shared, for example, two coming from each par-
ticipating atom; such a bond is called a double bond. Double bonds are 
shorter and stronger than single bonds and have a characteristic effect 
on the three-dimensional geometry of molecules containing them. A sin-
gle covalent bond between two atoms generally allows the rotation of 
one part of a molecule relative to the other around the bond axis. A dou-
ble bond prevents such rotation, producing a more rigid and less flexible 
arrangement of atoms (Figure 2–10). This restriction has a major influ-
ence  on  the  three-dimensional  shape  of  many  macromolecules.  panel 
2–1  (pp.  66–67)  reviews  the  covalent  bonds  commonly  encountered  in 
biological molecules.

Some molecules contain atoms that share electrons in a way that pro-
duces bonds that are intermediate in character between single and double 
bonds. The highly stable benzene molecule, for example, is made up of 
a  ring  of  six  carbon  atoms  in  which  the  bonding  electrons  are  evenly 
distributed (although the arrangement is sometimes depicted as an alter-
nating sequence of single and double bonds, as shown in Panel 2–1).

When the atoms joined by a single covalent bond belong to different ele-
ments,  the  two  atoms  usually  attract  the  shared  electrons  to  different 
degrees. Covalent bonds in which the electrons are shared unequally in 
this way are known as polar covalent bonds. A polar structure (in the elec-
trical sense) is one in which the positive charge is concentrated toward 
one end of the molecule (the positive pole) and the negative charge is 
concentrated toward the other end (the negative pole). Oxygen and nitro-
gen atoms, for example, attract electrons relatively strongly, whereas an 
H atom attracts electrons relatively weakly (because of the relative dif-
ferences in the positive charges of the nuclei of C, O, N, and H). Thus the

QUESTION 2–3

ECB4 e2.12/2.11

Discuss whether the following 
statement is correct: “An ionic 
bond can, in principle, be thought 
of as a very polar covalent bond. 
Polar covalent bonds, then, fall 
somewhere between ionic bonds 
at one end of the spectrum and 
nonpolar covalent bonds at the 
other end.”

covalent bond between O and H, O–H, or between N and H, N–H, is polar 
(Figure 2–11). An atom of C and an atom of H, by contrast, attract elec-
trons more equally. Thus the bond between carbon and hydrogen, C–H, 
is relatively nonpolar.

Covalent Bonds Vary in Strength
We  have  already  seen  that  the  covalent  bond  between  two  atoms  has 
a  characteristic  length  that  depends  on  the  atoms  involved.  A  further 
crucial  property  of  any  chemical  bond  is  its  strength.  Bond  strength  is 
measured by the amount of energy that must be supplied to break the 
bond,  usually  expressed  in  units  of  either  kilocalories  per  mole  (kcal/
mole)  or  kilojoules  per  mole  (kJ/mole).  A  kilocalorie  is  the  amount  of 
energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1°C. Thus, if 
1 kilocalorie of energy must be supplied to break 6 × 1023 bonds of a spe-
cific type (that is, 1 mole of these bonds), then the strength of that bond is 
1 kcal/mole. One kilocalorie is equal to about 4.2 kJ, which is the unit of 
energy universally employed by physical scientists and, increasingly, by 
cell biologists as well. 

To  get  an  idea  of  what  bond  strengths  mean,  it  is  helpful  to  compare 
them with the average energies of the impacts that molecules continually 
undergo owing to collisions with other molecules in their environment—
their thermal, or heat, energy. Typical covalent bonds are stronger than 
these thermal energies by a factor of 100, so they are resistant to being 
pulled apart by thermal motions. In living organisms, they are normally 
broken only during specific chemical reactions that are carefully control-
led by highly specialized protein catalysts, called enzymes. 

When  water  is  present,  covalent  bonds  are  much  stronger  than  ionic 
bonds.  In  ionic  bonds,  electrons  are  transferred  rather  than  shared,  as 
we now discuss.

Ionic Bonds Form by the Gain and Loss of Electrons
Ionic bonds are usually formed between atoms that can attain a com-
pletely filled outer shell most easily by donating electrons to—or accepting 
electrons from—another atom, rather than by sharing them. For example, 
returning to Figure 2–5, we see that a sodium (Na) atom can achieve a 
filled outer shell by giving up the single electron in its third shell. By con-
trast, a chlorine (Cl) atom can complete its outer shell by gaining just one 
electron. Consequently, if a Na atom encounters a Cl atom, an electron 
can jump from the Na to the Cl, leaving both atoms with filled outer shells. 
The offspring of this marriage between sodium, a soft and intensely reac-
tive metal, and chlorine, a toxic green gas, is table salt (NaCl).

When  an  electron  jumps  from  Na  to  Cl,  both  atoms  become  electri-
cally charged ions. The Na atom that lost an electron now has one less 
electron than it has protons in its nucleus; it therefore has a net single 
positive charge (Na+). The Cl atom that gained an electron now has one 
more electron than it has protons and has a net single negative charge 
(Cl–). Because of their opposite charges, the Na+ and Cl– ions are attracted

What, if anything, is wrong with 
the following statement: “When 
NaCl is dissolved in water, the 
water molecules closest to the ions 
will tend to preferentially orient 
themselves so that their oxygen 
atoms face the sodium ions and 
face away from the chloride ions”?

to  each  other  and  are  thereby  held  together  by  an  ionic  bond  (Figure 
2–12a). Ions held together solely by ionic bonds are generally called salts 
rather than molecules. A NaCl crystal contains astronomical numbers of 
Na+ and Cl– packed together in a precise three-dimensional array with 
their opposite charges exactly balanced: a crystal only 1 mm across con-
tains about 2 × 1019 ions of each type (Figure 2–12B and C). 
Because of the favorable interaction between ions and water molecules 
(which are polar), many salts (including NaCl) are highly soluble in water. 
They  dissociate  into  individual  ions  (such  as  Na+  and  Cl–),  each  sur-
rounded by a group of water molecules. Positive ions are called cations, 
and negative ions are called anions. Small inorganic ions such as Na+, Cl–, 
K+, and Ca2+ play important parts in many biological processes, including 
the electrical activity of nerve cells, as we discuss in Chapter 12. 

Noncovalent Bonds Help Bring Molecules Together  
in Cells
In aqueous solution, ionic bonds are 10–100 times weaker than the cova-
lent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules. But this weakness has 
its place: much of biology depends on specific but transient interactions 
between one molecule and another. These associations are mediated by 
noncovalent bonds. Although noncovalent bonds are individually quite 
weak, their energies can sum to create an effective force between two 
molecules. 
The ionic bonds that hold together the Na+ and Cl– ions in a salt crystal 
(see Figure 2–12) are a form of noncovalent bond called an electrostatic 
attraction. Electrostatic attractions are strongest when the atoms involved 
are fully charged, as are Na+ and Cl–. But a weaker electrostatic attraction 
also occurs between molecules that contain polar covalent bonds (see 
Figure 2–11). Polar covalent bonds are thus extremely important in biol-
ogy because they allow molecules to interact through electrical forces. 
Any large molecule with many polar groups will have a pattern of par-
tial positive and negative charges on its surface. When such a molecule 
encounters  a  second  molecule  with  a  complementary  set  of  charges, 
the two will be attracted to each other by electrostatic attraction—even 

48 

ChapTer 2     chemical components of cells

though water greatly reduces the attractiveness of these charges in most 
biological settings. When present in large numbers, however, weak non-
covalent bonds on the surfaces of large molecules can promote strong 
and specific binding (Figure 2–13). 

Hydrogen Bonds Are Important Noncovalent Bonds For 
Many Biological Molecules
Water accounts for about 70% of a cell’s weight, and most intracellular 
reactions occur in an aqueous environment. Life on Earth is thought to 
have begun in the ocean. Thus the properties of water have put a perma-
nent stamp on the chemistry of living things. 
In each molecule of water (H2O), the two H atoms are linked to the O 
atom by covalent bonds. The two H–O bonds are highly polar because 
the O is strongly attractive for electrons, whereas the H is only weakly 
attractive. Consequently, there is an unequal distribution of electrons in 
a water molecule, with a preponderance of positive charge on the two H 
atoms and negative charge on the O (see Figure 2–11). When a positively 
charged region of one water molecule (that is, one of its H atoms) comes 
close to a negatively charged region (that is, the O) of a second water 
molecule,  the  electrical  attraction  between  them  can  establish  a  weak 
bond  called  a  hydrogen  bond  (Figure  2–14).  These  bonds  are  much 
weaker than covalent bonds and are easily broken by random thermal 
motions. Thus each bond lasts only an exceedingly short time. But the 
combined effect of many weak bonds is far from trivial. Each water mol-
ecule  can  form  hydrogen  bonds  through  its  two  H  atoms  to  two  other 
water  molecules,  producing  a  network  in  which  hydrogen  bonds  are 
being continually broken and formed. It is because of these interlocking 
hydrogen bonds that water at room temperature is a liquid—with a high 
boiling  point  and  high  surface  tension—and  not  a  gas.  Without  hydro-
gen bonds, life as we know it could not exist. The biologically significant 
properties of water are reviewed in panel 2–2 (pp. 68–69).

Hydrogen bonds are not limited to water. In general, a hydrogen bond 
can  form  whenever  a  positively  charged  H  atom  held  in  one  molecule 
by a polar covalent linkage comes close to a negatively charged atom—
typically an oxygen or a nitrogen—belonging to another molecule  (see 
Figure 2–14). Hydrogen bonds can also occur between different parts of 
a single large molecule, where they often help the molecule fold into a 
particular shape. The length and strength of hydrogen bonds and of ionic 
bonds are compared to those of covalent bonds in Table 2–1.

Molecules, such as alcohols, that contain polar bonds and that can form 
hydrogen bonds mix well with water. As mentioned previously, molecules 
carrying positive or negative charges (ions) likewise dissolve readily in 
water.  Such  molecules  are  termed  hydrophilic,  meaning  that  they  are 

Figure 2–13 a large molecule, such as 
a protein, can bind to another protein 
through complementary charges on the 
surface of each molecule. In the aqueous 
environment of a cell, the many individual 
electrostatic attractions shown would help 
the two proteins stay bound to each other.

“water-loving.” A large proportion of the molecules in the aqueous envi-
ronment of a cell fall into this category, including sugars, DNA, RNA, and 
a majority of proteins. Hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) molecules, by con-
trast, are uncharged and form few or no hydrogen bonds, and they do not 
dissolve in water. 

Hydrocarbons  are  important  hydrophobic  cell  constituents  (see  Panel 
2–1,  pp.  66–67).  In  these  molecules,  the  H  atoms  are  covalently  linked 
to C atoms by nonpolar bonds. Because the H atoms have almost no net 
positive charge, they cannot form effective hydrogen bonds to other mol-
ecules. This makes the hydrocarbon as a whole hydrophobic—a property 
that is exploited by cells, whose membranes are constructed largely from 
lipid  molecules  that  have  long  hydrocarbon  tails.  Because  lipids  do  not 
dissolve in water, they can form the thin membrane barriers that keep 
the aqueous interior of the cell separate from the surrounding aqueous 
environment, as we discuss later.

Some Polar Molecules Form Acids and Bases in Water
One of the simplest kinds of chemical reaction, and one that has profound 
significance  in  cells,  takes  place  when  a  molecule  possessing  a  highly 
polar covalent bond between a hydrogen and another atom dissolves in 
water. The hydrogen atom in such a bond has given up its electron almost 
entirely to the companion atom, so it exists as an almost naked positively 
charged hydrogen nucleus—in other words, a proton (H+). When the polar 
molecule  becomes  surrounded  by  water  molecules,  the  proton  will  be 
attracted to the partial negative charge on the oxygen atom of an adja-
cent water molecule (see Figure 2–11); this proton can dissociate from 
its  original  partner  and  associate  instead  with  the  oxygen  atom  of  the 
water molecule, generating a hydronium ion (H3O+) (Figure 2–15a). The 
reverse reaction also takes place very readily, so one has to imagine an 
equilibrium state in which billions of protons are constantly flitting to and 
fro between one molecule and another in an aqueous solution.

Substances that release protons when they dissolve in water, thus form-
ing H3O+, are termed acids. The higher the concentration of H3O+, the 
more acidic the solution. H3O+ is present even in pure water, at a concen-
tration of 10–7 M, as a result of the movement of protons from one water 
molecule to another (Figure 2–15B). By tradition, the H3O+ concentration

ChapTer 2     chemical components of cells

is usually referred to as the H+ concentration, even though most protons 
in an aqueous solution are present as H3O+. To avoid the use of unwieldy 
numbers, the concentration of H+ is expressed using a logarithmic scale 
called the pH scale, as illustrated in Panel 2–2. Pure water has a pH of 
7.0 and is thus neutral—that is, neither acidic (pH < 7) nor basic (pH > 7).

Acids are characterized as being strong or weak, depending on how read-
ily they give up their protons to water. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric 
acid (HCl), lose their protons easily. Acetic acid, on the other hand, is a 
weak acid because it holds on to its proton more tightly when dissolved 
in  water.  Many  of  the  acids  important  in  the  cell—such  as  molecules 
containing a carboxyl (COOH) group—are weak acids (see Panel 2–2, pp. 
68–69). Their tendency to give up a proton with some reluctance is a use-
ful characteristic, as it renders the molecules sensitive to changes in pH 
in the cell—a property that can be exploited to regulate function.

Because  protons  can  be  passed  readily  to  many  types  of  molecules  in 
cells, thus altering the molecules’ character, the H+ concentration inside 
a cell (the pH) must be closely controlled. Acids—especially weak acids—
will give up their protons more readily if the H+ concentration is low and 
will tend to accept them back if the concentration is high. 

The  opposite  of  an  acid  is  a  base,  which  includes  any  molecule  that 
accepts a proton when dissolved in water. Just as the defining property 
of an acid is that it raises the concentration of H3O+ ions by donating a 
proton to a water molecule, so the defining property of a base is that it 
raises  the  concentration  of  hydroxyl  (OH–)  ions  by  removing  a  proton 
from a water molecule. Thus sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is basic (the term 
alkaline is also used) because it dissociates in aqueous solution to form 
Na+ ions and OH– ions; because it does so readily, NaOH is called a strong 
base. Weak bases—which have a weak tendency to accept a proton from 
water—however, are actually more important in cells. Many biologically 
important weak bases contain an amino (NH2) group, which can gener-
ate OH– by taking a proton from water: –NH2 + H2O → –NH3
+ + OH– (see 
Panel 2–2, pp. 68–69). 
Because an OH– ion combines with a proton to form a water molecule, 
an  increase  in  the  OH–  concentration  forces  a  decrease  in  the  H+ con-
centration,  and  vice  versa.  A  pure  solution  of  water  thus  contains  an 
equal concentration (10–7 M) of both ions, rendering it neutral (pH 7). The 
interior of a cell is also kept close to neutral by the presence of buffers: 
mixtures of weak acids and bases that can adjust proton concentrations 
around pH 7 by releasing protons (acids) or taking them up (bases). This 
give-and-take keeps the pH of the cell relatively constant under a variety 
of conditions. 

SMALL MOLECULES IN CELLS
Having looked at the ways atoms combine to form small molecules and 
how these molecules behave in an aqueous environment, we now exam-
ine the main classes of small molecules found in cells and their biological 
roles. Amazingly, we will see that a few basic categories of molecules, 
formed from a handful of different elements, give rise to all the extraordi-
nary richness of form and behavior displayed by living things.

A Cell Is Formed from Carbon Compounds
If we disregard water, nearly all the molecules in a cell are based on car-
bon. Carbon is outstanding among all the elements in its ability to form 
large molecules; silicon—an element with the same number of electrons 
in its outer shell—is a poor second. Because a carbon atom is small and 

QUESTION 2–5

present in pure water at neutral pH  
(i.e., at pH = 7.0)? If so, how are 
they formed?
B. 
If they exist, what is the ratio 
of H3O+ ions to H2O molecules at 
neutral pH? (Hint: the molecular 
weight of water is 18, and 1 liter  
of water weighs 1 kg.)

has four electrons and four vacancies in its outer shell, it can form four 
covalent bonds with other atoms (see Figure 2–9). Most importantly, one 
carbon atom can join to other carbon atoms through highly stable cova-
lent C–C bonds to form chains and rings and hence generate large and 
complex molecules with no obvious upper limit to their size. The small 
and  large  carbon  compounds  made  by  cells  are  called  organic  mole-
cules. By contrast, all other molecules, including water, are said to be 
inorganic.
Certain  combinations  of  atoms,  such  as  the  methyl  (–CH3),  hydroxyl 
2–),  and 
(–OH),  carboxyl  (–COOH),  carbonyl  (–C=O),  phosphoryl  (–PO3
amino (–NH2) groups, occur repeatedly in organic molecules. Each such 
chemical group has distinct chemical and physical properties that influ-
ence the behavior of the molecule in which the group occurs, including 
whether the molecule tends to gain or lose protons and with which other 
molecules it will interact. Knowing these groups and their chemical prop-
erties  greatly  simplifies  understanding  the  chemistry  of  life.  The  most 
common chemical groups and some of their properties are summarized 
in Panel 2–1 (pp. 67–68).

Cells Contain Four Major Families of Small Organic 
Molecules
The  small  organic  molecules  of  the  cell  are  carbon  compounds  with 
molecular  weights  in  the  range  100–1000  that  contain  up  to  30  or  so 
carbon atoms. They are usually found free in solution in the cytosol and 
have many different roles. Some are used as monomer subunits to con-
struct  the  cell’s  giant  polymeric  macromolecules—its  proteins,  nucleic 
acids, and large polysaccharides. Others serve as energy sources, which 
are broken down and transformed into other small molecules in a maze 
of intracellular metabolic pathways. Many have more than one role in the 
cell—acting, for example, as both a potential subunit for a macromole-
cule and as an energy source. The small organic molecules are much less 
abundant than the organic macromolecules, accounting for only about 
one-tenth of the total mass of organic matter in a cell. As a rough guess, 
there may be a thousand different kinds of these small organic molecules 
in a typical animal cell.

All  organic  molecules  are  synthesized  from—and  are  broken  down 
into—the same set of simple compounds. Both their synthesis and their 
breakdown  occur  through  sequences  of  simple  chemical  changes  that 
are limited in variety and follow step-by-step rules. As a consequence, 
the compounds in a cell are chemically related, and most can be clas-
sified  into  a  small  number  of  distinct  families.  Broadly  speaking,  cells 
contain four major families of small organic molecules: the sugars, the 
fatty acids, the amino acids, and the nucleotides (Figure 2–16). Although 
many compounds present in cells do not fit into these categories, these 
four  families  of  small  organic  molecules,  together  with  the  macromol-
ecules made by linking them into long chains, account for a large fraction 
of a cell’s mass (Table 2–2).

organic molecules, including most of the 
macromolecules and other molecular 
assemblies of the cell. Some, like the sugars 
and the fatty acids, are also energy sources.

Sugars Are Both Energy Sources and Subunits of 
Polysaccharides
The  simplest  sugars—the  monosaccharides—are  compounds  with  the 
general formula (CH2O)n, where n is usually 3, 4, 5, or 6. Sugars, and the 
larger molecules made from them, are also called carbohydrates because 
of  this  simple  formula.  Glucose,  for  example,  has  the  formula  C6H12O6 
(Figure 2–17). The formula, however, does not fully define the molecule: 
the same set of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens can be joined together 
by covalent bonds in a variety of ways, creating structures with different 
shapes. Thus glucose can be converted into a different sugar—mannose 
or galactose—simply by switching the orientations of specific –OH groups 
relative to the rest of the molecule (panel 2–3, pp. 70–71). Each of these 
sugars, moreover, can exist in either of two forms, called the d-form and 
the l-form, which are mirror images of each other. Sets of molecules with 
the same chemical formula but different structures are called isomers, and 
mirror-image pairs of such molecules are called optical isomers. Isomers 
are  widespread  among  organic  molecules  in  general,  and  they  play  a

major part in generating the enormous variety of sugars. A more com-
plete outline of sugar structures and chemistry is presented in Panel 2–3.

Monosaccharides  can  be  linked  by  covalent  bonds—called  glycosidic 
bonds—to  form  larger  carbohydrates.  Two  monosaccharides  linked 
together  make  a  disaccharide,  such  as  sucrose,  which  is  composed  of 
a glucose and a fructose unit. Larger sugar polymers range from the oli-
gosaccharides  (trisaccharides,  tetrasaccharides,  and  so  on)  up  to  giant 
polysaccharides, which can contain thousands of monosaccharide units. 
In most cases, the prefix oligo- is used to refer to molecules made of a 
small  number  of  monomers,  typically  2  to  10  in  the  case  of  oligosac-
charides.  Polymers,  in  contrast,  can  contain  hundreds  or  thousands  of 
subunits.

The way sugars are linked together illustrates some common features of 
biochemical bond formation. A bond is formed between an –OH group 
on one sugar and an –OH group on another by a condensation reaction, 
in which a molecule of water is expelled as the bond is formed. The sub-
units in other biological polymers, including nucleic acids and proteins, 
are also linked by condensation reactions in which water is expelled. The 
bonds created by all of these condensation reactions can be broken by 
the reverse process of hydrolysis, in which a molecule of water is con-
sumed (Figure 2–18). 

Because each monosaccharide has several free hydroxyl groups that can 
form  a  link  to  another  monosaccharide  (or  to  some  other  compound), 
sugar polymers can be branched, and the number of possible polysac-
charide  structures  is  extremely  large.  For  this  reason,  it  is  much  more 
difficult to determine the arrangement of sugars in a complex polysac-
charide than to determine the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule or 
the amino acid sequence of a protein, in which each unit is joined to the 
next in exactly the same way.
The monosaccharide glucose has a central role as an energy source for 
cells.  It  is  broken  down  to  smaller  molecules  in  a  series  of  reactions, 
releasing  energy  that  the  cell  can  harness  to  do  useful  work,  as  we 
explain in Chapter 13. Cells use simple polysaccharides composed only 
of glucose units—principally glycogen in animals and starch in plants—as 
long-term stores of glucose, held in reserve for energy production. 

Sugars  do  not  function  exclusively  in  the  production  and  storage  of 
energy. They are also used, for example, to make mechanical supports. 
The most abundant organic molecule on Earth—the cellulose that forms 
plant cell walls—is a polysaccharide of glucose. Another extraordinarily 
abundant organic substance, the chitin of insect exoskeletons and fungal 
cell  walls,  is  also  a  polysaccharide—in  this  case,  a  linear  polymer  of  a 
sugar derivative called N-acetylglucosamine (see Panel 2–3, pp. 70–71). 
Other polysaccharides, which tend to be slippery when wet, are the main 
components of slime, mucus, and gristle.

Smaller  oligosaccharides  can  be  covalently  linked  to  proteins  to  form 
glycoproteins, or to lipids to form glycolipids (panel 2–4, pp. 72–73), which 
are  both  found  in  cell  membranes.  The  sugar  side  chains  attached  to 
glycoproteins  and  glycolipids  in  the  plasma  membrane  are  thought  to 
help protect the cell surface and often help cells adhere to one another. 
Differences in the types of cell-surface sugars form the molecular basis 
for different human blood groups.

Fatty Acid Chains Are Components of Cell Membranes
A fatty acid molecule, such as palmitic acid, has two chemically distinct 
regions.  One  is  a  long  hydrocarbon  chain,  which  is  hydrophobic  and  
not  very  reactive  chemically.  The  other  is  a  carboxyl  (–COOH)  group,

which  behaves  as  an  acid  (carboxylic  acid):  in  an  aqueous  solution, 
it  is  ionized  (–COO–),  extremely  hydrophilic,  and  chemically  reactive 
(Figure 2–19). Almost all the fatty acid molecules in a cell are covalently 
linked to other molecules by their carboxylic acid group (see Panel 2–4, 
pp. 72–73). Molecules—such as fatty acids—that possess both hydropho-
bic and hydrophilic regions are termed amphipathic.
ECB4 E2.18/2.18

The hydrocarbon tail of palmitic acid is saturated: it has no double bonds 
between its carbon atoms and contains the maximum possible number 
of  hydrogens.  Some  other  fatty  acids,  such  as  oleic  acid,  have  unsatu-
rated tails, with one or more double bonds along their length. The double 
bonds create kinks in the hydrocarbon tails, interfering with their abil-
ity to pack together, and it is the absence or presence of these double 
bonds that accounts for the difference between hard (saturated) and soft 
(polyunsaturated) margarine. Fatty acid tails are also found in cell mem-
branes,  where  the  tightness  of  their  packing  affects  the  fluidity  of  the 
membrane. The many different fatty acids found in cells differ only in the 
length of their hydrocarbon chains and in the number and position of the 
carbon–carbon double bonds (see Panel 2–4).

Fatty acids serve as a concentrated food reserve in cells: they can be bro-
ken down to produce about six times as much usable energy, weight for 
weight, as glucose. Fatty acids are stored in the cytoplasm of many cells 
in the form of fat droplets composed of triacylglycerol molecules—com-
pounds  made  of  three  fatty  acid  chains  covalently  joined  to  a  glycerol 
molecule (Figure 2–20, and see Panel 2–4). Triacylglycerols are the ani-
mal  fats  found  in  meat,  butter,  and  cream,  and  the  plant  oils  such  as 
corn  oil  and  olive  oil.  When  a  cell  needs  energy,  the  fatty  acid  chains 
can be released from triacylglycerols and broken down into two-carbon 
units.  These  two-carbon  units  are  identical  to  those  derived  from  the 
breakdown of glucose, and they enter the same energy-yielding reaction 
pathways, as described in Chapter 13. 

Fatty acids and their derivatives, including triacylglycerols, are examples 
of  lipids.  Lipids  are  loosely  defined  as  molecules  that  are  insoluble  in 
water but soluble in fat and organic solvents such as benzene. They typi-
cally contain long hydrocarbon chains, as in the fatty acids, or multiple 
linked aromatic rings, as in the steroids (see Panel 2–4).

The most unique function of fatty acids is in the formation of the lipid 
bilayer,  which  is  the  basis  for  all  cell  membranes.  These  thin  sheets,

in the form of droplets of triacylglycerol 
molecules made of three fatty acid chains

fats are found in meat and dairy products. 
(B) plant oils, such as corn oil, contain 
unsaturated fatty acids, which may be 
monounsaturated (containing one double 
bond) or polyunsaturated (containing 
multiple double bonds); this is why plant oils 
are liquid at room temperature. although 
fats are essential in the diet, saturated fats 
are not: they raise the concentration of 
cholesterol in the blood, which tends to 
clog the arteries, increasing the risk of heart 
attacks and strokes.

Figure 2–21 phospholipids can aggregate 
to form cell membranes. phospholipids 
are composed of two hydrophobic fatty 
acid tails joined to a hydrophilic head. In an 
aqueous environment, the hydrophobic tails

which enclose all cells and surround their internal organelles, are com-
posed largely of phospholipids (Figure 2–21). 

ECB4 e2.20/2.20

Like triacylglycerols, most phospholipids are constructed mainly from fatty 
acids and glycerol. In these phospholipids, however, the glycerol is joined 
to two fatty acid chains, rather than to three as in triacylglycerols. The 
remaining –OH group on the glycerol is linked to a hydrophilic phosphate 
group, which in turn is attached to a small hydrophilic compound such 
as choline (see Panel 2–4, pp. 72–73). With their two hydrophobic fatty 
acid  tails  and  a  hydrophilic,  phosphate-containing  head,  phospholipids 
are  strongly  amphipathic.  This  characteristic  amphipathic  composition 
and  shape  gives  them  different  physical  and  chemical  properties  from 
triacylglycerols,  which  are  predominantly  hydrophobic.  In  addition  to 
phospholipids,  cell  membranes  contain  differing  amounts  of  other  lip-
ids, including glycolipids, which contain one or more sugars instead of a 
phosphate group.

Thanks  to  their  amphipathic  nature,  phospholipids  readily  form  mem-
branes  in  water.  These  lipids  will  spread  over  the  surface  of  water  to 
form a monolayer, with their hydrophobic tails facing the air and their 
hydrophilic heads in contact with the water. Two such molecular layers 
can readily combine tail-to-tail in water to form the phospholipid sand-
wich that is the lipid bilayer (see Chapter 11).

Amino Acids Are the Subunits of Proteins
Amino  acids  are  small  organic  molecules  with  one  defining  property: 
they all possess a carboxylic acid group and an amino group, both linked 
to their α-carbon atom (Figure 2–22). Each amino acid also has a side 
chain attached to its α-carbon. The identity of this side chain is what dis-
tinguishes one amino acid from another.

QUESTION 2–6

Why do you suppose only l-amino 
acids and not a random mixture of 
the l- and d-forms of each amino 
acid are used to make proteins?

Figure 2–23 amino acids in a protein are held together by peptide 
bonds. the four amino acids shown are linked together by three 
peptide bonds, one of which is highlighted in yellow. One of the 
amino acids, glutamic acid, is shaded in gray. the amino acid side 
chains are shown in red. the two ends of a polypeptide chain are 
chemically distinct. One end, the N-terminus, is capped by an amino 
group, and the other, the c-terminus, ends in a carboxyl group. the 
sequence of amino acids in a protein is abbreviated using either a 
three-letter or a one-letter code, and the sequence is always read from 
the N-terminus (see panel 2–5, pp. 74–75). In the example given, the 
sequence is phe-Ser-Glu-Lys (or FSeK).

Cells use amino acids to build proteins—polymers made of amino acids, 
which are joined head-to-tail in a long chain that folds up into a three-
dimensional structure that is unique to each type of protein. The covalent 
bond  between  two  adjacent  amino  acids  in  a  protein  chain  is  called  a 
peptide bond; the chain of amino acids is also known as a polypeptide. 
Peptide bonds are formed by condensation reactions that link one amino 
acid to the next. Regardless of the specific amino acids from which it is 
made, the polypeptide always has an amino (NH2) group at one end—its 
N-terminus—and a carboxyl (COOH) group at its other end—its C-terminus 
(Figure 2–23). This difference in the two ends gives a polypeptide a defi-
nite directionality—a structural (as opposed to electrical) polarity.

Twenty types of amino acids are commonly found in proteins, each with a 
different side chain attached to the α-carbon atom (panel 2–5, pp. 74–75). 
The  same  20  amino  acids  are  found  in  all  proteins,  whether  they  hail 
from bacteria, plants, or animals. How this precise set of 20 amino acids 
came to be chosen is one of the mysteries surrounding the evolution of 
life; there is no obvious chemical reason why other amino acids could 
not have served just as well. But once the selection had been locked into 
place,  it  could  not  be  changed,  as  too  much  chemistry  had  evolved  to 
exploit it. Switching the types of amino acids used by cells would require 
a  living  creature  to  retool  its  entire  metabolism  to  cope  with  the  new 
building blocks.

Like sugars, all amino acids (except glycine) exist as optical isomers in d- 
and l-forms (see Panel 2–5). But only l-forms are ever found in proteins 
(although d-amino acids occur as part of bacterial cell walls and in some 
antibiotics, and d-serine is used as a signal molecule in the brain). The 
origin of this exclusive use of l-amino acids to make proteins is another 
evolutionary mystery.

The chemical versatility that the 20 standard amino acids provide is vitally 
important to the function of proteins. Five of the 20 amino acids—includ-
ing lysine and glutamic acid, shown in Figure 2–23—have side chains that 
can form ions in solution and can therefore carry a charge. The others 
are uncharged. Some amino acids are polar and hydrophilic, and some 
are nonpolar and hydrophobic (see Panel 2–5). As we discuss in Chapter 
4, the collective properties of the amino acid side chains underlie all the 
diverse and sophisticated functions of proteins.

Nucleotides Are the Subunits of DNA and RNA
DNA  and  RNA  are  built  from  subunits  called  nucleotides.  Nucleosides 
are made of a nitrogen-containing ring compound linked to a five-carbon 
sugar, which can be either ribose or deoxyribose (panel 2–6, pp. 76–77). 
Nucleotides are nucleosides that contain one or more phosphate groups 
attached to the sugar, and they come in two main forms: those containing 
ribose are known as ribonucleotides, and those containing deoxyribose 
are known as deoxyribonucleotides.

The nitrogen-containing rings of all these molecules are generally referred 
to as bases for historical reasons: under acidic conditions, they can each 
bind an H+ (proton) and thereby increase the concentration of OH– ions 
in aqueous solution. There is a strong family resemblance between the 
different  nucleotide  bases.  Cytosine  (C),  thymine  (T),  and  uracil  (U)  are 
called pyrimidines, because they all derive from a six-membered pyrimi-
dine ring; guanine (G) and adenine (A) are purines, which bear a second, 
five-membered ring fused to the six-membered ring. Each nucleotide is 
named after the base it contains (see Panel 2–6, pp. 76–77).

ECB4 e2.23/2.23

Nucleotides  can  act  as  short-term  carriers  of  chemical  energy.  Above 
all  others,  the  ribonucleotide  adenosine  triphosphate,  or  ATP  (Figure 
2–24),  participates  in  the  transfer  of  energy  in  hundreds  of  metabolic 
reactions. ATP is formed through reactions that are driven by the energy 
released by the breakdown of foodstuffs. Its three phosphates are linked 
in series by two phosphoanhydride bonds (see Panel 2–6). Rupture of these 
phosphate bonds releases large amounts of useful energy. The terminal 
phosphate group in particular is frequently split off by hydrolysis (Figure 
2–25). In many situations, transfer of this phosphate to other molecules 
releases energy that drives energy-requiring biosynthetic reactions. Other 
nucleotide derivatives serve as carriers for the transfer of other chemical 
groups. All of this is described in Chapter 3.

Nucleotides also have a fundamental role in the storage and retrieval of 
biological information. They serve as building blocks for the construction

either the energy-yielding oxidation of 
foodstuffs (in animal cells, fungi, and some 
bacteria) or the capture of light (in plant 
cells and some bacteria). the hydrolysis 
of atp provides the energy to drive many 
processes inside cells. together, the two 
reactions shown form the atp cycle.

Figure 2–26 a short length of one chain of a deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNa) molecule shows the covalent phosphodiester bonds 
linking four consecutive nucleotides. Because the bonds link specific 
carbon atoms in the sugar ring—known as the 5ʹ and 3ʹ atoms—one 
end of a polynucleotide chain, the 5ʹ end, has a free phosphate group 
and the other, the 3ʹ end, has a free hydroxyl group. One of the 
nucleotides, thymine (t), is shaded in gray, and one phosphodiester 
bond is highlighted in yellow. the linear sequence of nucleotides in a 
polynucleotide chain is commonly abbreviated by a one-letter code, 
and the sequence is always read from the 5ʹ end. In the example 
illustrated, the sequence is Gatc.

of nucleic acids—long polymers in which nucleotide subunits are linked 
by  the  formation  of  covalent  phosphodiester  bonds  between  the  phos-
phate  group  attached  to  the  sugar  of  one  nucleotide  and  a  hydroxyl 
group  on  the  sugar  of  the  next  nucleotide  (Figure  2–26).  Nucleic  acid 
chains  are  synthesized  from  energy-rich  nucleoside  triphosphates  by 
a  condensation  reaction  that  releases  inorganic  pyrophosphate  during 
phosphodiester bond formation (see Panel 2–6, pp. 76–77).

There  are  two  main  types  of  nucleic  acids,  which  differ  in  the  type  of 
sugar contained in their sugar–phosphate backbone. Those based on the 
sugar ribose are known as ribonucleic acids, or RNA, and contain the 
bases A, G, C, and U. Those based on deoxyribose (in which the hydroxyl 
at the 2ʹ position of the ribose carbon ring is replaced by a hydrogen) are 
known as deoxyribonucleic acids, or DNA, and contain the bases A, G, 
C, and T (T is chemically similar to the U in RNA; see Panel 2–6). RNA usu-
ally occurs in cells in the form of a single-stranded polynucleotide chain, 
but DNA is virtually always in the form of a double-stranded molecule: 
the DNA double helix is composed of two polynucleotide chains that run 
in opposite directions and are held together by hydrogen bonds between 
the bases of the two chains (panel 2–7, pp. 78–79).

The linear sequence of nucleotides in a DNA or an RNA molecule encodes 
genetic information. The two nucleic acids, however, have different roles 
in the cell. DNA, with its more stable, hydrogen-bonded helices, acts as 
a long-term repository for hereditary information, while single-stranded 
RNA  is  usually  a  more  transient  carrier  of  molecular  instructions.  The 
ability of the bases in different nucleic acid molecules to recognize and 
pair with each other by hydrogen-bonding (called base-pairing)—G with 
C, and A with either T or U—underlies all of heredity and evolution, as 
explained in Chapter 5.

MACROMOLECULES IN CELLS
On the basis of weight, macromolecules are by far the most abundant of 
the organic molecules in a living cell (Figure 2–27). They are the principal 
building blocks from which a cell is constructed and also the components 
that confer the most distinctive properties on living things. Intermediate 
in size and complexity between small organic molecules and organelles, 
macromolecules  are  constructed  simply  by  covalently  linking  small 
organic monomers, or subunits, into long chains, or polymers (Figure 
2–28  and  how  We  Know,  pp.  60–61).  Yet  they  have  many  unexpected 
properties that could not have been predicted from their simple constitu-
ents. For example, it took a long time to determine that the nucleic acids 
DNA  and  RNA  store  and  transmit  hereditary  information  (see  How  We 
Know, pp. 174–176). 

Proteins are especially versatile and perform thousands of distinct func-
tions in cells. Many proteins act as enzymes that catalyze the chemical

reactions that take place in cells. For example, an enzyme in plants, called 
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, converts CO2 to sugars, thereby creat-
ing most of the organic matter used by the rest of the living world. Other 
proteins are used to build structural components: tubulin, for example, 
self-assembles  to  make  the  cell’s  long,  stiff  microtubules  (see  Figure 
1–27B),  and  histone  proteins  assemble  into  spool-like  structures  that 
help wrap up the cell’s DNA in chromosomes. Yet other proteins, such 
as myosin, act as molecular motors to produce force and movement. We 
examine the molecular basis for many of these wide-ranging functions in 
later chapters. Here, we consider some of the general principles of mac-
romolecular chemistry that make all of these activities possible.

Each Macromolecule Contains a Specific Sequence of 
Subunits
Although  the  chemical  reactions  for  adding  subunits  to  each  polymer 
are  different  in  detail  for  proteins,  nucleic  acids,  and  polysaccharides, 
they share important features. Each polymer grows by the addition of a 
monomer onto one end of the polymer chain via a condensation reac-
tion, in which a molecule of water is lost with each subunit added (Figure 
2–29). In all cases, the reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes, which 
ensure that only the appropriate monomer is incorporated. 

The stepwise polymerization of monomers into a long chain is a simple 
way to manufacture a large, complex molecule, because the subunits are 
added by the same reaction performed over and over again by the same 
set of enzymes. In a sense, the process resembles the repetitive opera-
tion of a machine in a factory—with some important differences. First, 
apart from some of the polysaccharides, most macromolecules are made 
from a set of monomers that are slightly different from one another; for 
example,  proteins  are  constructed  from  20  different  amino  acids  (see 
Panel 2–5, pp. 74–75). Second, and most important, the polymer chain is 
not assembled at random from these subunits; instead the subunits are 
added in a particular order, or sequence. 

The  biological  functions  of  proteins,  nucleic  acids,  and  many  polysac-
charides are absolutely dependent on the particular sequence of subunits 
in  the  linear  chains.  By  varying  the  sequence  of  subunits,  the  cell  can 
make an enormous diversity of the polymeric molecules. Thus, for a pro-
tein chain 200 amino acids long, there are 20200 possible combinations 
(20  ×  20  ×  20  ×  20...  multiplied  200  times),  while  for  a  DNA  molecule

hOW We KNOW
WhaT are MaCrOMOLeCuLeS?

The  idea  that  proteins,  polysaccharides,  and  nucleic 
acids  are  large  molecules  that  are  constructed  from 
smaller  subunits,  linked  one  after  another  into  long 
molecular  chains,  may  seem  fairly  obvious  today.  But 
this  was  not  always  the  case.  In  the  early  part  of  the 
twentieth  century,  few  scientists  believed  in  the  exis-
tence  of  such  biological  polymers  built  from  repeating 
units held together by covalent bonds. The notion that 
such  “frighteningly  large”  macromolecules  could  be 
assembled from simple building blocks was considered 
“downright  shocking”  by  chemists  of  the  day.  Instead, 
they  thought  that  proteins  and  other  seemingly  large 
organic  molecules  were  simply  heterogeneous  aggre-
gates of small organic molecules held together by weak 
“association forces” (Figure 2–30).

The first hint that proteins and other organic polymers 
are large molecules came from observing their behav-
ior in solution. At the time, scientists were working with 
various proteins and carbohydrates derived from food-
stuffs  and  other  organic  materials—albumin  from  egg 
whites, casein from milk, collagen from gelatin, and cel-
lulose from wood. Their chemical compositions seemed 
simple enough: like other organic molecules, they con-
tained  carbon,  hydrogen,  oxygen,  and,  in  the  case  of 
proteins, nitrogen. But they behaved oddly in solution, 
showing, for example, an inability to pass through a fine 
filter. 

Why  these  molecules  misbehaved  in  solution  was  a 
puzzle. Were they really giant molecules, composed of 
an unusual number of covalently linked atoms? Or were 
they  more  like  a  colloidal  suspension  of  particles—a 
big, sticky hodgepodge of small organic molecules that 
associate only loosely?

(A)

(B)

Figure 2–30 What might an organic macromolecule look 
like? chemists in the early part of the twentieth century debated 
whether proteins, polysaccharides, and other apparently large 
organic molecules were (a) discrete particles made of an 
unusually large number of covalently linked atoms or (B) a loose 
aggregation of heterogeneous small organic molecules held 
together by weak forces.

ECB4 e2.29/2.29

One way to distinguish between the two possibilities was 
to determine the actual size of one of these molecules. 
If a protein such as albumin were made of molecules all 
identical in size, that would support the existence of true 
macromolecules. Conversely, if albumin were instead a 
miscellaneous  conglomeration  of  small  organic  mole-
cules,  these  should  show  a  whole  range  of  molecular 
sizes in solution. 

Unfortunately,  the  techniques  available  to  scientists  in 
the early 1900s were not ideal for measuring the sizes of 
such large molecules. Some chemists estimated a pro-
tein’s size by determining how much it would lower a 
solution’s freezing point; others measured the osmotic 
pressure of protein solutions. These methods were sus-
ceptible to experimental error and gave variable results. 
Different  techniques,  for  example,  suggested  that  cel-
lulose  was  anywhere  from  6000  to  103,000  daltons  in 
mass  (where  1  dalton  is  approximately  equal  to  the 
mass of a hydrogen atom). Such results helped to fuel 
the  hypothesis  that  carbohydrates  and  proteins  were 
loose  aggregates  of  small  molecules  rather  than  true 
macromolecules.

Many  scientists  simply  had  trouble  believing  that 
molecules  heavier  than  about  4000  daltons—the  larg-
est  compound  that  had  been  synthesized  by  organic 
chemists—could exist at all. Take hemoglobin, the oxy-
gen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Researchers tried 
to estimate its size by breaking it down into its chemical 
components.  In  addition  to  carbon,  hydrogen,  nitro-
gen, and oxygen, hemoglobin contains a small amount 
of  iron.  Working  out  the  percentages,  it  appeared  that 
hemoglobin had one atom of iron for every 712 atoms 
of  carbon—and  a  minimum  weight  of  16,700  daltons. 
Could a molecule with hundreds of carbon atoms in one 
long chain remain intact in a cell and perform specific 
functions? Emil Fischer, the organic chemist who deter-
mined  that  the  amino  acids  in  proteins  are  linked  by 
peptide  bonds,  thought  that  a  polypeptide  chain  could 
grow  no  longer  than  about  30  or  40  amino  acids.  As 
for  hemoglobin,  with  its  purported  700  carbon  atoms, 
the existence of molecular chains of such “truly fantas-
tic  lengths”  was  deemed  “very  improbable”  by  leading 
chemists.

Definitive resolution of the debate had to await the devel-
opment  of  new  techniques.  Convincing  evidence  that 
proteins  are  macromolecules  came  from  studies  using 
the ultracentrifuge—a device that uses centrifugal force 
to separate molecules according to their size (see Panel 
4–3, pp. 164–165). Theodor Svedberg, who designed the 
machine  in  1925,  performed  the  first  studies.  If  a  pro-
tein were really an aggregate of smaller molecules, he

reasoned,  it  would  appear  as  a  smear  of  molecules  of 
different  sizes  when  sedimented  in  an  ultracentrifuge. 
Using  hemoglobin  as  his  test  protein,  Svedberg  found 
that  the  centrifuged  sample  revealed  a  single,  sharp 
band  with  a  molecular  weight  of  68,000  daltons.  His 
results  strongly  supported  the  theory  that  proteins  are 
true macromolecules (Figure 2–31). 

Additional  evidence  continued  to  accumulate  through-
out  the  1930s,  as  other  researchers  began  to  prepare 
crystals of pure protein that could be studied by X-ray dif-
fraction. Only molecules with a uniform size and shape 
can  form  highly  ordered  crystals  and  diffract  X-rays  in 
such a way that their three-dimensional structure can be 
determined, as we discuss in Chapter 4. A heterogene-
ous suspension could not be studied in this way.

We now take it for granted that large macromolecules 
carry out many of the most important activities in living 
cells.  But  chemists  once  viewed  the  existence  of  such 
polymers with the same sort of skepticism that a zoolo-
gist might show on being told that “In Africa, there are 
elephants that are 100 meters long and 20 meters tall.” 
It took decades for researchers to master the techniques 
required to convince everyone that molecules ten times 
larger than anything they had ever encountered were a 
cornerstone of biology. As we shall see throughout this 
book,  such  a  labored  pathway  to  discovery  is  not  un- 
usual,  and  progress  in  science  is  often  driven  by 
advances in technology.

Figure 2–31 The ultracentrifuge helped to settle the debate about the nature of macromolecules. In the ultracentrifuge, 
centrifugal forces exceeding 500,000 times the force of gravity can be used to separate proteins or other large molecules. (a) In a 
modern ultracentrifuge, samples are loaded in a thin layer on top of a gradient of sucrose solution formed in a tube. the tube is placed 
in a metal rotor that is rotated at high speed. Molecules of different sizes sediment at different rates, and these molecules will therefore 
move as distinct bands in the sample tube. If hemoglobin were a loose aggregate of heterogeneous peptides, it would show a broad 
smear of sizes after centrifugation (top tube). Instead, it appears as a sharp band with a molecular weight of 68,000 daltons (bottom 
tube). although the ultracentrifuge is now a standard, almost mundane, fixture in most biochemistry laboratories, its construction was 
a huge technological challenge. the centrifuge rotor must be capable of spinning centrifuge tubes at high speeds for many hours 
at constant temperature and with high stability; otherwise convection occurs in the sedimenting solution and ruins the experiment. 
In 1926, Svedberg won the Nobel prize in chemistry for his ultracentrifuge design and its application to chemistry. (B) In his actual 
experiment, Svedberg filled a special tube in the centrifuge with a homogeneous solution of hemoglobin; by shining light through the 
tube, he then carefully monitored the moving boundary between the sedimenting protein molecules and the clear aqueous solution left 
behind (so-called boundary sedimentation). the more recently developed method shown in (a) is a form of band sedimentation.

10,000  nucleotides  long  (small  by  DNA  standards),  with  its  four  differ-
ent nucleotides, there are 410,000 different possibilities—an unimaginably 
large number. Thus the machinery of polymerization must be subject to a 
sensitive control that allows it to specify exactly which subunit should be 
added next to the growing polymer end. We discuss the mechanisms that 
specify the sequence of subunits in DNA, RNA, and protein molecules in 
Chapters 6 and 7. 

Noncovalent Bonds Specify the Precise Shape  
of a Macromolecule
Most of the single covalent bonds that link together the subunits in a mac-
romolecule allow rotation of the atoms they join; thus the polymer chain 
has  great  flexibility.  In  principle,  this  allows  a  single-chain  macromol-
ecule to adopt an almost unlimited number of shapes, or conformations, 
as the polymer chain writhes and rotates under the influence of random 
thermal energy. However, the shapes of most biological macromolecules 
are highly constrained because of weaker, noncovalent bonds that form 
between  different  parts  of  the  molecule.  In  many  cases,  these  weaker 
interactions ensure that the polymer chain preferentially adopts one par-
ticular  conformation,  determined  by  the  linear  sequence  of  monomers 
in  the  chain.  Most  protein  molecules  and  many  of  the  RNA  molecules 
found in cells fold tightly into one highly preferred conformation in this 
way  (Figure  2–32).  These  unique  conformations—shaped  by  evolu-
tion—determine the chemistry and activity of these macromolecules and 
dictate their interactions with other biological molecules.  

The noncovalent bonds important for the structure and function of mac-
romolecules include two types described earlier: electrostatic attractions 
and hydrogen bonds (see Panel 2–7, pp. 78–79). Electrostatic attractions, 
although  strong  on  their  own,  are  quite  weak  in  water  because  the 
charged or partially charged (polar) groups involved in the attraction are 
shielded by their interactions with water molecules and various inorganic 
ions present in the aqueous solution. Electrostatic attractions, however, 
are very important in biological systems. An enzyme that binds a posi-
tively charged substrate will often use a negatively charged amino acid 
side chain to guide its substrate into the proper position. 

Earlier, we described the importance of hydrogen bonds in determining 
the unique properties of water. They are also very important in the fold-
ing of a polypeptide chain and in holding together the two strands of a 
double-stranded DNA molecule.

QUESTION 2–8

In principle, there are many 
different, chemically diverse ways in 
which small molecules can be linked 
to form polymers. For example, the 
small molecule ethene (CH2=CH2) 
is used commercially to make the 
plastic polyethylene (...–CH2–CH2–
CH2–CH2–CH2–...). The individual 
subunits of the three major classes 
of biological macromolecules, 
however, are all linked by similar 
reaction mechanisms, i.e., by 
condensation reactions that 
eliminate water. Can you think of 
any benefits that this chemistry 
offers and why it might have been 
selected in evolution?

Figure 2–32 Most proteins and 
many rNa molecules fold into a 
particularly stable three-dimensional 
shape, or conformation. this shape is 
directed mostly by a multitude of weak, 
noncovalent intramolecular bonds. If the 
folded macromolecules are subjected to 
conditions that disrupt noncovalent bonds, 
the molecule becomes a flexible chain 
that loses both its conformation and its 
biological activity.

A  third  type  of  noncovalent  interaction  results  from  van  der  Waals 
attractions, which are a form of electrical attraction caused by fluctuating 
electric charges that arise whenever two atoms come within a very short 
distance of each other. Although van der Waals attractions are weaker 
than hydrogen bonds, in large numbers they play an important role in the 
attraction between macromolecules with complementary shapes. All of 
these noncovalent bonds are reviewed in Panel 2–7, pp. 78–79. 

Another important noncovalent interaction is created by the three-dimen-
sional structure of water, which forces together the hydrophobic portions 
of dissolved molecules in order to minimize their disruptive effect on the 
hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules (see Panel 2–7 and Panel 
2–2, pp. 68–69). This expulsion from the aqueous solution generates what 
is sometimes thought of as a fourth kind of noncovalent bond, called a 
hydrophobic interaction. Such interactions hold together phospholipid 
molecules in cell membranes, for example, and they also play a crucial 
part in the folding of protein molecules into a compact globular shape.

Noncovalent Bonds Allow a Macromolecule to Bind Other 
Selected Molecules
As  we  discussed  earlier,  although  noncovalent  bonds  are  individually 
weak, they can add up to create a strong attraction between two mol-
ecules  when  these  molecules  fit  together  very  closely,  like  a  hand  in  a 
glove,  so  that  many  noncovalent  bonds  can  occur  between  them  (see 
Panel 2–7). This form of molecular interaction provides for great specifi-
city in the binding of a macromolecule to other small and large molecules, 
because the multipoint contacts required for strong binding make it pos-
sible for a macromolecule to select just one of the many thousands of 
different molecules present inside a cell. Moreover, because the strength 
of  the  binding  depends  on  the  number  of  noncovalent  bonds  that  are 
formed, associations of almost any strength are possible.

Binding of this type makes it possible for proteins to function as enzymes. 
It can also stabilize associations between any macromolecules, as long 
as their surfaces match closely (Figure 2–33 and Movie 2.4). Noncovalent 
bonds thereby allow macromolecules to be used as building blocks for 
the formation of much larger structures. For example, proteins often bind

can assemble into large macromolecular complexes via noncovalent bonds. ribosomes are large macromolecular 
machines that synthesize proteins inside cells. each ribosome is composed of about 90 macromolecules (proteins 
and rNa molecules), and it is large enough to see in the electron microscope (see Figure 7–31). the subunits,

with multiple moving parts, carrying out such complex tasks as DNA rep-
lication and protein synthesis (Figure 2–34). In fact, noncovalent bonds 
account for a great deal of the complex chemistry that makes life possible.

COVALENT BONDS

A covalent bond forms when two atoms come very close

Atoms joined by two

This restriction has a

of many macromolecules.

Although a water molecule has an overall neutral charge (having the same 
number of electrons and protons), the electrons are asymmetrically distributed,
making the molecule polar. The oxygen nucleus draws electrons away from 
the hydrogen nuclei, leaving the hydrogen nuclei with a small net positive charge. 
The excess of electron density on the oxygen atom creates weakly negative 
regions at the other two corners of an imaginary tetrahedron. On these pages,
we review the chemical properties of water and see how water inﬂuences the
behavior of biological molecules.

Monosaccharides usually have the general formula (CH2O) n, where n can be 3, 4, 5, or 6, and have two or more hydroxyl groups. 
They either contain an aldehyde group (          ) and are called aldoses, or a ketone group (           ) and are called ketoses.

Many monosaccharides differ only in the spatial arrangement

78 paNeL 2–7  the prINcIpaL typeS OF WeaK NONcOVaLeNt BONDS

WEAK NONCOVALENT CHEMICAL BONDS

VAN DER WAALS ATTRACTIONS

Organic molecules can interact with other molecules through 
three types of short-range attractive forces known as 
noncovalent bonds: van der Waals attractions, electrostatic 
attractions, and hydrogen bonds. The repulsion of 
hydrophobic groups from water is also important for these 
interactions and for the folding of biological macromolecules.

weak
noncovalent
bond

Weak noncovalent bonds have less than 1/20 the strength of
a strong covalent bond. They are strong enough to provide 
tight binding only when many of them are formed 
simultaneously.

HYDROGEN BONDS
As already described for water (see Panel 2–2, pp. 68–69), 
hydrogen bonds form when a hydrogen atom is 
“sandwiched” between two electron-attracting atoms 
(usually oxygen or nitrogen).

Hydrogen bonds are strongest when the three atoms are 
in a straight line:

  together in a folded protein.

If two atoms are too close together they repel each other 
very strongly. For this reason, an atom can often be 
treated as a sphere with a ﬁxed radius. The characteristic
“size” for each atom is speciﬁed by a unique van der 
Waals radius. The contact distance between any two 
noncovalently bonded atoms is the sum of their van der 
Waals radii.

C

N

O

0.12 nm

  At very short distances, any two atoms show a weak 
bonding interaction due to their ﬂuctuating electrical 
charges. The two atoms will be attracted to each other 
in this way until the distance between their nuclei is 
approximately equal to the sum of their van der Waals 
radii. Although they are individually very weak, such 
van der Waals attractions can become important when 
two macromolecular surfaces ﬁt very close together, 
because many atoms are involved.
  Note that when two atoms form a covalent bond, the 
centers of the two atoms (the two atomic nuclei) are 
much closer together than the sum of the two van der 
Waals radii. Thus,

HYDROGEN BONDS IN WATER
Any two atoms that can form hydrogen bonds to each other
can alternatively form hydrogen bonds to water molecules.
Because of this competition with water molecules, the
hydrogen bonds formed in water between two peptide bonds,
for example, are relatively weak.

    Two bases, G and C, are hydrogen-bonded in a DNA double helix.

ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTIONS 

Attractive interactions occur both between 
fully charged groups (ionic bond) and between
partially charged groups on polar molecules.

δ+

δ–

The force of attraction between the two partial
charges, δ+ and δ–, falls off rapidly as the 
distance between the charges increases.

In the absence of water, ionic bonds are very strong. 
They are responsible for the strength of such 
minerals as marble and agate, and for crystal 
formation in common table salt, NaCl.

ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTIONS IN

Despite being weakened by water and inorganic

Water forces hydrophobic groups together
in order to minimize their disruptive
effects on the water network formed by the H bonds
between water molecules. Hydrophobic groups 
held together in this way are sometimes said
to be held together by “hydrophobic
bonds,” even though the attraction is
actually caused by a repulsion from water.

Energy, Catalysis, and 
Biosynthesis

One  property  above  all  makes  living  things  seem  almost  miraculously 
different from nonliving matter: they create and maintain order in a uni-
verse that is tending always toward greater disorder. To accomplish this 
remarkable feat, the cells in a living organism must carry out a never-
ending  stream  of  chemical  reactions  that  produce  the  molecules  the 
organism requires to meet its metabolic needs. In some of these reac-
tions,  small  organic  molecules—amino  acids,  sugars,  nucleotides,  and 
lipids—are taken apart or modified to supply the many other small mol-
ecules  that  the  cell  requires.  In  other  reactions,  these  small  molecules 
are used to construct an enormously diverse range of larger molecules, 
including  the  proteins,  nucleic  acids,  and  other  macromolecules  that 
endow living systems with all of their most distinctive properties. Each 
cell can be viewed as a tiny chemical factory, performing many millions 
of these reactions every second. 

To  carry  out  the  tremendous  number  of  chemical  reactions  needed  to 
sustain it, a living organism requires both a source of atoms in the form 
of food molecules and a source of energy. The atoms and the energy must 
both come, ultimately, from the nonliving environment. In this chapter, 
we discuss why cells require energy, and how they use energy and atoms 
from  their  environment  to  create  the  molecular  order  that  makes  life 
possible. 

Most of the chemical reactions that cells perform would normally occur 
only at temperatures that are much higher than those inside a cell. Each 
reaction therefore requires a major boost in chemical reactivity to enable 
it to proceed rapidly within the cell. This boost is provided by specialized 
proteins called enzymes, each of which accelerates, or catalyzes, just one

of the many possible kinds of reactions that a particular molecule might 
undergo.  These  enzyme-catalyzed  reactions  are  usually  connected  in 
series, so that the product of one reaction becomes the starting material 
for the next (Figure 3–1). The long linear reaction pathways, or metabolic 
pathways, that result are in turn linked to one another, forming a complex 
web of interconnected reactions. 

ECB4 e3.01/3.01

Rather than being an inconvenience, the necessity for catalysis is a ben-
efit,  as  it  allows  the  cell  to  precisely  control  its  metabolism—the  sum 
total of all the chemical reactions it needs to carry out to survive, grow, 
and reproduce. This control is central to the chemistry of life.

Two opposing streams of chemical reactions occur in cells, the catabolic 
pathways and the anabolic pathways. The catabolic pathways (catabo-
lism) break down foodstuffs into smaller molecules, thereby generating 
both a useful form of energy for the cell and some of the small molecules 
that the cell needs as building blocks. The anabolic, or biosynthetic, path-
ways (anabolism) use the energy harnessed by catabolism to drive the 
synthesis of the many molecules that form the cell. Together, these two 
sets of reactions constitute the metabolism of the cell (Figure 3–2).

The details regarding the individual reactions that comprise cell metabo-
lism  are  part  of  the  subject  matter  of  biochemistry,  and  they  need  not 
concern us here. But the general principles by which cells obtain energy 
from their environment and use it to create order are central to cell biol-
ogy.  We  begin  this  chapter  with  a  discussion  of  why  a  constant  input 
of  energy  is  needed  to  sustain  living  organisms.  We  then  discuss  how 
enzymes catalyze the reactions that produce biological order. Finally, we 
describe the molecules that carry the energy that makes life possible.

The Use of energy by Cells
Nonliving things left to themselves eventually become disordered: build-
ings  crumble  and  dead  organisms  decay.  Living  cells,  by  contrast,  not 
only maintain, but actually generate order at every level, from the large-
scale structure of a butterfly or a flower down to the organization of the 
molecules that make up these organisms (Figure 3–3). This property of 
life  is  made  possible  by  elaborate  molecular  mechanisms  that  extract 
energy  from  the  environment  and  convert  it  into  the  energy  stored  in 
chemical bonds. Biological structures are therefore able to maintain their 
form,  even  though  the  materials  of  which  they  are  made  are  continu-
ally being broken down, replaced, and recycled. Your body has the same 
basic structure it had 10 years ago, even though you now contain atoms 
that, for the most part, were not in your body then.

biological order is Made Possible by the release of  
heat energy from Cells
The universal tendency of things to become disordered is expressed in a 
fundamental law of physics, the second law of thermodynamics. This law 
states that, in the universe or in any isolated system (a collection of mat-
ter that is completely isolated from the rest of the universe), the degree 
of  disorder  can  only  increase.  The  second  law  of  thermodynamics  has 
such profound implications for living things that it is worth restating in 
several ways.

We  can  express  the  second  law  in  terms  of  probability  by  stating  that 
systems  will  change  spontaneously  toward  those  arrangements  that  have 
the greatest probability. Consider a box of 100 coins all lying heads up. A 
series of events that disturbs the box will tend to move the arrangement 
toward a mixture of 50 heads and 50 tails. The reason is simple: there are 
a huge number of possible arrangements of the individual coins that can 
achieve the 50–50 result, but only one possible arrangement that keeps 
them all oriented heads up. Because the 50–50 mixture accommodates a 
greater number of possibilities and places fewer constraints on the ori-
entation of each individual coin, we say that it is more “disordered.” For 
the same reason, one’s living space will become increasingly disordered 
without an intentional effort to keep it organized. Movement toward dis-
order is a spontaneous process, requiring a periodic input of energy to 
reverse it (Figure 3–4).

ECB4 m2.33/3.03

The measure of a system’s disorder is called the entropy of the system, 
and the greater the disorder, the greater the entropy. Thus another way 
to  express  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics  is  to  say  that  systems 
will  change  spontaneously  toward  arrangements  with  greater  entropy. 
Living cells—by surviving, growing, and forming complex communities 
and  even  whole  organisms—generate  order  and  thus  might  appear  to 
defy the second law of thermodynamics. This is not the case, however, 

ORGANIZED EFFORT REQUIRING ENERGY INPUT

Figure 3–3 Biological structures are 
highly ordered. Well-defined, ornate, and 
beautiful spatial patterns can be found 
at every level of organization in living 
organisms. In order of increasing size:  
(a) protein molecules in the coat of a virus 
(a parasite that, although not technically 
alive, contains the same types of molecules 
as those found in living cells); (B) the regular 
array of microtubules seen in a cross section 
of a sperm tail; (c) surface contours of a 
pollen grain (a single cell); (D) cross section 
of a fern stem, showing the patterned 
arrangement of cells; and (e) flower with a

of cells. (a, courtesy of robert Grant,

Figure 3–4 The spontaneous tendency 
toward disorder is an everyday 
experience. reversing this natural tendency 
toward disorder requires an intentional 
effort and an input of energy. In fact, from 
the second law of thermodynamics, we 
can be certain that the human intervention 
required will release enough heat to the 
environment to more than compensate for 
the reestablishment of order in this room.

Figure 3–5 Living cells do not defy the 
second law of thermodynamics. In the 
diagram on the left, the molecules of both 
the cell and the rest of the universe (the 
environment) are depicted in a relatively 
disordered state. In the diagram on the 
right, the cell has taken in energy from food 
molecules and released heat by carrying out 
a reaction that orders the molecules that the 
cell contains. Because the heat increases 
the disorder in the environment around the 
cell—as depicted by the longer, jagged red 
arrows, which represent increased thermal 
motion, and the distorted molecules, 
which indicate enhanced molecular 
vibration and rotation—the second law of 
thermodynamics is satisfied, even as the cell 
grows and constructs larger molecules.

because a cell is not an isolated system. Rather, it takes in energy from 
its environment—in the form of food, inorganic molecules, or photons of 
light from the sun—and it then uses this energy to generate order within 
itself, forging new chemical bonds and building large macromolecules. 
In the course of performing the chemical reactions that generate order, 
some energy is lost in the form of heat. Heat is energy in its most disor-
dered form—the random jostling of molecules (analogous to the random 
jostling of the coins in the box). Because the cell is not an isolated sys-
tem, the heat energy that its reactions generate is quickly dispersed into 
the cell’s surroundings. There, the heat increases the intensity of the ther-
mal motions of nearby molecules, thereby increasing the entropy of the 
environment (Figure 3–5).

The  amount  of  heat  released  by  a  cell  must  be  great  enough  that  the 
increased order generated inside the cell is more than compensated for 
by the increased disorder generated in the environment. Only in this case 
is the second law of thermodynamics satisfied, because the total entropy 
of the system—that of the cell plus its environment—increases as a result 
of the chemical reactions inside the cell.

Cells Can Convert energy from one form to another
According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or 
destroyed—but it can be converted from one form to another (Figure 3–6). 
Cells take advantage of this law of thermodynamics, for example, when 
they  convert  the  energy  from  sunlight  into  the  energy  in  the  chemical 
bonds of sugars and other small organic molecules during photosynthe-
sis. Although chemical reactions that power such energy conversions can 
change how much energy is present in one form or another, the first law 
tells us that the total amount of energy in the universe must always be 
the same. 

When  an  animal  cell  breaks  down  foodstuffs,  some  of  the  energy  in 
the  chemical  bonds  in  the  food  molecules  (chemical-bond  energy)  is 
converted into the thermal motion of molecules (heat energy). This con-
version  of  chemical  energy  into  heat  energy  causes  the  universe  as  a 
whole to become more disordered—as required by the second law of ther-
modynamics. But the cell cannot derive any benefit from the heat energy 
it  produces  unless  the  heat-generating  reactions  are  directly  linked  to 
processes  that  maintain  molecular  order  inside  the  cell.  It  is  the  tight 
coupling of heat production to an increase in order that distinguishes the 
metabolism of a cell from the wasteful burning of fuel in a fire. Later in 
this chapter, we illustrate how this coupling occurs. For the moment, it is

sufficient to recognize that—by directly linking the “burning” of food mol-

ECB4 e3.06/3.06

Photosynthetic organisms Use sunlight to synthesize 
organic Molecules
All animals live on energy stored in the chemical bonds of organic mol-
ecules, which they take in as food. These food molecules also provide the 
atoms that animals need to construct new living matter. Some animals 
obtain their food by eating other animals, others by eating plants. Plants, 
by contrast, obtain their energy directly from sunlight. Thus, the energy 
animals  obtain  by  eating  plants—or  by  eating  animals  that  have  eaten 
plants—ultimately comes from the sun (Figure 3–7). 

Solar energy enters the living world through photosynthesis, a process 
that converts the electromagnetic energy in sunlight into chemical-bond 
energy in cells. Photosynthetic organisms—including plants, algae, and

are interconvertible, but the total amount 
of energy must be conserved. In (a), we

released when it hits the floor. In (B), the 
large amount of chemical-bond energy 
released when water (h2O) is formed from 
h2 and O2 is initially converted to very 
rapid thermal motions in the two new h2O 
molecules; however, collisions with other 
h2O molecules almost instantaneously 
spread this kinetic energy evenly throughout 
the surroundings (heat transfer), making 
the new h2O molecules indistinguishable 
from all the rest. (c) cells can convert 
chemical-bond energy into kinetic energy 
to drive, for example, molecular motor 
proteins; however, this occurs without the 
intermediate conversion to electrical energy 
that a man-made appliance such as this fan 
requires. (D) Some cells can also harvest 
the energy from sunlight to form chemical 
bonds via photosynthesis.

microorganisms through photosynthesis,

macromolecules—the  proteins,  nucleic  acids,  polysaccharides,  and  lip-
ECB4 e3.08/3.08
ids—that form the plant. 

We  describe  the  elegant  mechanisms  that  underlie  photosynthesis  in 
detail in Chapter 14. Generally speaking, the reactions of photosynthe-
sis  take  place  in  two  stages.  In  the  first  stage,  energy  from  sunlight  is 
captured and transiently stored as chemical-bond energy in specialized 
molecules called activated carriers, which we discuss in more detail later 
in the chapter. All of the oxygen (O2) in the air we breathe is generated by 
the splitting of water molecules during this first stage of photosynthesis. 

In the second stage, the activated carriers are used to help drive a carbon-
fixation process, in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide 
gas (CO2). In this way, photosynthesis generates an essential source of 
stored chemical-bond energy and other organic materials—for the plant 
itself and for any animals that eat it. The two stages of photosynthesis are 
summarized in Figure 3–8.

Cells obtain energy by the oxidation of organic 
Molecules
All  animal  and  plant  cells  require  the  chemical  energy  stored  in  the 
chemical bonds of organic molecules—either the sugars that a plant has 
produced by photosynthesis as food for itself or the mixture of large and 
small  molecules  that  an  animal  has  eaten.  To  use  this  energy  to  live, 
grow, and reproduce, organisms must extract it in a usable form. In both 
plants and animals, energy is extracted from food molecules by a process 
of gradual oxidation, or controlled burning. 

Earth’s atmosphere is about 21% oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, the 
most energetically stable form of carbon is CO2 and that of hydrogen is 
H2O. A cell is therefore able to obtain energy from sugars or other organic 
molecules  by  allowing  the  carbon  and  hydrogen  atoms  in  these  mole-
cules to combine with oxygen—that is, become oxidized—to produce CO2 
and H2O, respectively—a process known as cellular respiration.
Photosynthesis  and  cellular  respiration  are  complementary  processes 
(Figure 3–9). This means that the transactions between plants and ani-
mals  are  not  all  one  way.  Plants,  animals,  and  microorganisms  have 
existed  together  on  this  planet  for  so  long  that  they  have  become  an 
essential  part  of  each  other’s  environments.  The  oxygen  released  by 
photosynthesis  is  consumed  by  nearly  all  organisms  for  the  oxidative 
breakdown of organic molecules. And some of the CO2 molecules that 
today  are  incorporated  into  organic  molecules  by  photosynthesis  in  a 
green  leaf  were  released  yesterday  into  the  atmosphere  by  the  respi-
ration  of  an  animal,  a  fungus,  or  the  plant  itself,  or  by  the  burning  of 

the Use of energy by cells

Figure 3–9 photosynthesis and cellular 
respiration are complementary processes 
in the living world. the left side of the 
diagram shows how photosynthesis—
carried out by plants and photosynthetic 
microorganisms—uses the energy of 
sunlight to produce sugars and other 
organic molecules from the carbon 
atoms in cO2 in the atmosphere. In 
turn, these molecules serve as food for 
other organisms. the right side of the 
diagram shows how cellular respiration 
in most organisms—including plants and 
photosynthetic microorganisms—uses O2 
to oxidize food molecules, releasing the 
same carbon atoms in the form of cO2 
back to the atmosphere. In the process, 
the organisms obtain the useful chemical-
bond energy that they need to survive. 
the first cells on earth are thought to have 
been capable of neither photosynthesis nor 
cellular respiration (discussed in chapter 
14). however, photosynthesis must have 
preceded respiration on the earth, because 
there is strong evidence that billions of 
years of photosynthesis were required to 
release enough O2 to create an atmosphere 
that could support respiration.

ECB4 e3.09/3.09

oxidation and reduction involve electron Transfers
The cell does not oxidize organic molecules in one step, as occurs when 
organic material is burned in a fire. Through the use of enzyme catalysts, 
metabolism directs the molecules through a large number of reactions, 
few of which actually involve the direct addition of oxygen. Thus, before 
we consider some of these reactions, we should explain what is meant 
by oxidation.

The term oxidation literally means the addition of oxygen atoms to a mol-
ecule. More generally, though, oxidation is said to occur in any reaction 
in which electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Oxidation, 
in this sense, refers to the removal of electrons from an atom. The con-
verse reaction, called reduction, involves the addition of electrons to an 
atom. Thus, Fe2+ is oxidized when it loses an electron to become Fe3+, 
whereas a chlorine atom is reduced when it gains an electron to become 
Cl–.  Because  the  number  of  electrons  is  conserved  in  a  chemical  reac-
tion (there is no net loss or gain), oxidation and reduction always occur 
simultaneously: that is, if one molecule gains an electron in a reaction 
(reduction), a second molecule must lose the electron (oxidation). When 
a sugar molecule is oxidized to CO2 and H2O, for example, the O2 mol-
ecules involved in forming H2O gain electrons and thus are said to have 
been reduced.

The terms oxidation and reduction apply even when there is only a partial 
shift of electrons between atoms linked by a covalent bond. When a car-
bon atom becomes covalently bonded to an atom with a strong affinity 
for electrons—oxygen, chlorine, or sulfur, for example—it gives up more

Figure 3–11 Oxidation and reduction involve a shift in the balance of electrons. 
(a) When two atoms form a polar covalent bond (as discussed in chapter 2, p. 44), the 
atom that ends up with a greater share of electrons (represented by the blue clouds) 
is said to be reduced, while the other atom, with a lesser share of electrons, is said to  
be oxidized. the reduced atom has acquired a partial negative charge (δ–); conversely, 
the oxidized atom has acquired a partial positive charge (δ+), as the positive charge 
on the atomic nucleus now exceeds the total charge of the electrons surrounding it.  
(B) a simple reduced carbon compound, such as methane, can be oxidized in a stepwise 
fashion by the successive replacement of its covalently bonded hydrogen atoms with 
oxygen atoms. With each step, electrons are shifted away from the carbon, and the 
carbon atom becomes progressively more oxidized. Moving in the opposite direction, 
carbon dioxide becomes progressively more reduced as its oxygen atoms are replaced 
by hydrogens to yield methane.

than  its  equal  share  of  electrons  and  forms  a  polar  covalent  bond.  The 
positive charge of the carbon nucleus now slightly exceeds the negative 
charge of its electrons, so that the carbon atom acquires a partial positive 
charge (δ+) and is said to be oxidized. Conversely, the carbon atom in a 
C–H bond has somewhat more than its share of electrons; it acquires a 
partial negative charge (δ–), and so is said to be reduced (Figure 3–11a).
When a molecule in a cell picks up an electron (e–), it often picks up a 
proton  (H+)  at  the  same  time  (protons  being  freely  available  in  water). 
The net effect in this case is to add a hydrogen atom to the molecule:

ECB4 e3.11/3.11

A + e– + H+ → AH

Even  though  a  proton  plus  an  electron  is  involved  (instead  of  just  an 
electron), such hydrogenation reactions are reductions, and the reverse, 
dehydrogenation, reactions are oxidations. An easy way to tell whether an 
organic molecule is being oxidized or reduced is to count its C–H bonds: 
reduction occurs when the number of C–H bonds increases, whereas oxi-
dation occurs when the number of C–H bonds decreases (Figure 3–11B). 

As we will see later in this chapter—and again in Chapter 13—cells use 
enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of organic molecules in small steps, 
through a sequence of reactions that allows energy to be harvested in 
useful forms.

free energy and CaTalysis
Enzymes, like cells, obey the second law of thermodynamics. Although 
they can speed up energetically favorable reactions—those that produce 
disorder in the universe—enzymes cannot by themselves force energeti-
cally  unfavorable  reactions  to  occur.  Cells,  however,  must  do  just  that 
in order to grow and divide—or just to survive. They must build highly 
ordered and energy-rich molecules from small and simple ones—a proc-
ess that requires an input of energy.

To  understand  how  enzymes  promote  catalysis—the  acceleration  of 
the  specific  chemical  reactions  needed  to  sustain  life—we  first  need  to 
examine  the  energetics  involved.  In  this  section,  we  consider  how  the 
free energy of molecules contributes to their chemistry, and we see how 

free-energy changes—which reflect how much total disorder is generated 
in the universe by a reaction—influence whether and how the reaction 
will proceed. We then discuss how enzymes lower the activation energy 
needed to initiate reactions in the cell. And we describe how enzymes 
can exploit differences in the free-energy changes of different reactions 
to drive the energetically unfavorable reactions that produce biological 
order. Such enzyme-assisted catalysis is crucial for cells: without it, life 
could not exist. 

Chemical reactions Proceed in the direction that Causes 
a loss of free energy
Paper  burns  readily,  releasing  into  the  atmosphere  water  and  carbon 
dioxide as gases, while simultaneously releasing energy as heat:

paper + O2 → smoke + ashes + heat + CO2 + H2O

This reaction occurs in only one direction: smoke and ashes never spon-
taneously gather carbon dioxide and water from the heated atmosphere 
and reconstitute themselves into paper. When paper burns, much of its 
chemical  energy  is  dissipated  as  heat:  it  is  not  lost  from  the  universe, 
since energy can never be created or destroyed; instead, it is irretrievably 
dispersed  in  the  chaotic  random  thermal  motions  of  molecules.  At  the 
same time, the atoms and molecules of the paper become dispersed and 
disordered. In the language of thermodynamics, there has been a release 
of free energy—that is, energy that can be harnessed to do work or drive 
chemical reactions. This release reflects a loss of orderliness in the way 
the energy and molecules had been stored in the paper. We will discuss 
free energy in more detail shortly, but the general principle can be sum-
marized as follows: chemical reactions proceed only in the direction that 
leads to a loss of free energy. In other words, the spontaneous direction 
for any reaction is the direction that goes “downhill.” A “downhill” reac-
tion in this sense is said to be energetically favorable.

enzymes reduce the energy needed to initiate 
spontaneous reactions 
Although  the  most  energetically  favorable  form  of  carbon  under  ordi-
nary conditions is CO2, and that of hydrogen is H2O, a living organism 
will not disappear in a puff of smoke, and the book in your hands will 
not  burst  spontaneously  into  flames.  This  is  because  the  molecules  in 
both the living organism and the book are in a relatively stable state, and 
they cannot be changed to lower-energy states without an initial input 
of energy. In other words, a molecule requires a boost over an energy 
barrier before it can undergo a chemical reaction that moves it to a lower-
energy  (more  stable)  state  (Figure  3–12a).  This  boost  is  known  as  the

Figure 3–12 Even energetically favorable 
reactions require activation energy to get 
them started. (a) compound Y (a reactant) 
is in a relatively stable state; thus energy 
is required to convert it to compound X 
(a product), even though X is at a lower 
overall energy level than Y. this conversion 
will not take place, therefore, unless 
compound Y can acquire enough activation 
energy (energy a minus energy b) from its 
surroundings to undergo the reaction that 
converts it into compound X. this energy 
may be provided by means of an unusually 
energetic collision with other molecules. For 
the reverse reaction, X → Y, the activation 
energy required will be much larger (energy 
a minus energy c); this reaction will therefore 
occur much more rarely. activation energies 
are always positive. the total energy change 
for the energetically favorable reaction  
Y → X, is energy c minus energy b, a 
negative number, which corresponds to 
a loss of free energy. (B) energy barriers 
for specific reactions can be lowered by 
catalysts, as indicated by the line marked d. 
enzymes are particularly effective catalysts 
because they greatly reduce the activation 
energy for the reactions they catalyze.

92 

CHapTER 3     energy, catalysis, and Biosynthesis

Figure 3–13 Lowering the activation 
energy greatly increases the probability 
that a reaction will occur. at any given 
instant, a population of identical substrate 
molecules will have a range of energies, 
distributed as shown on the graph. the 
varying energies come from collisions with 
surrounding molecules, which make the 
substrate molecules jiggle, vibrate, and 
spin. For a molecule to undergo a chemical 
reaction, the energy of the molecule must 
exceed the activation energy barrier for that 
reaction (dashed lines); for most biological 
reactions, this almost never happens 
without enzyme catalysis. even with enzyme 
catalysis, only a small fraction of substrate 
molecules reach an energy state that is high 
enough for them to undergo a reaction (red 
shaded area). 

Figure 3–14 Enzymes catalyze reactions 
by lowering the activation energy barrier. 
(a) the dam represents the activation 
energy, which is lowered by enzyme 
catalysis. each green ball represents 
a potential substrate molecule that is 
bouncing up and down in energy level 
owing to constant encounters with waves, 
an analogy for the thermal bombardment of 
substrate molecules by surrounding water 
molecules. When the barrier—the activation 
energy—is lowered significantly, the balls 
(substrate molecules) with sufficient energy 
can roll downhill, an energetically favorable 
movement. (B) the four walls of the box 
represent the activation energy barriers 
for four different chemical reactions that 
are all energetically favorable because the 
products are at lower energy levels than 
the substrates. In the left-hand box, none 
of these reactions occurs because even 
the largest waves are not large enough 
to surmount any of the energy barriers. 
In the right-hand box, enzyme catalysis 
lowers the activation energy for reaction 
number 1 only; now the jostling of the waves 
allows the substrate molecule to pass over 
this energy barrier, allowing reaction 1 to 
proceed (Movie 3.1). (c) a branching river 
with a set of barrier dams (yellow boxes) 
serves to illustrate how a series of enzyme-
catalyzed reactions determines the exact 
reaction pathway followed by each molecule 
inside the cell by controlling specifically 
which reaction will be allowed at each 
junction.

provided by the heat of a lighted match. But cells can’t raise their temper-
ature to drive biological reactions. Inside cells, the push over the energy 
barrier is aided by specialized proteins called enzymes.

ECB4 e3.13/3.13

Each enzyme binds tightly to one or two molecules, called substrates, 
and holds them in a way that greatly reduces the activation energy needed 
to facilitate a specific chemical interaction between them (Figure 3–12B). 
A substance that can lower the activation energy of a reaction is termed 
a catalyst; catalysts increase the rate of chemical reactions because they 
allow a much larger proportion of the random collisions with surround-
ing molecules to kick the substrates over the energy barrier, as illustrated 
in Figure 3–13 and Figure 3–14a. Enzymes are among the most effective 
catalysts  known.  They  can  speed  up  reactions  by  a  factor  of  as  much 
as 1014 (that is, trillions of times faster than the same reactions would 
proceed without an enzyme catalyst). Enzymes therefore allow reactions 
that  would  not  otherwise  occur  to  proceed  rapidly  at  the  normal  tem-
perature inside cells.

Unlike  the  effects  of  temperature,  enzymes  are  highly  selective.  Each 
enzyme  usually  speeds  up  only  one  particular  reaction  out  of  the  sev-
eral possible reactions that its substrate molecules could undergo. In this 
way, enzymes direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along 
specific reaction pathways (Figure 3–14B and C), thereby producing the 
compounds that the cell actually needs. 

ECB4 e3.15/3.15

Like all catalysts, enzyme molecules themselves remain unchanged after 
participating in a reaction and therefore can function over and over again 
(Figure 3–15). In Chapter 4, we will discuss further how enzymes work, 
after we have looked in detail at the molecular structure of proteins. 

The free-energy Change for a reaction determines 
Whether it Can occur
According  to  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics,  a  chemical  reaction 
can proceed only if it results in a net (overall) increase in the disorder of 
the universe (see Figure 3–5). Disorder increases when useful energy that 
could be harnessed to do work is dissipated as heat. The useful energy in 
a system is known as its free energy, or G. And because chemical reac-
tions involve a transition from one molecular state to another, the term 
that is of most interest to chemists and cell biologists is the free-energy 
change, denoted ΔG (“Delta G”). 
Let’s consider a collection of molecules. ΔG measures the amount of dis-
order created in the universe when a reaction involving these molecules 
takes place. Energetically favorable reactions, by definition, are those that 
create disorder by decreasing the free energy of the system to which they 
belong; in other words, they have a negative ΔG (Figure 3–16). 
A reaction can occur spontaneously only if ΔG is negative. On a macro-
scopic scale, an energetically favorable reaction with a negative ΔG is the 
relaxation of a compressed spring into an expanded state, releasing its 
stored elastic energy as heat to its surroundings. On a microscopic scale, 
an energetically favorable reaction with a negative ΔG occurs when salt 
(NaCl) dissolves in water. Note that, just because a reaction can occur 
spontaneously,  does  not  mean  it  will  occur  quickly.  The  decay  of  dia-
monds into graphite is a spontaneous process—but it takes millions of 
years. 

Energetically  unfavorable  reactions,  by  contrast,  create  order  in  the 
universe;  they  have  a  positive  ΔG.  Such  reactions—for  example,  the 
formation  of  a  peptide  bond  between  two  amino  acids—cannot  occur 
spontaneously; they take place only when they are coupled to a second 
reaction with a negative ΔG large enough that the net ΔG of the entire 
process is negative (Figure 3–17). Life is possible because enzymes can 
create  biological  order  by  coupling  energetically  unfavorable  reactions 
with  energetically  favorable  ones.  These  critical  concepts  are  summa-
rized, with examples, in panel 3–1 (pp. 96–97).

Figure 3–15 Enzymes convert substrates 
to products while remaining unchanged 
themselves. each enzyme has an active site 
to which one or two substrate molecules 
bind, forming an enzyme–substrate 
complex. a reaction occurs at the active 
site, generating an enzyme–product 
complex. the product is then released, 
allowing the enzyme to bind additional 
substrate molecules and repeat the 
reaction. an enzyme thus serves as a 
catalyst, and it usually forms or breaks 
a single covalent bond in a substrate 
molecule.

Consider the analogy of the jiggling 
box containing coins that was 
described on page 85. The reaction, 
the flipping of coins that either 
face heads up (h) or tails up (T), is 
described by the equation  
h ↔ T, where the rate of the 
forward reaction equals the rate of 
the reverse reaction.
a.   What are ΔG and ΔG° in this 
analogy? 
b.   What corresponds to the 
temperature at which the reaction 
proceeds? What corresponds to the 
activation energy of the reaction? 
assume you have an “enzyme,” 
called jigglase, which catalyzes this 
reaction. What would the effect of 
jigglase be and what, mechanically, 
might jigglase do in this analogy?

ΔG Changes as a reaction Proceeds Toward equilibrium
It’s  easy  to  see  how  a  tensed  spring,  when  left  to  itself,  will  relax  and 
release  its  stored  energy  to  the  environment  as  heat.  But  chemical 
reactions are a bit more complex—and harder to intuit. That’s because 
whether a reaction will proceed depends not only on the energy stored 
in each individual molecule, but also on the concentrations of the mol-
ecules  in  the  reaction  mixture.  Recalling  our  coin  analogy,  more  coins 
in a jiggling box will flip from a head to a tail orientation when the box 
contains 90 heads and 10 tails, than when the box contains 10 heads and 
90 tails. 

The same is true for a chemical reaction. As the energetically favorable 
reaction Y → X proceeds, the concentration of the product X will increase 
and the concentration of the substrate Y will decrease. This change in 
relative concentrations of substrate and product will cause the ratio of Y 
to X to shrink, making the initially favorable ΔG less and less negative. 
Unless more Y is added, the reaction will slow and eventually stop. 
Because ΔG changes as products accumulate and substrates are depleted, 
chemical  reactions  will  generally  proceed  until  they  reach  a  state  of  
equilibrium. At that point, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions 
are  equal,  and  there  is  no  further  net  change  in  the  concentrations  of 
substrate or product (Figure 3–18). For reactions at chemical equilibrium, 
ΔG = 0, so the reaction will not proceed forward or backward, and no 
work can be done. 

Such a state of chemical inactivity would be incompatible with life. Living 
cells  avoid  reaching  a  state  of  complete  chemical  equilibrium  because 
they are constantly exchanging materials with their environment: replen-
ishing nutrients and eliminating waste products. Many of the individual 
reactions in the cell’s complex metabolic network also exist in disequilib-
rium because the products of one reaction are continually being siphoned 
off to become the substrates in a subsequent reaction. Rarely do products 
and  substrates  reach  concentrations  at  which  the  forward  and  reverse 
reaction rates are equal. 

The standard free-energy Change, ΔG°, Makes it Possible 
to Compare the energetics of different reactions
Because ΔG depends on the concentrations of the molecules in the reac-
tion  mixture  at  any  given  time,  it  is  not  a  particularly  useful  value  for 
comparing the relative energies of different types of reactions. But such 
energetic assessments are necessary, for example, to predict whether an 
energetically favorable reaction is likely to have a ΔG negative enough 
to drive an energetically unfavorable reaction. To compare reactions in 
this way, we need to turn to the standard free-energy change of a reaction, 
ΔG°.  The  ΔG°  is  independent  of  concentration;  it  depends  only  on  the 
intrinsic  characters  of  the  reacting  molecules,  based  on  their  behavior 
under ideal conditions where the concentrations of all the reactants are 
set to the same fixed value of 1 mole/liter.
A large body of thermodynamic data has been collected from which ΔG° 
can be calculated for most metabolic reactions. Some common reactions 
are compared in terms of their ΔG° in Panel 3–1 (pp. 96–97).
The ΔG of a reaction can be calculated from ΔG° if the concentrations of 
the reactants and products are known. For the simple reaction Y → X, 
their relationship follows this equation: 

[X]
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln      
[Y]

where ΔG is in kilocalories per mole, [Y] and [X] denote the concentrations

FOR THE ENERGETICALLY FAVORABLE  REACTION Y → X,

when X and Y are at equal concentrations, [Y] = [X], the formation of X 
is energetically favored. In other words, the ΔG of Y → X is negative and 
the ΔG of X → Y is positive. But because of thermal bombardments, 
there will always be some X converting to Y.

EVENTUALLY
compensate for the slow rate of X → Y, such that the number of Y molecules 
being converted to X molecules each second is exactly equal to the number 
of X molecules being converted to Y molecules each second. At this point,
the reaction will be at equilibrium.

of Y and X in moles/liter, ln is the natural logarithm, and RT is the prod-
uct  of  the  gas  constant,  R,  and  the  absolute  temperature,  T.  At  37°C, 
RT = 0.616. (A mole is 6 × 1023 molecules of a substance.)
From  this  equation,  we  can  see  that  when  the  concentrations  of  reac-
tants and products are equal, in other words, [X]/[Y] = 1, the value of ΔG 
equals the value of ΔG° (because ln 1 = 0). Thus when the reactants and 
products are present in equal concentrations, the direction of the reac-
tion depends entirely on the intrinsic properties of the molecules. 

ECB4 e3.18/3.18

The equilibrium Constant is directly Proportional to ΔG°
As  mentioned  earlier,  all  chemical  reactions  tend  to  proceed  toward 
equilibrium. Knowing where that equilibrium lies for any given reaction 
will  tell  you  which  way  the  reaction  will  proceed—and  how  far  it  will 
go. For example, if a reaction is at equilibrium when the concentration 
of  the  product  is  ten  times  the  concentration  of  the  substrate,  and  we 
begin  with  a  surplus  of  substrate  and  little  or  no  product,  the  reaction 
will proceed forward for some time. For the simple reaction Y → X, that 
value—the ratio of substrate to product at equilibrium—is called the reac-
tion’s equilibrium constant, K. Expressed as an equation:

[X]
K =        
[Y]

where [X] is the concentration of the product and [Y] is the concentration 
of the substrate at equilibrium.

FREE ENERGY
This panel reviews the concept of free energy and offers
examples showing how changes in free energy determine
whether—and how—biological reactions occur.

The molecules of a living cell possess energy because of their 
vibrations, rotations, and movement through space, and 
because of the energy that is stored in the bonds between 
individual atoms.

The free energy, G  (in kcal/mole), measures the energy of a 
molecule which could in principle be used to do useful work at 
constant temperature, as in a living cell. Energy can also be 
expressed in joules (1 cal = 4.184 joules). 

REACTIONS CAUSE DISORDER
Think of a chemical reaction occurring in a cell that has a 
constant temperature and volume. This reaction can produce 
disorder in two ways.

1 Changes of bond energy of the reacting molecules can

cause heat to be released, which disorders the environment
around the cell.

ΔG (“DELTA G”)

Changes in free energy occurring in a reaction are 
denoted by ΔG, where “Δ” indicates a difference. Thus, 
for the reaction

A + B            C + D

ΔG = free energy (C + D) minus free energy (A + B)

ΔG measures the amount of disorder caused by a 
reaction: the change in order inside the cell, plus the 
change in order of the surroundings caused by the heat 
released.

ΔG is useful because it measures how far away from 
equilibrium a reaction is. Thus the reaction

ATP

ADP

+

Pi

has a large negative ΔG because cells keep the reaction 
a long way from equilibrium by continually making fresh 
ATP. However, if the cell dies, then most of its ATP will be 
hydrolyzed, until equilibrium is reached; at equilibrium, 
the forward and backward reactions occur at equal rates 
and ΔG = 0.

PREDICTING REACTIONS

From the second law of thermodynamics, we know 
that the disorder of the universe can only increase. ΔG 
is negative if the disorder of the universe (reaction plus 
surroundings) increases.

In other words, a chemical reaction that occurs 
spontaneously must have a negative ΔG:

Gproducts – Greactants = ΔG  <  0

EXAMPLE: The difference in free energy of 100 ml of 
10 mM sucrose (common sugar) and 100 ml of 10 mM 
glucose plus 10 mM fructose is about –5.5 calories. 
Therefore, the hydrolysis reaction that produces two 
monosaccharides from a disaccharide (sucrose → 
glucose + fructose) can proceed spontaneously.

To predict the outcome of a reaction (Will it proceed to the 
right or to the left? At what point will it stop?), we must 
measure its standard free-energy change (ΔG 
This quantity represents the gain or loss of free energy as one 
mole of reactant is converted to one mole of product under 
“standard conditions” (all molecules present at a 
concentration of 1 M and pH 7.0).

CHapTER 3     energy, catalysis, and Biosynthesis

But how do we know at what concentrations of substrate and product a 
reaction will reach equilibrium? It goes back to the intrinsic properties of 
the molecules involved, as expressed by ΔG°. Let’s see why. 
At  equilibrium,  the  rate  of  the  forward  reaction  is  exactly  balanced  by 
the rate of the reverse reaction. At that point, ΔG = 0, and there is no net 
change of free energy to drive the reaction in either direction (see Panel 
3–1, pp. 96–97).

Now, if we return to the equation presented on p. 94,

[X]
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln      
[Y]

we can see that, at equilibrium at 37°C, where ΔG = 0 and the constant 
RT = 0.616, this equation becomes:

[X]
ΔG° = –0.616 ln     
[Y]

In other words, ΔG° is directly proportional to the equilibrium constant, K:

ΔG° = –0.616 ln K

If we convert this equation from natural log (ln) to the more commonly 
used base–10 logarithm (log), we get
ΔG° = –1.42 log K

This equation reveals how the equilibrium ratio of Y to X, expressed as 
the  equilibrium  constant  K,  depends  on  the  intrinsic  character  of  the 
molecules, as expressed in the value of ΔG° (Table 3–1). It tells us that 
for every 1.42 kcal/mole difference in free energy at 37°C, the equilib-
rium  constant  changes  by  a  factor  of  10.  Thus,  the  more  energetically 
favorable the reaction, the more product will accumulate if the reaction 
proceeds to equilibrium.

in Complex reactions, the equilibrium Constant includes 
the Concentrations of all reactants and Products
We have so far discussed the simplest of reactions, Y → X, in which a 
single substrate is converted into a single product. But inside cells, it is 
more  common  for  two  reactants  to  combine  to  form  a  single  product:  
A + B 

 AB. How can we predict how this reaction will proceed?

The same principles apply, except that in this case the equilibrium con-
stant K includes the concentrations of both of the reactants, in addition 
to the concentration of the product:
K = [AB]/[A][B]

As  illustrated  in  Figure  3–19,  the  concentrations  of  both  reactants  are 
multiplied because the formation of product AB depends on the collision 
of A and B, and these encounters occur at a rate that is proportional to 
[A] × [B]. As with single-substrate reactions, ΔG° = –1.42 log K at 37°C.

The equilibrium Constant indicates the strength of 
Molecular interactions
The concept of free-energy change does not only apply to chemical reac-
tions  where  covalent  bonds  are  being  broken  and  formed,  but  also  to 
interactions where one molecule binds to another by means of noncov-
alent  interactions  (see  Chapter  2,  p.  63).  Noncovalent  interactions  are 
immensely important to cells. They include the binding of substrates to 
enzymes, the binding of gene regulatory proteins to DNA, and the bind-
ing of one protein to another to make the many different structural and 
functional protein complexes that operate in a living cell.

ΔG° represents the free-energy difference

From this table, we see that, if there is a 
favorable free-energy change of

there will be 1000 times more molecules

Figure 3–19 The equilibrium constant (K) 
for the reaction a + B → aB depends on 
both the association and dissociation rate 
constants. Molecules a and B must collide 
in order to interact, and the association 
rate is therefore proportional to the 
product of their individual concentrations 
[a] × [B]. as shown, the ratio of the rate 
constants kon and koff for the association 
and the dissociation reactions, respectively, 
is equal to the equilibrium constant, K, 
for the interaction. For two interacting 
components, K involves the concentrations 
of both substrates, in addition to that of the 
product. however, the relationship between 
K and ΔG° is the same as that shown in 
table 3–1. the larger the value of K, the 
stronger is the binding between a and B. 

Two molecules will bind to each other if the free-energy change for the 
interaction is negative; that is, the free energy of the resulting complex is 
lower than the sum of the free energies of the two partners when unbound. 
Because the equilibrium constant of a reaction is related directly to ΔG°, 
K is commonly employed as a measure of the binding strength of a non-
covalent interaction between two molecules. The binding strength is a 
very useful quantity to know because it also indicates how specific the 
interaction is between the two molecules. 

ECB4 e3.19/3.19

Consider the reaction that was shown in Figure 3–19, where molecule A 
interacts with molecule B to form the complex AB. The reaction proceeds 
until  it  reaches  equilibrium,  at  which  point  the  number  of  association 
events precisely equals the number of dissociation events; at this point, 
the concentrations of reactants A and B, and of the complex AB, can be 
used to determine the equilibrium constant K.

K becomes larger as the binding energy—that is, the energy released in 
the  binding  interaction—increases.  In  other  words,  the  larger  K  is,  the 
greater  is  the  drop  in  free  energy  between  the  dissociated  and  associ-
ated  states,  and  the  more  tightly  the  two  molecules  will  bind.  Even  a 
change of a few noncovalent bonds can have a striking effect on a bind-
ing interaction, as illustrated in Figure 3–20. In this example, eliminating 
a few hydrogen bonds from a binding interaction can be seen to cause a 
dramatic decrease in the amount of complex that exists at equilibrium.

for sequential reactions, the Changes in free energy are 
additive
Now we return to our original concern: how can enzymes catalyze reac-
tions that are energetically unfavorable? One way they do so is by directly 
coupling energetically unfavorable reactions with energetically favorable 
ones. Consider, for example, two sequential reactions,

X → Y and Y → Z

where the ΔG° values are +5 and –13 kcal/mole, respectively. (Recall that 
a mole is 6 × 1023 molecules of a substance.) The unfavorable reaction, 
X → Y, will not occur spontaneously. However, it can be driven by the 
favorable  reaction  Y  →  Z,  provided  that  the  second  reaction  follows 
the first. That’s because the overall free-energy change for the coupled 
reaction  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  free-energy  changes  for  each  indi-
vidual  reaction.  In  this  case,  the  ΔG°  for  the  coupled  reaction  will  be 
–8 kcal/mole, making the overall pathway energetically favorable.

Consider 1000 molecules of A and 1000 
molecules of B in the cytosol of a eukaryotic
cell. The concentration of both will be
about 10–9 M.
    If the equilibrium constant (K ) for 
A + B ↔ AB is 1010 liters/mole, then at 
equilibrium there will be

If the equilibrium constant is a little weaker,

the example above, or 2–3 fewer hydrogen
bonds—then there will be

CHapTER 3     energy, catalysis, and Biosynthesis

Cells  can  therefore  cause  the  energetically  unfavorable  transition,  
X → Y, to occur if an enzyme catalyzing the X → Y reaction is supplemented 
by a second enzyme that catalyzes the energetically favorable reaction,  
Y → Z. In effect, the reaction Y → Z acts as a “siphon,” pulling the conver-
sion of all of molecule X to molecule Y, and then to molecule Z (Figure 
3–21).  For  example,  several  of  the  reactions  in  the  long  pathway  that 
converts  sugars  into  CO2  and  H2O  are  energetically  unfavorable.  The 
pathway nevertheless proceeds rapidly to completion, however, because 
the total ΔG° for the series of sequential reactions has a large negative 
value.

Forming a sequential pathway, however, is not the answer for all meta-
bolic needs. Often the desired reaction is simply X → Y, without further 
conversion of Y to some other product. Fortunately, there are other, more 
general ways of using enzymes to couple reactions together, involving 
the  production  of  activated  carriers  that  can  shuttle  energy  from  one 
reaction site to another. We discuss these systems shortly. Before we do, 
let’s pause to look at how enzymes find and recognize their substrates 
and how enzyme-catalyzed reactions proceed. After all, thermodynamic 
considerations merely establish whether chemical reactions can occur; 
enzymes actually make them happen. 

Thermal Motion allows enzymes to find Their substrates 
Enzymes and their substrates are both present in relatively small amounts 
in  the  cytosol  of  a  cell,  yet  a  typical  enzyme  can  capture  and  process 
about a thousand substrate molecules every second. This means that an 
enzyme can release its product and bind a new substrate in a fraction of 
a millisecond. How do these molecules find each other so quickly in the 
crowded cytosol of the cell? 

Rapid  binding  is  possible  because  molecular  motions  are  enormously 
fast. Because of heat energy, molecules are in constant motion and con-
sequently will explore the cytosolic space very efficiently by wandering

In terms of energetics, the ΔG° of the

coupled to the X → Y reaction, it lowers 
the ΔG of X → Y, because the ΔG of X → Y 
decreases as the ratio of Y to X declines. as 
shown in Figure 3–18, arrow widths reflect 
the relative rates at which an individual

Figure 3–22 a molecule traverses the cytosol by taking a random 
walk. Molecules in solution move in a random fashion due to the 
continual buffeting they receive in collisions with other molecules. this 
movement allows small molecules to diffuse rapidly throughout the 
cell cytosol (Movie 3.2).

randomly through it—a process called diffusion. In this way, every mol-
ecule in the cytosol collides with a huge number of other molecules each 
second. As the molecules in a liquid collide and bounce off one another, 
an individual molecule moves first one way and then another, its path 
constituting a random walk (Figure 3–22). 

Although the cytosol of a cell is densely packed with molecules of vari-
ous  shapes  and  sizes  (Figure  3–23),  experiments  in  which  fluorescent 
dyes and other labeled molecules are injected into the cell cytosol show 
that small organic molecules diffuse through this aqueous gel nearly as 
rapidly as they do through water. A small organic molecule, such as a 
substrate, takes only about one-fifth of a second on average to diffuse a 
distance of 10 μm. Diffusion is therefore an efficient way for small mol-
ecules to move limited distances in the cell.

Because proteins diffuse through the cytosol much more slowly than do 
small  molecules,  the  rate  at  which  an  enzyme  will  encounter  its  sub-
strate depends on the concentration of the substrate. The most abundant 
substrates  are  present  in  the  cell  at  a  concentration  of  about  0.5  mM. 
Because pure water is 55 M, there is only about one such substrate mol-
ecule in the cell for every 105 water molecules. Nevertheless, the site on 
an enzyme that binds this substrate will be bombarded by about 500,000 
random collisions with the substrate every second. For a substrate con-
centration  tenfold  lower  (0.05  mM),  the  number  of  collisions  drops  to 
50,000 per second, and so on. 

The random encounters between an enzyme and its substrate often lead 
to  the  formation  of  an  enzyme–substrate  complex.  This  association  is 
stabilized by the formation of multiple, weak bonds between the enzyme 
and  substrate.  These  weak  interactions—which  can  include  hydrogen 
bonds, van der Waals attractions, and electrostatic attractions (discussed 
in Chapter 2)—persist until random thermal motion causes the molecules 
to dissociate again. When two colliding molecules have poorly match-
ing surfaces, few noncovalent bonds are formed, and their total energy 
is negligible compared with that of thermal motion. In this case, the two 
molecules dissociate as rapidly as they come together (see Figure 2–33). 
This is what prevents incorrect and unwanted associations from form-
ing between mismatched molecules, such as those between an enzyme 
and the wrong substrate. But when the enzyme and substrate are well 
matched,  they  form  many  weak  interactions,  which  keep  them  held 
together long enough for a covalent bond in the substrate molecule to 
be formed or broken. Knowing the speed at which molecules collide and 
come apart, as well as how fast bonds can be formed and broken, makes 
the observed rate of enzymatic catalysis seem a little less amazing.

Figure 3–23 The cytosol is crowded with various molecules. Only 
the macromolecules, which are drawn to scale, are shown. rNas are 
blue, ribosomes are green, and proteins are red. enzymes and other 
macromolecules diffuse relatively slowly in the cytosol, in part because 
they interact with so many other macromolecules. Small molecules, 
by contrast, can diffuse nearly as rapidly as they do in water. (adapted

CHapTER 3     energy, catalysis, and Biosynthesis

Vmax and KM Measure enzyme Performance 
To catalyze a reaction, an enzyme must first bind its substrate. The sub-
strate  then  undergoes  a  reaction  to  form  the  product,  which  initially 
remains bound to the enzyme. Finally, the product is released and dif-
fuses away, leaving the enzyme free to bind another substrate molecule 
and catalyze another reaction (see Figure 3–15). The rates of the different 
steps vary widely from one enzyme to another, and they can be meas-
ured by mixing purified enzymes and substrates together under carefully 
defined conditions in a test tube (see How We Know, pp. 104–106).

In such experiments, the substrate is introduced in increasing concentra-
tions to a solution containing a fixed concentration of enzyme. At first, 
the concentration of the enzyme–substrate complex—and therefore the 
rate at which product is formed—rises in a linear fashion in direct pro-
portion to substrate concentration. However, as more and more enzyme 
molecules  become  occupied  by  substrate,  this  rate  increase  tapers  off, 
until  at  a  very  high  concentration  of  substrate  it  reaches  a  maximum 
value, termed Vmax. At this point, the active sites of all enzyme molecules 
in the sample are fully occupied by substrate, and the rate of product for-
mation depends only on how rapidly the substrate molecule can undergo 
a reaction to form the product. For many enzymes, this turnover number 
is of the order of 1000 substrate molecules per second, although turnover 
numbers between 1 and 100,000 have been measured.

Because there is no clearly defined substrate concentration at which the 
enzyme can be deemed fully occupied, biochemists instead use a differ-
ent parameter to gauge the concentration of substrate needed to make 
the enzyme work efficiently. This value is called the Michaelis constant, 
KM,  named  after  one  of  the  biochemists  who  worked  out  the  relation-
ship. The KM of an enzyme is defined as the concentration of substrate 
at which the enzyme works at half its maximum speed (Figure 3–24). In 
general,  a  small  KM  indicates  that  a  substrate  binds  very  tightly  to  the 
enzyme, and a large KM indicates weak binding. 
Although an enzyme (or any catalyst) functions to lower the activation 
energy  for  a  reaction  such  as  Y  →  X,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the 
enzyme  will  also  lower  the  activation  energy  for  the  reverse  reaction  
X → Y to exactly the same degree. The forward and backward reactions 
will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the 
equilibrium point for the reaction—and thus its ΔG°—remains unchanged 
(Figure 3–25).

Figure 3–24 an enzyme’s performance depends on how rapidly it can process 
its substrate. the rate of an enzyme reaction (V ) increases as the substrate 
concentration increases, until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. at this point, all 
substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate 
of the reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. 
For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-
maximal (KM) is a direct measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large 
value of KM (a large amount of substrate needed) corresponding to weak binding.

aCTivaTed Carriers and biosynThesis
The energy released by energetically favorable reactions such as the oxi-
dation  of  food  molecules  must  be  stored  temporarily  before  it  can  be 
used by cells to fuel energetically unfavorable reactions, such as the syn-
thesis of all the other molecules needed by the cell. In most cases, the 
energy  is  stored  as  chemical-bond  energy  in  a  set  of  activated  carriers, 
small organic molecules that contain one or more energy-rich covalent 
bonds. These molecules diffuse rapidly and carry their bond energy from 
the sites of energy generation to the sites where energy is used for bio-
synthesis or for other energy-requiring cell activities (Figure 3–26).
Activated carriers store energy in an easily exchangeable form, either 
as a readily transferable chemical group or as readily transferable (“high 
energy”) electrons. They can serve a dual role as a source of both energy 
and chemical groups for biosynthetic reactions. The most important acti-
vated carriers are ATP and two molecules that are closely related to each 
other, NADH and NADPH. Cells use activated carriers like money to pay 
for the energetically unfavorable reactions that otherwise would not take 
place.

The formation of an activated Carrier is Coupled to an 
energetically favorable reaction 
When a fuel molecule such as glucose is oxidized in a cell, enzyme-cat-
alyzed reactions ensure that a large part of the free energy released is 
captured in a chemically useful form, rather than being released waste-
fully as heat. (Oxidizing sugar in a cell allows you to power metabolic 
reactions,  whereas  burning  a  chocolate  bar  in  the  street  will  get  you 
nowhere,  producing  no  metabolically  useful  energy.)  In  cells,  energy 
capture is achieved by means of a coupled reaction, in which an ener-
getically favorable reaction is used to drive an energetically unfavorable 
one  that  produces  an  activated  carrier  or  some  other  useful  molecule.

the equilibrium point for reactions. 
enzymes, like all catalysts, speed up the 
forward and reverse rates of a reaction by 
the same amount. therefore, for both the 
(a) uncatalyzed and (B) catalyzed reactions 
shown here, the number of molecules 
undergoing the transition X → Y is equal 
to the number of molecules undergoing 
the transition Y → X when the ratio of 
Y molecules to X molecules is 3.5 to 1, 
as illustrated. In other words, both the 
catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions will 
eventually reach the same equilibrium point, 
although the catalyzed reaction will reach 
equilibrium faster. 

Figure 3–26 activated carriers can store 
and transfer energy in a form that cells 
can use. By serving as intracellular energy 
shuttles, activated carriers perform their 
function as go-betweens that link the 
release of energy from the breakdown of 
food molecules (catabolism) to the energy-
requiring biosynthesis of small and large 
organic molecules (anabolism).

HOW WE KnOW
MEasuRing EnzyME pERFORManCE

At first glance, it seems that a cell’s metabolic pathways 
have been pretty well mapped out, with each reaction 
proceeding predictably to the next—substrate X is con-
verted to product Y, which is passed along to enzyme Z. 
So why would anyone need to know exactly how tightly 
a  particular  enzyme  clutches  its  substrate  or  whether 
it  can  process  100  or  1000  substrate  molecules  every 
second? 

In  reality,  such  elaborate  metabolic  maps  merely  sug-
gest which pathways a cell might follow as it converts 
nutrients into small molecules, chemical energy, and the 
larger building blocks of life. Like a road map, they do 
not  predict  the  density  of  traffic  under  a  particular  set 
of conditions: which pathways the cell will use when it 
is starving, when it is well fed, when oxygen is scarce, 
when  it  is  stressed,  or  when  it  decides  to  divide.  The 
study of an enzyme’s kinetics—how fast it operates, how 
it handles its substrate, how its activity is controlled—
makes it possible to predict how an individual catalyst 
will perform, and how it will interact with other enzymes 
in a network. Such knowledge leads to a deeper under-
standing of cell biology, and it opens the door to learning 
how to harness enzymes to perform desired reactions. 

speed
The first step to understanding how an enzyme performs 
involves determining the maximal velocity, Vmax, for the 
reaction  it  catalyzes.  This  is  accomplished  by  measur-
ing,  in  a  test  tube,  how  rapidly  the  reaction  proceeds 

in the presence of different concentrations of substrate 
(Figure 3–27a): the rate should increase as the amount 
of substrate rises until the reaction reaches its Vmax. The 
velocity of the reaction is measured by monitoring either 
how quickly the substrate is consumed or how rapidly 
the  product  accumulates.  In  many  cases,  the  appear-
ance of product or the disappearance of substrate can be 
observed directly with a spectrophotometer. This instru-
ment detects the presence of molecules that absorb light 
at a particular wavelength; NADH, for example, absorbs 
light  at  340  nm,  while  its  oxidized  counterpart,  NAD+, 
does not. So, a reaction that generates NADH (by reduc-
ing NAD+) can be monitored by following the formation 
of NADH at 340 nm in a spectrophotometer.
To determine the Vmax of a reaction, you would set up a 
series of test tubes, where each tube contains a different 
concentration of substrate. For each tube, add the same 
amount of enzyme and then measure the velocity of the 
reaction—the number of micromoles of substrate con-
sumed or product generated per minute. Because these 
numbers will tend to decrease over time, the rate used is 
the velocity measured early in the reaction. These initial 
velocity values (v) are then plotted against the substrate 
concentration,  yielding  a  curve  like  the  one  shown  in 
Figure 3–27B.

Looking  at  this  plot,  however,  it  is  difficult  to  deter-
mine  the  exact  value  of  Vmax,  as  it  is  not  clear  where 
the  reaction  rate  will  reach  its  plateau.  To  get  around 
this problem, the data are converted to their reciprocals

Figure 3–27 Measured reaction rates are plotted to determine Vmax and KM of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. (a) a series 
of increasing substrate concentrations is prepared, a fixed amount of enzyme is added, and initial reaction rates (velocities) are 
determined. (B) the initial velocities (v) plotted against the substrate concentrations [S] give a curve described by the general equation 
y = ax/(b + x). Substituting our kinetic terms, the equation becomes v = Vmax[S]/(KM + [S]), where Vmax is the asymptote of the curve (the 
value of y at an infinite value of x), and KM is equal to the substrate concentration where v is one-half Vmax. this is called the Michaelis–
Menten equation, named for the biochemists who provided evidence for this enzymatic relationship. (c) In a double-reciprocal plot, 1/v 
is plotted against 1/[S]. the equation describing this straight line is 1/v = (KM/Vmax)(1/[S]) + 1/Vmax. When 1/[S] = 0, the y intercept (1/v) 
is 1/Vmax. When 1/v = 0, the x intercept (1/[S]) is –1/KM. plotting the data this way allows Vmax and KM to be calculated more precisely. By 
convention, lowercase letters are used for variables (hence v for velocity) and uppercase letters are used for constants (hence Vmax).

and  graphed  in  a  “double-reciprocal  plot,”  where  the 
inverse of the velocity (1/v) appears on the y axis and 
the inverse of the substrate concentration (1/[S]) on the 
x axis (Figure 3–27C). This graph yields a straight line 
whose y intercept (the point where the line crosses the 
y axis) represents 1/Vmax and whose x intercept corre-
sponds  to  –1/KM.  These  values  are  then  converted  to 
values for Vmax and KM. 
Enzymologists  use  this  technique  to  determine  the 
kinetic parameters of many enzyme-catalyzed reactions 
(although these days computer programs automatically 
plot the data and spit out the sought-after values). Some 
reactions,  however,  happen  too  fast  to  be  monitored 
in  this  way;  the  reaction  is  essentially  complete—the 
substrate  entirely  consumed—within  thousandths  of  a 
second.  For  these  reactions,  a  special  piece  of  equip-
ment must be used to follow what happens during the 
first few milliseconds after enzyme and substrate meet 
(Figure 3–28). 

Control

Substrates  are  not  the  only  molecules  that  can  influ-
ence  how  well  or  how  quickly  an  enzyme  works.  In 
many  cases,  products,  substrate  lookalikes,  inhibitors, 
and other small molecules can also increase or decrease 
enzyme activity. Such regulation allows cells to control 
when and how rapidly various reactions occur, a proc-
ess we will consider in more detail in Chapter 4.

Determining  how  an  inhibitor  decreases  an  enzyme’s 
activity  can  reveal  how  a  metabolic  pathway  is  regu-
lated—and can suggest how those control points can be 
circumvented by carefully designed mutations in specific 
genes.

The effect of an inhibitor on an enzyme’s activity is mon-
itored in the same way that we measured the enzyme’s 
kinetics. A curve is first generated showing the velocity 
of  the  uninhibited  reaction  between  enzyme  and  sub-
strate,  as  described  previously.  Additional  curves  are 
then produced for reactions in which the inhibitor mol-
ecule has been included in the mix. 

Comparing these curves, with and without inhibitor, can 
also reveal how a particular inhibitor impedes enzyme 
activity. For example, some inhibitors bind to the same 
site  on  an  enzyme  as  its  substrate.  These  competitive 
inhibitors  block  enzyme  activity  by  competing  directly 
with  the  substrate  for  the  enzyme’s  attention.  They 
resemble  the  substrate  enough  to  tie  up  the  enzyme, 
but they differ enough in structure to avoid getting con-
verted  to  product.  This  blockage  can  be  overcome  by 
adding  enough  substrate  so  that  enzymes  are  more 
likely to encounter a substrate molecule than an inhib-
itor  molecule.  From  the  kinetic  data,  we  can  see  that 
competitive inhibitors do not change the Vmax of a reac-
tion;  in  other  words,  add  enough  substrate  and  the 
enzyme will encounter mostly substrate molecules and 
will reach its maximum velocity (Figure 3–29).

Figure 3–28 a stopped-flow apparatus is used to observe reactions during the first few milliseconds. In this piece of equipment, 
the enzyme and substrate are rapidly injected into a mixing chamber through two syringes. the enzyme and its substrate meet as they 
shoot through the mixing tube at flow rates that can easily reach 1000 cm/sec. they then enter another tube and zoom past a detector 
that monitors, say, the appearance of product. If the detector is located within a centimeter of where the enzyme and substrate meet, it 
is possible to observe reactions when they are only a few milliseconds old.

Figure 3–29 a competitive inhibitor directly blocks 
substrate binding to an enzyme. (a) the active site of 
the enzyme can bind either the competitive inhibitor or 
the substrate, but not both together. (B) the upper plot 
shows that inhibition by a competitive inhibitor can be 
overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. 
the double-reciprocal plot below shows that the Vmax 
of the reaction is not changed in the presence of the 
competitive inhibitor: the y intercept is identical for both 
the curves. 

Competitive inhibitors can be used to treat patients who 
have been poisoned by ethylene glycol, an ingredient in 
commercially  available  antifreeze.  Although  ethylene 
glycol is itself not fatally toxic, a by-product of its metab-
olism—oxalic acid—can be lethal. To prevent oxalic acid 
from  forming,  the  patient  is  given  a  large  (though  not 
quite  intoxicating)  dose  of  ethanol.  Ethanol  competes 
with the ethylene glycol for binding to alcohol dehydro-
genase, the first enzyme in the pathway to oxalic acid 
formation. As a result, the ethylene glycol goes mostly 
unmetabolized and is safely eliminated from the body.

ECB4 e3.28/3.28

Other types of inhibitors may interact with sites on the 
enzyme distant from where the substrate binds. As we 
discuss  in  Chapter  4,  many  biosynthetic  enzymes  are 
regulated  by  feedback  inhibition,  whereby  an  enzyme 
early in a pathway will be shut down by a product gener-
ated later in the pathway. Because this type of inhibitor 
binds to a separate regulatory site on the enzyme, the 
substrate can still bind, but it might do so more slowly 
than it would in the absence of inhibitor. Such noncom-
petitive  inhibition  is  not  overcome  by  the  addition  of 
more substrate.

design
With  the  kinetic  data  in  hand,  we  can  use  computer 
modeling programs to predict how an enzyme will per-
form, and even how a cell will respond when exposed 
to  different  conditions—such  as  the  addition  of  a  par-
ticular  sugar  or  amino  acid  to  the  culture  medium,  or 
the  addition  of  a  poison  or  a  pollutant.  Seeing  how  a 
cell  manages  its  resources—which  pathways  it  favors 
for dealing with particular biochemical challenges—can 
also suggest strategies for designing better catalysts for 
reactions  of  medical  or  commercial  importance  (e.g., 
for  producing  drugs  or  detoxifying  industrial  waste). 
Using such tactics, bacteria have even been genetically 

engineered  to  produce  large  amounts  of  indigo—the 
dye,  originally  extracted  from  plants,  that  makes  your 
blue jeans blue.

Computer  programs  have  been  developed  to  facilitate 
the  dissection  of  complex  reaction  pathways.  They 
require information about the components in the path-
way,  including  the  KM  and  Vmax  of  the  participating 
enzymes and the concentrations of enzymes, substrates, 
products,  inhibitors,  and  other  regulatory  molecules.  
The  program  then  predicts  how  molecules  will  flow 
through  the  pathway,  which  products  will  be  gener-
ated, and where any bottlenecks might be. The process 
is not unlike balancing an algebraic equation, in which 
every atom of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and so on must 
be  tallied.  Such  careful  accounting  makes  it  possible 
to  rationally  design  ways  to  manipulate  the  pathway, 
such  as  re-routing  it  around  a  bottleneck,  eliminating 
an important inhibitor, redirecting the reactions to favor 
the generation of predominantly one product, or extend-
ing the pathway to produce a novel molecule. Of course, 
such computer models must be validated in cells, which 
may not always behave as predicted.

Producing  designer  cells  that  spew  out  commercial 
products  generally  requires  using  genetic  engineering 
techniques to introduce the gene or genes of choice into 
a cell, usually a bacterium, that can be manipulated and 
maintained in the laboratory. We discuss these methods 
at greater length in Chapter 10. Harnessing the power of 
cell biology for commercial purposes—even to produce 
something as simple as the amino acid tryptophan—is 
currently  a  multibillion-dollar  industry.  And,  as  more 
genome data come in, presenting us with more enzymes 
to exploit, it may not be long before vats of custom-made 
bacteria are churning out drugs and chemicals that rep-
resent the biological equivalent of pure gold.

the potential energy stored in the

a variety of useful tasks

Figure 3–30 a mechanical model illustrates the principle of coupled chemical reactions. the spontaneous 
reaction shown in (a) could serve as an analogy for the direct oxidation of glucose to cO2 and h2O, which produces 
only heat. In (B), the same reaction is coupled to a second reaction, which could serve as an analogy for the synthesis 
of activated carriers. the energy produced in (B) is in a more useful form than in (a) and can be used to drive a 
variety of otherwise energetically unfavorable reactions (c).

Such  coupling  requires  enzymes,  which  are  fundamental  to  all  of  the 
energy transactions in the cell. 

The nature of a coupled reaction is illustrated by a mechanical analogy 
in  Figure  3–30,  in  which  an  energetically  favorable  chemical  reaction 
is represented by rocks falling from a cliff. The kinetic energy of falling 
rocks would normally be entirely wasted in the form of heat generated by 
friction when the rocks hit the ground (Figure 3–30A). By careful design, 
however, part of this energy could be used to drive a paddle wheel that 
lifts a bucket of water (Figure 3–30B). Because the rocks can now reach 
the ground only after moving the paddle wheel, we say that the energeti-
cally favorable reaction of rocks falling has been directly coupled to the 
energetically unfavorable reaction of lifting the bucket of water. Because 
part of the energy is used to do work in (B), the rocks hit the ground with 
less velocity than in (A), and correspondingly less energy is wasted as 
heat. The energy saved in the elevated bucket of water can then be used 
to do useful work (Figure 3–30C). 

ECB4 e3.30/3.30

Analogous processes occur in cells, where enzymes play the role of the 
paddle wheel in Figure 3–30B. By mechanisms that we discuss in Chapter 
13, enzymes couple an energetically favorable reaction, such as the oxi-
dation of foodstuffs, to an energetically unfavorable reaction, such as the 
generation of activated carriers. As a result, the amount of heat released 
by the oxidation reaction is reduced by exactly the amount of energy that 
is stored in the energy-rich covalent bonds of the activated carrier. That 
saved energy can then be used to power a chemical reaction elsewhere 
in the cell. 

aTP is the Most Widely Used activated Carrier 
The most important and versatile of the activated carriers in cells is ATP 
(adenosine 5ʹ-triphosphate). Just as the energy stored in the raised bucket 
of water in Figure 3–30B can be used to drive a wide variety of hydraulic 
machines, ATP serves as a convenient and versatile store, or currency, of 
energy that can be used to drive a variety of chemical reactions in cells.

CHapTER 3     energy, catalysis, and Biosynthesis

Figure 3–31 The interconversion of 
aTp and aDp occurs in a cycle. the two 
outermost phosphate groups in atp are 
held to the rest of the molecule by high-
energy phosphoanhydride bonds and 
are readily transferred to other organic 
molecules. Water can be added to atp to 
form aDp and inorganic phosphate (pi). 
Inside a cell, this hydrolysis of the terminal 
phosphate of atp yields between 11 and 
13 kcal/mole of usable energy. although 
the ΔGº of this reaction is –7.3 kcal/mole, 
the ΔG is much more negative, because the 
ratio of atp to the products aDp and pi is 
so high inside the cell.
   the large negative ΔGº of the reaction 
arises from a number of factors. release of 
the terminal phosphate group removes an 
unfavorable repulsion between adjacent 
negative charges; in addition, the inorganic 
phosphate ion (pi) released is stabilized by 
favorable hydrogen-bond formation with 
water. the formation of atp from aDp and 
pi reverses the hydrolysis reaction; because 
this condensation reaction is energetically 
unfavorable, it must be coupled to an 
energetically more favorable reaction to 
occur.

Figure 3–32 The terminal phosphate 
of aTp can be readily transferred to 
other molecules. Because an energy-
rich phosphoanhydride bond in atp 
is converted to a less energy-rich 
phosphoester bond in the phosphate-
accepting molecule, this reaction is 
energetically favorable, having a large 
negative ΔGº (see panel 3–1, pp. 96–97). 
phosphorylation reactions of this type are 
involved in the synthesis of phospholipids 
and in the initial steps of the breakdown of 
sugars, as well as in many other metabolic 
and intracellular signaling pathways.

As shown in Figure  3–31, ATP is synthesized in an energetically unfa-
vorable phosphorylation reaction, in which a phosphate group is added 
to  ADP  (adenosine  5ʹ-diphosphate).  When  required,  ATP  gives  up  this 
energy packet in an energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inor-
ganic phosphate (Pi). The regenerated ADP is then available to be used 
for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP, creat-
ing an ATP cycle in the cell.

ECB4 e3.31/3.31

The  energetically  favorable  reaction  of  ATP  hydrolysis  is  coupled  to 
many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules 
are  synthesized.  We  will  encounter  several  of  these  reactions  in  this 
chapter, where we will see exactly how this is done. ATP hydrolysis is 
often coupled to the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another 
molecule,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3–32.  Any  reaction  that  involves  the 
transfer of a phosphate group to a molecule is termed a phosphorylation 
reaction. Phosphorylation reactions are examples of condensation reac-
tions (see Figure 2–25), and they occur in many important cell processes: 
they activate substrates, mediate the exchange of chemical energy, and 
serve as key constituents of intracellular signaling pathways (discussed 
in Chapter 16).

QUesTion 3–8

The phosphoanhydride bond that 
links two phosphate groups in  
aTP in a high-energy linkage has a 
ΔG° of –7.3 kcal/mole. hydrolysis 
of this bond in a cell liberates from 
11 to 13 kcal/mole of usable energy. 
how can this be? Why do you think 
a range of energies is given, rather 
than a precise number as for ΔG°?

ATP is the most abundant activated carrier in cells. It is used, for example, 
to  supply  energy  for  many  of  the  pumps  that  actively  transport  sub-
stances into or out of the cell (discussed in Chapter 12); it also powers the 
molecular motors that enable muscle cells to contract and nerve cells to 
transport materials along their lengthy axons (discussed in Chapter 17). 
Why evolution selected this particular nucleotide over the others as the 
major carrier of energy, however, remains a mystery. The nucleotide GTP, 
although similar, has very different functions in the cell, as we discuss in 
later chapters. 

energy stored in aTP is often harnessed to Join Two 
Molecules Together
A common type of reaction that is needed for biosynthesis is one in which 
two molecules, A and B, are joined together by a covalent bond to pro-
duce A–B in the energetically unfavorable condensation reaction:

A–H + B–OH → A–B + H2O

ATP hydrolysis can be coupled indirectly to this reaction to make it go 
forward.  In  this  case,  energy  from  ATP  hydrolysis  is  first  used  to  con-
vert B–OH to a higher-energy intermediate compound, which then reacts 
directly  with  A–H  to  give  A–B.  The  simplest  mechanism  involves  the 
transfer of a phosphate from ATP to B–OH to make B–O–PO3, in which 
case the reaction pathway contains only two steps:

 
 
 

1. B–OH + ATP → B–O–PO3 + ADP
2. A–H + B–O–PO3 → A–B + Pi
Net result:  B–OH + ATP + A–H → A–B + ADP + Pi

The  condensation  reaction,  which  by  itself  is  energetically  unfavora-
ble, has been forced to occur by being coupled to ATP hydrolysis in an 
enzyme-catalyzed reaction pathway (Figure 3–33a).

A biosynthetic reaction of exactly this type is employed to synthesize the 
amino acid glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 3–33B. We will see later in 
the chapter that very similar (but more complex) mechanisms are also 
used to produce nearly all of the large molecules of the cell.

nadh and nadPh are both activated Carriers of 
electrons
Other  important  activated  carriers  participate  in  oxidation–reduction 
reactions  and  are  commonly  part  of  coupled  reactions  in  cells.  These 
activated carriers are specialized to carry both high-energy electrons and 
hydrogen atoms. The most important of these electron carriers are NADH 
(nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide)  and  the  closely  related  molecule 
NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Both NADH and 
NADPH carry energy in the form of two high-energy electrons plus a pro-
ton (H+), which together form a hydride ion (H–). When these activated 
carriers pass their energy (in the form of a hydride ion) to a donor mol-
ecule, they become oxidized to form NAD+ and NADP+, respectively.
Like  ATP,  NADPH  is  an  activated  carrier  that  participates  in  many 
important  biosynthetic  reactions  that  would  otherwise  be  energeti-
cally unfavorable. NADPH is produced according to the general scheme 
shown in Figure 3–34a. During a special set of energy-yielding catabolic 
reactions,  a  hydride  ion  is  removed  from  the  substrate  molecule  and 
added to the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ to form NADPH. This is a typi-
cal oxidation–reduction reaction; the substrate is oxidized and NADP+ is 
reduced.

(a) Schematic illustration of the formation of a–B in the condensation reaction described in the text. (B) the 
biosynthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is first converted to a high-energy 
phosphorylated intermediate (corresponding to the compound B–O–pO3 described in the text), which then reacts 
with ammonia (corresponding to a–h) to form glutamine. In this example, both steps occur on the surface of the 
same enzyme, glutamine synthetase (not shown). For clarity, the glutamic acid side chain is shown in its uncharged 
form. atp hydrolysis can drive this energetically unfavorable reaction because it yields more energy (ΔG° of 
–7.3 kcal/mole) than the energy required for the synthesis of glutamine from glutamic acid plus Nh3 (ΔG° 
of +3.4 kcal/mole).

ECB4 e3.33/3.33

The  hydride  ion  carried  by  NADPH  is  given  up  readily  in  a  subsequent 
oxidation–reduction reaction, because the ring can achieve a more stable 
arrangement of electrons without it. In this subsequent reaction, which 
regenerates  NADP+,  the  NADPH  becomes  oxidized  and  the  substrate 
becomes reduced—thus completing the NADPH cycle. NADPH is efficient 
at donating its hydride ion to other molecules for the same reason that 
ATP readily transfers a phosphate: in both cases, the transfer is accompa-
nied by a large negative free-energy change. One example of the use of 
NADPH in biosynthesis is shown in Figure 3–35.

nadPh and nadh have different roles in Cells
NADPH and NADH differ in a single phosphate group, which is located far 
from the region involved in electron transfer in NADPH (Figure 3–34B). 
Although  this  phosphate  group  has  no  effect  on  the  electron-transfer 
properties  of  NADPH  compared  with  NADH,  it  is  nonetheless  crucial 
for  their  distinctive  roles,  as  it  gives  NADPH  a  slightly  different  shape 
from NADH. This subtle difference in conformation makes it possible for 
the two carriers to bind as substrates to different sets of enzymes and 
thereby deliver electrons (in the form of hydride ions) to different target 
molecules.

Why should there be this division of labor? The answer lies in the need 
to regulate two sets of electron-transfer reactions independently. NADPH 
operates chiefly with enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions, supply-
ing the high-energy electrons needed to synthesize energy-rich biological 
molecules. NADH, by contrast, has a special role as an intermediate in

(a) NaDph is produced in 
reactions of the general type 
shown on the left, in which two 
hydrogen atoms are removed from 
a substrate. the oxidized form 
of the carrier molecule, NaDp+, 
receives one hydrogen atom plus 
an electron (a hydride ion), while 
the proton (h+) from the other 
h atom is released into solution. 
Because NaDph holds its hydride 
ion in a high-energy linkage, the 
ion can easily be transferred to 
other molecules, as shown on the 
right. (B) the structure of NaDp+ 
and NaDph. On the left is a ball-

of the NaDp+ molecule known as 
the nicotinamide ring accepts two

(the equivalent of a hydride ion, 
h–), forming NaDph. NaD+ and 
NaDh are identical in structure to 
NaDp+ and NaDph, respectively, 
except that they lack the 
phosphate group, as indicated.

the catabolic system of reactions that generate ATP through the oxida-
tion of food molecules, as we discuss in Chapter 13. The genesis of NADH 
from NAD+ and that of NADPH from NADP+ occurs by different pathways 
that are independently regulated, so that the cell can adjust the supply of 
electrons for these two contrasting purposes. Inside the cell, the ratio of 
NAD+ to NADH is kept high, whereas the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH is kept 
low.  This  arrangement  provides  plenty  of  NAD+  to  act  as  an  oxidizing 
agent and plenty of NADPH to act as a reducing agent—as required for 
their special roles in catabolism and anabolism, respectively.

Cells Make Use of Many other activated Carriers 
In addition to ATP (which transfers a phosphate) and NADPH and NADH 
(which transfer electrons and hydrogen), cells make use of other activated 
carriers that pick up and carry a chemical group in an easily transferred, 
high-energy linkage. FADH2, like NADH and NADPH, carries hydrogen and 
high-energy electrons (see Figure 13–13B). But other important reactions 
involve the transfers of acetyl, methyl, carboxyl, and glucose groups from 
activated carriers for the purpose of biosynthesis (Table 3–2). Coenzyme 
A, for example, can carry an acetyl group in a readily transferable link-
age.  This  activated  carrier,  called  acetyl  CoA  (acetyl  coenzyme  A),  is 
shown in Figure 3–36. It is used, for example, to add sequentially two-
carbon units in the biosynthesis of the hydrocarbon tails of fatty acids.

In acetyl CoA and the other activated carriers in Table 3–2, the transfer-
able group makes up only a small part of the molecule. The rest consists 
of a large organic portion that serves as a convenient “handle,” facilitat-
ing the recognition of the carrier molecule by specific enzymes. As with 
acetyl  CoA,  this  handle  portion  very  often  contains  a  nucleotide.  This 
curious  fact  may  be  a  relic  from  an  early  stage  of  cell  evolution.  It  is 
thought that the main catalysts for early life forms on Earth were RNA 
molecules  (or  their  close  relatives)  and  that  proteins  were  a  later  evo-
lutionary addition. It is therefore tempting to speculate that many of the 
activated carriers that we find today originated in an earlier RNA world, 
where their nucleotide portions would have been useful for binding these 
carriers to RNA-based catalysts, or ribozymes (discussed in Chapter 7).

Activated  carriers  are  usually  generated  in  reactions  coupled  to  ATP 
hydrolysis, as shown for biotin in Figure 3–37. Therefore, the energy that 
enables their groups to be used for biosynthesis ultimately comes from 
the catabolic reactions that generate ATP. Similar processes occur in the 
synthesis of the very large macromolecules—the nucleic acids, proteins, 
and polysaccharides—which we discuss next.

Figure 3–36 acetyl coenzyme a (Coa) is 
another important activated carrier. 
a ball-and-stick model is shown above the 
structure of acetyl coa. the sulfur atom 
(yellow) forms a thioester bond to acetate. 
Because the thioester bond is a high-
energy linkage, it releases a large amount 
of free energy when it is hydrolyzed; thus 
the acetyl group carried by coa can be 
readily transferred to other molecules.

CARBOXYL GROUP TRANSFER

Figure 3–37 an activated carrier transfers a carboxyl group to a substrate. Biotin is a vitamin that is used by 
a number of enzymes, including pyruvate carboxylase shown here. Once it is carboxylated, biotin can transfer a 
carboxyl group to another molecule. here, it transfers a carboxyl group to pyruvate, producing oxaloacetate, a 
molecule needed in the citric acid cycle (discussed in chapter 13). Other enzymes use biotin to transfer carboxyl 
groups to other acceptor molecules. Note that the synthesis of carboxylated biotin requires energy derived from atp 
hydrolysis—a general feature of many activated carriers.

The synthesis of biological Polymers requires an energy 
input
The  macromolecules  of  the  cell  constitute  the  vast  majority  of  its  dry 
mass—that  is,  the  mass  not  due  to  water.  These  molecules  are  made 
from subunits (or monomers) that are linked together by bonds formed 
during  an  enzyme-catalyzed  condensation  reaction.  The  reverse  reac-
tion—the  breakdown  of  polymers—occurs  through  enzyme-catalyzed 
hydrolysis reactions. These hydrolysis reactions are energetically favora-
ble, whereas the corresponding biosynthetic reactions require an energy 
input and are more complex (Figure 3–38).

The nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins, and polysaccharides are all 
polymers that are produced by the repeated addition of a subunit onto 
one  end  of  a  growing  chain.  The  mode  of  synthesis  of  each  of  these 
macromolecules is outlined in Figure 3–39. As indicated, the condensa-
tion step in each case depends on energy provided by the hydrolysis of a  
nucleoside triphosphate. And yet, except for the nucleic acids, there are 
no phosphate groups left in the final product molecules. How, then, is the 
energy of ATP hydrolysis coupled to polymer synthesis?

Figure 3–39 The synthesis of macromolecules requires an input of energy. 
Synthesis of a portion of (a) a polysaccharide, (B) a nucleic acid, and (c) a protein is 
shown here. In each case, synthesis involves a condensation reaction in which water 
is lost; the atoms involved are shaded in pink. Not shown is the consumption of 
high-energy nucleoside triphosphates that is required to activate each subunit prior 
to its addition. In contrast, the reverse reaction—the breakdown of all three types of 
polymers—occurs through the simple addition of water, or hydrolysis (not shown).

For each type of macromolecule, an enzyme-catalyzed pathway exists, 
which resembles that discussed previously for the synthesis of the amino 
acid  glutamine  (see  Figure  3–33).  The  principle  is  exactly  the  same,  in 
that the –OH group that will be removed in the condensation reaction is 
first  activated  by  forming  a  high-energy  linkage  to  a  second  molecule. 
The mechanisms used to link ATP hydrolysis to the synthesis of proteins 
and  polysaccharides,  however,  are  more  complex  than  that  used  for 
glutamine synthesis. In the biosynthetic pathways leading to these mac-
romolecules,  a  series  of  high-energy  intermediates  generates  the  final 
high-energy  bond  that  is  broken  during  the  condensation  step  (as  dis-
cussed in Chapter 7 for protein synthesis).

There are limits to what each activated carrier can do in driving biosyn-
thesis. For example, the ΔG for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic 
phosphate (Pi) depends on the concentrations of all of the reactants, and 
under the usual conditions in a cell, is between –11 and –13 kcal/mole. 
In principle, this hydrolysis reaction can be used to drive an unfavorable 
reaction with a ΔG of, perhaps, +10 kcal/mole, provided that a suitable 
reaction  path  is  available.  For  some  biosynthetic  reactions,  however, 
even –13 kcal/mole may be insufficient. In these cases, the path of ATP

hydrolysis can be altered so that it initially produces AMP and pyrophos-

about –26 kcal/mole. The biosynthetic reaction involved in the synthesis 
of nucleic acids (polynucleotides) is driven in this way (Figure 3–41).

that powers reactions in the cell. And in Chapters 13 and 14, we discuss

ter, we learn more about the proteins that make such reactions possible.

Figure 3–41 synthesis of a polynucleotide, 
Rna or Dna, is a multistep process 
driven by aTp hydrolysis. In the first step, 
a nucleoside monophosphate is activated 
by the sequential transfer of the terminal 
phosphate groups from two atp molecules. 
the high-energy intermediate formed—a 
nucleoside triphosphate—exists free in 
solution until it reacts with the growing 
end of an rNa or a DNa chain with release 
of pyrophosphate. hydrolysis of the 
pyrophosphate to inorganic phosphate 
is highly favorable and helps to drive 
the overall reaction in the direction of 
polynucleotide synthesis.

•	 Living	 organisms	 are	 able	 to	 exist	 because	 of	 a	 continual	 input	 of	
energy.  Part  of  this  energy  is  used  to  carry  out  essential  reactions 
that support cell metabolism, growth, movement, and reproduction; 
the remainder is lost in the form of heat.

•	 The	ultimate	source	of	energy	for	most	living	organisms	is	the	sun.	
Plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria use solar energy to pro-
duce organic molecules from carbon dioxide. Animals obtain food by 
eating plants or by eating animals that feed on plants.

•	 Each	of	the	many	hundreds	of	chemical	reactions	that	occur	in	a	cell	
is	 specifically	 catalyzed	 by	 an	 enzyme.	 Large	 numbers	 of	 different	
enzymes work in sequence to form chains of reactions, called meta-
bolic pathways, each performing a different function in the cell. 

•	 Catabolic	 reactions	 release	 energy	 by	 breaking	 down	 organic	 mol-
ecules,  including  foods,  through  oxidative  pathways.  Anabolic 
reactions generate the many complex organic molecules needed by 
the cell, and they require an energy input. In animal cells, both the 
building blocks and the energy required for the anabolic reactions are 
obtained through catabolic reactions.

•	 Enzymes	catalyze	reactions	by	binding	to	particular	substrate	mol-
ecules in a way that lowers the activation energy required for making 
and breaking specific covalent bonds.

•	 The	rate	at	which	an	enzyme	catalyzes	a	reaction	depends	on	how	
rapidly it finds its substrates and how quickly the product forms and 
then  diffuses  away.  These  rates  vary  widely  from  one  enzyme  to 
another.

•	 The	 only	 chemical	 reactions	 possible	 are	 those	 that	 increase	 the	
total amount of disorder in the universe. The free-energy change for 
a reaction, ΔG, measures this disorder, and it must be less than zero 
for a reaction to proceed spontaneously.

•	 The	ΔG for a chemical reaction depends on the concentrations of the 
reacting molecules, and it may be calculated from these concentra-
tions if the equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction (or the standard 
free-energy change, ΔG°, for the reactants) is known.

•	 Equilibrium	 constants	 govern	 all	 of	 the	 associations	 (and	 dissocia-
tions)  that  occur  between  macromolecules  and  small  molecules  in 
the cell. The larger the binding energy between two molecules, the 
larger the equilibrium constant and the more likely that these mol-
ecules will be found bound to each other.

•	 By	creating	a	reaction	pathway	that	couples	an	energetically	favora-
ble reaction to an energetically unfavorable one, enzymes can make 
otherwise impossible chemical transformations occur. 

•	 A	small	set	of	activated	carriers,	particularly	ATP,	NADH,	and	NADPH,	
plays a central part in these coupled reactions in cells. ATP carries 
high-energy  phosphate  groups,  whereas  NADH  and  NADPH  carry 
high-energy electrons.

•	 Food	 molecules	 provide	 the	 carbon	 skeletons	 for	 the	 formation	 of	
macromolecules. The covalent bonds of these larger molecules are 
produced  by  condensation  reactions  that  are  coupled  to  energeti-

described in the text are accurately represented by this 
equation? in particular, how can the equation be simplified 
when the substrate concentration [s] is in one of the 
following ranges: (a) [s] is much smaller than the KM, 
(b) [s] equals the KM, and (C) [s] is much larger than the KM?

QUesTion 3–21
The rate of a simple enzyme reaction is given by the 
standard Michaelis–Menten equation: 
rate = Vmax [s]/([s] + KM)
if the Vmax of an enzyme is 100 μmole/sec and the KM is 
1 mM, at what substrate concentration is the rate  
50 μmole/sec? Plot a graph of rate versus substrate (s) 
concentration for [s] = 0 to 10 mM. Convert this to a plot of 
1/rate versus 1/[s]. Why is the latter plot a straight line? 

QUesTion 3–22
select the correct options in the following and explain your 
choices. if [s] is much smaller than KM, the active site of the 
enzyme is mostly occupied/unoccupied. if [s] is very much 
greater than KM, the reaction rate is limited by the enzyme/
substrate concentration.

Plot the above data as a graph. Use this graph to estimate

b.  recall from the how We Know essay (pp. 104–106) that 
to determine these values more precisely, a trick is generally 
used in which the Michaelis–Menten equation is transformed 
so that it is possible to plot the data as a straight line.  
a simple rearrangement yields 

1/rate = (KM/Vmax) (1/[s]) + 1/Vmax

which is an equation of the form y = ax + b. Calculate 
1/rate and 1/[s] for the data given in part (a) and then plot 
1/rate versus 1/[s] as a new graph. determine KM and Vmax 
from the intercept of the line with the axis, where 1/[s] = 0, 
combined with the slope of the line. do your results agree 
with the estimates made from the first graph of the raw 
data? 
C.  it is stated in part (a) that only very little product 
was formed under the reaction conditions. Why is this 
important? 
d.  assume the enzyme is regulated such that upon 
phosphorylation its KM increases by a factor of 3 without

Protein Structure and Function

When we look at a cell in a microscope or analyze its electrical or bio-
chemical activity, we are, in essence, observing the handiwork of proteins. 
Proteins are the main building blocks from which cells are assembled, 
and  they  constitute  most  of  the  cell’s  dry  mass.  In  addition  to  provid-
ing the cell with shape and structure, proteins also execute nearly all its 
myriad functions. Enzymes promote intracellular chemical reactions by 
providing intricate molecular surfaces, contoured with particular bumps 
and  crevices  that  can  cradle  or  exclude  specific  molecules.  Proteins 
embedded in the plasma membrane form the channels and pumps that 
control the passage of nutrients and other small molecules into and out 
of the cell. Other proteins carry messages from one cell to another, or 
act  as  signal  integrators  that  relay  information  from  the  plasma  mem-
brane to the nucleus of individual cells. Some proteins act as motors that 
propel organelles through the cytoplasm, and others function as compo-
nents of tiny molecular machines with precisely calibrated moving parts. 
Specialized proteins also act as antibodies, toxins, hormones, antifreeze 
molecules,  elastic  fibers,  or  luminescence  generators.  Before  we  can 
hope to understand how genes work, how muscles contract, how nerves 
conduct electricity, how embryos develop, or how our bodies function, 
we must understand proteins. 
The multiplicity of functions carried out by proteins (Panel 4–1, p. 122) 
arises from the huge number of different shapes they adopt. We  therefore 
begin our description of these remarkable macromolecules by discussing 
their  three-dimensional  structures  and  the  properties  that  these  struc-
tures confer. We next look at how proteins work: how enzymes catalyze 
chemical reactions, how some proteins act as molecular switches, and 
how  others  generate  orderly  movement.  We  then  examine  how  cells 

122

ENZYMES
function:  Catalyze covalent bond breakage 
or formation.

STRUCTURAL PROTEINS
function:  Provide mechanical support to
cells and tissues.

TRANSPORT PROTEINS
function:  Carry small molecules or ions.

examples:  Living cells contain thousands of 
different enzymes, each of which catalyzes 
(speeds up) one particular reaction. Examples 
include: tryptophan synthetase—makes the 
amino acid tryptophan; pepsin—degrades 
dietary proteins in the stomach; ribulose 
bisphosphate carboxylase—helps convert 
carbon dioxide into sugars in plants; DNA 
polymerase—copies DNA; protein 
kinase—adds a phosphate group to a 
protein molecule.

examples:  Outside cells, collagen and elastin 
are common constituents of extracellular 
matrix and form ﬁbers in tendons and 
ligaments. Inside cells, tubulin forms long, stiff 
microtubules, and actin forms ﬁlaments that 
underlie and support the plasma membrane; 
keratin forms ﬁbers that reinforce epithelial 
cells and is the major protein in hair and horn.

examples:  In the bloodstream, serum albumin 
carries lipids, hemoglobin carries oxygen, and 
transferrin carries iron. Many proteins embedded 
in cell membranes transport ions or small 
molecules across the membrane. For example, the 
bacterial protein bacteriorhodopsin is a 
light-activated proton pump that transports H+
ions out of the cell; glucose carriers shuttle 
glucose into and out of cells; and a Ca2+ pump 
clears Ca2+ from a muscle cell’s cytosol after the 
ions have triggered a contraction.

MOTOR PROTEINS
function:  Generate movement in cells and
tissues.

STORAGE PROTEINS
function:  Store amino acids or ions.

SIGNAL PROTEINS
function:  Carry extracellular signals from 
cell to cell.

examples:  Myosin in skeletal muscle cells 
provides the motive force for humans to 
move; kinesin interacts with microtubules to 
move organelles around the cell; dynein 
enables eukaryotic cilia and ﬂagella to beat.

examples:  Iron is stored in the liver by 
binding to the small protein ferritin; 
ovalbumin in egg white is used as a source 
of amino acids for the developing bird 
embryo; casein in milk is a source of amino 
acids for baby mammals.

examples:  Many of the hormones and growth 
factors that coordinate physiological functions 
in animals are proteins; insulin, for example, is 
a small protein that controls glucose levels in 
the blood; netrin attracts growing nerve cell 
axons to speciﬁc locations in the developing 
spinal cord; nerve growth factor (NGF) 
stimulates some types of nerve cells to grow 
axons; epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
stimulates the growth and division of 
epithelial cells.

RECEPTOR PROTEINS
function:  Detect signals and transmit them 
to the cell's response machinery.

GENE REGULATORY PROTEINS
function:  Bind to DNA to switch genes on
or off.

SPECIAL-PURPOSE PROTEINS
function:  Highly variable.

examples:  Rhodopsin in the retina detects 
light; the acetylcholine receptor in the 
membrane of a muscle cell is activated by 
acetylcholine released from a nerve ending; 
the insulin receptor allows a cell to respond to 
the hormone insulin by taking up glucose; the 
adrenergic receptor on heart muscle increases 
the rate of the heartbeat when it binds to 
adrenaline.

examples:  The lactose repressor in bacteria 
silences the genes for the enzymes that 
degrade the sugar lactose; many different 
homeodomain proteins act as genetic 
switches to control development in 
multicellular organisms, including humans.

examples:  Organisms make many proteins with 
highly specialized properties. These molecules 
illustrate the amazing range of functions that 
proteins can perform. The antifreeze proteins of 
Arctic and Antarctic ﬁshes protect their blood 
against freezing; green ﬂuorescent protein from 
jellyﬁsh emits a green light; monellin, a protein 
found in an African plant, has an intensely sweet 
taste; mussels and other marine organisms secrete 
glue proteins that attach them ﬁrmly to rocks, 
even when immersed in seawater.

control the activity and location of the proteins they contain. Finally, we 
present a brief description of the techniques that biologists use to work 
with proteins, including methods for purifying them—from tissues or cul-
tured cells—and for determining their structures. 

The Shape and STrucTure of proTeinS
From  a  chemical  point  of  view,  proteins  are  by  far  the  most  structur-
ally  complex  and  functionally  sophisticated  molecules  known.  This  is 
perhaps  not  surprising,  considering  that  the  structure  and  activity  of 
each  protein  has  been  developed  and  fine-tuned  over  billions  of  years 
of  evolution.  We  start  by  considering  how  the  position  of  each  amino 
acid in the long string of amino acids that forms a protein determines its 
three-dimensional shape, which is stabilized by noncovalent interactions 
between different parts of the molecule. Understanding the structure of a 
protein at the atomic level allows us to see how the precise shape of the 
protein determines its function.

The Shape of a protein is Specified by its amino acid 
Sequence
Proteins, as you may recall from Chapter 2, are assembled mainly from 
a set of 20 different amino acids, each with different chemical proper-
ties. A protein molecule is made from a long chain of these amino acids, 
held together by covalent peptide bonds (Figure 4–1). Proteins are there-
fore referred to as polypeptides, and their amino acid chains are called 
polypeptide chains. In each type of protein, the amino acids are present 
in a unique order, called the amino acid sequence, which is exactly the 
same  from  one  molecule  of  that  protein  to  the  next.  One  molecule  of 
human insulin, for example, has the same amino acid sequence as every 
other molecule of human insulin. Many thousands of different proteins 
have been identified, each with its own distinct amino acid sequence.

Figure 4–2 A protein is made 
of amino acids linked together 
into a polypeptide chain. the 
amino acids are linked by peptide 
bonds (see Figure 4–1) to form 
a polypeptide backbone of 
repeating structure (gray boxes), 
from which the side chain of each 
amino acid projects. the character 
and sequence of the chemically 
distinct side chains—for example, 
nonpolar (green), polar uncharged 
(yellow), and negative (blue) side 
chains—give each protein its 
distinct, individual properties. 
a small polypeptide of just four 
amino acids is shown here. proteins 
are typically made up of chains of 
several hundred amino acids, whose 
sequence is always presented 
starting with the n-terminus reading 
from left to right.

Each  polypeptide  chain  consists  of  a  backbone  that  is  adorned  with  a 
variety of chemical side chains. This polypeptide  backbone is formed 
from a repeating sequence of the core atoms (–N–C–C–) found in every 
amino acid (see Figure 4–1). Because the two ends of each amino acid 
+, also written 
are chemically different—one sports an amino group (NH3
NH2) and the other a carboxyl group (COO–, also written COOH)—each 
polypeptide chain has a directionality: the end carrying the amino group 
is called the amino terminus, or N-terminus, and the end carrying the 
free carboxyl group is the carboxyl terminus, or C-terminus. 

ECB4 m3.01/4.02

Projecting  from  the  polypeptide  backbone  are  the  amino  acid  side 
chains—the part of the amino acid that is not involved in forming pep-
tide bonds (Figure 4–2). The side chains give each amino acid its unique 
properties: some are nonpolar and hydrophobic (“water-fearing”), some 
are  negatively  or  positively  charged,  some  can  be  chemically  reactive, 
and so on. The atomic formula for each of the 20 amino acids in proteins 
is presented in Panel 2–5 (pp. 74–75), and a brief list of the 20 common 
amino acids, with their abbreviations, is provided in Figure 4–3.

Figure 4–4 three types of noncovalent 
bonds help proteins fold. although a 
single one of any of these bonds is quite 
weak, many of them together can create a 
strong bonding arrangement that stabilizes 
a particular three-dimensional structure, 
as in the small polypeptide shown in 
the center. r is often used as a general 
designation for an amino acid side chain. 
protein folding is also aided by hydrophobic 
forces, as shown in Figure 4–5.

MBoC6 m3.04/4.04

Long polypeptide chains are very flexible, as many of the peptide bonds 
that link the carbon atoms in the polypeptide backbone allow free rota-
tion  of  the  atoms  they  join.  Thus,  proteins  can  in  principle  fold  in  an 
enormous  number  of  ways.  The  shape  of  each  of  these  folded  chains, 
however, is constrained by many sets of weak noncovalent bonds that 
form  within  proteins.  These  bonds  involve  atoms  in  the  polypeptide 
backbone, as well as atoms in the amino acid side chains. The noncova-
lent bonds that help proteins fold up and maintain their shape include 
hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals attractions, 
which are described in Chapter 2 (see Panel 2–7, pp. 78–79). Because a 
noncovalent bond is much weaker than a covalent bond, it takes many 
noncovalent  bonds  to  hold  two  regions  of  a  polypeptide  chain  tightly 
together. The stability of each folded shape is largely influenced by the 
combined strength of large numbers of noncovalent bonds (Figure 4–4).
A  fourth  weak  force,  hydrophobic  interaction,  also  has  a  central  role  in 
determining the shape of a protein. In an aqueous environment, hydro-
phobic molecules, including the nonpolar side chains of particular amino 
acids, tend to be forced together to minimize their disruptive effect on 
the hydrogen-bonded network of the surrounding water molecules (see 
Panel 2–2, pp. 68–69). Therefore, an important factor governing the fold-
ing  of  any  protein  is  the  distribution  of  its  polar  and  nonpolar  amino 
acids. The nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains—which belong to amino 
acids such as phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and tryptophan (see Figure 
4–3)—tend to cluster in the interior of the folded protein (just as hydro-
phobic oil droplets coalesce to form one large drop). Tucked away inside 
the folded protein, hydrophobic side chains can avoid contact with the 
aqueous cytosol that surrounds them inside a cell. In contrast, polar side 
chains—such as those belonging to arginine, glutamine, and histidine—
tend to arrange themselves near the outside of the folded protein, where 
they  can  form  hydrogen  bonds  with  water  and  with  other  polar  mole-
cules (Figure 4–5). When polar amino acids are buried within the protein, 
they are usually hydrogen-bonded to other polar amino acids or to the 
polypeptide backbone (Figure 4–6).

proteins fold into a conformation of Lowest energy
Each type of protein has a particular three-dimensional structure, which 
is determined by the order of the amino acids in its polypeptide chain. 
The final folded structure, or conformation, adopted by any polypeptide 
chain is determined by energetic considerations: a protein generally folds 
into the shape in which its free energy (G) is minimized. The folding proc-
ess is thus energetically favorable, as it releases heat and increases the 
disorder of the universe (see Panel 3–1, pp. 96–97). 

ECB4 e4.05/4.05

Protein folding has been studied in the laboratory using highly purified 
proteins. A protein can be unfolded, or denatured, by treatment with sol-
vents that disrupt the noncovalent interactions holding the folded chain 
together. This treatment converts the protein into a flexible polypeptide 
chain that has lost its natural shape. Under the right conditions, when the

Figure 4–7 Denatured proteins can 
often recover their natural shapes. this 
type of experiment demonstrates that the 
conformation of a protein is determined 
solely by its amino acid sequence. 
renaturation requires the correct conditions 
and works best for small proteins.

denaturing solvent is removed, the protein often refolds spontaneously 
into its original conformation—a process called renaturation (Figure 4–7). 
The  fact  that  a  denatured  protein  can,  on  its  own,  refold  into  the  cor-
rect conformation indicates that all the information necessary to specify 
the three-dimensional shape of a protein is contained in its amino acid 
sequence.

ECB4 e4.07/4.07

Each protein normally folds into a single stable conformation. This con-
formation,  however,  often  changes  slightly  when  the  protein  interacts 
with other molecules in the cell. This change in shape is crucial to the 
function of the protein, as we discuss later.

When proteins fold incorrectly, they sometimes form aggregates that can 
damage  cells  and  even  whole  tissues.  Misfolded  proteins  are  thought 
to  contribute  to  a  number  of  neurodegenerative  disorders,  such  as 
Alzheimer’s  disease  and  Huntington’s  disease.  Some  infectious  neuro-
degenerative  diseases—including  scrapie  in  sheep,  bovine  spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE, or “mad cow” disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt–
Jakob disease (CJD) in humans—are caused by misfolded proteins called 
prions. The misfolded prion form of a protein can convert the properly 
folded version of the protein in an infected brain into the abnormal confor-
mation. This allows the misfolded prions, which tend to form aggregates, 
to  spread  rapidly  from  cell  to  cell,  eventually  causing  the  death  of  the 
affected animal or human (Figure 4–8). Prions are considered “infectious” 
because  they  can  also  spread  from  an  affected  individual  to  a  normal 
individual  via  contaminated  food,  blood,  or  surgical  instruments,  for 
example.

Although a protein chain can fold into its correct conformation without 
outside help, protein folding in a living cell is generally assisted by spe-
cial proteins called chaperone proteins. Some of these chaperones bind 
to partly folded chains and help them to fold along the most energeti-
cally favorable pathway (Figure 4–9). Others form “isolation chambers” 
in which single polypeptide chains can fold without the risk of forming 
aggregates in the crowded conditions of the cytoplasm (Figure 4–10). In 
either case, the final three-dimensional shape of the protein is still speci-
fied  by  its  amino  acid  sequence;  chaperones  merely  make  the  folding 
process more efficient and reliable.

10,000,  the  vast  majority  are  between  50  and  2000  amino  acids  long. 
Proteins can be globular or fibrous, and they can form filaments, sheets, 
rings, or spheres (Figure 4–11). We will encounter many of these struc-
tures later in this chapter and throughout the book.

To  date,  the  structures  of  about  100,000  different  proteins  have  been 
determined. We discuss how scientists unravel these structures later in 
the  chapter.  Most  proteins  have  a  three-dimensional  conformation  so 
intricate and irregular that their structure would require an entire chap-
ter to describe in detail. But we can get some sense of the intricacies of 
polypeptide structure by looking at the conformation of a relatively small 
protein, such as the bacterial transport protein HPr. 

ECB4 n4.100/4.09

This small protein is only 88 amino acids long, and it serves as a car-
rier protein that facilitates the transport of sugar into bacterial cells. In 
Figure  4–12,  we  present  HPr’s  three-dimensional  structure  in  four  dif-
ferent ways, each of which emphasizes different features of the protein. 
The backbone model (Figure 4–12A) shows the overall organization of 
the polypeptide chain and provides a straightforward way to compare the 
structures of related proteins. The ribbon model (Figure 4–12B) shows the 
polypeptide backbone in a way that emphasizes its various folds, which 
we describe in detail shortly. The wire model (Figure 4–12C) includes the 
positions of all the amino acid side chains; this view is especially useful

polypeptide fold. In this case, the barrel of the chaperone provides an enclosed 
chamber in which a newly synthesized polypeptide chain can fold without the risk of 
aggregating with other polypeptides in the crowded conditions of the cytoplasm. 
this system also requires an input of energy from atp hydrolysis, mainly for the 
association and subsequent dissociation of the cap that closes off the chamber.

for predicting which amino acids might be involved in the protein’s activ-
ity. Finally, the space-filling model (Figure 4–12D) provides a contour map 
of the protein surface, which reveals which amino acids are exposed on 
the surface and shows how the protein might look to a small molecule 
such as water or to another macromolecule in the cell.

The  structures  of  larger  proteins—or  of  multiprotein  complexes—are 
even more complex. To visualize such detailed and complicated struc-
tures, scientists have developed various graphical and computer-based 
tools that generate a variety of images of a protein, only some of which 
are depicted in Figure 4–12. These images can be displayed on a com-
puter screen and readily rotated and magnified to view all aspects of the 
structure (Movie 4.1). 

When  the  three-dimensional  structures  of  many  different  protein 
molecules are compared, it becomes clear that, although the overall con-
formation of each protein is unique, some regular folding patterns can be 
detected, as we discuss next. 

The α helix and the β Sheet are common folding patterns
More than 60 years ago, scientists studying hair and silk discovered two 
common folding patterns present in many different proteins. The first to 
be discovered, called the α helix, was found in the protein α-keratin, which 
is abundant in skin and its derivatives—such as hair, nails, and horns. 
Within a year of the discovery of the α helix, a second folded structure, 
called a β sheet, was found in the protein fibroin, the major constituent 
of silk. (Biologists often use Greek letters to name their discoveries, with 
the first example receiving the designation α, the second β, and so on.) 
These two folding patterns are particularly common because they result 
from  hydrogen  bonds  that  form  between  the  N–H  and  C=O  groups  in 
the polypeptide backbone (see Figure 4–6). Because the amino acid side 
chains are not involved in forming these hydrogen bonds, α helices and β 
sheets can be generated by many different amino acid sequences. In each 
case, the protein chain adopts a regular, repeating form. These structural 
features, and the shorthand cartoon symbols that are often used to repre-
sent them in models of protein structures, are presented in Figure 4–13.

helices form readily in Biological Structures 
The abundance of helices in proteins is, in a way, not surprising. A helix 
is  a  regular  structure  that  resembles  a  spiral  staircase.  It  is  generated 
simply  by  placing  many  similar  subunits  next  to  one  another,  each  in 
the  same  strictly  repeated  relationship  to  the  one  before.  Because  it  is 
very rare for subunits to join up in a straight line, this arrangement will 
generally result in a helix (Figure 4–14). Depending on the twist of the 
staircase, a helix is said to be either right-handed or left-handed (Figure 
4–14E). Handedness is not affected by turning the helix upside down, but 
it is reversed if the helix is reflected in a mirror.
An α  helix  is  generated  when  a  single  polypeptide  chain  turns  around 
itself  to  form  a  structurally  rigid  cylinder.  A  hydrogen  bond  is  made 
between every fourth amino acid, linking the C=O of one peptide bond to

the N–H of another (see Figure 4–13A). This gives rise to a regular right-
handed helix with a complete turn every 3.6 amino acids (Movie 4.2). 
Short  regions  of  α  helix  are  especially  abundant  in  proteins  that  are 
embedded in cell membranes, such as transport proteins and receptors. 
We will see in Chapter 11 that those portions of a transmembrane pro-
tein that cross the lipid bilayer usually form an α helix that is composed 
largely of amino acids with nonpolar side chains. The polypeptide back-
bone,  which  is  hydrophilic,  is  hydrogen-bonded  to  itself  in  the α  helix, 
and it is shielded from the hydrophobic lipid environment of the mem-
brane by its protruding nonpolar side chains (Figure 4–15).
Sometimes  two  (or  three)  α  helices  will  wrap  around  one  another  to 
form a particularly stable structure known as a coiled-coil. This struc-
ture forms when the α helices have most of their nonpolar (hydrophobic) 
side chains on one side, so that they can twist around each other with 

remembering that the amino 
acid side chains projecting from 
each polypeptide backbone in a 
β sheet point alternately above 
and below the plane of the sheet 
(see figure 4–13d), consider 
the following protein sequence: 
Leu-Lys-Val-asp-ile-Ser-Leu-arg-
Leu-Lys-ile-arg-phe-Glu. do you 
find anything remarkable about the 
arrangement of the amino acids in 
this sequence when incorporated 
into a β sheet? can you make any 
predictions as to how the β sheet 
might be arranged in a protein? 
(hint: consult the properties of the 
amino acids listed in figure 4–3.)

Figure 4–14 the helix is a common, 
regular, biological structure. a helix will 
form when a series of similar subunits 
bind to each other in a regular way. at 
the bottom, the interaction between two 
subunits is shown; behind them are the 
helices that result. these helices have two 
(a), three (B), or six (c and D) subunits per 
helical turn. at the top, the arrangement 
of subunits has been photographed from 
directly above the helix. note that the 
helix in (D) has a wider path than that in 
(c), but the same number of subunits per 
turn. (e) a helix can be either right-handed 
or left-handed. as a reference, it is useful 
to remember that standard metal screws, 
which advance when turned clockwise, are 
right-handed. So to judge the handedness 
of a helix, imagine screwing it into a wall. 
note that a helix preserves the same 
handedness when it is turned upside down.

20 amino acids are required to span a 
membrane in this way. note that, despite 
the appearance of a space along the interior 
of the helix in this schematic diagram, the 
helix is not a channel: no ions or small 
molecules can pass through it.

framework  for  many  elongated  proteins.  Examples  include  α-keratin, 
which forms the intracellular fibers that reinforce the outer layer of the 
skin, and myosin, the motor protein responsible for muscle contraction 
(discussed in Chapter 17).

ECB4 m3.26/4.14

β Sheets form rigid Structures at the core of Many 
proteins
A β sheet is made when hydrogen bonds form between segments of a 
polypeptide chain that lie side by side (see Figure 4–13D). When the neigh-
boring segments run in the same orientation (say, from the N-terminus to 
the C-terminus), the structure is a parallel β sheet; when they run in oppo-
site directions, the structure is an antiparallel β sheet (Figure 4–17). Both 
types of β sheet produce a very rigid, pleated structure, and they form the 
core of many proteins. Even the small bacterial protein HPr (see Figure 
4–12) contains several β sheets.
β sheets have remarkable properties. They give silk fibers their extraor-
dinary  tensile  strength.  They  also  permit  the  formation  of  amyloid 
fibers—insoluble  protein  aggregates  that  include  those  associated  with 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and prion dis-
eases (see Figure 4–8). These structures, formed from abnormally folded 
proteins, are stabilized by β sheets that stack together tightly, with their 
amino  acid  side  chains  interdigitated  like  the  teeth  of  a  zipper  (Figure 
4–18). Although we tend to associate amyloid fibers with disease, many 
organisms  take  advantage  of  these  stable  structures  to  perform  novel 
tasks.  Infectious  bacteria,  for  example,  can  use  amyloid  fibers  to  help 
form the biofilms that allow them to colonize host tissues. Other types of 
filamentous bacteria use amyloid fibers to extend filaments into the air, 
enabling the bacteria to disperse their spores far and wide.

proteins have Several Levels of organization
A protein’s structure does not end with α helices and β sheets; there are 
additional levels of organization. These levels are not independent but 
are built one upon the next to establish the three-dimensional structure 
of  the  entire  protein.  A  protein’s  structure  begins  with  its  amino  acid 
sequence,  which  is  thus  considered  its  primary  structure.  The  next 
level of organization includes the α helices and β sheets that form within

Figure 4–16 Intertwined α helices can 
form a stiff coiled-coil. In (a), a single α 
helix is shown, with successive amino acid 
side chains labeled in a sevenfold repeating 
sequence “abcdefg.” amino acids “a” and 
“d” in such a sequence lie close together 
on the cylinder surface, forming a stripe 
(shaded in green) that winds slowly around 
the α helix. proteins that form coiled-coils 
typically have nonpolar amino acids at 
positions “a” and “d.” consequently, as 
shown in (B), the two α helices can wrap 
around each other, with the nonpolar side 
chains of one α helix interacting with the 
nonpolar side chains of the other, while the 
more hydrophilic amino acid side chains 
(shaded in red ) are left exposed to the 
aqueous environment. (c) a portion of 
the atomic structure of a coiled-coil made 
of two α helices, as determined by X-ray

form the backbone of the helices are shown 
in red; the interacting, nonpolar side chains 
are green, and the remaining side chains 
are gray. coiled-coils can also form from 
three α helices (Movie 4.3).

certain  segments  of  the  polypeptide  chain;  these  folds  are  elements  of 
the protein’s secondary  structure. The full, three-dimensional confor-
mation formed by an entire polypeptide chain—including the α helices, 
β  sheets,  random  coils,  and  any  other  loops  and  folds  that  form 
between the N- and C-termini—is sometimes referred to as the tertiary 
structure. Finally, if the protein molecule is formed as a complex of more 
than one polypeptide chain, then the complete structure is designated its  
quaternary structure.

ECB4 m3.09/4.16

Studies  of  the  conformation,  function,  and  evolution  of  proteins  have 
also  revealed  the  importance  of  a  level  of  organization  distinct  from 
the four just described. This organizational unit is the protein domain, 
which  is  defined  as  any  segment  of  a  polypeptide  chain  that  can  fold 
independently into a compact, stable structure. A protein domain usually 
contains between 40 and 350 amino acids—folded into α helices and β 
sheets and other elements of secondary structure—and it is the modu-
lar unit from which many larger proteins are constructed (Figure 4–19). 
The  different  domains  of  a  protein  are  often  associated  with  different 
functions.  For  example,  the  bacterial  catabolite  activator  protein  (CAP), 
illustrated in Figure 4–19, has two domains: the small domain binds to 
DNA, while the large domain binds cyclic AMP, a small intracellular sig-
naling molecule. When the large domain binds cyclic AMP, it causes a 
conformational change in the protein that enables the small domain to 
bind to a specific DNA sequence and thereby promote the expression of 
an adjacent gene. To provide a sense of the many different domain struc-
tures observed in proteins, ribbon models of three different domains are 
shown in Figure 4–20.

Figure 4–17 β sheets come in two varieties. (a) antiparallel β sheet 
(see also Figure 4–13D). (B) parallel β sheet. Both of these structures 
are common in proteins. By convention, the arrows point toward the 
c-terminus of the polypeptide chain (Movie 4.4).

Many proteins also contain unstructured regions
Small  protein  molecules,  such  as  the  oxygen-carrying  muscle  protein 
myoglobin, contain only a single domain (see Figure 4–11). Larger pro-
teins can contain as many as several dozen domains, which are usually 
connected by relatively unstructured lengths of polypeptide chain. Such 
regions of polypeptide chain lacking any definite structure, which contin-
ually bend and flex due to thermal buffeting, are abundant in cells. These 
intrinsically  disordered  sequences are often found as short stretches 
linking  domains  in  otherwise  highly  ordered  proteins.  Other  proteins, 
however,  are  almost  entirely  without  secondary  structure  and  exist  as 
unfolded polypeptide chains in the cytosol.

Intrinsically disordered sequences remained undetected for many years. 
Their  lack  of  folded  structure  makes  them  prime  targets  for  the  prote-
olytic  enzymes  that  are  released  when  cells  are  fractionated  to  isolate 
their molecular components (see Panel 4–3, pp. 164–165). Unstructured 
sequences also fail to form protein crystals and for this reason escape 
the  attention  of  X-ray  crystallographers  (see  How  We  Know,  pp.  162–
163). Indeed, the ubiquity of disordered sequences became appreciated 
only  after  bioinformatics  methods  were  developed  that  could  recog-
nize them from their amino acid sequences. Present estimates suggest 
that a third of all eukaryotic proteins have long unstructured regions in 
their polypeptide chain (greater than 30 amino acids in length), while a 
substantial number of eukaryotic proteins are mostly disordered under 
normal conditions.

Unstructured  sequences  have  a  variety  of  important  functions  in  cells. 
Being able to flex and bend, they can wrap around one or more target 
proteins like a scarf, binding with both high specificity and low affinity 
(Figure 4–21). By forming flexible tethers between the compact domains 
in  a  protein,  they  provide  flexibility  while  increasing  the  frequency  of 
encounters  between  the  domains  (Figure  4–21).  They  can  help  scaffold 
proteins  bring  together  proteins  in  an  intracellular  signaling  pathway, 
facilitating interactions (Figure 4–21). They also give proteins like elastin

chemical groups that control the way many proteins behave—a topic we 
discuss at length later in the chapter.

few of the Many possible polypeptide chains  
Will Be useful
In theory, a vast number of different polypeptide chains could be made 
from  20  different  amino  acids.  Because  each  amino  acid  is  chemically 
distinct and could, in principle, occur at any position, a polypeptide chain 
four  amino  acids  long  has  20  ×  20  ×  20  ×  20  =  160,000  different  pos-
sible sequences. In other words, for a polypeptide that is n amino acids 
long, 20n different chains are possible. For a typical protein length of 300 
amino acids, more than 20300 (that’s 10390) different polypeptide chains 
could theoretically be made.

Of the unimaginably large collection of potential polypeptide sequences, 
only a miniscule fraction is actually present in cells. That’s because many 
biological functions depend on proteins with stable, well-defined three-
dimensional conformations. This requirement restricts the list of possible 
polypeptide  sequences.  Another  constraint  is  that  functional  proteins

random mutations only very rarely 
result in changes in a protein that 
improve its usefulness for the cell, 
yet useful mutations are selected in 
evolution. Because these changes 
are so rare, for each useful mutation 
there are innumerable mutations 
that lead to either no improvement 
or inactive proteins. Why, then, do 
cells not contain millions of proteins 
that are of no use?

must be “well-behaved” and not engage in unwanted associations with 
other  proteins  in  the  cell—forming  insoluble  protein  aggregates,  for 
example. Many potential proteins would therefore have been eliminated 
by natural selection through the long trial-and-error process that under-
lies evolution (discussed in Chapter 9).

Thanks to this rigorous process of selection, the amino acid sequences of 
many present-day proteins have evolved to guarantee that the polypep-
tide will adopt a stable conformation—one that bestows upon the protein 
the  exact  chemical  properties  that  will  enable  it  to  perform  a  particu-
lar function. Such proteins are so precisely built that a change in even 
a few atoms in one amino acid can sometimes disrupt the structure of 
a  protein  and  thereby  eliminate  its  function.  In  fact,  the  structures  of 
many proteins—and their constituent domains—are so stable and effec-
tive that they have been conserved throughout evolution among many 
diverse organisms. The three-dimensional structures of the DNA-binding 
domains from the yeast α2 protein and the Drosophila Engrailed protein, 
for example, are almost completely superimposable, even though these 
organisms are separated by more than a billion years of evolution. Other 
proteins, however, have changed their structure and function over evolu-
tionary time, as we now discuss.

proteins can Be classified into families
Once  a  protein  had  evolved  a  stable  conformation  with  useful  proper-
ties,  its  structure  could  be  modified  over  time  to  enable  it  to  perform 
new functions. We know that this occurred quite often during evolution, 
because many present-day proteins can be grouped into protein fami-
lies, in which each family member has an amino acid sequence and a 
three-dimensional conformation that closely resemble those of the other 
family members.

Consider, for example, the serine proteases, a family of protein-cleaving 
(proteolytic) enzymes that includes the digestive enzymes chymotrypsin, 
trypsin, and elastase, as well as several proteases involved in blood clot-
ting.  When  any  two  of  these  enzymes  are  compared,  portions  of  their 
amino  acid  sequences  are  found  to  be  nearly  the  same.  The  similarity 
of their three-dimensional conformations is even more striking: most of 
the detailed twists and turns in their polypeptide chains, which are sev-
eral hundred amino acids long, are virtually identical (Figure 4–22). The 
various serine proteases nevertheless have distinct enzymatic activities, 
each cleaving different proteins or the peptide bonds between different 
types of amino acids.

Figure 4–22 Serine proteases constitute a 
family of proteolytic enzymes. Backbone 
models of two serine proteases, elastase 
and chymotrypsin, are illustrated. although 
only those amino acid sequences in the 
polypeptide chain shaded in green are 
the same in the two proteins, the two 
conformations are very similar nearly 
everywhere. nonetheless, the two proteases 
prefer different substrates. the active site 
of each enzyme—where its substrates are 
bound and cleaved—is circled in red. 
   Serine proteases derive their name 
from the amino acid serine, which directly 
participates in the cleavage reaction. the 
two black dots on the right side of the 
chymotrypsin molecule mark the two ends 
created where the enzyme has cleaved its 
own backbone.

Large protein Molecules often contain More Than  
one polypeptide chain
The  same  type  of  weak  noncovalent  bonds  that  enable  a  polypeptide 
chain  to  fold  into  a  specific  conformation  also  allow  proteins  to  bind 
to  each  other  to  produce  larger  structures  in  the  cell.  Any  region  on  a 
protein’s  surface  that  interacts  with  another  molecule  through  sets  of 
noncovalent bonds is termed a binding site. A protein can contain binding 
sites for a variety of molecules, large and small. If a binding site recog-
nizes  the  surface  of  a  second  protein,  the  tight  binding  of  two  folded 
polypeptide chains at this site will create a larger protein, whose quater-
nary structure has a precisely defined geometry. Each polypeptide chain 
in such a protein is called a subunit, and each subunit may contain more 
than one domain.

In the simplest case, two identical, folded polypeptide chains form a sym-
metrical  complex  of  two  protein  subunits  (called  a  dimer )  that  is  held 
together  by  interactions  between  two  identical  binding  sites.  The  CAP 
protein in bacterial cells is a dimer (Figure 4–23A) formed from two iden-
tical copies of the protein subunit shown previously in Figure 4–19. Many 
other  symmetrical  protein  complexes,  formed  from  multiple  copies  of 
the same polypeptide chain, are commonly found in cells. The enzyme 
neuraminidase,  for  example,  consists  of  a  ring  of  four  identical  protein 
subunits (Figure 4–23B).

ChAPteR 4     protein Structure and Function

Figure 4–24 Some proteins are formed as 
a symmetrical assembly of two different 
subunits. hemoglobin, an oxygen-carrying 
protein abundant in red blood cells, 
contains two copies of α-globin (green) and 
two copies of β-globin (blue). each of these 
four polypeptide chains contains a heme 
molecule (red ), where oxygen (O2) is bound. 
thus, each molecule of hemoglobin in the 
blood carries four molecules of oxygen.

Other  proteins  contain  two  or  more  different  polypeptide  chains. 
Hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells, is a partic-
ularly well-studied example. The protein contains two identical α-globin 
subunits  and  two  identical  β-globin  subunits,  symmetrically  arranged 
(Figure 4–24). Many proteins contain multiple subunits, and they can be 
very large (Movie 4.5).

proteins can assemble into filaments, Sheets, or Spheres
Proteins  can  form  even  larger  assemblies  than  those  discussed  so  far. 
Most  simply,  a  chain  of  identical  protein  molecules  can  be  formed  if 
the binding site on one protein molecule is complementary to another 
region  on  the  surface  of  another  protein  molecule  of  the  same  type. 
Because each protein molecule is bound to its neighbor in an identical 
way  (see  Figure  4–14),  the  molecules  will  often  be  arranged  in  a  helix 
that can be extended indefinitely in either direction (Figure 4–25). This 
type of arrangement can produce an extended protein filament. An actin 
filament, for example, is a long, helical structure formed from many mol-
ecules  of  the  protein  actin  (Figure  4–26).  Actin  is  extremely  abundant 
in eukaryotic cells, where it forms one of the major filament systems of 
the cytoskeleton (discussed in Chapter 17). Other sets of identical pro-
teins associate to form tubes, as in the microtubules of the cytoskeleton 
(Figure 4–27), or cagelike spherical shells, as in the protein coats of virus 
particles (Figure 4–28).

Many large structures, such as viruses and ribosomes, are built from a 
mixture  of  one  or  more  types  of  protein  plus  RNA  or  DNA  molecules. 
These structures can be isolated in pure form and dissociated into their 
constituent macromolecules. It is often possible to mix the isolated com-
ponents back together and watch them reassemble spontaneously into 
the original structure. This demonstrates that all the information needed 
for  assembly  of  the  complicated  structure  is  contained  in  the  macro-
molecules themselves. Experiments of this type show that much of the 

Figure 4–25 Identical protein subunits can assemble into complex 
structures. (a) a protein with just one binding site can form a dimer 
with another identical protein. (B) Identical proteins with two different 
binding sites will often form a long, helical filament. (c) If the two 
binding sites are disposed appropriately in relation to each other, the 
protein subunits will form a closed ring instead of a helix (see also

in the right amounts, the appropriate structures will form automatically.

ECB4 m3.25/4.25

Some Types of proteins have elongated fibrous Shapes
Most of the proteins we have discussed so far are globular proteins, in 
which the polypeptide chain folds up into a compact shape like a ball with 
an irregular surface. Enzymes, for example, tend to be globular proteins: 
even  though  many  are  large  and  complicated,  with  multiple  subunits, 
most  have  a  quaternary  structure  with  an  overall  rounded  shape  (see 
Figure 4–11). In contrast, other proteins have roles in the cell that require 
them  to  span  a  large  distance.  These  proteins  generally  have  a  rela-
tively simple, elongated three-dimensional structure and are commonly 
referred to as fibrous proteins.
One  large  class  of  intracellular  fibrous  proteins  resembles  α-keratin, 
which we met earlier when we introduced the α-helix. Keratin filaments 
are extremely stable: long-lived structures such as hair, horns, and nails 
are composed mainly of this protein. An α-keratin molecule is a dimer 
of two identical subunits, with the long α helices of each subunit form-
ing a coiled-coil (see Figure 4–16). These coiled-coil regions are capped 
at  either  end  by  globular  domains  containing  binding  sites  that  allow 
them  to  assemble  into  ropelike  intermediate  filaments—a  component 
of  the  cytoskeleton  that  gives  cells  mechanical  strength  (discussed  in  
Chapter 17).

Fibrous  proteins  are  especially  abundant  outside  the  cell,  where  they 
form the gel-like extracellular matrix that helps bind cells together to form 
tissues. These proteins are secreted by the cells into their surroundings, 
where they often assemble into sheets or long fibrils. Collagen is the most 
abundant of these fibrous extracellular proteins in animal tissues. A colla-
gen molecule consists of three long polypeptide chains, each containing 
the nonpolar amino acid glycine at every third position. This regular struc-
ture allows the chains to wind around one another to generate a long, 
regular,  triple  helix  with  glycine  at  its  core  (Figure  4–29A).  Many  such

actin filaments (see Figure 4–26), whereas tubulin subunits form hollow microtubules, 
and some virus proteins form a spherical shell (capsid) that encloses the viral genome 
(see Figure 4–28).

collagen molecules bind to one another side-by-side and end-to-end to 
create long overlapping arrays called collagen fibrils, which are extremely 
strong and help hold tissues together, as described in Chapter 20. 

In complete contrast to collagen is another fibrous protein in the extracel-
lular matrix, elastin. Elastin molecules are formed from relatively loose 
and unstructured polypeptide chains that are covalently cross-linked into 
a rubberlike elastic meshwork. The resulting elastic fibers enable skin and 
other  tissues,  such  as  arteries  and  lungs,  to  stretch  and  recoil  without 
tearing. As illustrated in Figure 4–29B, the elasticity is due to the ability 
of  the  individual  protein  molecules  to  uncoil  reversibly  whenever  they 
are stretched.

extracellular proteins are often Stabilized by covalent 
cross-Linkages
Many  protein  molecules  are  either  attached  to  the  outside  of  a  cell’s 
plasma membrane or secreted as part of the extracellular matrix, which 
exposes them to extracellular conditions. To help maintain their struc-
tures,  the  polypeptide  chains  in  such  proteins  are  often  stabilized  by 
covalent cross-linkages. These linkages can either tie together two amino 
acids in the same polypeptide chain or join together many polypeptide 
chains in a large protein complex—as for the collagen fibrils and elastic 
fibers just described.

The  most  common  covalent  cross-links  in  proteins  are  sulfur–sulfur 
bonds. These disulfide bonds (also called S–S bonds) are formed before 
a protein is secreted by an enzyme in endoplasmic reticulum that links 
together two –SH groups from cysteine side chains that are adjacent in the 
folded protein (Figure 4–30). Disulfide bonds do not change a protein’s 
conformation,  but  instead  act  as  a  sort  of  “atomic  staple”  to  reinforce 
the  protein’s  most  favored  conformation.  For  example,  lysozyme—an

by three extended protein chains that wrap around one another. Many rodlike collagen molecules are cross-linked together in the 
extracellular space to form collagen fibrils (top), which have the tensile strength of steel. the striping on the collagen fibril is caused by 
the regular repeating arrangement of the collagen molecules within the fibril. (B) elastin molecules are cross-linked together by covalent 
bonds (red ) to form rubberlike, elastic fibers. each elastin polypeptide chain uncoils into a more extended conformation when the fiber

energy required to break even a whole set

a disulfide bond can have a major stabilizing 
effect on a protein’s folded structure

Disulfide bonds generally do not form in the cell cytosol, where a high 
concentration of reducing agents converts such bonds back to cysteine 
–SH  groups.  Apparently,  proteins  do  not  require  this  type  of  structural 
reinforcement in the relatively mild conditions in the cytosol.

As we have just seen, proteins are made from an enormous variety of 
amino  acid  sequences  and  can  fold  into  a  unique  shape.  The  surface 
topography of a protein’s side chains endows each protein with a unique 
function, based on its chemical properties. The union of structure, chem-
istry, and function gives proteins the extraordinary ability to orchestrate 
the large number of dynamic processes that occur in cells.

Thus,  for  proteins,  form  and  function  are  inextricably  linked.  But  the 
fundamental question remains: How do proteins actually work? In this 
section, we will see that the activity of proteins depends on their ability 
to bind specifically to other molecules, allowing them to act as catalysts, 
structural supports, tiny motors, and so on. The examples we review here 
by no means exhaust the vast functional repertoire of proteins. However, 
the specialized functions of the proteins you will encounter elsewhere in 
this book are based on the same principles.

all proteins Bind to other Molecules
The  biological  properties  of  a  protein  molecule  depend  on  its  physical 
interaction with other molecules. Antibodies attach to viruses or bacteria 
as part of the body’s defenses; the enzyme hexokinase binds glucose and 
ATP to catalyze a reaction between them; actin molecules bind to one 
another to assemble into long filaments; and so on. Indeed, all proteins 
stick, or bind, to other molecules in a specific manner. In some cases, this 
binding is very tight; in others, it is weak and short-lived. As we saw in 
Chapter 3, the affinity of an enzyme for its substrate is reflected in its KM: 
the lower the KM, the tighter the binding. 
Regardless  of  its  strength,  the  binding  of  a  protein  to  other  biological 
molecules always shows great specificity: each protein molecule can bind 
to  just  one  or  a  few  molecules  out  of  the  many  thousands  of  different

Figure 4–31 the binding of a protein to 
another molecule is highly selective. Many 
weak interactions are needed to enable a 
protein to bind tightly to a second molecule 
(a ligand). the ligand must therefore fit 
precisely into the protein’s binding site, like 
a hand into a glove, so that a large number 
of noncovalent interactions can be formed 
between the protein and the ligand.  
(a) Schematic drawing shows the binding of

filling model.

molecules  it  encounters.  Any  substance  that  is  bound  by  a  protein—
whether it is an ion, a small organic molecule, or a macromolecule—is 
referred to as a ligand for that protein (from the Latin ligare, “to bind”).

The ability of a protein to bind selectively and with high affinity to a ligand 
is due to the formation of a set of weak, noncovalent interactions—hydro-
gen bonds, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals attractions—plus 
favorable  hydrophobic  forces  (see  Panel  2–7,  pp.  78–79).  Each  individ-
ual  noncovalent  interaction  is  weak,  so  that  effective  binding  requires 
many such bonds to be formed simultaneously. This is possible only if 
the surface contours of the ligand molecule fit very closely to the protein, 
matching it like a hand in a glove (Figure 4–31).

When molecules have poorly matching surfaces, few noncovalent inter-
actions occur, and the two molecules dissociate as rapidly as they come 
together.  This  is  what  prevents  incorrect  and  unwanted  associations 
from  forming  between  mismatched  molecules.  At  the  other  extreme, 
when  many  noncovalent  interactions  are  formed,  the  association  can 
persist for a very long time. Strong binding between molecules occurs in 
cells whenever a biological function requires that the molecules remain 
tightly associated for a long time—for example, when a group of macro-
molecules come together to form a functional subcellular structure such 
as a ribosome. 

The region of a protein that associates with a ligand, known as its bind-
ing site, usually consists of a cavity in the protein surface formed by a 
particular arrangement of amino acid side chains. These side chains can 
belong to amino acids that are widely separated on the linear polypep-
tide chain, but are brought together when the protein folds (Figure 4–32). 
Other regions on the surface often provide binding sites for different lig-
ands  that  regulate  the  protein’s  activity,  as  we  discuss  later.  Yet  other 
parts of the protein may be required to attract or attach the protein to a 
particular location in the cell—for example, the hydrophobic α helix of a

membrane-spanning protein allows it to be inserted into the lipid bilayer 
of a cell membrane (discussed in Chapter 11).

Although  the  atoms  buried  in  the  interior  of  a  protein  have  no  direct 
contact with the ligand, they provide an essential scaffold that gives the 
surface its contours and chemical properties. Even tiny changes to the 
amino acids in the interior of a protein can change the protein’s three-
dimensional shape and destroy its function.

There are Billions of different antibodies, each with a 
different Binding Site
All proteins must bind to particular ligands to carry out their various func-
tions. For antibodies, the universe of possible ligands is limitless. Each of 
us has the capacity to produce a huge variety of antibodies, among which 
there  will  be  one  that  is  capable  of  recognizing  and  binding  tightly  to 
almost any molecule imaginable.

Antibodies are immunoglobulin proteins produced by the immune sys-
tem  in  response  to  foreign  molecules,  especially  those  on  the  surface 
of an invading microorganism. Each antibody binds to a particular tar-
get molecule extremely tightly, either inactivating the target directly or 
marking it for destruction. An antibody recognizes its target molecule—
called  an  antigen—with  remarkable  specificity,  and,  because  there  are 
potentially billions of different antigens that a person might encounter, 
we have to be able to produce billions of different antibodies. 

Antibodies  are  Y-shaped  molecules  with  two  identical  antigen-binding 
sites, each of which is complementary to a small portion of the surface 
of the antigen molecule. A detailed examination of the antigen-binding 
sites  of  antibodies  reveals  that  they  are  formed  from  several  loops  of 
polypeptide chain that protrude from the ends of a pair of closely juxta-
posed protein domains (Figure 4–33). The amino acid sequence in these

loops  can  vary  greatly  without  altering  the  basic  structure  of  the  anti-
body. An enormous diversity of antigen-binding sites can be generated by 
changing only the length and amino acid sequence of the loops, which is 
how the wide variety of different antibodies is formed (Movie 4.7). 

With their unique combination of specificity and diversity, antibodies are 
not only indispensable for fighting off infections, they are also invaluable 
in the laboratory, where they can be used to identify, purify, and study 
other molecules (Panel 4–2, pp. 146–147).

enzymes are powerful and highly Specific catalysts
For many proteins, binding to another molecule is their main function. 
An  actin  molecule,  for  example,  need  only  associate  with  other  actin 
molecules to form a filament. There are proteins, however, for which lig-
and binding is simply a necessary first step in their function. This is the 
case for the large and very important class of proteins called enzymes. 
These remarkable molecules are responsible for nearly all of the chemi-
cal  transformations  that  occur  in  cells.  Enzymes  bind  to  one  or  more 
ligands,  called  substrates,  and  convert  them  into  chemically  modified 
products, doing this over and over again with amazing rapidity. As we 
saw  in  Chapter  3,  they  speed  up  reactions,  often  by  a  factor  of  a  mil-
lion or more, without themselves being changed—that is, enzymes act as 
catalysts that permit cells to make or break covalent bonds at will. This 
catalysis of organized sets of chemical reactions by enzymes creates and 
maintains the cell, making life possible.

Enzymes  can  be  grouped  into  functional  classes  based  on  the  chemi-
cal  reactions  they  catalyze  (table  4–1).  Each  type  of  enzyme  is  highly 
specific, catalyzing only a single type of reaction. Thus, hexokinase adds 
a phosphate group to  d-glucose but not to its optical isomer  l-glucose; 
the blood-clotting enzyme thrombin cuts one type of blood-clotting pro-
tein between a particular arginine and its adjacent glycine and nowhere

which were discovered and named before the convention became generally accepted at the end of the nineteenth century. the name 
of an enzyme usually indicates the nature of the reaction catalyzed. For example, citrate synthase catalyzes the synthesis of citrate by a 
reaction between acetyl coa and oxaloacetate.

else. As discussed in detail in Chapter 3, enzymes often work in tandem, 
with the product of one enzyme becoming the substrate for the next. The 
result is an elaborate network of metabolic pathways that provides the cell 
with energy and generates the many large and small molecules that the 
cell needs.

Lysozyme illustrates how an enzyme Works
To  explain  how  enzymes  catalyze  chemical  reactions,  we  will  use  the 
example of lysozyme—an enzyme that acts as a natural antibiotic in egg 
white, saliva, tears, and other secretions. Lysozyme severs the polysac-
charide chains that form the cell walls of bacteria. Because the bacterial 
cell is under pressure due to intracellular osmotic forces, cutting even a 
small  number  of  polysaccharide  chains  causes  the  cell  wall  to  rupture 
and the bacterium to burst, or lyse. Lysozyme is a relatively small and 
stable protein, which can be isolated easily in large quantities. For these 
reasons it has been intensively studied, and it was the first enzyme whose 
structure was worked out in atomic detail by X-ray crystallography.

The reaction catalyzed by lysozyme is a hydrolysis: the enzyme adds a 
molecule of water to a single bond between two adjacent sugar groups in 
the polysaccharide chain, thereby causing the bond to break. The reaction 
is energetically favorable because the free energy of the severed polysac-
charide chain is lower than the free energy of the intact chain. However, 
the pure polysaccharide can sit for years in water without being hydro-
lyzed to any detectable degree. This is because there is an energy barrier 
to  such  reactions,  called  the  activation  energy  (discussed  in  Chapter  3, 
pp. 91–93). For a colliding water molecule to break a bond linking two 
sugars, the polysaccharide molecule has to be distorted into a particular 
shape—the transition state—in which the atoms around the bond have 
an altered geometry and electron distribution. To distort the polysaccha-
ride in this way requires a large input of energy from random molecular 
collisions. In aqueous solution at room temperature, the energy of such 
collisions almost never exceeds the activation energy; therefore, hydroly-
sis occurs extremely slowly, if at all.

This is where the enzyme comes in. Like all enzymes, lysozyme has a 
binding site on its surface, termed an active site, that cradles the con-
tours of its substrate molecule. Here, the catalysis of the chemical reaction 
occurs. Because its substrate is a polymer, lysozyme’s active site is a long 
groove  that  holds  six  linked  sugars  in  the  polysaccharide  chain  at  the 
same time. As soon as the enzyme–substrate complex forms, the enzyme 
cuts the polysaccharide by catalyzing the addition of a water molecule to 
one of its sugar–sugar bonds. The severed chain is then quickly released, 
freeing the enzyme for further cycles of cleavage (Figure 4–34).

The chemistry that underlies the binding of lysozyme to its substrate is 
the  same  as  that  for  antibody  binding  to  its  antigen:  the  formation  of

Antibodies are proteins
that bind very tightly to
their targets (antigens).
They are produced in
vertebrates as a defense
against infection. Each
antibody molecule is
made of two identical
light chains and two
identical heavy chains,
so the two antigen-
binding sites are
identical.

An individual human
can make billions of
different antibody
molecules, each with a
distinct antigen-binding
site. Each antibody
recognizes its antigen
with great speciﬁcity.

B CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES
Antibodies are made by a class of white blood cells called B
lymphocytes, or B cells. Each resting B cell carries a different
membrane-bound antibody molecule on its surface that serves
as a receptor for recognizing a speciﬁc antigen. When antigen
binds to this receptor, the B cell is stimulated to divide and to
secrete large amounts of the same antibody in a soluble form.

ES
In the enzyme–substrate complex (ES), the 
enzyme forces sugar D into a strained 
conformation. The Glu 35 in the enzyme is 
positioned to serve as an acid that attacks the 
adjacent sugar–sugar bond by donating a proton 
(H+ ) to sugar E; Asp 52 is  poised to attack the 
C1 carbon atom of sugar D.

Figure 4–35 enzymes bind to, and 
chemically alter, substrate molecules. 
In the active site of lysozyme, a covalent 
bond in a polysaccharide molecule is bent 
and then broken. the top row shows the 
free substrate and the free products. the 
three lower panels depict sequential events 
at the enzyme active site, during which a 
sugar–sugar covalent bond is broken. note 
the change in the conformation of sugar D 
in the enzyme–substrate complex compared 
with the free substrate. this conformation 
favors the formation of the transition state 
shown in the middle panel, greatly lowering 
the activation energy required for the 
reaction. the reaction, and the structure of 
lysozyme bound to its product, are shown in 
Movie 4.8 and Movie 4.9. (Based on 
D.J. Vocadlo et al., Nature 412:835–838, 
2001.)

TRANSITION STATE
The Asp 52 has formed a covalent bond between 
the enzyme and the C1 carbon atom of sugar D. 
The Glu 35 then polarizes a water molecule (red),  
so that its oxygen can readily attack the C1 
carbon atom of sugar D and displace Asp 52.

EP
The reaction of the water molecule (red) 
completes the hydrolysis and returns the enzyme 
to its initial state, forming the ﬁnal enzyme–

multiple noncovalent bonds. However, lysozyme holds its polysaccharide 
substrate in such a way that one of the two sugars involved in the bond 
to be broken is distorted from its normal, most stable conformation. The 
bond to be broken is held close to two specific amino acids with acidic 
side  chains—a  glutamic  acid  and  an  aspartic  acid—located  within  the 
active site of the enzyme. Conditions are thereby created in the microen-
vironment of the lysozyme active site that greatly reduce the activation 
energy necessary for the hydrolysis to take place (Figure 4–35). The over-
all chemical reaction, from the initial binding of the polysaccharide on the 
surface of the enzyme to the final release of the severed chains, occurs 
many millions of times faster than it would in the absence of enzyme.

Other enzymes use similar mechanisms to lower the activation energies 
and speed up the reactions they catalyze. In reactions involving two or 
more  substrates,  the  active  site  also  acts  like  a  template  or  mold  that 
brings the reactants together in the proper orientation for the reaction 
to occur (Figure 4–36A). As we saw for lysozyme, the active site of an 
enzyme contains precisely positioned chemical groups that speed up the 
reaction by altering the distribution of electrons in the substrates (Figure 
4–36B). Binding to the enzyme also changes the shape of the substrate, 
bending  bonds  so  as  to  drive  the  bound  molecule  toward  a  particular 
transition  state  (Figure  4–36C).  Finally,  like  lysozyme,  many  enzymes 
participate intimately in the reaction by briefly forming a covalent bond 
between the substrate and an amino acid side chain in the active site. 
Subsequent  steps  in  the  reaction  restore  the  side  chain  to  its  original 
state, so the enzyme remains unchanged after the reaction and can go on 
to catalyze many more reactions.

Many drugs inhibit enzymes
Many of the drugs we take to treat or prevent illness work by blocking the 
activity of a particular enzyme. Cholesterol-lowering statins inhibit HMG-
CoA  reductase,  an  enzyme  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  cholesterol  by 
the liver. Methotrexate kills some types of cancer cells by shutting down 
dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that produces a compound required 
for  DNA  synthesis  during  cell  division.  Because  cancer  cells  have  lost 
important intracellular control systems, some of them are unusually sen-
sitive to treatments that interrupt chromosome replication, making them 
susceptible to methotrexate.

ECB4 m3.52/4.35

Pharmaceutical companies often develop drugs by first using automated 
methods to screen massive libraries of compounds to find chemicals that 
are able to inhibit the activity of an enzyme of interest. They can then 
chemically modify the most promising compounds to make them even 
more effective, enhancing their binding affinity and specificity for the tar-
get enzyme. As we discuss in Chapter 20, the anticancer drug Gleevec® 
was  designed  to  specifically  inhibit  an  enzyme  whose  aberrant  behav-
ior is required for the growth of a type of cancer called chronic myeloid 
leukemia. The drug binds tightly in the substrate-binding pocket of the 
enzyme, blocking its activity (see Figure 20–56). 

Tightly Bound Small Molecules add extra functions to 
proteins
Although  the  order  of  amino  acids  in  proteins  gives  these  macromol-
ecules their shape and functional versatility, sometimes the amino acids 
by themselves are not enough for a protein to do its job. Just as we use 
tools  to  enhance  and  extend  the  capabilities  of  our  hands,  so  proteins 
often  employ  small,  nonprotein  molecules  to  perform  functions  that 
would be difficult or impossible using amino acids alone. Thus, the pho-
toreceptor  protein  rhodopsin,  which  is  the  light-sensitive  protein  made 
by the rod cells in the retina, detects light by means of a small molecule, 
retinal, which is attached to the protein by a covalent bond to a lysine side 
chain (Figure 4–37A). Retinal changes its shape when it absorbs a photon 
of light, and this change is amplified by rhodopsin to trigger a cascade of 
reactions that eventually leads to an electrical signal being carried to the 
brain. 

Another example of a protein that contains a nonprotein portion essential 
for its function is hemoglobin (see Figure 4–24). A molecule of hemoglobin 
carries  four  noncovalently  bound  heme  groups,  ring-shaped  molecules 
each with a single central iron atom (Figure 4–37B). Heme gives hemo-
globin (and blood) its red color. By binding reversibly to dissolved oxygen 
gas through its iron atom, heme enables hemoglobin to pick up oxygen 
in the lungs and release it in tissues that need it.

When these small molecules are attached to their protein, they become 
an integral part of the protein molecule itself. We discuss in Chapter 11 
how  proteins  can  be  anchored  to  cell  membranes  through  covalently 
attached lipid molecules, and how proteins that are either secreted from 
the cell or bound to its surface can be modified by the covalent addition 
of sugars and oligosaccharides. 

ECB4 m3.53/4.36

Enzymes, too, make use of nonprotein molecules: they frequently have 
a  small  molecule  or  metal  atom  associated  with  their  active  site  that 
assists  with  their  catalytic  function.  Carboxypeptidase,  an  enzyme  that 
cuts polypeptide chains, carries a tightly bound zinc ion in its active site. 
During the cleavage of a peptide bond by carboxypeptidase, the zinc ion 
forms a transient bond with one of the substrate atoms, thereby assist-
ing the hydrolysis reaction. In other enzymes, a small organic molecule 
serves a similar purpose. Biotin, for example, is found in enzymes that 
transfer  a  carboxyl  group  (–COO–)  from  one  molecule  to  another  (see 
Figure 3–37). Biotin participates in these reactions by forming a transient 
covalent bond to the –COO– group to be transferred, thereby forming an 
activated  carrier  (see  Table  3–2,  p.  112).  This  small  molecule  is  better 
suited for this function than any of the amino acids used to make proteins. 
Because biotin cannot be synthesized by humans, it must be provided in 
the diet; thus biotin is classified as a vitamin. Other vitamins are similarly 
needed to make small molecules that are essential components of our 
proteins; vitamin A, for example, is needed in the diet to make retinal, the 
light-sensitive part of rhodopsin just discussed.

hoW proTeinS are conTroLLed
So  far,  we  have  examined  how  proteins  do  their  jobs:  how  binding  to 
other proteins or small molecules allows them to perform their specific 
functions. But inside the cell, most proteins and enzymes do not work 
continuously, or at full speed. Instead, their activities are regulated in a 
coordinated fashion so the cell can maintain itself in an optimal state, 
producing  only  those  molecules  it  requires  to  thrive  under  the  current 
conditions. By coordinating when—and how vigorously—proteins func-
tion,  the  cell  ensures  that  it  does  not  deplete  its  energy  reserves  by 
accumulating molecules it does not need or waste its stockpiles of criti-
cal  substrates.  We  now  consider  how  cells  control  the  activity  of  their 
enzymes and other proteins. 

The regulation of protein activity occurs at many levels. At one level, the 
cell controls the amount of the protein it contains. It can do so by regu-
lating the expression of the gene that encodes that protein (discussed in 
Chapter 8), and by regulating the rate at which the protein is degraded 

(discussed  in  Chapter  7).  At  another  level,  the  cell  controls  enzymatic 
activities  by  confining  sets  of  enzymes  to  particular  subcellular  com-
partments,  often—but  not  always—enclosed  by  distinct  membranes 
(discussed in Chapters 14 and 15). But the most rapid and general mech-
anism used to adjust the activity of a protein occurs at the level of the 
protein  itself.  Although  proteins  can  be  switched  on  or  off  in  various 
ways, as we see next, all of these mechanisms cause the protein to alter 
its shape, and therefore its function.

The catalytic activities of enzymes are often regulated 
by other Molecules
A  living  cell  contains  thousands  of  different  enzymes,  many  of  which 
are operating at the same time in the same small volume of the cytosol. 
By their catalytic action, enzymes generate a complex web of metabolic 
pathways, each composed of chains of chemical reactions in which the 
product of one enzyme becomes the substrate of the next. In this maze of 
pathways, there are many branch points where different enzymes com-
pete  for  the  same  substrate.  The  system  is  so  complex  that  elaborate 
controls  are  required  to  regulate  when  and  how  rapidly  each  reaction 
occurs.
A common type of control occurs when a molecule other than a substrate 
specifically binds to an enzyme at a special regulatory site, altering the 
rate at which the enzyme converts its substrate to product. In feedback 
inhibition, for example, an enzyme acting early in a reaction pathway is 
inhibited by a late product of that pathway. Thus, whenever large quan-
tities of the final product begin to accumulate, the product binds to an 
earlier enzyme and slows down its catalytic action, limiting further entry 
of substrates into that reaction pathway (Figure 4–38). Where pathways 
branch  or  intersect,  there  are  usually  multiple  points  of  control  by  dif-
ferent final products, each of which works to regulate its own synthesis 
(Figure 4–39). Feedback inhibition can work almost instantaneously and 
is rapidly reversed when product levels fall.
Feedback inhibition is a negative regulation: it prevents an enzyme from 
acting. Enzymes can also be subject to positive regulation, in which the 
enzyme’s activity is stimulated by a regulatory molecule rather than being 
suppressed.  Positive  regulation  occurs  when  a  product  in  one  branch 
of the metabolic maze stimulates the activity of an enzyme in another 
pathway. 

allosteric enzymes have Two or More Binding Sites That 
influence one another
One  feature  of  feedback  inhibition  was  initially  puzzling  to  those  who 
discovered it. Unlike what one expects to see for a competitive inhibitor 
(see Figure 3–29), the regulatory molecule often has a shape that is totally 
different  from  the  shape  of  the  enzyme’s  preferred  substrate.  Indeed, 
when this form of regulation was discovered in the 1960s, it was termed 
allostery (from the Greek allo, “other,” and stere, “solid” or “shape”). As 
more  was  learned  about  feedback  inhibition,  researchers  realized  that 
many enzymes must have at least two different binding sites on their sur-
face: the active site that recognizes the substrates and one or more sites 
that recognize regulatory molecules. And that these sites must somehow 
“communicate” to allow the catalytic events at the active site to be influ-
enced by the binding of the regulatory molecule at its separate site. 

The interaction between sites that are located in different regions on a 
protein molecule is now known to depend on conformational changes in 
the protein: binding of a ligand to one of the sites causes a shift in the pro-
tein’s structure from one folded shape to a slightly different folded shape,

ChAPteR 4     protein Structure and Function

Figure 4–39 Feedback inhibition at 
multiple points regulates connected 
metabolic pathways. the biosynthetic 
pathways for four different amino acids in 
bacteria are shown, starting from the amino 
acid aspartate. the red lines indicate points 
at which products feed back to inhibit 
enzymes and the blank boxes represent 
intermediates in each pathway. In this 
example, each amino acid controls the first 
enzyme specific to its own synthesis, thereby 
limiting its own concentrations and avoiding 
a wasteful buildup of intermediates. Some 
of the products also separately inhibit the 
initial set of reactions common to all the 
syntheses. three different enzymes catalyze 
the initial reaction from aspartate to aspartyl 
phosphate, and each of these enzymes is 
inhibited by a different product.

which alters the binding of a ligand to a second site. Many enzymes have 
two conformations that differ in activity, each stabilized by the binding 
of different ligands. During feedback inhibition, for example, the binding 
of an inhibitor at a regulatory site on the protein causes the protein to 
shift to a conformation in which its active site—located elsewhere in the 
protein—becomes less accommodating to the substrate molecule (Figure 
4–40).

MBoC6 m3.57/4.38

Many—if not most—protein molecules are allosteric: they can adopt two 
or more slightly different conformations, and their activity can be regu-
lated by a shift from one to another. This is true not only for enzymes 
but  also  for  many  other  proteins  as  well.  The  chemistry  involved  here 
is extremely simple in concept: because each protein conformation will 
have  somewhat  different  contours  on  its  surface,  the  protein’s  binding 
sites for ligands will be altered when the protein changes shape. Each lig-
and will stabilize the conformation that it binds to most strongly, and at 
high enough concentrations a ligand will tend to “switch” the population 
of proteins to the conformation that it favors (Figure 4–41).

activity involves attaching a phosphate group covalently to one or more 
of the protein’s amino acid side chains. Because each phosphate group 
carries two negative charges, the enzyme-catalyzed addition of a phos-
phate group can cause a major conformational change in a protein by, for 
example, attracting a cluster of positively charged amino acid side chains 
from somewhere else in the same protein. This conformational change 
can, in turn, affect the binding of ligands elsewhere on the protein sur-
face,  thereby  altering  the  protein’s  activity.  Removal  of  the  phosphate 
group by a second enzyme will return the protein to its original confor-
mation and restore its initial activity. 

ECB4 e4.36/4.39

This  reversible  protein  phosphorylation  controls  the  activity  of  many 
types of proteins in eukaryotic cells; indeed, it is used so extensively that 
more than one-third of the 10,000 or so proteins in a typical mamma-
lian cell are phosphorylated at any one time. The addition and removal 
of  phosphate  groups  from  specific  proteins  often  occur  in  response  to 
signals that specify some change in a cell’s state. For example, the com-
plicated series of events that takes place as a eukaryotic cell divides is 
timed  largely  in  this  way  (discussed  in  Chapter  18).  And  many  of  the 
intracellular  signaling  pathways  activated  by  extracellular  signals  such 
as  hormones  depend  on  a  network  of  protein  phosphorylation  events 
(discussed in Chapter 16).

Protein  phosphorylation  involves  the  enzyme-catalyzed  transfer  of  the 
terminal phosphate group of ATP to the hydroxyl group on a serine, thre-
onine,  or  tyrosine  side  chain  of  the  protein.  This  reaction  is  catalyzed

Figure 4–40 Feedback inhibition 
triggers a conformational change in an 
enzyme. the enzyme shown, aspartate 
transcarbamoylase from E. coli, was used 
in early studies of allosteric regulation. 
this large multisubunit enzyme (see Figure 
4–11) catalyzes an important reaction that 
begins the synthesis of the pyrimidine 
ring of c, U, and t nucleotides (see panel 
2–6, p. 76–77). One of the final products of 
this pathway, cytosine triphosphate (ctp), 
binds to the enzyme to turn it off whenever 
ctp is plentiful. this diagram shows the 
conformational change that occurs when the 
enzyme is turned off by ctp binding to its 
four regulatory sites, which are distinct from 
the active site where the substrate binds. 
note that the aspartate transcarbamoylase 
shown in Figure 4–11 is seen from the top. 
this figure depicts the enzyme as seen from 
the side.

example, to sense when aDp is building up 
in the cell—which is usually a sign that atp 
is decreasing. In this way, the increase in 
aDp would increase the oxidation of sugars 
to provide more energy for the synthesis 
of atp from aDp—an example of positive 
regulation.

Figure 4–42 Protein phosphorylation is a 
very common mechanism for regulating 
protein activity. Many thousands of 
proteins in a typical eukaryotic cell are 
modified by the covalent addition of one 
or more phosphate groups. (a) the general 
reaction, shown here, entails transfer of a 
phosphate group from atp to an amino 
acid side chain of the target protein by a 
protein kinase. removal of the phosphate 
group is catalyzed by a second enzyme, a 
protein phosphatase. In this example, the 
phosphate is added to a serine side chain; 
in other cases, the phosphate is instead 
linked to the –Oh group of a threonine or 
tyrosine side chain. (B) phosphorylation 
can either increase or decrease the 
protein’s activity, depending on the site of 
phosphorylation and the structure of the 
protein.

by  a  protein  kinase.  The  reverse  reaction—removal  of  the  phosphate 
group,  or  dephosphorylation—is  catalyzed  by  a  protein  phosphatase 
(Figure 4–42A). Phosphorylation can either stimulate protein activity or 
inhibit it, depending on the protein involved and the site of phosphoryla-
tion (Figure 4–42B). Cells contain hundreds of different protein kinases, 
each  responsible  for  phosphorylating  a  different  protein  or  set  of  pro-
teins. Cells also contain a smaller set of different protein phosphatases; 
some of these are highly specific and remove phosphate groups from only 
one or a few proteins, whereas others act on a broad range of proteins. 
The state of phosphorylation of a protein at any moment in time, and thus 
its  activity,  will  depend  on  the  relative  activities  of  the  protein  kinases 
and phosphatases that act on it.

For  many  proteins,  a  phosphate  group  is  added  to  a  particular  side 
chain and then removed in a continuous cycle. Phosphorylation cycles 
of this kind allow proteins to switch rapidly from one state to another. 
The more rapidly the cycle is “turning,” the faster the concentration of a 
phosphorylated protein can change in response to a sudden stimulus that 
increases its rate of phosphorylation. However, keeping the cycle turning 
costs energy, because one molecule of ATP is hydrolyzed with each turn 
of the cycle. 

covalent Modifications also control the Location and 
interaction of proteins 
Phosphorylation  can  do  more  than  control  a  protein’s  activity;  it  can 
create docking sites where other proteins can bind, thus promoting the 
assembly of proteins into larger complexes. For example, when extracel-
lular  signals  stimulate  a  class  of  cell-surface,  transmembrane  proteins 
called receptor tyrosine kinases, they cause the receptor proteins to phos-
phorylate themselves on certain tyrosines. The phosphorylated tyrosines 
then  serve  as  docking  sites  for  the  binding  and  activation  of  various 
intracellular signaling proteins, which pass along the message to the cell 
interior and change the behavior of the cell (see Figure 16–32). 

Phosphorylation  is  not  the  only  form  of  covalent  modification  that  can 
affect  a  protein’s  activity  or  location.  More  than  100  types  of  covalent 
modifications can occur in the cell, each playing its own role in regulat-
ing  protein  function.  Many  proteins  are  modified  by  the  addition  of  an 
acetyl  group  to  a  lysine  side  chain.  And  the  addition  of  the  fatty  acid 
palmitate to a cysteine side chain drives a protein to associate with cell 
membranes. Attachment of ubiquitin, a 76-amino-acid polypeptide, can 
target a protein for degradation, as we discuss in Chapter 7. Each of these 
modifying groups is enzymatically added or removed depending on the 
needs of the cell.

A large number of proteins are modified on more than one amino acid 
side chain. The p53 protein, which plays a central part in controling how 
a cell responds to DNA damage and other stresses, can be modified at 
20 sites (Figure 4–43). Because an enormous number of combinations of 
these 20 modifications is possible, the protein’s behavior can in principle 
be altered in a huge number of ways.

The set of covalent modifications that a protein contains at any moment 
constitutes an important form of regulation. The attachment or removal 
of these modifying groups controls the behavior of a protein, changing its 
activity or stability, its binding partners, or its location inside the cell. In 
some cases, the modification alters the protein’s conformation; in others, 
it serves as a docking site for other proteins to attach. This layer of con-
trol enables the cell to make optimal use of its proteins, and it allows the 
cell to respond rapidly to changes in its environment.

GTp-Binding proteins are also regulated by the cyclic 
Gain and Loss of a phosphate Group
Eukaryotic cells have a second way to regulate protein activity by phos-
phate addition and removal. In this case, however, the phosphate is not 
enzymatically transferred from ATP to the protein. Instead, the phosphate 
is  part  of  a  guanine  nucleotide—guanosine  triphosphate  (GTP)—that  is 
bound tightly to various types of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins 
act  as  molecular  switches:  they  are  in  their  active  conformation  when 
GTP is bound, but they can hydrolyze this GTP to GDP, which releases a 
phosphate and flips the protein to an inactive conformation. As with pro-
tein phosphorylation, this process is reversible: the active conformation 
is regained by dissociation of the GDP, followed by the binding of a fresh 
molecule of GTP (Figure 4–44).

ECB4 e4.44/4.42

A  large  variety  of  such  GTP-binding  proteins  function  as  molecular 
switches in cells. The dissociation of GDP and its replacement by GTP, 
which  turns  the  switch  on,  is  often  stimulated  in  response  to  a  signal 
received by the cell. The GTP-binding proteins in turn bind to other pro-
teins to control their activities; their crucial role in intracellular signaling 
pathways is discussed in detail in Chapter 16. 

aTp hydrolysis allows Motor proteins to produce directed 
Movements in cells 
We  have  seen  how  conformational  changes  in  proteins  play  a  central 
part in enzyme regulation and cell signaling. But conformational changes 
also play another important role in the operation of the eukaryotic cell: 
they enable certain specialized proteins to drive directed movements of 
cells and their components. These motor proteins generate the forces 
responsible for muscle contraction and most other eukaryotic cell move-
ments. They also power the intracellular movements of organelles and 
macromolecules. For example, they help move chromosomes to opposite 
ends of the cell during mitosis (discussed in Chapter 18), and they move 
organelles along cytoskeletal tracks (discussed in Chapter 17). 

How are shape changes in proteins used to generate such orderly move-
ments? If, for example, a protein is required to walk along a cytoskeletal 
fiber,  it  can  move  by  undergoing  a  series  of  conformational  changes. 
However,  with  nothing  to  drive  these  changes  in  an  orderly  sequence, 
the shape changes will be perfectly reversible. Thus the protein can only 
wander randomly back and forth (Figure 4–45).

explain how phosphorylation and 
the binding of a nucleotide (such as 
aTp or GTp) can both be used to 
regulate protein activity. What do 
you suppose are the advantages of 
either form of regulation?

Figure 4–44 GtP-binding proteins 
function as molecular switches. a Gtp-
binding protein requires the presence 
of a tightly bound Gtp molecule to be 
active (switch ON). the active protein can 
shut itself off by hydrolyzing its bound 
Gtp to GDp and inorganic phosphate (pi), 
which converts the protein to an inactive 
conformation (switch OFF). to reactivate 
the protein, the tightly bound GDp must 
dissociate, a slow step that can be greatly 
accelerated by specific signals; once the 
GDp dissociates, a molecule of Gtp quickly 
replaces it, returning the protein to its active 
conformation.

156 

ChAPteR 4     protein Structure and Function

Figure 4–45 Changes in conformation can allow a protein to 
“walk” along a cytoskeletal filament. this protein’s three different 
conformations allow it to wander randomly back and forth while bound 
to a filament. Without an input of energy to drive its movement in a 
single direction, the protein will only shuffle aimlessly, getting nowhere.

To make the conformational changes unidirectional—and force the entire 
cycle  of  movement  to  proceed  in  one  direction—it  is  enough  to  make 
any one of the steps irreversible. For most proteins that are able to move 
in  a  single  direction  for  long  distances,  this  irreversibility  is  achieved 
by coupling one of the conformational changes to the hydrolysis of an 
ATP  molecule  bound  to  the  protein—which  is  why  motor  proteins  are 
also ATPases. A great deal of free energy is released when ATP is hydro-
lyzed,  making  it  very  unlikely  that  the  protein  will  undergo  a  reverse 
shape change—as required for moving backward. (Such a reversal would 
require that the ATP hydrolysis be reversed, by adding a phosphate mol-
ecule to ADP to form ATP.) As a consequence, the protein moves steadily 
forward (Figure 4–46).
Many  motor  proteins  generate  directional  movement  by  using  the 
hydrolysis of a tightly bound ATP molecule to drive an orderly series of 
conformational  changes.  These  movements  can  be  rapid:  the  muscle 
motor protein myosin walks along actin filaments at about 6 μm/sec dur-
ing muscle contraction (as discussed in Chapter 17).

proteins often form Large complexes That function as 
protein Machines
As one progresses from small, single-domain proteins to large proteins 
formed from many domains, the functions that the proteins can perform 
become more elaborate. The most complex tasks, however, are carried 
out  by  large  protein  assemblies  formed  from  many  protein  molecules. 
Now that it is possible to reconstruct biological processes in cell-free sys-
tems in a test tube, it is clear that each central process in a cell—including 
DNA replication, gene transcription, protein synthesis, vesicle budding, 
and  transmembrane  signaling—is  catalyzed  by  a  highly  coordinated, 
linked set of many proteins. In most such protein machines, the hydrol-
ysis of bound nucleoside triphosphates (ATP or GTP) drives an ordered 
series of conformational changes in some of the individual protein subu-
nits, enabling the ensemble of proteins to move coordinately. In this way, 
the appropriate enzymes can be positioned to carry out successive reac-
tions in a series—as during the synthesis of proteins on a ribosome, for 
example (discussed in Chapter 7). Likewise, a large multiprotein complex 
moves rapidly along DNA to replicate the DNA double helix during cell 
division (discussed in Chapter 6). A simple mechanical analogy is illus-
trated in Figure 4–47.
Cells have evolved a large number of different protein machines suited to 
performing a variety of biological tasks. Cells employ protein machines 
for  the  same  reason  that  humans  have  invented  mechanical  and  elec-
tronic machines: for almost any job, manipulations that are spatially and 
temporally coordinated through linked processes are much more efficient 
than is the sequential use of individual tools.

Figure 4–46 A schematic model of how a motor protein uses AtP 
hydrolysis to move in one direction along a cytoskeletal filament. an 
orderly transition among three conformations is driven by the hydrolysis 
of a bound atp molecule and the release of the products: aDp and 
inorganic phosphate (pi). Because these transitions are coupled to the 
hydrolysis of atp, the entire cycle is essentially irreversible. through 
repeated cycles, the protein moves continuously to the right along 
the filament. the movement of a single molecule of myosin has been 
captured by atomic force microscopy.

explain why the hypothetical 
enzymes in figure 4–47 have a 
great advantage in opening the 
safe if they work together in a 
protein complex, as opposed to 
working individually in an unlinked, 
sequential manner.

Figure 4–47 “Protein machines” can carry out complex functions. these 
machines are made of individual proteins that collaborate to perform a specific 
task (Movie 4.11). the movement of these proteins is often coordinated by the 
hydrolysis of a bound nucleotide such as atp. conformational changes of this type 
are especially useful to the cell if they occur in a large protein assembly in which 
the activities of several different protein molecules can be coordinated by the 
movements within the complex.

hoW proTeinS are STudied
Understanding how a particular protein functions calls for detailed struc-
tural and biochemical analyses—both of which require large amounts of 
pure  protein.  But  isolating  a  single  type  of  protein  from  the  thousands 
of other proteins present in a cell is a formidable task. For many years, 
proteins had to be purified directly from the source—the tissues in which 
they are most plentiful. That approach was inconvenient, entailing, for 
example, early-morning trips to the slaughterhouse. More important, the 
complexity  of  intact  tissues  and  organs  is  a  major  disadvantage  when 
trying to purify particular molecules, because a long series of chromatog-
raphy steps is generally required. These procedures not only take weeks 
to perform, but they also yield only a few milligrams of pure protein.

Nowadays, proteins are more often isolated from cells that are grown in 
a laboratory (see, for example, Figure 1–38). Often these cells have been 
“tricked” into making large quantities of a given protein using the genetic 
engineering techniques that we describe in Chapter 10. Such engineered 
cells  frequently  allow  large  amounts  of  pure  protein  to  be  obtained  in 
only a few days.

In this section, we outline how proteins are extracted and purified from 
cultured  cells  and  other  sources.  We  describe  how  these  proteins  are 
analyzed to determine their amino acid sequence and their three-dimen-
sional structure. Finally, we discuss how technical advances are allowing 
proteins to be analyzed, cataloged, manipulated, and even designed from 
scratch. 

proteins can be purified from cells or Tissues
Whether starting with a piece of liver, a dish of cultured cells, or a vat 
of  bacterial,  yeast,  or  animal  cells  that  have  been  engineered  to  pro-
duce a protein of interest, the first step in any purification procedure is 
to break open the cells to release their contents. The resulting slurry is 
called a cell homogenate or extract. This physical disruption is followed by 
an initial fractionation procedure to separate out the class of molecules 
of interest—for example, all the soluble proteins in the cell (Panel 4–3, 
pp. 164–165). 

With  this  collection  of  proteins  in  hand,  the  job  is  then  to  isolate  the 
desired  protein.  The  standard  approach  involves  purifying  the  protein

Figure 4–48 Affinity chromatography can be used to isolate the 
binding partners of a protein of interest. the purified protein 
of interest (protein X) is covalently attached to the matrix of a 
chromatography column. an extract containing a mixture of proteins 
is then loaded onto the column. those proteins that associate with 
protein X inside the cell will usually bind to it on the column. proteins 
not bound to the column pass right through, and the proteins that are 
bound tightly to protein X can then be released by changing the ph or 
ionic composition of the washing solution. 

through a series of chromatography steps, which use different materials 
to  separate  the  individual  components  of  a  complex  mixture  into  por-
tions, or fractions, based on the properties of the protein—such as size, 
shape, or electrical charge. After each separation step, the fractions are 
examined to determine which ones contain the protein of interest. These 
fractions  are  then  pooled  and  subjected  to  additional  chromatography 
steps until the desired protein is obtained in pure form. 

The most efficient forms of protein chromatography separate polypeptides 
on the basis of their ability to bind to a particular molecule—a process 
called  affinity  chromatography  (Panel  4–4,  p.  166).  If  large  amounts  of 
antibodies that recognize the protein are available, for example, they can 
be attached to the matrix of a chromatography column and used to help 
extract the protein from a mixture (see Panel 4–2, pp. 146–147).

Affinity chromatography can also be used to isolate proteins that interact 
physically with the protein being studied. In this case, a purified protein 
of interest is attached tightly to the column matrix; the proteins that bind 
to it will remain in the column and can then be removed by changing the 
composition of the washing solution (Figure 4–48). 
Proteins can also be separated by electrophoresis. In this technique, a 
mixture  of  proteins  is  loaded  onto  a  polymer  gel  and  subjected  to  an 
electric field; the polypeptides will then migrate through the gel at differ-
ent speeds depending on their size and net charge (Panel 4–5, p. 167). If 
too many proteins are present in the sample, or if the proteins are very 
similar in their migration rate, they can be resolved further using two-
dimensional  gel  electrophoresis  (see  Panel  4–5).  These  electrophoretic 
approaches yield a number of bands or spots that can be visualized by 
staining; each band or spot contains a different protein. Chromatography 
and electrophoresis—both developed more than 50 years ago but greatly 
improved  since—have  been  instrumental  in  building  an  understanding 
of what proteins look like and how they behave (table 4–2). Both tech-
niques are still frequently used in laboratories.

Once a protein has been obtained in pure form, it can be used in bio-
chemical assays to study the details of its activity. It can also be subjected 
to  techniques  that  reveal  its  amino  acid  sequence  and  precise  three-
dimensional structure.

determining a protein’s Structure Begins with  
determining its amino acid Sequence 
The  task  of  determining  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  a  protein  can  be 
accomplished in several ways. For many years, sequencing a protein was 
done by directly analyzing the amino acids in the purified protein. First, 
the protein was broken down into smaller pieces using a selective pro-
tease;  the  enzyme  trypsin,  for  example,  cleaves  polypeptide  chains  on 
the  carboxyl  side  of  a  lysine  or  an  arginine.  Then  the  identities  of  the 
amino acids in each fragment were determined chemically. The first pro-
tein sequenced in this way was the hormone insulin, in 1955.

1996–2013

Mann, aebersold, Yates, and others developed efficient methods for using mass spectrometry to identify proteins 
in complex mixtures, exploiting the availability of complete genome sequences.

A much faster way to determine the amino acid sequence of proteins that 
have been isolated from organisms for which the full genome sequence is 
known is a method called mass spectrometry. This technique determines 
the exact mass of every peptide fragment in a purified protein, which then 
allows the protein to be identified from a database that contains a list of 
every protein thought to be encoded by the genome of the organism in 
question. Such lists are computed by taking the genome sequence of the 
organism and applying the genetic code (discussed in Chapter 7).

To perform mass spectrometry, the peptides derived from digestion with 
trypsin are blasted with a laser. This treatment heats the peptides, caus-
ing them to become electrically charged (ionized) and ejected in the form 
of a gas. Accelerated by a powerful electric field, the peptide ions then fly 
toward a detector; the time it takes them to arrive is related to their mass 
and their charge. (The larger the peptide is, the more slowly it moves; the

Figure 4–49 Mass spectrometry can be used to identify proteins 
by determining the precise masses of peptides derived from 
them. as indicated, this in turn allows the proteins to be produced in 
the large amounts needed for determining their three-dimensional 
structure. In this example, the protein of interest is excised from a 
polyacrylamide gel after two-dimensional electrophoresis (see panel 
4–5, p. 167) and then digested with trypsin. the peptide fragments 
are loaded into the mass spectrometer, and their exact masses are 
measured. Genome sequence databases are then searched to find the 
protein encoded by the organism in question whose profile matches 
this peptide fingerprint. Mixtures of proteins can also be analyzed in 
this way. (Image courtesy of patrick O’Farrell.)

more highly charged it is, the faster it moves.) The set of exact masses of 
the protein fragments produced by trypsin cleavage then serves as a “fin-
gerprint”  that  identifies  the  protein—and  its  corresponding  gene—from 
publicly accessible databases (Figure 4–49). 

This  approach  can  even  be  applied  to  complex  mixtures  of  proteins, 
for  example,  starting  with  an  extract  containing  all  the  proteins  made 
by yeast cells grown under a particular set of conditions. To obtain the 
increased  resolution  required  to  distinguish  individual  proteins,  such 
mixtures are frequently analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. In this 
case,  after  the  peptides  pass  through  the  first  mass  spectrometer,  they 
are broken into even smaller fragments and analyzed by a second mass 
spectrometer. 

Although all the information required for a polypeptide chain to fold is 
contained in its amino acid sequence, we have not yet learned how to 
reliably predict a protein’s detailed three-dimensional conformation—the 
spatial arrangement of its atoms—from its sequence alone. At present, 
the only way to discover the precise folding pattern of any protein is by 
experiment,  using  either  X-ray  crystallography  or  nuclear  magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (how We know, pp. 162–163).

Genetic engineering Techniques permit the Large-Scale 
production, design, and analysis of almost any protein
Advances in genetic engineering techniques now permit the production 
of large quantities of almost any desired protein. In addition to making 
life much easier for biochemists interested in purifying specific proteins, 
this ability to churn out huge quantities of a protein has given rise to an 
entire biotechnology industry (Figure 4–50). Bacteria, yeast, and cultured 
mammalian cells are now used to mass produce a variety of therapeutic 
proteins, such as insulin, human growth hormone, and even the fertility-
enhancing drugs used to boost egg production in women undergoing in 
vitro  fertilization.  Preparing  these  proteins  previously  required  the  col-
lection  and  processing  of  vast  amounts  of  tissue  and  other  biological 
products—including, in the case of the fertility drugs, the urine of post-
menopausal nuns.

The same sorts of genetic engineering techniques can also be employed 
to produce new proteins and enzymes that contain novel structures or 
perform  unusual  tasks:  metabolizing  toxic  wastes,  synthesizing  life-
saving  drugs,  or  operating  under  conditions  that  would  destroy  most 
biological  catalysts  (see  Chapter  3  How  We  Know,  pp.  104–106).  Most 
of  these  synthetic  catalysts  are  nowhere  near  as  effective  as  naturally 
occurring enzymes in terms of their ability to speed the rate of selected 
chemical reactions. But, as we continue to learn more about how pro-
teins and enzymes exploit their unique conformations to carry out their 
biological functions, our ability to make novel proteins with useful func-
tions can only improve.

Of course, to be able to study—or benefit from—the activity of an engi-
neered protein in a living organism, the DNA encoding that protein must 
somehow be introduced into cells. Again, thanks to genetic engineering 
techniques, we are able to do just that. We discuss these methods in great 
detail in Chapter 10.

The relatedness of proteins aids the prediction of protein 
Structure and function 
Biochemists have made enormous progress in understanding the struc-
ture  and  function  of  proteins  over  the  past  150  years  (see  Table  4–2,  
p. 159). These advances are the fruits of decades of painstaking research 
on isolated proteins, performed by individual scientists working tirelessly 
on  single  proteins  or  protein  families,  one  by  one,  sometimes  for  their 
entire careers. In the future, however, more and more of these investiga-
tions of protein conformation and activity will likely take place on a larger 
scale. 

Improvements  in  our  ability  to  rapidly  sequence  whole  genomes,  and 
the  development  of  methods  such  as  mass  spectrometry,  have  fueled 
our  ability  to  determine  the  amino  acid  sequences  of  enormous  num-
bers  of  proteins.  Millions  of  unique  protein  sequences  from  thousands 
of  different  species  have  thereby  been  deposited  into  publicly  avail-
able  databases,  and  the  collection  is  expected  to  double  in  size  every 
two years. Comparing the amino acid sequences of all of these proteins 
reveals  that  the  majority  belong  to  protein  families  that  share  specific 
“sequence  patterns”—stretches  of  amino  acids  that  fold  into  distinct 
structural domains. In some of these families, the proteins contain only a 
single structural domain. In others, the proteins include multiple domains 
arranged in novel combinations (Figure 4–51). 

Although  the  number  of  multidomain  families  is  growing  rapidly,  the 
discovery  of  novel  single  domains  appears to  be  leveling  off.  This  pla-
teau suggests that the vast majority of proteins may fold up into a limited 
number of structural domains—perhaps as few as 10,000 to 20,000. For 
many single-domain families, the structure of at least one family member 
is known. And knowing the structure of one family member allows us 
to say something about the structure of its relatives. By this account, we 
have some structural information for almost three-quarters of the pro-
teins archived in databases (Movie 4.13).

A future goal is to acquire the ability to look at a protein’s amino acid 
sequence  and  be  able  to  deduce  its  structure  and  gain  insight  into  its 
function.  We  are  coming  closer  to  being  able  to  predict  protein  struc-
ture based on sequence information, but there is still a long way to go. 
Predicting how a protein will function, alone, as part of a complex, or as 
part of a network in the cell, is much more challenging. But, the closer we 
get to addressing these questions, the closer we should be to understand-
ing the fundamental basis of life. 

Figure 4–51 Most proteins belong to structurally related families. 
(a) More than two-thirds of all well-studied proteins contain a single 
structural domain. the members of these single-domain families 
can have different amino acid sequences but fold into a protein 
with a similar shape. (B) During evolution, structural domains have 
been combined in different ways to produce families of multidomain 
proteins. almost all novelty in protein structure comes from the way 
these single domains are arranged. the number of multidomain 
families being added to the public databases is still rapidly increasing, 
unlike the number of novel single domains.

As  you’ve  no  doubt  already  concluded  in  reading  this 
chapter,  for  many  proteins,  their  three-dimensional 
shape determines their function. So to learn more about 
how  a  protein  works,  it  helps  to  know  exactly  what  it 
looks like. 

The  problem  is  that  most  proteins  are  too  small  to  be 
seen in any detail, even with a powerful electron micro-
scope.  To  follow  the  path  of  an  amino  acid  chain  that 
is  folded  into  a  protein  molecule,  you  need  to  be  able 
to  “see”  its  individual  atoms.  Scientists  use  two  main 
methods  to  map  the  locations  of  atoms  in  a  protein. 
The  first  involves  the  use  of  X-rays.  Like  light,  X-rays 
are a form of electromagnetic radiation. But they have a 
wavelength that’s much shorter: 0.1 nanometer (nm) as 
opposed to the 400–700 nm wavelength of visible light. 
That tiny wavelength—which is the approximate diam-
eter of a hydrogen atom—allows scientists to probe the 
structure of very small objects at the atomic level.

A  second  method,  called  nuclear  magnetic  resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy, takes advantage of the fact that—
in  many  atoms—the  nucleus  is  intrinsically  magnetic. 
When exposed to a large magnet, these nuclei act like 
tiny  bar  magnets  and  align  themselves  with  the  mag-
netic field. If they are then excited with a blast of radio 
waves,  the  nuclei  will  wobble  around  their  magnetic 
axes, and, as they relax back into the aligned position, 
they will give off a signal that can be used to reveal their 
relative positions in a protein. 

Using these techniques, investigators have painstakingly 
pieced  together  many  thousands  of  protein  structures. 
With the help of computer graphics programs, they have 
been able to traverse the surfaces and climb inside these 
proteins,  exploring  the  nooks  where  ATP  likes  to  nes-
tle, for example, or examining the loops and helices that 
proteins use to grab hold of a ligand or wrap around a 
segment of DNA. If the protein happens to belong to a 
virus or to a cancer cell, seeing its structure can provide 
clues to designing drugs that might thwart an infection 
or eliminate a tumor. 

X-rays
To  determine  a  protein’s  structure  using  X-ray  crystal-
lography, you first need to coax the protein into forming 
crystals: large, highly ordered arrays of the pure protein 
in which every molecule has the same conformation and 
is  perfectly  aligned  with  its  neighbors.  Growing  high-
quality protein crystals is still something of an art and 
is  largely  a  matter  of  trial  and  error.  Although  robotic 
methods increase efficiency, it can still take years to find 
the  right  conditions—and  some  proteins  resist  crystal-
lization altogether.

If  you’re  lucky  enough  to  get  good  crystals,  you  are 
ready  for  the  X-ray  analysis.  When  a  narrow  beam  of 
X-rays is directed at a protein crystal, the atoms in the 
protein  molecules  scatter  the  incoming  X-rays.  These 
scattered waves either reinforce or cancel one another, 
producing a complex diffraction pattern that is collected 
by  electronic  detectors.  The  position  and  intensity 
of  each  spot  in  the  diffraction  pattern  contains  infor-
mation  about  the  position  of  the  atoms  in  the  protein 
crystal (Figure 4–52).

Because  these  patterns  are  so  complex—even  a  small 
protein can generate 25,000 discrete spots—computers 
are used to interpret them and transform them by com-
plex mathematical calculations into maps of the relative 
spatial positions of the atoms. By combining information 
obtained from such maps with the amino acid sequence 
of  the  protein,  you  can  eventually  generate  an  atomic 
model of the protein’s structure. To determine whether 
the  protein  undergoes  conformational  changes  in  its 
structure when it binds a ligand that boosts its activity, 
you  might  subsequently  try  crystallizing  it  in  the  pres-
ence of its ligand. With crystals of sufficient quality, even 
small atomic movements can be detected by comparing 
the structures obtained in the presence and absence of 
stimulatory or inhibitory ligands.

Magnets
The trouble with X-ray crystallography is that you need 
crystals. And not all proteins like to form such orderly 
assemblies. Many have intrinsically disordered regions 
that wiggle around too much to stack neatly into a crys-
talline array. Others might not crystallize in the absence 
of the membranes in which they normally reside. 

The other way to solve the structure of a protein does 
not require protein crystals. If the protein is small—say, 
50,000 daltons or less—you can determine its structure 
by NMR spectroscopy. In this technique, a concentrated 
solution of pure protein is placed in a strong magnetic 
field and then bombarded with radio waves of different 
frequencies. Hydrogen nuclei, in particular, will gener-
ate  an  NMR  signal  that  can  be  used  to  determine  the 
distances between these atoms in different parts of the 
protein. This information is then used to build a model 
of  how  the  hydrogens  are  arranged  in  space.  Again, 
combined  with  the  known  amino  acid  sequence,  an 
NMR  spectrum  can  allow  you  to  compute  the  three-
dimensional  structure  of  the  protein  (Figure  4–53).  If 
the protein is larger than 50,000 daltons, you can try to 
break it up into its constituent functional domains and 
analyze each domain by NMR.

Because determining the precise conformation of a pro-
tein is so time-consuming and costly—and the resulting 
insights  so  valuable—scientists  routinely  make  their 
structures  freely  available  by  submitting  the  informa-
tion  to  a  publicly  accessible  database.  Thanks  to  such 
databases,  anyone  interested  in  viewing  the  structure 
of,  say,  the  ribosome—a  complex  macromolecular 
machine made of several RNAs and more than 50 pro-
teins—can easily do so. In the future, improvements in 

X-ray  crystallography  and  NMR  spectroscopy  should 
permit  rapid  analysis  of  many  more  proteins  and  pro-
tein machines. And once enough structures have been 
determined, it might become possible to generate algo-
rithms for accurately predicting structure solely on the 
basis of a protein’s amino acid sequence. After all, it is 
the sequence of the amino acids alone that determines 
how  each  protein  folds  up  into  its  three-dimensional 
shape.

BREAKING CELLS AND TISSUES
The ﬁrst step in the 
puriﬁcation of most 
proteins is to disrupt 
tissues and cells in a 
controlled fashion.

Using gentle mechanical procedures, called homogenization,
the plasma membranes of cells can be ruptured so that the cell
contents are released. Four commonly used procedures are
shown here.

The resulting thick soup (called
a homogenate or an extract)
contains large and small molecules
from the cytosol, such as enzymes,
ribosomes, and metabolites, as well
as all of the membrane-enclosed
organelles.

Centrifugation is the most widely used procedure to separate a 
homogenate into different parts, or fractions. The homogenate is 
placed in test tubes and rotated at high speed in a centrifuge or 
ultracentrifuge. Present-day ultracentrifuges rotate at speeds up 
to 100,000 revolutions per minute and produce enormous forces, 
as high as 600,000 times gravity.

Such speeds require centrifuge chambers to be refrigerated and  
have the air evacuated so that friction does not heat up the 
homogenate. The centrifuge is surrounded by thick armor plating, 
because an unbalanced rotor can shatter with an explosive release 
of energy. A ﬁxed-angle rotor can hold larger volumes than a 
swinging-arm rotor, but the pellet forms less evenly, as shown.

DIFFERENTIAL CENTRIFUGATION

Repeated centrifugation at progressively
higher speeds will fractionate cell 
homogenates into their components.

Centrifugation separates cell components on the basis of size and density. The larger
and denser components experience the greatest centrifugal force and move most
rapidly. They sediment to form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, while smaller, less 
dense components remain in suspension above, a portion called the supernatant.

Subcellular components sediment at different rates according to their 
size after being carefully layered over a dilute salt solution and then 
centrifuged through it. In order to stabilize the sedimenting 
components against convective mixing in the tube, the solution contains 
a continuous shallow gradient of sucrose that increases in concentration 
toward the bottom of the tube. The gradient is typically 5→20% 
sucrose. When sedimented through such a dilute sucrose gradient, using 
a swinging-arm rotor, different cell components separate into distinct 
bands that can be collected individually.

rack movement

After an appropriate centrifugation time, the
bands may be collected, most simply by 
puncturing the plastic centrifuge tube and
collecting drops from the bottom, as shown here.

EQUILIBRIUM SEDIMENTATION

The ultracentrifuge can also be used to 
separate cell components on the basis of their
buoyant density, independently of their
size or shape. The sample is usually either
layered on top of, or dispersed within, a
steep density gradient that contains a
very high concentration of sucrose or cesium
chloride. Each subcellular component will
move up or down when centrifuged until it
reaches a position where its density matches
its surroundings and then will move no further.
A series of distinct bands will eventually be
produced, with those nearest the bottom of the
tube containing the components of highest
buoyant density. The method is also called
density gradient centrifugation.

The sample is distributed
throughout the sucrose
density gradient.

At equilibrium, components
have migrated to a region in
the gradient that matches 
their own density.

Proteins are very diverse. They differ in
size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, and
their afﬁnity for other molecules. All of 
these properties can be exploited to
separate them from one another so
that they can be studied individually.

THREE KINDS OF
CHROMATOGRAPHY

Although the material used to form 
the matrix for column chromatography 
varies, it is usually packed in the 
column in the form of small beads. 
A typical protein puriﬁcation strategy 
might employ in turn each of the 
three kinds of matrix described 
below, with a ﬁnal protein 
puriﬁcation of up to 10,000-fold.
   Purity can easily be assessed by gel 
electrophoresis (Panel 4–5).

Proteins are often fractionated by column chromatography. A mixture of proteins in 
solution is applied to the top of a cylindrical column ﬁlled with a permeable solid 
matrix immersed in solvent. A large amount of solvent is then pumped through the 
column. Because different proteins are retarded to different extents by their 
interaction with the matrix, they can be collected separately as they ﬂow out from 
the bottom. According to the choice of matrix, proteins can be separated according 
to their charge, hydrophobicity, size, or ability to bind to particular chemical 
groups (see below ).

(C)   AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY

Ion-exchange columns are packed with 
small beads carrying either positive or 
negative charges that retard proteins 
of the opposite charge. The association 
between a protein and the matrix 
depends on the pH and ionic strength 
of the solution passing down the 
column. These can be varied in a 
controlled way to achieve an effective 
separation.

Gel-ﬁltration columns separate 
proteins according to their size. The 
matrix consists of tiny porous beads. 
Protein molecules that are small 
enough to enter the holes in the beads 
are delayed and travel more slowly 
through the column. Proteins that 
cannot enter the beads are washed out 
of the column ﬁrst. Such columns also 
allow an estimate of protein size.

Afﬁnity columns contain a matrix 
covalently coupled to a molecule that 
interacts speciﬁcally with the protein 
of interest (e.g., an antibody, or an 
enzyme substrate). Proteins that bind 
speciﬁcally to such a column can 
subsequently be released by a pH 
change or by concentrated salt 
solutions, and they emerge highly 
puriﬁed (see also Figure 4–48).

When an electric ﬁeld is applied to a solution 
containing protein molecules, the molecules 
will migrate in a direction and at a speed that 
reﬂects their size and net charge. This forms 
the basis of the technique called 
electrophoresis.

ISOELECTRIC FOCUSING
For any protein there is a characteristic
pH, called the isoelectric point, at which
the protein has no net charge and 
therefore will not move in an electric 
ﬁeld. In isoelectric focusing, proteins
are electrophoresed in a narrow tube of
polyacrylamide gel in which a pH 
gradient is established by a mixture of
special buffers. Each protein moves to a
point in the pH gradient that corresponds
to its isoelectric point and stays there.

Individual polypeptide chains form a complex with

porous polyacrylamide gel. The apparatus used for 
this electrophoresis technique is shown above (left ). 
A reducing agent (mercaptoethanol) is usually added 
to break any –S–S– linkages within or between 
proteins. Under these conditions, unfolded polypeptide 
chains migrate at a rate that reﬂects their molecular 
weight.

TWO-DIMENSIONAL POLYACRYLAMIDE-GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
Complex mixtures of proteins cannot be resolved well on one-dimensional gels, but
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, combining two different separation methods, can
be used to resolve more than 1000 proteins in a two-dimensional protein map. In the 
ﬁrst step, native proteins are separated in a narrow gel on the basis of their intrinsic 
charge using isoelectric focusing (see left ). In the second step, this gel is placed on top of 
a gel slab, and the proteins are subjected to SDS-PAGE (see above ) in a direction 
perpendicular to that used in the ﬁrst step. Each protein migrates to form a discrete spot.

DNA and Chromosomes

Life  depends  on  the  ability  of  cells  to  store,  retrieve,  and  translate  the 
genetic  instructions  required  to  make  and  maintain  a  living  organism. 
This hereditary information is passed on from a cell to its daughter cells 
at cell division, and from generation to generation in multicellular organ-
isms through the reproductive cells—eggs and sperm. These instructions 
are stored within every living cell in its genes—the information-contain-
ing elements that determine the characteristics of a species as a whole 
and of the individuals within it.

At  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  when  genetics  emerged  as 
a science, scientists became intrigued by the chemical nature of genes. 
The information in genes is copied and transmitted from cell to daughter 
cells millions of times during the life of a multicellular organism, and it 
survives the process essentially unchanged. What kind of molecule could 
be capable of such accurate and almost unlimited replication, and also be 
able to direct the development of an organism and the daily life of a cell? 
What kind of instructions does the genetic information contain? How are 
these instructions physically organized so that the enormous amount of 
information required for the development and maintenance of even the 
simplest organism can be contained within the tiny space of a cell?

The answers to some of these questions began to emerge in the 1940s, 
when it was discovered from studies in simple fungi that genetic infor-
mation  consists  primarily  of  instructions  for  making  proteins.  Proteins 
perform  most  of  the  cell’s  functions:  they  serve  as  building  blocks  for 
cell structures; they form the enzymes that catalyze the cell’s chemical 
reactions;  they  regulate  the  activity  of  genes;  and  they  enable  cells  to 

172 

ChApter 5     DNa and chromosomes

move and to communicate with one another. With hindsight, it is hard 
to imagine what other type of instructions the genetic information could 
have contained. 

The other crucial advance made in the 1940s was the recognition that 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was the likely carrier of this genetic informa-
tion. But the mechanism whereby the hereditary information is copied for 
transmission from one generation of cells to the next, and how proteins 
are specified by the instructions in DNA, remained completely mysterious 
until 1953, when the structure of DNA was determined by James Watson 
and Francis Crick. The structure immediately revealed how DNA might be 
copied, or replicated, and it provided the first clues about how a molecule 
of DNA might encode the instructions for making proteins. Today, the fact 
that DNA is the genetic material is so fundamental to our understanding 
of life that it is difficult to appreciate what an enormous intellectual gap 
this discovery filled.

In this chapter, we begin by describing the structure of DNA. We see how, 
despite its chemical simplicity, the structure and chemical properties of 
DNA make it ideally suited for carrying genetic information. The genes of 
every cell on Earth are made of DNA, and insights into the relationship 
between DNA and genes have come from experiments in a wide variety 
of organisms. We then consider how genes and other important segments 
of DNA are arranged in the single, long DNA molecule that forms the core 
of each chromosome in the cell. Finally, we discuss how eukaryotic cells 
fold  these  long  DNA  molecules  into  compact  chromosomes  inside  the 
nucleus. This packing has to be done in an orderly fashion so that the 
chromosomes can be duplicated and apportioned correctly between the 
two daughter cells at each cell division. It must also allow the DNA to be 
accessed by the proteins that replicate and repair DNA, and regulate the 
activity of its many genes.

This is the first of five chapters that deal with basic genetic mechanisms—
the  ways  in  which  the  cell  maintains  and  makes  use  of  the  genetic 
information carried in its DNA. In Chapter 6, we discuss the mechanisms 
by which the cell accurately replicates and repairs its DNA. In Chapter 7, 
we consider gene expression—how genes are used to produce RNA and 
protein  molecules.  In  Chapter  8,  we  describe  how  a  cell  controls  gene 
expression to ensure that each of the many thousands of proteins encoded 
in its DNA is manufactured at the proper time and place. In Chapter 9, we 
discuss how present-day genes evolved from distant ancestors, and, in 
Chapter  10,  we  consider  some  of  the  experimental  techniques  used  to 
study both DNA and its role in fundamental cell processes.

An enormous amount has been learned about these subjects in the past 
60 years. Much less obvious, but equally important, is that our knowledge 
is very incomplete; thus a great deal still remains to be discovered about 
how DNA provides the instructions to build living things.

The STRUCTURe OF DNA
Well  before  biologists  understood  the  structure  of  DNA,  they  had  rec-
ognized  that  inherited  traits  and  the  genes  that  determine  them  were 
associated  with  the  chromosomes.  Chromosomes  (named  from  the 
Greek chroma, “color,” because of their staining properties) were discov-
ered in the nineteenth century as threadlike structures in the nucleus of 
eukaryotic cells that become visible as the cells begin to divide (figure 
5–1). As biochemical analysis became possible, researchers learned that 
chromosomes contain both DNA and protein. But which of these compo-
nents encoded the organism’s genetic information was not clear.

as distinct structures only when they 
condense in preparation for cell division, 
as shown on the left. the cell on the 
right, which is not dividing, contains the 
identical chromosomes, but they cannot be 
distinguished as individual entities because 
the DNa is in a much more extended 
conformation at this phase in the cell’s life 
cycle. (B) Schematic diagram of the outlines

We  now  know  that  the  DNA  carries  the  hereditary  information  of  the 
cell and that the protein components of chromosomes function largely to 
package and control the enormously long DNA molecules. But biologists 
in the 1940s had difficulty accepting DNA as the genetic material because 
of the apparent simplicity of its chemistry (see how We Know, pp. 174–
176). DNA, after all, is simply a long polymer composed of only four types 
of nucleotide subunits, which are chemically very similar to one another. 

Then, early in the 1950s, DNA was examined by X-ray diffraction analy-
sis, a technique for determining the three-dimensional atomic structure 
of  a  molecule  (see  Figure  4–52).  The  early  results  indicated  that  DNA 
is  composed  of  two  strands  wound  into  a  helix.  The  observation  that 
DNA  is  double-stranded  was  of  crucial  significance.  It  provided  one  of 
the  major  clues  that  led,  in  1953,  to  a  correct  model  for  the  structure 
of  DNA.  This  structure  immediately  suggested  how  DNA  could  encode 
the instructions necessary for life, and how these instructions could be 
copied and passed along when cells divide. In this section, we examine 
the structure of DNA and explain in general terms how it is able to store 
hereditary information. 

A DNA molecule Consists of Two Complementary Chains 
of Nucleotides
A molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) consists of two long poly-
nucleotide  chains.  Each  chain,  or  strand,  is  composed  of  four  types  of 
nucleotide subunits, and the two strands are held together by hydrogen 
bonds between the base portions of the nucleotides (figure 5–2).

hOW We KNOW
GeNeS Are MADe Of DNA

By  the  1920s,  scientists  generally  agreed  that  genes 
reside  on  chromosomes,  and  they  knew  that  chromo-
somes  are  composed  of  both  DNA  and  proteins.  But 
because  DNA  is  so  chemically  simple,  they  naturally 
assumed that genes had to be made of proteins, which 
are much more chemically diverse than DNA molecules. 
Even when the experimental evidence suggested other-
wise, this assumption proved hard to shake.

messages from the dead

The  case  for  DNA  began  to  emerge  in  the  late  1920s, 
when a British medical officer named Fred Griffith made 
an astonishing discovery. He was studying Streptococcus 
pneumoniae  (pneumococcus),  a  bacterium  that  causes 
pneumonia. As antibiotics had not yet been discovered, 
infection  with  this  organism  was  usually  fatal.  When

figure 5–3 Griffith showed that 
heat-killed, infectious bacteria can 
transform harmless, living bacteria 
into pathogenic ones. the bacterium 
Streptococcus pneumoniae comes in two 
forms that differ from one another in their 
microscopic appearance and in their ability 
to cause disease. cells of the pathogenic 
strain, which are lethal when injected into 
mice, are encased in a slimy, glistening 
polysaccharide capsule. When grown on 
a plate of nutrients in the laboratory, this 
disease-causing bacterium forms colonies 
that look dome-shaped and smooth; 
hence it is designated the S form. the 
harmless strain of the pneumococcus, 
on the other hand, lacks this protective 
coat; it forms colonies that appear flat 
and rough—hence, it is referred to as the 
r form. as illustrated, Griffith found that 
a substance present in the pathogenic 
S strain could permanently change, or 
transform, the nonlethal r strain into the 
deadly S strain.

grown  in  the  laboratory,  pneumococci  come  in  two 
forms: a pathogenic form that causes a lethal infection 
when injected into animals, and a harmless form that is 
easily  conquered  by  the  animal’s  immune  system  and 
does not produce an infection.

In the course of his investigations, Griffith injected vari-
ous preparations of these bacteria into mice. He showed 
that  pathogenic  pneumococci  that  had  been  killed  by 
heating  were  no  longer  able  to  cause  infection.  The 
surprise  came  when  Griffith  injected  both  heat-killed 
pathogenic bacteria and live harmless bacteria into the 
same mouse. This combination proved lethal: not only 
did the animals die of pneumonia, but Griffith found that 
their blood was teeming with live bacteria of the patho-
genic  form  (figure  5–3).  The  heat-killed  pneumococci 
had somehow converted the harmless bacteria into the 
lethal form. What’s more, Griffith found that the change 
was permanent: he could grow these “transformed” bac-
teria in culture, and they remained pathogenic. But what 
was this mysterious material that turned harmless bac-
teria into killers? And how was this change passed on to 
progeny bacteria?

Transformation
Griffith’s remarkable finding set the stage for the experi-
ments that would provide the first strong evidence that 
genes  are  made  of  DNA.  The  American  bacteriologist 
Oswald Avery, following up on Griffith’s work, discovered 
that the harmless pneumococcus could be transformed 
into  a  pathogenic  strain  in  a  culture  tube  by  exposing 
it to an extract prepared from the pathogenic strain. It 
would  take  another  15  years,  however,  for  Avery  and 
his  colleagues  Colin  MacLeod  and  Maclyn  McCarty  to 
successfully  purify  the  “transforming  principle”  from 
this soluble extract and to demonstrate that the active 
ingredient was DNA. Because the transforming principle 
caused a heritable change in the bacteria that received 
it, DNA must be the very stuff of which genes are made.

The  15-year  delay  was  in  part  a  reflection  of  the  aca-
demic  climate—and  the  widespread  supposition  that 
the  genetic  material  was  likely  to  be  made  of  protein. 
Because of the potential ramifications of their work, the 
researchers  wanted  to  be  absolutely  certain  that  the 
transforming principle was DNA before they announced 
their findings. As Avery noted in a letter to his brother, 
also  a  bacteriologist,  “It’s  lots  of  fun  to  blow  bubbles, 
but it’s wiser to prick them yourself before someone else 
tries  to.”  So  the  researchers  subjected  the  transform-
ing material to a battery of chemical tests (figure 5–4). 
They found that it exhibited all the chemical properties

CONCLUSION: The molecule that

figure 5–4 Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty demonstrated 
that DNA is the genetic material. the researchers prepared 
an extract from the disease-causing S strain of pneumococci 
and showed that the “transforming principle” that would 
permanently change the harmless r-strain pneumococci into the 
pathogenic S strain is DNa. this was the first evidence that DNa 
could serve as the genetic material.

characteristic  of  DNA;  furthermore,  they  showed  that 
enzymes  that  destroy  proteins  and  RNA  did  not  affect 
the  ability  of  the  extract  to  transform  bacteria,  while 
enzymes  that  destroy  DNA  inactivated  it.  And  like 
Griffith  before  them,  the  investigators  found  that  their 
purified preparation changed the bacteria permanently: 
DNA from the pathogenic species was taken up by the 
harmless species, and this change was faithfully passed 
on to subsequent generations of bacteria. 

This landmark study offered rigorous proof that purified 
DNA can act as genetic material. But the resulting paper, 
published  in  1944,  drew  remarkably  little  attention. 
Despite  the  meticulous  care  with  which  these  experi-
ments were performed, geneticists were not immediately 
convinced  that  DNA  is  the  hereditary  material.  Many 
argued that the transformation might have been caused 
by some trace protein contaminant in the preparations. 
Or that the extract might contain a mutagen that alters 
the genetic material of the harmless bacteria—convert-
ing them to the pathogenic form—rather than containing 
the genetic material itself.

ChApter 5     DNa and chromosomes

Virus cocktails
The debate was not settled definitively until 1952, when 
Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase fired up their labora-
tory  blender  and  demonstrated,  once  and  for  all,  that 
genes  are  made  of  DNA.  The  researchers  were  study-
ing T2—a virus that infects and eventually destroys the 
bacterium E. coli. These bacteria-killing viruses behave 
like  little  molecular  syringes:  they  inject  their  genetic 
material  into  the  bacterial  host  cell,  while  the  empty 
virus  heads  remain  attached  outside  (figure  5–5A). 
Once inside the bacterial cell, the viral genes direct the 
formation of new virus particles. In less than an hour, 
the  infected  cells  explode,  spewing  thousands  of  new 
viruses into the medium. These then infect neighboring 
bacteria, and the process begins again. 

The beauty of T2 is that these viruses contain only two 
kinds  of  molecules:  DNA  and  protein.  So  the  genetic 
material  had  to  be  one  or  the  other.  But  which?  The 
experiment  was  fairly  straightforward.  Because  the 
viral DNA enters the bacterial cell, while the rest of the 
virus particle remains outside, the researchers decided 
to  radioactively  label  the  protein  in  one  batch  of  virus 
and the DNA in another. Then, all they had to do was 
follow  the  radioactivity  to  see  whether  viral  DNA  or 

viral  protein  wound  up  inside  the  bacteria.  To  do  this, 
Hershey and Chase incubated their radiolabeled viruses 
with E. coli; after allowing a few minutes for infection to 
take place, they poured the mix into a Waring blender 
and hit “puree.” The blender’s spinning blades sheared 
the  empty  virus  heads  from  the  surfaces  of  the  bacte-
rial cells. The researchers then centrifuged the sample 
to separate the heavier, infected bacteria, which formed 
a  pellet  at  the  bottom  of  the  centrifuge  tube,  from  the 
empty viral coats, which remained in suspension (figure 
5–5B).
As  you  have  probably  guessed,  Hershey  and  Chase 
found  that  the  radioactive  DNA  entered  the  bacterial 
cells,  while  the  radioactive  proteins  remained  outside 
with the empty virus heads. They found that the radioac-
tive DNA was also incorporated into the next generation 
of virus particles. 
This  experiment  demonstrated  conclusively  that  viral 
DNA  enters  bacterial  host  cells,  whereas  viral  protein 
does  not.  Thus,  the  genetic  material  in  this  virus  had 
to be made of DNA. Together with the studies done by 
Avery,  MacLeod,  and  McCarty,  this  evidence  clinched 
the case for DNA as the agent of heredity.

figure 5–5 hershey and Chase showed definitively that genes are made of DNA. (a) the researchers worked with t2 viruses, which 
are made entirely of protein and DNa. each virus acts as a molecular syringe, injecting its genetic material into a bacterium; the empty 
viral capsule remains attached to the outside of the cell. (B) to determine whether the genetic material of the virus is protein or DNa, 
the researchers radioactively labeled the DNa in one batch of viruses with 32p and the proteins in a second batch of viruses with 35S. 
Because DNa lacks sulfur and the proteins lack phosphorus, these radioactive isotopes provided a handy way for the researchers to 
distinguish these two types of molecules. these labeled viruses were allowed to infect and replicate inside E. coli, and the mixture was 
then disrupted by brief pulsing in a Waring blender and separated to part the infected bacteria from the empty viral heads. When the 
researchers measured the radioactivity, they found that much of the 32p-labeled DNa had entered the bacterial cells, while the vast 
majority of the 35S-labeled proteins remained in solution with the spent viral particles.

ECB4 e5.05/5.05

As  we  saw  in  Chapter  2  (Panel  2–6,  pp.  76–77),  nucleotides  are  com-
posed of a nitrogen-containing base and a five-carbon sugar, to which 
is attached  one or more phosphate groups. For the nucleotides in DNA, 
the sugar is deoxyribose (hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid), and the 
base can be either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). The 
nucleotides are covalently linked together in a chain through the sugars 
and phosphates, which thus form a backbone of alternating sugar–phos-
phate–sugar–phosphate (see Figure 5–2B). Because it is only the base that 
differs in each of the four types of subunits, each polynucleotide chain 
in DNA can be thought of as a necklace: a sugar–phosphate backbone 
strung  with  four  types  of  beads  (the  four  bases  A,  C,  G,  and  T).  These 
same  symbols  (A,  C,  G,  and  T)  are  also  commonly  used  to  denote  the 
four  different  nucleotides—that  is,  the  bases  with  their  attached  sugar 
phosphates.

The  way  in  which  the  nucleotide  subunits  are  linked  together  gives  a 
DNA strand a chemical polarity. If we imagine that each nucleotide has a 
knob (the phosphate) and a hole (see Figure 5–2A), each strand, formed 
by  interlocking  knobs  with  holes,  will  have  all  of  its  subunits  lined  up 
in  the  same  orientation.  Moreover,  the  two  ends  of  the  strand  can  be 
easily  distinguished,  as  one  will  have  a  hole  (the  3’  hydroxyl)  and  the 
other a knob (the 5’ phosphate). This polarity in a DNA strand is indicated 
by referring to one end as the 3’ end and the other as the 5’ end. This 
convention is based on the details of the chemical linkage between the 
nucleotide subunits.

The two polynucleotide chains in the DNA double helix are held together 
by hydrogen-bonding between the bases on the different strands. All the 
bases are therefore on the inside of the double helix, with the sugar–phos-
phate backbones on the outside (see Figure 5–2D). The bases do not pair 
at random, however: A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C  
(figure 5–6). In each case, a bulkier two-ring base (a purine, see Panel 2–6, 
pp. 76–77) is paired with a single-ring base (a pyrimidine). Each purine–
pyrimidine pair is called a base pair, and this complementary base-pairing 
enables the base pairs to be packed in the energetically most favorable

that is, its two ends are chemically different.

ChApter 5     DNa and chromosomes

figure 5–7 A space-filling model shows the conformation of the 
DNA double helix. the two DNa strands wind around each other to 
form a right-handed helix (see Figure 4–14) with 10 bases per turn. 
Shown here are 1.5 turns of the DNa double helix. the coiling of the 
two strands around each other creates two grooves in the double 
helix. the wider groove is called the major groove and the smaller  
one the minor groove. the colors of the atoms are: N, blue; O, red; 
p, yellow; and h, white.

arrangement in the interior of the double helix. In this arrangement, each 
base pair has a similar width, thus holding the sugar–phosphate back-
bones an equal distance apart along the DNA molecule. The members 
of  each  base  pair  can  fit  together  within  the  double  helix  because  the 
two strands of the helix run antiparallel to each other—that is, they are 
oriented with opposite polarities (see Figure 5–2C and D). The antiparallel 
sugar–phosphate strands then twist around each other to form a double 
helix containing 10 base pairs per helical turn (figure 5–7). This twisting 
also contributes to the energetically favorable conformation of the DNA 
double helix.

A consequence of the base-pairing requirements is that each strand of 
a  DNA  double  helix  contains  a  sequence  of  nucleotides  that  is  exactly 
complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand—an A 
always matches a T on the opposite strand, and a C always matches a 
G. This complementarity is of crucial importance when it comes to both 
copying and repairing the DNA, as we discuss in Chapter 6. An animated 
version of the DNA structure can be seen in Movie 5.1.

The Structure of DNA Provides a mechanism for heredity
The need for genes to encode information that must be copied and trans-
mitted accurately when a cell divides raised two fundamental questions: 
how can the information for specifying an organism be carried in chemical 
form,  and  how  can  the  information  be  accurately  copied?  The  discov-
ery of the structure of the DNA double helix was a landmark in biology 
because it immediately suggested the answers—and thereby resolved the 
problem of heredity at the molecular level. In this chapter, we outline the 
answer to the first question; in the next chapter, we address in detail the 
answer to the second.

Information is encoded in the order, or sequence, of the nucleotides along 
each DNA strand. Each base—A, C, T, or G—can be considered a letter in 
a four-letter alphabet that is used to spell out biological messages (figure 
5–8). Organisms differ from one another because their respective DNA 
molecules  have  different  nucleotide  sequences  and,  consequently,  carry 
different biological messages. But how is the nucleotide alphabet used to 
make up messages, and what do they spell out?

It had already been established some time before the structure of DNA 
was determined that genes contain the instructions for producing pro-
teins.  DNA  messages,  therefore,  must  somehow  be  able  to  encode 
proteins. Consideration of the chemical character of proteins makes the 
problem easier to define. As discussed in Chapter 4, the function of a pro-
tein is determined by its three-dimensional structure, and this structure in 
turn is determined by the sequence of the amino acids in its polypeptide 
chain.  The  linear  sequence  of  nucleotides  in  a  gene  must  therefore  be 
able to spell out the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein. 

The  exact  correspondence  between  the  4-letter  nucleotide  alphabet  of 
DNA  and  the  20-letter  amino  acid  alphabet  of  proteins—the  genetic 
code—is not obvious from the structure of the DNA molecule, and it took 
more  than  a  decade  after  the  discovery  of  the  double  helix  to  work  it

out. In Chapter 7, we describe this code in detail when we discuss gene 
expression—the process by which the nucleotide sequence of a gene is 
transcribed into the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule, which, in 
most cases, is then translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein 
(figure 5–9).

The  amount  of  information  in  an  organism’s  DNA  is  staggering:  writ-
ten out in the four-letter nucleotide alphabet, the nucleotide sequence of 
a very small protein-coding gene from humans occupies a quarter of a 
page of text, while the complete human DNA sequence would fill more 
than 1000 books the size of this one. Herein lies a problem that affects the 
architecture of all eukaryotic chromosomes: how can all this information 
be packed neatly into every cell nucleus? In the remainder of this chapter, 
we discuss the answer to this question.

The STRUCTURe OF eUkARyOTiC 
ChROmOSOmeS 
Large amounts of DNA are required to encode all the information needed 
to make even a single-celled bacterium, and far more DNA is needed to 
encode the information to make a multicellular organism like you. Each 
human cell contains about 2 meters (m) of DNA; yet the cell nucleus is 
only 5–8 μm in diameter. Tucking all this material into such a small space 
is the equivalent of trying to fold 40 km (24 miles) of extremely fine thread 
into a tennis ball. 

In eukaryotic cells, very long double-stranded DNA molecules are pack-
aged into chromosomes. These DNA molecules not only fit readily inside 
the nucleus, but, after they are replicated, they can be easily apportioned 
between the two daughter cells at each cell division. The complex task of 
packaging DNA is accomplished by specialized proteins that bind to and 
fold the DNA, generating a series of coils and loops that provide increas-
ingly higher levels of organization and prevent the DNA from becoming 
a tangled, unmanageable mess. Amazingly, the DNA is compacted in a 
way that allows it to remain accessible to all of the enzymes and other 
proteins that replicate it, repair it, and control the expression of its genes.

Bacteria typically carry their genes on a single, circular DNA molecule. 
This molecule is also associated with proteins that condense the DNA, 
but  these  proteins  differ  from  the  ones  that  package  eukaryotic  DNA. 
Although  this  prokaryotic  DNA  is  called  a  bacterial  “chromosome,”  it 
does not have the same structure as eukaryotic chromosomes, and less is 
known about how it is packaged. Our discussion of chromosome structure 
in this chapter will therefore focus entirely on eukaryotic chromosomes.

eukaryotic DNA is Packaged into multiple Chromosomes
In eukaryotes, such as ourselves, the DNA in the nucleus is distributed 
among a set of different chromosomes. The DNA in a human nucleus, 
for example, contains approximately 3.2 × 109 nucleotides parceled out 
into 23 or 24 different types of chromosome (males, with their Y chromo-
some, have an extra type of chromosome that females do not have). Each 
chromosome consists of a single, enormously long, linear DNA molecule 
associated with proteins that fold and pack the fine thread of DNA into 
a  more  compact  structure.  The  complex  of  DNA  and  protein  is  called 
chromatin.  In  addition  to  the  proteins  involved  in  packaging  the  DNA,

ChApter 5     DNa and chromosomes

figure 5–10 each human chromosome 
can be “painted” a different color to 
allow its unambiguous identification. the 
chromosomes shown here were isolated 
from a cell undergoing nuclear division 
(mitosis) and are therefore in a highly 
compact (condensed) state. chromosome 
painting is carried out by exposing the 
chromosomes to a collection of human 
DNa molecules that have been coupled 
to a combination of fluorescent dyes. For 
example, DNa molecules derived from 
chromosome 1 are labeled with one specific 
dye combination, those from chromosome 
2 with another, and so on. Because the 
labeled DNa can form base pairs (hybridize) 
only to its chromosome of origin (discussed 
in chapter 10), each chromosome is 
differently colored. For such experiments, 
the chromosomes are treated so that the 
individual strands of the double-helical DNa 
molecules partly separate to enable base-
pairing with the labeled, single-stranded 
DNa, while keeping the chromosome 
structure relatively intact. (a) Micrograph 
shows the array of chromosomes as they 
originally spilled from the lysed cell. 
(B) the same chromosomes have been 
artificially lined up in order. In this so-called 
karyotype, the homologous chromosomes 
are numbered and arranged in pairs; the 
presence of a Y chromosome reveals that 
these chromosomes came from a male.

With the exception of the germ cells (sperm and eggs) and highly spe-
cialized  cells  that  lack  DNA  entirely  (such  as  mature  red  blood  cells), 
human cells each contain two copies of each chromosome, one inherited 
from  the  mother  and  one  from  the  father.  The  maternal  and  paternal 
chromosomes of a pair are called homologous chromosomes (homologs). 
The only nonhomologous chromosome pairs are the sex chromosomes 
in  males,  where  a  Y  chromosome  is  inherited  from  the  father  and  an 
X  chromosome  from  the  mother.  (Females  inherit  one  X  chromosome 
from each parent and have no Y chromosome.)

In  addition  to  being  different  sizes,  the  different  human  chromosomes 
can be distinguished from one another by a variety of techniques. Each 
chromosome  can  be  “painted”  a  different  color  using  sets  of  chromo-
some-specific  DNA  molecules  coupled  to  different  fluorescent  dyes 
(figure 5–10). This involves a technique called DNA hybridization, which 
takes advantage of complementary base-pairing, as we will describe in 
detail in Chapter 10. A more traditional way of distinguishing one chro-
mosome from another is to stain the chromosomes with dyes that bind to 
certain types of DNA sequences. These dyes mainly distinguish between 
DNA that is rich in A-T nucleotide pairs and DNA that is G-C rich, and 
they produce a predictable pattern of bands along each type of chromo-
some. The patterns that result allow each chromosome to be identified 
and numbered. 

An  ordered  display  of  the  full  set  of  46  human  chromosomes  is  called 
the human karyotype  (see Figure 5–10). If parts of a chromosome are 
lost, or switched between chromosomes, these changes can be detected. 
Cytogeneticists analyze karyotypes to detect chromosomal abnormalities 
that are associated with some inherited defects (figure 5–11) and with 
certain types of cancer.

Chromosomes Contain long Strings of genes
The most important function of chromosomes is to carry the genes—the 
functional units of heredity (figure 5–12). A gene is often defined as a 

figure 5–11 Abnormal chromosomes are associated with some 
inherited genetic defects. (a) a pair of chromosomes 12 from 
a patient with inherited ataxia, a genetic disease of the brain 
characterized by progressive deterioration of motor skills. the 
patient has one normal chromosome 12 (left) and one abnormally 
long chromosome 12, which contains a piece of chromosome 4 as 
identified by its banding pattern. (B) this interpretation was confirmed 
by chromosome painting, in which chromosome 12 was painted blue 
and chromosome 4 was painted red. (From e. Schröck et al., Science 
273:494–497, 1996. With permission from the aaaS.)

million nucleotide pairs and 6600 genes—spread across 16 chromosomes. Note that, in each gene, only one of 
the two DNa strands actually encodes the information to make an rNa molecule, and this can be either strand, as 
indicated by the light red bars. however, a gene is generally denoted to contain both the “coding strand” and its

segment  of  DNA  that  contains  the  instructions  for  making  a  particular 
protein or RNA molecule. Most of the RNA molecules encoded by genes 
are  subsequently  used  to  produce  a  protein  (see  Figure  5–9).  In  some 
cases,  however,  the  RNA  molecule  is  the  final  product;  like  proteins, 
these RNA molecules have diverse functions in the cell, including struc-
tural, catalytic, and gene regulatory roles, as we discuss in later chapters.

ECB4 e5.13/5.12

Together,  the  total  genetic  information  carried  by  all  the  chromo-
somes in a cell or organism constitutes its genome. Complete genome 
sequences  have  been  determined  for  thousands  of  organisms,  from  
E. coli to humans. As might be expected, some correlation exists between 
the complexity of an organism and the number of genes in its genome. 
For example, the total number of genes ranges from less than 500 for a 
simple  bacterium  to  about  30,000  for  humans.  Bacteria  and  some  sin-
gle-celled  eukaryotes,  including  S.  cerevisiae,  have  especially  compact 
genomes: the DNA molecules that make up their chromosomes are little 
more than strings of closely packed genes (see Figure 5–12). However, 
chromosomes  from  many  eukaryotes—including  humans—contain,  in 
addition to genes and the specific nucleotide sequences required for nor-
mal gene expression, a large excess of interspersed DNA. This extra DNA 
is sometimes called “junk DNA,” because the usefulness to the cell has 
not yet been demonstrated. Although the particular nucleotide sequence 
of most of this DNA might not be important, the DNA itself—acting as 
spacer material—may be crucial for the long-term evolution of the spe-
cies and for the proper activity of the genes. In addition, comparisons of 
the genome sequences from many different species reveal that a portion 
of this extra DNA is highly conserved among related species, indicating 
that it serves an important function—although we don’t yet know what 
that is.

In  general,  the  more  complex  an  organism,  the  larger  is  its  genome. 
But this relationship does not always hold true. The human genome, for 
example, is 200 times larger than that of the yeast S. cerevisiae, but 30 
times smaller than that of some plants and at least 60 times smaller than 
some species of amoeba (see Figure 1–40). Furthermore, how the DNA is 
apportioned over chromosomes also differs from one species to another. 
Humans have a total of 46 chromosomes (including both maternal and 
paternal sets), but a species of small deer has only 7, while some carp 
species  have  more  than  100.  Even  closely  related  species  with  similar 
genome  sizes  can  have  very  different  numbers  and  sizes  of  chromo-
somes (figure 5–13). Thus, although gene number is roughly correlated 
with  species  complexity,  there  is  no  simple  relationship  between  gene 
number, chromosome number, and total genome size. The genomes and 
chromosomes of modern species have each been shaped by a unique his-
tory of seemingly random genetic events, acted on by specific selection 
pressures, as we discuss in Chapter 9.

Specialized DNA Sequences Are Required for DNA 
Replication and Chromosome Segregation
To form a functional chromosome, a DNA molecule must do more than 
simply carry genes: it must be able to be replicated, and the replicated 
copies  must  be  separated  and  partitioned  equally  and  reliably  into  the 
two daughter cells at each cell division. These processes occur through 
an  ordered  series  of  events,  known  collectively  as  the  cell  cycle.  This 
cycle of cell growth and division is briefly summarized in figure 5–14 and 
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 18. Only two broad stages of the cell 
cycle  need  concern  us  in  this  chapter:  interphase,  when  chromosomes 
are duplicated, and mitosis, when they are distributed, or segregated, to 
the two daughter nuclei. 

ECB4 e5.14/5.13

During  interphase,  the  chromosomes  are  extended  as  long,  thin,  tan-
gled threads of DNA in the nucleus and cannot be easily distinguished 
in  the  light  microscope  (see  Figure  5–1).  We  refer  to  chromosomes  in 
this extended state as interphase chromosomes. As we discuss in Chapter 
6, specialized DNA sequences found in all eukaryotes ensure that DNA 
replication  occurs  efficiently  during  interphase.  One  type  of  nucleotide 
sequence  acts  as  a  replication  origin,  where  replication  of  the  DNA 
begins;  eukaryotic  chromosomes  contain  many  replication  origins  to 
ensure that the long DNA molecules are replicated rapidly (figure 5–15). 
Another DNA sequence forms the telomeres at each of the two ends of a 
chromosome. Telomeres contain repeated nucleotide sequences that are 
required for the ends of chromosomes to be replicated. They also cap the 
ends of the DNA molecule, preventing them from being mistaken by the 
cell as broken DNA in need of repair.

figure 5–14 the duplication and segregation of chromosomes occurs through an ordered cell cycle in proliferating cells. During 
interphase, the cell expresses many of its genes, and—during part of this phase—it duplicates chromosomes. Once chromosome 
duplication is complete, the cell can enter M phase, during which nuclear division, or mitosis, occurs. In mitosis, the duplicated 
chromosomes condense, gene expression largely ceases, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle forms from 
microtubules and other proteins. the condensed chromosomes are then captured by the mitotic spindle, one complete set is pulled 
to each end of the cell, and a nuclear envelope forms around each chromosome set. In the final step of M phase, the cell divides to 
produce two daughter cells. Only two different chromosomes are shown here for simplicity.

figure 5–15 three DNA sequence 
elements are needed to produce a 
eucaryotic chromosome that can be 
replicated and then segregated at 
mitosis. each chromosome has multiple 
origins of replication, one centromere, and 
two telomeres. the sequence of events 
that a typical chromosome follows during 
the cell cycle is shown schematically. the 
DNa replicates in interphase, beginning at 
the origins of replication and proceeding 
bidirectionally from the origins across the 
chromosome. In M phase, the centromere 
attaches the duplicated chromosomes 
to the mitotic spindle so that one copy is 
distributed to each daughter cell when 
the cell divides. prior to cell division, the 
centromere also helps to hold the compact, 
duplicated chromosomes together 
until they are ready to be pulled apart. 
telomeres, which form special caps at 
the tips of each chromosome, aid in the 
replication of chromosome ends.

ECB4 e5.16/5.15

Eukaryotic  chromosomes  also  contain  a  third  type  of  specialized  DNA 
sequence, called the centromere, that allows duplicated chromosomes 
to be separated during M phase (see Figure 5–15). During this stage of 
the  cell  cycle,  the  DNA  coils  up,  adopting  a  more  and  more  compact 
structure,  ultimately  forming  highly  compacted,  or  condensed,  mitotic 
chromosomes. This is the state in which the duplicated chromosomes can 
be  most  easily  visualized  (figure  5–16  and  see  Figures  5–1  and  5–14). 
Once  the  chromosomes  have  condensed,  the  centromere  attaches  the 
mitotic spindle to each duplicated chromosome in a way that allows one 
copy of each chromosome to be segregated to each daughter cell (see 
Figure 5–15B). We describe the central role that centromeres play in cell 
division in Chapter 18.

extensively entangled with one another (figure 5–17). In addition, some 
chromosomes are attached to particular sites on the nuclear envelope—
the pair of concentric membranes that surround the nucleus—or to the 
underlying nuclear lamina, the protein meshwork that supports the enve-
lope (discussed in Chapter 17).

ECB4 e5.18/5.17

The  most  obvious  example  of  chromosome  organization  in  the  inter-
phase  nucleus  is  the  nucleolus  (figure  5–18).  The  nucleolus  is  where 
the parts of the different chromosomes carrying genes that encode ribos-
omal RNAs cluster together. Here, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized and 
combine with proteins to form ribosomes, the cell’s protein-synthesizing 
machines. As we discuss in Chapter 7, ribosomal RNAs play both struc-
tural and catalytic roles in the ribosome.

The DNA in Chromosomes is Always highly Condensed
As  we  have  seen,  all  eukaryotic  cells,  whether  in  interphase  or  mito-
sis, package their DNA tightly into chromosomes. Human Chromosome 
22,  for  example,  contains  about  48  million  nucleotide  pairs;  stretched 
out end-to-end, its DNA would extend about 1.5 cm. Yet, during mito-
sis, Chromosome 22 measures only about 2 μm in length—that is, nearly 
10,000 times more compact than the DNA would be if it were stretched 
to  its  full  length.  This  remarkable  feat  of  compression  is  performed  by 
proteins that coil and fold the DNA into higher and higher levels of organ-
ization. The DNA of interphase chromosomes, although about 20 times 
less condensed than that of mitotic chromosomes (figure 5–19), is still 
packed tightly.

figure 5–18 the nucleolus is the most 
prominent structure in the interphase 
nucleus. electron micrograph of a thin 
section through the nucleus of a human 
fibroblast. the nucleus is surrounded by the 
nuclear envelope. Inside the nucleus, the 
chromatin appears as a diffuse speckled 
mass, with regions that are especially dense, 
called heterochromatin (dark staining). 
heterochromatin contains few genes and 
is located mainly around the periphery of 
the nucleus, immediately under the nuclear 
envelope. the large dark region is the 
nucleolus, which contains the genes for 
ribosomal rNas; these genes are located 
on multiple chromosomes but are clustered 
together in the nucleolus. (courtesy of

In the next sections, we introduce the specialized proteins that make this 
compression possible. Bear in mind, though, that chromosome structure 
is dynamic. Not only do chromosomes condense and decondense dur-
ing the cell cycle, but chromosome packaging must be flexible enough 
to allow rapid, on-demand access to different regions of the interphase 
chromosome,  unpacking  enough  to  allow  protein  complexes  access 
to  specific,  localized  DNA  sequences  for  replication,  repair,  or  gene 
expression. 

Nucleosomes Are the Basic Units of eukaryotic 
Chromosome Structure
The proteins that bind to DNA to form eukaryotic chromosomes are tradi-
tionally divided into two general classes: the histones and the nonhistone 
chromosomal proteins. Histones are present in enormous quantities (more 
than 60 million molecules of several different types in each cell), and their 
total mass in chromosomes is about equal to that of the DNA itself. The 
complex of both classes of protein with nuclear DNA is called chromatin. 

Histones are responsible for the first and most fundamental level of chro-
matin packing, the nucleosome, which was discovered in 1974. When 
interphase nuclei are broken open very gently and their contents exam-
ined with an electron microscope, much of the chromatin is in the form 
of chromatin fibers with a diameter of about 30 nm (figure 5–20A). If this 
chromatin is subjected to treatments that cause it to unfold partially, it 
can then be seen in the electron microscope as a series of “beads on a 
string” (figure 5–20B). The string is DNA, and each bead is a nucleosome 
core  particle,  which  consists  of  DNA  wound  around  a  core  of  proteins 
formed from histones.

The structure of the nucleosome core particle was determined after first 
isolating nucleosomes by treating chromatin in its unfolded, “beads on a 
string” form with enzymes called nucleases, which break down DNA by 
cutting  the  phosphodiester  bonds  between  nucleotides.  After  digestion 
for a short period, only the exposed DNA between the core particles—
the linker DNA—is degraded, allowing the core particles to be isolated. 
An  individual  nucleosome  core  particle  consists  of  a  complex  of  eight 
histone  proteins—two  molecules  each  of  histones  H2A,  H2B,  H3,  and 
H4—and  a  stretch  of  double-stranded  DNA,  147  nucleotide  pairs  long, 
that winds around this histone octamer (figure 5–21). The high-resolution 
structure of the nucleosome core particle was solved in 1997, revealing 
in atomic detail the disc-shaped histone octamer around which the DNA 
is tightly wrapped, making 1.7 turns in a left-handed coil (figure 5–22).

figure 5–21 Nucleosomes contain DNA wrapped around a protein 
core of eight histone molecules. In a test tube, the nucleosome core 
particle can be released from chromatin by digestion of the linker DNa 
with a nuclease, which degrades the exposed DNa but not the DNa 
wound tightly around the nucleosome core. the DNa around each 
isolated nucleosome core particle can then be released and its length 
determined. With 147 nucleotide pairs in each fragment, the DNa 
wraps almost twice around each histone octamer.

The  linker  DNA  between  each  nucleosome  core  particle  can  vary  in 
length from a few nucleotide pairs up to about 80. (The term nucleosome 
technically refers to a nucleosome core particle plus one of its adjacent 
DNA linkers, as shown in Figure 5–21, but it is often used to refer to the 
nucleosome core particle itself.) The formation of nucleosomes converts 
a DNA molecule into a chromatin thread that is approximately one-third 
the length of the initial piece of DNA, and it provides the first level of DNA 
packing.

All  four  of  the  histones  that  make  up  the  octamer  are  relatively  small 
proteins, with a high proportion of positively charged amino acids (lysine 
and arginine). The positive charges help the histones bind tightly to the 
negatively  charged  sugar–phosphate  backbone  of  DNA.  These  numer-
ous  electrostatic  interactions  explain  in  part  why  DNA  of  virtually  any 
sequence  can  bind  to  a  histone  octamer.  Each  of  the  histones  in  the

octamer also has a long, unstructured N-terminal amino acid “tail” that 
extends out from the nucleosome core particle (see Figure 5–22). These 
histone tails are subject to several types of reversible, covalent chemical 
modifications that control many aspects of chromatin structure.

The histones that form the nucleosome core are among the most highly 
conserved  of  all  known  eukaryotic  proteins:  there  are  only  two  differ-
ences between the amino acid sequences of histone H4 from peas and 
cows, for example. This extreme evolutionary conservation reflects the 
vital role of histones in controlling eukaryotic chromosome structure. 

Chromosome Packing Occurs on multiple levels
Although long strings of nucleosomes form on most chromosomal DNA, 
chromatin in the living cell rarely adopts the extended beads-on-a-string 
form seen in Figure 5–20B. Instead, the nucleosomes are further packed 
on top of one another to generate a more compact structure, such as the 
chromatin  fiber  shown  in  Figure  5–20A  and  Movie  5.2.  This  additional 
packing  of  nucleosomes  into  a  chromatin  fiber  depends  on  a  fifth  his-
tone called histone H1, which is thought to pull adjacent nucleosomes 
together into a regular repeating array. This “linker” histone changes the 
path the DNA takes as it exits the nucleosome core, allowing it to form a 
more condensed chromatin fiber (figure 5–23).

We  saw  earlier  that  during  mitosis  chromatin  becomes  so  highly  con-
densed that individual chromosomes can be seen in the light microscope. 
How is a chromatin fiber folded to produce mitotic chromosomes? The 
answer is not yet known in detail, but it is known that the chromatin fiber 
is folded into a series of loops, and that these loops are further condensed 
to  produce  the  interphase  chromosome;  finally,  this  compact  string  of 
loops is thought to undergo at least one more level of packing to form the 
mitotic chromosome (figure 5–24 and figure 5–25).

important for the formation of the chromatin 
fiber. the long c-terminal tail is required for 
h1 to bind to chromatin. the positions of 
the c-terminal and N-terminal tails in the

(Volume of a cylinder is πr2h; volume 
of a sphere is 4/3 πr3.) What fraction 
of the total volume of the nucleus 
do the histone octamers occupy? 
how does this compare with the 
volume of the nucleus occupied by 
human DNA?

histone proteins are among the 
most highly conserved proteins in 
eukaryotes. histone h4 proteins 
from a pea and a cow, for example, 
differ in only 2 of 102 amino acids. 
Comparison of the gene sequences 
shows many more differences, but 
only two change the amino acid 
sequence. These observations 
indicate that mutations that change 
amino acids must have been 
selected against during evolution. 
Why do you suppose that amino-
acid-altering mutations in histone 
genes are deleterious?

is packed especially tightly. this scanning electron micrograph 
shows a region near one end of a typical mitotic chromosome. each 
knoblike projection is believed to represent the tip of a separate loop 
of chromatin. the chromosome has duplicated, forming two sister 
chromatids that are still held close together (see Figure 5–16). the 
ends of the two chromatids can be distinguished on the right of the 
photo. (From M.p. Marsden and U.K. Laemmli, Cell 17:849–858, 1989.

The RegUlATiON OF ChROmOSOme 
STRUCTURe
So far, we have discussed how DNA is packed tightly into chromatin. We 
now turn to the question of how this packaging can be regulated to allow 
rapid access to the underlying DNA. The DNA in cells carries enormous 
amounts of coded information, and cells must be able to get to this infor-
mation as needed. 

In this section, we discuss how a cell can alter its chromatin structure 
to expose localized regions of DNA and allow access to specific proteins 
and  protein  complexes,  particularly  those  involved  in  gene  expression 
and in DNA replication and repair. We then discuss how chromatin struc-
ture  is  established  and  maintained—and  how  a  cell  can  pass  on  some 
forms of this structure to its descendants. The regulation and inheritance 
of chromatin structure play crucial parts in the development of eukaryo-
tic organisms.

Changes in Nucleosome Structure Allow Access to DNA 
Eukaryotic cells have several ways to adjust the local structure of their 
chromatin rapidly. One way takes advantage of chromatin-remodeling 
complexes, protein machines that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to 
change  the  position  of  the  DNA  wrapped  around  nucleosomes  (figure 
5–26A). The complexes, which attach to both the histone octamer and 
the DNA wrapped around it, can locally alter the arrangement of nucle-
osomes  on  the  DNA,  making  the  DNA  either  more  accessible  (figure 
5–26B)  or  less  accessible  to  other  proteins  in  the  cell.  During  mitosis, 
many  of  the  chromatin-remodeling  complexes  are  inactivated,  which 
may help mitotic chromosomes maintain their tightly packed structure.

Another  way  of  altering  chromatin  structure  relies  on  the  reversible 
chemical  modification  of  the  histones.  The  tails  of  all  four  of  the  core 
histones are particularly subject to these covalent modifications (figure 
5–27A). For example, acetyl, phosphate, or methyl groups can be added 
to  and  removed  from  the  tails  by  enzymes  that  reside  in  the  nucleus 
(figure 5–27B). These and other modifications can have important con-
sequences for the stability of the chromatin fiber. Acetylation of lysines, 
for instance, can reduce the affinity of the tails for adjacent nucleosomes, 
thereby loosening chromatin structure and allowing access to particular 
nuclear proteins.

Most  importantly,  however,  these  modifications  can  serve  as  docking 
sites  on  the  histone  tails  for  a  variety  of  regulatory  proteins.  Different 
patterns of modifications attract different proteins to particular stretches 
of chromatin. Some of these proteins promote chromatin condensation, 
whereas others decondense chromatin and facilitate access to the DNA. 
Specific combinations of tail modifications and the proteins that bind to 
them have different meanings for the cell: one pattern, for example, indi-
cates  that  a  particular  stretch  of  chromatin  has  been  newly  replicated;

complexes locally reposition the DNA 
wrapped around nucleosomes. (a) the 
complexes use energy derived from atp 
hydrolysis to loosen the nucleosomal DNa 
and push it along the histone octamer, 
thereby exposing the DNa to other DNa-
binding proteins. the blue stripes have 
been added to show how the nucleosome 
moves along the DNa. Many cycles of 
atp hydrolysis are required to produce 
such a shift. (B) In the case shown, the 
repositioning of nucleosomes decondenses 
the chromatin in a particular chromosomal 
region; in other cases, it condenses the 
chromatin.

another indicates that the genes in that stretch of chromatin should be

Like  the  chromatin-remodeling  complexes,  the  enzymes  that  modify 
histone  tails  are  tightly  regulated.  They  are  brought  to  particular  chro-
matin regions mainly by interactions with proteins that bind to specific

(a) Schematic drawing showing the positions of the histone tails that extend from each nucleosome. (B) each histone can be modified 
by the covalent attachment of a number of different chemical groups, mainly to the tails. histone h3, for example, can receive an acetyl

chain, with each amino acid designated by its one-letter code. Note that some positions, such as lysines (K) 9, 14, 23, and 27, can be 
modified in more than one way. Moreover, lysines can be modified with either one, two, or three methyl groups (not shown). Note that 
histone h3 contains 135 amino acids, most of which are in its globular portion (green), and that most modifications are on its N-terminal 
tail (orange). (c) Different combinations of histone tail modifications can confer a specific meaning on the stretch of chromatin on which 
they occur, as indicated. Only a few of these “meanings” are known.

sequences in DNA (we discuss these proteins in Chapter 8). The histone-
modifying  enzymes  work  in  concert  with  the  chromatin-remodeling 
complexes to condense or decondense stretches of chromatin, allowing 
local chromatin structure to change rapidly according to the needs of the 
cell.

interphase Chromosomes Contain Both Condensed and 
more extended Forms of Chromatin
The localized alteration of chromatin packing by remodeling complexes 
and histone modification has important effects on the large-scale struc-
ture of interphase chromosomes. Interphase chromatin is not uniformly 
packed. Instead, regions of the chromosome that contain genes that are 
being expressed are generally more extended, while those that contain 
silent genes are more condensed. Thus, the detailed structure of an inter-
phase chromosome can differ from one cell type to the next, helping to 
determine which genes are expressed. Most cell types express about 20 
to 30 % of the genes they contain. 

The most highly condensed form of interphase chromatin is called hete-
rochromatin (from the Greek heteros, “different,” plus chromatin). It was 
first observed in the light microscope in the 1930s as discrete, strongly 
staining regions within the mass of chromatin. Heterochromatin typically 
makes up about 10% of an interphase chromosome, and in mammalian 
chromosomes, it is concentrated around the centromere region and in 
the telomeres at the ends of the chromosomes (see Figure 5–15). 

The  rest  of  the  interphase  chromatin  is  called  euchromatin  (from  the 
Greek eu, “true” or “normal,” plus chromatin). Although we use the term 
euchromatin  to  refer  to  chromatin  that  exists  in  a  more  decondensed 
state  than heterochromatin, it  is  now  clear that  both  euchromatin  and 
heterochromatin are composed of mixtures of different chromatin struc-
tures (figure 5–28). 

Each  type  of  chromatin  structure  is  established  and  maintained  by 
different sets of histone tail modifications that attract distinct sets of non-
histone proteins. The modifications that direct the formation of the most 
common type of heterochromatin, for example, include the methylation 
of lysine 9 in histone H3 (see Figure 5–27). Once it has been established, 
heterochromatin  can  spread  because  these  histone  tail  modifications 
attract a set of heterochromatin-specific proteins, including histone-mod-
ifying enzymes, which then create the same histone tail modifications on 
adjacent  nucleosomes.  These  modifications  in  turn  recruit  more  of  the 
heterochromatin-specific  proteins,  causing  a  wave  of  condensed  chro-
matin  to  propagate  along  the  chromosome.  This  heterochromatin  will 
continue to spread until it encounters a barrier DNA sequence that stops 
the propagation (figure 5–29). In this manner, extended regions of het-
erochromatin can be established along the DNA.

colors (and the path of the DNa molecule represented by the central black line), heterochromatin and euchromatin each represent 
a set of different chromatin structures with different degrees of condensation. Overall, heterochromatin is more condensed than 
euchromatin.

encounters a barrier DNa sequence that 
blocks its propagation into regions of 
euchromatin.

Most  DNA  that  is  permanently  folded  into  heterochromatin  in  the  cell 
does not contain genes. Because heterochromatin is so compact, genes 
that accidentally become packaged into heterochromatin usually fail to 
be expressed. Such inappropriate packaging of genes in heterochromatin 
can  cause  disease:  in  humans,  the  gene  that  encodes β-globin—which 
forms part of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecule—is situated next 
to a region of heterochromatin. If, because of an inherited DNA deletion, 
that heterochromatin spreads, the β-globin gene is poorly expressed and 
the person develops a severe form of anemia. 

Perhaps the most striking example of the use of heterochromatin to keep 
genes shut down, or silenced, is found in the interphase X chromosomes 
of female mammals. In mammals, female cells contain two X chromo-
somes, whereas male cells contain one X and one Y. Because a double 
dose of X-chromosome products would be lethal, female mammals have 
evolved  a  mechanism  for  permanently  inactivating  one  of  the  two  X 
chromosomes in each cell. At random, one or other of the two X chro-
mosomes in each cell becomes highly condensed into heterochromatin 
early in embryonic development. Thereafter, the condensed and inactive 
state of that X chromosome is inherited in all of the many descendants of 
those cells (figure 5–30). 

When a cell divides, it generally passes on its histone modifications, chro-
matin structure, and gene expression patterns to the two daughter cells. 
Such  “cell  memory”  is  critical  for  the  establishment  and  maintenance 
of different cell types during the development of a complex multicellu-
lar  organism.  We  discuss  the  mechanisms  involved  in  cell  memory  in 
Chapter 8, where we consider the control of gene expression.

mutations in a particular gene on 
the X chromosome result in color 
blindness in men. By contrast, most 
women carrying the mutation have 
proper color vision but see colored 
objects with reduced resolution, as 
though functional cone cells (the 
photoreceptor cells responsible for 
color vision) are spaced farther apart

observation? if a woman is color-

is inactivated in the cells of mammalian 
females by heterochromatin formation. each 
female cell contains two X chromosomes, one

development, one of these two chromosomes 
becomes condensed into heterochromatin

all mammalian females end up as mixtures

inactivated X chromosomes. In most of their

•	 When  a  gene  is  expressed,  part  of  its  nucleotide  sequence  is  tran-
scribed  into  RNA  molecules,  many  of  which  are  translated  into 
protein.

•	 The DNA that forms each eukaryotic chromosome contains, in addi-
tion  to  genes,  many  replication  origins,  one  centromere,  and  two 
telomeres.  These  special  DNA  sequences  ensure  that,  before  cell 
division,  each  chromosome  can  be  duplicated  efficiently,  and  that 
the resulting daughter chromosomes are parceled out equally to the 
two daughter cells. 

•	

In eukaryotic chromosomes, the DNA is tightly folded by binding to 
a set of histone and nonhistone proteins. This complex of DNA and 
protein is called chromatin. 

•	 Histones  pack  the  DNA  into  a  repeating  array  of  DNA–protein  par-
ticles  called  nucleosomes,  which  further  fold  up  into  even  more 
compact chromatin structures.

•	 A cell can regulate its chromatin structure—temporarily decondens-
ing  or  condensing  particular  regions  of  its  chromosomes—using 
chromatin-remodeling complexes and enzymes that covalently mod-
ify histone tails in various ways.

•	 The loosening of chromatin to a more decondensed state allows pro-
teins involved in gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair to 
gain access to the necessary DNA sequences.

•	 Some forms of chromatin have a pattern of histone tail modification 
that causes the DNA to become so highly condensed that its genes 
cannot be expressed to produce RNA; such condensation occurs on 
all chromosomes during mitosis and in the heterochromatin of inter-
phase chromosomes.

DNA Replication, Repair, and 
Recombination

The ability of a cell to survive and proliferate in a chaotic environment 
depends on the accurate duplication of the vast quantity of genetic infor-
mation carried in its DNA. This duplication process, called DNA replication, 
must occur before a cell can divide to produce two genetically identical 
daughter  cells.  Maintaining  order  in  a  cell  also  requires  the  continual 
surveillance and repair of its genetic information, as DNA is subjected to 
unavoidable damage by chemicals and radiation in the environment and 
by reactive molecules that are generated inside the cell. In this chapter, 
we describe the protein machines that replicate and repair the cell’s DNA. 
These  machines  catalyze  some  of  the  most  rapid  and  accurate  proc-
esses that take place within cells, and the strategies they have evolved to 
achieve this feat are marvels of elegance and efficiency.

Despite  these  systems  for  protecting  a  cell’s  DNA  from  copying  errors 
and accidental damage, permanent changes—or mutations—sometimes 
do  occur.  Although  most  mutations  do  not  affect  the  organism  in  any 
noticeable way, some have profound consequences. Occasionally, these 
changes  can  benefit  the  organism:  for  example,  mutations  can  make 
bacteria resistant to antibiotics that are used to kill them. What is more, 
changes in DNA sequence can produce small variations that underlie the 
differences between individuals of the same species (Figure 6–1); when 
allowed to accumulate over millions of years, such changes provide the 
variety in genetic material that makes one species distinct from another, 
as we discuss in Chapter 9. 

But, mutations are much more likely to be detrimental than beneficial: in 
humans, they are responsible for thousands of genetic diseases, including 
cancer. The survival of a cell or organism, therefore, depends on keeping

ChApteR 6     DNa replication, repair, and recombination

Figure 6–1 Genetic information is passed from one generation to 
the next. Differences in DNa can produce the variations that underlie 
the differences between individuals of the same species—or, over 
time, the differences between one species and another. In this family 
photo, the children resemble one another and their parents more 
closely than they resemble other people because they inherit their 
genes from their parents. the cat shares many features with humans, 
but during the millions of years of evolution that have separated 
humans and cats, both have accumulated many changes in DNa that 
now make the two species different. the chicken is an even more 
distant relative. 

changes in its DNA to a minimum. Without the protein machines that are 
continually monitoring and repairing damage to DNA, it is questionable 
whether life could exist at all.

dna replication
At  each  cell  division,  a  cell  must  copy  its  genome  with  extraordinary 
accuracy. In this section, we explore how the cell achieves this feat, while 
duplicating its DNA at rates as high as 1000 nucleotides per second. 

Base-pairing enables dna replication
In the preceding chapter, we saw that each strand of a DNA double helix 
contains  a  sequence  of  nucleotides  that  is  exactly  complementary  to 
the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand. Each strand can therefore 
serve as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary 
strand. In other words, if we designate the two DNA strands as S and Sʹ, 
strand S can serve as a template for making a new strand Sʹ, while strand 
Sʹ can serve as a template for making a new strand S (Figure 6–2). Thus, 
the genetic information in DNA can be accurately copied by the beauti-
fully simple process in which strand S separates from strand Sʹ, and each 
separated strand then serves as a template for the production of a new 
complementary partner strand that is identical to its former partner.

The  ability  of  each  strand  of  a  DNA  molecule  to  act  as  a  template  for 
producing  a  complementary  strand  enables  a  cell  to  copy,  or  replicate, 
its genes before passing them on to its descendants. But the task is awe-
inspiring, as it can involve copying billions of nucleotide pairs every time 
a cell divides. The copying must be carried out with incredible speed and 
accuracy: in about 8 hours, a dividing animal cell will copy the equivalent 
of 1000 books like this one and, on average, get no more than a few let-
ters wrong. This impressive feat is performed by a cluster of proteins that 
together form a replication machine.

ECB4 e6.01/6.01

Figure 6–2 DNA acts as a template 
for its own duplication. Because the 
nucleotide a will successfully pair only 
with t, and G with c, each strand of a 
DNa double helix—labeled here as 
the S strand and its complementary 
Sʹ strand—can serve as a template to 
specify the sequence of nucleotides in its 
complementary strand. In this way, both 
strands of a DNa double helix can be 
copied precisely.

Figure 6–3 in each round of DNA replication, each of the two 
strands of DNA is used as a template for the formation of a new, 
complementary strand. DNa replication is “semiconservative” 
because each daughter DNa double helix is composed of one 
conserved strand and one newly synthesized strand. 

DNA replication produces two complete double helices from the original 
DNA molecule, with each new DNA helix being identical (except for rare 
copying errors) in nucleotide sequence to the original DNA double helix 
(see Figure 6–2). Because each parental strand serves as the template for 
one new strand, each of the daughter DNA double helices ends up with 
one of the original (old) strands plus one strand that is completely new; 
this style of replication is said to be semiconservative (Figure 6–3). In how 
We  Know,  pp.  200–202,  we  discuss  the  experiments  that  first  demon-
strated that DNA is replicated in this way.

dna Synthesis Begins at replication origins
The DNA double helix is normally very stable: the two DNA strands are 
locked together firmly by the large numbers of hydrogen bonds between 
the bases on both strands (see Figure 5–2). As a result, only temperatures 
approaching  those  of  boiling  water  provide  enough  thermal  energy  to 
separate the two strands. To be used as a template, however, the double 
helix must first be opened up and the two strands separated to expose 
unpaired bases. How does this occur at the temperatures found in living 
cells? 

The process of DNA synthesis is begun by initiator proteins that bind to 
specific  DNA  sequences  called  replication  origins.  Here,  the  initiator 
proteins  pry  the  two  DNA  strands  apart,  breaking  the  hydrogen  bonds 
between  the  bases  (Figure  6–4).  Although  the  hydrogen  bonds  collec-
tively make the DNA helix very stable, individually each hydrogen bond 
is weak (as discussed in Chapter 2). Separating a short length of DNA a 
few base pairs at a time therefore does not require a large energy input, 
and  the  initiator  proteins  can  readily  unzip  the  double  helix  at  normal 
temperatures. 

In simple cells such as bacteria or yeast, replication origins span approxi-
mately 100 nucleotide pairs. They are composed of DNA sequences that 
attract the initiator proteins and are especially easy to open. We saw in 
Chapter 5 that an A-T base pair is held together by fewer hydrogen bonds 
than is a G-C base pair. Therefore, DNA rich in A-T base pairs is relatively 
easy to pull apart, and A-T-rich stretches of DNA are typically found at 
replication origins.

A bacterial genome, which is typically contained in a circular DNA mol-
ecule of several million nucleotide pairs, has a single replication origin. 
The human genome, which is very much larger, has approximately 10,000 
such  origins—an  average  of  220  origins  per  chromosome.  Beginning 
DNA replication at many places at once greatly shortens the time a cell 
needs to copy its entire genome.

hOW We KNOW
the NAtURe OF RepLiCAtiON

In  1953,  James  Watson  and  Francis  Crick  published 
their famous two-page paper describing a model for the 
structure of DNA (see Figure 5–2). In it, they proposed 
that complementary bases—adenine and thymine, gua-
nine  and  cytosine—pair  with  one  another  along  the 
center  of  the  double  helix,  holding  together  the  two 
strands of DNA. At the very end of this succinct scien-
tific blockbuster, they comment, almost as an aside, “It 
has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we 
have postulated immediately suggests a possible copy-
ing mechanism for the genetic material.”

Indeed, one month after the classic paper appeared in 
print in the journal Nature, Watson and Crick published 
a  second  article,  suggesting  how  DNA  might  be  dupli-
cated. In this paper, they proposed that the two strands 
of the double helix unwind, and that each strand serves 
as  a  template  for  the  synthesis  of  a  complementary 
daughter strand. In their model, dubbed semiconserva-
tive replication, each new DNA molecule consists of one 
strand  derived  from  the  original  parent  molecule  and 
one newly synthesized strand (Figure 6–5A). 
We now know that Watson and Crick’s model for DNA 
replication  was  correct—but  it  was  not  universally 
accepted  at  first.  Respected  physicist-turned-geneticist 
Max Delbrück, for one, got hung up on what he termed 
“the  untwiddling  problem;”  that  is:  how  could  the  two 
strands  of  a  double  helix,  twisted  around  each  other 

so many times all along their great length, possibly be 
unwound without making a big tangled mess? Watson 
and Crick’s conception of the DNA helix opening up like 
a  zipper  seemed,  to  Delbrück,  physically  unlikely  and 
simply “too inelegant to be efficient.”

Instead,  Delbrück  proposed  that  DNA  replication  pro-
ceeds through a series of breaks and reunions, in which 
the DNA backbone is broken and the strands are cop-
ied  in  short  segments—perhaps  only  10  nucleotides  at 
a time—before being rejoined. In this model, which was 
later  dubbed  dispersive,  the  resulting  copies  would  be 
patchwork collections of old and new DNA, each strand 
containing a mixture of both (Figure 6–5B). No unwind-
ing was necessary. 

Yet  a  third  camp  promoted  the  idea  that  DNA  replica-
tion might be conservative: that the parent helix would 
somehow remain entirely intact after copying, and the 
daughter molecule would contain two entirely new DNA 
strands  (Figure  6–5C).  To  determine  which  of  these 
models  was  correct,  an  experiment  was  needed—one 
that  would  reveal  the  composition  of  the  newly  syn-
thesized DNA strands. That’s where Matt Meselson and 
Frank Stahl came in.

As  a  graduate  student  working  with  Linus  Pauling, 
Meselson was toying with a method for telling the differ-
ence between old and new proteins. After chatting with 
Delbrück about Watson and Crick’s replication model, it

Figure 6–5 three models for DNA replication make different predictions. (a) In the semiconservative model, each parent strand 
serves as a template for the synthesis of a new daughter strand. the first round of replication would produce two hybrid molecules, 
each containing one strand from the original parent in addition to one newly synthesized strand. a subsequent round of replication 
would yield two hybrid molecules and two molecules that contain none of the original parent DNa (see Figure 6–3). (B) In the dispersive 
model, each generation of daughter DNa will contain a mixture of DNa from the parent strands and the newly synthesized DNa.  
(c) In the conservative model, the parent molecule remains intact after being copied. In this case, the first round of replication would 
yield the original parent double helix and an entirely new double helix. For each model, parent DNa molecules are shown in orange; 
newly replicated DNa is red. Note that only a very small segment of DNa is shown for each model.

occurred to Meselson that the approach he’d envisaged 
for exploring protein synthesis might also work for stud-
ying DNA. In the summer of 1954, Meselson met Stahl, 
who was then a graduate student in Rochester, NY, and 
they  agreed  to  collaborate.  It  took  a  few  years  to  get  
everything  working,  but  the  two  eventually  performed 
what  has  come  to  be  known  as  “the  most  beautiful 
experiment in biology.” 
Their approach, in retrospect, was stunningly straight-
forward. They started by growing two batches of E. coli 
bacteria,  one  in  a  medium  containing  a  heavy  isotope 
of nitrogen,  15N, the other in a medium containing the 
normal, lighter 14N. The nitrogen in the nutrient medium 
gets  incorporated  into  the  nucleotide  bases  and,  from 
there,  makes  its  way  into  the  DNA  of  the  organism. 
After growing bacterial cultures for many generations in 
either the 15N- or 14N-containing medium, the research-
ers  had  two  flasks  of  bacteria,  one  whose  DNA  was 
heavy,  the  other  whose  DNA  was  light.  Meselson  and 
Stahl then broke open the bacterial cells and loaded the 
DNA into tubes containing a high concentration of the 
salt cesium chloride. When these tubes are centrifuged 
at high speed, the cesium chloride forms a density gra-
dient,  and  the  DNA  molecules  float  or  sink  within  the 
solution until they reach the point at which their density 
equals that of the surrounding salt solution (see Panel 
4–3, pp. 164–165). Using this method, called equilibrium 

density  centrifugation,  Meselson  and  Stahl  found  that 
they  could  distinguish  between  heavy  (15N-containing) 
DNA  and  light  (14N-containing)  DNA  by  observing  the 
positions of the DNA within the cesium chloride gradi-
ent. Because the heavy DNA was denser than the light 
DNA, it collected at a position nearer to the bottom of 
the centrifuge tube (Figure 6–6).

Once they had established this method for differentiat-
ing between light and heavy DNA, Meselson and Stahl 
set out to test the various hypotheses proposed for DNA 
replication. To do this, they took a flask of bacteria that 
had been grown in heavy nitrogen and transferred the 
bacteria into a medium containing the light isotope. At 
the start of the experiment, all the DNA would be heavy. 
But, as the bacteria divided, the newly synthesized DNA 
would be light. They could then monitor the accumula-
tion of light DNA and see which model, if any, best fit the 
data.  After  one  generation  of  growth,  the  researchers 
found  that  the  parental,  heavy  DNA  molecules—those 
made of two strands containing  15N—had disappeared 
and were replaced by a new species of DNA that banded 
at a density halfway between those of 15N-DNA and 14N-
DNA  (Figure  6–7).  These  newly  synthesized  daughter 
helices, Meselson and Stahl reasoned, must be hybrids—
containing both heavy and light isotopes. 

Right  away,  this  observation  ruled  out  the  conserva-
tive  model  of  DNA  replication,  which  predicted  that

Figure 6–6 Centrifugation in a 
cesium chloride gradient allows 
the separation of heavy and light 
DNA. Bacteria are grown for several 
generations in a medium containing 
either 15N (the heavy isotope) or 14N 
(the light isotope) to label their DNa. 
the cells are then broken open, and the 
DNa is loaded into an ultracentrifuge 
tube containing a cesium chloride salt 
solution. these tubes are centrifuged 
at high speed for two days to allow 
the DNa to collect in a region where 
its density matches that of the salt 
surrounding it. the heavy and light 
DNa molecules collect in different 
positions in the tube.

To  distinguish  between  the  two 
models,  Meselson  and  Stahl  turned 
up  the  heat.  When  DNA  is  sub-

the

strands 
the 
helix  comes  apart,  leaving  a  collec-
tion of single-stranded DNAs. When 
the  researchers  heated  their  hybrid 
molecules  before  centrifuging,  they 
discovered  that  one  strand  of  the 
DNA  was  heavy,  whereas  the  other 
was  light.  This  observation  sup-
ported  only  the  semiconservative 
model; if the dispersive model were 
correct,  the  resulting  strands,  each 
containing  a  mottled  assembly  of 
heavy and light DNA, would have all 
banded  together  at  an  intermediate 
density. 

ECB4 e6.08/6.07

Figure 6–7 the first part of the Meselson–stahl experiment ruled out the 
conservative model of DNA replication. (a) Bacteria grown in light medium 
(containing 14N) yield DNa that forms a band high up in the centrifuge tube, whereas 
bacteria grown in 15N-containing heavy medium (B) produce DNa that migrates 
further down the tube. When bacteria grown in a heavy medium are transferred 
to a light medium and allowed to continue dividing, they produce a band whose 
position falls somewhere between that of the parent bands (c). these results rule 
out the conservative model of replication but do not distinguish between the 
semiconservative and dispersive models, both of which predict the formation of hybrid 
daughter DNa molecules.  
   the fact that the results came out looking so clean—with discrete bands forming 
at the expected positions for newly replicated hybrid DNa molecules—was a happy 
accident of the experimental protocol. the researchers used a hypodermic syringe to 
load their DNa samples into the ultracentrifuge tubes (see Figure 6–6). In the process, 
they unwittingly sheared the large bacterial chromosome into smaller fragments. 
had the chromosomes remained whole, the researchers might have isolated DNa 
molecules that were only partially replicated, because many cells would have been 
caught in the middle of copying their DNa. Molecules in such an intermediate stage 
of replication would not have separated into such discrete bands. But because the 
researchers were instead working with smaller pieces of DNa, the likelihood that any 
given fragment had been fully replicated—and contained a complete parent and 
daughter strand—was high, thus yielding nice, clean results.

According 
to  historian  Frederic 
Lawrence  Holmes,  the  experiment 
was  so  elegant  and  the  results 
so  clean  that  Stahl—when  being 
interviewed  for  a  position  at  Yale 
University—was unable to fill the 50 
minutes  allotted  for  his  talk.  “I  was 
finished  in  25  minutes,”  said  Stahl, 
“because that is all it takes to tell that 
experiment. It’s so totally simple and 
contained.” Stahl did not get the job 
at Yale, but the experiment convinced 
biologists that Watson and Crick had 
been correct. In fact, the results were 
accepted  so  widely  and  rapidly  that 
the  experiment  was  described  in  a 
textbook before Meselson and Stahl 
had even published the data. 

each replication origin (Figure 6–8). At each fork, a replication machine 
moves along the DNA, opening up the two strands of the double helix 
and using each strand as a template to make a new daughter strand. The 
two forks move away from the origin in opposite directions, unzipping 
the DNA double helix and replicating the DNA as they go (Figure 6–9). 
DNA  replication  in  bacterial  and  eukaryotic  chromosomes  is  therefore 
termed bidirectional. The forks move very rapidly—at about 1000 nucle-
otide pairs per second in bacteria and 100 nucleotide pairs per second 
in humans. The slower rate of fork movement in humans (indeed, in all 
eukaryotes) may be due to the difficulties in replicating DNA through the 
more complex chromatin structure of eukaryotic chromosomes.

dna polymerase Synthesizes dna Using a parental Strand 
as template
The movement of a replication fork is driven by the action of the replica-
tion machine, at the heart of which is an enzyme called DNA polymerase. 
This enzyme catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the 3ʹ end of a grow-
ing  DNA  strand,  using  one  of  the  original,  parental  DNA  strands  as  a 
template. Base pairing between an incoming nucleotide and the template 
strand  determines  which  of  the  four  nucleotides  (A,  G,  T,  or  C)  will  be 
selected. The final product is a new strand of DNA that is complementary 
in nucleotide sequence to the template (Figure 6–10).

The polymerization reaction involves the formation of a phosphodiester 
bond between the 3ʹ end of the growing DNA chain and the 5ʹ-phosphate 
group of the incoming nucleotide, which enters the reaction as a deoxy-
ribonucleoside  triphosphate.  The  energy  for  polymerization  is  provided

by  the  incoming  deoxyribonucleoside  triphosphate  itself:  hydrolysis 
of one of its high-energy phosphate bonds fuels the reaction that links 
the nucleotide monomer to the chain, releasing pyrophosphate (Figure 
6–11). Pyrophosphate is further hydrolyzed to inorganic phosphate (Pi), 
which  makes  the  polymerization  reaction  effectively  irreversible  (see 
Figure 3–41).

DNA polymerase does not dissociate from the DNA each time it adds a 
new nucleotide to the growing strand; rather, it stays associated with the 
DNA and moves along the template strand stepwise for many cycles of 
the polymerization reaction (Movie 6.1). We will see later that a special 
protein keeps the polymerase attached to the DNA, as it repeatedly adds 
new nucleotides to the growing strand.

the replication Fork is asymmetrical
The 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction of the DNA polymerization reaction poses a problem 
at the replication fork. As illustrated in Figure 5–2, the sugar–phosphate 
backbone of each strand of a DNA double helix has a unique chemical 
direction, or polarity, determined by the way each sugar residue is linked 
to the next, and the two strands in the double helix are antiparallel; that 
is,  they  run  in  opposite  directions.  As  a  consequence,  at  each  replica-
tion  fork,  one  new  DNA  strand  is  being  made  on  a  template  that  runs 
in one direction (3ʹ to 5ʹ), whereas the other new strand is being made 
on a template that runs in the opposite direction (5ʹ to 3ʹ) (Figure 6–12). 
The replication fork is therefore asymmetrical. Looking at Figure 6–9A, 
however, it appears that both of the new DNA strands are growing in the 
same direction; that is, the direction in which the replication fork is mov-
ing. That observation suggests that one strand is being synthesized in the 
5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction and the other in the 3ʹ-to-5ʹ direction.

Figure 6–11 DNA polymerase adds a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3ʹ end of a growing DNA chain. (a) Nucleotides enter the 
reaction as deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. this incoming nucleotide forms a base pair with its partner in the template strand. 
It is then linked to the free 3ʹ hydroxyl on the growing DNa strand. the new DNa strand is therefore synthesized in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ 
direction. Breakage of a high-energy phosphate bond in the incoming nucleoside triphosphate—accompanied by the release of 
pyrophosphate—provides the energy for the polymerization reaction. (B) the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme DNa polymerase

Figure 6–12 At a replication fork, the two 
newly synthesized DNA strands are of 
opposite polarities. this is because the two 
template strands are oriented in opposite 
directions.

ECB4 e6.11/6.12

Does the cell have two types of DNA polymerase, one for each direction? 
The answer is no: all DNA polymerases add new subunits only to the 3ʹ 
end of a DNA strand (see Figure 6–11A). As a result, a new DNA chain 
can be synthesized only in a 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction. This can easily account 
for the synthesis of one of the two strands of DNA at the replication fork, 
but what happens on the other? This conundrum is solved by the use of 
a “backstitching” maneuver. The DNA strand that appears to grow in the 
incorrect  3ʹ-to-5ʹ  direction  is  actually  made  discontinuously,  in  succes-
sive, separate, small pieces—with the DNA polymerase moving backward 
with respect to the direction of replication-fork movement so that each 
new DNA fragment can be polymerized in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction. 
The  resulting  small  DNA  pieces—called  Okazaki  fragments  after  the 
biochemists  who  discovered  them—are  later  joined  together  to  form  a 
continuous new strand. The DNA strand that is made discontinuously in 
this way is called the lagging strand, because the backstitching imparts 
a slight delay to its synthesis; the other strand, which is synthesized con-
tinuously, is called the leading strand (Figure 6–13).

Although  they  differ  in  subtle  details,  the  replication  forks  of  all  cells, 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic, have leading and lagging strands. This com-
mon feature arises from the fact that all DNA polymerases work only in 
the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction—a restriction that provides cells with an important 
advantage, as we discuss next.

dna polymerase is Self-correcting
DNA  polymerase  is  so  accurate  that  it  makes  only  about  one  error  in 
every 107 nucleotide pairs it copies. This error rate is much lower than 
can be explained simply by the accuracy of complementary base-pairing. 
Although A-T and C-G are by far the most stable base pairs, other, less 
stable base pairs—for example, G-T and C-A—can also be formed. Such 
incorrect base pairs are formed much less frequently than correct ones, 
but, if allowed to remain, they would result in an accumulation of muta-
tions. This disaster is avoided because DNA polymerase has two special 
qualities  that  greatly  increase  the  accuracy  of  DNA  replication.  First, 
the  enzyme  carefully  monitors  the  base-pairing  between  each  incom-
ing nucleotide and the template strand. Only when the match is correct 
does DNA polymerase catalyze the nucleotide-addition reaction. Second,

Figure 6–13 At each replication fork, the 
lagging DNA strand is synthesized in 
pieces. Because both of the new strands 
at a replication fork are synthesized in the 
5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction, the lagging strand of 
DNa must be made initially as a series of 
short DNa strands, which are later joined 
together. the upper diagram shows two 
replication forks moving in opposite 
directions; the lower diagram shows the 
same forks a short time later. to replicate 
the lagging strand, DNa polymerase uses 
a backstitching mechanism: it synthesizes 
short pieces of DNa (called Okazaki 
fragments) in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction and then 
moves back along the template strand 
(toward the fork) before synthesizing the 
next fragment.

Figure 6–14 During DNA synthesis, DNA 
polymerase proofreads its own work. If an 
incorrect nucleotide is added to a growing 
strand, the DNa polymerase cleaves it from 
the strand and replaces it with the correct 
nucleotide before continuing. 

ECB4 e6.13/6.14

Figure 6–15 DNA polymerase contains 
separate sites for DNA synthesis and 
proofreading. the diagrams are based on 
the structure of an E. coli DNa polymerase 
molecule, as determined by X-ray 
crystallography. DNa polymerase is shown 
with the replicating DNa molecule and the 
polymerase in the polymerizing mode (left) 
and in the proofreading mode (right). the 
catalytic sites for the polymerization activity 
(p) and error-correcting proofreading activity 
(e) are indicated. When the polymerase 
adds an incorrect nucleotide, the newly 
synthesized DNa strand (red ) transiently 
unpairs from the template strand (orange), 
and its growing 3ʹ end moves into the error-
correcting catalytic site (e) to be removed.

when DNA polymerase makes a rare mistake and adds the wrong nucle-
otide, it can correct the error through an activity called proofreading. 

Proofreading takes place at the same time as DNA synthesis. Before the 
enzyme  adds  the  next  nucleotide  to  a  growing  DNA  strand,  it  checks 
whether the previously added nucleotide is correctly base-paired to the 
template strand. If so, the polymerase adds the next nucleotide; if not, 
the polymerase clips off the mispaired nucleotide and tries again (Figure 
6–14).  This  proofreading  is  carried  out  by  a  nuclease  that  cleaves  the 
phosphodiester  backbone.  Polymerization  and  proofreading  are  tightly 
coordinated, and the two reactions are carried out by different catalytic 
domains in the same polymerase molecule (Figure 6–15).

This proofreading mechanism explains why DNA polymerases synthesize 
DNA only in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction, despite the need that this imposes for a 
cumbersome backstitching mechanism at the replication fork (see Figure 
6–13).  A  hypothetical  DNA  polymerase  that  synthesized  in  the  3ʹ-to-5ʹ 
direction  (and  would  thereby  circumvent  the  need  for  backstitching) 
would be unable to proofread: if it removed an incorrectly paired nucle-
otide, the polymerase would create a chemical dead end—a chain that 
could no longer be elongated. Thus, for a DNA polymerase to function 
as a self-correcting enzyme that removes its own polymerization errors 
as it moves along the DNA, it must proceed only in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction.

Short lengths of rna act as primers for dna Synthesis
We  have  seen  that  the  accuracy  of  DNA  replication  depends  on  the 
requirement  of  the  DNA  polymerase  for  a  correctly  base-paired  3ʹ  end 
before it can add more nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. How then 
can  the  polymerase  begin  a  completely  new  DNA  strand?  To  get  the 
process started, a different enzyme is needed—one that can begin a new 
polynucleotide strand simply by joining two nucleotides together without 
the  need  for  a  base-paired  end.  This  enzyme  does  not,  however,  syn-
thesize DNA. It makes a short length of a closely related type of nucleic 
acid—RNA (ribonucleic acid)—using the DNA strand as a template. This 
short length of RNA, about 10 nucleotides long, is base-paired to the tem-
plate strand and provides a base-paired 3ʹ end as a starting point for DNA 
polymerase. It thus serves as a primer for DNA synthesis, and the enzyme 
that synthesizes the RNA primer is known as primase. 

Primase is an example of an RNA polymerase, an enzyme that synthesizes 
RNA using DNA as a template. A strand of RNA is very similar chemically 
to a single strand of DNA except that it is made of ribonucleotide subu-
nits, in which the sugar is ribose, not deoxyribose; RNA also differs from 
DNA  in  that  it  contains  the  base  uracil  (U)  instead  of  thymine  (T)  (see 
Panel  2–6,  pp.  76–77).  However,  because  U  can  form  a  base  pair  with 
A, the RNA primer is synthesized on the DNA strand by complementary 
base-pairing in exactly the same way as is DNA (Figure 6–16).

Figure 6–16 RNA primers are synthesized by an RNA polymerase 
called primase, which uses a DNA strand as a template. Like DNa 
polymerase, primase works in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction. Unlike DNa 
polymerase, however, primase can start a new polynucleotide chain by 
joining together two nucleoside triphosphates without the need for 
a base-paired 3ʹ end as a starting point. (In this case, ribonucleoside 
triphosphates, rather than deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, provide 
the incoming nucleotides.)

For  the  leading  strand,  an  RNA  primer  is  needed  only  to  start  replica-
tion at a replication origin; once a replication fork has been established, 
the  DNA  polymerase  is  continuously  presented  with  a  base-paired  3ʹ 
end  as  it  tracks  along  the  template  strand.  But  on  the  lagging  strand, 
where  DNA  synthesis  is  discontinuous,  new  primers  are  needed  to 
keep  polymerization  going  (see  Figure  6–13).  The  movement  of  the 
replication  fork  continually  exposes  unpaired  bases  on  the  lagging 
strand template, and new RNA primers are laid down at intervals along 
the  newly  exposed,  single-stranded  stretch.  DNA  polymerase  adds  a  
deoxyribonucleotide to the 3ʹ end of each primer to start a new Okazaki 
fragment, and it will continue to elongate this fragment until it runs into 
the next RNA primer (Figure 6–17). 

To produce a continuous new DNA strand from the many separate pieces 
of nucleic acid made on the lagging strand, three additional enzymes are 
needed. These act quickly to remove the RNA primer, replace it with DNA, 
and join the DNA fragments together. Thus, a nuclease degrades the RNA 
primer, a DNA polymerase called a repair polymerase then replaces this 
RNA  with  DNA  (using  the  end  of  the  adjacent  Okazaki  fragment  as  a 
primer), and the enzyme DNA ligase joins the 5ʹ-phosphate end of one 
DNA fragment to the adjacent 3ʹ-hydroxyl end of the next (Figure 6–18). 
Primase can begin new polynucleotide chains, but this activity is possible 
because the enzyme does not proofread its work. As a result, primers fre-
quently contain mistakes. But because primers are made of RNA instead 
of DNA, they stand out as “suspect copy” to be automatically removed 
and replaced by DNA. The repair DNA polymerases that make this DNA, 
like  the  replicative  polymerases,  proofread  as  they  synthesize.  In  this 
way,  the  cell’s  replication  machinery  is  able  to  begin  new  DNA  chains 
and, at the same time, ensure that all of the DNA is copied faithfully.

proteins at a replication Fork cooperate to Form  
a replication Machine
DNA replication requires the cooperation of a large number of proteins 
that act in concert to open up the double helix and synthesize new DNA. 
These proteins form part of a remarkably complex replication machine. 
The  first  problem  faced  by  the  replication  machine  is  accessing  the 

Figure 6–17 Multiple enzymes are required to synthesize Okazaki 
fragments on the lagging DNA strand. In eukaryotes, rNa primers 
are made at intervals of about 200 nucleotides on the lagging strand, 
and each rNa primer is approximately 10 nucleotides long. primers 
are removed by nucleases that recognize an rNa strand in an rNa/
DNa helix and degrade it; this leaves gaps that are filled in by a 
repair DNa polymerase that can proofread as it fills in the gaps. the 
completed fragments are finally joined together by an enzyme called 
DNa ligase, which catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond 
between the 3ʹ-Oh end of one fragment and the 5ʹ-phosphate end of 
the next, thus linking up the sugar–phosphate backbones. this nick-
sealing reaction requires an input of energy in the form of atp (not 
shown; see Figure 6–18).

nucleotides that lie at the center of the helix. For DNA replication to occur, 
the double helix must be unzipped ahead of the replication fork so that 
the  incoming  nucleoside  triphosphates  can  form  base  pairs  with  each 
template  strand.  Two  types  of  replication  proteins—DNA  helicases  and 
single-strand DNA-binding proteins—cooperate to carry out this task. The 
helicase sits at the very front of the replication machine where it uses the 
energy of ATP hydrolysis to propel itself forward, prying apart the double 
helix as it speeds along the DNA (Figure 6–19A and Movie 6.2). Single-
strand DNA-binding proteins cling to the single-stranded DNA exposed 
by the helicase, transiently preventing the strands from re-forming base 
pairs and keeping them in an elongated form so that they can serve as 
efficient templates. 

This localized unwinding of the DNA double helix itself presents a prob-
lem. As the helicase pries open the DNA within the replication fork, the

strands apart to provide access for the 
primase and polymerase. For simplicity, 
this diagram shows the proteins working 
independently; in the cell, they are held 
together in a large replication machine, 
as shown in (B). 
   (B) this diagram shows a current view of 
how the replication proteins are arranged 
when a replication fork is moving. to 
generate this structure, the lagging 
strand shown in (a) has been folded to 
bring its DNa polymerase in contact with 
the leading-strand DNa polymerase. this 
folding process also brings the 3ʹ end 
of each completed Okazaki fragment 
close to the start site for the next Okazaki 
fragment. Because the lagging-strand 
DNa polymerase is bound to the rest 
of the replication proteins, it can be 
reused to synthesize successive Okazaki 
fragments; in this diagram, the lagging-
strand DNa polymerase is about to let go 
of its completed Okazaki fragment and 
move to the rNa primer that is being 
synthesized by the nearby primase. to

DNA on the other side of the fork gets wound more tightly. This excess 
twisting in front of the replication fork creates tension in the DNA that—if 
allowed  to  build—makes  unwinding  the  double  helix  increasingly  diffi-
cult  and  impedes  the  forward  movement  of  the  replication  machinery 
(Figure 6–20A). Cells use proteins called DNA topoisomerases to relieve 
this tension. These enzymes produce transient nicks in the DNA back-
bone,  which  temporarily  release  the  tension;  they  then  reseal  the  nick 
before falling off the DNA (Figure 6–20B).
An  additional  replication  protein,  called  a  sliding  clamp,  keeps  DNA 
polymerase firmly attached to the template while it is synthesizing new 
strands of DNA. Left on their own, most DNA polymerase molecules will 
synthesize only a short string of nucleotides before falling off the DNA 
template strand. The sliding clamp forms a ring around the newly formed 
DNA  double  helix  and,  by  tightly  gripping  the  polymerase,  allows  the 
enzyme to move along the template strand without falling off as it syn-
thesizes new DNA (see Figure 6–19A and Movie 6.3). 

Assembly of the clamp around DNA requires the activity of another repli-
cation protein, the clamp loader, which hydrolyzes ATP each time it locks 
a sliding clamp around a newly formed DNA double helix. This loading 
needs to occur only once per replication cycle on the leading strand; on 
the lagging strand, however, the clamp is removed and then reattached 
each time a new Okazaki fragment is made. 

Most  of  the  proteins  involved  in  DNA  replication  are  held  together  in 
a  large  multienzyme  complex  that  moves  as  a  unit  along  the  parental 
DNA double helix, enabling DNA to be synthesized on both strands in a 
coordinated manner. This complex can be likened to a miniature sewing 
machine composed of protein parts and powered by nucleoside triphos-
phate hydrolysis (Figure 6–19B and Movies 6.4 and 6.5).

Figure 6–21 Without a special mechanism to replicate the ends of linear 
chromosomes, DNA would be lost during each round of cell division. DNa 
synthesis begins at origins of replication and continues until the replication 
machinery reaches the ends of the chromosome. the leading strand is reproduced in 
its entirety. But the ends of the lagging strand can’t be completed, because once the 
final rNa primer has been removed there is no way to replace it with DNa. these 
gaps at the ends of the lagging strand must be filled in by a special mechanism to 
keep the chromosome ends from shrinking with each cell division. 

ECB4 N6.101/6.21

of  replicating  the  very  ends  of  chromosomes.  As  we  discussed  previ-
ously,  because  DNA  replication  proceeds  only  in  the  5ʹ-to-3ʹ  direction, 
the  lagging  strand  of  the  replication  fork  has  to  be  synthesized  in  the 
form of discontinuous DNA fragments, each of which is primed with an 
RNA primer laid down by a primase (see Figure 6–17). A serious problem 
arises, however, as the replication fork approaches the end of a chromo-
some: although the leading strand can be replicated all the way to the 
chromosome tip, the lagging strand cannot. When the final RNA primer 
on the lagging strand is removed, there is no way to replace it (Figure 
6–21). Without a strategy to deal with this problem, the lagging strand 
would become shorter with each round of DNA replication; after repeated 
cell divisions, chromosomes would shrink—and eventually lose valuable 
genetic information. 

Bacteria  solve  this  “end-replication”  problem  by  having  circular  DNA 
molecules as chromosomes. Eukaryotes solve it by having long, repeti-
tive nucleotide sequences at the ends of their chromosomes which are 
incorporated  into  structures  called  telomeres.  These  telomeric  DNA 
sequences  attract  an  enzyme  called  telomerase  to  the  chromosome 
ends. Using an RNA template that is part of the enzyme itself, telomerase 
extends the ends of the replicating lagging strand by adding multiple cop-
ies of the same short DNA sequence to the template strand. This extended 
template allows replication of the lagging strand to be completed by con-
ventional DNA replication (Figure 6–22). 

In addition to allowing replication of chromosome ends, telomeres form 
structures that mark the true ends of a chromosome. This allows the cell 
to distinguish unambiguously between the natural ends of chromosomes 
and the double-strand DNA breaks that sometimes occur accidentally in

prevent linear eukaryotic chromosomes 
from shortening with each cell division. 
For clarity, only the template DNa (orange) 
and newly synthesized DNa (red) of the 
lagging strand are shown (see bottom of 
Figure 6–21). to complete the replication 
of the lagging strand at the ends of a 
chromosome, the template strand is first 
extended beyond the DNa that is to 
be copied. to achieve this, the enzyme 
telomerase adds more repeats to the 
telomere repeat sequences at the 3ʹ end of 
the template strand, which then allows the 
lagging strand to be completed by DNa 
polymerase, as shown. the telomerase 
enzyme carries a short piece of rNa (blue) 
with a sequence that is complementary to 
the DNa repeat sequence; this rNa acts as 
the template for telomere DNa synthesis. 
after the lagging-strand replication 
is complete, a short stretch of single-
stranded DNa remains at the ends of the 
chromosome, as shown. to see telomerase

dna repair
The diversity of living organisms and their success in colonizing almost 
every part of the Earth’s surface depend on genetic changes accumulated 
gradually over millions of years. Some of these changes allow organisms 
to adapt to changing conditions and to thrive in new habitats. However, 
in  the  short  term,  and  from  the  perspective  of  an  individual  organism, 
genetic alterations can be detrimental. In a multicellular organism, such 
permanent changes in the DNA—called mutations—can upset the organ-
ism’s extremely complex and finely tuned development and physiology. 

To  survive  and  reproduce,  individuals  must  be  genetically  stable.  This 
stability is achieved not only through the extremely accurate mechanism 
for  replicating  DNA  that  we  have  just  discussed,  but  also  through  the 
work of a variety of protein machines that continually scan the genome 
for damage and fix it when it occurs. Although some changes arise from 
rare mistakes in the replication process, the majority of DNA damage is 
an  unintended  consequence  of  the  vast  number  of  chemical  reactions 
that occur inside cells. 

Most DNA damage is only temporary, because it is immediately corrected 
by processes collectively called DNA repair. The importance of these DNA 
repair processes is evident from the consequences of their malfunction. 
Humans with the genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, for example, 
cannot mend the damage done by ultraviolet (UV) radiation because they 
have inherited a defective gene for one of the proteins involved in this 
repair  process.  Such  individuals  develop  severe  skin  lesions,  including 
skin cancer, because of the accumulation of DNA damage in cells that 
are exposed to sunlight and the consequent mutations that arise in these 
cells. 

In  this  section,  we  describe  a  few  of  the  specialized  mechanisms  cells 
use to repair DNA damage. We then consider examples of what happens 
when these mechanisms fail—and discuss how the fidelity of DNA repli-
cation and repair are reflected in our genome.

chemical reactions known to create 
serious DNA damage in cells. 
(a) Depurination can remove guanine 
(or adenine) from DNa. (B) the major 
type of deamination reaction converts 
cytosine to an altered DNa base, uracil; 
however, deamination can also occur on

DNa, and neither break the phosphodiester

discuss the following statement: 
“the dna repair enzymes that 
fix deamination and depurination 
damage must preferentially 
recognize such damage on newly 
synthesized dna strands.”

dna damage occurs continually in cells
Just like any other molecule in the cell, DNA is continually undergoing 
thermal collisions with other molecules, often resulting in major chemi-
cal  changes  in  the  DNA.  For  example,  during  the  time  it  takes  to  read 
this  sentence,  a  total  of  about  a  trillion  (1012)  purine  bases  (A  and  G) 
will be lost from DNA in the cells of your body by a spontaneous reac-
tion called depurination (Figure 6–23A). Depurination does not break the 
DNA phosphodiester backbone but instead removes a purine base from a 
nucleotide, giving rise to lesions that resemble missing teeth (see Figure 
6–25B). Another common reaction is the spontaneous loss of an amino 
group (deamination) from a cytosine in DNA to produce the base uracil 
(Figure 6–23B). Some chemically reactive by-products of cell metabolism 
also occasionally react with the bases in DNA, altering them in such a 
way that their base-pairing properties are changed. 

ECB4 m5.45/6.28

The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is also damaging to DNA; it promotes 
covalent  linkage  between  two  adjacent  pyrimidine  bases,  forming,  for 
example,  the  thymine  dimer  shown  in  Figure  6–24.  It  is  the  failure  to 
repair thymine dimers that spells trouble for individuals with the disease 
xeroderma pigmentosum. 

Figure 6–24 the ultraviolet radiation 
in sunlight can cause the formation of 
thymine dimers. two adjacent thymine 
bases have become covalently attached 
to each other to form a thymine dimer. 
Skin cells that are exposed to sunlight 
are especially susceptible to this type of 
DNa damage.

Figure 6–25 Chemical modifications of 
nucleotides, if left unrepaired, produce 
mutations. (a) Deamination of cytosine, 
if uncorrected, results in the substitution 
of one base for another when the DNa 
is replicated. as shown in Figure 6–23B, 
deamination of cytosine produces uracil. 
Uracil differs from cytosine in its base-
pairing properties and preferentially 
base-pairs with adenine. the DNa 
replication machinery therefore inserts 
an adenine when it encounters a uracil 
on the template strand. (B) Depurination, 
if uncorrected, can lead to the loss of 
a nucleotide pair. When the replication 
machinery encounters a missing purine 
on the template strand, it can skip to the 
next complete nucleotide, as shown, thus 
producing a daughter DNa molecule that 
is missing one nucleotide pair. In other 
cases (not shown), the replication machinery 
places an incorrect nucleotide across from 
the missing base, again resulting in a 
mutation.

These are only a few of many chemical changes that can occur in our 
DNA. If left unrepaired, many of them would lead either to the substitu-
tion of one nucleotide pair for another as a result of incorrect base-pairing 
during replication (Figure 6–25A) or to deletion of one or more nucleotide 
pairs in the daughter DNA strand after DNA replication (Figure 6–25B). 
Some types of DNA damage (thymine dimers, for example) can stall the 
DNA replication machinery at the site of the damage. 

In addition to this chemical damage, DNA can also be altered by repli-
cation itself. The replication machinery that copies the DNA can—quite 
rarely—incorporate  an  incorrect  nucleotide  that  it  fails  to  correct  via 
proofreading (see Figure 6–14).

For each of these forms of DNA, cells possess a mechanism for repair, as 
we discuss next.

ECB4 e6.25/6.30

cells possess a Variety of Mechanisms for repairing dna
The thousands of random chemical changes that occur every day in the 
DNA  of  a  human  cell—through  thermal  collisions  or  exposure  to  reac-
tive metabolic by-products, DNA-damaging chemicals, or radiation—are 
repaired  by  a  variety  of  mechanisms,  each  catalyzed  by  a  different  set 
of  enzymes.  Nearly  all  these  repair  mechanisms  depend  on  the  dou-
ble-helical  structure  of  DNA,  which  provides  two  copies  of  the  genetic 
information—one in each strand of the double helix. Thus, if the sequence 
in one strand is accidentally damaged, information is not lost irretriev-
ably,  because  a  backup  version  of  the  altered  strand  remains  in  the 
complementary sequence of nucleotides in the other strand. Most DNA 
damage creates structures that are never encountered in an undamaged 
DNA strand; thus the good strand is easily distinguished from the bad. 

The basic pathway for repairing damage to DNA, illustrated schematically 
in Figure 6–26, involves three basic steps:
 

1.  The damaged DNA is recognized and removed by one of a variety 
of mechanisms. These involve nucleases, which cleave the cova-
lent bonds that join the damaged nucleotides to the rest of the DNA 
strand, leaving a small gap on one strand of the DNA double helix 
in the region. 

 

2.  A  repair  DNA  polymerase  binds  to  the  3ʹ-hydroxyl  end  of  the  cut 
DNA  strand.  It  then  fills  in  the  gap  by  making  a  complementary 
copy of the information stored in the undamaged strand. Although

Figure 6–26 the basic mechanism of 
DNA repair involves three steps. In step 1 
(excision), the damage is cut out by one of 
a series of nucleases, each specialized for a 
type of DNa damage. In step 2 (resynthesis), 
the original DNa sequence is restored by 
a repair DNa polymerase, which fills in the 
gap created by the excision events. In step 
3 (ligation), DNa ligase seals the nick left 
in the sugar–phosphate backbone of the 
repaired strand. Nick sealing, which requires 
energy from atp hydrolysis, remakes the 
broken phosphodiester bond between the 
adjacent nucleotides (see Figure 6–18). 

different  from  the  DNA  polymerase  that  replicates  DNA,  repair 
DNA  polymerases  synthesize  DNA  strands  in  the  same  way.  For 
example,  they  elongate  chains  in  the  5ʹ-to-3ʹ  direction  and  have 
the same type of proofreading activity to ensure that the template 
strand is copied accurately. In many cells, this is the same enzyme 
that fills in the gap left after the RNA primers are removed during 
the normal DNA replication process (see Figure 6–17).

 

3.  When  the  repair  DNA  polymerase  has  filled  in  the  gap,  a  break 
remains in the sugar–phosphate backbone of the repaired strand. 
This nick in the helix is sealed by DNA ligase, the same enzyme 
that joins the Okazaki fragments during replication of the lagging 
DNA strand.

Steps  2  and  3  are  nearly  the  same  for  most  types  of  DNA  damage, 
including  the  rare  errors  that  arise  during  DNA  replication.  However, 
step 1 uses a series of different enzymes, each specialized for removing 
different types of DNA damage. Humans produce hundreds of different 
proteins that function in DNA repair.

a dna Mismatch repair System removes replication 
errors that escape proofreading
Although the high fidelity and proofreading abilities of the cell’s replica-
tion machinery generally prevent replication errors from occurring, rare 
mistakes do happen. Fortunately, the cell has a backup system—called 
mismatch  repair—which  is  dedicated  to  correcting  these  errors.  The 
replication  machine  makes  approximately  one  mistake  per  107  nucle-
otides  copied;  DNA  mismatch  repair  corrects  99%  of  these  replication 
errors, increasing the overall accuracy to one mistake in 109 nucleotides 
copied. This level of accuracy is much, much higher than that generally 
encountered in our day-to-day lives (table 6–1).

Whenever the replication machinery makes a copying mistake, it leaves 
behind  a  mispaired  nucleotide  (commonly  called  a  mismatch).  If  left 
uncorrected,  the  mismatch  will  result  in  a  permanent  mutation  in  the 
next  round  of  DNA  replication  (Figure  6–27).  A  complex  of  mismatch 
repair proteins recognizes such a DNA mismatch, removes a portion of 
the DNA strand containing the error, and then resynthesizes the missing 
DNA. This repair mechanism restores the correct sequence (Figure 6–28).

To be effective, the mismatch repair system must be able to recognize 
which  of  the  DNA  strands  contains  the  error.  Removing  a  segment 
from the strand of DNA that contains the correct sequence would only

compound the mistake. The way the mismatch system solves this prob-
lem is by always removing a portion of the newly made DNA strand. In 
bacteria, newly synthesized DNA lacks a type of chemical modification 
that is present on the preexisting parent DNA. Other cells use other strat-
egies for distinguishing their parent DNA from a newly replicated strand.

Mismatch repair plays an important role in preventing cancer. An inher-
ited  predisposition  to  certain  cancers  (especially  some  types  of  colon 
cancer)  is  caused  by  mutations  in  genes  that  encode  mismatch  repair 
proteins. Humans inherit two copies of these genes (one from each par-
ent),  and  individuals  who  inherit  one  damaged  mismatch  repair  gene 
are unaffected until the undamaged copy of the same gene is randomly 
mutated in a somatic cell. This mutant cell—and all of its progeny—are 
then deficient in mismatch repair; they therefore accumulate mutations 
more rapidly than do normal cells. Because cancers arise from cells that 
have accumulated multiple mutations, a cell deficient in mismatch repair 
has a greatly enhanced chance of becoming cancerous. Thus, inheriting 
a damaged mismatch repair gene strongly predisposes an individual to 
cancer.

ECB4 n6.102/6.26

double-Strand dna Breaks require a different Strategy 
for repair
The repair mechanisms we have discussed thus far rely on the genetic 
redundancy  built  into  every  DNA  double  helix.  If  nucleotides  on  one 
strand are damaged, they can be repaired using the information present 
in the complementary strand. 

But what happens when both strands of the double helix are damaged 
at the same time? Radiation, mishaps at the replication fork, and vari-
ous chemical assaults can all fracture the backbone of DNA, creating a

Figure 6–29 Cells can repair 
double-strand breaks in one of 
two ways. (a) In nonhomologous 
end joining, the break is first 
“cleaned” by a nuclease that 
chews back the broken ends 
to produce flush ends. the 
flush ends are then stitched 
together by a DNa ligase. Some 
nucleotides are lost in the repair 
process, as indicated by the black 
lines in the repaired DNa. (B) If 
a double-strand break occurs in 
one of two daughter DNa double 
helices after DNa replication 
has occurred, but before the 
daughter chromosomes have 
been separated, the undamaged

double-strand  break.  Such  lesions  are  particularly  dangerous,  because 
they can lead to the fragmentation of chromosomes and the subsequent 
loss of genes.

This  type  of  damage  is  especially  difficult  to  repair.  Each  chromosome 
contains  unique  information;  if  a  chromosome  undergoes  a  double-
strand break, and the broken pieces become separated, the cell has no 
spare copy it can use to reconstruct the information that is now missing.

To  handle  this  potentially  disastrous  type  of  DNA  damage,  cells  have 
evolved two basic strategies. The first involves rapidly sticking the broken 
ends back together, before the DNA fragments drift apart and get lost. 
This repair mechanism, called nonhomologous end joining, occurs in 
many cell types and is carried out by a specialized group of enzymes that 
“clean” the broken ends and rejoin them by DNA ligation. This “quick and 
dirty” mechanism rapidly repairs the damage, but it comes with a price: 
in “cleaning” the break to make it ready for ligation, nucleotides are often 
lost at the site of repair (Figure 6–29A). 

In  most  cases,  this  emergency  repair  mechanism  mends  the  damage 
without creating any additional problems. But if the imperfect repair dis-
rupts the activity of a gene, the cell could suffer serious consequences. 
Thus,  nonhomologous  end  joining  can  be  a  risky  strategy  for  fixing 
broken  chromosomes.  So  cells  have  an  alternative,  error-free  strategy 
for  repairing  double-strand  breaks,  called  homologous  recombination 
(Figure 6–29B), as we discuss next.

Homologous recombination can Flawlessly repair dna 
double-Strand Breaks 
The  problem  with  repairing  a  double-strand  break,  as  we  mentioned, 
is finding an intact template to guide the repair. However, if a double-
strand  break  occurs  in  one  double  helix  shortly  after  a  stretch  of  DNA 
has  been  replicated,  the  undamaged  double  helix  can  readily  serve  as 
a  template  to  guide  the  repair  of  the  broken  DNA:  information  on  the 
undamaged strand of the intact double helix is used to repair the com-
plementary broken strand in the other. Because the two DNA molecules 

DNa repair         

217

are homologous—they have identical nucleotide sequences outside the 
broken region—this mechanism is known as homologous recombina-
tion. It results in a flawless repair of the double-strand break, with no loss 
of genetic information (see Figure 6–29B). 

Homologous recombination most often occurs shortly after a cell’s DNA 
has been replicated before cell division, when the duplicated helices are 
still physically close to each other (Figure 6–30A). To initiate the repair, a 
nuclease chews back the 5ʹ ends of the two broken strands at the break 
(Figure 6–30B). Then, with the help of specialized enzymes, one of the 
broken  3ʹ  ends  “invades”  the  unbroken  homologous  DNA  duplex  and 
searches  for  a  complementary  sequence  through  base-pairing  (Figure 
6–30C). Once an extensive, accurate match is found, the invading strand 
is elongated by a repair DNA polymerase, using the complementary strand 
as  a  template  (Figure  6–30D).  After  the  repair  polymerase  has  passed 
the  point  where  the  break  occurred,  the  newly  repaired  strand  rejoins 
its original partner, forming base pairs that hold the two strands of the 
broken double helix together (Figure  6–30e). Repair is then completed 
by additional DNA synthesis at the 3ʹ ends of both strands of the broken 
double  helix  (Figure  6–30F),  followed  by  DNA  ligation  (Figure  6–30G).

ChApteR 6     DNa replication, repair, and recombination

The net result is two intact DNA helices, where the genetic information 
from one was used as a template to repair the other.

Homologous recombination can also be used to repair many other types 
of DNA damage, making it perhaps the most handy DNA repair mech-
anism  available  to  the  cell:  all  that  is  needed  is  an  intact  homologous 
chromosome to use as a partner—a situation that occurs transiently each 
time a chromosome is duplicated. The “all-purpose” nature of homolo-
gous recombinational repair probably explains why this mechanism, and 
the proteins that carry it out, have been conserved in virtually all cells on 
Earth. 

Homologous  recombination  is  versatile,  and  has  a  crucial  role  in  the 
exchange of genetic information during the formation of the germ cells—
sperm and eggs. This specialized process, called meiosis, enhances the 
generation of genetic diversity within a species during sexual reproduc-
tion. We will discuss it when we talk about sex in Chapter 19. 

Failure to repair dna damage can Have Severe 
consequences for a cell or organism 
On occasion, the cell’s DNA replication and repair processes fail and give 
rise to a mutation. This permanent change in the DNA sequence can have 
profound consequences. A mutation that affects just a single nucleotide 
pair can severely compromise an organism’s fitness if the change occurs 
in a vital position in the DNA sequence. Because the structure and activ-
ity of each protein depend on its amino acid sequence, a protein with an 
altered sequence may function poorly or not at all. For example, humans 
use the protein hemoglobin to transport oxygen in the blood (see Figure 
4–24). A permanent change in a single nucleotide in a hemoglobin gene 
can cause cells to make hemoglobin with an incorrect sequence of amino 
acids.  One  such  mutation  causes  the  disease  sickle-cell  anemia.  The 
sickle-cell hemoglobin is less soluble than normal hemoglobin and forms 
fibrous intracellular precipitates, which produce the characteristic sickle 
shape of affected red blood cells (Figure 6–31). Because these cells are 
more fragile and frequently tear as they travel through the bloodstream, 
patients with this potentially life-threatening disease have fewer red blood 
cells than usual—that is, they are anemic. This anemia can cause weak-
ness, dizziness, headaches, and breathlessness. Moreover, the abnormal 
red blood cells can aggregate and block small vessels, causing pain and 
organ failure. We know about sickle-cell hemoglobin because individu-
als with the mutation survive; the mutation even provides a benefit—an 
increased resistance to malaria. Over the course of evolution, many other 
mutations in the hemoglobin gene have arisen, but only those that do not 
completely destroy the protein remain in the population.

The example of sickle-cell anemia, which is an inherited disease, illus-
trates the importance of protecting reproductive cells (germ cells) against 
mutation. A mutation in a germ cell will be passed on to all the cells in 
the body of the multicellular organism that develops from it, including the 
germ cells responsible for the production of the next generation. 

The many other cells in a multicellular organism (its somatic cells) must 
also be protected against mutation—in this case, against mutations that 
arise  during  the  life  of  an  individual.  Nucleotide  changes  that  occur  in 
somatic  cells  can  give  rise  to  variant  cells,  some  of  which  grow  and 
divide in an uncontrolled fashion at the expense of the other cells in the 
organism.  In  the  extreme  case,  an  unchecked  cell  proliferation  known 
as cancer results. Cancers are responsible for about 30% of the deaths 
that occur in Europe and North America, and they are caused largely by 
a  gradual  accumulation  of  random  mutations  in  a  somatic  cell  and  its

Figure 6–31 A single nucleotide change 
causes the disease sickle-cell anemia.  
(a) β-globin is one of the two types of 
protein subunits that form hemoglobin (see 
Figure 4–24). a single nucleotide change 
(mutation) in the β-globin gene produces 
a β-globin subunit that differs from normal 
β-globin only by a change from glutamic 
acid to valine at the sixth amino acid 
position. (Only a small portion of the gene 
is shown here; the β-globin subunit contains 
a total of 146 amino acids.) humans carry 
two copies of each gene (one inherited from 
each parent); a sickle-cell mutation in one of 
the two β-globin genes generally causes no 
harm to the individual, as it is compensated 
for by the normal gene. however, an 
individual who inherits two copies of the 
mutant β-globin gene will have sickle-cell 
anemia. Normal red blood cells are shown 
in (B), and those from an individual suffering 
from sickle-cell anemia in (c). although 
sickle-cell anemia can be a life-threatening 
disease, the mutation responsible can also 
be beneficial. people with the disease, 
or those who carry one normal gene and 
one sickle-cell gene, are more resistant to 
malaria than unaffected individuals, because 
the parasite that causes malaria grows 
poorly in red blood cells that contain the 
sickle-cell form of hemoglobin.

Figure 6–32 Cancer incidence increases dramatically with age. the 
number of newly diagnosed cases of cancer of the colon in women 
in england and Wales in one year is plotted as a function of age at 
diagnosis. colon cancer, like most human cancers, is caused by the 
accumulation of multiple mutations. Because cells are continually 
experiencing accidental changes to their DNa—which accumulate and 
are passed on to progeny cells when the mutated cells divide—the 
chance that a cell will become cancerous increases greatly with age.

descendants (Figure 6–32). Increasing the mutation frequency even two- 
or threefold could cause a disastrous increase in the incidence of cancer 
by accelerating the rate at which such somatic cell variants arise. 

Thus,  the  high  fidelity  with  which  DNA  sequences  are  replicated  and 
maintained is important both for reproductive cells, which transmit the 
genes to the next generation, and for somatic cells, which normally func-
tion as carefully regulated members of the complex community of cells 
in a multicellular organism. We should therefore not be surprised to find 
that all cells possess a very sophisticated set of mechanisms to reduce 
the number of mutations that occur in their DNA, devoting hundreds of 
genes to these repair processes.

a record of the Fidelity of dna replication and repair is 
preserved in Genome Sequences
Although  the  majority  of  mutations  do  neither  harm  nor  good  to  an 
organism, those that have harmful consequences are usually eliminated 
from  the  population  through  natural  selection;  individuals  carrying  the 
altered  DNA  may  die  or  experience  decreased  fertility,  in  which  case 
these  changes  will  be  lost.  By  contrast,  favorable  changes  will  tend  to 
persist and spread. 

But  even  where  no  selection  operates—at  the  many  sites  in  the  DNA 
where a change of nucleotide has no effect on the fitness of the organ-
ism—the  genetic  message  has  been  faithfully  preserved  over  tens  of 
millions of years. Thus humans and chimpanzees, after about 5 million 
years of divergent evolution, still have DNA sequences that are at least 
98% identical. Even humans and whales, after 10 or 20 times this amount 
of time, have chromosomes that are unmistakably similar in their DNA 
sequence, and many proteins have amino acid sequences that are almost 
identical (Figure 6–33). Thus our genome—and those of our relatives—
contains a message from the distant past. Thanks to the faithfulness of 
DNA replication and repair, 100 million years of evolution have scarcely 
changed its essential content.

many of their genes are closely similar. the

•	 Before	a	cell	divides,	it	must	accurately	replicate	the	vast	quantity	of

•	 During	replication,	the	two	strands	of	a	DNA	double	helix	are	pulled

This	accuracy	is	made	possible,	in	part,	by	a	proofreading	process	in	
which	the	enzyme	corrects	its	own	mistakes	as	it	moves	along	the

•	 Because	DNA	polymerase	synthesizes	new	DNA	in	only	one	direction,	
only the leading strand at the replication fork can be synthesized in

a	discontinuous	backstitching	process,	producing	short	fragments	of	
DNA that are later joined together by DNA ligase.

•	 DNA	 polymerase	 is	 incapable	 of	 starting	 a	 new	 DNA	 chain	 from

called	primase,	which	makes	short	lengths	of	RNA	primers	that	are	
then	elongated	by	DNA	polymerase.	These	primers	are	subsequently	
erased	and	replaced	with	DNA.	

•	 DNA	replication	requires	the	cooperation	of	many	proteins	that	form

If	both	DNA	strands	are	broken,	the	double-strand	break	can	be	rap-

From DnA to Protein:
How Cells Read the Genome

Once  the  double-helical  structure  of  DNA  (deoxyribonucleic  acid)  had 
been determined in the early 1950s, it became clear that the hereditary 
information in cells is encoded in the linear order—or sequence—of the 
four  different  nucleotide  subunits  that  make  up  the  DNA.  We  saw  in 
Chapter 6 how this information can be passed on unchanged from a cell 
to its descendants through the process of DNA replication. But how does 
the  cell  decode  and  use  the  information?  How  do  genetic  instructions 
written in an alphabet of just four “letters” direct the formation of a bac-
terium, a fruit fly, or a human? We still have a lot to learn about how the 
information stored in an organism’s genes produces even the simplest 
unicellular bacterium, let alone how it directs the development of com-
plex multicellular organisms like ourselves. But the DNA code itself has 
been deciphered, and we have come a long way in understanding how 
cells read it. 

Even before the DNA code was broken, it was known that the information 
contained in genes somehow directed the synthesis of proteins. Proteins 
are the principal constituents of cells and determine not only cell struc-
ture but also cell function. In previous chapters, we encountered some 
of the thousands of different kinds of proteins that cells can make. We 
saw in Chapter 4 that the properties and function of a protein molecule 
are determined by the sequence of the 20 different amino acid subunits 
in its polypeptide chain: each type of protein has its own unique amino 
acid sequence, which dictates how the chain will fold to form a molecule 
with a distinctive shape and chemistry. The genetic instructions carried 
by DNA must therefore specify the amino acid sequences of proteins. We 
will see in this chapter exactly how this is done.

Figure 7–1 Genetic information directs 
the synthesis of proteins. the flow of 
genetic information from DNa to rNa 
(transcription) and from rNa to protein 
(translation) occurs in all living cells. It 
was Francis crick who dubbed this flow 
of information “the central dogma.” the 
segments of DNa that are transcribed into 
rNa are called genes. 

ECB4 E7.01/7.01

DNA does not synthesize proteins itself, but it acts like a manager, del-
egating the various tasks to a team of workers. When a particular protein 
is needed by the cell, the nucleotide sequence of the appropriate segment 
of a DNA molecule is first copied into another type of nucleic acid—RNA 
(ribonucleic acid ). That segment of DNA is called a gene, and the result-
ing RNA copies are then used to direct the synthesis of the protein. Many 
thousands  of  these  conversions  from  DNA  to  protein  occur  every  sec-
ond in each cell in our body. The flow of genetic information in cells is 
therefore from DNA to RNA to protein (Figure 7–1). All cells, from bacte-
ria to humans, express their genetic information in this way—a principle 
so fundamental that it has been termed the central dogma of molecular 
biology.

In  this  chapter,  we  explain  the  mechanisms  by  which  cells  copy  DNA 
into  RNA  (a  process  called  transcription)  and  then  use  the  information 
in  RNA  to  make  protein  (a  process  called  translation).  We  also  discuss 
a few of the key variations on this basic scheme. Principal among these 
is  RNA  splicing,  a  process  in  eukaryotic  cells  in  which  segments  of  an 
RNA transcript are removed—and the remaining segments stitched back 
together—before the RNA is translated into protein. In the final section, 
we consider how the present scheme of information storage, transcrip-
tion, and translation might have arisen from much simpler systems in the 
earliest stages of cell evolution. 

from DNA to rNA
Transcription and translation are the means by which cells read out, or 
express, the instructions in their genes. Many identical RNA copies can be 
made from the same gene, and each RNA molecule can direct the syn-
thesis of many identical protein molecules. This successive amplification 
enables  cells  to  rapidly  synthesize  large  amounts  of  protein  whenever 
necessary. At the same time, each gene can be transcribed, and its RNA 
translated, at different rates, providing the cell with a way to make vast 
quantities  of  some  proteins  and  tiny  quantities  of  others  (Figure  7–2). 
Moreover, as we discuss in Chapter 8, a cell can change (or regulate) the 
expression of each of its genes according to the needs of the moment. 
In this section, we discuss the production of RNA, the first step in gene 
expression.

QuestioN 7–1

Consider the expression “central 
dogma,” which refers to the flow 
of genetic information from DNA 
to rNA to protein. is the word 
“dogma” appropriate in this 
context?

Figure 7–3 the chemical structure of RnA differs slightly from 
that of DnA. (a) rNa contains the sugar ribose, which differs from 
deoxyribose, the sugar used in DNa, by the presence of an additional 
–Oh group. (B) rNa contains the base uracil, which differs from 
thymine, the equivalent base in DNa, by the absence of a –ch3 group. 
(c) a short length of rNa. the chemical linkage between nucleotides 
in rNa—a phosphodiester bond—is the same as that in DNa.

ribose

portions of DNA sequence Are transcribed into rNA
The  first  step  a  cell  takes  in  expressing  one  of  its  many  thousands  of 
genes is to copy the nucleotide sequence of that gene into RNA. The proc-
ess is called transcription because the information, though copied into 
another chemical form, is still written in essentially the same language—
the  language  of  nucleotides.  Like  DNA,  RNA  is  a  linear  polymer  made 
of four different nucleotide subunits, linked together by phosphodiester 
bonds.  It  differs  from  DNA  chemically  in  two  respects:  (1)  the  nucle-
otides in RNA are ribonucleotides—that is, they contain the sugar ribose 
(hence the name ribonucleic acid) rather than deoxyribose; (2) although, 
like  DNA,  RNA  contains  the  bases  adenine  (A),  guanine  (G),  and  cyto-
sine (C), it contains uracil (U) instead of the thymine (T) found in DNA 
(Figure 7–3). Because U, like T, can base-pair by hydrogen-bonding with 
A (Figure 7–4), the complementary base-pairing properties described for 
DNA in Chapter 5 apply also to RNA.

Although their chemical differences are small, DNA and RNA differ quite 
dramatically  in  overall  structure.  Whereas  DNA  always  occurs  in  cells 
as a double-stranded helix, RNA is single-stranded. This difference has 
important  functional  consequences.  Because  an  RNA  chain  is  single-
stranded,  it  can  fold  up  into  a  variety  of  shapes,  just  as  a  polypeptide 
chain folds up to form the final shape of a protein (Figure 7–5); double-
stranded DNA cannot fold in this fashion. As we discuss later, the ability 
to fold into a complex three-dimensional shape allows RNA to carry out 
various functions in cells, in addition to conveying information between 
DNA and protein. Whereas DNA functions solely as an information store, 
some RNAs have structural, regulatory, or catalytic roles.

Figure 7–5 RnA molecules can form intramolecular base pairs and fold into specific structures. rNa is single-
stranded, but it often contains short stretches of nucleotides that can base-pair with complementary sequences  
found elsewhere on the same molecule. these interactions—along with some “nonconventional base-pair 
interactions (e.g., a-G)—allow an rNa molecule to fold into a three-dimensional structure that is determined by its 
sequence of nucleotides. (a) a diagram of a hypothetical, folded rNa structure showing only conventional (G-c and

Figure 7–6 transcription of a gene 
produces an RnA complementary to one 
strand of DnA. the transcribed strand 
of the gene, the bottom strand in this 
example, is called the template strand.  
the nontemplate strand of the gene  
(here, shown at the top) is sometimes called 
the coding strand because its sequence 
is equivalent to the rNa product, as 
shown. Which DNa strand serves as the 
template varies, depending on the gene, 
as we discuss later. By convention, an rNa 
molecule is always depicted with its  
5′ end—the first part to be synthesized—
to the left.

ECB4 e7.06/7.06

transcription produces rNA that is Complementary to 
one strand of DNA
All the RNA in a cell is made by transcription, a process that has certain 
similarities  to  DNA  replication  (discussed  in  Chapter  6).  Transcription 
begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA 
double helix to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two 
strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a template for the synthe-
sis of RNA. Ribonucleotides are added, one by one, to the growing RNA 
chain; as in DNA replication, the nucleotide sequence of the RNA chain 
is  determined  by  complementary  base-pairing  with  the  DNA  template. 
When a good match is made, the incoming ribonucleotide is covalently 
linked  to  the  growing  RNA  chain  by  the  enzyme  RNA  polymerase.  The 
RNA chain produced by transcription—the RNA transcript—is therefore 
elongated one nucleotide at a time and has a nucleotide sequence exactly 
complementary to the strand of DNA used as the template (Figure 7–6).

Transcription  differs  from  DNA  replication  in  several  crucial  respects. 
Unlike  a  newly  formed  DNA  strand,  the  RNA  strand  does  not  remain 
hydrogen-bonded to the DNA template strand. Instead, just behind the 
region where the ribonucleotides are being added, the RNA chain is dis-
placed and the DNA helix re-forms. For this reason—and because only 
one  strand  of  the  DNA  molecule  is  transcribed—RNA  molecules  are 
single-stranded.  Further,  because  RNAs  are  copied  from  only  a  limited 
region of DNA, RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules; 
DNA molecules in a human chromosome can be up to 250 million nucle-
otide  pairs  long,  whereas  most  mature  RNAs  are  no  more  than  a  few 
thousand nucleotides long, and many are much shorter than that.

Like  the  DNA  polymerase  that  carries  out  DNA  replication  (discussed 
in  Chapter  6),  RNA  polymerases  catalyze  the  formation  of  the  phos-
phodiester  bonds  that  link  the  nucleotides  together  and  form  the 
sugar–phosphate backbone of the RNA chain (see Figure 7–3). The RNA 
polymerase  moves  stepwise  along  the  DNA,  unwinding  the  DNA  helix 
just  ahead  to  expose  a  new  region  of  the  template  strand  for  comple-
mentary base-pairing. In this way, the growing RNA chain is extended by 
one nucleotide at a time in the 5′-to-3′ direction (Figure 7–7). The incom-
ing  ribonucleoside  triphosphates  (ATP,  CTP,  UTP,  and  GTP)  provide  the 
energy needed to drive the reaction forward (see Figure 6–11).

ECB4 e7.07/7.07

The almost immediate release of the RNA strand from the DNA as it is syn-
thesized means that many RNA copies can be made from the same gene 
in a relatively short time; the synthesis of the next RNA is usually started 
before the first RNA has been completed (Figure 7–8). A medium-sized 
gene—say, 1500 nucleotide pairs—requires approximately 50 seconds for 
a molecule of RNA polymerase to transcribe it (Movie 7.2). At any given 
time, there could be dozens of polymerases speeding along this single 
stretch of DNA, hard on one another’s heels, allowing more than 1000 
transcripts to be synthesized in an hour. For most genes, however, the 
amount of transcription is much less than this.

Although RNA polymerase catalyzes essentially the same chemical reac-
tion as DNA polymerase, there are some important differences between 
the two enzymes. First, and most obviously, RNA polymerase uses ribo-
nucleoside  for  phosphates  as  substrates,  so  it  catalyzes  the  linkage  of 
ribonucleotides,  not  deoxyribonucleotides.  Second,  unlike  the  DNA 
polymerase involved in DNA replication, RNA polymerases can start an 
RNA chain without a primer. This difference likely evolved because tran-
scription need not be as accurate as DNA replication; unlike DNA, RNA is 
not used as the permanent storage form of genetic information in cells, 
so mistakes in RNA transcripts have relatively minor consequences for a 
cell. RNA polymerases make about one mistake for every 104 nucleotides 
copied into RNA, whereas DNA polymerase makes only one mistake for 
every 107 nucleotides copied.

Cells produce Various types of rNA 
The vast majority of genes carried in a cell’s DNA specify the amino acid 
sequences of proteins. The RNA molecules encoded by these genes—which

Figure 7–7 DnA is transcribed into RnA 
by the enzyme RnA polymerase. rNa 
polymerase (pale blue) moves stepwise 
along the DNa, unwinding the DNa helix in 
front of it. as it progresses, the polymerase 
adds ribonucleotides one by one to the 
rNa chain, using an exposed DNa strand as 
a template. the resulting rNa transcript is 
thus single-stranded and complementary to 
this template strand (see Figure 7–6). as the 
polymerase moves along the DNa template 
(in the 3′-to-5′ direction), it displaces the 
newly formed rNa, allowing the two strands 
of DNa behind the polymerase to rewind. 
a short region of hybrid DNa/rNa helix 
(approximately nine nucleotides in length) 
therefore forms only transiently, causing a 
“window” of DNa/rNa helix to move along 
the DNa with the polymerase (Movie 7.2).

QuestioN 7–2

in the electron micrograph in figure 
7–8, are the rNA polymerase 
molecules moving from right to left 
or from left to right? Why are the 
rNA transcripts so much shorter 
than the DNA segments (genes) that 
encode them?

Figure 7–8 transcription can be visualized 
in the electron microscope. the 
micrograph shows many molecules of rNa 
polymerase simultaneously transcribing two 
adjacent ribosomal genes on a single DNa 
molecule. Molecules of rNa polymerase 
are barely visible as a series of tiny dots 
along the spine of the DNa molecule; 
each polymerase has an rNa transcript (a 
short, fine thread) radiating from it. the 
rNa molecules being transcribed from the 
two ribosomal genes—ribosomal rNas 
(rrNas)—are not translated into protein, but 
are instead used directly as components of 
ribosomes, macromolecular machines made 
of rNa and protein. the large particles that 
can be seen at the free, 5′ end of each rrNa 
transcript are believed to be ribosomal 
proteins that have assembled on the ends 
of the growing transcripts. (courtesy of 
Ulrich Scheer.)

CHAPteR 7     From DNa to protein: how cells read the Genome

ultimately direct the synthesis of proteins—are called messenger RNAs 
(mRNAs). In eukaryotes, each mRNA typically carries information tran-
scribed from just one gene, which codes for a single protein; in bacteria, a 
set of adjacent genes is often transcribed as a single mRNA, which there-
fore carries the information for several different proteins.

The final product of other genes, however, is the RNA itself. As we see 
later, these nonmessenger RNAs, like proteins, have various roles, serv-
ing as regulatory, structural, and catalytic components of cells. They play 
key parts, for example, in translating the genetic message into protein: 
ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) form the structural and catalytic core of the ribos-
omes, which translate mRNAs into protein, and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) act 
as adaptors that select specific amino acids and hold them in place on a 
ribosome for their incorporation into protein. Other small RNAs, called 
microRNAs (miRNAs), serve as key regulators of eukaryotic gene expres-
sion, as we discuss in Chapter 8. The most common types of RNA are 
summarized in table 7–1.

In the broadest sense, the term gene  expression refers to the process 
by which the information encoded in a DNA sequence is translated into 
a  product  that  has  some  effect  on  a  cell  or  organism.  In  cases  where 
the final product of the gene is a protein, gene expression includes both 
transcription and translation. When an RNA molecule is the gene’s final 
product, however, gene expression does not require translation. 

signals in DNA tell rNA polymerase Where to start and 
finish transcription
The initiation of transcription is an especially critical process because it 
is the main point at which the cell selects which proteins or RNAs are to 
be  produced.  To  begin  transcription,  RNA  polymerase  must  be  able  to 
recognize the start of a gene and bind firmly to the DNA at this site. The 
way in which RNA polymerases recognize the transcription start site of a 
gene  differs  somewhat  between  bacteria  and  eukaryotes.  Because  the 
situation in bacteria is simpler, we describe it first. 

When an RNA polymerase collides randomly with a DNA molecule, the 
enzyme sticks weakly to the double helix and then slides rapidly along its 
length. RNA polymerase latches on tightly only after it has encountered 
a  gene  region  called  a  promoter,  which  contains  a  specific  sequence 
of  nucleotides  that  lies  immediately  upstream  of  the  starting  point  for 
RNA synthesis. Once bound tightly to this sequence, the RNA polymerase 
opens up the double helix immediately in front of the promoter to expose 
the nucleotides on each strand of a short stretch of DNA. One of the two 
exposed DNA strands then acts as a template for complementary base-
pairing  with  incoming  ribonucleoside  triphosphates,  two  of  which  are

Figure 7–9 signals in the nucleotide

(light blue) contains a subunit called sigma 
factor (yellow) that recognizes the promoter 
of a gene (green). Once transcription has 
begun, sigma factor is released, and the 
polymerase moves forward and continues 
synthesizing the rNa. chain elongation 
continues until the polymerase encounters a 
sequence in the gene called the terminator 
(red ). there the enzyme halts and releases 
both the DNa template and the newly 
made rNa transcript. the polymerase then 
reassociates with a free sigma factor and 
searches for another promoter to begin the 
process again.

joined together by the polymerase to begin synthesis of the RNA chain. 
Chain elongation then continues until the enzyme encounters a second 
signal  in  the  DNA,  the  terminator  (or  stop  site),  where  the  polymerase 
halts and releases both the DNA template and the newly made RNA tran-
script  (Figure  7–9).  This  terminator  sequence  is  contained  within  the 
gene and is transcribed into the 3ʹ end of the newly made RNA. 
Because the polymerase must bind tightly before transcription can begin, 
a segment of DNA will be transcribed only if it is preceded by a promoter. 
This ensures that those portions of a DNA molecule that contain a gene 
will be transcribed into RNA. The nucleotide sequences of a typical pro-
moter—and a typical terminator—are presented in Figure 7–10.
In bacteria, it is a subunit of RNA polymerase, the sigma (σ) factor (see 
Figure  7–9),  that  is  primarily  responsible  for  recognizing  the  promoter 
sequence on the DNA. But how can this factor “see” the promoter, given 
that  the  base-pairs  in  question  are  situated  in  the  interior  of  the  DNA 
double helix? It turns out that each base presents unique features to the 
outside of the double helix, allowing the sigma factor to find the promoter 
sequence without having to separate the entwined DNA strands. 

The  next  problem  an  RNA  polymerase  faces  is  determining  which  of 
the two DNA strands to use as a template for transcription: each strand 
has a different nucleotide sequence and would produce a different RNA 
transcript.  The  secret  lies  in  the  structure  of  the  promoter  itself.  Every 
promoter  has  a  certain  polarity:  it  contains  two  different  nucleotide 
sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site that position the RNA 
polymerase, ensuring that it binds to the promoter in only one orientation

the regions transcribed into rNa 
contain the terminator but not the

convention, the sequence of a gene 
is that of the non-template strand, as 
this strand has the same sequence 
as the transcribed rNa (with t 
substituting for U).

Figure 7–11 on an individual 
chromosome, some genes are transcribed 
using one DnA strand as a template, 
and others are transcribed from the 
other DnA strand. rNa polymerase 
always moves in the 3′-to-5′ direction 
and the selection of the template strand 
is determined by the orientation of the 
promoter (green arrowheads) at the 
beginning of each gene. thus the genes 
transcribed from left to right use the bottom 
DNa strand as the template (see Figure 
7–10); those transcribed from right to left 
use the top strand as the template.

(see  Figure  7–10A).  Because  the  polymerase  can  only  synthesize  RNA 
in the 5′-to-3′ direction once the enzyme is bound it must use the DNA 
strand oriented in the 3′-to-5′ direction as its template. 
This selection of a template strand does not mean that on a given chro-
mosome,  transcription  always  proceeds  in  the  same  direction.  With 
respect to the chromosome as a whole, the direction of transcription var-
ies  from  gene  to  gene.  But  because  each  gene  typically  has  only  one 
promoter, the orientation of its promoter determines in which direction 
that gene is transcribed and therefore which strand is the template strand 
(Figure 7–11).

ECB4 e7.10/7.10

initiation of eukaryotic gene transcription is a Complex 
process
Many  of  the  principles  we  just  outlined  for  bacterial  transcription  also 
apply to eukaryotes. However, transcription initiation in eukaryotes dif-
fers in several important ways from that in bacteria: 

•	 The	 first	 difference	 lies	 in	 the	 RNA	 polymerases	 themselves.	 While	
bacteria  contain  a  single  type  of  RNA  polymerase,  eukaryotic  cells 
have three—RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, and RNA polymer-
ase  III.  These  polymerases  are  responsible  for  transcribing  different 
types of genes. RNA polymerases I and III transcribe the genes encod-
ing transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and various other RNAs that play 
structural and catalytic roles in the cell (table 7–2). RNA polymerase 
II transcribes the vast majority of eukaryotic genes, including all those 
that encode proteins and miRNAs (Movie  7.3). Our subsequent dis-
cussion will therefore focus on RNA polymerase II.

•	 A	 second	 difference	 is	 that,	 whereas	 the	 bacterial	 RNA	 polymerase	
(along  with  its  sigma  subunit)  is  able  to  initiate  transcription  on  its 
own, eukaryotic RNA polymerases require the assistance of a large set 
of accessory proteins. Principal among these are the general transcrip-
tion factors, which must assemble at each promoter, along with the 
polymerase, before the polymerase can begin transcription.

•	 A	 third	 distinctive	 feature	 of	 transcription	 in	 eukaryotes	 is	 that	 the	
mechanisms that control its initiation are much more elaborate than 
those in prokaryotes—a point we discuss in detail in Chapter 8. In bac-
teria, genes tend to lie very close to one another in the DNA, with only 
very short lengths of nontranscribed DNA between them. But in plants 
and animals, including humans, individual genes are spread out along 
the DNA, with stretches of up to 100,000 nucleotide pairs between one 
gene and the next. This architecture allows a single gene to be con-
trolled by a large variety of regulatory DNA sequences scattered along 
the DNA, and it enables eukaryotes to engage in more complex forms 
of transcriptional regulation than do bacteria.

•	 Last	 but	 not	 least,	 eukaryotic	 transcription	 initiation	 must	 take	 into	
account  the  packing  of  DNA  into  nucleosomes  and  more  compact 
forms of chromatin structure, as we describe in Chapter 8. 

We now turn to the general transcription factors and discuss how they 
help eukaryotic RNA polymerase II initiate transcription. 

eukaryotic rNA polymerase requires general 
transcription factors
The initial finding that, unlike bacterial RNA polymerase, purified eukary-
otic  RNA  polymerase  II  could  not  initiate  transcription  on  its  own  in  a 
test tube led to the discovery and purification of the general transcrip-
tion factors. These accessory proteins assemble on the promoter, where 
they position the RNA polymerase and pull apart the DNA double helix 
to  expose  the  template  strand,  allowing  the  polymerase  to  begin  tran-
scription.  Thus  the  general  transcription  factors  have  a  similar  role  in 
eukaryotic transcription as sigma factor has in bacterial transcription.
Figure  7–12  shows  how  the  general  transcription  factors  assemble  at 
a promoter used by RNA polymerase II. The assembly process typically 
begins with the binding of the general transcription factor TFIID to a short 

Figure 7–12 to begin transcription, eukaryotic RnA polymerase ii 
requires a set of general transcription factors. these transcription 
factors are called tFIIB, tFIID, and so on. (a) Many eukaryotic 
promoters contain a DNa sequence called the tata box. (B) the 
tata box is recognized by a subunit of the general transcription factor 
tFIID, called the tata-binding protein (tBp). For simplicity, the DNa 
distortion produced by the binding of the tBp (see Figure 7–13) is 
not shown. (c) the binding of tFIID enables the adjacent binding of 
tFIIB. (D) the rest of the general transcription factors, as well as the 
rNa polymerase itself, assemble at the promoter. (e) tFIIh then pries 
apart the double helix at the transcription start point, using the energy 
of atp hydrolysis, which exposes the template strand of the gene (not 
shown). tFIIh also phosphorylates rNa polymerase II, releasing the 
polymerase from most of the general transcription factors, so it can 
begin transcription. the site of phosphorylation is a long polypeptide 
“tail” that extends from the polymerase.

Figure 7–13 tAtA-binding protein (tbP) binds to the tAtA box 
(indicated by letters) and bends the DnA double helix. the unique 
distortion of DNa caused by tBp, which is a subunit of tFIID (see 
Figure 7–12), helps attract the other general transcription factors. 
tBp is a single polypeptide chain that is folded into two very similar 
domains (blue and green). the protein sits atop the DNa double helix 
like a saddle on a bucking horse (Movie 7.4). (adapted from J.L. Kim 
et al., Nature 365:520–527, 1993. With permission from Macmillan 
publishers Ltd.)

segment of DNA double helix composed primarily of T and A nucleotides; 
because of its composition, this part of the promoter is known as the TATA 
box. Upon binding to DNA, TFIID causes a dramatic local distortion in the 
DNA double helix (Figure 7–13), which helps to serve as a landmark for 
the subsequent assembly of other proteins at the promoter. The TATA box 
is a key component of many promoters used by RNA polymerase II, and 
it is typically located 25 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start 
site. Once TFIID has bound to the TATA box, the other factors assemble, 
along with RNA polymerase II, to form a complete transcription initiation 
complex.  Although  Figure  7–12  shows  the  general  transcription  factors 
piling onto the promoter in a certain order, the actual order of assembly 
probably differs from one promoter to the next.

After RNA polymerase II has been positioned on the promoter, it must be 
released from the complex of general transcription factors to begin its task 
of making an RNA molecule. A key step in liberating the RNA polymer-
ase is the addition of phosphate groups to its “tail” (see Figure 7–12E). 
This liberation is initiated by the general transcription factor TFIIH, which 
contains a protein kinase as one of its subunits. Once transcription has 
begun, most of the general transcription factors dissociate from the DNA 
and then are available to initiate another round of transcription with a 
new RNA polymerase molecule. When RNA polymerase II finishes tran-
scribing a gene, it too is released from the DNA; the phosphates on its 
tail are stripped off by protein phosphatases, and the polymerase is then 
ready to find a new promoter. Only the dephosphorylated form of RNA 
polymerase II can initiate RNA synthesis.

eukaryotic mrNAs Are processed in the Nucleus
Although the templating principle by which DNA is transcribed into RNA 
is the same in all organisms, the way in which the RNA transcripts are 
handled before they can be used by the cell to make protein differs greatly 
between  bacteria  and  eukaryotes.  Bacterial  DNA  lies  directly  exposed 
to  the  cytoplasm,  which  contains  the  ribosomes  on  which  protein  syn-
thesis  takes  place.  As  an  mRNA  molecule  in  a  bacterium  starts  to  be 
synthesized, ribosomes immediately attach to the free 5′ end of the RNA 
transcript and begin translating it into protein. 

In  eukaryotic  cells,  by  contrast,  DNA  is  enclosed  within  the  nucleus. 
Transcription  takes  place  in  the  nucleus,  but  protein  synthesis  takes 
place  on  ribosomes  in  the  cytoplasm.  So,  before  a  eukaryotic  mRNA 
can be translated into protein, it must be transported out of the nucleus 
through small pores in the nuclear envelope (Figure 7–14). Before it can 
be exported to the cytosol, however, a eukaryotic RNA must go through 
several RNA processing steps, which include capping, splicing, and poly-
adenylation, as we discuss shortly. These steps take place as the RNA is 
being synthesized. The enzymes responsible for RNA processing ride on 
the phosphorylated tail of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II as it synthesizes 
an RNA molecule (see Figure 7–12), and they process the transcript as it 
emerges from the polymerase (Figure 7–15).

Different types of RNA are processed in different ways before leaving the 
nucleus. Two processing steps, capping and polyadenylation, occur only 
on RNA transcripts destined to become mRNA molecules (called precur-
sor mRNAs, or pre-mRNAs).
1.  RNA capping modifies the 5′ end of the RNA transcript, the end that 
is synthesized first. The RNA is capped by the addition of an atypical 
nucleotide—a guanine (G) nucleotide bearing a methyl group, which 
is attached to the 5′ end of the RNA in an unusual way (Figure 7–16). 
This capping occurs after RNA polymerase II has produced about 25 
nucleotides  of  RNA,  long  before  it  has  completed  transcribing  the 
whole gene.

2.  Polyadenylation  provides  a  newly  transcribed  mRNA  with  a  spe-
cial structure at its 3′ end. In contrast with bacteria, where the 3′ end 
of an mRNA is simply the end of the chain synthesized by the RNA 
polymerase, the 3′ end of a forming eukaryotic mRNA is first trimmed 
by  an  enzyme  that  cuts  the  RNA  chain  at  a  particular  sequence  of 
nucleotides.  The  transcript  is  then  finished  off  by  a  second  enzyme 
that adds a series of repeated adenine (A) nucleotides to the cut end. 
This poly-A tail is generally a few hundred nucleotides long (see Figure 
7–16A).

These  two  modifications—capping  and  polyadenylation—increase  the 
stability  of  a  eukaryotic  mRNA  molecule,  facilitate  its  export  from  the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm, and generally mark the RNA molecule as an 
mRNA. They are also used by the protein-synthesis machinery to make 
sure  that  both  ends  of  the  mRNA  are  present  and  that  the  message  is 
therefore complete before protein synthesis begins. 

in eukaryotes, protein-Coding genes Are interrupted by 
Noncoding sequences Called introns
Most  eukaryotic  pre-mRNAs  have  to  undergo  an  additional  processing 
step  before  they  are  functional  mRNAs.  This  step  involves  a  far  more 
radical  modification  of  the  pre-mRNA  transcript  than  capping  or  poly-
adenylation,  and  it  is  the  consequence  of  a  surprising  feature  of  most 
eukaryotic genes. In bacteria, most proteins are encoded by an uninter-
rupted stretch of DNA sequence that is transcribed into an mRNA that, 
without any further processing, can be translated into protein. Most pro-
tein-coding eukaryotic genes, in contrast, have their coding sequences 
interrupted  by  long,  noncoding,  intervening  sequences  called  introns. 
The scattered pieces of coding sequence—called expressed sequences or

Figure 7–17 eukaryotic and bacterial genes are organized differently. a bacterial 
gene consists of a single stretch of uninterrupted nucleotide sequence that encodes 
the amino acid sequence of a protein (or more than one protein). In contrast, the 
protein-coding sequences of most eukaryotic genes (exons) are interrupted by 
noncoding sequences (introns). promoters for transcription are indicated in green.

ECB4 E7.17/7.17

exons—are  usually  shorter  than  the  introns,  and  they  often  represent 
only a small fraction of the total length of the gene (Figure 7–17). Introns 
range in length from a single nucleotide to more than 10,000 nucleotides. 
Some protein-coding eukaryotic genes lack introns altogether, and some 
have only a few; but most have many (Figure 7–18). Note that the terms 
“exon” and “intron” apply to both the DNA and the corresponding RNA 
sequences. 

introns Are removed from pre-mrNAs by rNA splicing
To produce an mRNA in a eukaryotic cell, the entire length of the gene, 
introns as well as exons, is transcribed into RNA. After capping, and as 
RNA polymerase II continues to transcribe the gene, the process of RNA 
splicing begins, in which the introns are removed from the newly synthe-
sized RNA and the exons are stitched together. Each transcript ultimately 
receives a poly-A tail; in some cases, this happens after splicing, whereas 
in  other  cases,  it  occurs  before  the  final  splicing  reactions  have  been 
completed. Once a transcript has been spliced and its 5′ and 3′ ends have 
been  modified,  the  RNA  is  now  a  functional  mRNA  molecule  that  can 
leave the nucleus and be translated into protein.

How does the cell determine which parts of the RNA transcript to remove 
during  splicing?  Unlike  the  coding  sequence  of  an  exon,  most  of  the 
nucleotide sequence of an intron is unimportant. Although there is lit-
tle  overall  resemblance  between  the  nucleotide  sequences  of  different 
introns, each intron contains a few short nucleotide sequences that act 
as cues for its removal from the pre-mRNA. These special sequences are 
found at or near each end of the intron and are the same or very similar in 
all introns (Figure 7–19). Guided by these sequences, an elaborate splic-
ing machine cuts out the intron in the form of a “lariat” structure (Figure 
7–20), formed by the reaction of the “A” nucleotide highlighted in red in 
Figures 7–19 and 7–20.

Figure 7–19 special nucleotide sequences in a pre-mRnA transcript signal the 
beginning and the end of an intron. Only the nucleotide sequences shown are 
required to remove an intron; the other positions in an intron can be occupied by 
any nucleotide. the special sequences are recognized primarily by small nuclear 
ribonucleoproteins (snrNps), which direct the cleavage of the rNa at the intron–
exon borders and catalyze the covalent linkage of the exon sequences. here, in 
addition to the standard symbols for nucleotides (a, c, G, U), r stands for either a 
or G; Y stands for either c or U; N stands for any nucleotide. the a shown in red 
forms the branch point of the lariat produced in the splicing reaction shown in Figure 
7–20. the distances along the rNa between the three splicing sequences are highly 
variable; however, the distance between the branch point and the 5′ splice junction is 
typically much longer than that between the 3′ splice junction and the branch point 
(see Figure 7–20). the splicing sequences shown are from humans; similar sequences 
direct rNa splicing in other eukaryotes.

ECB4 e7.19/7.19

We will not describe the splicing machinery in detail, but it is worthwhile 
to  note  that,  unlike  the  other  steps  of  mRNA  production  we  have  dis-
cussed, RNA splicing is carried out largely by RNA molecules rather than 
proteins. These RNA molecules, called small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), 
are packaged with additional proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleo-
proteins (snRNPs, pronounced “snurps”). The snRNPs recognize splice-site 
sequences  through  complementary  base-pairing  between  their  RNA 
components and the sequences in the pre-mRNA, and they also partici-
pate intimately in the chemistry of splicing (Figure 7–21). Together, these 
snRNPs form the core of the spliceosome, the large assembly of RNA and 
protein molecules that carries out RNA splicing in the nucleus. To watch 
the spliceosome in action, see Movie 7.5.

The  intron–exon  type  of  gene  arrangement  in  eukaryotes  may,  at  first, 
seem wasteful. It does, however, have a number of important benefits. 
First, the transcripts of many eukaryotic genes can be spliced in differ-
ent ways, each of which can produce a distinct protein. Such alternative 
splicing  thereby  allows  many  different  proteins  to  be  produced  from 
the same gene (Figure 7–22). About 95% of human genes are thought to 
undergo  alternative  splicing.  Thus  RNA  splicing  enables  eukaryotes  to 
increase the already enormous coding potential of their genomes.

RNA splicing also provides another advantage to eukaryotes, one that is 
likely to have been profoundly important in the early evolutionary history 
of genes. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 9, the intron–exon structure 
of genes is thought to have sped up the emergence of new and useful 
proteins: novel proteins appear to have arisen by the mixing and match-
ing of different exons of preexisting genes, much like the assembly of a 
new  type  of  machine  from  a  kit  of  preexisting  functional  components. 
Indeed,  many  proteins  in  present-day  cells  resemble  patchworks  com-
posed from a common set of protein pieces, called protein domains (see 
Figure 4–51).

Figure 7–20 An intron in a pre-mRnA 
molecule forms a branched structure 
during RnA splicing. In the first step, the 
branch point adenine (red a) in the intron 
sequence attacks the 5′ splice site and cuts 
the sugar–phosphate backbone of the rNa 
at this point (this is the same a highlighted 
in red in Figure 7–19). In this process, the 
cut 5′ end of the intron becomes covalently 
linked to the 2′-Oh group of the ribose 
of the a nucleotide to form a branched 
structure. the free 3′-Oh end of the exon 
sequence then reacts with the start of 
the next exon sequence, joining the two 
exons together into a continuous coding 
sequence and releasing the intron in the 
form of a lariat structure, which is eventually 
degraded in the nucleus. 

Figure 7–21 splicing is carried out by 
a collection of RnA–protein complexes 
called snRnPs. there are five snrNps, 
called U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. as shown 
here, U1 and U2 bind to the 5′ splice site 
(U1) and the lariat branch point (U2) through 
complementary base-pairing. additional 
snrNps are attracted to the splice site, 
and interactions between their protein 
components drive the assembly of the 
complete spliceosome. rearrangements 
in the base pairs that hold together the 
snrNps and the rNa transcript then 
reorganize the spliceosome to form the 
active site that excises the intron,  
leaving the spliced mrNa behind

mature eukaryotic mrNAs Are exported from the Nucleus
We have seen how eukaryotic pre-mRNA synthesis and processing take 
place in an orderly fashion within the cell nucleus. However, these events 
create a special problem for eukaryotic cells: of the total number of pre-
mRNA transcripts that are synthesized, only a small fraction—the mature 
mRNAs—will  be  useful  to  the  cell.  The  remaining  RNA  fragments—
excised introns, broken RNAs, and aberrantly spliced transcripts—are not 
only useless, but they could be dangerous to the cell if allowed to leave 
the nucleus. How, then, does the cell distinguish between the relatively 
rare mature mRNA molecules it needs to export to the cytosol and the 
overwhelming amount of debris generated by RNA processing? 

The  answer  is  that  the  transport  of  mRNA  from  the  nucleus  to  the 
cytosol,  where  mRNAs  are  translated  into  protein,  is  highly  selective: 
only  correctly  processed  mRNAs  are  exported.  This  selective  transport 
is mediated by nuclear pore complexes, which connect the nucleoplasm 
with the cytosol and act as gates that control which macromolecules can 
enter or leave the nucleus (discussed in Chapter 15). To be “export ready,” 
an mRNA molecule must be bound to an appropriate set of proteins, each 
of which recognizes different parts of a mature mRNA molecule. These 
proteins  include  poly-A–binding  proteins,  a  cap-binding  complex,  and

as indicated on the left, the cap and

are “marked” by proteins that recognize 
these modifications. In addition, a group of 
proteins called the exon junction complex 
is deposited on the pre-mrNa after each 
successful splice has occurred. Once the 
mrNa is deemed “export ready,” a nuclear 
transport receptor (discussed in chapter 
15) associates with the mrNa and guides it 
through the nuclear pore. In the cytosol, the 
mrNa can shed some of these proteins and 
bind new ones, which, along with poly-a–
binding protein, act as initiation factors for 
protein synthesis, as we discuss later.

proteins that bind to mRNAs that have been appropriately spliced (Figure 
7–23). The entire set of bound proteins, rather than any single protein, 
ultimately determines whether an mRNA molecule will leave the nucleus. 
The “waste RNAs” that remain behind in the nucleus are degraded there, 
and their nucleotide building blocks are reused for transcription.

ECB4 e7.22/7.23

mrNA molecules Are eventually Degraded in the Cytosol
Because  a  single  mRNA  molecule  can  be  translated  into  protein  many 
times  (see  Figure  7–2),  the  length  of  time  that  a  mature  mRNA  mole-
cule persists in the cell affects the amount of protein it produces. Each 
mRNA molecule is eventually degraded into nucleotides by ribonucleases 
(RNAses) present in the cytosol, but the lifetimes of mRNA molecules dif-
fer  considerably—depending  on  the  nucleotide  sequence  of  the  mRNA 
and the type of cell. In bacteria, most mRNAs are degraded rapidly, hav-
ing a typical lifetime of about 3 minutes. The mRNAs in eukaryotic cells 
usually persist longer: some, such as those encoding β-globin, have life-
times of more than 10 hours, whereas others have lifetimes of less than 
30 minutes. 

These different lifetimes are in part controlled by nucleotide sequences 
in the mRNA itself, most often in the portion of RNA called the 3′ untrans-
lated region, which lies between the 3′ end of the coding sequence and 
the poly-A tail. The different lifetimes of mRNAs help the cell control the 
amount of each protein that it synthesizes. In general, proteins made in 
large amounts, such as β-globin, are translated from mRNAs that have 
long lifetimes, whereas proteins made in smaller amounts, or whose lev-
els must change rapidly in response to signals, are typically synthesized 
from short-lived mRNAs. 

the earliest Cells may have had introns in their genes
The process of transcription is universal: all cells use RNA polymerase 
and complementary base-pairing to synthesize RNA from DNA. Indeed, 
bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases are almost identical in overall 
structure and clearly evolved from a shared ancestral polymerase. It may 
therefore seem puzzling that the resulting RNA transcripts are handled so 
differently in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes (Figure 7–24). In particular, 
RNA splicing seems to mark a fundamental difference between those two 
types of cells. But how did this dramatic difference arise?

As  we  have  seen,  RNA  splicing  provides  eukaryotes  with  the  ability  to 
produce  a  variety  of  proteins  from  a  single  gene.  It  also  allows  them 
to  evolve  new  genes  by  mixing-and-matching  exons  from  preexisting 
genes, as we discuss in Chapter 9. However, these advantages come with 
a  cost:  the  cell  has  to  maintain  a  larger  genome  and  has  to  discard  a

Figure 7–24 Prokaryotes and eukaryotes 
handle their RnA transcripts differently. 
(a) In eukaryotic cells, the pre-mrNa 
molecule produced by transcription 
contains both intron and exon sequences. 
Its two ends are modified, and the introns 
are removed by rNa splicing. the resulting 
mrNa is then transported from the nucleus 
to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into 
protein. although these steps are depicted 
as occurring in sequence, one at a time, 
in reality they occur simultaneously. For 
example, the rNa cap is usually added and 
splicing usually begins before transcription 
has been completed. Because of this 
overlap, transcripts of the entire gene 
(including all introns and exons) do not 
typically exist in the cell. (B) In prokaryotes, 
the production of mrNa molecules 
is simpler. the 5′ end of an mrNa 
molecule is produced by the initiation of 
transcription by rNa polymerase, and the 
3′ end is produced by the termination of 
transcription. Because prokaryotic cells 
lack a nucleus, transcription and translation 
take place in a common compartment. 
translation of a bacterial mrNa can 
therefore begin before its synthesis has 
been completed. In both eukaryotes and 
prokaryotes, the amount of a protein in a 
cell depends on the rates of each of these 
steps, as well as on the rates of degradation 
of the mrNa and protein molecules.

large fraction of the RNA it synthesizes without ever using it. According 
to one school of thought, early cells—the common ancestors of prokary-
otes  and  eukaryotes—contained  introns  that  were  lost  in  prokaryotes 
during subsequent evolution. By shedding their introns and adopting a 
smaller, more streamlined genome, prokaryotes would have been able to 
reproduce more rapidly and efficiently. Consistent with this idea, simple 
eukaryotes that reproduce rapidly (some yeasts, for example) have rela-
tively few introns, and these introns are usually much shorter than those 
found in higher eukaryotes. 

ECB4 e7.23/7.24

On  the  other  hand,  some  argue  that  introns  were  originally  parasitic 
mobile  genetic  elements  (discussed  in  Chapter  9)  that  happened  to 
invade an early eukaryotic ancestor, colonizing its genome. These host 
cells  then  unwittingly  replicated  the  “stowaway”  nucleotide  sequences 
along  with  their  own  DNA;  modern  eukaryotes  simply  never  bothered 
to  sweep  away  the  genetic  clutter  left  from  that  ancient  infection.  The 
issue, however, is far from settled; whether introns evolved early—and 
were lost in prokaryotes—or evolved later in eukaryotes is still a topic of 
scientific debate, and we return to it in Chapter 9.

from rNA to proteiN
By the end of the 1950s, biologists had demonstrated that the informa-
tion encoded in DNA is copied first into RNA and then into protein. The 
debate then shifted to the “coding problem”: How is the information in 
a linear sequence of nucleotides in an RNA molecule translated into the 
linear sequence of a chemically quite different set of subunits—the amino 
acids  in  a  protein?  This  fascinating  question  intrigued  scientists  at  the 
time.  Here  was  a  cryptogram  set  up  by  nature  that,  after  more  than  3 
billion years of evolution, could finally be solved by one of the products 
of  evolution—human  beings!  Indeed,  scientists  have  not  only  cracked 
the code but have revealed, in atomic detail, the precise workings of the 
machinery by which cells read this code.

From rNa to protein         

239

Figure 7–25 the nucleotide sequence of an mRnA is translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein via the genetic code. 
all the three-nucleotide codons in mrNas that specify a given amino acid are listed above that amino acid, which is given in both its 
three-letter and one-letter abbreviations (see panel 2–5, pp. 74–75, for the full name of each amino acid and its structure). Like rNa 
molecules, codons are always written with the 5′-terminal nucleotide to the left. Note that most amino acids are represented by more 
than one codon, and there are some regularities in the set of codons that specify each amino acid. codons for the same amino acid tend 
to contain the same nucleotides at the first and second positions and to vary at the third position. there are three codons that do not 
specify any amino acid but act as termination sites (stop codons), signaling the end of the protein-coding sequence in an mrNa. One 
codon—aUG—acts both as an initiation codon, signaling the start of a protein-coding message, and as the codon that specifies the 
ECB4 e7.24/7.25
amino acid methionine.
An mrNA sequence is Decoded in sets of three 
Nucleotides
Transcription as a means of information transfer is simple to understand: 
DNA and RNA are chemically and structurally similar, and DNA can act as 
a direct template for the synthesis of RNA through complementary base-
pairing. As the term transcription signifies, it is as if a message written 
out by hand were being converted, say, into a typewritten text. The lan-
guage itself and the form of the message do not change, and the symbols 
used are closely related. 
In contrast, the conversion of the information in RNA into protein rep-
resents  a  translation  of  the  information  into  another  language  that 
uses different symbols. Because there are only 4 different nucleotides in 
mRNA but 20 different types of amino acids in a protein, this translation 
cannot be accounted for by a direct one-to-one correspondence between 
a nucleotide in RNA and an amino acid in protein. The rules by which the 
nucleotide sequence of a gene, through an intermediary mRNA molecule, 
is translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein are known as the 
genetic code. 
In 1961, it was discovered that the sequence of nucleotides in an mRNA 
molecule is read consecutively in groups of three. And because RNA is 
made of 4 different nucleotides, there are 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 possible combi-
nations of three nucleotides: AAA, AUA, AUG, and so on. However, only 
20 different amino acids are commonly found in proteins. Either some 
nucleotide triplets are never used, or the code is redundant, with some 
amino acids being specified by more than one triplet. The second pos-
sibility turned out to be correct, as shown by the completely deciphered 
genetic  code  shown  in  Figure  7–25.  Each  group  of  three  consecutive 
nucleotides  in  RNA  is  called  a  codon,  and  each  codon  specifies  one 
amino acid. The strategy by which this code was cracked is described in 
How We know, pp. 240–241.
The  same  genetic  code  is  used  in  nearly  all  present-day  organisms. 
Although a few slight differences have been found, these occur chiefly in 
the mRNA of mitochondria and of some fungi and protozoa. Mitochondria 
have  their  own  DNA  replication,  transcription,  and  protein-synthe-
sis  machinery,  which  operates  independently  from  the  corresponding 
machinery in the rest of the cell (discussed in Chapter 14), and they have 
been  able  to  accommodate  minor  changes  to  the  otherwise  universal 
genetic code. Even in fungi and protozoa, the similarities in the code far 
outweigh the differences. 
In principle, an mRNA sequence can be translated in any one of three dif-
ferent reading frames, depending on where the decoding process begins 
(Figure  7–26).  However,  only  one  of  the  three  possible  reading  frames 

Figure 7–26 in principle, an mRnA 
molecule can be translated in three 
possible reading frames. In the process of 
translating a nucleotide sequence (blue) into 
an amino acid sequence (red), the sequence 
of nucleotides in an mrNa molecule is read 
from the 5′ to the 3′ end in sequential sets 
of three nucleotides. In principle, therefore, 
the same mrNa sequence can specify three 
completely different amino acid sequences, 
depending on where translation begins—
that is, on the reading frame used. In reality, 
however, only one of these reading frames 
encodes the actual message and is therefore 
used in translation, as we discuss later.

CRACkinG tHe GenetiC CoDe

By the beginning of the 1960s, the central dogma had 
been  accepted  as  the  pathway  along  which  informa-
tion flows from gene to protein. It was clear that genes 
encode proteins, that genes are made of DNA, and that 
mRNA  serves  as  an  intermediary,  carrying  the  infor-
mation  from  DNA  to  the  ribosome,  where  the  RNA  is 
translated into protein. 

Even the general format of the genetic code had been 
worked out: each of the 20 amino acids found in pro-
teins  is  represented  by  a  triplet  codon  in  an  mRNA 
molecule.  But  an  even  greater  challenge  remained: 
biologists, chemists, and even physicists set their sights 
on breaking the genetic code—attempting to figure out 
which amino acid each of the 64 possible nucleotide tri-
plets designates. The most straightforward path to the 
solution would have been to compare the sequence of 
a segment of DNA or of mRNA with its corresponding 
polypeptide product. Techniques for sequencing nucleic 
acids,  however,  would  not  be  devised  for  another  10 
years. 

So researchers decided that, to crack the genetic code, 
they  would  have  to  synthesize  their  own  simple  RNA 
molecules. If they could feed these RNA molecules to 
ribosomes—the  machines  that  make  proteins—and 
then  analyze  the  resulting  polypeptide  product,  they 
would  be  on  their  way  to  deciphering  which  triplets 
encode which amino acids.

losing the cells
Before  researchers  could  test  their  synthetic  mRNAs, 
they  needed  to  perfect  a  cell-free  system  for  protein 
synthesis.  This  would  allow  them  to  translate  their 
messages  into  polypeptides  in  a  test  tube.  (Generally 
speaking, when working in the laboratory, the simpler 
the system, the easier it is to interpret the results.) To 
isolate the molecular machinery they needed for such 
a cell-free translation system, researchers broke open 
E. coli cells and loaded their contents into a centrifuge 
tube. Spinning these samples at high speed caused the 
membranes and other large chunks of cellular debris to 
be dragged to the bottom of the tube; the lighter cellular 
components  required  for  protein  synthesis—including 
mRNA,  the  tRNA  adaptors,  ribosomes,  enzymes,  and 
other small molecules—were left floating in the superna-
tant. Researchers found that simply adding radioactive 
amino acids to this cell “soup” would trigger the produc-
tion  of  radiolabeled  polypeptides.  By  centrifuging  this 
supernatant  again,  at  a  higher  speed,  the  researchers 
could force the ribosomes, and any newly synthesized 
peptides attached to them, to the bottom of the tube; the 
labeled polypeptides could then be detected by measur-
ing  the  radioactivity  in  the  sediment  remaining  in  the 
tube after the top layer had been discarded.

The  trouble  with  this  particular  system  was  that  it 
produced  proteins  encoded  by  the  cell’s  own  mRNAs 
already present in the extract. But researchers wanted 
to  use  their  own  synthetic  messages  to  direct  protein 
synthesis.  This  problem  was  solved  when  Marshall 
Nirenberg  discovered  that  he  could  destroy  the  cells’ 
mRNA in the extract by adding a small amount of ribo-
nuclease—an enzyme that degrades RNA—to the mix. 
Now all he needed to do was prepare large quantities of 
synthetic mRNA, add it to the cell-free system, and see 
what peptides came out.

faking the message
Producing  a  synthetic  polynucleotide  with  a  defined 
sequence  was  not  as  simple  as  it  sounds.  Again,  it 
would be years before chemists and bioengineers devel-
oped machines that could synthesize any given string 
of nucleic acids quickly and cheaply. Nirenberg decided 
to  use  polynucleotide  phosphorylase,  an  enzyme  that 
would join ribonucleotides together in the absence of a 
template. The sequence of the resulting RNA would then 
depend entirely on which nucleotides were presented 
to the enzyme. A mixture of nucleotides would be sewn 
into a random sequence; but a single type of nucleotide 
would  yield  a  homogeneous  polymer  containing  only 
that one nucleotide. Thus Nirenberg, working with his 
collaborator Heinrich Matthaei, first produced synthetic 
mRNAs made entirely of uracil—poly U.

Together, the researchers fed this poly U to their cell-
free translation system. They then added a single type 
of  radioactively  labeled  amino  acid  to  the  mix.  After 
testing  each  amino  acid—one  at  a  time,  in  20  differ-
ent  experiments—they  determined  that  poly  U  directs 
the synthesis of a polypeptide containing only phenyl-
alanine (Figure 7–27). With this electrifying result, the 
first word in the genetic code had been deciphered (see 
Figure 7–25). 

Nirenberg and Matthaei then repeated the experiment 
with poly A and poly C and determined that AAA codes 
for lysine and CCC for proline. The meaning of poly G 
could not be ascertained by this method because this 
polynucleotide forms an odd triple-stranded helix that 
did not serve as a template in the cell-free system.

Feeding  ribosomes  with  synthetic  RNA  seemed  a 
fruitful  technique.  But  with  the  single-nucleotide  pos-
sibilities exhausted, researchers had nailed down only 
three codons; they had 61 still to go. The other codons, 
however, were harder to decipher, and a new synthetic 
approach was needed. In the 1950s, the organic chem-
ist Gobind Khorana had been developing methods for 
preparing mixed polynucleotides of defined sequence—
but  his  techniques  worked  only  for  DNA.  When  he

learned  of  Nirenberg’s  work  with  synthetic  RNAs, 
Khorana  directed  his  energies  and  skills  to  producing 
polyribonucleotides. He found that if he started out by 
making DNAs of a defined sequence, he could then use 
RNA  polymerase  to  produce  RNAs  from  those.  In  this 
way,  Khorana  prepared  a  collection  of  different  RNAs 
of defined repeating sequence: he generated sequences 
of repeating dinucleotides (such as poly UC), trinucleo-
tides  (such  as  poly  UUC),  or  tetranucleotides  (such  as 
poly UAUC). 

ECB4 e7.26/7.27

These mixed polynucleotides, however, yielded results 
that were much more difficult to decode than the mono-
nucleotide messages that Nirenberg had used. Take poly 
UG,  for  example.  When  this  repeating  dinucleotide  is 
added to the translation system, researchers discovered 
that it codes for a polypeptide of alternating cysteines 
and valines. This RNA, of course, contains two differ-
ent alternating codons: UGU and GUG. So researchers 
could  say  that  UGU  and  GUG  code  for  cysteine  and 
valine,  although  they  could  not  tell  which  went  with 
which.  Thus  these  mixed  messages  provided  useful 
information, but they did not definitively reveal which 
codons specified which amino acids (Figure 7–28).

trapping the triplets
These final ambiguities in the code were resolved when 
Nirenberg  and  a  young  medical  graduate  named  Phil 
Leder  discovered  that  RNA  fragments  that  were  only 
three nucleotides in length—the size of a single codon—
could  bind  to  a  ribosome  and  attract  the  appropriate 
amino-acid-containing  tRNA  molecule  to  the  protein-
making  machinery.  These  complexes—containing  one 
ribosome,  one  mRNA  codon,  and  one  radiolabeled 
aminoacyl-tRNA—could then be captured on a piece of 
filter paper and the attached amino acid identified. 

Their  trial  run  with  UUU—the  first  word—worked 
splendidly. Leder and Nirenberg primed the usual cell-
free  translation  system  with  snippets  of  UUU.  These 

trinucleotides bound to the ribosomes, and Phe-tRNAs 
bound to the UUU. The new system was up and running, 
and the researchers had confirmed that UUU codes for 
phenylalanine.

All that remained was for researchers to produce all 64 
possible codons—a task that was quickly accomplished 
in both Nirenberg’s and Khorana’s laboratories. Because 
these  small  trinucleotides  were  much  simpler  to  syn-
thesize  chemically,  and  the  triplet-trapping  tests  were 
easier to perform and analyze than the previous decod-
ing experiments, the researchers were able to work out 
the complete genetic code within the next year.

Figure 7–28 Using synthetic RnAs of mixed, repeating 
ribonucleotide sequences, scientists further narrowed 
the coding possibilities. although these mixed messages 
produced mixed polypeptides, they did not permit the 
unambiguous assignment of a single codon to a specific amino 
acid. For example, the results of the poly-UG experiment 
cannot distinguish whether UGU or GUG encodes cysteine. 
as indicated, the same type of ambiguity confounded the 
interpretation of all the experiments using di-, tri-, and

CHAPteR 7     From DNa to protein: how cells read the Genome

in an mRNA specifies the correct protein. We discuss later how a special 
punctuation signal at the beginning of each mRNA molecule sets the cor-
rect reading frame.

trNA molecules match Amino Acids to Codons in mrNA
The codons in an mRNA molecule do not directly recognize the amino 
acids  they  specify:  the  group  of  three  nucleotides  does  not,  for  exam-
ple, bind directly to the amino acid. Rather, the translation of mRNA into 
protein depends on adaptor molecules that can recognize and bind to a 
codon at one site on their surface and to an amino acid at another site. 
These adaptors consist of a set of small RNA molecules known as trans-
fer RNAs (tRNAs), each about 80 nucleotides in length.

We saw earlier that an RNA molecule generally folds into a three-dimen-
sional structure by forming base pairs between different regions of the 
molecule. If the base-paired regions are sufficiently extensive, they will 
fold back on themselves to form a double-helical structure, like that of 
double-stranded DNA. The tRNA molecule provides a striking example of 
this. Four short segments of the folded tRNA are double-helical, producing 
a molecule that looks like a cloverleaf when drawn schematically (Figure 
7–29A). For example, a 5′-GCUC-3′ sequence in one part of a polynucle-
otide chain can base-pair with a 5′-GAGC-3′ sequence in another region 
of the same molecule. The cloverleaf undergoes further folding to form a 
compact, L-shaped structure that is held together by additional hydrogen 
bonds between different regions of the molecule (Figure 7–29b and C).

Two regions of unpaired nucleotides situated at either end of the L-shaped 
tRNA molecule are crucial to the function of tRNAs in protein synthesis. 
One  of  these  regions  forms  the  anticodon,  a  set  of  three  consecutive 
nucleotides that bind, through base-pairing, to the complementary codon

anticodon loop (blue) contains the sequence of three nucleotides (red letters) that base-pairs with a codon in mrNa. the amino acid 
matching the codon–anticodon pair is attached at the 3′ end of the trNa. trNas contain some unusual bases, which are produced by 
chemical modification after the trNa has been synthesized. the bases denoted Ψ (for pseudouridine) and D (for dihydrouridine) are 
derived from uracil. (B and c) Views of the actual L-shaped molecule, based on X-ray diffraction analysis. these two images are rotated

in an mRNA molecule. The other is a short single-stranded region at the 
3′ end of the molecule; this is the site where the amino acid that matches 
the codon is covalently attached to the tRNA. 

We saw in the previous section that the genetic code is redundant; that 
is, several different codons can specify a single amino acid (see Figure 
7–25). This redundancy implies either that there is more than one tRNA 
for many of the amino acids or that some tRNA molecules can base-pair 
with more than one codon. In fact, both situations occur. Some amino 
acids  have  more  than  one  tRNA,  and  some  tRNAs  are  constructed  so 
that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of 
the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position. 
This wobble base-pairing explains why so many of the alternative codons 
for an amino acid differ only in their third nucleotide (see Figure 7–25). 
Wobble base-pairings make it possible to fit the 20 amino acids to their 
61 codons with as few as 31 kinds of tRNA molecules. The exact number 
of different kinds of tRNAs, however, differs from one species to the next. 
For example, humans have nearly 500 different tRNA genes, but only 48 
anticodons are represented among them.

specific enzymes Couple trNAs to the Correct Amino 
Acid
For a tRNA molecule to carry out its role as an adaptor, it must be linked—
or charged—with the correct amino acid. How does each tRNA molecule 
recognize the one amino acid in 20 that is its right partner? Recognition 
and  attachment  of  the  correct  amino  acid  depend  on  enzymes  called 
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which covalently couple each amino acid 
to its appropriate set of tRNA molecules. In most organisms, there is a 
different synthetase enzyme for each amino acid. That means that there 
are 20 synthetases in all: one attaches glycine to all tRNAs that recog-
nize codons for glycine, another attaches phenylalanine to all tRNAs that 
recognize codons for phenylalanine, and so on. Each synthetase enzyme 
recognizes  specific  nucleotides  in  both  the  anticodon  and  the  amino-
acid-accepting arm of the correct tRNA (Movie 7.6). The synthetases are 
thus equal in importance to the tRNAs in the decoding process, because 
it is the combined action of the synthetases and tRNAs that allows each 
codon  in  the  mRNA  molecule  to  specify  its  proper  amino  acid  (Figure 
7–30).

From rNa to protein         

243

Figure 7–30 the genetic code is 
translated by the cooperation of two 
adaptors: aminoacyl-tRnA synthetases 
and tRnAs. each synthetase couples a 
particular amino acid to its corresponding 
trNas, a process called charging. the 
anticodon on the charged trNa molecule 
then forms base pairs with the appropriate 
codon on the mrNa. an error in either 
the charging step or the binding of the 
charged trNa to its codon will cause the 
wrong amino acid to be incorporated into 
a protein chain. In the sequence of events 
shown, the amino acid tryptophan (trp) is 
selected by the codon UGG on the mrNa.

QuestioN 7–4

in a clever experiment performed in 
1962, a cysteine already attached to 
its trNA was chemically converted 
to an alanine. these “hybrid” trNA 
molecules were then added to a cell-
free translation system from which 
the normal cysteine-trNAs had 
been removed. When the resulting 
protein was analyzed, it was found 
that alanine had been inserted at 
every point in the polypeptide chain 
where cysteine was supposed to be. 
Discuss what this experiment tells 
you about the role of aminoacyl-
trNA synthetases during the normal 
translation of the genetic code.

The synthetase-catalyzed reaction that attaches the amino acid to the 3′ 
end of the tRNA is one of many reactions in cells coupled to the energy-
releasing  hydrolysis  of  ATP  (see  Figure  3–33).  The  reaction  produces  a 
high-energy bond between the charged tRNA and the amino acid. The 
energy of this bond is later used to link the amino acid covalently to the 
growing polypeptide chain. 

the mrNA message is Decoded by ribosomes
The recognition of a codon by the anticodon on a tRNA molecule depends 
on the same type of complementary base-pairing used in DNA replication 
and transcription. However, accurate and rapid translation of mRNA into 
protein requires a molecular machine that can move along the mRNA, 
capture complementary tRNA molecules, hold the tRNAs in position, and 
then covalently link the amino acids that they carry to form a polypeptide 
chain. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the machine that gets the job 
done is the ribosome—a large complex made from dozens of small pro-
teins (the ribosomal proteins) and several crucial RNA molecules called 
ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). A typical eukaryotic cell contains millions of 
ribosomes in its cytoplasm (Figure 7–31). 

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes are very similar in structure and 
function. Both are composed of one large subunit and one small subunit, 
which fit together to form a complete ribosome with a mass of several 
million  daltons  (Figure  7–32);  for  comparison,  an  average-sized  pro-
tein has a mass of 30,000 daltons. The small ribosomal subunit matches 
the tRNAs to the codons of the mRNA, while the large subunit catalyzes 
the formation of the peptide bonds that covalently link the amino acids 
together into a polypeptide chain. These two subunits come together on 
an mRNA molecule near its 5′ end to start the synthesis of a protein. The 
mRNA is then pulled through the ribosome like a long piece of tape. As 
the mRNA inches forward in a 5′-to-3′ direction, the ribosome translates 
its  nucleotide  sequence  into  an  amino  acid  sequence,  one  codon  at  a 
time, using the tRNAs as adaptors. Each amino acid is thereby added in 
the correct sequence to the end of the growing polypeptide chain (Movie 
7.7). When synthesis of the protein is finished, the two subunits of the 
ribosome  separate.  Ribosomes  operate  with  remarkable  efficiency:  a 
eukaryotic  ribosome  adds  about  2  amino  acids  to  a  polypeptide  chain 
each second; a bacterial ribosome operates even faster, adding about 20 
amino acids per second.

bound an mrNa. although ribosomal 
proteins greatly outnumber rrNas, the 
rNas account for most of the mass of the 
ribosome and give it its overall shape and 
structure.

How  does  the  ribosome  choreograph  all  the  movements  required  for 
translation?  In  addition  to  a  binding  site  for  an  mRNA  molecule,  each 
ribosome contains three binding sites for tRNA molecules, called the A 
site, the P site, and the E site (Figure 7–33). To add an amino acid to a 
growing peptide chain, the appropriate charged tRNA enters the A site 
by base-pairing with the complementary codon on the mRNA molecule. 
Its amino acid is then linked to the peptide chain held by the tRNA in the 
neighboring P site. Next, the large ribosomal subunit shifts forward, mov-
ing the spent tRNA to the E site before ejecting it (Figure 7–34). This cycle 
of reactions is repeated each time an amino acid is added to the polypep-
tide chain, with the new protein growing from its amino to its carboxyl 
end until a stop codon in the mRNA is encountered.

Figure 7–35 Ribosomal RnAs give the 
ribosome its overall shape. Shown here 
are the detailed structures of the two rrNas 
that form the core of the large subunit of 
a bacterial ribosome—the 23S rrNa (blue) 
and the 5S rrNa (purple). One of the protein 
subunits of the ribosome (L1) is included 
as a reference point, as this protein forms 
a characteristic protrusion on the ribosome 
surface. ribosomal components are commonly

refer to their rate of sedimentation in an 
ultracentrifuge. (adapted from N. Ban et al., 
Science 289:905–920, 2000. With permission 
from aaaS.)

Figure 7–34 translation takes place in a four-step cycle. this cycle 
is repeated over and over during the synthesis of a protein. In step 
1, a charged trNa carrying the next amino acid to be added to the 
polypeptide chain binds to the vacant a site on the ribosome by forming 
base pairs with the mrNa codon that is exposed there. Because only 
the appropriate trNa molecules can base-pair with each codon, this 
codon determines the specific amino acid added. the a and p sites are 
sufficiently close together that their two trNa molecules are forced to 
form base pairs with codons that are contiguous, with no stray bases in 
between. this positioning of the trNas ensures that the correct reading 
frame will be preserved throughout the synthesis of the protein. In step 
2, the carboxyl end of the polypeptide chain (amino acid 3 in step 1) is 
uncoupled from the trNa at the p site and joined by a peptide bond to 
the free amino group of the amino acid linked to the trNa at the a site. 
this reaction is catalyzed by an enzymatic site in the large subunit. In 
step 3, a shift of the large subunit relative to the small subunit moves the 
two trNas into the e and p sites of the large subunit. In step 4, the small 
subunit moves exactly three nucleotides along the mrNa molecule, 
bringing it back to its original position relative to the large subunit. this 
movement ejects the spent trNa and resets the ribosome with an empty 
a site so that the next charged trNa molecule can bind (Movie 7.8).   
   as indicated, the mrNa is translated in the 5′-to-3′ direction, and the 
N-terminal end of a protein is made first, with each cycle adding one 
amino acid to the c-terminus of the polypeptide chain. to watch the 
translation cycle in atomic detail, see Movie 7.9.

the ribosome is a ribozyme
The ribosome is one of the largest and most complex structures in the cell, 
composed of two-thirds RNA and one-third protein by weight. The deter-
mination of the entire three-dimensional structure of its large and small 
subunits in 2000 was a major triumph of modern biology. The structure 
confirmed earlier evidence that the rRNAs—not the proteins—are respon-
sible for the ribosome’s overall structure and its ability to choreograph 
and catalyze protein synthesis. 

The  rRNAs  are  folded  into  highly  compact,  precise  three-dimensional 
structures that form the core of the ribosome (Figure 7–35). In marked 
contrast to the central positioning of the rRNAs, the ribosomal proteins 
are generally located on the surface, where they fill the gaps and crevices 
of the folded RNA. The main role of the ribosomal proteins seems to be 

5S rRNA

L1

23S rRNA

to help fold and stabilize the RNA core, while permitting the changes in 
rRNA conformation that are necessary for this RNA to catalyze efficient 
protein synthesis.

Not only are the three tRNA-binding sites (the A, P, and E sites) on the 
ribosome formed primarily by the rRNAs, but the catalytic site for peptide 
bond formation is formed by the 23S rRNA of the large subunit; the near-
est ribosomal protein is located too far away to make contact with the 
incoming charged tRNA or with the growing polypeptide chain. The cata-
lytic site in this rRNA—a peptidyl transferase—is similar in many respects 
to that found in some protein enzymes: it is a highly structured pocket 
that precisely orients the two reactants—the elongating polypeptide and 
the charged tRNA—thereby greatly increasing the probability of a produc-
tive reaction.

RNA molecules that possess catalytic activity are called ribozymes. Later, 
in the final section of this chapter, we will consider other ribozymes and 
discuss what the existence of RNA-based catalysis might mean for the 
early evolution of life on Earth. Here we need only note that there is good 
reason to suspect that RNA rather than protein molecules served as the 
first catalysts for living cells. If so, the ribosome, with its catalytic RNA 
core, could be viewed as a relic of an earlier time in life’s history, when 
cells were run almost entirely by ribozymes.

specific Codons in mrNA signal the ribosome Where to 
start and to stop protein synthesis
In the test tube, ribosomes can be forced to translate any RNA molecule 
(see How We Know, pp. 240–241). In a cell, however, a specific start sig-
nal is required to initiate translation. The site at which protein synthesis 
begins on an mRNA is crucial, because it sets the reading frame for the 
whole length of the message. An error of one nucleotide either way at 
this stage will cause every subsequent codon in the mRNA to be misread, 
resulting in a nonfunctional protein with a garbled sequence of amino 
acids (see Figure 7–26). And the rate of initiation determines the rate at 
which the protein is synthesized from the mRNA.

The translation of an mRNA begins with the codon AUG, and a special 
charged  tRNA  is  required  to  initiate  translation.  This  initiator  tRNA 
always carries the amino acid methionine (or a modified form of methio-
nine, formyl-methionine, in bacteria). Thus newly made proteins all have 
methionine as the first amino acid at their N-terminal end, the end of a 
protein that is synthesized first. This methionine is usually removed later 
by a specific protease.

In eukaryotes, an initiator tRNA, charged with methionine, is first loaded 
into the P site of the small ribosomal subunit, along with additional pro-
teins  called  translation  initiation  factors  (Figure  7–36).  The  initiator 
tRNA is distinct from the tRNA that normally carries methionine. Of all 
the tRNAs in the cell, only a charged initiator tRNA molecule is capable of 
binding tightly to the P site in the absence of the large ribosomal subunit. 
Next, the small ribosomal subunit loaded with the initiator tRNA binds to 

Figure 7–36 initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes requires 
translation initiation factors and a special initiator tRnA. although 
not shown here, efficient translation initiation also requires additional 
proteins that are bound at the 5′ cap and poly-a tail of the mrNa 
(see Figure 7–23). In this way, the translation apparatus can ascertain 
that both ends of the mrNa are intact before initiating translation. 
Following initiation, the protein is elongated by the reactions outlined 
in Figure 7–34.

Figure 7–37 A single prokaryotic mRnA molecule can encode several different 
proteins. In prokaryotes, genes directing the different steps in a process are often 
organized into clusters (operons) that are transcribed together into a single mrNa.  
a prokaryotic mrNa does not have the same sort of 5′ cap as a eukaryotic mrNa, 
but instead has a triphosphate at its 5′ end. prokaryotic ribosomes initiate translation 
at ribosome-binding sites (dark blue), which can be located in the interior of an 
mrNa molecule. this feature enables prokaryotes to synthesize different proteins 
from a single mrNa molecule, with each protein made by a different ribosome.

ECB4 e7.36/7.37

the 5′ end of an mRNA molecule, which is marked by the 5′ cap that is 
present on all eukaryotic mRNAs (see Figure 7–16). The small ribosomal 
subunit then moves forward (5′ to 3′) along the mRNA searching for the 
first AUG. When this AUG is encountered and recognized by the initiator 
tRNA, several initiation factors dissociate from the small ribosomal sub-
unit to make way for the large ribosomal subunit to bind and complete 
ribosomal  assembly.  Because  the  initiator  tRNA  is  bound  to  the  P  site, 
protein synthesis is ready to begin with the addition of the next charged 
tRNA to the A site (see Figure 7–34).

The mechanism for selecting a start codon is different in bacteria. Bacterial 
mRNAs have no 5′ caps to tell the ribosome where to begin searching for 
the start of translation. Instead, they contain specific ribosome-binding 
sequences, up to six nucleotides long, that are located a few nucleotides 
upstream of the AUGs at which translation is to begin. Unlike a eukaryo-
tic ribosome, a prokaryotic ribosome can readily bind directly to a start 
codon that lies in the interior of an mRNA, as long as a ribosome-binding 
site precedes it by several nucleotides. Such ribosome-binding sequences 
are necessary in bacteria, as prokaryotic mRNAs are often polycistronic—
that is, they encode several different proteins, each of which is translated 
from the same mRNA molecule (Figure 7–37). In contrast, a eukaryotic 
mRNA usually carries the information for a single protein.

The end of translation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is signaled by 
the presence of one of several codons, called stop codons, in the mRNA 
(see Figure 7–25). The stop codons—UAA, UAG, and UGA—are not recog-
nized by a tRNA and do not specify an amino acid, but instead signal to 
the ribosome to stop translation. Proteins known as release factors bind 
to any stop codon that reaches the A site on the ribosome; this binding 
alters the activity of the peptidyl transferase in the ribosome, causing it to 
catalyze the addition of a water molecule instead of an amino acid to the 
peptidyl-tRNA (Figure 7–38). This reaction frees the carboxyl end of the 
polypeptide chain from its attachment to a tRNA molecule; because this 
is the only attachment that holds the growing polypeptide to the ribos-
ome, the completed protein chain is immediately released. At this point, 
the ribosome also releases the mRNA and dissociates into its two sepa-
rate subunits, which can then assemble on another mRNA molecule to 
begin a new round of protein synthesis.

Figure 7–38 translation halts at a stop codon. In the final phase of 
protein synthesis, the binding of release factor to an a site bearing 
a stop codon terminates translation of an mrNa molecule. the 
completed polypeptide is released, and the ribosome dissociates 
into its two separate subunits. Note that only the 3ʹ end of the mrNa 
molecule is shown here.

We saw in Chapter 4 that many proteins can fold into their three-dimen-
sional shape spontaneously, and some do so as they are spun out of the 
ribosome.  Most  proteins,  however,  require  chaperone  proteins  to  help 
them fold correctly in the cell. Chaperones can “steer” proteins along pro-
ductive folding pathways and prevent them from aggregating inside the 
cell (see Figures 4–9 and 4–10). Newly synthesized proteins are typically 
met by their chaperones as they emerge from the ribosome.

proteins Are made on polyribosomes
The synthesis of most protein molecules takes between 20 seconds and 
several minutes. But even during this short period, multiple ribosomes 
usually  bind  to  each  mRNA  molecule  being  translated.  If  the  mRNA  is 
being translated efficiently, a new ribosome hops onto the 5′ end of the 
mRNA  molecule  almost  as  soon  as  the  preceding  ribosome  has  trans-
lated  enough  of  the  nucleotide  sequence  to  move  out  of  the  way.  The 
mRNA molecules being translated are therefore usually found in the form 
of  polyribosomes,  also  known  as  polysomes.  These  large  cytoplasmic 
assemblies are made up of many ribosomes spaced as close as 80 nucle-
otides apart along a single mRNA molecule (Figure 7–39). With multiple 
ribosomes working simultaneously on a single mRNA, many more pro-
tein  molecules  can  be  made  in  a  given  time  than  would  be  possible  if 
each polypeptide had to be completed before the next could be started.

Polysomes  operate  in  both  bacteria  and  eukaryotes,  but  bacteria  can 
speed  up  the  rate  of  protein  synthesis  even  further.  Because  bacterial 
mRNA does not need to be processed and is also physically accessible to 
ribosomes while it is being made, ribosomes will typically attach to the 
free end of a bacterial mRNA molecule and start translating it even before 
the transcription of that RNA is complete; these ribosomes follow closely 
behind the RNA polymerase as it moves along DNA. 

inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis Are used as 
Antibiotics
The ability to translate mRNAs accurately into proteins is a fundamental 
feature of all life on Earth. Although the ribosome and other molecules 
that carry out this complex task are very similar among organisms, we

have  seen  that  there  are  some  subtle  differences  in  the  way  that  bac-
teria  and  eukaryotes  synthesize  RNA  and  proteins.  Through  a  quirk  of 
evolution, these differences form the basis of one of the most important 
advances in modern medicine.

Many of our most effective antibiotics are compounds that act by inhib-
iting  bacterial,  but  not  eukaryotic,  RNA  and  protein  synthesis.  Some 
of  these  drugs  exploit  the  small  structural  and  functional  differences 
between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes, so that they interfere pref-
erentially  with  bacterial  protein  synthesis.  These  compounds  can  thus 
be  taken  in  doses  high  enough  to  kill  bacteria  without  being  toxic  to 
humans.  Because  different  antibiotics  bind  to  different  regions  of  the 
bacterial  ribosome,  these  drugs  often  inhibit  different  steps  in  protein 
synthesis. A few of the antibiotics that inhibit bacterial RNA and protein 
synthesis are listed in table 7–3. 

Many common antibiotics were first isolated from fungi. Fungi and bacte-
ria often occupy the same ecological niches; to gain a competitive edge, 
fungi  have  evolved,  over  time,  potent  toxins  that  kill  bacteria  but  are 
harmless to themselves. Because fungi and humans are both eukaryotes, 
and are thus more closely related to each other than either is to bacteria 
(see Figure 1–28), we have been able to borrow these weapons to combat 
our own bacterial foes.

Controlled protein Breakdown helps regulate the Amount 
of each protein in a Cell
After a protein is released from the ribosome, a cell can control its activ-
ity and longevity in various ways. The number of copies of a protein in 
a cell depends, like the human population, not only on how quickly new 
individuals are made but also on how long they survive. So controlling 
the breakdown of proteins into their constituent amino acids helps cells 
regulate the amount of each particular protein. Proteins vary enormously 
in their life-span. Structural proteins that become part of a relatively sta-
ble  tissue  such  as  bone  or  muscle  may  last  for  months  or  even  years, 
whereas other proteins, such as metabolic enzymes and those that regu-
late cell growth and division (discussed in Chapter 18), last only for days, 
hours, or even seconds. How does the cell control these lifetimes?

Cells  possess  specialized  pathways  that  enzymatically  break  proteins 
down into their constituent amino acids (a process termed proteolysis). 
The enzymes that degrade proteins, first to short peptides and finally to 
individual amino acids, are known collectively as proteases. Proteases

act by cutting (hydrolyzing) the peptide bonds between amino acids (see 
Panel  2–5,  pp.  74–75).  One  function  of  proteolytic  pathways  is  to  rap-
idly degrade those proteins whose lifetimes must be kept short. Another 
is  to  recognize  and  remove  proteins  that  are  damaged  or  misfolded. 
Eliminating improperly folded proteins is critical for an organism, as mis-
folded proteins tend to aggregate, and protein aggregates can damage 
cells and even trigger cell death. Eventually, all proteins—even long-lived 
ones—accumulate damage and are degraded by proteolysis.

ECB4 e7.39/7.40

In eukaryotic cells, proteins are broken down by large protein machines 
called proteasomes, present in both the cytosol and the nucleus. A pro-
teasome contains a central cylinder formed from proteases whose active 
sites face into an inner chamber. Each end of the cylinder is stoppered by 
a large protein complex formed from at least 10 types of protein subunits 
(Figure 7–40). These protein stoppers bind the proteins destined for deg-
radation and then—using ATP hydrolysis to fuel this activity—unfold the 
doomed proteins and thread them into the inner chamber of the cylinder. 
Once the proteins are inside, proteases chop them into short peptides, 
which  are  then  jettisoned  from  either  end  of  the  proteasome.  Housing 
proteases inside these molecular destruction chambers makes sense, as 
it prevents the enzymes from running rampant in the cell. 

How do proteasomes select which proteins in the cell should be degraded? 
In  eukaryotes,  proteasomes  act  primarily  on  proteins  that  have  been 
marked  for  destruction  by  the  covalent  attachment  of  a  small  protein 
called ubiquitin. Specialized enzymes tag selected proteins with a short 
chain of ubiquitin molecules; these ubiquitylated proteins are then rec-
ognized, unfolded, and fed into proteasomes by proteins in the stopper 
(Figure 7–41).

CHAPteR 7     From DNa to protein: how cells read the Genome

Proteins  that  are  meant  to  be  short-lived  often  contain  a  short  amino 
acid sequence that identifies the protein as one to be ubiquitylated and 
degraded  in  proteasomes.  Damaged  or  misfolded  proteins,  as  well  as 
proteins  containing  oxidized  or  otherwise  abnormal  amino  acids,  are 
also  recognized  and  degraded  by  this  ubiquitin-dependent  proteolytic 
system. The enzymes that add a polyubiquitin chain to such proteins rec-
ognize signals that become exposed on these proteins as a result of the 
misfolding or chemical damage—for example, amino acid sequences or 
conformational motifs that remain buried and inaccessible in the normal 
“healthy” protein.

there Are many steps Between DNA and protein
We  have  seen  that  many  types  of  chemical  reactions  are  required  to 
produce  a  protein  from  the  information  contained  in  a  gene.  The  final 
concentration of a protein in a cell therefore depends on the rate at which 
each of the many steps is carried out (Figure  7–42). In addition, many 
proteins—once they leave the ribosome—require further attention before 
they are useful to the cell. Examples of such post-translational modifica-
tions include covalent modification (such as phosphorylation), the binding 
of small-molecule cofactors, or association with other protein subunits, 
which are often needed for a newly synthesized protein to become fully 
functional (Figure 7–43).

Figure 7–43 Many proteins require 
various modifications to become fully 
functional. to be useful to the cell, a 
completed polypeptide must fold correctly 
into its three-dimensional conformation 
and then bind any required cofactors (red) 
and protein partners—all via noncovalent 
bonding. Many proteins also require one 
or more covalent modifications to become 
active—or to be recruited to specific 
membranes or organelles (not shown). 
although phosphorylation and glycosylation 
are the most common, more than 100 types 
of covalent modifications of proteins are 
known. 

We will see in the next chapter that cells have the ability to change the 
concentrations of most of their proteins according to their needs. In prin-
ciple,  all  of  the  steps  in  Figure  7–42  can  be  regulated  by  the  cell—and 
many of them, in fact, are. However, as we will see in the next chapter, 
the initiation of transcription is the most common point for a cell to regu-
late the expression of its genes.

Transcription and translation are universal processes that lie at the heart 
of life. However, when scientists came to consider how the flow of infor-
mation from DNA to protein might have originated, they came to some 
unexpected conclusions.

rNA AND the origiNs of life
The central dogma—that DNA makes RNA that makes protein—presented 
evolutionary biologists with a knotty puzzle: if nucleic acids are required 
to direct the synthesis of proteins, and proteins are required to synthe-
size nucleic acids, how could this system of interdependent components 
have  arisen?  One  view  is  that  an  RNA  world  existed  on  Earth  before 
cells containing DNA and proteins appeared. According to this hypoth-
esis, RNA—which today serves largely as an intermediate between genes 
and  proteins—both  stored  genetic  information  and  catalyzed  chemical 
reactions in primitive cells. Only later in evolutionary time did DNA take 
over  as  the  genetic  material  and  proteins  become  the  major  catalysts 
and structural components of cells (Figure 7–44). If this idea is correct, 
then  the  transition  out  of  the  RNA  world  was  never  completed;  as  we 
have seen, RNA still catalyzes several fundamental reactions in modern 
cells. These RNA catalysts—or ribozymes—including those that operate 
in the ribosome and in the RNA-splicing machinery, can thus be viewed 
as molecular fossils of an earlier world.

life requires Autocatalysis 
The origin of life requires molecules that possess, if only to a small extent, 
one crucial property: the ability to catalyze reactions that lead—directly or 
indirectly—to the production of more molecules like themselves. Catalysts 
with this self-producing property, once they had arisen by chance, would 
divert  raw  materials  from  the  production  of  other  substances  to  make 
more of themselves. In this way, one can envisage the gradual develop-
ment of an increasingly complex chemical system of organic monomers 
and polymers that function together to generate more molecules of the 
same types, fueled by a supply of simple raw materials in the primitive 
environment  on  Earth.  Such  an  autocatalytic  system  would  have  many 
of the properties we think of as characteristic of living matter: the sys-
tem would contain a far-from-random selection of interacting molecules; 
it would tend to reproduce itself; it would compete with other systems 
dependent on the same raw materials; and, if deprived of its raw mat-
erials or maintained at a temperature that upset the balance of reaction 
rates, it would decay toward chemical equilibrium and “die.”

CHAPteR 7     From DNa to protein: how cells read the Genome

But  what  molecules  could  have  had  such  autocatalytic  properties?  In 
present-day living cells, the most versatile catalysts are proteins, which 
are able to adopt diverse three-dimensional forms that bristle with chem-
ically reactive sites on their surface. However, there is no known way in 
which a protein can reproduce itself directly. RNA molecules, by contrast, 
could—at least, in principle—catalyze their own synthesis.

rNA Can Both store information and Catalyze Chemical 
reactions
We have seen that complementary base-pairing enables one nucleic acid 
to act as a template for the formation of another. Thus a single strand of 
RNA  or  DNA  can  specify  the  sequence  of  a  complementary  polynucle-
otide, which, in turn, can specify the sequence of the original molecule, 
allowing  the  original  nucleic  acid  to  be  replicated  (Figure  7–45).  Such 
complementary templating mechanisms lie at the heart of both DNA rep-
lication and transcription in modern-day cells.

But  the  efficient  synthesis  of  polynucleotides  by  such  complementary 
templating mechanisms also requires catalysts to promote the polymeri-
zation reaction: without catalysts, polymer formation is slow, error-prone, 
and inefficient. Today, nucleotide polymerization is catalyzed by protein 
enzymes—such as DNA and RNA polymerases. But how could this reac-
tion  be  catalyzed  before  proteins  with  the  appropriate  catalytic  ability 
existed?  The  beginnings  of  an  answer  were  obtained  in  1982,  when  it 
was discovered that RNA molecules themselves can act as catalysts. The 
unique  potential  of  RNA  molecules  to  act  both  as  information  carriers 
and as catalysts is thought to have enabled them to have a central role 
in the origin of life. 

In present-day cells, RNA is synthesized as a single-stranded molecule, 
and we have seen that complementary base-pairing can occur between 
nucleotides  in  the  same  chain.  This  base-pairing,  along  with  noncon-
ventional hydrogen bonds, can cause each RNA molecule to fold up in 
a unique way that is determined by its nucleotide sequence (see Figure 
7–5). Such associations produce complex three-dimensional shapes.

As  we  discuss  in  Chapter  4,  protein  enzymes  are  able  to  catalyze  bio-
chemical  reactions  because  they  have  surfaces  with  unique  contours 
and  chemical  properties.  In  the  same  way,  RNA  molecules,  with  their 
unique folded shapes, can serve as catalysts (Figure 7–46). RNAs do not 
have the same structural and functional diversity as do protein enzymes; 
they  are,  after  all,  built  from  only  four  different  subunits.  Nonetheless, 
ribozymes can catalyze many types of chemical reactions. Most of the 
ribozymes that have been studied were constructed in the laboratory and 
selected for their catalytic activity in a test tube (table 7–4), as relatively 
few catalytic RNAs exist in present-day cells. But the processes in which 
catalytic RNAs still seem to have major roles include some of the most 

Figure 7–45 An RnA molecule can in 
principle guide the formation of an 
exact copy of itself. In the first step, the 
original rNa molecule acts as a template to 
form an rNa molecule of complementary 
sequence. In the second step, this 
complementary rNa molecule itself acts 
as a template to form an rNa molecule of 
the original sequence. Since each template 
molecule can produce many copies of the 
complementary strand, these reactions can 
result in the amplification of the original 
sequence.

fundamental steps in the expression of genetic information—especially 
those steps where RNA molecules themselves are spliced or translated 
into protein.

RNA, therefore, has all the properties required of a molecule that could 
catalyze its own synthesis (Figure 7–47). Although self-replicating sys-
tems of RNA molecules have not been found in nature, scientists appear 
to be well on the way to constructing them in the laboratory. Although 
this demonstration would not prove that self-replicating RNA molecules 
were essential to the origin of life on Earth, it would establish that such 
a scenario is possible.

rNA is thought to predate DNA in evolution 
The  first  cells  on  Earth  would  presumably  have  been  much  less  com-
plex and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest 
present-day cells. They would have consisted of little more than a simple 
membrane enclosing a set of self-replicating molecules and a few other 
components required to provide the materials and energy for this auto-
catalytic replication. If the evolutionary role for RNA proposed above is 
correct, these earliest cells would also have differed fundamentally from 
the cells we know today in having their hereditary information stored in 
RNA rather than DNA.

Evidence that RNA arose before DNA in evolution can be found in the 
chemical  differences  between  them.  Ribose  (see  Figure  7–3A),  like

Figure 7–48 RnA may have preceded 
DnA and proteins in evolution. according 
to this hypothesis, rNa molecules provided 
genetic, structural, and catalytic functions in 
the earliest cells. DNa is now the repository 
of genetic information, and proteins carry 
out almost all catalysis in cells. rNa now 
functions mainly as a go-between in protein 
synthesis, while remaining a catalyst for 
a few crucial reactions (including protein 
synthesis).

QuestioN 7–6

Discuss the following: “During the 
evolution of life on earth, rNA lost 
its glorious position as the first self-
replicating catalyst. its role now is as 
a mere messenger in the information 
flow from DNA to protein.”

glucose and other simple carbohydrates, is readily formed from formal-
dehyde  (HCHO),  which  is  one  of  the  principal  products  of  experiments 
simulating  conditions  on  the  primitive  Earth.  The  sugar  deoxyribose  is 
harder  to  make,  and  in  present-day  cells  it  is  produced  from  ribose  in 
a  reaction  catalyzed  by  a  protein  enzyme,  suggesting  that  ribose  pre-
dates deoxyribose in cells. Presumably, DNA appeared on the scene after 
RNA, and then proved more suited than RNA as a permanent repository 
of genetic information. In particular, the deoxyribose in its sugar–phos-
phate backbone makes chains of DNA chemically much more stable than 
chains of RNA, so that greater lengths of DNA can be maintained without 
breakage.

The other differences between RNA and DNA—the double-helical struc-
ture of DNA and the use of thymine rather than uracil—further enhance 
DNA stability by making the molecule easier to repair. We saw in Chapter 
6 that a damaged nucleotide on one strand of the double helix can be 
repaired by using the other strand as a template. Furthermore, deamina-
tion, one of the most common unwanted chemical changes occurring in 
polynucleotides, is easier to detect and repair in DNA than in RNA (see 
Figure 6–23). This is because the product of the deamination of cytosine 
is, by chance, uracil, which already exists in RNA, so that such damage 
would be impossible for repair enzymes to detect in an RNA molecule. 
However, in DNA, which has thymine rather than uracil, any uracil pro-
duced by the accidental deamination of cytosine is easily detected and 
repaired.

Taken together, the evidence we have discussed supports the idea that 
RNA—with  its  ability  to  provide  genetic,  structural,  and  catalytic  func-
tions—preceded  DNA  in  evolution.  As  cells  more  closely  resembling 
present-day cells appeared, it is believed that many of the functions orig-
inally  performed  by  RNA  were  taken  over  by  DNA  and  proteins:  DNA 
took over the primary genetic function, and proteins became the major 
catalysts, while RNA remained primarily as the intermediary connecting 
the two (Figure 7–48). With the advent of DNA, cells were able to become 
more  complex,  for  they  could  then  carry  and  transmit  more  genetic 
information than could be stably maintained by RNA alone. Because of 
the  greater  chemical  complexity  of  proteins  and  the  variety  of  chemi-
cal  reactions  they  can  catalyze,  the  shift  (albeit  incomplete)  from  RNA 
to proteins also provided a much richer source of structural components 
and enzymes. This enabled cells to evolve the great diversity of structure 
and function that we see in life today.

one remarkable feature of the genetic code is that amino 
acids with similar chemical properties often have similar 
codons. thus codons with u or C as the second nucleotide 
tend to specify hydrophobic amino acids. Can you suggest 
a possible explanation for this phenomenon in terms of the 
early evolution of the protein-synthesis machinery? 

QuestioN 7–14
A mutation in DNA generates a ugA stop codon in the 
middle of the mrNA coding for a particular protein. 
A second mutation in the cell’s DNA leads to a single 
nucleotide change in a trNA that allows the correct 
translation of the protein; that is, the second mutation 
“suppresses” the defect caused by the first. the altered 
trNA translates the ugA as tryptophan. What nucleotide 
change has probably occurred in the mutant trNA 
molecule? What consequences would the presence of such 
a mutant trNA have for the translation of the normal genes 
in this cell?

QuestioN 7–15
the charging of a trNA with an amino acid can be 
represented by the following equation:
amino acid + trNA + Atp → aminoacyl-trNA + Amp + ppi
where ppi is pyrophosphate (see figure 3–40). in the 
aminoacyl-trNA, the amino acid and trNA are linked with 
a high-energy covalent bond; a large portion of the energy 
derived from the hydrolysis of Atp is thus stored in this 
bond and is available to drive peptide bond formation at the 
later stages of protein synthesis. the free-energy change of 
the charging reaction shown in the equation is close to zero 
and therefore would not be expected to favor attachment 
of the amino acid to trNA. Can you suggest a further step 
that could drive the reaction to completion? 

QuestioN 7–16
A.  the average molecular weight of a protein in the cell is 
about 30,000 daltons. A few proteins, however, are much 
larger. the largest known polypeptide chain made by any 
cell is a protein called titin (made by mammalian muscle 
cells), and it has a molecular weight of 3,000,000 daltons. 
estimate how long it will take a muscle cell to translate 
an mrNA coding for titin (assume the average molecular 
weight of an amino acid to be 120, and a translation rate of 
two amino acids per second for eukaryotic cells). 
B.  protein synthesis is very accurate: for every 10,000 
amino acids joined together, only one mistake is made. 
What is the fraction of average-sized protein molecules and 
of titin molecules that are synthesized without any errors? 
(hint: the probability P of obtaining an error-free protein is 
given by P = (1 – E)n, where E is the error frequency and n 
the number of amino acids.)
C.  the molecular weight of all eukaryotic ribosomal 
proteins combined is about 2.5 × 106 daltons. Would it be 
advantageous to synthesize them as a single protein?
D.  transcription occurs at a rate of about 30 nucleotides

Control of Gene Expression

An organism’s DNA encodes all of the RNA and protein molecules that are 
needed to make its cells. Yet a complete description of the DNA sequence 
of an organism—be it the few million nucleotides of a bacterium or the 
few billion nucleotides in each human cell—does not enable us to recon-
struct that organism any more than a list of all the English words in a 
dictionary enables us to reconstruct a play by Shakespeare. We need to 
know how the elements in the DNA sequence or the words on a list work 
together to make the masterpiece. 

For cells, the question involves gene expression. Even the simplest single-
celled  bacterium  can  use  its  genes  selectively—for  example,  switching 
genes on and off to make the enzymes needed to digest whatever food 
sources are available. In multicellular plants and animals, however, gene 
expression  is  under  much  more  elaborate  control.  Over  the  course  of 
embryonic development, a fertilized egg cell gives rise to many cell types 
that  differ  dramatically  in  both  structure  and  function.  The  differences 
between an information-processing nerve cell and an infection-fighting 
white blood cell, for example, are so extreme that it is difficult to imagine 
that the two cells contain the same DNA (Figure 8–1). For this reason, 
and because cells in an adult organism rarely lose their distinctive char-
acteristics,  biologists  originally  suspected  that  certain  genes  might  be 
selectively  lost  when  a  cell  becomes  specialized.  We  now  know,  how-
ever,  that  nearly  all  the  cells  of  a  multicellular  organism  contain  the 
same genome. Cell differentiation is instead achieved by changes in gene 
expression. 

In mammals, hundreds of different cell types carry out a range of spe-
cialized functions that depend upon genes that are switched on in that

Figure 8–1 a neuron and a liver cell share the same genome. 
the long branches of this neuron from the retina enable it to receive 
electrical signals from many other neurons and carry them to many 
neighboring neurons. the liver cell, which is drawn to the same scale, 
is involved in many metabolic processes, including digestion and the 
detoxification of alcohol and other drugs. Both of these mammalian 
cells contain the same genome, but they express many different rNas 
and proteins. (Neuron adapted from S. ramón y cajal, histologie

cell type but not in most others: for example, the β cells of the pancreas 
make the protein hormone insulin, while the α cells of the pancreas make 
the hormone glucagon; the B lymphocytes of the immune system make 
antibodies, while developing red blood cells make the oxygen-transport 
protein  hemoglobin.  The  differences  between  a  neuron,  a  white  blood 
cell,  a  pancreatic β  cell,  and  a  red  blood  cell  depend  upon  the  precise 
control  of  gene  expression.  A  typical  differentiated  cell  expresses  only 
about half the genes in its total repertoire.

In this chapter, we discuss the main ways in which gene expression is 
regulated,  with  a  focus  on  those  genes  that  encode  proteins  as  their 
final product. Although some of these control mechanisms apply to both 
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells—with their more complex 
chromosomal structure—have some ways of controlling gene expression 
that are not available to bacteria.

An overview of gene expression
Gene expression is a complex process by which cells selectively direct 
the synthesis of the many thousands of proteins and RNAs encoded in 
their genome. But how do cells coordinate and control such an intricate 
process—and how does an individual cell specify which of its genes to 
express?  This  decision  is  an  especially  important  problem  for  animals 
because,  as  they  develop,  their  cells  become  highly  specialized,  ulti-
mately producing an array of muscle, nerve, and blood cells, along with 
the hundreds of other cell types seen in the adult. Such cell differentia-
tion arises because cells make and accumulate different sets of RNA and 
protein molecules: that is, they express different genes.

the different cell types of a multicellular organism 
contain the same dnA
The  evidence  that  cells  have  the  ability  to  change  which  genes  they 
express  without  altering  the  nucleotide  sequence  of  their  DNA  comes 
from experiments in which the genome from a differentiated cell is made 
to direct the development of a complete organism. If the chromosomes of 
the differentiated cell were altered irreversibly during development, they 
would not be able to accomplish this feat. 

Consider, for example, an experiment in which the nucleus is taken from 
a skin cell in an adult frog and injected into a frog egg from which the 
nucleus  has  been  removed.  In  at  least  some  cases,  that  doctored  egg 
will develop into a normal tadpole (Figure 8–2). Thus, the transplanted 
skin-cell nucleus cannot have lost any critical DNA sequences. Nuclear 
transplantation  experiments  carried  out  with  differentiated  cells  taken 
from  adult  mammals—including  sheep,  cows,  pigs,  goats,  and  mice—
have shown similar results. And in plants, individual cells removed from 
a carrot, for example, can regenerate an entire adult carrot plant. These 
experiments all show that the DNA in specialized cell types of multicel-
lular organisms still contains the entire set of instructions needed to form

Figure 8–2 Differentiated cells contain all the genetic instructions necessary to direct the formation of a 
complete organism. (a) the nucleus of a skin cell from an adult frog transplanted into an egg whose nucleus has 
been destroyed can give rise to an entire tadpole. the broken arrow indicates that to give the transplanted genome 
time to adjust to an embryonic environment, a further transfer step is required in which one of the nuclei is taken 
from the early embryo that begins to develop and is put back into a second enucleated egg. (B) In many types of 
plants, differentiated cells retain the ability to “de-differentiate,” so that a single cell can proliferate to form a clone 
of progeny cells that later give rise to an entire plant. (c) a nucleus removed from a differentiated cell from an adult 
cow can be introduced into an enucleated egg from a different cow to give rise to a calf. Different calves produced 
from the same differentiated cell donor are all clones of the donor and are therefore genetically identical.

a whole organism. The various cell types of an organism therefore differ 
not because they contain different genes, but because they express them 
differently.

ECB4 e8.02/8.02

different cell types produce different sets of proteins
The extent of the differences in gene expression between different cell 
types may be roughly gauged by comparing the protein composition of 
cells in liver, heart, brain, and so on. In the past, such analysis was per-
formed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (see Panel 4–5, p. 167). 
Nowadays, the total protein content of a cell can be rapidly analyzed by 

264 

CHapTEr 8     control of Gene expression

a method called mass spectrometry (see Figure 4–49). This technique is 
much more sensitive than electrophoresis and it enables the detection of 
even proteins that are produced in minor quantities. 

Both techniques reveal that many proteins are common to all the cells of 
a multicellular organism. These housekeeping proteins include, for exam-
ple,  the  structural  proteins  of  chromosomes,  RNA  polymerases,  DNA 
repair enzymes, ribosomal proteins, enzymes involved in glycolysis and 
other basic metabolic processes, and many of the proteins that form the 
cytoskeleton. In addition, each different cell type also produces special-
ized proteins that are responsible for the cell’s distinctive properties. In 
mammals, for example, hemoglobin is made almost exclusively in devel-
oping red blood cells.

Gene expression can also be studied by cataloging a cell’s RNAs, includ-
ing the mRNAs that encode protein. The most comprehensive methods for 
such analyses involve determining the nucleotide sequence of every RNA 
molecule made by the cell, an approach that can also reveal their rela-
tive abundance. Estimates of the number of different mRNA sequences in 
human cells suggest that, at any one time, a typical differentiated human 
cell expresses perhaps 5000–15,000 protein-coding genes from a total of 
about 21,000. It is the expression of a different collection of genes in each 
cell type that causes the large variations seen in the size, shape, behavior, 
and function of differentiated cells.

A cell can change the expression of its genes in 
response to external signals
The  specialized  cells  in  a  multicellular  organism  are  capable  of  alter-
ing their patterns of gene expression in response to extracellular cues. 
For  example,  if  a  liver  cell  is  exposed  to  the  steroid  hormone  cortisol, 
the  production  of  several  proteins  is  dramatically  increased.  Released 
by  the  adrenal  gland  during  periods  of  starvation,  intense  exercise,  or 
prolonged  stress,  cortisol  signals  liver  cells  to  boost  the  production  of 
glucose  from  amino  acids  and  other  small  molecules.  The  set  of  pro-
teins  whose  production  is  induced  by  cortisol  includes  enzymes  such 
as  tyrosine  aminotransferase,  which  helps  convert  tyrosine  to  glucose. 
When the hormone is no longer present, the production of these proteins 
returns to its resting level.

Other cell types respond to cortisol differently. In fat cells, for example, 
the production of tyrosine aminotransferase is reduced, while some other 
cell  types  do  not  respond  to  cortisol  at  all.  The  fact  that  different  cell 
types  often  respond  in  different  ways  to  the  same  extracellular  signal 
contributes to the specialization that gives each cell type its distinctive 
character.

gene expression can Be regulated at various steps from 
dnA to rnA to protein
If  differences  among  the  various  cell  types  of  an  organism  depend  on 
the  particular  genes  that  the  cells  express,  at  what  level  is  the  control 
of gene expression exercised? As we saw in the last chapter, there are 
many steps in the pathway leading from DNA to protein, and all of them 
can in principle be regulated. Thus a cell can control the proteins it con-
tains by (1) controlling when and how often a given gene is transcribed, 
(2) controlling how an RNA transcript is spliced or otherwise processed, 
(3) selecting which mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol, 
(4)  regulating  how  quickly  certain  mRNA  molecules  are  degraded,  
(5) selecting which mRNAs are translated into protein by ribosomes, or

(6) regulating how rapidly specific proteins are destroyed after they have 
been made; in addition, the activity of individual proteins can be further 
regulated in a variety of ways. These steps are illustrated in Figure 8–3.

Gene expression can be regulated at each of these steps. For most genes, 
however,  the  control  of  transcription  (step  number  1  in  Figure  8–3)  is 
paramount. This makes sense because only transcriptional control can 
ensure  that  no  unnecessary  intermediates  are  synthesized.  So  it  is  the 
regulation of transcription—and the DNA and protein components that 
determine which genes a cell transcribes into RNA—that we address first.

how trAnscriptionAl switches work
Until 50 years ago, the idea that genes could be switched on and off was 
revolutionary. This concept was a major advance, and it came originally 
from studies of how E. coli bacteria adapt to changes in the composition 
of their growth medium. Many of the same principles apply to eukaryotic 
cells.  However,  the  enormous  complexity  of  gene  regulation  in  higher 
organisms, combined with the packaging of their DNA into chromatin, 
creates special challenges and some novel opportunities for control—as 
we  will  see.  We  begin  with  a  discussion  of  the  transcription  regulators, 
proteins that bind to DNA and control gene transcription.

transcription regulators Bind to regulatory dnA 
sequences
Control of transcription is usually exerted at the step at which the proc-
ess is initiated. In Chapter 7, we saw that the promoter region of a gene 
binds the enzyme RNA polymerase and correctly orients the enzyme to 
begin its task of making an RNA copy of the gene. The promoters of both 
bacterial and eukaryotic genes include a transcription initiation site, where 
RNA synthesis begins, plus a sequence of approximately 50 nucleotide 
pairs  that  extends  upstream  from  the  initiation  site  (if  one  likens  the 
direction  of  transcription  to  the  flow  of  a  river).  This  upstream  region 
contains sites that are required for the RNA polymerase to recognize the 
promoter, although they do not bind to RNA polymerase directly. Instead, 
these sequences contain recognition sites for proteins that associate with 
the active polymerase—sigma factor in bacteria (see Figure 7–9) or the 
general transcription factors in eukaryotes (see Figure 7–12).

In addition to the promoter, nearly all genes, whether bacterial or eukary-
otic, have regulatory DNA sequences that are used to switch the gene 
on or off. Some regulatory DNA sequences are as short as 10 nucleotide 
pairs  and  act  as  simple  switches  that  respond  to  a  single  signal;  such 
simple  regulatory  switches  predominate  in  bacteria.  Other  regulatory 
DNA  sequences,  especially  those  in  eukaryotes,  are  very  long  (some-
times spanning more than 10,000 nucleotide pairs) and act as molecular

Figure 8–4 a transcription regulator interacts with the major groove of a DNa double helix. (a) this regulator 
recognizes DNa via three α helices, shown as numbered cylinders, which allow the protein to fit into the major 
groove and form tight associations with the base pairs in a short stretch of DNa. this particular structural motif, 
called a homeodomain, is found in many eukaryotic DNa-binding proteins (movie 8.1). (B) Most of the contacts with 
the DNa bases are made by helix 3 (red ), which is shown here end-on. the protein interacts with the edges of the 
nucleotides without disrupting the hydrogen bonds that hold the base pairs together. (c) an asparagine residue 
from helix 3 forms two hydrogen bonds with the adenine in an a-t base pair. the view is end-on looking down the 
DNa double helix, and the protein contacts the base pair from the major groove side. For simplicity, only one amino 
acid–base contact is shown; in reality, transcription regulators form hydrogen bonds (as shown here), ionic bonds, 
and hydrophobic interactions with individual bases in the major groove. typically, the protein–DNa interface would 
consist of 10–20 such contacts, each involving a different amino acid and each contributing to the overall strength of 
the protein–DNa interaction. 

ECB4 E8.04,05/8.04

microprocessors, integrating information from a variety of signals into a 
command that dictates how often transcription of the gene is initiated.

Regulatory  DNA  sequences  do  not  work  by  themselves.  To  have  any 
effect,  these  sequences  must  be  recognized  by  proteins  called  tran-
scription  regulators.  It  is  the  binding  of  a  transcription  regulator  to  a 
regulatory DNA sequence that acts as the switch to control transcription. 
The  simplest  bacterium  produces  several  hundred  different  transcrip-
tion regulators, each of which recognizes a different DNA sequence and 
thereby regulates a distinct set of genes. Humans make many more—sev-
eral thousand—indicating the importance and complexity of this form of 
gene regulation in the development and function of a complex organism.

Proteins  that  recognize  a  specific  nucleotide  sequence  do  so  because 
the surface of the protein fits tightly against the surface features of the 
DNA double helix in that region. Because these surface features will vary 
depending  on  the  nucleotide  sequence,  different  DNA-binding  proteins 
will recognize different nucleotide sequences. In most cases, the protein 
inserts  into  the  major  groove  of  the  DNA  helix  and  makes  a  series  of 
intimate molecular contacts with the nucleotide pairs within the groove 
(Figure 8–4). Although each individual contact is weak, the 10 to 20 con-
tacts that are typically formed at the protein–DNA interface combine to 
ensure that the interaction is both highly specific and very strong; indeed, 
protein–DNA  interactions  are  among  the  tightest  and  most  specific 
molecular interactions known in biology. 
Many  transcription  regulators  bind  to  the  DNA  helix  as  dimers  (Figure 
8–5).  Such  dimerization  roughly  doubles  the  area  of  contact  with  the 
DNA, thereby greatly increasing the strength and specificity of the pro-
tein–DNA interaction.

transcriptional switches Allow cells to respond to 
changes in their environment 
The simplest and best understood examples of gene regulation occur in 
bacteria and in the viruses that infect them. The genome of the bacterium 
E. coli consists of a single circular DNA molecule of about 4.6 × 106 nucle-
otide  pairs.  This  DNA  encodes  approximately  4300  proteins,  although 
only a fraction of these are made at any one time. Bacteria regulate the 
expression of many of their genes according to the food sources that are 
available in the environment. For example, in E. coli, five genes code for 
enzymes that manufacture the amino acid tryptophan. These genes are 
arranged in a cluster on the chromosome and are transcribed from a sin-
gle promoter as one long mRNA molecule; such coordinately transcribed 
clusters are called operons (Figure 8–6). Although operons are common 
in bacteria, they are rare in eukaryotes, where genes are transcribed and 
regulated individually (see Figure 7–2). 

When  tryptophan  concentrations  are  low,  the  operon  is  transcribed; 
the  resulting  mRNA  is  translated  to  produce  a  full  set  of  biosynthetic 
enzymes, which work in tandem to synthesize tryptophan. When tryp-
tophan  is  abundant,  however—for  example,  when  the  bacterium  is  in 
the gut of a mammal that has just eaten a protein-rich meal—the amino 
acid is imported into the cell and shuts down production of the enzymes, 
which are no longer needed. 

We  now  understand  in  considerable  detail  how  this  repression  of  the 
tryptophan operon comes about. Within the operon’s promoter is a short 
DNA sequence, called the operator (see Figure 8–6), that is recognized 
by a transcription regulator. When this regulator binds to the operator, it 
blocks access of RNA polymerase to the promoter, preventing transcrip-
tion of the operon and production of the tryptophan-producing enzymes. 
The transcription regulator is known as the tryptophan repressor, and it is 
controlled in an ingenious way: the repressor can bind to DNA only if it 
has also bound several molecules of tryptophan (Figure 8–7). 

The tryptophan repressor is an allosteric protein (see Figure 4–41): the 
binding  of  tryptophan  causes  a  subtle  change  in  its  three-dimensional 
structure so that the protein can bind to the operator sequence. When 
the concentration of free tryptophan in the bacterium drops, the repres-
sor no longer binds to DNA, and the tryptophan operon is transcribed. 
The repressor is thus a simple device that switches production of a set of 
biosynthetic enzymes on and off according to the availability of the end 
product of the pathway that the enzymes catalyze.

The tryptophan repressor protein itself is always present in the cell. The 
gene that encodes it is continuously transcribed at a low level, so that a 
small amount of the repressor protein is always being made. Thus the 
bacterium can respond very rapidly to a rise in tryptophan concentration.

Figure 8–5 Many transcription regulators 
bind to DNa as dimers. this transcription 
regulator contains a leucine zipper motif, 
which is formed by two α helices, each 
contributed by a different protein subunit. 
Leucine zipper proteins thus bind to DNa 
as dimers, gripping the double helix like a 
clothespin on a clothesline (movie 8.2).

Figure 8–6 a cluster of bacterial genes 
can be transcribed from a single 
promoter. each of these five genes encodes 
a different enzyme; all of the enzymes 
are needed to synthesize the amino acid 
tryptophan. the genes are transcribed as a 
single mrNa molecule, a feature that allows 
their expression to be coordinated. clusters 
of genes transcribed as a single mrNa 
molecule are common in bacteria. each of 
these clusters is called an operon because 
its expression is controlled by a regulatory 
DNa sequence called the operator (green), 
situated within the promoter. the yellow 
blocks in the promoter represent DNa 
sequences that bind rNa polymerase.

Figure 8–7 Genes can be switched off by repressor proteins. If the concentration of tryptophan inside a 
bacterium is low (left), rNa polymerase (blue) binds to the promoter and transcribes the five genes of the tryptophan 
operon. however, if the concentration of tryptophan is high (right), the repressor protein (dark green) becomes active 
and binds to the operator (light green), where it blocks the binding of rNa polymerase to the promoter. Whenever 
the concentration of intracellular tryptophan drops, the repressor falls off the DNa, allowing the polymerase to 
again transcribe the operon. the promoter contains two key blocks of DNa sequence information, the –35 and –10 
regions, highlighted in yellow, which are recognized by rNa polymerase (see Figure 7–10). the complete operon is 
shown in Figure 8–6.

repressors turn genes off and Activators turn them on
The  tryptophan  repressor,  as  its  name  suggests,  is  a  transcriptional 
repressor protein: in its active form, it switches genes off, or represses 
them. Some bacterial transcription regulators do the opposite: they switch 
genes  on,  or  activate  them.  These  transcriptional  activator  proteins 
work on promoters that—in contrast to the promoter for the tryptophan 
operon—are only marginally able to bind and position RNA polymerase 
on their own. However, these poorly functioning promoters can be made 
fully  functional  by  activator  proteins  that  bind  nearby  and  contact  the 
RNA polymerase to help it initiate transcription (Figure 8–8). 

ECB4 e8.07/8.07

Like the tryptophan repressor, activator proteins often have to interact 
with a second molecule to be able to bind DNA. For example, the bacte-
rial  activator  protein  CAP  has  to  bind  cyclic  AMP  (cAMP)  before  it  can 
bind to DNA (see Figure 4–19). Genes activated by CAP are switched on 
in  response  to  an  increase  in  intracellular  cAMP  concentration,  which 
rises when glucose, the bacterium’s preferred carbon source, is no longer 
available; as a result, CAP drives the production of enzymes that allow 
the bacterium to digest other sugars.

An Activator and a repressor control the Lac operon
In many instances, the activity of a single promoter is controlled by two 
different transcription regulators. The Lac operon in E. coli, for example,

Figure 8–8 Genes can be switched on by

binds to a regulatory sequence on the DNa 
and then interacts with the rNa polymerase 
to help it initiate transcription. Without 
the activator, the promoter fails to initiate 
transcription efficiently. In bacteria, the 
binding of the activator to DNa is often 
controlled by the interaction of a metabolite 
or other small molecule (red triangle) with 
the activator protein. the Lac operon works 
in this manner, as we discuss shortly.

Question 8–1

Bacterial cells can take up the 
amino acid tryptophan (trp) from 
their surroundings, or if there is an 
insufficient external supply they can 
synthesize tryptophan from other 
small molecules. the trp repressor is 
a transcription regulator that shuts 
off the transcription of genes that 
code for the enzymes required for 
the synthesis of tryptophan (see 
figure 8–7).
A.  what would happen to the 
regulation of the tryptophan operon 
in cells that express a mutant form 
of the tryptophan repressor that  
(1) cannot bind to dnA, (2) cannot 
bind tryptophan, or (3) binds 
to dnA even in the absence of 
tryptophan? 
B.  what would happen in 
scenarios (1), (2), and (3) if the 
cells, in addition, produced normal 
tryptophan repressor protein from a 
second, normal gene?

is  controlled  by  both  the  Lac  repressor  and  the  CAP  activator  that  we 
just discussed. The Lac operon encodes proteins required to import and 
digest the disaccharide lactose. In the absence of glucose, the bacterium 
makes cAMP, which activates CAP to switch on genes that allow the cell 
to  utilize  alternative  sources  of  carbon—including  lactose.  It  would  be 
wasteful, however, for CAP to induce expression of the Lac operon if lac-
tose itself were not present. Thus the Lac repressor shuts off the operon 
in the absence of lactose. This arrangement enables the control region 
of the Lac operon to integrate two different signals, so that the operon 
is highly expressed only when two conditions are met: glucose must be 
absent and lactose must be present (Figure 8–9). This genetic circuit thus 
behaves much like a switch that carries out a logic operation in a compu-
ter. When lactose is present AND glucose is absent, the cell executes the 
appropriate program—in this case, transcription of the genes that permit 
the uptake and utilization of lactose.

The elegant logic of the Lac operon first attracted the attention of biolo-
gists more than 50 years ago. The molecular basis of the switch in E. coli 
was uncovered by a combination of genetics and biochemistry, provid-
ing the first insight into how transcription is controlled. In a eukaryotic 
cell,  similar  transcription  regulatory  devices  are  combined  to  generate 
increasingly complex circuits, including those that enable a fertilized egg 
to form the tissues and organs of a multicellular organism.

Figure 8–9 The Lac operon is controlled by two transcription regulators, 
the Lac repressor and Cap. When lactose is absent, the Lac repressor binds 
to the Lac operator and shuts off expression of the operon. addition of lactose 
increases the intracellular concentration of a related compound, allolactose; 
allolactose binds to the Lac repressor, causing it to undergo a conformational 
change that releases its grip on the operator DNa (not shown). When glucose is 
absent, cyclic aMp (red triangle) is produced by the cell, and cap binds to DNa. 
LacZ, the first gene of the operon, encodes the enzyme β-galactosidase, which 
breaks down lactose to galactose and glucose.

indicate how, through such contacts, 
a protein can distinguish a t-A from 
a c-g pair. indicate the parts of the 
nucleotide base pairs that could 
form noncovalent interactions—
hydrogen bonds, electrostatic 
attractions, or hydrophobic 
interactions (see panel 2–7,  
pp. 78–79)—with a dnA-binding 
protein. the structures of all the 
base pairs in dnA are given in 
figure 5–6.

Figure 8–10 In eukaryotes, gene 
activation can occur at a distance. 
an activator protein bound to a distant 
enhancer attracts rNa polymerase 
and general transcription factors to the 
promoter. Looping of the intervening DNa 
permits contact between the activator and 
the transcription initiation complex bound 
to the promoter. In the case shown here, 
a large protein complex called Mediator 
serves as a go-between. the broken stretch 
of DNa signifies that the length of DNa 
between the enhancer and the start of 
transcription varies, sometimes reaching 
tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs in 
length. the tata box is a DNa recognition 
sequence for the first general transcription 
factor that binds to the promoter (see 
Figure 7–12).

eukaryotic transcription regulators control gene 
expression from a distance
Eukaryotes,  too,  use  transcription  regulators—both  activators  and 
repressors—to regulate the expression of their genes. The DNA sites to 
which  eukaryotic  gene  activators  bind  are  termed  enhancers,  because 
their  presence  dramatically  enhances  the  rate  of  transcription.  It  was 
surprising to biologists when, in 1979, it was discovered that these acti-
vator  proteins  could  enhance  transcription  even  when  they  are  bound 
thousands of nucleotide pairs away from a gene’s promoter. They also 
work when bound either upstream or downstream from the gene. These 
observations raised several questions. How do enhancer sequences and 
the proteins bound to them function over such long distances? How do 
they communicate with the promoter? 

Many models for this “action at a distance” have been proposed, but the 
simplest of these seems to apply in most cases. The DNA between the 
enhancer and the promoter loops out to allow eukaryotic activator pro-
teins to influence directly events that take place at the promoter (Figure 
8–10). The DNA thus acts as a tether, allowing a protein that is bound 
to an enhancer—even one that is thousands of nucleotide pairs away—
to  interact  with  the  proteins  in  the  vicinity  of  the  promoter—including 
RNA polymerase and the general transcription factors (see Figure 7–12). 
Often, additional proteins serve to link the distantly bound transcription 
regulators to these proteins at the promoter; the most important of these 
regulators is a large complex of proteins known as Mediator (see Figure 
8–10). One of the ways in which these proteins function is by aiding the 
assembly  of  the  general  transcription  factors  and  RNA  polymerase  to 
form a large transcription complex at the promoter. Eukaryotic repressor 
proteins do the opposite: they decrease transcription by preventing the 
assembly of the same protein complex.

In addition to promoting—or repressing—the assembly of a transcription 
initiation  complex  directly,  eukaryotic  transcription  regulators  have  an 
additional mechanism of action: they attract proteins that modify chro-
matin structure and thereby affect the accessibility of the promoter to the 
general transcription factors and RNA polymerase, as we discuss next.

eukaryotic transcription regulators help initiate 
transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying proteins
Initiation of transcription in eukaryotic cells must also take into account 
the  packaging  of  DNA  into  chromosomes.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  5, 
eukaryotic DNA is packed into nucleosomes, which, in turn, are folded 
into  higher-order  structures.  How  do  transcription  regulators,  general 
transcription  factors,  and  RNA  polymerase  gain  access  to  such  DNA? 
Nucleosomes can inhibit the initiation of transcription if they are posi-
tioned over a promoter, because they physically block the assembly of 
the  general  transcription  factors  or  RNA  polymerase  on  the  promoter. 
Such  chromatin  packaging  may  have  evolved  in  part  to  prevent  leaky 
gene expression by blocking the initiation of transcription in the absence 
of the proper activator proteins.

In  eukaryotic  cells,  activator  and  repressor  proteins  exploit  chromatin 
structure to help turn genes on and off. As we saw in Chapter 5, chroma-
tin  structure  can  be  altered  by  chromatin-remodeling  complexes  and  by 
enzymes that covalently modify the histone proteins that form the core of 
the nucleosome (see Figures 5–26 and 5–27). Many gene activators take 
advantage of these mechanisms by recruiting such chromatin-modifying 
proteins  to  promoters.  For  example,  the  recruitment  of  histone  acetyl-
transferases promotes the attachment of acetyl groups to selected lysines 
in the tail of histone proteins. This modification alters chromatin struc-
ture, allowing greater accessibility to the underlying DNA; moreover, the 
acetyl  groups  themselves  attract  proteins  that  promote  transcription, 
including some of the general transcription factors (Figure 8–11). 

Likewise,  gene  repressor  proteins  can  modify  chromatin  in  ways  that 
reduce the efficiency of transcription initiation. For example, many repres-
sors attract histone deacetylases—enzymes that remove the acetyl groups 
from histone tails, thereby reversing the positive effects that acetylation 
has on transcription initiation. Although some eukaryotic repressor pro-
teins work on a gene-by-gene basis, others can orchestrate the formation 
of large swathes of transcriptionally inactive chromatin containing many

Question 8–3

some transcription regulators bind 
to dnA and cause the double helix 
to bend at a sharp angle. such 
“bending proteins” can stimulate 
the initiation of transcription 
without contacting either the rnA 
polymerase, any of the general 
transcription factors, or any other 
transcription regulators. can you 
devise a plausible explanation for 
how these proteins might work 
to modulate transcription? draw 
a diagram that illustrates your 
explanation.

Figure 8–11 Eukaryotic transcriptional 
activators can recruit chromatin-
modifying proteins to help initiate gene 
transcription. On the right, chromatin-
remodeling complexes render the DNa 
packaged in chromatin more accessible to 
other proteins in the cell, including those 
required for transcription initiation; notice, 
for example, the increased exposure of the 
tata box. On the left, the recruitment of 
histone-modifying enzymes such as histone 
acetyltransferases adds acetyl groups to 
specific histones, which can then serve as 
binding sites for proteins that stimulate 
transcription initiation (not shown).

DNA include the heterochromatin found in interphase chromosomes and 
the inactive X chromosome in the cells of female mammals. 

the moleculAr mechAnisms thAt creAte 
speciAlized cell types
All cells must be able to switch genes on and off in response to signals in 
their environment. But the cells of multicellular organisms have evolved 
this capacity to an extreme degree and in highly specialized ways to form 
organized arrays of differentiated cell types. In particular, once a cell in a 
multicellular organism becomes committed to differentiate into a specific 
cell type, the choice of fate is generally maintained through subsequent 
cell divisions. This means that the changes in gene expression, which are 
often triggered by a transient signal, must be remembered by the cell. This 
phenomenon of cell memory is a prerequisite for the creation of organ-
ized tissues and for the maintenance of stably differentiated cell types. 
In contrast, the simplest changes in gene expression in both eukaryotes 
and bacteria are often only transient; the tryptophan repressor, for exam-
ple, switches off the tryptophan operon in bacteria only in the presence 
of tryptophan; as soon as the amino acid is removed from the medium, 
the genes switch back on, and the descendants of the cell will have no 
memory that their ancestors had been exposed to tryptophan.

In this section, we discuss some of the special features of transcriptional 
regulation  that  are  found  in  multicellular  organisms.  Our  focus  will  be 
on how these mechanisms create and maintain the specialized cell types 
that give a worm, a fly, or a human its distinctive characteristics.

eukaryotic genes Are controlled by combinations of 
transcription regulators
Because eukaryotic transcription regulators can control transcription ini-
tiation when bound to DNA many base pairs away from the promoter, the 
nucleotide sequences that control the expression of a gene can be spread 
over long stretches of DNA. In animals and plants, it is not unusual to 
find the regulatory DNA sequences of a gene dotted over tens of thou-
sands of nucleotide pairs, although much of the intervening DNA serves 
as “spacer” sequence and is not directly recognized by the transcription 
regulators. 

So far in this chapter, we have treated transcription regulators as though 
each functions individually to turn a gene on or off. While this idea holds 
true for many simple bacterial activators and repressors, most eukaryotic 
transcription regulators work as part of a “committee” of regulatory pro-
teins, all of which are necessary to express the gene in the right place, in 
the right cell type, in response to the right conditions, at the right time, 
and in the required amount.

The term combinatorial control refers to the way that groups of tran-
scription regulators work together to determine the expression of a single 
gene. We saw a simple example of such regulation by multiple regula-
tors  when  we  discussed  the  bacterial  Lac  operon  (see  Figure  8–9).  In 
eukaryotes, the regulatory inputs have been amplified, and a typical gene 
is  controlled  by  dozens  of  transcription  regulators.  These  help  assem-
ble  chromatin-remodeling  complexes,  histone-modifying  enzymes, 
RNA polymerase, and general transcription factors via the multiprotein 
Mediator  complex  (Figure  8–12).  In  many  cases,  both  repressors  and 
activators will be present in the same complex; how the cell integrates 
the  effects  of  all  of  these  proteins  to  determine  the  final  level  of  gene

Figure 8–12 Transcription regulators 
work together as a “committee” to 
control the expression of a eukaryotic 
gene. Whereas the general transcription 
factors that assemble at the promoter 
are the same for all genes transcribed by 
rNa polymerase (see Figure 7–12), the 
transcription regulators and the locations 
of their DNa binding sites relative to the 
promoters are different for different genes. 
these regulators, along with chromatin-
modifying proteins, are assembled at the 
promoter by the Mediator. the effects of 
multiple transcription regulators combine 
to determine the final rate of transcription 
initiation. 

expression is only now beginning to be understood. An example of such 
a  complex  regulatory  system—one  that  participates  in  the  develop-
ment of a fruit fly from a fertilized egg—is described in How We Know, 
pp. 274–275.

the expression of different genes can Be coordinated by 
a single protein
In addition to being able to switch individual genes on and off, all cells—
whether prokaryote or eukaryote—need to coordinate the expression of 
different  genes.  When  a  eukaryotic  cell  receives  a  signal  to  divide,  for 
example, a number of hitherto unexpressed genes are turned on together 
to set in motion the events that lead eventually to cell division (discussed 
in Chapter 18). As discussed earlier, one way in which bacteria coordi-
nate the expression of a set of genes is by having them clustered together 
in  an  operon  under  the  control  of  a  single  promoter  (see  Figure  8–6). 
Such clustering is not seen in eukaryotic cells, where each gene is tran-
scribed and regulated individually. So how do these cells coordinate gene 
expression? In particular, given that a eukaryotic cell uses a committee 
of transcription regulators to control each of its genes, how can it rapidly 
and decisively switch whole groups of genes on or off? 

ECB4 E8.12/8.12

The answer is that even though control of gene expression is combinato-
rial, the effect of a single transcription regulator can still be decisive in 
switching any particular gene on or off, simply by completing the com-
bination needed to activate or repress that gene. This is like dialing in 
the final number of a combination lock: the lock will spring open if the 
other numbers have been previously entered. Just as the same number 
can complete the combination for different locks, the same protein can 
complete the combination for several different genes. As long as differ-
ent genes contain regulatory DNA sequences that are recognized by the 
same transcription regulator, they can be switched on or off together, as 
a coordinated unit. 

An example of such coordinated regulation in humans is seen with the 
cortisol receptor protein. In order to bind to regulatory sites in DNA, this

GENE rEGuLaTIoN—THE sTory oF eve

The  ability  to  regulate  gene  expression  is  crucial  to 
the  proper  development  of  a  multicellular  organism 
from a fertilized egg to a fertile adult. Beginning at the 
earliest moments in development, a succession of tran-
scriptional  programs  guides  the  differential  expression 
of  genes  that  allows  an  animal  to  form  a  proper  body 
plan—helping to distinguish its back from its belly, and 
its head from its tail. These programs ultimately direct 
the correct placement of a wing or a leg, a mouth or an 
anus, a neuron or a sex cell.

A central challenge in development, then, is to under-
stand  how  an  organism  generates  these  patterns  of 
gene  expression,  which  are  laid  down  within  hours  of 
fertilization. Among the most important genes involved 
in  these  early  stages  of  development  are  those  that 
encode transcription regulators. By interacting with dif-
ferent regulatory DNA sequences, these proteins instruct 
every cell in the embryo to switch on the genes that are 
appropriate for that cell at each time point during devel-
opment. How can a protein binding to a piece of DNA 
help direct the development of a complex multicellular 
organism? To see how we can address that large ques-
tion, we review the story of Eve.

seeing Eve 
Even-skipped—Eve,  for  short—is  a  gene  whose  expres-
sion plays an important part in the development of the 
Drosophila embryo. If this gene is inactivated by muta-
tion, many parts of the embryo fail to form and the fly 
larva dies early in development. But Eve is not expressed 
uniformly throughout the embryo. Instead, the Eve pro-
tein is produced in a striking series of seven neat stripes, 
each of which occupies a very precise position along the 
length of the embryo. These seven stripes correspond to 
seven of the fourteen segments that define the body plan 
of the fly—three for the head, three for the thorax, and 
eight for the abdomen. 

This pattern never varies: Eve can be found in the very 
same  places  in  every  Drosophila  embryo  (see  Figure 
8–13B). How can the expression of a gene be regulated 
with such spatial precision—such that one cell will pro-
duce a protein while a neighboring cell does not? To find 
out, researchers took a trip upstream.

dissecting the dnA
As  we  have  seen  in  this  chapter,  regulatory  DNA 
sequences  control  which  cells  in  an  organism  will 
express  a  particular  gene,  and  at  what  point  during 
development that gene will be turned on. In eukaryotes, 

these  regulatory  sequences  are  frequently  located 
upstream of the gene itself. One way to locate a regu-
latory  DNA  sequence—and  study  how  it  operates—is 
to  remove  a  piece  of  DNA  from  the  region  upstream 
of  a  gene  of  interest  and  insert  that  DNA  upstream  of 
a  reporter  gene—one  that  encodes  a  protein  with  an 
activity  that  is  easy  to  monitor  experimentally.  If  the 
piece  of  DNA  contains  a  regulatory  sequence,  it  will 
drive  the  expression  of  the  reporter  gene.  When  this 
patchwork piece of DNA is subsequently introduced into 
a cell or organism, the reporter gene will be expressed 
in the same cells and tissues that normally express the 
gene from which the regulatory sequence was derived 
(see Figure 10–31).

By  excising  various  segments  of  the  DNA  sequences 
upstream of Eve, and coupling them to a reporter gene, 
researchers  found  that  the  expression  of  the  gene  is 
controlled  by  a  series  of  seven  regulatory  modules—
each of which specifies a single stripe of Eve expression. 
In  this  way,  researchers  identified,  for  example,  a  sin-
gle  segment  of  regulatory  DNA  that  specifies  stripe  2. 
They  could  excise  this  regulatory  segment,  link  it  to  a 
reporter gene, and introduce the resulting DNA segment 
into the fly. When they examined embryos that carried 
this engineered DNA, they found that the reporter gene 
is  expressed  in  the  precise  position  of  stripe  2  (Figure 
8–13). Similar experiments revealed the existence of six 
other regulatory modules, one for each of the other Eve 
stripes.

The next question is: How does each of these seven reg-
ulatory segments direct the formation of a single stripe 
in  a  specific  position?  The  answer,  researchers  found, 
is  that  each  segment  contains  a  unique  combination 
of  regulatory  sequences  that  bind  different  combina-
tions of transcription regulators. These regulators, like 
Eve itself, are distributed in unique patterns within the 
embryo—some toward the head, some toward the rear, 
some in the middle. 

The  regulatory  segment  that  defines  stripe  2,  for 
example,  contains  regulatory  DNA  sequences  for  four 
transcription regulators: two that activate Eve transcrip-
tion and two that repress it (Figure 8–14). In the narrow 
band of tissue that constitutes stripe 2, it just so happens 
the repressor proteins are not present—so the Eve gene 
is expressed; in the bands of tissue on either side of the 
stripe, the repressors keep Eve quiet. And so a stripe is 
formed.
The  regulatory  segments  controlling  the  other  stripes 
are thought to function along similar lines; each regu-
latory segment reads “positional information” provided

in the position of the second Eve stripe. enzyme activity is assayed by the addition of X-gal, a modified sugar that when 
cleaved by β-galactosidase generates an insoluble blue product. (B and D, courtesy of Stephen Small and Michael

by  some  unique  combination  of  transcription  regula-
tors  in  the  embryo  and  expresses  Eve  on  the  basis  of 
this information. The entire regulatory region is strung 
out over 20,000 nucleotide pairs of DNA and, altogether, 
binds more than 20 transcription regulators. This large 
regulatory  region  is  built  from  a  series  of  smaller  reg-
ulatory  segments,  each  of  which  consists  of  a  unique 
arrangement  of  regulatory  DNA  sequences  recognized 
by  specific  transcription  regulators.  In  this  way,  the 

Eve gene can respond to an enormous combination of 
inputs. 

The  Eve  protein  is  itself  a  transcription  regulator,  and 
it—in  combination  with  many  other  regulatory  pro-
teins—controls key events in the development of the fly. 
This complex organization of a discrete number of regu-
latory elements begins to explain how the development 
of an entire organism can be orchestrated by repeated 
applications of a few basic principles.

as indicated in the diagram, in some cases the binding sites for the transcription regulators overlap, and the proteins 
compete for binding to the DNa. For example, the binding of Bicoid and Krüppel to the site at the far right is thought to 
be mutually exclusive. the regulatory segment is 480 base pairs in length.

transcription regulator must first form a complex with a molecule of corti-
sol (see Table 16–1, p. 529). In response to cortisol, liver cells increase the 
expression of many genes, one of which encodes the enzyme tyrosine 
aminotransferase, as discussed earlier. All these genes are regulated by 
the binding of the cortisol–receptor complex to a regulatory sequence in 
the DNA of each gene. When the cortisol concentration decreases again, 
the expression of all of these genes drops to its normal level. In this way, 
a single transcription regulator can coordinate the expression of many 
different genes (Figure 8–15).

ECB4 e8.17/8.15

combinatorial control can Also generate different cell 
types
The ability to switch many different genes on or off using a limited number 
of transcription regulators is not only useful in the day-to-day regulation 
of  cell  function.  It  is  also  one  of  the  means  by  which  eukaryotic  cells 
diversify  into  particular  types  of  cells  during  embryonic  development. 
A  striking  example  is  the  development  of  muscle  cells.  A  mammalian 
skeletal muscle cell is distinguished from other cells by the production 
of a large number of characteristic proteins, such as the muscle-specific 
forms of actin and myosin that make up the contractile apparatus (dis-
cussed in Chapter 17), as well as the receptor proteins and ion channel 
proteins in the plasma membrane that make the muscle cell sensitive to 
nerve stimulation. The genes encoding these muscle-specific proteins are 
all switched on coordinately as the muscle cell differentiates. Studies of 
developing muscle cells in culture have identified a small number of key 
transcription  regulators,  expressed  only  in  potential  muscle  cells,  that 
coordinate muscle-specific gene expression and are thus crucial for mus-
cle-cell differentiation. This set of regulators activates the transcription 
of the genes that code for muscle-specific proteins by binding to specific 
DNA sequences present in their regulatory regions. 

Some transcription regulators can even convert one specialized cell type 
to another. For example, when the gene encoding the transcription regu-
lator  MyoD  is  artificially  introduced  into  fibroblasts  cultured  from  skin

connective  tissue,  the  fibroblasts  form  musclelike  cells.  It  appears  that 
the fibroblasts, which are derived from the same broad class of embry-
onic cells as muscle cells, have already accumulated many of the other 
necessary transcription regulators required for the combinatorial control 
of the muscle-specific genes, and that addition of MyoD completes the 
unique combination required to direct the cells to become muscle.

This type of reprogramming can produce even more dramatic effects. For 
example, a set of nerve-specific transcription regulators, when artificially 
expressed in cultured liver cells, can convert them into functional neu-
rons (Figure 8–16). Such dramatic results suggest that it may someday 
be possible to produce in the laboratory any cell type for which the cor-
rect combination of transcription regulators can be identified. How these 
transcription regulators can then lead to the generation of different cell 
types is illustrated schematically in Figure 8–17.

specialized cell types can Be experimentally 
reprogrammed to Become pluripotent stem cells
We have seen that, in some cases, one type of differentiated cell can be 
experimentally converted into another type by the artificial expression of 
specific transcription regulators (see Figure 8–16). Even more surprising, 
transcription regulators can coax various differentiated cells to de-differ-
entiate into pluripotent stem cells that are capable of giving rise to all 
the specialized cell types in the body, much like the embryonic stem (ES) 
cells discussed in Chapter 20 (see pp. 708–711). 

Using a defined set of transcription regulators, cultured mouse fibroblasts 
have  been  reprogrammed  to  become  induced  pluripotent  stem  (iPS) 
cells—cells  that  look  and  behave  like  the  pluripotent  ES  cells  that  are 
derived from embryos (Figure 8–18). The approach was quickly adapted 
to produce iPS cells from a variety of specialized cell types, including cells 
taken from humans. Such human iPS cells can then be directed to gener-
ate a population of differentiated cells for use in the study or treatment of 
disease, as we discuss in Chapter 20.

the formation of an entire organ can Be triggered  
by a single transcription regulator
We have seen that a small number of transcription regulators can control 
the expression of whole sets of genes and can even convert one cell type 
into another. But an even more stunning example of the power of tran-
scriptional control comes from studies of eye development in Drosophila. 
In this case, a single “master” transcription regulator called Ey could be 
used to trigger the formation of not just a single cell type but a whole 
organ. In the laboratory, the Ey gene can be artificially expressed in fruit 
fly embryos in cells that would normally give rise to a leg. When these 
modified embryos develop into adult flies, some have an eye in the middle 
of a leg (Figure 8–19). 

How the Ey protein coordinates the specification of each type of cell found 
in  the  eye—and  directs  their  proper  organization  in  three-dimensional 
space—is an actively studied topic in developmental biology. In essence, 
however, Ey functions like any other transcription regulator, controlling 
the expression of multiple genes by binding to DNA sequences in their 
regulatory regions. Some of the genes controlled by Ey encode additional 
transcription  regulators  that,  in  turn,  control  the  expression  of  other 
genes. In this way, the action of a single transcription regulator can pro-
duce a cascade of regulators that, working in combination, lead to the 
formation of an organized group of many different types of cells. One can 
begin to imagine how, by repeated applications of this principle, a com-
plex organism self-assembles, piece by piece. 

the Molecular Mechanisms that create Specialized cell types         

279

epigenetic mechanisms Allow differentiated cells to 
maintain their identity
Once a cell has become differentiated into a particular cell type, it will 
generally remain differentiated, and all its progeny cells will remain that 
same cell type. Some highly specialized cells, including skeletal muscle 
cells and neurons, never divide again once they have differentiated—that 
is, they are terminally differentiated (as discussed in Chapter 18). But many 
other differentiated cells—such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and 
liver cells—will divide many times in the life of an individual. When they 
do,  these  specialized  cell  types  give  rise  only  to  cells  like  themselves: 
smooth  muscle  cells  do  not  give  rise  to  liver  cells,  nor  liver  cells  to 
fibroblasts. 

For  a  proliferating  cell  to  maintain  its  identity—a  property  called  cell 
memory—the  patterns  of  gene  expression  responsible  for  that  identity 
must be remembered and passed on to its daughter cells through all sub-
sequent cell divisions. Thus, in the model illustrated in Figure 8–17, the 
production of each transcription regulator, once begun, has to be contin-
ued in the daughter cells of each cell division. How is such perpetuation 
accomplished?

Cells  have  several  ways  of  ensuring  that  their  daughters  “remember” 
what kind of cells they are. One of the simplest and most important is 
through a positive feedback loop, where a master transcription regula-
tor  activates  transcription  of  its  own  gene,  in  addition  to  that  of  other 
cell-type–specific genes. Each time a cell divides the regulator is distrib-
uted to both daughter cells, where it continues to stimulate the positive 
feedback loop. The continued stimulation ensures that the regulator will 
continue to be produced in subsequent cell generations. The Ey protein 
discussed  earlier  functions  in  such  a  positive  feedback  loop.  Positive 
feedback is crucial for establishing the “self-sustaining” circuits of gene 
expression that allow a cell to commit to a particular fate—and then to 
transmit that information to its progeny (Figure 8–20). 

Although positive feedback loops are probably the most prevalent way of 
ensuring that daughter cells remember what kind of cells they are meant 
to be, there are other ways of reinforcing cell identity. One involves the 
methylation of DNA. In vertebrate cells, DNA methylation occurs on cer-
tain  cytosine  bases  (Figure  8–21).  This  covalent  modification  generally

turns off genes by attracting proteins that bind to methylated cytosines 
and block gene transcription. DNA methylation patterns are passed on 
to progeny cells by the action of an enzyme that copies the methylation 
pattern on the parent DNA strand to the daughter DNA strand as it is syn-
thesized (Figure 8–22). 

Another mechanism for inheriting gene expression patterns involves the 
modification of histones. When a cell replicates its DNA, each daughter 
double helix receives half of its parent’s histone proteins, which contain 
the covalent modifications of the parent chromosome. Enzymes respon-
sible for these modifications may bind to the parental histones and confer 
the same modifications to the new histones nearby. This cycle of modi-
fication  reestablishes  the  pattern  of  chromatin  structure  found  in  the 
parent chromosome (Figure 8–23).

Because  all  of  these  cell-memory  mechanisms  transmit  patterns  of 
gene expression from parent to daughter cell without altering the actual 
nucleotide  sequence  of  the  DNA,  they  are  considered  to  be  forms  of  
epigenetic inheritance. Such epigenetic changes play an important part 
in  controlling  patterns  of  gene  expression,  allowing  transient  signals 
from  the  environment  to  be  permanently  recorded  by  our  cells—a  fact 
that has important implications for understanding how cells operate and 
how they malfunction in disease.

post-trAnscriptionAl controls
We  have  seen  that  transcription  regulators  control  gene  expression 
by promoting or hindering the transcription of specific genes. The vast 
majority of genes in all organisms are regulated in this way. But many 
additional points of control can come into play later in the pathway from 
DNA to protein, giving cells a further opportunity to regulate the amount 
or activity of the gene products that they make (see Figure 8–3). These 
post-transcriptional  controls,  which  operate  after  transcription  has 
begun, play a crucial part in regulating the expression of almost all genes. 

We  have  already  encountered  a  few  examples  of  such  post-transcript-
ional control. We have seen how alternative RNA splicing allows different

Figure 8–22 DNa methylation patterns can be faithfully inherited when a cell divides. an enzyme called a maintenance 
methyltransferase guarantees that once a pattern of DNa methylation has been established, it is inherited by newly made DNa. 
Immediately after DNa replication, each daughter double helix will contain one methylated DNa strand—inherited from the parent 
double helix—and one unmethylated, newly synthesized strand. the maintenance methyltransferase interacts with these hybrid double 
helices and methylates only those cG sequences that are base-paired with a cG sequence that is already methylated.

Figure 8–23 Histone modifications 
may be inherited by daughter 
chromosomes. When a chromosome 
is replicated, its resident histones are 
distributed more or less randomly 
to each of the two daughter DNa 
double helices. thus, each daughter 
chromosome will inherit about half of its 
parent’s collection of modified histones. 
the remaining stretches of DNa receive 
newly synthesized, not-yet-modified 
histones. If the enzymes responsible for 
each type of modification bind to the 
specific modification they create, they can 
catalyze the spread of this modification 
on the new histones. this cycle of 
modification and recognition can restore 
the parental histone modification pattern 
and, ultimately, allow the inheritance of 
the parental chromatin structure. this 
mechanism may apply to some but not all 
types of histone modifications.

tissues  (Figure  7–22).  And  we  have  discussed  how  various  post-trans-
lational  modifications  of  a  protein  can  regulate  its  concentration  and 
activity (see Figure 4–43). In the remainder of this chapter, we consider 
several  other  examples—some  only  recently  discovered—of  the  many 
ways in which cells can manipulate the expression of a gene after tran-
scription has commenced. 

ECB4 m5.32/8.23

each mrnA controls its own degradation and translation
The  more  time  an  mRNA  persists  in  the  cell  before  it  is  degraded,  the 
more protein it will produce. In bacteria, most mRNAs last only a few min-
utes before being destroyed. This instability allows a bacterium to adapt 
quickly to environmental changes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally more 
stable. The mRNA that encodes β-globin, for example, has a half-life of 
more than 10 hours. Most eukaryotic mRNAs, however, have half-lives 
of less than 30 minutes, and the most short-lived are those that encode 
proteins whose concentrations need to change rapidly based on the cell’s 
needs, such as transcription regulators. Whether bacterial or eukaryotic, 
an  mRNA’s  lifetime  is  dictated  by  specific  nucleotide  sequences  within 
the untranslated regions that lie both upstream and downstream of the 
protein-coding sequence. These sequences often harbor binding sites for 
proteins that are involved in RNA degradation.

In  addition  to  the  nucleotide  sequences  that  regulate  its  half-life,  each 
mRNA possesses sequences that help control how often or how efficiently 
it will be translated into protein. These sequences control translation ini-
tiation. Although the details differ between eukaryotes and bacteria, the 
general strategy is similar for both.

Bacterial  mRNAs  contain  a  short  ribosome-binding  sequence  located 
a  few  nucleotide  pairs  upstream  of  the  AUG  codon  where  translation 
begins (see Figure 7–37). This binding sequence forms base pairs with the 
RNA in the small ribosomal subunit, correctly positioning the initiating 
AUG codon within the ribosome. Because this interaction is needed for 
efficient translation initiation, it provides an ideal target for translational 
control. By blocking—or exposing—the ribosome-binding sequence, the 
bacterium  can  either  inhibit—or  promote—the  translation  of  an  mRNA 
(Figure 8–24).
Eukaryotic  mRNAs  possess  a  5′  cap  that  helps  guide  the  ribosome  to 
the  first  AUG,  the  codon  where  translation  will  start  (see  Figure  7–36). 
Eukaryotic  repressor  proteins  can  inhibit  translation  initiation  by  bind-
ing to specific nucleotide sequences in the 5′ untranslated region of the 
mRNA,  thereby  preventing  the  ribosome  from  finding  the  first  AUG—a 
mechanism similar to that in bacteria. When conditions change, the cell 
can inactivate the repressor to initiate translation of the mRNA.

Figure 8–24 a bacterial gene’s expression 
can be controlled by regulating 
translation of its mrNa. (a) Sequence-
specific rNa-binding proteins can repress 
the translation of specific mrNas by 
keeping the ribosome from binding to the 
ribosome-binding sequence (orange) in the 
mrNa. Some ribosomal proteins exploit 
this mechanism to inhibit the translation 
of their own mrNa. In this way, “extra” 
ribosomal proteins—those not incorporated 
into ribosomes—serve as a signal to halt 
their synthesis. (B) an mrNa from the 
pathogen Listeria monocytogenes contains 
a “thermosensor” rNa sequence that 
controls the translation of a set of mrNas 
produced by virulence genes. at the warmer 
temperature that the bacterium encounters 
inside its human host, the thermosensor 
sequence denatures, exposing the 
ribosome-binding sequence, so the 
virulence proteins are made. 

regulatory rnAs control the expression of thousands of 
genes
As  we  saw  in  Chapter  7,  RNAs  perform  many  critical  tasks  in  cells.  In 
addition to the mRNAs, which code for proteins, noncoding RNAs have 
various functions. It has long been known that some have key structural 
and  catalytic  roles,  particularly  in  protein  synthesis  by  ribosomes  (see 
pp. 246–247). But a recent series of surprising discoveries has revealed 
several new classes of noncoding RNAs and shown that these RNAs are 
far more prevalent than previously suspected. 

What, then, are all these newly discovered noncoding RNAs doing? Many 
have unanticipated but important roles in regulating gene expression and 
are  therefore  referred  to  as  regulatory  RNAs.  There  are  at  least  three 
major types of regulatory RNAs—microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and 
long noncoding RNAs. We discuss each one in turn. 

ECB4 e8.25/8.24

micrornAs direct the destruction of target mrnAs
MicroRNAs,  or  miRNAs,  are  tiny  RNA  molecules  that  control  gene 
expression  by  base-pairing  with  specific  mRNAs  and  reducing  both 
their stability and their translation into protein. In humans, miRNAs are 
thought  to  regulate  the  expression  of  at  least  one-third  of  all  protein-
coding genes. 

Like other noncoding RNAs, such as tRNA and rRNA, a precursor miRNA 
transcript  undergoes  a  special  type  of  processing  to  yield  the  mature, 
functional miRNA molecule, which is only about 22 nucleotides in length. 
This small but mature miRNA is packaged with specialized proteins to 
form  an  RNA-induced  silencing  complex  (RISC),  which  patrols  the  cyto-
plasm in search of mRNAs that are complementary to the bound miRNA  
molecule (Figure 8–25). Once a target mRNA forms base pairs with an 
miRNA, it is either destroyed immediately by a nuclease present within 
the RISC or its translation is blocked. In the latter case, the bound mRNA 
molecule is delivered to a region of the cytoplasm where other nucleases 
eventually  degrade  it.  Destruction  of  the  mRNA  releases  the  RISC  and 
allows it to seek out additional mRNA targets. Thus, a single miRNA—as 
part of a RISC—can eliminate one mRNA molecule after another, thereby 
efficiently blocking production of the protein that the mRNAs encode.

Two  features  of  miRNAs  make  them  especially  useful  regulators  of 
gene expression. First, a single miRNA can inhibit the transcription of a 
whole set of different mRNAs so long as all the mRNAs carry a common 
sequence,  usually  located  in  either  their  5′  or  3′  untranslated  regions. 
In humans, some individual miRNAs influence the transcription of hun-
dreds of different mRNAs in this manner. Second, a gene that encodes an 
miRNA occupies relatively little space in the genome compared with one 
that encodes a transcription regulator. Indeed, their very small size is one 
reason  that  miRNAs  were  discovered  only  recently.  There  are  thought

to  be  roughly  500  different  miRNAs  encoded  by  the  human  genome. 
Although we are only beginning to understand the full impact of these 
miRNAs, it is clear that they play a critical part in regulating gene expres-
sion and thereby influence many cell functions.

small interfering rnAs Are produced from double-
stranded, foreign rnAs to protect cells from infections
Some of the same components that process and package miRNAs also 
play  another  crucial  part  in  the  life  of  a  cell:  they  serve  as  a  powerful 
cell  defense  mechanism.  In  this  case,  the  system  is  used  to  eliminate 
“foreign” RNA molecules—in particular, the double-stranded RNAs pro-
duced by many viruses and transposable genetic elements (discussed in 
Chapter 9). The process is called RNA interference (RNAi). 

ECB4 e8.26/8.25

In the first step of RNAi, the double-stranded, foreign RNAs are cut into 
short fragments (approximately 22 nucleotide pairs in length) by a pro-
tein called Dicer—the same protein used to generate the double-stranded 
RNA  intermediate  in  miRNA  production  (see  Figure  8–25).  The  result-
ing  double-stranded  RNA  fragments,  called  small  interfering  RNAs 
(siRNAs), are then taken up by the same RISCs that carry miRNAs. The 
RISC  discards  one  strand  of  the  siRNA  duplex  and  uses  the  remaining 
single-stranded  RNA  to  seek  and  destroy  complementary  foreign  RNA 
molecules (Figure 8–26). In this way, the infected cell turns the foreign 
RNA back on itself.

RNAi  operates  in  a  wide  variety  of  organisms,  including  single-celled 
fungi, plants, and worms, indicating that it is an evolutionarily ancient 
defense  mechanism.  In  some  organisms,  including  plants,  the  RNAi 
defense  response  can  spread  from  tissue  to  tissue,  allowing  the  entire 
organism  to  become  resistant  to  a  virus  after  only  a  few  of  its  cells

transcript is processed to form a double-
stranded intermediate, which is further 
processed to form a mature, single-stranded 
mirNa. this mirNa assembles with a set 
of proteins into a complex called rISc, 
which then searches for mrNas that have 
a nucleotide sequence complementary 
to its bound mirNa. Depending on how 
extensive the region of complementarity is, 
the target mrNa is either rapidly degraded 
by a nuclease within the rISc or transferred 
to an area of the cytoplasm where other 
cellular nucleases destroy it.

have been infected. In this sense, RNAi resembles certain aspects of the 
adaptive  immune  responses  of  vertebrates;  in  both  cases,  an  invading 
pathogen elicits the production of molecules—either siRNAs or antibod-
ies—that are custom-made to inactivate the specific invader and thereby 
protect the host.

thousands of long noncoding rnAs may Also  
regulate mammalian gene Activity
At the other end of the size spectrum are the long noncoding RNAs, a 
class  of  RNA  molecules  that  are  more  than  200  nucleotides  in  length. 
There are thought to be upwards of 8000 of these RNAs encoded in the 
human and mouse genomes. Yet, with few exceptions, their roles in the 
biology of the organism are not entirely clear.

One of the best understood of the long noncoding RNAs is Xist. This enor-
mous RNA molecule, some 17,000 nucleotides long, is a key player in X 
inactivation—the process by which one of the two X chromosomes in the 
cells of female mammals is permanently silenced (see Figure 5–30). Early 
in development, Xist is produced by only one of the X chromosomes in 
each  female  nucleus.  The  transcript  then  “sticks  around,”  coating  the 
chromosome  and  presumably  attracting  the  enzymes  and  chromatin-
remodeling complexes that promote the formation of highly condensed 
heterochromatin. Other long noncoding RNAs may promote the silencing 
of specific genes in a similar manner. 

Some  long  noncoding  RNAs  arise  from  protein-coding  regions  of  the 
genome, but are transcribed from the “wrong” DNA strand. Some of these 
antisense transcripts are known to bind to the mRNAs produced from that 
DNA segment, regulating their translation and stability—in some cases 
by producing siRNAs (see Figure 8–26).

Regardless of how the various long noncoding RNAs operate—or what 
exactly they do—the discovery of this large class of RNAs reinforces the 
idea that a eukaryotic genome is densely packed with information that 
provides not only an inventory of the molecules and structures every cell 
must make, but a set of instructions for how and when to assemble these 
parts to guide the growth and development of a complete organism.

Questions
Question 8–4
A virus that grows in bacteria (bacterial viruses are called 
bacteriophages) can replicate in one of two ways. in the 
prophage state, the viral dnA is inserted into the bacterial 
chromosome and is copied along with the bacterial genome 
each time the cell divides. in the lytic state, the viral dnA 
is released from the bacterial chromosome and replicates 
many times in the cell. this viral dnA then produces 
viral coat proteins that together with the replicated viral 
dnA form many new virus particles that burst out of the 
bacterial cell. these two forms of growth are controlled by 
two transcription regulators, called c1 (“c one”) and cro, 
that are encoded by the virus. in the prophage state, ci is 
expressed; in the lytic state, cro is expressed. in addition to 
regulating the expression of other genes, c1 represses the 
Cro gene, and cro represses the c1 gene (Figure Q8–4). 
when bacteria containing a phage in the prophage state are 
briefly irradiated with uv light, c1 protein is degraded. 
A.  what will happen next?
B.  will the change in (A) be reversed when the uv light is 
switched off?
c.  why might this response to uv light have evolved?

Question 8–6
your task in the laboratory of professor Quasimodo is 
to determine how far an enhancer (a binding site for an 
activator protein) could be moved from the promoter 
of the straightspine gene and still activate transcription. 
you systematically vary the number of nucleotide pairs 
between these two sites and then determine the amount of 
transcription by measuring the production of straightspine 
mrnA. At first glance, your data look confusing (Figure 
Q8–6). what would you have expected for the results of 
this experiment? can you save your reputation and explain 
these results to professor Quasimodo?

which of the following statements are correct? explain your 
answers.
A.  in bacteria, but not in eukaryotes, many mrnAs contain

the coding region for more than one gene.
B.  most dnA-binding proteins bind to the major groove of 
the dnA double helix.
c.  of the major control points in gene expression 
(transcription, rnA processing, rnA transport, translation, 
and control of a protein’s activity), transcription initiation is 
one of the most common.

ECB4 EQ8.07/Q8.07

Question 8–7
the λ repressor binds as a dimer to critical sites on the λ 
genome to repress the virus’s lytic genes. this is necessary 
to maintain the prophage (integrated) state. each molecule 
of the repressor consists of an n-terminal dnA-binding 
domain and a c-terminal dimerization domain (Figure 
Q8–7). upon induction (for example, by irradiation with 
uv light), the genes for lytic growth are expressed, λ 
progeny are produced, and the bacterial cell is lysed (see 
Question 8–4). induction is initiated by cleavage of the 
λ repressor at a site between the dnA-binding domain 
and the dimerization domain, which causes the repressor 
to dissociate from the dnA. in the absence of bound 
repressor, rnA polymerase binds and initiates lytic growth. 
given that the number (concentration) of dnA-binding 
domains is unchanged by cleavage of the repressor, why do 
you suppose its cleavage results in its dissociation from the 
dnA?

the genes that encode the enzymes for arginine 
biosynthesis are located at several positions around the 
genome of E. coli, and they are regulated coordinately 
by a transcription regulator encoded by the ArgR gene.

the activity of the Argr protein is modulated by arginine. 
upon binding arginine, Argr alters its conformation, 
dramatically changing its affinity for the dnA sequences in 
the promoters of the genes for the arginine biosynthetic 
enzymes. given that Argr is a repressor protein, would you 
expect that Argr would bind more tightly or less tightly 
to the dnA sequences when arginine is abundant? if Argr 
functioned instead as an activator protein, would you expect 
the binding of arginine to increase or to decrease its affinity 
for its regulatory dnA sequences? explain your answers.

Question 8–12
imagine the two situations shown in Figure Q8–12. in 
cell i, a transient signal induces the synthesis of protein 
A, which is a transcriptional activator that turns on many 
genes including its own. in cell ii, a transient signal induces 
the synthesis of protein r, which is a transcriptional 
repressor that turns off many genes including its own. in 
which, if either, of these situations will the descendants of 
the original cell “remember” that the progenitor cell had 
experienced the transient signal? explain your reasoning.

Question 8–13
discuss the following argument: “if the expression of every 
gene depends on a set of transcription regulators, then the 
expression of these regulators must also depend on the 
expression of other regulators, and their expression must 
depend on the expression of still other regulators, and so 
on. cells would therefore need an infinite number of genes, 
most of which would code for transcription regulators.” 
how does the cell get by without having to achieve the 
impossible?

Question 8–9
when enhancers were initially found to influence 
transcription many thousands of nucleotide pairs from 
the promoters they control, two principal models were 
invoked to explain this action at a distance. in the “dnA 
looping” model, direct interactions between proteins bound 
at enhancers and promoters were proposed to stimulate 
transcription initiation. in the “scanning” or “entry-site” 
model, rnA polymerase (or another component of the 
transcription machinery) was proposed to bind at the 
enhancer and then scan along the dnA until it reached the 
promoter. these two models were tested using an enhancer 
on one piece of dnA and a β-globin gene and promoter on 
a separate piece of dnA (Figure Q8–9). the β-globin gene 
was not expressed from the mixture of pieces. however, 
when the two segments of dnA were joined via a linker 
(made of a protein that binds to a small molecule called 
biotin), the β-globin gene was expressed.
   does this experiment distinguish between the dnA 
looping model and the scanning model? explain your 
answer.

differentiated cells of an organism contain the same genes.

genome.) describe an experiment that substantiates the

Question 8–11
figure 8–17 shows a simple scheme by which three 
transcription regulators are used during development 
to create eight different cell types. how many cell types 
could you create, using the same rules, with four different 
transcription regulators? As described in the text, myod is 
a transcription regulator that by itself is sufficient to induce 
muscle-specific gene expression in fibroblasts. how does 
this observation fit the scheme in figure 8–17?

How Genes and Genomes 
evolve

For a given individual, the nucleotide sequence of the genome in virtually 
every one of its cells is the same. But compare the DNA of two individu-
als—even parent and child—and that is no longer the case: the genomes 
of individuals within a species contain slightly different information. And 
between  members  of  different  species,  the  deviations  are  even  more 
extensive.  

Such differences in DNA sequence are responsible for the diversity of life 
on Earth, from the subtle variations in hair color, eye color, and skin color 
that characterize members our own species (Figure 9–1) to the dramatic 
differences in phenotype that distinguish a fish from a fungus or a robin 
from a rose. But if all life emerged from a common ancestor—a single-
celled organism that existed some 3.5 billion years ago—where did these 
genetic improvisations come from? How did they arise, why were they 
preserved,  and  how  do  they  contribute  to  the  breathtaking  biological 
diversity that surrounds us?

Improvements  in  the  methods  used  to  sequence  and  analyze  whole 
genomes—from  pufferfish  and  the  plague  bacterium  to  people  from 
around the world—are now allowing us to address some of these ques-
tions. In Chapter 10, we describe these revolutionary technologies, which 
continue to transform the modern era of genomics. In this chapter, we 
present some of the fruits of these technological innovations. Our ability 
to compare the genomes of a wide-ranging collection of organisms has 
provided  striking confirmation of Darwin’s explanations for the diversity 
of life on Earth—revealing how processes of mutation and natural selec-
tion have been sculpting DNA sequences for billions of years, giving rise 
to the spectacular menagerie of present-day life-forms that crowd every 
corner of the planet.

ECB4 e9.01/9.01

In this chapter, we discuss how genes and genomes change over time. 
We  examine  the  molecular  mechanisms  that  generate  genetic  diver-
sity, and we consider how the information in present-day genomes can 
be deciphered to yield a historical record of the evolutionary processes 
that have shaped these DNA sequences. We take a brief look at mobile 
genetic elements and consider how these elements, along with modern-
day viruses, can carry genetic information from place to place and from 
organism to organism. Finally, we end the chapter by taking a closer look 
at the human genome to see what our own DNA sequences tell us about 
who we are and where we come from.

GENERATING GENETIC VARIATION
Evolution is more a tinkerer than an inventor: it uses as its raw materi-
als the DNA sequences that each organism inherits from its ancestors. 
There  is  no  natural  mechanism  for  making  long  stretches  of  entirely 
novel  nucleotide  sequences.  In  this  sense,  no  gene  or  genome  is  ever 
entirely new. Instead, the astonishing diversity in form and function in 
the living world is all the result of variations on preexisting themes. As 
genetic variations pile up over millions of generations, they can produce 
radical change. 

Several basic types of genetic change are especially crucial in evolution 
(Figure 9–2):

•	 Mutation  within  a  gene:  An  existing  gene  can  be  modified  by  a 
mutation that changes a single nucleotide or deletes or duplicates 
one  or  more  nucleotides.  These  mutations  can  alter  the  splicing 
of a gene’s transcript or change the stability, activity, location, or 
interactions of its encoded protein or RNA product. 

•	 Mutation  within  regulatory  DNA:  When  and  where  a  gene  is 
expressed can be affected by a mutation in the stretches of DNA 
sequence that regulate the gene’s activity (described in Chapter 8). 
For example, humans and fish have a surprisingly large number of 
genes in common, but changes in the regulation of those shared 
genes  underlie  many  of  the  most  dramatic  differences  between 
those species. 

•	 Gene  duplication:  An  existing  gene,  a  larger  segment  of  DNA,  or 
even a whole genome can be duplicated, creating a set of closely 
related  genes  within  a  single  cell.  As  this  cell  and  its  progeny 
divide,  the  original  DNA  sequence  and  its  duplicate  can  acquire 
additional mutations and thereby assume new functions and pat-
terns of expression.

•	 Exon  shuffling:  Two  or  more  existing  genes  can  be  broken  and 
rejoined  to  make  a  hybrid  gene  containing  DNA  segments  that 
originally belonged to separate genes. In eukaryotes, the breaking 
and rejoining often occurs within the long intron sequences, which 
do not encode protein. Because intron sequences are removed by 
RNA splicing, the breaking and joining do not have to be precise to 
result in a functional gene.

•	 Mobile genetic elements: Specialized DNA sequences that can move 
from one chromosomal location to another can alter the activity or 
regulation of a gene; they can also promote gene duplication, exon 
shuffling, and other genome rearrangements. 

•	 Horizontal gene transfer: A piece of DNA can be transferred from 
the genome of one cell to that of another—even to that of another 
species. This process, which is rare among eukaryotes but com-
mon among bacteria, differs from the usual “vertical” transfer of 
genetic information from parent to progeny. 

Generating Genetic Variation         

291

Figure 9–2 Genes and genomes can be 
altered by several different mechanisms. 
Small mutations, duplications, deletions, 
rearrangements, and even the infusion 
of fresh genetic material all contribute to 
genome evolution. although the mobile 
genetic element here is shown interrupting 
a gene regulatory sequence, the movement 
of these parasitic elements can promote 
a variety of genetic variations, including 
gene duplication, exon shuffling, and other 
regulatory and structural alterations.

Each of these forms of genetic variation—from the simple mutations that 
occur within a gene to the more extensive duplications, deletions, rear-
rangements, and additions that occur within a genome—has played an 
important part in the evolution of modern organisms. And they still play 
that part today, as organisms continue to evolve. In this section, we dis-
cuss these basic mechanisms of genetic change, and we consider their 
consequences for genome evolution. But first, we pause to consider the 
contribution  of  sex—the  mechanism  that  many  organisms  use  to  pass 
genetic information on to future generations.

ECB4 e9.02/9.02

In sexually Reproducing Organisms, Only Changes to the 
Germ line Are Passed On To Progeny
For bacteria and unicellular organisms that reproduce mainly asexually, 
the inheritance of genetic information is fairly straightforward. Each indi-
vidual duplicates its genome and donates one copy to each daughter cell 
when  the  individual  divides  in  two.  The  family  tree  of  such  unicellular 
organisms  is  simply  a  branching  diagram  of  cell  divisions  that  directly 
links each individual to its progeny and to its ancestors. 

QuEsTION 9–1

In this chapter, it is argued that 
genetic variability is beneficial for 
a species because it enhances that 
species’ ability to adapt to changing 
conditions. Why, then, do you think 
that cells go to such great lengths 
to ensure the fidelity of DNA 
replication?

292 

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

Figure 9–3 Germ-line cells and somatic 
cells have fundamentally different 
functions. In sexually reproducing 
organisms, genetic information is 
propagated into the next generation 
exclusively by germ-line cells (red). this 
cell lineage includes the specialized 
reproductive cells—the germ cells (eggs 
and sperm, red half circles)—which contain 
only half the number of chromosomes than 
do the other cells in the body (full circles). 
When two germ cells come together during 
fertilization, they form a fertilized egg or 
zygote (purple), which once again contains 
a full set of chromosomes (discussed in 
chapter 19). the zygote gives rise to both 
germ-line cells and to somatic cells (blue). 
Somatic cells form the body of the organism 
but do not contribute their DNa to the next 
generation.  

Figure 9–4 Mutations in germ-line 
cells and somatic cells have different 
consequences. a mutation that occurs 
in a germ-line cell (a) can be passed on 
to the cell’s progeny and, ultimately, to 
the progeny of the organism (green). By 
contrast, a mutation that arises in a somatic 
cell (B) affects only the progeny of that 
cell (orange) and will not be passed on 
to the organism’s progeny. as we discuss 
in chapter 20, somatic mutations are 
responsible for most human cancers (see  
pp. 714–717).

For a multicellular organism that reproduces sexually, however, the fam-
ily connections are considerably more complex. Although individual cells 
within  that  organism  divide,  only  the  specialized  reproductive  cells—
the  germ  cells—carry  a  copy  of  its  genome  to  the  next  generation  of 
organisms (discussed in Chapter 19). All the other cells of the body—the 
somatic cells—are doomed to die without leaving evolutionary descend-
ants of their own (Figure 9–3). In a sense, somatic cells exist only to help 
the germ cells survive and propagate.

ECB4 e9.03/9.03

A mutation that occurs in a somatic cell—although it might have unfortu-
nate consequences for the individual in which it occurs (causing cancer, 
for example)—will not be transmitted to the organism’s offspring. For a 
mutation to be passed on to the next generation, it must alter the germ 
line—the cell lineage that gives rise to the germ cells (Figure 9–4). Thus, 
when we track the genetic changes that accumulate during the evolution 
of  sexually  reproducing  organisms,  we  are  looking  at  events  that  took 
place in a germ-line cell. It is through a series of germ-line cell divisions 
that  sexually  reproducing  organisms  trace  their  descent  back  to  their 
ancestors and, ultimately, back to the ancestors of us all—the first cells 
that existed, at the origin of life more than 3.5 billion years ago. 

In addition to perpetuating a species, sex also introduces its own form 
of genetic change: when germ cells from a male and female unite dur-
ing fertilization, they generate offspring that are genetically distinct from 
either  parent.  We  discuss  this  form  of  genetic  diversification  in  detail 
in Chapter 19. In the meantime, aside from this mating-based genome

reshuffling, which influences how mutations are inherited in organisms 
that reproduce sexually, most of the mechanisms that generate genetic 
change are the same for all living things, as we now discuss.

Point mutations Are Caused by failures of the Normal 
mechanisms for Copying and Repairing DNA
Despite the elaborate mechanisms that exist to faithfully copy and repair 
DNA sequences, each nucleotide pair in an organism’s genome runs a 
small risk of changing each time a cell divides. Changes that affect a sin-
gle nucleotide pair are called point mutations. These typically arise from 
rare errors in DNA replication or repair (discussed in Chapter 6).

The point mutation rate has been determined directly in experiments with 
bacteria such as E. coli. Under laboratory conditions, E. coli divides about 
once every 20–25 minutes; in less than a day, a single E. coli can produce 
more descendants than there are humans on Earth—enough to provide 
a  good  chance  for  almost  any  conceivable  point  mutation  to  occur.  A 
culture containing 109 E. coli cells thus harbors millions of mutant cells 
whose genomes differ subtly from the ancestor cell. Some of these muta-
tions may confer a selective advantage on individual cells: resistance to 
a poison, for example, or the ability to survive when deprived of a stand-
ard nutrient. By exposing the culture to a selective condition—adding an 
antibiotic or removing an essential nutrient, for example—one can find 
these  needles  in  the  haystack;  that  is,  the  cells  that  have  undergone  a 
specific mutation enabling them to survive in conditions where the origi-
nal cells cannot (Figure 9–5). Such experiments have revealed that the 
overall point mutation frequency in E. coli is about 3 changes per 1010 
nucleotide pairs each cell generation. The mutation rate in humans, as 
determined by comparing the DNA sequences of children and their par-
ents (and estimating how many times the parental germ cells divided), is

Figure 9–5 Mutation rates can be measured in the laboratory. In this experiment, an E. coli strain that carries a deleterious point 
mutation in the His gene—which is needed to manufacture the amino acid histidine—is used. the mutation converts a G-c nucleotide 
pair to an a-t, resulting in a premature stop signal in the mrNa produced from the mutant gene (left box). as long as histidine is 
supplied in the growth medium, this strain can grow and divide normally. If a large number of mutant cells (say 1010) is spread on an 
agar plate that lacks histidine, the great majority will die. the rare survivors will contain a “reversion” mutation (in which the a-t is 
changed back to a G-c). this reversion corrects the original defect and now allows the bacterium to make the enzyme it needs to 
survive in the absence of histidine. Such mutations happen by chance and only rarely, but the ability to work with very large numbers of 
E. coli cells makes it possible to detect this change and to accurately measure its frequency.

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

about one-third that of E. coli—which suggests that the mechanisms that 
evolved to maintain genome integrity operate with an efficiency that does 
not differ significantly in even distantly related species. 

Point mutations can destroy a gene’s activity or—very rarely—improve it 
(as shown in Figure 9–5). More often, however, they do neither of these 
things.  At  many  sites  in  the  genome,  a  point  mutation  has  absolutely 
no effect on the organism’s appearance, viability, or ability to reproduce. 
Such neutral mutations often fall in regions of the gene where the DNA 
sequence is unimportant, including most of an intron’s sequence. In cases 
where they occur within an exon, neutral mutations can change the third 
position of a codon such that the amino acid it specifies is unchanged—or 
is so similar that the protein’s function is unaffected. 

Point mutations Can Change the Regulation of a Gene
Mutations  in  the  coding  sequences  of  genes  are  fairly  easy  to  spot 
because they change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein in 
predictable ways. But mutations in regulatory DNA are more difficult to 
recognize, because they don’t affect protein sequence and can be located 
some distance from the coding sequence of the gene.

Despite  these  difficulties,  many  examples  have  been  discovered  where 
point  mutations  in  regulatory  DNA  have  a  profound  effect  on  the  pro-
tein’s  production  and  thereby  on  the  organism.  For  example,  a  small 
number of people are resistant to malaria because of a point mutation 
that affects the expression of a cell-surface receptor to which the malaria 
parasite  Plasmodium  vivax  binds.  The  mutation  prevents  the  receptor 
from  being  produced  in  red  blood  cells,  rendering  the  individuals  who 
carry this mutation immune to malarial infection. 

Point  mutations  in  regulatory  DNA  also  have  a  role  in  our  ability  to 
digest lactose, the main sugar in milk. Our earliest ancestors were lac-
tose  intolerant,  because  the  enzyme  that  breaks  down  lactose—called 
lactase—was  made  only  during  infancy.  Adults,  who  were  no  longer 
exposed to breast milk, did not need the enzyme. When humans began to 
get milk from domestic animals some 10,000 years ago, variant genes—
produced by random mutation—enabled those who carried the variation 
to continue to express lactase as adults. We now know that people who 
retain the ability to digest milk as adults contain a point mutation in the 
regulatory DNA of the lactase gene, allowing it to be efficiently transcribed 
throughout life. In a sense, these milk-drinking adults are “mutants” with 
respect to their ability to digest lactose. It is remarkable how quickly this 
trait  spread  through  the  human  population,  especially  in  societies  that 
depended heavily on milk for nutrition (Figure 9–6). 

These  evolutionary  changes  in  the  regulatory  sequence  of  the  lactase 
gene occurred relatively recently (10,000 years ago), well after humans 
became  a  distinct  species.  However,  much  more  ancient  changes  in 
regulatory sequences have occurred in other genes, and some of these 
are thought to underlie many of the profound differences among species 
(Figure 9–7).

DNA Duplications Give Rise to families of Related Genes 
Point mutations can influence the activity of an existing gene, but how 
do new genes with new functions come into being? Gene duplication is 
perhaps the most important mechanism for generating new genes from 
old  ones.  Once  a  gene  has  been  duplicated,  each  of  the  two  copies  is 
free  to  accumulate  mutations  that  might  allow  it  to  perform  a  slightly 
different function—as long as the original activity of the gene is not lost. 
This  specialization  of  duplicated  genes  occurs  gradually,  as  mutations

Figure 9–6 the ability of adult humans to digest milk followed the domestication of cattle. approximately 
10,000 years ago, humans in northern europe and central africa began to raise cattle. the subsequent availability 
of cow’s milk—particularly during periods of starvation—gave a selective advantage to those humans able to digest 
lactose as adults. two independent point mutations that allow the expression of lactase in adults arose in human 
populations—one in northern europe and another in central africa. these mutations have since spread through 
different regions of the world. For example, the migration of Northern europeans to North america and australia 
explains why most people living on these continents can digest lactose as adults; the native populations of North 
america and australia, however, remain lactose intolerant.

accumulate in the descendants of the original cell in which gene duplica-
tion occurred. By repeated rounds of this process of gene  duplication 
and divergence over many millions of years, one gene can give rise to a 
whole family of genes, each with a specialized function, within a single 
genome. Analysis of genome sequences reveals many examples of such 
gene families: in Bacillus subtilis, for example, nearly half of the genes 
have  one  or  more  obvious  relatives  elsewhere  in  the  genome.  And  in 
vertebrates,  the  globin  family  of  genes,  which  encode  oxygen-carrying 
proteins, clearly arose from a single primordial gene, as we see shortly. 
But how does gene duplication occur in the first place?

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

Figure 9–8 Gene duplication can be 
caused by crossovers between short, 
repeated Dna sequences in adjacent 
homologous chromosomes. the two 
chromosomes shown here undergo 
homologous recombination at short 
repeated sequences (red ), that bracket a 
gene (orange). these repeated sequences 
can be remnants of mobile genetic 
elements, which are present in many copies 
in the human genome, as we discuss shortly. 
When crossing-over occurs unequally, as 
shown, one chromosome will get two copies 
of the gene, while the other will get none. 
the type of homologous recombination 
that produces gene duplications is called 
unequal crossing-over because the resulting 
products are unequal in size. If this process 
occurs in the germ line, some progeny will 
inherit the long chromosome, while others 
will inherit the short one.

Many  gene  duplications  are  believed  to  be  generated  by  homologous 
recombination.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  6,  homologous  recombination 
provides an important mechanism for mending a broken double helix; it 
allows an intact chromosome to be used as a template to repair a dam-
aged  sequence  on  its  homolog.  Homologous  recombination  normally 
takes place only after two long stretches of nearly identical DNA become 
paired, so that the information in the intact piece of DNA can be used 
to “restore” the sequence in the broken DNA. On rare occasions, how-
ever,  a  recombination  event  can  occur  between  a  pair  of  shorter  DNA 
sequences—identical or very similar—that fall on either side of a gene. If 
these short sequences are not aligned properly during recombination, a 
lopsided exchange of genetic information can occur. Such unequal cross-
overs can generate one chromosome that has an extra copy of the gene 
and  another  with  no  copy  (Figure  9–8).  Once  a  gene  has  been  dupli-
cated in this way, subsequent unequal crossovers can readily add extra 
copies to the duplicated set by the same mechanism. As a result, entire 
sets of closely related genes, arranged in series, are commonly found in 
genomes.

The Evolution of the Globin Gene family shows how Gene 
Duplication and Divergence Can Produce New Proteins 
The  evolutionary  history  of  the  globin  gene  family  provides  a  striking 
example of how gene duplication and divergence has generated new pro-
teins. The unmistakable similarities in amino acid sequence and structure 
among the present-day globin proteins indicate that all the globin genes 
must derive from a single ancestral gene.

The simplest globin protein has a polypeptide chain of about 150 amino 
acids, which is found in many marine worms, insects, and primitive fish. 
Like our hemoglobin, this protein transports oxygen molecules through-
out the animal’s body. The oxygen-carrying protein in the blood of adult 
mammals and most other vertebrates, however, is more complex; it is 
composed  of  four  globin  chains  of  two  distinct  types—α  globin  and  β 
globin (Figure 9–9). The four oxygen-binding sites in the α2β2 molecule 
interact,  allowing  an  allosteric  change  in  the  molecule  as  it  binds  and 
releases oxygen. This structural shift enables the four-chain hemoglobin 
molecule to efficiently take up and release four oxygen molecules in an 
all-or-none fashion, a feat not possible for the single-chain version. This 
efficiency is particularly important for large multicellular animals, which 

Figure 9–9 an ancestral globin gene encoding a single-chain 
globin molecule is thought to have given rise to the pair of genes 
that produce four-chain hemoglobin proteins of modern humans 
and other mammals. the mammalian hemoglobin molecule is a 
complex of two α- and two β-globin chains. each chain has a bound 
heme group (red) that is responsible for binding oxygen. 

cannot rely on the simple diffusion of oxygen through the body to oxy-
genate their tissues adequately.
The  α-  and  β-globin  genes  are  the  result  of  gene  duplications  that 
occurred  early  in  vertebrate  evolution.  Genome  analyses  suggest  that 
one  of  our  ancient  ancestors  had  a  single  globin  gene.  But  about  500 
million  years  ago,  gene  duplications  followed  by  mutation  are  thought 
to  have  given  rise  to  two  slightly  different  globin  genes,  one  encoding 
α globin, the other encoding β globin. Still later, as the different mam-
mals  began  diverging  from  their  common  ancestor,  the  β-globin  gene 
underwent its own duplication and divergence to give rise to a second 
β-like globin gene that is expressed specifically in the fetus (Figure 9–10). 
The resulting fetal hemoglobin molecule has a higher affinity for oxygen 
compared with adult hemoglobin, a property that helps transfer oxygen 
from mother to fetus.
Subsequent rounds of duplication in both the α- and β-globin genes gave 
rise  to  additional  members  of  these  families.  Each  of  these  duplicated 
genes has been modified by point mutations that affect the properties of 
the final hemoglobin molecule, and by changes in regulatory DNA that 
determine when—and how strongly—each gene is expressed. As a result, 
each globin differs slightly in its ability to bind and release oxygen and in 
the stage of development during which it is expressed. 

In addition to these specialized globin genes, there are several duplicated 
DNA sequences in the α- and β-globin gene clusters that are not func-
tional genes. They are similar in DNA sequence to the functional globin 
genes, but they have been disabled by the accumulation of many muta-
tions that inactivate them. The existence of such pseudogenes makes it 
clear that, as might be expected, not every DNA duplication leads to a 
new functional gene. Most gene duplication events are unsuccessful in 
that  one  copy  is  gradually  inactivated  by  mutation.  Although  we  have 
focused here on the evolution of the globin genes, similar rounds of gene 
duplication and divergence have clearly taken place in many other gene 
families present in the human genome. 

Figure 9–10 repeated rounds of duplication and mutation are 
thought to have generated the globin gene family in humans. 
about 500 million years ago, an ancestral globin gene duplicated and 
gave rise to the β-globin gene family (including the five genes shown) 
and the related α-globin gene family. In most vertebrates, a molecule 
of hemoglobin (see Figure 9–9) is formed from two chains of  
α globin and two chains of β globin—which can be any one of the five 
subtypes of the β family listed here.  
   the evolutionary scheme shown was worked out by comparing globin 
genes from many different organisms. the nucleotide sequences of 
the γG and γa genes—which produce the β-globin-like chains that form 
fetal hemoglobin—are much more similar to each other than either of 
them is to the adult β gene. and the δ-globin gene that arose during 
primate evolution encodes a minor β-globin form that’s only made in 
adult primates. In humans, the β-globin genes are located in a cluster 
on chromosome 11. a subsequent chromosome breakage event, which 
occurred about 300 million years ago, is believed to have separated 
the α- and β-globin genes; the α-globin genes now reside on human 
chromosome 16 (not shown).

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

Figure 9–11 Different species of the frog Xenopus have different 
Dna contents. X. tropicalis (above) has an ordinary diploid genome 
with two sets of chromosomes in every somatic cell; the tetraploid  
X. laevis (below) has a duplicated genome containing twice as much 
DNa per cell. (courtesy of enrique amaya.)

Whole-Genome Duplications have shaped the 
Evolutionary history of many species 
Almost every gene in the genomes of vertebrates exists in multiple ver-
sions,  suggesting  that,  rather  than  single  genes  being  duplicated  in  a 
piecemeal  fashion,  the  whole  vertebrate  genome  was  long  ago  dupli-
cated in one fell swoop. Early in vertebrate evolution, it appears that the 
entire genome actually underwent duplication twice in succession, giv-
ing rise to four copies of every gene. In some groups of vertebrates, such 
as the salmon and carp families (including the zebrafish; see Figure 1–37), 
there may have been yet another duplication, creating an eightfold mul-
tiplicity of genes. 

The  precise  history  of  whole-genome  duplications  in  vertebrate  evo-
lution  is  difficult  to  chart  because  many  other  changes  have  occurred 
since  these  ancient  evolutionary  events.  In  some  organisms,  however, 
full genome duplications are especially obvious, as they have occurred 
relatively recently—evolutionarily speaking. The frog genus Xenopus, for 
example, comprises a set of closely similar species related to one another 
by  repeated  duplications  or  triplications  of  the  whole  genome  (Figure 
9–11). Such large-scale duplications can happen if cell division fails to 
occur following a round of genome replication in the germ line of a par-
ticular individual. Once an accidental doubling of the genome occurs in a 
germ-line cell, it will be faithfully passed on to germ-line progeny cells in 
that individual and, ultimately, to any offspring these cells might produce.

Novel Genes Can Be Created by Exon shuffling 
As we discussed in Chapter 4, many proteins are composed of a set of 
smaller functional domains. In eukaryotes, each of these protein domains 
is  usually  encoded  by  a  separate  exon,  which  is  surrounded  by  long 
stretches of noncoding introns (see Figures 7–17 and 7–18). This organi-
zation of eukaryotic genes can facilitate the evolution of new proteins by 
allowing exons from one gene to be added to another—a process called 
exon shuffling. 

This duplication and movement of exons is promoted by the same type of 
recombination that gives rise to gene duplications (see Figure 9–8). In this 
case, recombination occurs within the introns that surround the exons. If 
the introns in question are from two different genes, this recombination 
can generate a hybrid gene that includes complete exons from both. The 
presumed  results  of  such  exon  shuffling  are  seen  in  many  present-day 
proteins, which contain a patchwork of many different protein domains 
(Figure 9–12).

It has been proposed that all the proteins encoded by the human genome 
(approximately 21,000) arose from the duplication and shuffling of a few 
thousand  distinct  exons,  each  encoding  a  protein  domain  of  approxi-
mately 30–50 amino acids. This remarkable idea suggests that the great 

Figure 9–12 exon shuffling during evolution can generate proteins 
with new combinations of protein domains. each type of colored 
symbol represents a different protein domain. these different domains 
are thought to have been joined together by exon shuffling during 
evolution to create the modern-day human proteins shown here.

The Evolution of Genomes has Been Profoundly 
Influenced by the movement of mobile Genetic Elements 
Mobile genetic elements—DNA sequences that can move from one chro-
mosomal  location  to  another—are  an  important  source  of  genomic 
change and have profoundly affected the structure of modern genomes. 
These parasitic DNA sequences can colonize a genome and then spread 
within it. In the process, they often disrupt the function or alter the regu-
lation of existing genes; sometimes they even create novel genes through 
fusions between mobile sequences and segments of existing genes. 

The insertion of a mobile genetic element into the coding sequence of a 
gene or into its regulatory region can cause the “spontaneous” mutations 
that are observed in many of today’s organisms. Mobile genetic elements 
can severely disrupt a gene’s activity if they land directly within its cod-
ing sequence. Such an insertion mutation destroys the gene’s capacity to 
encode a useful protein—as is the case for a number of mutations that 
cause hemophilia in humans, for example. 

The activity of mobile genetic elements can also change the way existing 
genes are regulated. An insertion of an element into a regulatory DNA 
region, for instance, will often have a striking effect on where and when 
genes are expressed (Figure 9–13). Many mobile genetic elements carry 
DNA sequences that are recognized by specific transcription regulators; if 
these elements insert themselves near a gene, that gene can be brought 
under the control of these transcription regulators, thereby changing the 
gene’s expression pattern. Thus, mobile genetic elements can be a major 
source of developmental changes: They are thought to have been partic-
ularly important in the evolution of the body plans of multicellular plants 
and animals.

Finally,  mobile  genetic  elements  provide  opportunities  for  genome  re-
arrangements by serving as targets of homologous recombination (see 
Figure 9–8). For example, the duplications that gave rise to the β-globin 
gene  cluster  are  thought  to  have  occurred  by  crossovers  between  the 
abundant  mobile  genetic  elements  sprinkled  throughout  the  human 
genome. Later in the chapter, we describe these elements in more detail 
and  discuss  the  mechanisms  that  have  allowed  them  to  establish  a 
stronghold within our genome.

produce a major change in the appearance of an organism. (a, courtesy of e.B. Lewis; B, courtesy of Matthew Scott.)

Why do you suppose that horizontal 
gene transfer is more prevalent 
in single-celled organisms than in 
multicellular organisms?

Figure 9–14 Bacterial cells can exchange Dna through 
conjugation. conjugation begins when a donor cell (top) attaches to 
a recipient cell (bottom) by a fine appendage, called a sex pilus. DNa 
from the donor cell then moves through the pilus into the recipient 
cell. In this electron micrograph, the sex pilus has been labeled along 
its length by viruses that specifically bind to it and make the structure 
more visible. conjugation is one of several ways in which bacteria carry 
out horizontal gene transfer. (courtesy of charles c. Brinton Jr. and 
Judith carnahan.) 

Genes Can Be Exchanged Between Organisms by 
horizontal Gene Transfer
So  far  we  have  considered  genetic  changes  that  take  place  within  the 
genome of an individual organism. However, genes and other portions of 
genomes can also be exchanged between individuals of different species. 
This mechanism of horizontal gene transfer is rare among eukaryotes 
but common among bacteria, which can exchange DNA by the process of 
conjugation (Figure 9–14 and Movie 9.1).
E.  coli,  for  example,  has  acquired  about  one-fifth  of  its  genome  from 
other bacterial species within the past 100 million years. And such genetic 
exchanges are currently responsible for the rise of new and potentially 
dangerous strains of drug-resistant bacteria. Genes that confer resistance 
to antibiotics are readily transferred from species to species, providing 
the recipient bacterium with an enormous selective advantage in evad-
ing  the  antimicrobial  compounds  that  constitute  modern  medicine’s 
frontline  attack  against  bacterial  infection.  As  a  result,  many  antibiot-
ics are no longer effective against the common bacterial infections for 
which they were originally used; as an example, most strains of Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea, are now resistant to 
penicillin, which is therefore no longer the primary drug used to treat this 
disease. 

RECONsTRuCTING lIfE’s fAmIly TREE
We  have  seen  how  genomes  can  change  over  evolutionary  time.  The 
nucleotide sequences of present-day genomes provide a record of those 
changes that conferred biological success. By comparing the genomes of 
a variety of living organisms, we can thus begin to decipher our evolu-
tionary history, seeing how our ancestors veered off in adventurous new 
directions that led us to where we are today. 

The most astonishing revelation of such genome comparisons has been 
that homologous genes—those that are similar in nucleotide sequence 
because of their common ancestry—can be recognized across vast evo-
lutionary distances. Unmistakable homologs of many human genes are 
easy to detect in organisms such as worms, fruit flies, yeasts, and even 
bacteria. Although the lineage that led to the evolution of vertebrates is 
thought to have diverged from the one that led to nematode worms and 
insects more than 600 million years ago, when we compare the genomes 
of  the  nematode  Caenorhabditis  elegans,  the  fruit  fly  Drosophila  mela-
nogaster, and Homo sapiens, we find that about 50% of the genes in each 
of these species have clear homologs in one or both of the other two spe-
cies. In other words, clearly recognizable versions of at least half of all 
human genes were already present in the common ancestor of worms, 
flies, and humans.

By tracing such relationships among genes, we can begin to define the 
evolutionary relationships among different species, placing each bacte-
rium, animal, plant, or fungus in a single vast family tree of life. In this 

section,  we  discuss  how  these  relationships  are  determined  and  what 
they tell us about our genetic heritage.

Genetic Changes That Provide a selective Advantage Are 
likely to Be Preserved
Evolution is commonly thought of as progressive, but at the molecular 
level the process is random. Consider the fate of a point mutation that 
occurs in a germ-line cell. On rare occasions, the mutation might cause a 
change for the better. But most often it will either have no consequence 
or cause serious damage. Mutations of the first type will tend to be per-
petuated, because the organism that inherits them will have an increased 
likelihood of reproducing itself. Mutations that are selectively neutral may 
or may not be passed on. And mutations that are deleterious will be lost. 
Through  endless  repetition  of  such  cycles  of  error  and  trial—of  muta-
tion and natural selection—organisms gradually evolve. Their genomes 
change and they develop new ways to exploit the environment—to out-
compete others and to reproduce successfully.

Clearly, some parts of the genome can accumulate mutations more eas-
ily than others in the course of evolution. A segment of DNA that does 
not code for protein or RNA and has no significant regulatory role is free 
to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random mutation. 
In  contrast,  deleterious  alterations  in  a  gene  that  codes  for  an  essen-
tial protein or RNA molecule cannot be accommodated so easily: when 
mutations occur, the faulty organism will almost always be eliminated 
or  fail  to  reproduce.  Genes  of  this  latter  sort  are  therefore  highly  con-
served; that is, the proteins they encode are very similar from organism 
to  organism.  Throughout  the  3.5  billion  years  or  more  of  evolutionary 
history, the most highly conserved genes remain perfectly recognizable 
in all living species. They encode crucial proteins such as DNA and RNA 
polymerases, and they are the ones we turn to when we wish to trace 
family relationships among the most distantly related organisms in the 
tree of life. 

Closely Related Organisms have Genomes That Are 
similar in Organization As Well As sequence 
For species that are closely related, it is often most informative to focus 
on selectively neutral mutations. Because they accumulate steadily at a 
rate that is unconstrained by selection pressures, these mutations pro-
vide  a  metric  for  gauging  how  much  modern  species  have  diverged 
from their common ancestor. Such comparisons of nucleotide changes 
allow  the  construction  of  a  phylogenetic  tree,  a  diagram  that  depicts 
the evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms. Figure 9–15 
presents a phylogenetic tree that lays out the relationships among higher 
primates.

highly conserved genes such as 
those for ribosomal RNA are present 
as clearly recognizable relatives in all 
organisms on Earth; thus, they have 
evolved very slowly over time. Were 
such genes “born” perfect?

Figure 9–15 phylogenetic trees display 
the relationships among modern life-
forms. In this family tree of higher primates, 
humans fall closer to chimpanzees than to 
gorillas or orangutans, as there are fewer 
differences between human and chimp 
DNa sequences than there are between 
those of humans and gorillas, or of humans 
and orangutans. as indicated, the genome 
sequences of each of these four species 
are estimated to differ from the sequence 
of the last common ancestor of higher 
primates by about 1.5%. Because changes 
occur independently in each lineage, the 
divergence between any two species will 
be twice as much as the amount of change 
that takes place between each of the 
species and their last common ancestor. For 
example, although humans and orangutans 
differ from their common ancestor by about 
1.5% in terms of nucleotide sequence, 
they typically differ from one another by 
slightly more than 3%; human and chimp 
genomes differ by about 1.2%. although 
this phylogenetic tree is based solely on 
nucleotide sequences, the estimated dates 
of divergence, shown on the right side of 
the graph, derive from data obtained from 
the fossil record. (Modified from F.c. chen

It is clear from this figure that chimpanzees are our closest living rela-
tive among the higher primates. Not only do chimpanzees seem to have 
essentially the same set of genes as we do, but their genes are arranged 
in  nearly  the  same  way.  The  only  substantial  exception  is  human 
Chromosome  2,  which  arose  from  a  fusion  of  two  chromosomes  that 
remain  separate  in  the  chimpanzee,  gorilla,  and  orangutan.  Humans 
and  chimpanzees  are  so  closely  related  that  it  is  possible  to  use  DNA 
sequence comparisons to reconstruct the sequence of genes that must 
have been present in the now-extinct, common ancestor of the two spe-
cies (Figure 9–16). 

ECB4 e9.19/9.16

Even  the  rearrangement  of  genomes  by  recombination,  which  we 
described  earlier,  has  produced  only  minor  differences  between  the 
human  and  chimp  genomes.  For  example,  both  the  chimp  and  human 
genomes  contain  a  million  copies  of  a  type  of  mobile  genetic  element 
called  an  Alu  sequence.  More  than  99%  of  these  elements  are  in  cor-
responding  positions  in  both  genomes,  indicating  that  most  of  the  Alu 
sequences in our genome were in place before humans and chimpanzees 
diverged. 

functionally Important Genome Regions show up As 
Islands of Conserved DNA sequence 
As  we  delve  back  further  into  our  evolutionary  history  and  compare 
our genomes with those of more distant relatives, the picture begins to 
change. The lineages of humans and mice, for example, diverged about 
75 million years ago. These genomes are about the same size, contain 
practically the same genes, and are both riddled with mobile genetic ele-
ments. However, the mobile genetic elements found in mouse and human 
DNA,  although  similar  in  sequence,  are  distributed  differently,  as  they 
have had more time to proliferate and move around the two genomes 
since these species diverged (Figure 9–17).

Figure 9–17 the positions of mobile 
genetic elements in the human and 
mouse genomes reflect the long 
evolutionary time separating the 
two species. this stretch of human 
chromosome 11 (introduced in Figure 
9–10) contains five functional β-globin-like 
genes (orange); the comparable region 
from the mouse genome contains only 
four. the positions of two types of mobile 
genetic element—Alu sequences (green) 
and L1 sequences (red )—are shown in each 
genome. although the mobile genetic 
elements in human (circles) and mouse 
(triangles) are not identical, they are closely 
related. the absence of these elements 
within the globin genes can be attributed 
to natural selection, which most likely 
eliminated any insertion that compromised 
gene function. (the mobile genetic element 
that falls inside the human β-globin gene 
(far right) is actually located within an 
intron.) (courtesy of ross hardison and

In addition to the movement of mobile genetic elements, the large-scale 
organization of the human and mouse genomes has been scrambled by 
many episodes of chromosome breakage and recombination in the past 
75  million  years:  it  is  estimated  that  about  180  such  “break-and-join” 
events  have  dramatically  altered  chromosome  structure.  For  example, 
in  humans  most  centromeres  lie  near  the  middle  of  the  chromosome, 
whereas those of mouse are located at the chromosome ends. 

ECB4 e9.20/9.17

In spite of this significant degree of genetic shuffling, one can neverthe-
less still recognize many blocks of conserved  synteny, regions where 
corresponding genes are strung together in the same order in both spe-
cies. These genes were neighbors in the ancestral species and, despite all 
the chromosomal upheavals, they remain neighbors in the two present-
day species. More than 90% of the mouse and human genomes can be 
partitioned into such corresponding regions of conserved synteny. Within 
these regions, we can align the DNA of mouse with that of humans so 
that we can compare the nucleotide sequences in detail. Such genome-
wide sequence comparisons reveal that, in the roughly 75 million years 
since  humans  and  mice  diverged  from  their  common  ancestor,  about 
50% of the nucleotides have changed. Against this background of dissim-
ilarity, however, one can now begin to see very clearly the regions where 
changes are not tolerated, so that the human and mouse sequences have 
remained nearly the same (Figure 9–18). Here, the sequences have been 
conserved by purifying selection—that is, by the elimination of individu-
als carrying mutations that interfere with important functions. 

The  power  of  comparative  genomics  can  be  increased  by  stacking  our 
genome up against the genomes of additional animals, including the rat, 
chicken, and dog. Such comparisons take advantage of the results of the 
“natural  experiment”  that  has  lasted  for  hundreds  of  millions  of  years, 
and they highlight some of the most important regions of these genomes. 
These comparisons reveal that roughly 4.5% of the human genome con-
sists of DNA sequences that are highly conserved in many other mammals 
(Figure 9–19). Surprisingly, only about one-third of these sequences code 
for  proteins.  Some  of  the  conserved  noncoding  sequences  correspond

to regulatory DNA, whereas others are transcribed to produce RNA mol-
ecules that are not translated into protein but serve regulatory functions 
(discussed in Chapter 8). The functions of the majority of these conserved 
noncoding sequences, however, remain unknown. The unexpected dis-
covery of these mysterious conserved DNA sequences suggests that we 
ECB4 e9.22/9.19
understand much less about the cell biology of mammals than we had 
previously imagined. With the plummeting cost and accelerating speed of 
whole-genome sequencing, we can expect many more surprises that will 
lead to an increased understanding in the years ahead.

Genome Comparisons show That Vertebrate Genomes 
Gain and lose DNA Rapidly
Going  back  even  further  in  evolution,  we  can  compare  our  genome 
with those of more distantly related vertebrates. The lineages of fish and 
mammals diverged about 400 million years ago. This is long enough for 
random sequence changes and differing selection pressures to have oblit-
erated  almost  every  trace  of  similarity  in  nucleotide  sequence—except 
where purifying selection has operated to prevent change. Regions of the 
genome conserved between humans and fishes thus stand out even more 
strikingly  than  those  conserved  between  different  mammals.  In  fishes, 
one can still recognize most of the same genes as in humans and even 
many of the same segments of regulatory DNA. On the other hand, the 
extent of duplication of any given gene is often different, resulting in dif-
ferent numbers of members of gene families in the two species. 

But even more striking is the finding that although all vertebrate genomes 
contain roughly the same number of genes, their overall size varies con-
siderably.  Whereas  human,  dog,  and  mouse  are  all  in  the  same  size 
range  (around  3  ×  109  nucleotide  pairs),  the  chicken  genome  is  only 
one-third this size. An extreme example of genome compression is the 
pufferfish Fugu rubripes (Figure 9–20), whose tiny genome is one-tenth 
the  size  of  mammalian  genomes,  largely  because  of  the  small  size  of 

Figure 9–20 the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, has a remarkably 
compact genome. at 400 million nucleotide pairs, the Fugu genome 
is only one-quarter the size of the zebrafish genome, even though 
the two species have nearly the same genes. (From a woodcut by 
hiroshige, courtesy of arts and Designs of Japan.)

its  introns.  Fugu  introns,  as  well  as  other  noncoding  segments  in  the 
animal’s genome, lack the repetitive DNA that makes up a large portion 
of most mammalian genomes. Nonetheless, the positions of most Fugu 
introns are perfectly conserved when compared with their positions in 
mammalian genomes (Figure 9–21). Clearly, the intron structure of most 
vertebrate genes was already in place in the common ancestor of fish and 
mammals. 

What factors could be responsible for the size differences among mod-
ern vertebrate genomes? Detailed comparisons of many genomes have 
led  to  the  unexpected  finding  that  small  blocks  of  sequence  are  being 
lost  from  and  added  to  genomes  at  a  surprisingly  rapid  rate.  It  seems 
likely, for example, that the Fugu genome is so tiny because it lost DNA 
sequences faster than it gained them. Over long periods, this imbalance 
apparently cleared out those DNA sequences whose loss could be toler-
ated. This “cleansing” process has been enormously helpful to biologists: 
by “trimming the fat” from the Fugu genome, evolution has provided a 
conveniently  slimmed-down  version  of  a  vertebrate  genome  in  which 
the only DNA sequences that remain are those that are very likely to have 
important functions.

sequence Conservation Allows us to Trace Even the most 
Distant Evolutionary Relationships
As  we  go  back  further  still  to  the  genomes  of  our  even  more  distant 
relatives—beyond  apes,  mice,  fish,  flies,  worms,  plants,  and  yeasts,  all 
the way to bacteria—we find fewer and fewer resemblances to our own 
genome.  Yet  even  across  this  enormous  evolutionary  divide,  purifying 
selection has maintained a few hundred fundamentally important genes. 
By comparing the sequences of these genes in different organisms and 
seeing how far they have diverged, we can attempt to construct a phy-
logenetic tree that goes all the way back to the ultimate ancestors—the 
cells at the very origins of life, from which we all derive. 

To construct such a tree, biologists have focused on one particular gene 
that is conserved in all living species: the gene that codes for the ribo-
somal  RNA  (rRNA)  of  the  small  ribosomal  subunit  (see  Figure  7–32). 
Because the process of translation is fundamental to all living cells, this

Figure 9–22 Some genetic information has been conserved since the beginnings of life. a part of the gene 
for the small subunit rrNa (see Figure 7–32) is shown. corresponding segments of nucleotide sequence from this 
gene in three distantly related species (Methanococcus jannaschii, an archaeon; Escherichia coli, a bacterium; and 
Homo sapiens, a eukaryote) are aligned in parallel. Sites where the nucleotides are identical between species are 
indicated by green shading; the human sequence is repeated at the bottom of the alignment so that all three two-
way comparisons can be seen. the red dot halfway along the E. coli sequence denotes a site where a nucleotide 
has been either deleted from the bacterial lineage in the course of evolution or inserted in the other two lineages. 
Note that the three sequences have all diverged from one another to a roughly similar extent, while still retaining 
unmistakable similarities.

component of the ribosome has been highly conserved since early in the 
history of life on Earth (Figure 9–22).

By applying the same principles used to construct the primate family tree 
(see  Figure  9–15),  the  small  subunit  rRNA  nucleotide  sequences  have 
been used to create a single, all-encompassing tree of life. Although many 
aspects of this phylogenetic tree were anticipated by classical taxonomy 
(which is based on the outward appearance of organisms), there were 
also  many  surprises.  Perhaps  the  most  important  was  the  realization 
that some of the organisms that were traditionally classed as “bacteria” 
are as widely divergent in their evolutionary origins as is any prokary-
ote from  any  eukaryote. As  discussed in  Chapter 1,  it  is  now  apparent 
that the prokaryotes comprise two distinct groups—the bacteria and the 
archaea—that  diverged  early  in  the  history  of  life  on  Earth.  The  living 
world therefore has three major divisions or domains: bacteria, archaea, 
and eukaryotes (Figure 9–23). 

Although we humans have been classifying the visible world since antiq-
uity, we now realize that most of life’s genetic diversity lies in the world 
of microscopic organisms. These microbes have tended to go unnoticed, 
unless they cause disease or rot the timbers of our houses. Yet they make 
up most of the total mass of living matter on our planet. Many of these 
organisms cannot be grown under laboratory conditions. Thus it is only 
through the analysis of DNA sequences, obtained from around the globe, 
that we are beginning to obtain a more detailed understanding of all life 
on Earth—knowledge that is less distorted by our biased perspective as 
large animals living on dry land.

Figure 9–23 the tree of life has three major divisions. each branch on the tree is labeled with the name of a representative member 
of that group, and the length of each branch corresponds to the degree of difference in the DNa sequences that encode their small 
subunit rrNas (see Figure 9–22). Note that all the organisms we can see with the unaided eye—animals, plants, and some fungi 
(highlighted in yellow)—represent only a small subset of the diversity of life.

ECB4 e9.26/9.23

TRANsPOsONs AND VIRusEs 
The tree of life depicted in Figure 9–23 includes representatives from life’s 
most distant branches, from the cyanobacteria that release oxygen into 
the atmosphere to the animals, like us, that use that oxygen to boost their 
metabolism.  What  the  diagram  does  not  encompass,  however,  are  the 
parasitic genetic elements that operate on the outskirts of life. Although 
these elements are built from the same nucleic acids contained in all life-
forms and can multiply and move from place to place, they do not cross 
the threshold of actually being alive. Yet because of their prevalence and 
behavior, these diminutive genetic parasites have major implications for 
the evolution of species and for human health.

Mobile  genetic  elements,  known  informally  as  jumping  genes,  are 
found  in  virtually  all  cells.  Their  DNA  sequences  make  up  almost  half 
of the human genome. Although they can insert themselves into virtu-
ally any DNA sequence, most mobile genetic elements lack the ability to 
leave the cell in which they reside. This is not the case for their relatives, 
the viruses. Not much more than strings of genes wrapped in a protective 
coat, viruses can escape from one cell and infect another. 

In  this  section,  we  briefly  discuss  mobile  genetic  elements  as  well  as 
viruses. We review their structure and outline how they operate—and we 
consider  the  effects  they  have  on  gene  expression,  genome  evolution, 
and the transmission of disease.

mobile Genetic Elements Encode the Components They 
Need for movement 
Mobile  genetic  elements,  also  called  transposons,  are  typically  classi-
fied  according  to  the  mechanism  by  which  they  move  or  transpose.  In 
bacteria,  the  most  common  mobile  genetic  elements  are  the  DNA-only 
transposons. The name is derived from the fact that the element moves 
from one place to another as a piece of DNA, as opposed to being con-
verted  into  an  RNA  intermediate—which  is  the  case  for  another  type 
of  mobile  element  we  discuss  below.  Bacteria  contain  many  different 
DNA-only transposons. Some move to the target site using a simple cut-
and-paste mechanism, whereby the element is simply excised from the 
genome and inserted into a different site; other DNA-only transposons 
replicate their DNA before inserting into the new chromosomal site, leav-
ing the original copy intact at its previous location (Figure 9–24).

Each mobile genetic element typically encodes a specialized enzyme, called 
a transposase, that mediates its movement. These enzymes recognize and 
act on unique DNA sequences that are present on each mobile genetic 
element. Many mobile genetic elements also carry additional genes: some

Figure 9–24 the most common mobile 
genetic elements in bacteria, Dna-
only transposons, move by two types 
of mechanism. (a) In cut-and-paste 
transposition, the element is cut out of the 
donor DNa and inserted into the target 
DNa, leaving behind a broken donor 
DNa molecule, which is subsequently 
repaired. (B) In replicative transposition, the 
mobile genetic element is copied by DNa 
replication. the donor molecule remains 
unchanged, and the target molecule 
receives a copy of the mobile genetic 
element. In general, a particular type of 
transposon moves by only one of these 
mechanisms. however, the two mechanisms 
have many enzymatic similarities, and a few 
transposons can move by either mechanism. 
the donor and target DNas can be part 
of the same DNa molecule or reside on 
different DNa molecules.

308 

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

Figure 9–25 transposons contain the 
components they need for transposition. 
Shown here are three types of bacterial 
DNa-only transposons. each carries a 
gene that encodes a transposase (blue)—
the enzyme that catalyzes the element’s 
movement—as well as DNa sequences (red) 
that are recognized by that transposase. 
   Some transposons carry additional 
genes (yellow) that encode enzymes that 
inactivate antibiotics such as ampicillin 
(AmpR) and tetracycline (TetR). the spread 
of these transposons is a serious problem in 
medicine, as it has allowed many disease-
causing bacteria to become resistant to 
antibiotics developed during the twentieth 
century.

QuEsTION 9–4

many transposons move within a 
genome by replicative mechanisms 
(such as those shown in figure 
9–24B). They therefore increase 
in copy number each time they 
transpose. Although individual 
transposition events are rare, many 
transposons are found in multiple 
copies in genomes. What do you 
suppose keeps the transposons 
from completely overrunning their 
hosts’ genomes?

Figure 9–26 Mobile genetic elements can 
move exons from one gene to another. 
When two mobile genetic elements of the 
same type (red ) happen to insert near each 
other in a chromosome, the transposition 
mechanism occasionally recognizes the 
ends of two different elements (instead 
of the two ends of the same element). as 
a result, the chromosomal DNa that lies 
between the mobile genetic elements gets 
excised and moved to a new site. Such 
inadvertent transposition of chromosomal 
DNa can either generate novel genes, as 
shown, or alter gene regulation (not shown).

mobile genetic elements, for example, carry antibiotic-resistance genes,

ECB4 e6.32/9.25

In  addition  to  relocating  themselves,  mobile  genetic  elements  occa-
sionally rearrange the DNA sequences of the genome in which they are 
embedded.  For  example,  if  two  mobile  genetic  elements  that  are  rec-
ognized  by  the  same  transposase  integrate  into  neighboring  regions 
of  the  same  chromosome,  the  DNA  between  them  can  be  accidentally 
excised and inserted into a different gene or chromosome (Figure 9–26). 
In  eukaryotic  genomes,  such  accidental  transposition  provides  a  path-
way for generating novel genes, both by altering gene expression and by 
duplicating existing genes.  

The human Genome Contains Two major families of 
Transposable sequences
The sequencing of human genomes has revealed many surprises, as we 
describe in detail in the next section. But one of the most stunning was 
the finding that a large part of our DNA is not entirely our own. Nearly 
half of the human genome is made up of mobile genetic elements, which 
number in the millions. Some of these elements have moved from place 
to place within the human genome using the cut-and-paste mechanism 
discussed earlier (see Figure 9–24A). However, most have moved not as 
DNA, but via an RNA intermediate. These retrotransposons appear to be 
unique to eukaryotes.

Figure 9–27 retrotransposons move via 
an rna intermediate. these transposable 
elements are first transcribed into an rNa 
intermediate. Next, a double-stranded 
DNa copy of this rNa is synthesized by 
the enzyme reverse transcriptase. this 
DNa copy is then inserted into the target 
location, which can be on either the same 
or a different DNa molecule. the donor 
retrotransposon remains at its original 
location, so each time it transposes, it 
duplicates itself. these mobile genetic 
elements are called retrotransposons 
because at one stage in their transposition

Discuss the following statement: 
“Viruses exist in the twilight zone 
of life: outside cells they are simply 
dead assemblies of molecules; inside 
cells, however, they are alive.”

One  abundant  human  retrotransposon,  the  L1  element  (sometimes 
referred  to  as  LINE-1,  a  long  interspersed  nuclear  element),  is  tran-
scribed  into  RNA  by  a  host  cell’s  RNA  polymerase.  A  double-stranded 
DNA  copy  of  this  RNA  is  then  made  using  an  enzyme  called  reverse 
transcriptase, an unusual DNA polymerase that can use RNA as a tem-
plate. The reverse transcriptase is encoded by the L1 element itself. The 
DNA copy of the element is then free to reintegrate into another site in 
the genome (Figure 9–27). 

L1 elements constitute about 15% of the human genome. Although most 
copies have been immobilized by the accumulation of deleterious muta-
tions,  a  few  still  retain  the  ability  to  transpose.  Their  movement  can 
sometimes precipitate disease: for example, about 40 years ago, move-
ment of an L1 element into the gene that encodes Factor VIII—a protein 
essential for proper blood clotting—caused hemophilia in an individual 
with no family history of the disease. 

Another type of retrotransposon, the Alu sequence, is present in about 
1 million copies, making up about 10% of our genome. Alu elements do 
not encode their own reverse transcriptase and thus depend on enzymes 
already present in the cell to help them move.

Comparisons of the sequence and locations of the L1 and Alu elements 
in  different  mammals  suggest  that  these  sequences  have  proliferated 
in primates relatively recently in evolutionary history (see Figure 9–17). 
Given that the placement of mobile genetic elements can have profound 
effects  on  gene  expression,  it  is  humbling  to  contemplate  how  many 
of our uniquely human qualities we might owe to these prolific genetic 
parasites.

Viruses Can move Between Cells and Organisms
Viruses are also mobile, but unlike the transposons we have discussed 
so far, they can actually escape from cells and move to other cells and 
organisms.  Viruses  were  first  categorized  as  disease-causing  agents 
that, by virtue of their tiny size, passed through ultrafine filters that can 
hold  back  even  the  smallest  bacterial  cell.  We  now  know  that  viruses 
are essentially genomes enclosed by a protective protein coat, and that 
they must enter a cell and coopt its molecular machinery to express their 
genes, make their proteins, and reproduce. Although the first viruses that 
were discovered attack mammalian cells, it is now recognized that many 
types of viruses exist, and virtually all organisms—including plants, ani-
mals, and bacteria—can serve as viral hosts. 

Viral  reproduction  is  often  lethal  to  the  host  cells;  in  many  cases,  the 
infected  cell  breaks  open  (lyses),  releasing  progeny  viruses,  which  can 
then infect neighboring cells. Many of the symptoms of viral infections 
reflect this lytic effect of the virus. The cold sores formed by herpes sim-
plex virus and the blisters caused by the chickenpox virus, for example, 
reflect the localized killing of human skin cells. 

Most  viruses  that  cause  human  disease  have  genomes  made  of  either 
double-stranded  DNA  or  single-stranded  RNA  (table  9–1).  However, 
viral genomes composed of single-stranded DNA and of double-stranded 
RNA are also known. The simplest viruses found in nature have a small 
genome, composed of as few as three genes, enclosed by a protein coat 
built  from  many  copies  of  a  single  polypeptide  chain.  More  complex 
viruses have larger genomes of up to several hundred genes, surrounded 
by an elaborate shell composed of many different proteins (Figure 9–28). 
The amount of genetic material that can be packaged inside a viral pro-
tein  shell  is  limited.  Because  these  shells  are  too  small  to  encode  the

many enzymes and other proteins that are required to replicate even the 
simplest  virus,  viruses  must  hijack  their  host’s  biochemical  machinery 
to reproduce themselves (Figure 9–29). The viral genome will typically 
encode both viral coat proteins and proteins that help them to coopt the 
host enzymes needed to replicate their genetic material.

Retroviruses Reverse the Normal flow of Genetic 
Information
Although  there  are  many  similarities  between  bacterial  and  eukaryo-
tic  viruses,  one  important  class  of  viruses—the  retroviruses—is  found 
only in eukaryotic cells. In many respects, retroviruses resemble the ret-
rotransposons we just discussed. A key feature of the life cycle of both 
is a step in which DNA is synthesized using RNA as a template—hence 
the  prefix  retro,  which  refers  to  the  reversal  of  the  usual  flow  of  DNA 
information to RNA. Retroviruses are thought to have derived from a ret-
rotransposon that long ago acquired additional genes encoding the coat 
proteins and other proteins required to make a virus particle. The RNA 
stage of its replicative cycle could then be packaged into a viral particle 
that could leave the cell. The complete life cycle of a retrovirus is shown 
in Figure 9–30.

Like retrotransposons, retroviruses use the enzyme reverse transcriptase 
to  convert  RNA  into  DNA.  The  enzyme  is  encoded  by  the  retroviral 
genome, and a few molecules of the enzyme are packaged along with 
the RNA genome in each virus particle. When the single-stranded RNA 
genome of the retrovirus enters a cell, the reverse transcriptase brought 
in with it makes a complementary DNA strand to form a DNA/RNA hybrid 
double helix. The RNA strand is removed, and the reverse transcriptase

host cell’s molecular machinery to 
reproduce. the hypothetical simple virus 
illustrated here consists of a small double-
stranded DNa molecule that encodes 
just a single type of viral coat protein. to 
reproduce, the viral genome must first enter 
a host cell, where it is replicated to produce 
multiple copies, which are transcribed and 
translated to produce the viral coat protein. 
the viral genomes can then assemble 
spontaneously with the coat protein to form 
new virus particles, which escape from the

(which  can  use  either  DNA  or  RNA  as  a  template)  now  synthesizes  a 
complementary  DNA  strand  to  produce  a  DNA  double  helix.  This  DNA 
is then inserted, or integrated, into a randomly selected site in the host 
genome by a virally encoded integrase enzyme. In this integrated state, 
the virus is latent: each time the host cell divides, it passes on a copy of 
the integrated viral genome, which is known as a provirus, to its progeny 
cells.

The  next  step  in  the  replication  of  a  retrovirus—which  can  take  place 
long  after  its  integration  into  the  host  genome—is  the  copying  of  the 
integrated viral DNA into RNA by a host-cell RNA polymerase, which pro-
duces  large  numbers  of  single-stranded  RNAs  identical  to  the  original 
infecting genome. These viral RNAs are then translated by the host-cell 
ribosomes to produce the viral shell proteins, the envelope proteins, and 
reverse transcriptase—all of which are assembled with the RNA genome 
into new virus particles.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the cause of AIDS, is 
a retrovirus. As with other retroviruses, the HIV genome can persist in a 
latent state as a provirus embedded in the chromosomes of an infected 
cell.  This  ability  to  hide  in  host  cells  complicates  attempts  to  treat  the 
infection with antiviral drugs. But because the HIV reverse transcriptase 
is not used by cells for any purpose of their own, it is one of the prime 
targets of drugs currently used to treat AIDS.

Figure 9–30 the life cycle of a retrovirus includes reverse transcription and integration of the viral genome 
into the host cell’s Dna. the retrovirus genome consists of an rNa molecule (blue) that is typically between 7000 
and 12,000 nucleotides in size. It is packaged inside a protein coat, which is surrounded by a lipid-based envelope 
that contains virus-encoded envelope proteins (green). the enzyme reverse transcriptase (red circle), encoded by 
the viral genome and packaged with its rNa, first makes a single-stranded DNa copy of the viral rNa molecule and 
then a second DNa strand, generating a double-stranded DNa copy of the rNa genome. this DNa double helix is 
then integrated into a host chromosome, a step required for the synthesis of new viral rNa molecules by a host-cell 
rNa polymerase.

a pair of sex chromosomes (X and Y)—provide the instructions needed 
to build a human being. Yet, 25 years ago, biologists actively debated the 
value of determining the human genome sequence—the complete list of 
nucleotides contained in our DNA. 

The  task  was  not  simple.  An  international  consortium  of  investigators 
labored tirelessly for the better part of a decade—and spent nearly $3 bil-
lion—to give us our first glimpse of this genetic blueprint. But the effort 
turned out to be well worth the cost, as the data continue to shape our 
thinking about how our genome functions and how it has evolved.  

The first human genome sequence was just the beginning. Spectacular 
improvements in sequencing technologies, coupled with powerful new 
tools  for  handling  massive  amounts  of  data,  are  taking  genomics  to  a 
whole new level. The cost of DNA sequencing has dropped about 100,000-
fold since the human genome project was launched in 1990, such that a 
whole human genome can now be sequenced in a few days for about 
$1000.  Investigators  around  the  world  are  collaborating  to  collect  and 
compare  the  nucleotide  sequences  of  thousands  of  human  genomes. 
This resulting deluge of data promises to tell us what makes us human, 
and what makes each of us unique. 

Figure 9–31 the 3 billion nucleotide pairs of the human genome 
contain a vast amount of information, including clues about our 
origins. If each nucleotide pair is drawn to span 1 mm, as shown in 
(a), the human genome would extend 3200 km (approximately 2000 
miles)—far enough to stretch across central africa, where humans 
first arose (red line in B). at this scale, there would be, on average, a 
protein-coding gene every 150 m. an average gene would extend for 
30 m, but the coding sequences (exons) in this gene would add up to 
only just over a meter; the rest would be introns.

mobile genetic elements, such as 
the Alu sequences, are found in 
many copies in human DNA. In what 
ways could the presence of an Alu 
sequence affect a nearby gene?

Although  it  will  take  decades  to  analyze  the  rapidly  accumulating 
genome data, the recent findings have already influenced the content of 
every chapter in this book. In this section, we describe some of the most 
striking  features  of  the  human  genome—many  of  which  were  entirely 
unexpected. We review what genome comparisons can tell us about how 
we evolved, and we discuss some of the mysteries that still remain. 

The Nucleotide sequences of human Genomes show how 
Our Genes Are Arranged
When the DNA sequence of human Chromosome 22, one of the small-
est  human  chromosomes,  was  completed  in  1999,  it  became  possible 
for the first time to see exactly how genes are arranged along an entire 
vertebrate chromosome (Figure 9–32). The subsequent publication of the 
whole human genome sequence—a first draft in 2001 and a finished draft 
in 2004—provided a more panoramic view of the complete genetic land-
scape, including how many genes we have, what those genes look like, 
and how they are distributed across the genome (table 9–2).

The  first  striking  feature  of  the  human  genome  is  how  little  of  it—less 
than  2%—codes  for  proteins  (Figure  9–33).  In  addition,  almost  half  of 
our DNA is made up of mobile genetic elements that have colonized our 
genome over evolutionary time. Because these elements have accumu-
lated mutations, most can no longer move; rather, they are relics from 
an earlier evolutionary era when mobile genetic elements ran rampant 
through our genome.

It was a surprise to discover how few protein-coding genes our genome 
actually  contains.  Earlier  estimates  had  been  in  the  neighborhood  of 
100,000  (see  How  We  Know,  pp.  316–317).  Although  the  exact  count 
is  still  being  refined,  current  estimates  place  the  number  of  human

Most of the left arm of chromosome 22 consists of short repeated sequences of DNa that are packaged in a particularly compact form 
of chromatin (heterochromatin), as discussed in chapter 5. (B) a tenfold expansion of a portion of chromosome 22 shows about

the LINes (which include L1), SINes (short

Alu), retrotransposons, and DNa-only

that have multiplied in our genome by 
replicating themselves and inserting the 
new copies in different positions. Simple 
repeats are short nucleotide sequences 
(less than 14 nucleotide pairs) that are 
repeated again and again for long stretches. 
Segment duplications are large blocks of 
the genome (1000–200,000 nucleotide pairs) 
that are present at two or more locations 
in the genome. the unique sequences that 
are not part of any introns or exons (dark

sequences that code for functional rNa, 
and sequences whose functions are not 
known. the most highly repeated blocks of 
DNa in heterochromatin have not yet been 
completely sequenced; therefore about

pairs. Most of this DNA is in noncoding introns. In addition to the volumi-
nous introns (see Figure 9–32D), each gene is associated with regulatory 
DNA sequences that ensure that the gene is expressed at the proper level, 
time, and place. In humans, these regulatory DNA sequences are typically 
interspersed along tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs, much of which 
seems to be “spacer” DNA. Indeed, compared to many other eukaryotic 
genomes, the human genome is much less densely packed (Figure 9–34).

MBoC6 n9.100/9.34

Although  exons  and  their  associated  gene  regulatory  sequences  com-
prise less than 2% of the human genome, comparative studies indicate 
that  about  5%  of  the  human  genome  is  highly  conserved  when  com-
pared with other mammalian genomes (see Figure 9–19). An additional 
4% of the genome shows reduced variation in the human population, as 
determined by comparing the DNA sequence of thousands of individuals. 
Taken together, this conservation suggests that about 9% of the human 
genome contains sequences that are likely to be functionally important—
but we do not yet know the function of much of this DNA. 

Accelerated Changes in Conserved Genome sequences 
help Reveal What makes us human
When the chimpanzee genome sequence became available in 2005, sci-
entists began searching for DNA sequence changes that might account 
for  the  striking  differences  between  us  and  them  (Figure  9–35).  With 
about 3 billion nucleotide pairs to compare between the two species, the 
task  is  daunting.  But  the  search  is  made  much  easier  by  confining  the 
comparison to those sequences that are highly conserved across multi-
ple  mammalian  species  (see  Figure  9–19).  These  conserved  sequences 
represent  parts  of  the  genome  that  are  most  likely  to  be  functionally 
important—and  are  thus  areas  of  particular  interest  when  we  search 
for  genetic  changes  that  make  humans  different  from  our  mammalian 
cousins. 

Although  these  sequences  are  conserved,  they  are  not  identical:  when 
the  version  from  one  mammal  is  compared  with  that  of  another,  they 
are typically found to have drifted apart by a small amount, which cor-
responds to the time elapsed since the species diverged during evolution. 
In a small proportion of cases, however, the sequences show signs of a 
sudden evolutionary spurt. For example, some DNA sequences that have 
been  highly  conserved  in  most  mammalian  species  are  found  to  have 
changed  exceptionally  fast  during  the  last  six  million  years  of  human 
evolution.  Such  human  accelerated  regions  are  thought  to  reflect  func-
tions that have been especially important in making us the unique animal 
that we are.

One  study  identified  about  50  such  sites—one-quarter  of  which  were 
located  near  genes  associated  with  brain  development.  The  sequence

HoW We KnoW
CountinG GeneS

How many genes does it take to make a human? It seems 
a natural thing to wonder. If 6000 genes can produce a 
yeast and 13,000 a fly, how many are needed to make a 
human being—a creature curious and clever enough to 
study its own genome? Until researchers completed the 
first draft of the human genome sequence, the most fre-
quently cited estimate was 100,000. But where did that 
figure come from? And how was the revised estimate of 
only 21,000 protein-coding genes derived?

Walter  Gilbert,  a  physicist-turned-biologist  who  won  a 
Nobel  Prize  for  developing  techniques  for  sequencing 
DNA, was one of the first to throw out a ballpark esti-
mate of the number of human genes. In the mid-1980s, 
Gilbert  suggested  that  humans  could  have  100,000 
genes, an estimate based on the average size of the few 
human genes known at the time (about 3 × 104 nucle-
otide pairs) and the size of our genome (about 3 × 109 
nucleotide pairs). This back-of-the-envelope calculation 
yielded a number with such a pleasing roundness that it 
wound up being quoted widely in articles and textbooks.

The  calculation  provides  an  estimate  of  the  number 
of  genes  a  human  could  have  in  principle,  but  it  does 
not address the question of how many genes we actu-
ally  have.  As  it  turns  out,  that  question  is  not  so  easy 
to  answer,  even  with  the  complete  human  genome 
sequence in hand. The problem is, how does one identify 
a gene? Consider protein-coding genes, which comprise 
only 1.5% of the human genome. Looking at a given piece 
of raw DNA sequence—an apparently random string of 
As, Ts, Gs, and Cs—how can one tell which parts repre-
sent protein-coding segments? Being able to accurately 

and reliably distinguish the rare coding sequences from 
the more plentiful noncoding sequences in a genome is 
necessary before one can hope to locate and count its 
genes. 

signals and chunks
As always, the situation is simplest in bacteria and simple 
eukaryotes such as yeasts. In these genomes, genes that 
encode proteins are identified by searching through the 
entire DNA sequence looking for open reading frames 
(ORFs). These are long sequences—say, 100 codons or 
more—that  lack  stop  codons.  A  random  sequence  of 
nucleotides will by chance encode a stop codon about 
once  every  20  codons  (as  there  are  three  stop  codons 
in  the  set  of  64  possible  codons—see  Figure  7–25).  So 
finding an ORF—a continuous nucleotide sequence that 
encodes more than 100 amino acids—is the first step in 
identifying a good candidate for a protein-coding gene. 
Today, computer programs are used to search for such 
ORFs,  which  begin  with  an  initiation  codon,  usually 
ATG, and end with a termination codon, TAA, TAG, or 
TGA (Figure 9–36).

In animals and plants, the process of identifying ORFs is 
complicated by the presence of large intron sequences, 
which interrupt the protein-coding portions of genes. As 
we have seen, these introns are generally much larger 
than the exons, which might represent only a few percent 
of the gene. In human DNA, exons sometimes contain 
as few as 50 codons (150 nucleotide pairs), while introns 
may  exceed  10,000  nucleotide  pairs  in  length.  Fifty 
codons is too short to generate a statistically significant

Figure 9–37 rna sequencing can be used to identify protein-coding genes. presented 
here is a set of data corresponding to rNas produced from a segment of the gene for 
β-actin, which is depicted schematically at the top. Millions of rNa “sequence reads,” 
each approximately 200 nucleotides long, were collected from a variety of cell types (right) 
and matched to DNa sequences within the β-actin gene. the height of each trace is 
proportional to how often each sequence appears in a read. exon sequences are present 
at high levels, reflecting their presence in mature β-actin mrNas. Intron sequences are 
present at low levels, most likely reflecting their presence in pre-mrNa molecules that 
have not yet been spliced or spliced introns that have not yet been degraded.

“ORF signal,” as it is not all that unusual for 50 random 
codons to lack a stop signal. Moreover, introns are so 
long that they are likely to contain by chance quite a bit 
of “ORF noise,” numerous stretches of sequence lacking 
stop signals. Finding the true ORFs in this sea of infor-
mation  in  which  the  noise  often  outweighs  the  signal 
can  be  difficult.  To  make  the  task  more  manageable, 
computers are used to search for other distinctive fea-
tures that mark the presence of a protein-coding gene. 
These  include  the  splicing  sequences  that  signal  an 
intron–exon  boundary  (see  Figure  7–19),  gene  regula-
tory sequences, or conservation with coding sequences 
from other organisms. 

regions 

In  1992,  researchers  used  a  computer  program  to 
predict  protein-coding 
in  a  preliminary 
human  sequence.  They  found  two  genes  in  a  58,000- 
nucleotide-pair  segment  of  Chromosome  4,  and 
five  genes  in  a  106,000 -nucleotide-pair  segment  of 
Chromosome 19. That works out to an average of 1 gene 
every  23,000  nucleotide  pairs.  Extrapolating  from  that 
density to the whole genome would give humans nearly 
130,000 genes. It turned out, however, that the chromo-
somes  the  researchers  analyzed  had  been  chosen  for 
sequencing precisely because they appeared to be gene-
rich. When the estimate was adjusted to take into account 
the gene-poor regions of the human genome—guessing 
that half of the human genome had maybe one-tenth of 
that  gene-rich  density—the  estimated  number  dropped 
to 71,000.

matching RNAs
Of course, these estimates are based on what we think 
genes look like; to get around this bias, we must employ 

more  direct,  experiment-based  methods  for  locating 
genes. Because genes are transcribed into RNA, the pre-
ferred strategy for finding genes involves isolating all of 
the RNAs produced by a particular cell type and deter-
mining  their  nucleotide  sequence—a  technique  called 
RNA Seq. These sequences are then mapped back to the 
genome to locate their genes. For protein-coding genes, 
exon segments are more highly represented among the 
sequenced  transcripts,  as  intron  sequences  tend  to  be 
spliced out and destroyed. Because different cell types 
express different genes, and splice their RNA transcripts 
differently, a variety of cell types are used in the analysis 
(Figure 9–37). 

RNA Seq also offers a few additional benefits. First, the 
relative  abundance  of  each  sequence  can  be  used  to 
assess  how  highly  its  gene  is  expressed.  Furthermore, 
the approach also locates genes that do not code for pro-
teins, but instead encode functional or regulatory RNAs. 
Many noncoding RNAs were first identified through RNA 
Seq. 

human gene countdown

Based  on  a  combination  of  all  of  these  computational 
and  experimental  techniques,  current  estimates  of  the 
number  of  human  genes  are  now  converging  around 
30,000.  It  could  be  many  years,  however,  before  we 
have  the  final  answer  to  how  many  genes  it  takes  to 
make a human. In the end, having an exact count will 
not be nearly as important as understanding the func-
tions  of  each  gene  and  how  they  interact  to  build  the 
living organism.

CHapter 9     how Genes and Genomes evolve

exhibiting  the  most  rapid  change  (18  changes  between  human  and 
chimp,  compared  with  only  two  changes  between  chimp  and  chicken) 
was examined further and found to encode a short, non-protein-coding 
RNA that is produced in the human cerebral cortex at a critical time during 
brain development. Although the function of this RNA is not yet known, 
this  exciting  finding  is  stimulating  further  studies  that  might  help  shed 
light on features of the human brain that distinguish us from chimps.

Similar  studies  have  identified  genes  that  may  have  played  a  role  in 
even  more  recent  human  evolution.  In  2010,  investigators  completed 
their analysis of the first Neanderthal genome. Our closest evolutionary 
relative,  Neanderthals  lived  side  by  side  with  the  ancestors  of  modern 
humans  in  Europe  and  Western  Asia.  By  comparing  the  Neanderthal 
genome sequence—obtained from DNA that was extracted from a fossil-
ized bone fragment found in a cave in Croatia—with those of five people 
from different parts of the world, the researchers identified a handful of 
genomic regions that have undergone a sudden spurt of changes in mod-
ern humans. These regions include genes involved in metabolism, brain 
development, and the shape of the skeleton, particularly the rib cage and 
head—all  features  thought  to  differ  between  modern  humans  and  our 
extinct cousins. 

Remarkably,  these  studies  also  revealed  that  some  modern  humans—
those that hail from Europe and Asia—share from 1 to 4 percent of their 
genomes  with  Neanderthals.  This  genetic  overlap  suggests  that  our 
ancestors may have mated with Neanderthals—before outcompeting or 
actively exterminating them—on the way out of Africa, a relationship that 
left a permanent mark in the human genome. 

Genome Variation Contributes to Our Individuality—But 
how?
With the possible exception of some identical twins, no two people have 
exactly the same genome sequence. When the same region of the genome 
from two different humans is compared, the nucleotide sequences typi-
cally  differ  by  about  0.1%.  That  might  seem  an  insignificant  degree  of 
variation, but considering the size of the human genome, it amounts to 
some 3 million genetic differences per genome between one person and 
the next. Detailed analyses of human genetic variation suggest that the 
bulk  of  this  variation  was  already  present  early  in  our  evolution,  per-
haps 100,000 years ago, when the human population was still small. This 
means that a great deal of the genetic variation in present-day humans 
was inherited from our early human ancestors.

Most  of  the  genetic  variation  in  the  human  genome  takes  the  form  of 
single  base  changes  called  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs, 
pronounced  snips).  These  polymorphisms  are  simply  points  in  the 
genome  that  differ  in  nucleotide  sequence  between  one  portion  of  the 
population and another—positions where more than 1% of the popula-
tion has a G-C nucleotide pair, for example, while another has an A-T 
(Figure 9–38). Two human genomes chosen at random from the world’s 
population will differ by approximately 2.5 × 106 SNPs that are scattered 
throughout the genome. 

Another  important  source  of  variation  inherited  from  our  ancestors 
involves the duplication and deletion of large segments of DNA. When 
the  genome  of  any  person  is  compared  with  a  standard  reference 
genome, one observes roughly 100 instances in which a relatively long 
stretch  of  DNA  has  been  gained  or  lost.  Some  of  these  copy-number 
variations  (CNVs)  are  very  common,  whereas  others  are  present  in 
only a small minority of people. From an initial sampling, nearly half of 

examining the human Genome

Figure 9–38 Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (Snps) are points in the 
genome that differ by a single nucleotide 
pair between one portion of the 
population and another. By convention, 
to count as a polymorphism, a genetic 
difference must be present in at least 1% of 
the total population of the species. Most, 
but not all, SNps in the human genome 
occur in regions where they do not affect 
the function of a gene. as indicated, when 
comparing any two humans one finds, on 
average, about one SNp per every 1000 
nucleotide pairs.

these segments contain known genes and can affect one’s susceptibility 
to certain diseases. In retrospect, this type of structural variation is not 
surprising, given the extensive history of DNA addition and DNA loss in 
vertebrate genomes discussed earlier. Exactly how it contributes to our 
individuality, however, remains to be determined.

ECB4 e9.31/9.37

In addition to the SNPs and the CNVs that we inherited from our ancestors, 
humans  also  possess  repetitive  nucleotide  sequences  that  are  particu-
larly  prone  to  new  mutations.  CA  repeats,  for  example,  are  ubiquitous 
in the human genome. Nucleotide sequences containing large numbers 
of CA repeats are often replicated inaccurately (imagine trying to copy a 
word that is nothing more than a string of CACACACAC…); hence, the 
precise length of such repeats can vary widely between individuals and 
can increase from one generation to the next. Because they show such 
exceptional variability, and because this variability has arisen so recently 
in human history, CA repeats, and others like them, make ideal markers 
for distinguishing the DNA of individual humans. For this reason, differ-
ences in the numbers of short tandem repeats at different positions in the 
genome  are  used  to  identify  individuals  by  DNA  fingerprinting  in  crime 
investigations, paternity suits, and other forensic applications (see Figure 
10–18).

Most  of  the  variations  in  the  human  genome  sequence  are  genetically 
silent, as they fall within noncritical regions of the genome. Such vari-
ations  have  no  effect  on  how  we  look  or  how  our  cells  function.  This 
means that only a small subset of the variation we observe in our DNA 
is responsible for the heritable differences from one human to the next. 
It remains a major challenge to identify those genetic variations that are 
functionally important—a problem we return to in Chapter 19.

Differences in Gene Regulation may help Explain how 
Animals With similar Genomes Can Be so Different
The finding that humans, chimps, and mice contain essentially the same 
protein-coding  genes  has  raised  a  fundamental  question:  What  makes 
these creatures so different from one another?

To a large extent, the instructions needed to produce a multicellular ani-
mal from a fertilized egg are provided by the regulatory DNA associated 
with  each  gene.  These  noncoding  DNA  sequences  contain,  scattered 
within  them,  dozens  of  separate  regulatory  elements,  including  short 
DNA segments that serve as binding sites for specific transcription regu-
lators (discussed in Chapter 8). Regulatory DNA ultimately dictates each 
organism’s developmental program—the rules its cells follow as they pro-
liferate, assess their positions in the embryo, and specialize by switching 
on  and  off  specific  genes  at  the  right  time  and  place.  The  evolution  of 
species is likely to have more to do with innovations in gene regulatory 
sequences than in the proteins or functional RNAs those genes encode.

produced from the Dscam gene. Only one

Although we have made great strides in recognizing many of these regu-
latory sequences amidst the excess of noncritical “spacer” DNA, we still 
do not know how to “read” these sequences so that we can predict exactly 
how they operate in cells to control development. For example, the same 
short stretch of regulatory DNA may be recognized by several different 
transcription regulators, so simply knowing its nucleotide sequence will 
not  reveal  which  transcription  regulator—or  regulators—might  bind  to 
the sequence in a particular cell at a particular time or place. In addition, 
gene expression is controlled by complex combinations of proteins (see 
Figure 8–12), which further complicates our attempts to decipher when in 
development and in which type of cell any given gene will be expressed.

ECB4 e9.32/9.38

Even  if  we  could  predict  when  a  particular  protein-coding  gene  would 
be expressed, we would not necessarily be able to predict what protein 
that gene would produce. Recent studies suggest that more than 90% of 
human  genes  undergo  alternative  RNA  splicing,  which  allows  cells  to 
produce a range of related but distinct proteins from a single gene (see 
Figure 7–22). RNA splicing is often regulated, so that one form of a protein 
is produced in one type of cell, while other forms are produced prefer-
entially in other cell types. In one extreme example, from Drosophila, a 
single gene can produce thousands of different protein variants through 
alternative RNA splicing (Figure 9–39). Thus an organism can produce 
far more proteins than it has genes. We do not yet know enough about 
alternative  splicing  to  predict  exactly  which  human  genes  are  subject 
to  this  process—and  when,  where,  and  how  during  development  such 
regulation occurs. Nonetheless, it seems likely that these differences in 
alternative RNA splicing could help explain how animals with very simi-
lar protein-coding genes develop so differently.

Another part of the explanation may involve regulatory RNAs, such as the 
microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs discussed in Chapter 8. Thus for 
example, microRNAs have diverse roles in controlling gene expression, 
especially  during  development.  They  regulate  as  many  as  one-third  of 
all human genes, for example, yet few of them have been studied in any 
detail—and new ones are still being found. And even less is known about 
the long noncoding RNAs.

The  information  that  guides  the  countless  decisions  made  by  develop-
ing cells as they divide and specialize is all contained within the genome 
sequence  of  an  organism.  But  we  are  only  just  beginning  to  learn  the 
grammar and rules by which this genetic information orchestrates devel-
opment. Deciphering this code—which has been shaped by evolution and 
refined by individual variation—is one of the great challenges facing the 
next generation of cell biologists.

EssENTIAl CONCEPTs
•	 By comparing the DNA and protein sequences of contemporary organ-
isms, we are beginning to reconstruct how genomes have evolved in 
the billions of years that have elapsed since the appearance of the 
first cells.

•		 Genetic	variation—the	raw	material	for	evolutionary	change—arises	
through a variety of mechanisms that alter the nucleotide sequence of 
genomes. These changes in sequence range from simple point muta-
tions to larger-scale deletions, duplications, and rearrangements.

•	 Genetic	changes	that	give	an	organism	a	selective	advantage	are	the	
most likely to be perpetuated. Changes that compromise an organ-
ism’s fitness or ability to reproduce are eliminated through natural 
selection.

•	 Gene	 duplication	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 important	 sources	 of	 genetic	
diversity. Once duplicated, the two genes can accumulate different 
mutations and thereby diversify to perform different roles. 

•	 Repeated	 rounds	 of	 gene	 duplication	 and	 divergence	 during	 evolu-

tion have produced many large gene families.

•	 The	evolution	of	new	proteins	is	thought	to	have	been	greatly	facili-
tated  by  the  swapping  of  exons  between  genes  to  create  hybrid 
proteins with new functions.

•	 The	human	genome	contains	3.2	×	109 nucleotide pairs distributed 
among	 23	 pairs	 of	 chromosomes—22	 autosomes	 and	 a	 pair	 of	 sex	
chromosomes. Less than a tenth of this DNA is transcribed to pro-
duce protein-coding or otherwise functional RNAs. 
Individual	humans	differ	from	one	another	by	an	average	of	1	nucle-
otide	pair	in	every	1000;	this	and	other	genetic	variation	underlies	
most of our individuality and provides the basis for identifying indi-
viduals by DNA analysis.

•	

•	 Nearly	half	of	the	human	genome	consists	of	mobile	genetic	elements	
that can move from one site to another within a genome. Two classes 
of these elements have multiplied to especially high copy numbers.

•	 Viruses	are	genes	packaged	in	protective	coats	that	can	move	from	
cell to cell and organism to organism, but they require host cells to 
reproduce themselves.

•	 Some	 viruses	 have	 RNA	 instead	 of	 DNA	 as	 their	 genetic	 material.	
Retroviruses  copy  their  RNA  genomes  into  DNA  before  integrating 
into the host-cell genome. 

•	 Comparing	genome	sequences	of	different	species	provides	a	power-
ful way to identify conserved, functionally important DNA sequences.
•	 Related	 species,	 such	 as	 human	 and	 mouse,	 have	 many	 genes	 in	
common;	 evolutionary	 changes	 in	 the	 regulatory	 DNA	 sequences	
that affect how these genes are expressed are especially important in 
determining the differences between species.

mobile genetic elements make up nearly half of the human

Chromosome 2 (Figure Q9–10). This cluster is about

animals). Why do you suppose that mobile genetic elements 
are so rare in this cluster? In figure Q9–10, lines that project

QuEsTION 9–14
Why do you expect to encounter a stop codon about every 
20 codons or so in a random sequence of DNA?

QuEsTION 9–15
The genetic code (see figure 7–25) relates the nucleotide 
sequence of mRNA to the amino acid sequence of encoded 
proteins. Ever since the code was deciphered, some have 
claimed it must be a frozen accident—that is, the system 
randomly fell into place in some ancestral organism and was 
then perpetuated unchanged throughout evolution; others 
have argued that the code has been shaped by natural 
selection. 
   A striking feature of the genetic code is its inherent 
resistance to the effects of mutation. for example, a change 
in the third position of a codon often specifies the same 
amino acid or one with similar chemical properties. But 
is the natural code more resistant to mutation than other 
possible versions? The answer is an emphatic “yes,” as 
illustrated in Figure Q9–15. Only one in a million computer-
generated “random” codes is more error-resistant than the 
natural genetic code.  
   Does the resistance to mutation of the actual genetic code 
argue in favor of its origin as a frozen accident or as a result 
of natural selection? Explain your reasoning.

some genes evolve more rapidly than others. But how 
can this be demonstrated? One approach is to compare 
several genes from the same two species, as shown for 
rat and human in the table above. Two measures of rates 
of nucleotide substitution are indicated in the table. 
Nonsynonymous changes refer to single-nucleotide changes 
in the DNA sequence that alter the encoded amino acid 
(ATC → TTC, which gives isoleucine → phenylalanine, for 
example). synonymous changes refer to those that do not 
alter the encoded amino acid (ATC → ATT, which gives 
isoleucine → isoleucine, for example). (As is apparent in 
the genetic code, figure 7–25, there are many cases where 
several codons correspond to the same amino acid.)

rates were determined by comparing rat and human 
sequences and are expressed as nucleotide changes per site 
per 109 years. the average rate of nonsynonymous changes 
for several dozen rat and human genes is about 0.8.

A.  Why are there such large differences between the 
synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of nucleotide 
substitution?
B.  Considering that the rates of synonymous changes are 
about the same for all three genes, how is it possible for 
the histone h3 gene to resist so effectively those nucleotide 
changes that alter its amino acid sequence?
C.  In principle, a protein might be highly conserved 
because its gene exists in a “privileged” site in the genome 
that is subject to very low mutation rates. What feature of 
the data in the table argues against this possibility for the 
histone h3 protein?

Plant hemoglobins were found initially in legumes, 
where they function in root nodules to lower the oxygen 
concentration, allowing the resident bacteria to fix nitrogen. 
These hemoglobins impart a characteristic pink color to the 
root nodules.The discovery of hemoglobin in plants was 
initially surprising because scientists regarded hemoglobin 
as a distinctive feature of animal blood. It was hypothesized 
that the plant hemoglobin gene was acquired by horizontal 
transfer from an animal. many more hemoglobin genes have 
now been sequenced from a variety of organisms, and a 
phylogenetic tree of hemoglobins is shown in Figure Q9–18.
A.  Does the evidence in the tree support or refute the 
hypothesis that the plant hemoglobins arose by horizontal 
gene transfer?
B.  supposing that the plant hemoglobin genes were 
originally derived by horizontal transfer (from a parasitic 
nematode, for example), what would you expect the 
phylogenetic tree to look like?

The accuracy of DNA replication in the human germ-cell  
line is such that on average only about 0.6 out of the  
6 billion nucleotides is altered at each cell division. Because 
most of our DNA is not subject to any precise constraint 
on its sequence, most of these changes are selectively 
neutral. Any two modern humans picked at random will 
show about 1 difference of nucleotide sequence in every 
1000 nucleotides. suppose we are all descended from 
a single pair of ancestors—Adam and Eve—who were 
genetically identical and homozygous (each chromosome 
was identical to its homolog). Assuming that all germ-line 
mutations that arise are preserved in descendants, how 
many cell generations must have elapsed since the days of 
Adam and Eve for 1 difference per 1000 nucleotides to have 
accumulated in modern humans? Assuming that each human 
generation corresponds on average to 200 cell-division 
cycles in the germ-cell lineage and allowing 30 years per

Modern Recombinant  
DNA Technology

Since the turn of the century, biologists have amassed an unprecedented 
wealth  of  information  on  the  genes  that  direct  the  development  and 
behavior  of  living  things.  Thanks  to  advances  in  our  ability  to  rapidly 
determine  the  nucleotide  sequence  of  entire  genomes,  we  now  have 
access  to  the  complete  molecular  blueprints  for  thousands  of  different 
organisms, from the platypus to the plague bacterium, and for thousands 
of different people from all over the world. 

This  information  explosion  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the 
technological revolution that enabled us to manipulate DNA molecules. 
In  the  early  1970s,  it  became  possible,  for  the  first  time,  to  isolate  a 
selected  piece  of  DNA  from  the  many  millions  of  nucleotide  pairs  in  a 
typical chromosome—and to replicate, sequence, and modify this DNA. 
These  modified  DNA  molecules  can  then  be  introduced  into  another 
organism’s genome, where they become a functional and heritable part 
of that organism’s genetic instructions.

These technical breakthroughs—dubbed recombinant DNA technology, 
or genetic engineering—have had a dramatic impact on all aspects of cell 
biology. They have advanced our understanding of the organization and 
evolutionary  history  of  complex  eukaryotic  genomes  (as  discussed  in 
Chapter 9) and have led to the discovery of whole new classes of genes, 
RNAs, and proteins. They continue to generate new ways of determin-
ing  the  functions  of  genes  and  proteins  in  living  organisms,  and  they 
provide  an important set of tools for unraveling the mechanisms—still 
poorly understood—by which a complex organism can develop from a 
single fertilized egg.

Recombinant DNA technology has also had a profound influence on our 
understanding and treatment of disease: it is used, for example, to detect

the mutations in human genes that are responsible for inherited disor-
ders  or  that  predispose  us  to  a  variety  of  common  diseases,  including 
cancer; it is used to produce an increasing number of pharmaceuticals, 
such as insulin for diabetics and blood-clotting proteins for hemophiliacs. 
But recombinant DNA technology also has applications outside the clinic. 
It allows, for example, forensic science to identify or acquit suspects in a 
crime. Even our laundry detergents contain heat-stable, stain-removing 
proteases, courtesy of DNA technology. Of all the discoveries described 
in this book, those that led to the development of recombinant DNA tech-
nology have the greatest impact on our everyday lives.

In  this  chapter,  we  present  a  brief  overview  of  how  we  learned  to 
manipulate DNA, identify genes, and produce many copies of any given 
nucleotide sequence in the laboratory. We discuss several approaches to 
exploring gene function, including new ways to monitor gene expression 
and  to  inactivate  or  modify  genes  in  cells,  animals,  and  plants.  These 
methods—which are continuously being improved and made ever-more 
powerful—are  not  only  revolutionizing  the  way  we  do  science,  they 
are transforming our understanding of cell biology and human disease. 
Indeed, they are responsible for a substantial portion of the information 
we present in this book.

manipulating and analyzing dna 
molecules 
Humans have been experimenting with DNA, albeit without realizing it, 
for millennia. The roses in our gardens, the corn on our plate, and the 
dogs in our yards are all the product of selective breeding that has taken 
place over many, many generations (Figure 10–1). But it wasn’t until the 
development of recombinant DNA techniques in the 1970s that we could 
begin to engineer organisms with desired properties by directly tinkering 
with their genes.

Isolating and manipulating individual genes is not a trivial matter. Unlike 
a protein, a gene does not exist as a discrete entity in cells; it is a small 
part of a much larger DNA molecule. Even bacterial genomes, which are 
much less complex than the chromosomes of eukaryotes, are enormously 
long.  The  E.  coli  genome,  for  example,  contains  4.6  million  nucleotide 
pairs. 

How, then, can a single gene be separated from a eukaryotic genome—
which is considerably larger—so that it can be handled in the laboratory? 
The solution to this problem emerged, in large part, with the discovery 
of  a  class  of  bacterial  enzymes  known  as  restriction  nucleases.  These

enzymes  cut  double-stranded  DNA  at  particular  sequences.  They  can 
therefore be used to produce a reproducible set of specific DNA fragments 
from any genome. In this section, we describe how these enzymes work 
and how the DNA fragments they produce can be separated and visual-
ized. We then discuss how these fragments can be probed to identify the 
ones that contain the DNA sequence of interest.

restriction nucleases cut dna molecules at specific sites
Like many of the tools of recombinant DNA technology, restriction nucle-
ases were discovered by researchers trying to understand an intriguing 
biological phenomenon. It had been observed that certain bacteria always 
degraded “foreign” DNA that was introduced into them experimentally. A 
search for the mechanism responsible revealed a novel class of bacterial 
nucleases that cleave DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. The bacte-
ria’s  own  DNA  is  protected  from  cleavage  by  chemical  modification  of 
these specific sequences. Because these enzymes function to restrict the 
transfer of DNA between strains of bacteria, they were called restriction 
nucleases. The pursuit of this seemingly arcane biological puzzle set off 
the development of technologies that have forever changed the way cell 
and molecular biologists study living things.

Different bacterial species produce different restriction nucleases, each 
cutting at a different, specific nucleotide sequence (Figure 10–2). Because 
these  target  sequences  are  short—generally  four  to  eight  nucleotide 
pairs—many sites of cleavage will occur, purely by chance, in any long 
DNA molecule. The reason restriction nucleases are so useful in the labo-
ratory  is  that  each  enzyme  will  cut  a  particular  DNA  molecule,  at  the 
same sites. Thus for a given sample of DNA, a particular restriction nucle-
ase will reliably generate the same set of DNA fragments. 

The size of the resulting fragments depends on the target sequences of 
the  restriction  nucleases.  As  shown  in  Figure  10–2,  the  enzyme  HaeIII 
cuts at a sequence of four nucleotide pairs; a sequence this long would be 
expected to occur purely by chance approximately once every 256 nucle-
otide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target 
sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA 
on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48). This difference 
in sequence selectivity makes it possible to cleave a long DNA molecule 
into the fragment sizes that are most suitable for a given application.

Figure 10–2 Restriction nucleases cleave 
DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. 
target sequences are often palindromic 
(that is, the nucleotide sequence is 
symmetrical around a central point). here, 
both strands of the DNa double helix 
are cut at specific points within the target 
sequence (orange). Some enzymes, such as 
haeIII, cut straight across the double helix 
and leave two blunt-ended DNa molecules; 
with others, such as ecorI and hindIII, 
the cuts on each strand are staggered. 
these staggered cuts generate “sticky 
ends”—short, single-stranded overhangs 
that help the cut DNa molecules join back 
together through complementary base-
pairing. this rejoining of DNa molecules 
becomes important for DNa cloning, as 
we discuss later. restriction nucleases are 
usually obtained from bacteria, and their 
names reflect their origins: for example, the 
enzyme ecorI comes from Escherichia coli.

Because larger fragments migrate more

the basis of their length by gel electrophoresis—the same method used to 
separate mixtures of proteins (see Panel 4–5, p. 167). A mixture of DNA 
fragments is loaded at one end of a slab of agarose or polyacrylamide 
gel, which contains a microscopic network of pores. When a voltage is 
applied  across  the  gel,  the  negatively  charged  DNA  fragments  migrate 
toward the positive electrode; larger fragments will migrate more slowly 
because their progress is impeded to a greater extent by the gel matrix. 
Over several hours, the DNA fragments become spread out across the gel 
according to size, forming a ladder of discrete bands, each composed of a 
collection of DNA molecules of identical length (Figure 10–3). To isolate a  
desired DNA fragment, the small section of the gel that contains the band 
is excised with a scalpel or a razor blade, and the DNA is then extracted.

bands of dna in a gel can be Visualized using 
fluorescent dyes or radioisotopes 
The separated DNA bands on an agarose or polyacrylamide gel are not, 
by themselves, visible. To see these bands, the DNA must be labeled or 
stained in some way. One sensitive method involves exposing the gel to 
a dye that fluoresces under ultraviolet (UV) light when it is bound to DNA. 
When the gel is placed on a UV light box, the individual bands glow bright 
orange—or bright white when the gel is photographed in black and white 
(see Figure 10–3B). 

An  even  more  sensitive  detection  method  involves  incorporating  a 
radioisotope  into  the  DNA  molecules  before  they  are  separated  by 
electrophoresis; 32P is often used, as it can be incorporated into the phos-
phates of DNA. Because the β particles emitted from 32P can activate the 
radiation-sensitive particles in photographic film, a sheet of film placed 
flat on top of the agarose gel will, when developed, show the position of 
all the DNA bands. 

Exposing a gel to a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA—or starting with 
DNA that has been pre-labeled with 32P—will allow every band on the gel 
to be seen. But it does not reveal which of those bands contains a DNA 
sequence of interest. To do that, a probe is designed to bind specifically 
to the desired nucleotide sequence by complementary base-pairing, as 
we see next.

Hybridization provides a sensitive Way to detect specific 
nucleotide sequences 
Under normal conditions, the two strands of a DNA double helix are held 
together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs (see 
Figure 5–6). But these relatively weak, noncovalent bonds can be fairly 
easily broken. Such DNA denaturation will release the two strands from 
each other, but does not break the covalent bonds that link together the 
nucleotides within each strand. Perhaps the simplest way to achieve this 
separation involves heating the DNA to around 90ºC. When the conditions 
are reversed—by slowly lowering the temperature—the complementary 
strands will readily come back together to re-form a double helix. This 
hybridization, or DNA renaturation, is driven by the re-formation of the 
hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (Figure 10–4).

This  fundamental  capacity  of  a  single-stranded  nucleic  acid  molecule, 
either DNA or RNA, to form a double helix with a single-stranded mole-
cule of a complementary sequence provides a very powerful and sensitive 
technique  for  detecting  specific  nucleotide  sequences  in  both  DNA  and 
RNA. Today, one simply designs a short, single-stranded DNA probe that 
is  complementary  to  the  nucleotide  sequence  of  interest.  Because  the 
nucleotide sequences of so many genomes are known—and are stored in 
publicly accessible databases—designing such a probe is straightforward. 
The desired probe can then be synthesized in the laboratory—usually by a

molecules to hybridize, they must have 
complementary nucleotide sequences that 
allow base-pairing. In this example, the red 
and orange strands are complementary to 
each other, and the blue and green strands 
are complementary to each other. although 
denaturation by heating is shown, DNa can 
also be renatured after being denatured by 
alkali treatment. the 1961 discovery that 
single strands of DNa could readily re-form 
a double helix in this way was a big surprise 
to scientists.

In this process, a stack of absorbent paper

DNa fragments from the gel to the

(e) the sheet is washed thoroughly, so that 
only probe molecules that have hybridized 
to the DNa on the paper remain attached. 
after autoradiography, the DNa that has 
hybridized to the labeled probe will show 
up as a band on the autoradiograph. an 
adaptation of this technique, used to detect 
specific rNa sequences, is called Northern 
blotting. In this case, rNa molecules are 
electrophoresed through the gel, and the 
probe is usually a single-stranded DNa 
molecule. the same procedures can be 
carried out with non-radioactive probes 
using an appropriate method of detection.

commercial organization or a centralized academic facility. Such probes 
carry a fluorescent or radioactive label to facilitate detection of the nucle-
otide sequence to which they bind.

Once a suitable probe has been obtained, it can be used in a variety of 
situations to search for nucleic acids with a complementary sequence—
for example, finding a sequence of interest among DNA fragments that 
have been separated on an agarose gel. In this case, the fragments are 
first transferred to a special sheet of paper, which is then exposed to the 
labeled  probe.  This  common  technique,  called  Southern  blotting,  was 
named after the scientist who invented it (Figure 10–5). 

DNA probes are widely used in cell biology. Later in the chapter, we dis-
ECB4 E10.05/10.06
cuss how they can be used to determine in which tissues and at what 
stages of development a gene is transcribed. But first, we consider how 
hybridization facilitates the process of DNA cloning. 

dna cloning in bacteria
The term DNA cloning refers to the production of many identical cop-
ies of a DNA sequence. It is this amplification that makes it possible to 
separate a defined segment of DNA—often a gene of interest—from the 
rest of a cell’s genome. DNA cloning is one of the most important feats of 
recombinant DNA technology, as it is the starting point for understanding 
the function of any stretch of DNA within the genome.

In  this  section,  we  describe  the  classical  approach  to  DNA  cloning,  in 
which one copies all of the DNA from a cell or tissue and then finds and 
isolates the specific DNA of interest. Later, we discuss how the develop-
ment of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has facilitated a more direct 

approach to cloning, allowing one to copy, in a test tube, only the DNA 
fragment of interest. 

dna cloning begins with genome fragmentation and 
production of recombinant dnas
Whole genomes, even small ones, are too large and unwieldy to be han-
dled easily in the laboratory. Thus the first step in cloning any gene is to 
break  the  genome  into  smaller,  more  manageable  pieces.  These  frag-
ments can then be joined together, or recombined, to produce the DNA 
molecules  that  will  be  amplified.  Our  ability  to  generate  such  recom-
binant DNA molecules is made possible by the use of molecular tools 
that are provided by cells themselves. 

As we discussed earlier, bacterial restriction nucleases can be used to cut 
long DNA molecules into conveniently sized fragments (see Figure 10–2). 
These fragments can then be joined to one another—or to any piece of 
DNA—using DNA ligase, an enzyme that reseals the nicks that arise in 
the DNA backbone during DNA replication and DNA repair in cells (see 
Figure  6–18).  DNA  ligase  allows  investigators  to  join  together  any  two 
pieces of DNA in a test tube, producing recombinant DNA molecules that 
are not found in nature (Figure 10–6). 

The production of recombinant DNA molecules in this way is a key step 
in the classical approach to DNA cloning. It allows the DNA fragments 
generated  by  treatment  with  a  restriction  nuclease  to  be  inserted  into 
another, special DNA molecule that serves as a carrier, or vector, which 
can be copied—and thereby amplified—inside a cell, as we discuss next. 

recombinant dna can be inserted into plasmid Vectors 
The vectors typically used for gene cloning are relatively small, circular 
DNA  molecules  called  plasmids.  (Figure  10–7).  Each  plasmid  contains 
a replication origin, which enables it to replicate in a bacterial cell inde-
pendently  of  the  bacterial  chromosome.  It  also  has  cleavage  sites  for 
common restriction nucleases, so that the plasmid can be conveniently 
opened and a foreign DNA fragment inserted. 

The  plasmids  used  for  cloning  are  basically  streamlined  versions  of 
plasmids that occur naturally in many bacteria. Bacterial plasmids were 
first  recognized  by  physicians  and  scientists  because  they  often  carry

necessary for the ligase to reseal the 
sugar–phosphate backbone of DNa. 
(a) DNa ligase can readily join two 
DNa fragments produced by the same 
restriction nuclease, in this case ecorI. 
Note that the staggered ends produced 
by this enzyme enable the ends of the 
two fragments to base-pair correctly 
with each other, greatly facilitating their 
rejoining. (B) DNa ligase can also be 
used to join DNa fragments produced 
by different restriction nucleases—for 
example, ecorI and haeIII. In this case, 
before the fragments undergo ligation, 
DNa polymerase plus a mixture of 
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
(dNtps) are used to fill in the staggered 
cut produced by ecorI. each DNa 
fragment shown in the figure is oriented 
so that its 5ʹ ends are the left end of the 
upper strand and the right end of the 
lower strand, as indicated.

Figure 10–7 Bacterial plasmids are commonly used as cloning 
vectors. this circular, double-stranded DNa molecule was the first 
plasmid for DNa cloning; it contains about nine thousand nucleotide 
pairs. the staining procedure used to make the DNa visible in this

actually is. (courtesy of Stanley N. cohen, Stanford University.) 

genes that render their microbial host resistant to one or more antibiot-
ics.  Indeed,  historically  potent  antibiotics—penicillin,  for  example—are 
no longer effective against many of today’s bacterial infections because 
plasmids that confer resistance to the antibiotic have spread among bac-
terial species by horizontal gene transfer (see Figure 9–14). 

To insert a piece of DNA into a plasmid vector, the purified plasmid DNA 
is opened up by a restriction nuclease that cleaves it at a single site, and 
the DNA fragment to be cloned is then spliced into that site using DNA 
ligase (Figure 10–8). This recombinant DNA molecule is now ready to be 
introduced into a bacterium, where it will be copied and amplified, as we 
see next.

recombinant dna can be copied inside bacterial cells
To  introduce  recombinant  DNA  into  a  bacterial  cell,  investigators  take 
advantage of the fact that some bacteria naturally take up DNA molecules 
present in their surroundings. The mechanism that controls this uptake 
is called transformation, because early observations suggested it could 
“transform” one bacterial strain into another. Indeed, the first proof that 
genes are made of DNA came from an experiment in which DNA puri-
fied from a pathogenic strain of pneumococcus was used to transform a 
harmless bacterium into a deadly one (see How We Know, pp. 174–176). 

In a natural bacterial population, a source of DNA for transformation is 
provided by bacteria that have died and released their contents, includ-
ing DNA, into the environment. In a test tube, however, bacteria such as  
E. coli can be coaxed to take up recombinant DNA that has been created 
in the laboratory. These bacteria are then suspended in a nutrient-rich 
broth and allowed to proliferate. 

Each time the bacterial population doubles—every 30 minutes or so—the 
number of copies of the recombinant DNA molecule also doubles. Thus, 
in  24  hours,  the  engineered  cells  will  produce  hundreds  of  millions  of 
copies of the plasmid, along with the DNA fragment it contains. The bac-
teria can then be split open (lysed) and the plasmid DNA purified from

The DNA fragment can be readily recovered by cutting it out of the plas-
mid DNA with the same restriction nuclease that was used to insert it, 
and then separating it from the plasmid DNA by gel electrophoresis (see 
Figure 10–3). Together, these steps allow the amplification and purifica-
tion of any segment of DNA from the genome of any organism.

genes can be isolated from a dna library 
Thus far, we have described the amplification of a single DNA fragment. 
In reality, when a genome is cut by a restriction nuclease, millions of dif-
ferent DNA fragments are generated. How can the single fragment that 
contains the DNA of interest be isolated from this collection? The solution 
involves introducing all of the fragments into bacteria and then selecting 
those bacterial cells that have amplified the desired DNA molecule.

The entire collection of DNA fragments can be ligated into plasmid vec-
tors, using conditions that favor the insertion of a single DNA fragment 
into each plasmid molecule. These recombinant plasmids are then intro-
duced into E. coli at a concentration that ensures that no more than one 
plasmid molecule is taken up by each bacterium. The collection of cloned 
DNA  fragments  in  this  bacterial  culture  is  known  as  a  DNA  library. 
Because  the  DNA  fragments  were  derived  directly  from  the  chromo-
somal DNA of the organism of interest, the resulting collection—called a 
genomic library—should represent the entire genome of that organism 
(Figure 10–10). 

To find a particular gene within this library, one can use a labeled DNA 
probe designed to bind specifically to part of the gene’s DNA sequence. 
Using  such  a  probe,  the  rare  bacterial  clones  in  the  DNA  library  that 
contain the gene—or a portion of it—can be identified by hybridization 
(Figure 10–11).

But before a gene has been cloned, how can one design a probe to detect 
it? In the early days of cloning, investigators wishing to study a protein-
coding gene would first determine at least part of the protein’s amino acid 
sequence.  By  applying  the  genetic  code  in  reverse,  they  could  use  this 
amino acid sequence to deduce the corresponding gene sequence, which 
allowed them to generate an appropriate DNA probe.

Figure 10–11 A bacterial colony carrying a particular DNA clone can be identified by hybridization. a replica of 
the arrangement of the bacterial colonies (clones) on the petri dish is made by pressing a piece of absorbent paper 
against the surface of the dish. this replica is treated with alkali (to lyse the cells and dissociate the plasmid DNa into 
single strands), and the paper is then hybridized to a highly radioactive DNa probe. those bacterial colonies that 
have bound the probe are identified by autoradiography. Living bacterial cells containing the plasmid can then be 
isolated from the original petri dish.

Many  genes  were  originally  identified  and  cloned  using  variations  on 
ECB4 E10.12/10.12
this basic approach. Now that the complete genome sequences of many 
organisms,  including  humans,  are  known,  however,  cloning  genes  is 
very much easier, faster, and cheaper. The sequence of any gene in an 
organism can be looked up in an electronic database, making it a simple 
matter to design a probe that can be synthesized to order. As we discuss 
shortly, gene cloning today is typically done directly on the original DNA 
sample, bypassing the use of a DNA library entirely.

cdna libraries represent the mrnas produced by 
particular cells
For many applications—for example, when attempting to clone a protein-
coding gene, it is advantageous to obtain the gene in a form that contains 
only the coding sequence; that is, a form that lacks the intron DNA. For 
some genes, the complete genomic clone—including introns and exons—
is too large and unwieldy to handle conveniently in the laboratory (see, 
for example, Figure 7–18B). What’s more, the bacterial or yeast cells typ-
ically  used  to  amplify  cloned  DNA  are  unable  to  remove  introns  from 
mammalian RNA transcripts. So if the goal is to use a cloned mammalian 
gene to produce a large amount of the protein it encodes, it is essential 
to use only the coding sequence of the gene. Fortunately, it is relatively 
simple to isolate a gene free of all its introns, by using a different type of 
DNA library, called a cDNA library. 

A  cDNA  library  is  similar  to  a  genomic  library  in  that  it  also  contains 
numerous clones containing many different DNA sequences. But it differs 
in one important respect. The DNA that goes into a cDNA library is not 
genomic DNA; it is DNA copied from the mRNAs present in a particular 
type of cell. To prepare a cDNA library, all of the mRNAs are extracted, 
and double-stranded DNA copies of these mRNAs are produced by the 
enzymes reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase (Figure 10–12). These 
complementary  DNA—or  cDNA—molecules  are  then  introduced  into 
bacteria  and  amplified,  as  described  for  genomic  DNA  fragments  (see 
Figure 10–10). The gene of interest—in this case, without its introns—can 
then be isolated by using a probe that hybridizes to the DNA sequence 
(see Figure 10–11). We discuss later how such cDNAs can be used to pro-
duce purified proteins on a commercial scale.

mrNa is extracted from a selected type of

DNa (cDNa) is produced using reverse 
transcriptase (see Figure 9–30) and DNa 
polymerase. For simplicity, the copying 
of just one of these mrNas into cDNa is 
illustrated here. Note that an rNa fragment 
that remains hybridized to the first cDNa 
strand after partial rNase digestion serves 
as the primer needed for DNa polymerase 
to begin synthesis of the complementary 
DNa strand.

There  are  several  important  differences  between  genomic  DNA  clones 
and cDNA clones, as illustrated in Figure 10–13. Genomic clones repre-
sent a random sample of all of the DNA sequences found in an organism’s 
genome and, with very rare exceptions, will contain the same sequences 
regardless  of  the  cell  type  from  which  the  DNA  came.  Also,  genomic 
clones from eukaryotes contain large amounts of noncoding DNA, repeti-
tive DNA sequences, introns, regulatory DNA, and spacer DNA; sequences 
that code for proteins will make up only a few percent of the library (see 
Figure 9–33). By contrast, cDNA clones contain predominantly protein-
coding sequences, and only those for genes that have been transcribed 
into mRNA in the cells from which the cDNA was made. As different types 
of cells produce distinct sets of mRNA molecules, each yields a different 
cDNA  library.  Furthermore,  patterns  of  gene  expression  change  during 
development, so cells at different stages in their development will also 
yield different cDNA libraries.

ECB4 e10.13/10.13

As we discuss later, cDNAs are used to assess which genes are expressed 
in specific cells, at particular times in development, or under a particular 
set of conditions. In contrast, genomic clones—which include introns and 
exons, as well as regulatory DNA sequences—provide the starting mat-
erial for determining the complete nucleotide sequence of an organism’s 
genome.

dna cloning by pcr
Genomic and cDNA libraries were once the only route to gene cloning, 
and they are still used for cloning very large genes and for sequencing 
whole genomes. However, a powerful and versatile method for amplify-
ing DNA, known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), provides a 

Question 10–3

discuss the following statement: 
“from the nucleotide sequence of 
a cdna clone, the complete amino 
acid sequence of a protein can be 
deduced by applying the genetic 
code. thus, protein biochemistry has 
become superfluous because there 
is nothing more that can be learned 
by studying the protein.”

ChApTER 10     Modern recombinant DNa technology

Figure 10–13 Genomic DNA clones and 
cDNA clones derived from the same 
region of the genome are different. 
In this example, gene a is infrequently 
transcribed, whereas gene B is frequently 
transcribed, and both genes contain introns 
(orange). In the genomic DNa library, both 
introns and nontranscribed DNa (gray) are 
included in the clones, and most clones 
will contain either no coding sequence or 
only part of the coding sequence of a gene 
(red ); the DNa sequences that regulate the 
expression of each gene are also included 
(not indicated). In the cDNa clones, the 
intron sequences have been removed by 
rNa splicing during the formation of the 
mrNa (blue), and a continuous coding 
sequence is therefore present in each 
clone. Because gene B is transcribed more 
frequently than gene a in the cells from 
which the cDNa library was made, it will 
be represented much more often than a 
in the cDNa library. In contrast, genes a 
and B should be represented equally in the 
genomic library.

more  rapid  and  straightforward  approach  to  DNA  cloning,  particularly 
in organisms whose complete genome sequence is known. Today, most 
genes are cloned via PCR. 

ECB4 E10.14/10.14

Invented  in  the  1980s,  PCR  revolutionized  the  way  that  DNA  and  RNA 
are analyzed. The technique can amplify any nucleotide sequence rap-
idly  and  selectively.  Unlike  the  traditional  approach  of  cloning  using 
vectors—which  relies  on  bacteria  to  make  copies  of  the  desired  DNA 
sequences—PCR is performed entirely in a test tube. Eliminating the need 
for bacteria makes PCR convenient and incredibly quick—billions of cop-
ies of a nucleotide sequence can be generated in a matter of hours. At the 
same time, PCR is remarkably sensitive: the method can be used to detect 
the trace amounts of DNA in a drop of blood left at a crime scene or in a 
few copies of a viral genome in a patient’s blood sample. Because of its 
sensitivity, speed, and ease of use, PCR has many applications in addition 
to DNA cloning, including forensics and diagnostics.

In this section, we provide a brief overview of how PCR works and how 
it is used for a range of purposes that require the amplification of specific 
DNA sequences.

pcr uses a dna polymerase to amplify selected dna 
sequences in a test tube
The success of PCR depends on the exquisite selectivity of DNA hybridi-
zation, along with the ability of DNA polymerase to copy a DNA template

reliably,  through  repeated  rounds  of  replication  in  vitro.  The  enzyme 
works by adding nucleotides to the 3ʹ end of a growing strand of DNA 
(see  Figure  6–11).  To  initiate  the  reaction,  the  polymerase  requires  a 
primer—a short nucleotide sequence that provides a 3ʹ end from which 
synthesis can begin. The beauty of PCR is that the primers that are added 
to the reaction mixture not only serve as starting points, they also direct 
the polymerase to the specific DNA sequence to be amplified. These prim-
ers, like the DNA probes used to identify specific nucleotide sequences as 
discussed earlier, are designed by the experimenter based on the DNA 
sequence  of  interest  and  then  synthesized  chemically.  Thus,  PCR  can 
only be used to clone a DNA segment for which the sequence is known 
in advance. With the large and growing number of genome sequences 
available in public databases, this requirement is rarely a drawback.

multiple cycles of amplification In Vitro generate billions 
of copies of the desired nucleotide sequence
PCR is an iterative process in which the cycle of amplification is repeated 
dozens of times. At the start of each cycle, the two strands of the double-
stranded DNA template are separated and a unique primer is annealed 
to each. DNA polymerase is then allowed to replicate each strand inde-
pendently (Figure 10–14). In subsequent cycles, all the newly synthesized 
DNA molecules produced by the polymerase serve as templates for the 
next round of replication (Figure 10–15). Through this iterative amplifica-
tion process, many copies of the original sequence can be made—billions 
after about 20 to 30 cycles. 

PCR is now the method of choice for cloning relatively short DNA frag-
ments (say, under 10,000 nucleotide pairs). Each cycle takes only about 
five minutes, and automation of the whole procedure enables cell-free 
cloning of a DNA fragment in a few hours, compared with the several 
days required for cloning in bacteria. The original template for PCR can 
be either DNA or RNA, so this method can be used to obtain either a full 
genomic clone (complete with introns and exons) or a cDNA copy of an 
mRNA (Figure 10–16). A major benefit of PCR is that genes can be cloned 
directly from any piece of DNA or RNA without the time and effort needed 
to first construct a DNA library.

Figure 10–14 A pair of pCR primers directs the amplification of a desired segment of DNA in a test tube. each cycle of pcr 
includes three steps: (1) the double-stranded DNa is heated briefly to separate the two strands. (2) the DNa is exposed to a large 
excess of a pair of specific primers—designed to bracket the region of DNa to be amplified—and the sample is cooled to allow the 
primers to hybridize to complementary sequences in the two DNa strands. (3) this mixture is incubated with DNa polymerase and the 
four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates so that DNa can be synthesized, starting from the two primers. the cycle can then be repeated 
by reheating the sample to separate the newly synthesized DNa strands (see Figure 10–15). 
   the technique depends on the use of a special DNa polymerase isolated from a thermophilic bacterium; this polymerase is stable at 
much higher temperatures than eukaryotic DNa polymerases, so it is not denatured by the heat treatment shown in step 1. the enzyme 
therefore does not have to be added again after each cycle.

Figure 10–15 pCR uses repeated rounds of strand separation, hybridization, and synthesis to amplify DNA. as 
the procedure outlined in Figure 10–14 is repeated, all the newly synthesized fragments serve as templates in their 
turn. Because the polymerase and the primers remain in the sample after the first cycle, pcr involves simply heating 
and then cooling the same sample, in the same test tube, again and again. each cycle doubles the amount of DNa 
synthesized in the previous cycle, so that within a few cycles, the predominant DNa is identical to the sequence 
bracketed by and including the two primers in the original template. In the example illustrated here, three cycles 
of reaction produce 16 DNa chains, 8 of which (boxed in yellow) correspond exactly to one or the other strand of 
the original bracketed sequence. after four more cycles, 240 of the 256 DNa chains will correspond exactly to the 
original sequence, and after several more cycles, essentially all of the DNa strands will be this length. the whole 
procedure is shown in movie 10.1.

Question 10–4

if the pcr shown in 

a. 
figure 10–15 is carried through 
an additional two rounds of 
amplification, how many of the dna 
fragments labeled in gray, green, 
or red or outlined in yellow are 
produced? if many additional cycles 
are carried out, which fragments will 
predominate? 
b.  assume you start with one 
double-stranded dna molecule 
and amplify a 500-nucleotide-pair 
sequence contained within it. 
approximately how many cycles 
of pcr amplification will you need 
to produce 100 ng of this dna? 
100 ng is an amount that can be 
easily detected after staining with 
a fluorescent dye. (Hint: for this 
calculation, you need to know that 
each nucleotide has an average 
molecular mass of 330 g/mole.)

pcr is also used for diagnostic and forensic applications
In  addition  to  its  use  in  gene  cloning,  PCR  is  frequently  employed  to 
amplify DNA for other, more practical purposes. Because of its extraor-
dinary sensitivity, PCR can be used to detect invading microorganisms at 
very early stages of infection. In this case, short sequences complemen-
tary to a segment of the infectious agent’s genome are used as primers, 
and  following  many  cycles  of  amplification,  even  a  few  copies  of  an 
invading bacterial or viral genome in a patient sample can be detected 
(Figure 10–17). For many infections, PCR has replaced the use of antibod-
ies against microbial molecules to detect the presence of pathogens. PCR 
can also be used to track epidemics, detect bioterrorist attacks, and test 
food products for the presence of potentially harmful microbes. It is also 
used to verify the authenticity of a food source—for example, whether a 
sample of beef actually came from a cow.

Finally,  PCR  is  now  widely  used  in  forensic  medicine.  The  method’s 
extreme  sensitivity  allows  forensic  investigators  to  isolate  DNA  from 
minute traces of human blood or other tissue to obtain a DNA fingerprint 
of the person who left the sample behind. With the possible exception 
of identical twins, the genome of each human differs in DNA sequence 
from that of every other person on Earth. Using primer pairs targeted at 
genome sequences that are known to be highly variable in the human 
population, PCR makes it possible to generate a distinctive DNA finger-
print  for  any  individual  (Figure  10–18).  Such  forensic  analyses  can  be 
used not only to point the finger at those who have done wrong, but—
equally important—to help exonerate those who have been wrongfully 
convicted.

Figure 10–16 pCR can be used to obtain

pcr to clone a segment of chromosomal 
DNa, total DNa is first purified from cells. 
pcr primers that flank the stretch of DNa 
to be cloned are added, and many cycles 
of pcr are completed (see Figure 10–15). 
Because only the DNa between (and 
including) the primers is amplified, pcr 
provides a way to obtain selectively any 
short stretch of chromosomal DNa in an 
effectively pure form. (B) to use pcr to

is first purified from cells. the first primer 
is added to the population of mrNas, and 
reverse transcriptase is used to make a DNa 
strand complementary to the specific rNa 
sequence of interest. the second primer 
is then added, and the DNa molecule is 
amplified through many cycles of pcr.

hIV, many other viruses that infect humans 
are now detected in this way.

Figure 10–18 pCR is used in forensic science to distinguish one individual from another. the DNa sequences analyzed are short 
tandem repeats (Strs) composed of sequences such as cacaca… or GtGtGt.... Strs are found in various positions (loci) in the human 
genome. the number of repeats in each Str locus is highly variable in the population, ranging from 4 to 40 in different individuals. 
Because of the variability in these sequences, individuals will usually inherit a different number of repeats at each Str locus from their 
mother and from their father; two unrelated individuals, therefore, rarely contain the same pair of sequences at a given Str locus.  
(a) pcr using primers that recognize unique sequences on either side of one particular Str locus produces a pair of bands of amplified 
DNa from each individual, one band representing the maternal Str variant and the other representing the paternal Str variant. the 
length of the amplified DNa, and thus its position after gel electrophoresis, will depend on the exact number of repeats at the locus. 
(B) In the schematic example shown here, the same three Str loci are analyzed in samples from three suspects (individuals a, B, and 
c), producing six bands for each individual. although different people can have several bands in common, the overall pattern is quite 
distinctive for each person. the band pattern can therefore serve as a DNA fingerprint to identify an individual nearly uniquely. the fourth 
lane (F) contains the products of the same pcr amplifications carried out on a hypothetical forensic DNa sample, which could have been 
obtained from a single hair or a tiny spot of blood left at a crime scene. 
   the more loci that are examined, the more confident one can be about the results. When examining the variability at 5–10 different Str 
loci, the odds that two random individuals would share the same fingerprint by chance are approximately one in 10 billion. In the case 
shown here, individuals a and c can be eliminated from inquiries, while B is a clear suspect. a similar approach is now used routinely in 
paternity testing.

an  investigator  chooses  often  depend  on  his  or  her  background  and 
training: a geneticist might, for example, engineer mutant organisms in 
which the activity of the gene has been disrupted, whereas a biochemist 
might take the same gene and produce large amounts of its protein to 
determine its three-dimensional structure. 

In  this  section,  we  present  a  few  of  the  methods  that  investigators 
currently  use  to  study  the  function  of  a  gene—all  of  which  depend  on 
recombinant  DNA  technology.  Because  a  gene’s  activity  is  specified  by 
its  nucleotide  sequence,  we  begin  by  outlining  the  techniques  used  to 
determine—and begin to interpret—the nucleotide sequence of a stretch 
of DNA. We then explore a variety of approaches for investigating when 
and where a gene is expressed. We describe how disrupting the activity of 
a gene in a cell, tissue, or whole plant or animal can provide insights into 
what that gene normally does. Finally, we explain how recombinant DNA 
technology can be harnessed to produce large amounts of any protein. 
Together, the methods we discuss have revolutionized all aspects of cell 
biology.

Whole genomes can be sequenced rapidly
In the late 1970s, researchers developed several schemes for determin-
ing,  simply  and  quickly,  the  nucleotide  sequence  of  any  purified  DNA 
fragment. The one that became the most widely used is called dideoxy 
sequencing or Sanger sequencing (after the scientist who invented it). 
The  technique  uses  DNA  polymerase,  along  with  special  chain-termi-
nating  nucleotides  called  dideoxyribonucleoside  triphosphates  (Figure 
10–19), to make partial copies of the DNA fragment to be sequenced. It 
ultimately produces a collection of different DNA copies that terminate at 
every position in the original DNA sequence. 

Until recently, these DNA copies, which differ in length by a single nucle-
otide, would then be separated by gel electrophoresis, and the nucleotide 
sequence of the original DNA would be determined manually from the 
order of labeled DNA fragments in the gel (Figure 10–20). These days, 
however, Sanger sequencing is fully automated: robotic devices mix the 
reagents—including  the  four  different  chain-terminating  dideoxynucle-
otides,  each  tagged  with  a  different-colored  fluorescent  dye—and  load 
the reaction samples onto long, thin capillary gels, which have replaced 
the flat gel slabs used since the 1970s. A detector then records the color 
of each band in the gel, and a computer translates the information into 
a nucleotide sequence (Figure 10–21). How such sequence information 
is then analyzed to assemble a complete genome sequence—for exam-
ple, the first draft of the human genome—is described in how We Know, 
pp. 344–345.

group. When incorporated into a growing DNa strand, they block further elongation 
of that strand.

ChApTER 10     Modern recombinant DNa technology

Figure 10–20 The Sanger method 
produces four sets of labeled DNA 
molecules. to determine the complete 
sequence of a single-stranded fragment of 
DNa (gray), the DNa is first hybridized with 
a short DNa primer (orange) that is labeled 
with a fluorescent dye or radioisotope. 
DNa polymerase and an excess of all four 
normal deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
(blue a, c, G, and t) are added to the 
primed DNa, which is then divided into four 
reaction tubes. each of these tubes receives 
a small amount of a single chain-terminating 
dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (red a, 
c, G, or t). Because the chain-terminating 
ddNtps will be incorporated only 
occasionally, each reaction produces a set 
of DNa copies that terminate at different 
points in the sequence. the products 
of these four reactions are separated by 
electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a 
polyacrylamide gel (labeled here a, t, c, 
and G). In each lane, the bands represent 
fragments that have terminated at a given 
nucleotide (e.g., a in the leftmost lane) 
but at different positions in the DNa. By 
reading off the bands in order, starting at 
the bottom of the gel and reading across 
all lanes, the DNa sequence of the newly 
synthesized strand can be determined. the 
sequence, which is given in the green arrow 
to the right of the gel, is complementary 
to the sequence of the original gray single-
stranded DNa, as shown on the bottom. 

Figure 10–21 Fully automated machines 
can set up and run Sanger sequencing 
reactions. (a) the automated method uses 
an excess amount of normal dNtps plus a 
mixture of four different chain-terminating 
ddNtps, each of which is labeled with a 
fluorescent tag of a different color. the 
reaction products are loaded onto a 
long, thin capillary gel and separated by 
electrophoresis. a camera reads the color 
of each band on the gel and feeds the data 
to a computer that assembles the sequence

next-generation sequencing techniques make genome 
sequencing faster and cheaper
The  Sanger  method  has  made  it  possible  to  sequence  the  genomes 
of  humans  and  of  many  other  organisms  including  most  of  those  dis-
cussed  in  this  book.  But  newer  methods,  developed  since  2005,  have 
made  genome  sequencing  even  more  rapid—and  very  much  cheaper. 
With these so-called second-generation sequencing methods, the cost of 
sequencing DNA has plummeted (Figure 10–22). At the same time, the 
number of genomes that have been sequenced has skyrocketed. These 
rapid methods allow multiple genomes to be sequenced in parallel in a 
matter of weeks, enabling investigators to examine thousands of human 
genomes,  catalog  the  variation  in  nucleotide  sequences  from  people 
around  the  world,  and  uncover  the  mutations  that  increase  the  risk  of 
various diseases—from cancer to autism—as we discuss in Chapter 19.

Although each method differs in detail, most rely on PCR amplification of 
a random collection of DNA fragments attached to a solid support, such 
as a glass slide or a microwell plate. For each fragment, the amplification 
generates  a  “cluster”  that  contains  about  1000  copies  of  an  individual 
DNA fragment. These clusters—tens of millions of which can fit on a sin-
gle slide or plate—are then sequenced at the same time (Figure 10–23).
Even more remarkable are the newest, third-generation sequencing meth-
ods, which permit the sequencing of just a single molecule of DNA. In one 
of  these  techniques,  for  example,  each  DNA  molecule  is  slowly  pulled 
through  a  very  tiny  channel,  like  thread  through  the  eye  of  a  needle. 
Because each of the four nucleotides has a different, characteristic shape, 
the  way  a  nucleotide  obstructs  the  pore  as  it  passes  through  reveals 

Figure 10–23 Second-generation sequencing methods rely on 
massively parallel sequencing reactions carried out on clusters of 
pCR-amplified DNA. each spot on a slide or plate contains about a 
thousand copies of a single DNa fragment. In the first step, the plate 
is incubated with DNa polymerase and a special set of four nucleoside 
triphosphates (Ntps) that terminate DNa synthesis in a reversible 
manner, each of which carries a fluorescent marker of a different color; 
no normal dNtps are present. a camera then images and records 
the fluorescence at each position on the plate. In the second step, 
the DNa is chemically treated to remove the fluorescent markers 
and chemical blockers from each nucleoside; strand synthesis then 
continues after a new batch of fluorescent Ntps is added. these steps 
are repeated until the sequence is complete. the snapshots of each 
round of synthesis are compiled by computer to yield the sequence of 
the cluster of fragments located at each of the potentially millions of 
positions on the plate.

hOW WE KNOW
SEQUENCING ThE hUMAN GENOME

When  DNA  sequencing  techniques  became  fully  auto-
mated,  determining  the  order  of  the  nucleotides  in  a 
piece of DNA went from being an elaborate Ph.D. thesis 
project to a routine laboratory chore. Feed DNA into the 
sequencing  machine,  add  the  necessary  reagents,  and 
out  comes  the  sought-after  result:  the  order  of  As,  Ts, 
Gs, and Cs. Nothing could be simpler.

copies  of  Essential  Cell  Biology  (ECB),  mixing  up  the 
pieces,  and  then  trying  to  put  one  whole  copy  of  the 
book back together again by matching up the words or 
phrases or sentences that appear on each piece. (Several 
copies would be needed to generate enough overlap for 
reassembly.) It could be done, but it would be much eas-
ier if the book were, say, only two pages long.

So  why  was  sequencing  the  human  genome  such  a 
formidable  task?  Largely  because  of  its  size.  The  DNA 
sequencing  methods  employed  at  the  time  were  lim-
ited by the physical size of the gel used to separate the 
labeled  fragments  (see  Figure  10–20).  At  most,  only  a 
few hundred nucleotides could be read from a single gel. 
How, then, do you handle a genome that contains bil-
lions of nucleotide pairs?

The solution is to break the genome into fragments and 
sequence these smaller pieces. The main challenge then 
comes  in  piecing  the  short  fragments  together  in  the 
correct  order  to  yield  a  comprehensive  sequence  of  a 
whole  chromosome,  and  ultimately  a  whole  genome. 
There  are  two  main  strategies  for  accomplishing  this 
genomic breakage and reassembly: the shotgun method 
and the clone-by-clone approach.

shotgun sequencing
The  most  straightforward  approach  to  sequencing  a 
genome is to break it into random fragments, separate 
and  sequence  each  of  the  single-stranded  fragments, 
and then use a powerful computer to order these pieces 
using sequence overlaps to guide the assembly (Figure 
10–24).  This  approach  is  called  the  shotgun  sequenc-
ing strategy. As an analogy, imagine shredding several

Figure 10–24 Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for 
small genomes. the genome is first broken into much smaller, 
overlapping fragments. each fragment is then sequenced, and 
the genome is assembled based on overlapping sequences.

For this reason, a straight-out shotgun approach is the 
strategy of choice only for sequencing small genomes. 
The method proved its worth in 1995, when it was used 
to  sequence  the  genome  of  the  infectious  bacterium 
Haemophilus  influenzae,  the  first  organism  to  have  its 
complete  genome  sequence  determined.  The  trouble 
with  shotgun  sequencing  is  that  the  reassembly  proc-
ess can be derailed by repetitive nucleotide sequences. 
Although  rare  in  bacteria,  these  sequences  make  up  a 
large fraction of vertebrate genomes (see Figure 9–33). 
Highly  repetitive  DNA  segments  make  it  difficult  to 
piece DNA sequences back together accurately (Figure 
10–25). Returning to the ECB analogy, this chapter alone 
contains more than a few instances of the phrase “the 
human genome.” Imagine that one slip of paper from the 
shredded ECBs contains the information: “So why was 
sequencing the human genome” (which appears at the 
start of this section); another contains the information: 
“the  human  genome  sequence  consortium  combined 
shotgun  sequencing  with  a  clone-by-clone  approach” 
(which  appears  below).  You  might  be  tempted  to  join 
these two segments together based on the overlapping 
phrase  “the  human  genome.”  But  you  would  wind  up 
with the nonsensical statement: “So why was sequenc-
ing the human genome sequence consortium combined 
shotgun  sequencing  with  a  clone-by-clone  approach.” 
You  would  also  lose  the  several  paragraphs  of  impor-
tant  text  that  originally  appeared  between  these  two 
instances of “the human genome.”

And  that’s  just  in  this  section.  The  phrase  “the  human 
genome” appears in many chapters of this book. Such 
repetition  compounds  the  problem  of  placing  each 
fragment  in  its  correct  context.  To  circumvent  these 
assembly problems, researchers in the human genome 
sequence  consortium  combined  shotgun  sequencing 
with a clone-by-clone approach.

clone-by-clone

In  this  approach,  researchers  started  by  preparing  a 
genomic  DNA  library.  They  broke  the  human  genome 
into  overlapping  fragments,  100–200  kilobase  pairs  in 
size.  They  then  plugged  these  segments  into  bacterial 
artificial  chromosomes  (BACs)  and  inserted  them  into 
E. coli. (BACs are similar to the bacterial plasmids dis-
cussed earlier, except they can carry much larger pieces 
of DNA.) As the bacteria divided, they copied the BACs,

Figure 10–25 Repetitive DNA sequences in a genome make it 
difficult to accurately assemble its fragments. In this example, 
the DNa contains two segments of repetitive DNa, each made 
of many copies of the sequence Gattaca. When the resulting 
sequences are examined, two fragments from different parts 
of the DNa appear to overlap. assembling these sequences 
incorrectly would result in a loss of the information (in brackets) 
that lies between the original repeats.

thus producing a collection of overlapping cloned frag-
ments (see Figure 10–10).

ECB4 e10.26/10.24

The  researchers  then  determined  where  each  of  these 
DNA  fragments  fit  into  the  existing  map  of  the  human 
genome. To do this, different restriction nucleases were 
used to cut each clone to generate a unique restriction-
site “signature.” The locations of the restriction sites in 
each  fragment  allowed  researchers  to  map  each  BAC 
clone onto a restriction map of a whole human genome 
that had been generated previously using the same set of 
restriction nucleases (Figure 10–26).

Knowing  the  relative  positions  of  the  cloned  frag-
ments, the researchers then selected some 30,000 BACs, 
sheared each into smaller fragments, and determined the 

exploring and exploiting Gene Function          

345

nucleotide  sequence  of  each  BAC  separately  using  the 
shotgun method. They could then assemble the whole 
genome  sequence  by  stitching  together  the  sequences 
of thousands of individual BACs that span the length of 
the genome.

The  beauty  of  this  approach  was  that  it  was  relatively 
easy to accurately determine where the BAC fragments 
belong  in  the  genome.  This  mapping  step  reduces  the 
likelihood that regions containing repetitive sequences 
will be assembled incorrectly, and it virtually eliminates 
the  possibility  that  sequences  from  different  chromo-
somes will be mistakenly joined together. Returning to 
the textbook analogy, the BAC-based approach is akin to 
first separating your copies of ECB into individual pages 
and then shredding each page into its own separate pile. 
It should be much easier to put the book back together 
when one pile of fragments contains words from page 1, 
a second pile from page 2, and so on. And there’s virtu-
ally  no  chance  of  mistakenly  sticking  a  sentence  from 
page 40 into the middle of a paragraph on page 412.

all together now
The  clone-by-clone  approach  produced  the  first  draft 
of the human genome sequence in 2000 and the com-
pleted sequence in 2004. As the set of instructions that 
specify all of the RNA and protein molecules needed to 
build a human being, this string of genetic bits holds the 
secrets to human development and physiology. But the 
sequence was also of great value to researchers inter-
ested in comparative genomics or in the physiology of 
other  organisms:  it  eased  the  assembly  of  nucleotide 
sequences from other mammalian genomes—mice, rats, 
dogs, and other primates. It also made it much easier to 
determine the nucleotide sequences of the genomes of 
individual humans by providing a framework on which 
the new sequences could be simply superimposed. 

The  first  human  sequence  was  the  only  mammalian 
genome  completed  in  this  methodical  way.  But  the 
human  genome  project  was  an  unqualified  success  in 
that it provided the techniques, confidence, and momen-
tum that drove the development of the next generation 
of  DNA  sequencing  methods,  which  are  now  rapidly 
transforming all areas of biology.

of restriction sites allows investigators to order

previously generated using the same nucleases.

its  identity—information  that  is  then  used  to  compile  the  sequence  of 
the DNA molecule. Such methods require no amplification or chemical  
labeling, and thereby reduce the cost and time of sequencing even fur-
ther, making it possible to obtain a complete human genome sequence 
for under $1000 in hours.

comparative genome analyses can identify genes and 
predict their function 
Strings  of  nucleotides,  at  first  glance,  reveal  nothing  about  how  that 
genetic  information  directs  the  development  of  a  living  organism—or 
even what type of organism it might encode. One way to learn something 
about the function of a particular nucleotide sequence is to compare it 
with the multitude of sequences available in public databases. Using a 
computer program to search for sequence similarity, one can determine 
whether a nucleotide sequence contains a gene and what that gene is 
likely to do—based on the gene’s known activity in other organisms. 

Comparative  analyses  have  revealed  that  the  coding  regions  of  genes 
from a wide variety of organisms show a large degree of sequence conser-
vation (see Figure 9–19). The sequences of noncoding regions, however, 
tend to diverge over evolutionary time (see Figure 9–18). Thus, a search 
for sequence similarity can often indicate from which organism a particu-
lar piece of DNA was derived, and which species are most closely related. 
Such information is particularly useful when the origin of a DNA sample 
is  unknown—because  it  was  extracted,  for  example,  from  a  sample  of 
soil or seawater or the blood of a patient with an undiagnosed infection.   

But knowing where a nucleotide sequence comes from—or even what 
activity it might have—is only the first step toward determining what role 
it  has  in  the  development  or  physiology  of  the  organism.  The  knowl-
edge that a particular DNA sequence encodes a transcription regulator, 
for example, does not reveal when and where that protein is produced, 
or which genes it might regulate. To learn that, investigators must head 
back to the laboratory. 

analysis of mrnas by microarray or rna-seq provides a 
snapshot of gene expression 
As we discussed in Chapter 8, a cell expresses only a subset of the thou-
sands of genes available in its genome. This subset differs from one cell 
type to another. One way to determine which genes are being expressed 
in a population of cells or in a tissue is to analyze which mRNAs are being 
produced.

The  first  tool  that  allowed  investigators  to  analyze  simultaneously  the 
thousands of different RNAs produced by cells or tissues was the DNA 
microarray. Developed in the 1990s, DNA microarrays are glass micro-
scope slides that contain hundreds of thousands of DNA fragments, each 
of which serves as a probe for the mRNA produced by a specific gene. Such 
microarrays allow investigators to monitor the expression of every gene 
in an entire genome in a single experiment. To do the analysis, mRNAs 
are extracted from cells or tissues and converted to cDNAs (see Figure 
10–12). The cDNAs are fluorescently labeled and allowed to hybridize to 
the fragments on the microarray. An automated fluorescence microscope 
then determines which mRNAs were present in the original sample based 
on the array positions to which the cDNAs are bound (Figure 10–27). 

Although  microarrays  are  relatively  inexpensive  and  easy  to  use,  they 
suffer from one obvious drawback: the sequences of the mRNA samples 
to be analyzed must be known in advance and represented by a corre-
sponding probe on the array. With the development of next-generation 

exploring and exploiting Gene Function          

347

sequencing  technologies,  investigators  increasingly  use  a  more  direct 
approach for cataloging the RNAs produced by a cell. The RNAs are con-
verted  to  cDNAs,  which  are  then  sequenced  using  second-generation 
sequencing  methods.  The  approach,  called  RNA-Seq,  provides  a  more 
quantitative  analysis  of  the  transcriptome—the  complete  collection  of 
RNAs produced by a cell under a certain set of conditions. It also deter-
mines  the  number  of  times  a  particular  sequence  appears  in  a  sample 
and detects rare mRNAs, RNA transcripts that are alternatively spliced, 
mRNAs that harbor sequence variations, and noncoding RNAs. For these 
reasons, RNA-Seq is replacing microarrays as the method of choice for 
analyzing the transcriptome. 

In Situ Hybridization can reveal When and Where a gene 
is expressed 
Although microarrays and RNA-Seq provide a list of genes that are being 
expressed by a cell or tissue, they do not reveal exactly where in the cell 
or tissue those mRNAs are produced. To see where a particular RNA is 
made, investigators use a technique called in situ hybridization (from the 
Latin in situ, “in place”), which allows a specific nucleic acid sequence—
either DNA or RNA—to be visualized in its normal location. 

In  situ  hybridization  uses  single-stranded  DNA  or  RNA  probes,  labeled 
with  either  fluorescent  dyes  or  radioactive  isotopes,  to  detect  comple-
mentary nucleic acid sequences within a tissue, a cell (Figure 10–28), or 
even  an  isolated  chromosome  (Figure  10–29).  The  latter  application  is 
used in the clinic to determine, for example, whether fetuses carry abnor-
mal chromosomes.

In situ hybridization is frequently used to study the expression patterns 
of a particular gene or collection of genes in an adult or developing tis-
sue. In one particularly ambitious project, neuroscientists are using the 
method to assemble a three-dimensional map of all the genes expressed 
in both the mouse and human brain (Figure 10–30). Knowing where and 
when a gene is expressed can provide important clues about its function.

reporter genes allow specific proteins to be tracked in 
living cells
For a gene that encodes a protein, the location of the protein within the 
cell, tissue, or organism yields clues to the gene’s function. Traditionally, 
the  most  effective  way  to  visualize  a  protein  within  a  cell  or  tissue 
involved using a labeled antibody. That approach requires the generation 
of an antibody that specifically recognizes the protein of interest—a proc-
ess that can be time-consuming and has no guarantee of success. 

An  alternative  approach  is  to  use  the  regulatory  DNA  sequences 
of  the  protein-coding  gene  to  drive  the  expression  of  some  type  of  

Figure 10–29 In situ hybridization can be used to locate genes on 
isolated chromosomes. here, six different DNa probes have been 
used to mark the locations of their respective nucleotide sequences 
on human chromosome 5 isolated from a mitotic cell in metaphase 
(see Figure 5–16 and panel 18–1, pp. 622–623). the DNa probes have 
been labeled with different chemical groups and are detected using 
fluorescent antibodies specific for those groups. Both the maternal 
and paternal copies of chromosome 5 are shown, aligned side by 
side. each probe produces two dots on each chromosome because 
chromosomes undergoing mitosis have already replicated their DNa; 
therefore, each chromosome contains two identical DNa helices. the 
technique employed here is nicknamed FISh, for fluorescence in situ 
hybridization. (courtesy of David c. Ward.)

reporter gene, one that encodes a protein that can be easily monitored 
by  its  fluorescence  or  enzymatic  activity.  A  recombinant  gene  of  this 
type usually mimics the expression of the gene of interest, producing the 
reporter protein when, where, and in the same amounts as the normal 
protein would be made (Figure 10–31A). The same approach can be used 
to study the regulatory DNA sequences that control the gene’s expression 
(Figure 10–31B). 

One of the most popular reporter proteins used today is green fluorescent 
protein (GFP), the molecule that gives luminescent jellyfish their green-
ish glow. In many cases, the gene that encodes GFP is simply attached 
to one end of the gene of interest. The resulting GFP fusion protein often 
behaves in the same way as the normal protein produced by the gene of 
interest, and its location can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy 
(Figure 10–32). GFP fusion has become a standard strategy for tracking 
not only the location but also the movement of specific proteins in living 
cells. In addition, the use of multiple GFP variants that fluoresce at differ-
ent wavelengths can provide insights into how different cells interact in 
a living tissue (Figure 10–33).

the study of mutants can Help reveal the function of a 
gene
Although it may seem counterintuitive, one of the best ways to determine 
a gene’s function is to see what happens to an organism when the gene is 
inactivated by a mutation. Before the advent of gene cloning, geneticists

to determine the pattern of a gene’s 
expression. (a) Suppose the goal is to find 
out which cell types (a–F) express protein 
X, but it is difficult to detect the protein 
directly—with antibodies, for example. 
Using recombinant DNa techniques, 
the coding sequence for protein X can 
be replaced with the coding sequence 
for reporter protein Y, which can be 
easily monitored visually; two commonly 
used reporter proteins are the enzyme 
β-galactosidase (see Figure 8–13c) and 
green fluorescent protein (GFp, see Figure 
10–32). the expression of the reporter 
protein Y will now be controlled by the 
regulatory sequences (here labeled 1, 2, and 
3) that control the expression of the normal 
protein X. (B) to determine which regulatory 
sequences normally control expression of 
gene X in particular cell types, reporters 
with various combinations of the regulatory 
regions associated with gene X can be 
constructed. these recombinant DNa 
molecules are then tested for expression 
after their introduction into the different cell 
types.

Figure 10–32 Green fluorescent protein (GFp) can be used to 
identify specific cells in a living animal. For this experiment, carried 
out in the fruit fly, recombinant DNa techniques were used to join the 
gene encoding GFp to the regulatory DNa sequences that direct the 
production of a particular Drosophila protein. Both the GFp and the 
normal fly protein are made only in a specialized set of neurons. this 
image of a live fly embryo was captured by a fluorescence microscope 
and shows approximately 20 neurons, each with long projections 
(axons and dendrites) that communicate with other (nonfluorescent) 
cells. these neurons, located just under the embryo’s surface, allow 
the organism to sense its immediate environment. (From W.B. Grueber 
et al., Curr. Biol. 13:618–626, 2003. With permission from elsevier.)

studied the mutant organisms that arise spontaneously in a population. 
The  mutants  of  most  interest  were  often  selected  because  of  their  un-
usual phenotype—fruit flies with white eyes or curly wings, for example. 
The gene responsible for the mutant phenotype could then be studied by 
breeding experiments, as Gregor Mendel did with peas in the nineteenth 
century (discussed in Chapter 19). 

Although mutant organisms can arise spontaneously, they do so infre-
quently.  The  process  can  be  accelerated  by  treating  organisms  with 
either  radiation  or  chemical  mutagens,  which  randomly  disrupt  gene 
activity. Such random mutagenesis generates large numbers of mutant 
organisms, each of which can then be studied individually. This “classi-
cal genetic approach,” which we discuss in detail in Chapter 19, is most 
applicable  to  organisms  that  reproduce  rapidly  and  can  be  analyzed 
genetically in the laboratory—such as bacteria, yeasts, nematode worms, 
and fruit flies—although it has also been used in zebrafish and mice.  

rna interference (rnai) inhibits the activity of specific 
genes
Recombinant  DNA  technology  has  made  possible  a  more  targeted 
genetic approach to studying gene function. Instead of beginning with a 
randomly generated mutant and then identifying the responsible gene, a 
gene of known sequence can be inactivated deliberately and the effects 
on the cell or organism’s phenotype can be observed. Because this strat-
egy  is  essentially  the  reverse  of  that  used  in  classical  genetics—which 
goes from mutants to genes—it is often referred to as reverse genetics.

One of the fastest and easiest ways to silence genes in cells and organ-
isms is via RNA interference (RNAi). Discovered in 1998, RNAi exploits 
a  natural  mechanism  used  in  a  wide  variety  of  plants  and  animals  to 
protect themselves against certain viruses and the proliferation of mobile 
genetic elements (discussed in Chapter 9). The technique involves intro-
ducing  into  a  cell  or  organism  double-stranded  RNA  molecules  with  a 
nucleotide sequence that matches the gene to be inactivated. The dou-
ble-stranded RNA is cleaved and processed by special RNAi machinery 
to  produce  shorter,  double-stranded  fragments  called  small  interfering 
RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are unwound to form single-stranded RNA 
fragments that hybridize with the target gene’s mRNAs and direct their 
degradation (see Figure 8–26). In some organisms, the same fragments 
can direct the production of more siRNAs allowing continued inactiva-
tion of the target mRNAs.

ECB4 e10.38/10.35

RNAi is frequently used to inactivate genes in cultured mammalian cell 
lines,  Drosophila,  and  the  nematode  C.  elegans.  Introducing  double-
stranded RNAs into C. elegans is particularly easy: the worm can be fed 
with E. coli that have been genetically engineered to produce the dou-
ble-stranded  RNAs  that  trigger  RNAi  (Figure  10–34).  These  RNAs  get 
converted  into  siRNAs,  which  get  distributed  throughout  the  animal’s 
body to inhibit expression of the target gene in various tissues. For the 
many organisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced, RNAi 
can, in principle, be used to explore the function of any gene, and large 
collections of DNA vectors that produce these double-stranded RNAs are 
available for several species. 

a Known gene can be deleted or replaced With an 
altered Version
Despite its usefulness, RNAi has some limitations. Non-target genes are 
sometimes inhibited along with the gene of interest, and certain cell types 
are resistant to RNAi entirely. Even for cell types in which the mechanism 
functions effectively, gene inactivation by RNAi is often temporary, earn-
ing the description “gene knockdown.” 

Fortunately, there are other, more specific and effective means of elimi-
nating  gene  activity  in  cells  and  organisms.  Using  recombinant  DNA 
techniques, the coding sequence of a cloned gene can be mutated in vitro 
to change the functional properties of its protein product. Alternatively, 
the coding region can be left intact and the regulatory region of the gene 
changed, so that the amount of protein made will be altered or the gene 
will be expressed in a different type of cell or at a different time during 
development.  By  re-introducing  this  altered  gene  back  into  the  organ-
ism from which it originally came, one can produce a mutant organism 

exploring and exploiting Gene Function

that can be studied to determine the gene’s function. Often the altered 
gene is inserted into the genome of reproductive cells so that it can be 
stably inherited by subsequent generations. Organisms whose genomes 
have been altered in this way are known as transgenic organisms, or 
genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs);  the  introduced  gene  is  called  a 
transgene.
To study the function of a gene that has been altered in vitro, ideally one 
would like to generate an organism in which the normal gene has been 
replaced by the altered one. In this way, the function of the mutant protein 
can be analyzed in the absence of the normal protein. A common way 
of doing this in mice makes use of cultured mouse embryonic stem (ES) 
cells (discussed in Chapter 20). These cells are first subjected to targeted 
gene replacement before being transplanted into a developing embryo to 
produce a mutant mouse, as illustrated in Figure 10–35.

in mice utilizes embryonic stem (ES) cells. 
(a) First, an altered version of the gene is 
introduced into cultured eS cells. In a few 
rare eS cells, the altered gene will replace 
the corresponding normal gene through 
homologous recombination. although the 
procedure is often laborious, these rare cells 
can be identified and cultured to produce 
many descendants, each of which carries 
an altered gene in place of one of its two 
normal corresponding genes. (B) Next, the 
altered eS cells are injected into a very early 
mouse embryo; the cells are incorporated 
into the growing embryo, which then 
develops into a mouse that contains some 
somatic cells (colored orange) that carry the 
altered gene. Some of these mice may also 
have germ-line cells that contain the altered 
gene; when bred with a normal mouse, 
some of the progeny of these mice will 
contain the altered gene in all of their cells. 
Such a mouse is called a “knock-in” mouse. 
If two such mice are bred, one can obtain 
progeny that contain two copies of the 
altered gene—one on each chromosome—
in all of their cells.

Figure 10–36 Transgenic mice with a 
mutant DNA helicase show premature 
aging. the helicase, encoded by the Xpd 
gene, is involved in both transcription 
and DNa repair. compared with a wild-
type mouse (a), a transgenic mouse that 
expresses a defective version of Xpd 
(B) exhibits many of the symptoms of 
premature aging, including osteoporosis, 
emaciation, early graying, infertility, and 
reduced life-span. the mutation in Xpd 
used here impairs the activity of the 
helicase and mimics a human mutation 
that causes trichothiodystrophy, a disorder 
characterized by brittle hair, skeletal 
abnormalities, and a greatly reduced life 
expectancy. these results support the 
hypothesis that an accumulation of DNa 
damage contributes to the aging process 
in both humans and mice. (From J. de Boer

Using  a  similar  strategy,  the  activity  of  both  copies  of  a  gene  can  also 
be eliminated entirely, creating a “gene knockout.” To do this, one can 
either introduce an inactive, mutant version of the gene into cultured ES 
cells or delete the gene altogether. The ability to use ES cells to produce 
such “knockout mice” revolutionized the study of gene function, and the 
technique is now being used to systematically determine the function of 
every mouse gene (Figure 10–36). A variation of this technique is used 
to  produce  conditional  knockout  mice,  in  which  a  known  gene  can  be 
disrupted more selectively—only in a particular cell type or at a certain 
time in development. Such conditional knockouts are useful for studying 
genes with a critical function during development, because mice missing 
these crucial genes often die before birth.

mutant organisms provide useful models of Human 
disease 
Technically speaking, transgenic approaches could be used to alter genes 
in  the  human  germ  line.  For  ethical  reasons,  such  manipulations  are 
unlawful. But transgenic technologies are widely used to generate ani-
mal models of human diseases in which mutant genes play a major part. 

With  the  explosion  of  DNA  sequencing  technologies,  investigators  can 
rapidly search the genomes of patients for mutations that cause or greatly 
increase the risk of their disease (discussed in Chapter 19). These muta-
tions  can  then  be  introduced  into  animals,  such  as  mice,  that  can  be 
studied in the laboratory. The resulting transgenic animals, which often 
mimic some of the phenotypic abnormalities associated with the condi-
tion in patients, can be used to explore the cellular and molecular basis of 
the disease and to screen for drugs that could potentially be used thera-
peutically in humans. 

An encouraging example is provided by fragile X syndrome, a neuropsy-
chiatric  disorder  associated  with  intellectual  impairment,  neurological 
abnormalities,  and  often  autism.  The  disease  is  caused  by  a  mutation 
in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1), which encodes a protein 
that  inhibits  the  translation  of  mRNAs  into  proteins  at  synapses—the 
junctions where nerve cells communicate with one another (see Figure 
12–38). Transgenic mice in which the FMR1 gene has been disabled show 
many  of  the  same  neurological  and  behavioral  abnormalities  seen  in 
patients with the disorder, and drugs that return synaptic protein synthe-
sis to near-normal levels also reverse many of the problems seen in these 
mutant mice. Preliminary studies suggest that at least one of these drugs 
may benefit patients with the disease. 

transgenic plants are important for both cell biology and 
agriculture
Although we tend to think of recombinant DNA research in terms of ani-
mal biology, these techniques have also had a profound impact on the 

exploring and exploiting Gene Function          

353

study of plants. In fact, certain features of plants make them especially 
amenable to recombinant DNA methods.

When a piece of plant tissue is cultured in a sterile medium containing 
nutrients and appropriate growth regulators, some of the cells are stimu-
lated  to  proliferate  indefinitely  in  a  disorganized  manner,  producing  a 
mass of relatively undifferentiated cells called a callus. If the nutrients and 
growth regulators are carefully manipulated, one can induce the forma-
tion of a shoot within the callus, and in many species a whole new plant 
can be regenerated from such shoots. In a number of plants—including 
tobacco, petunia, carrot, potato, and Arabidopsis—a single cell from such 
a callus can be grown into a small clump of cells from which a whole 
plant can be regenerated (see Figure 8–2B). Just as mutant mice can be 
derived by the genetic manipulation of embryonic stem cells in culture, 
so transgenic plants can be created from plant cells transfected with DNA 
in culture (Figure 10–37).

The ability to produce transgenic plants has greatly accelerated progress 
in many areas of plant cell biology. It has played an important part, for 
example,  in  isolating  receptors  for  growth  regulators  and  in  analyzing 
the  mechanisms  of  morphogenesis  and  of  gene  expression  in  plants. 
These techniques have also opened up many new possibilities in agri-
culture that could benefit both the farmer and the consumer. They have 
made  it  possible,  for  example,  to  modify  the  ratio  of  lipid,  starch,  and 
protein in seeds, to impart pest and virus resistance to plants, and to cre-
ate modified plants that tolerate extreme habitats such as salt marshes or 
water-stressed soil. One variety of rice has been genetically engineered 
to  produce  β-carotene,  the  precursor  of  vitamin  A.  If  it  replaced  con-
ventional  rice,  this  “golden  rice”—so  called  because  of  its  faint  yellow 
color—could help to alleviate severe vitamin A deficiency, which causes 
blindness in hundreds of thousands of children in the developing world 
each year.

Figure 10–38 Large amounts of a protein can be produced from 
a protein-coding DNA sequence inserted into an expression 
vector and introduced into cells. here, a plasmid vector has 
been engineered to contain a highly active promoter, which causes 
unusually large amounts of mrNa to be produced from the inserted 
protein-coding gene. Depending on the characteristics of the cloning 
vector, the plasmid is introduced into bacterial, yeast, insect, or 
mammalian cells, where the inserted gene is efficiently transcribed and 
translated into protein. 

even rare proteins can be made in large amounts using 
cloned dna
One  of  the  most  important  contributions  of  DNA  cloning  and  genetic 
engineering to cell biology is that they make it possible to produce any 
protein, including the rare ones, in nearly unlimited amounts. Such high-
level  production  is  usually  accomplished  by  using  specially  designed 
vectors known as expression vectors. These vectors include transcription 
and  translation  signals  that  direct  an  inserted  gene  to  be  expressed  at 
very high levels. Different expression vectors are designed for use in bac-
terial, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells, each containing the appropriate 
regulatory  sequences  for  transcription  and  translation  in  these  cells 
(Figure 10–38). The expression vector is replicated at each round of cell 
division, so that the transfected cells in the culture are able to synthesize 
very large amounts of the protein of interest—often comprising 1–10% of 
the total cell protein. It is usually a simple matter to purify this protein 
away from the other proteins made by the host cell. 

This technology is now used to make large amounts of many medically 
useful  proteins,  including  hormones  (such  as  insulin),  growth  factors, 
and viral coat proteins for use in vaccines. Expression vectors also allow 
scientists to produce many proteins of biological interest in large enough 
amounts  for  detailed  structural  and  functional  studies  that  were  once 
impossible—especially  for  proteins  that  are  normally  present  in  very

Recombinant  DNA  techniques  thus  allow  scientists  to  move  with  ease 
from protein to gene, and vice versa, so that the functions of both can be 
explored on multiple fronts (Figure 10–39).

Figure 10–39 Recombinant DNA techniques make it possible to move experimentally from gene to protein and from protein 
to gene. a small quantity of a purified protein or peptide fragment is used to obtain a partial amino acid sequence, which is used to 
search a DNa database for the corresponding nucleotide sequence. this sequence is used to synthesize a DNa probe, which can be 
used either to pick out the corresponding gene from a DNa library by DNa hybridization (see Figure 10–11) or to clone the gene by 
pcr from a sequenced genome (see Figure 10–16). Once the gene has been isolated and sequenced, its protein-coding sequence 
can be inserted into an expression vector to produce large quantities of the protein (see Figure 10–38), which can then be studied 
biochemically or structurally. In addition to producing protein, the gene or DNa can also be manipulated and introduced into cells or 
organisms to study its function. (NMr stands for nuclear magnetic resonance; see how We Know, pp. 162–163.)

essential concepts
•	 Recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized the study of cells, 
making it possible to pick out any gene at will from the thousands of 
genes in a cell and to determine its nucleotide sequence. 

•	 A	crucial	element	in	this	technology	is	the	ability	to	cut	a	large	DNA	
molecule into a specific and reproducible set of DNA fragments using 
restriction nucleases, each of which cuts the DNA double helix only 
at a particular nucleotide sequence.

•	 DNA	fragments	can	be	separated	from	one	another	on	the	basis	of	

size by gel electrophoresis. 

•	 Nucleic	acid	hybridization	can	detect	any	given	DNA	or	RNA	sequence	
in  a  mixture  of  nucleic  acid  fragments.  This  technique  depends  on 
highly  specific  base-pairing  between  a  labeled,  single-stranded 
DNA or RNA probe and another nucleic acid with a complementary 
sequence. 

•	 DNA	 cloning	 techniques	 enable	 any	 DNA	 sequence	 to	 be	 selected	
from millions of other sequences and produced in unlimited amounts 
in pure form.

•	 DNA	fragments	can	be	joined	together	in vitro by using DNA ligase to 

form recombinant DNA molecules that are not found in nature.

•	 DNA	fragments	can	be	maintained	and	amplified	by	inserting	them	
into a larger DNA molecule capable of replication, such as a plasmid. 
This  recombinant  DNA  molecule  is  then  introduced  into  a  rapidly 
dividing host cell, usually a bacterium, so that the DNA is replicated 
at each cell division. 

•	 A	collection	of	cloned	fragments	of	chromosomal	DNA	representing	
the complete genome of an organism is known as a genomic library. 
The  library  is  often  maintained  as  millions  of  clones  of  bacteria, 
each different clone carrying a different fragment of the organism’s 
genome.

•	 cDNA	 libraries	 contain	 cloned	 DNA	 copies	 of	 the	 total	 mRNA	 of	 a	
particular type of cell or tissue. Unlike genomic DNA clones, cDNA 
clones  contain  predominantly  protein-coding  sequences;  they  lack 
introns,  regulatory  DNA  sequences,  and  promoters.  Thus  they  are 
useful when the cloned gene is needed to make a protein.

•	 The	 polymerase	 chain	 reaction	 (PCR)	 is	 a	 powerful	 form	 of	 DNA	
amplification that is carried out in vitro using a purified DNA polymer-
ase. PCR requires prior knowledge of the sequence to be amplified, 
because two synthetic oligonucleotide primers must be synthesized 
that bracket the portion of DNA to be replicated.

•	 Historically,	 genes	 were	 cloned	 using	 hybridization	 techniques	 to	
identify the bacteria carrying the desired sequence in a DNA library. 
Today, a gene is usually cloned using PCR to specifically amplify it 
from a sample of DNA or mRNA. 

•	 DNA	 sequencing	 techniques	 have	 become	 increasingly	 fast	 and	
cheap, so that the entire genomes of thousands of different organ-
isms are now known, including thousands of individual humans.

•		 Using	 recombinant	 DNA	 techniques,	 a	 protein	 can	 be	 joined	 to	 a	
molecular	tag,	such	as	green	fluorescent	protein	(GFP),	which	allows	
its movement to be tracked inside a cell and, in some cases, inside a 
living organism.
In situ nucleic acid hybridization can be used to detect the precise 
location of genes on chromosomes and of RNAs in cells and tissues. 
•	 DNA	microarrays	and	RNA-Seq	can	be	used	to	monitor	the	expres-

•	

sion of tens of thousands of genes at once.

•	 Cloned	 genes	 can	 be	 altered	 in  vitro  and  stably  inserted  into  the 
genome of a cell or an organism to study their function. Such mutants 
are called transgenic organisms.

•	 The	expression	of	particular	genes	can	be	inhibited	in	cells	or	organ-
isms	by	the	technique	of	RNA	interference	(RNAi),	which	prevents	an	
mRNA from being translated into protein.

•	 Bacteria,	yeasts,	and	mammalian	cells	can	be	engineered	to	synthe-
size  large  quantities  of  any  protein  whose  gene  has  been  cloned, 
making it possible to study proteins that are otherwise rare or dif-
ficult to isolate.

Questions

Question 10–5
What are the consequences for a dna sequencing reaction 
if the ratio of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to 
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates is increased? What 
happens if this ratio is decreased?

Question 10–6
almost all the cells in an individual animal contain identical 
genomes. in an experiment, a tissue composed of several 
different cell types is fixed and subjected to in situ 
hybridization with a dna probe to a particular gene. to 
your surprise, the hybridization signal is much stronger in 
some cells than in others. How might you explain this result?

Question 10–7
after decades of work, dr. ricky m. isolated a small amount 
of attractase—an enzyme that produces a powerful human 
pheromone—from hair samples of Hollywood celebrities. 
to take advantage of attractase for his personal use, he 
obtained a complete genomic clone of the attractase 
gene, connected it to a strong bacterial promoter on an 
expression plasmid, and introduced the plasmid into  
E. coli cells. He was devastated to find that no attractase 
was produced in the cells. What is a likely explanation for 
his failure?

Question 10–8

Which of the following statements are correct? explain your 
answers.
a.  restriction nucleases cut dna at specific sites that are 
always located between genes.
b.  dna migrates toward the positive electrode during 
electrophoresis.
c.  clones isolated from cdna libraries contain promoter 
sequences.
d.  pcr utilizes a heat-stable dna polymerase because 
for each amplification step, double-stranded dna must be 
heat-denatured.
e.  digestion of genomic dna with aluI, a restriction 
enzyme that recognizes a four-nucleotide sequence, 
produces fragments that are all exactly 256 nucleotides in 
length.
f.  to make a cdna library, both a dna polymerase and a 
reverse transcriptase must be used.
g.  dna fingerprinting by pcr relies on the fact that 
different individuals have different numbers of repeats in 
str regions in their genome.
H.  it is possible for a coding region of a gene to be present 

in a genomic library prepared from a particular tissue but 
to be absent from a cdna library prepared from the same 
tissue.

Question 10–9
a.  What is the sequence of the dna 
that was used in the sequencing 
reaction shown in Figure Q10–9? 
the four lanes show the products of 
sequencing reactions that contained 
ddg (lane 1), dda (lane 2), ddt (lane 
3), and ddc (lane 4). the numbers 
to the right of the autoradiograph 
represent the positions of marker 
dna fragments of 50 and 116 
nucleotides.
b.  this dna was derived from 
the middle of a cdna clone of a 
mammalian protein. using the genetic 
code table (see figure 7–25), can you 
determine the amino acid sequence 
of this portion of the protein?

Question 10–10
a.  How many different dna 
fragments would you expect to obtain 
if you cleaved human genomic dna 
with Haeiii? (recall that there are  
3 × 109 nucleotide pairs per haploid 
genome.) How many fragments would 
you expect with ecori?
b.  Human genomic libraries used for dna sequencing are 
often made from fragments obtained by cleaving human 
dna with Haeiii in such a way that the dna is only partially 
digested; that is, not all the possible Haeiii sites have been 
cleaved. What is a possible reason for doing this?

dna markers is given in kilobase pairs (kb), where 1 kb = 
1000 nucleotide pairs. using the size markers as a guide, 
estimate the length of each restriction fragment obtained. 
from this information, construct a map of the original 
dna molecule indicating the relative positions of all the 
restriction enzyme cleavage sites.

Question 10–12

you have isolated a small amount of a rare protein. you 
cleaved the protein into fragments using proteases, 
separated some of the fragments by chromatography, and 
determined their amino acid sequence. unfortunately, as 
is often the case when only small amounts of protein are 
available, you obtained only three short stretches of amino 
acid sequence from the protein: 

1. trp-met-His-His-lys

2. leu-ser-arg-leu-arg

3. tyr-phe-gly-met-gln

a.  using the genetic code (see figure 7–25), design 
a collection of dna probes specific for each peptide 
that could be used to detect the gene in a cdna library 
by hybridization. Which of the three collections of 
oligonucleotide probes would it be preferable to use first? 
explain your answer. (Hint: the genetic code is redundant, 
so each peptide has multiple potential coding sequences.)

b.  you have also been able to determine that the gln of 
your peptide #3 is the c-terminal (i.e., the final) amino 
acid of your protein. How would you go about designing 
oligonucleotide primers that could be used to amplify a 
portion of the gene from a cdna library using pcr? 

c.  suppose the pcr amplification in (b) yields a dna that 
is precisely 300 nucleotides long. upon determining the 
nucleotide sequence of this dna, you find the sequence 
ctatcacgccttagg approximately in its middle. What 
would you conclude from these observations? 

Question 10–13
assume that a dna sequencing reaction is carried out 
as shown in figure 10–20, except that the four different 
dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are modified so that 
each contains a covalently attached dye of a different 
color (which does not interfere with its incorporation 
into the dna chain). What would the products be 
if you added a mixture of all four of these labeled 
dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates along with the four 
unlabeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates into a single 
sequencing reaction? What would the results look like if you 
electrophoresed these products in a single lane of a gel? 

Question 10–14
genomic dna clones are often used to “walk” along a 
chromosome. in this approach, one cloned dna is used 
to isolate other clones that contain overlapping dna 
sequences (Figure Q10–14). using this method, it is 
possible to build up a long stretch of dna and thus identify 
new genes in near proximity to a previously cloned gene. 
a.  Would it be faster to use cdna clones in this method, 
because they do not contain any intron sequences?

there has been a colossal snafu in the maternity ward 
of your local hospital. four sets of male twins, born 
within an hour of each other, were inadvertently shuffled 
in the excitement occasioned by that unlikely event. 
you have been called in to set things straight. as a first 
step, you would like to match each baby with his twin. 
(many newborns look alike so you don’t want to rely on 
appearance alone.) to that end you analyze a small blood 
sample from each infant using a hybridization probe that 
detects short tandem repeats (strs) located in widely 
scattered regions of the genome. the results are shown in 
Figure Q10–15.
a.  Which infants are twins? Which are identical twins?
b.  How could you match a pair of twins to the correct 
parents?

Question 10–16
ECB4 eQ10.17/Q10.16
one of the first organisms that was genetically modified 
using recombinant dna technology was a bacterium 
that normally lives on the surface of strawberry plants. 
this bacterium makes a protein, called ice-protein, that 
causes the efficient formation of ice crystals around it 
when the temperature drops to just below freezing. thus, 
strawberries harboring this bacterium are particularly 
susceptible to frost damage because their cells are 
destroyed by the ice crystals. consequently, strawberry 
farmers have a considerable interest in preventing ice 
crystallization.
  a genetically engineered version of this bacterium was 
constructed in which the ice-protein gene was knocked 
out. the mutant bacteria were then introduced in large 
numbers into strawberry fields, where they displaced the 
normal bacteria by competition for their ecological niche. 
this approach has been successful: strawberries bearing the 
mutant bacteria show a much reduced susceptibility to frost 
damage. 
  at the time they were first carried out, the initial 
open-field trials triggered an intense debate because 
they represented the first release into the environment of 
an organism that had been genetically engineered using 
recombinant dna technology. indeed, all preliminary 
experiments were carried out with extreme caution and in 
strict containment (Figure Q10–16).
  do you think that bacteria lacking the ice-protein could 
be isolated without the use of modern dna technology? 
is it likely that such mutations have already occurred in 
nature? Would the use of a mutant bacterial strain isolated 
from nature be of lesser concern? should we be concerned 
about the risks posed by the application of recombinant 
dna techniques in agriculture and medicine? explain your 
answers.

Membrane Structure

A living cell is a self-reproducing system of molecules held inside a con-
tainer. That container is the plasma membrane—a protein-studded, fatty 
film so thin that it cannot be seen directly in the light microscope. Every 
cell on Earth uses such a membrane to separate and protect its chemical 
components from the outside environment. Without membranes, there 
would be no cells, and thus no life.

The structure of the plasma membrane is simple: it consists of a two-ply 
sheet of lipid molecules about 5 nm—or 50 atoms—thick, into which pro-
teins have been inserted. Its properties, however, are unlike those of any 
sheet of material we are familiar with in the everyday world. Although it 
serves as a barrier to prevent the contents of the cell from escaping and 
mixing  with  the  surrounding  medium  (Figure  11–1),  the  plasma  mem-
brane does much more than that. If a cell is to survive and grow, nutrients 
must  pass  inward  across  the  plasma  membrane,  and  waste  products 
must pass out. To facilitate this exchange, the membrane is penetrated by 
highly selective channels and transporters—proteins that allow specific,

Chapter 11     Membrane Structure

Figure 11–2 the plasma membrane is 
involved in cell communication, import 
and export of molecules, and cell growth 
and motility. (1) receptor proteins in the 
plasma membrane enable the cell to receive 
signals from the environment; (2) transport 
proteins in the membrane enable the import 
and export of small molecules; (3) the 
flexibility of the membrane and its capacity 
for expansion allow the cell to grow, change 
shape, and move.

small molecules and ions to be imported and exported. Other proteins in 
the membrane act as sensors, or receptors, that enable the cell to receive 
information  about  changes  in  its  environment  and  respond  to  them  in 
appropriate ways. The mechanical properties of the plasma membrane 
are equally remarkable. When a cell grows or changes shape, so does its 
membrane: it enlarges in area by adding new membrane without ever 
losing its continuity, and it can deform without tearing (Figure 11–2). If 
the membrane is pierced, it neither collapses like a balloon nor remains 
torn; instead, it quickly reseals.
As shown in Figure 11–1, the simplest bacteria have only a single mem-
brane—the  plasma  membrane—whereas  eukaryotic  cells  also  contain 
internal membranes that enclose intracellular compartments. The inter-
nal  membranes  form  various  organelles,  including  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum,  Golgi  apparatus,  and  mitochondria  (Figure  11–3).  Although 
these  internal  membranes  are  constructed  on  the  same  principles  as 
the plasma membrane, there are subtle differences in their composition, 
especially in their resident proteins.

Regardless of their location, all cell membranes are composed of lipids 
and proteins and share a common general structure (Figure 11–4). The 
lipids are arranged in two closely apposed sheets, forming a lipid bilayer 
(see Figure 11–4B and C). This lipid bilayer serves as a permeability bar-
rier  to  most  water-soluble  molecules.  The  proteins  carry  out  the  other 
functions of the membrane and give different membranes their individual 
characteristics. 

In this chapter, we consider the structure of biological membranes and 
the  organization  of  their  two  main  constituents:  lipids  and  proteins. 
Although we focus mainly on the plasma membrane, most of the con-
cepts we discuss also apply to internal membranes. The functions of cell 
membranes, including their role in cell communication, the transport of 
small molecules, and energy generation, are considered in later chapters.

THE LIPID BILAYER
Because cells are filled with—and surrounded by—water, the structure of 
cell membranes is determined by the way membrane lipids behave in a 
watery (aqueous) environment. In this section, we take a closer look at 
the lipid bilayer, which constitutes the fundamental structure of all cell 
membranes.  We  consider  how  lipid  bilayers  form,  how  they  are  main-
tained,  and  how  their  properties  establish  the  general  properties  of  all 
cell membranes.

membrane Lipids Form Bilayers in Water
The lipids in cell membranes combine two very different properties in a 
single molecule: each lipid has a hydrophilic (“water-loving”) head and 
a  hydrophobic  (“water-fearing”)  tail.  The  most  abundant  lipids  in  cell 
membranes  are  the  phospholipids,  which  have  a  phosphate-contain-
ing, hydrophilic head linked to a pair of hydrophobic tails (Figure 11–5). 
Phosphatidylcholine,  for  example,  has  the  small  molecule  choline 
attached to a phosphate group as its hydrophilic head (Figure 11–6). 

ECB4 e11.04/11.04

Molecules  with  both  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic  parts  are  termed 
amphipathic,  a  property  shared  by  other  types  of  membrane  lipids, 
including  the  cholesterol,  which  is  found  in  animal  cell  membranes 
and the glycolipids, which have sugars as part of their hydrophilic head 
(Figure  11–7).  Having  both  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic  parts  plays  a 
crucial part in driving these lipid molecules to assemble into bilayers in 
an aqueous environment. 

As discussed in Chapter 2 (see Panel 2–2, pp. 68–69), hydrophilic molecules 
dissolve readily in water because they contain either charged groups or 
uncharged polar groups that can form either electrostatic attractions or 
hydrogen bonds with water molecules (Figure 11–8). Hydrophobic mol-
ecules, by contrast, are insoluble in water because all—or almost all—of 
their  atoms  are  uncharged  and  nonpolar;  they  therefore  cannot  form 
favorable interactions with water molecules. Instead, they force adjacent 
water  molecules  to  reorganize  into  a  cagelike  structure  around  them 
(Figure  11–9).  Because  this  cagelike  structure  is  more  highly  ordered 
than the rest of the water, its formation requires free energy. This energy 
cost is minimized when the hydrophobic molecules cluster together, lim-
iting their contacts with the surrounding water molecules. Thus purely 
hydrophobic molecules, like the fats found in animal fat cells and the oils 
found in plant seeds (Figure 11–10a), coalesce into a single large drop 
when dispersed in water.
Amphipathic molecules, such as phospholipids (Figure 11–10B), are sub-
ject to two conflicting forces: the hydrophilic head is attracted to water, 
while  the  hydrophobic  tails  shun  water  and  seek  to  aggregate  with 
other hydrophobic molecules. This conflict is beautifully resolved by the

Figure 11–6 phosphatidylcholine is the most common phospholipid in cell membranes. It is represented 
schematically in (a), as a chemical formula in (B), as a space-filling model in (c), and as a symbol in (D). this particular 
phospholipid is built from five parts: the hydrophilic head, which consists of choline linked to a phosphate group; 
two hydrocarbon chains, which form the hydrophobic tails; and a molecule of glycerol, which links the head to the 
tails. each of the hydrophobic tails is a fatty acid—a hydrocarbon chain with a –cOOh group at one end—which 
has been attached to glycerol via this group. a kink in one of the hydrocarbon chains occurs where there is a double 
bond between two carbon atoms. (the “phosphatidyl” part of the name of a phospholipid refers to the phosphate–
glycerol–fatty acid portion of the molecule.)

formation of a lipid bilayer—an arrangement that satisfies all parties and 
is energetically most favorable. The hydrophilic heads face water on both 
surfaces of the bilayer; but the hydrophobic tails are all shielded from the 
water, as they lie next to one another in the interior, like the filling in a 
sandwich (Figure 11–11).

ECB4  e11.08/11.08

The same forces that drive the amphipathic molecules to form a bilayer 
help to make the bilayer self-sealing. Any tear in the sheet will create a 
free edge that is exposed to water. Because this situation is energetically 
unfavorable, the molecules of the bilayer will spontaneously rearrange 
to  eliminate  the  free  edge.  If  the  tear  is  small,  this  spontaneous  re-
arrangement will exclude the water molecules and lead to repair of the 
bilayer, restoring a single continuous sheet. If the tear is large, the sheet 
may  begin  to  fold  in  on  itself  and  break  up  into  separate  closed  vesi-
cles. In either case, the overriding principle is that free edges are quickly 
eliminated.

The prohibition on free edges has a profound consequence: the only way 
a finite amphipathic sheet can avoid having free edges is to bend and seal,

Water molecules are said “to 
reorganize into a cagelike structure” 
around hydrophobic compounds 
(e.g., see Figure 11–9). This 
seems paradoxical because water 
molecules do not interact with 
the hydrophobic compound. so 
how could they “know” about its 
presence and change their behavior 
to interact differently with one 
another? Discuss this argument 
and, in doing so, develop a clear 
concept of what is meant by a 
“cagelike” structure. How does it 
compare to ice? Why would this 
cagelike structure be energetically 
unfavorable?

hydrophobic, it cannot form favorable

a cagelike structure around it, in order to 
maximize their hydrogen bonds with each

Figure 11–10 Fat molecules are hydrophobic, unlike phospholipids. 
triacylglycerols, which are the main constituents of animal fats and 
plant oils, are entirely hydrophobic. here, the third hydrophobic 
tail of the triacylglycerol molecule in (a) is drawn facing upward 
for comparison with the phospholipid (see Figure 11–6), although 
normally it is depicted facing down (see panel 2–4, pp. 72–73).

forming  a  boundary  around  a  closed  space  (Figure  11–12).  Therefore, 
amphipathic molecules such as phospholipids necessarily assemble into 
self-sealing  containers  that  define  closed  compartments.  This  remark-
able  behavior,  fundamental  to  the  creation  of  a  living  cell,  is  simply  a 
result of the property that each molecule is hydrophilic at one end and 
hydrophobic at the other.

The Lipid Bilayer Is a Flexible Two-dimensional Fluid
The aqueous environment inside and outside a cell prevents membrane 
lipids from escaping from the bilayer, but nothing stops these molecules 
from  moving  about  and  changing  places  with  one  another  within  the 
plane of the bilayer. The membrane therefore behaves as a two-dimen-
sional  fluid,  a  fact  that  is  crucial  for  membrane  function  and  integrity 
(Movie 11.1). 

The lipid bilayer is also flexible—that is, it is able to bend. Like fluidity, 
flexibility is important for membrane function, and it sets a lower limit of 
about 25 nm to the size of vesicle that cell membranes can form.

The fluidity of lipid bilayers can be studied using synthetic lipid bilayers, 
which  are  easily  produced  by  the  spontaneous  aggregation  of  amphi-
pathic  lipid  molecules  in  water.  Pure  phospholipids,  for  example,  will 
form closed spherical vesicles, called liposomes, when added to water; 
they vary in size from about 25 nm to 1 mm in diameter (Figure 11–13).

Such  simple  synthetic  bilayers  allow  the  movements  of  the  lipid  mol-
ecules to be measured. These measurements reveal that some types of 
movement are rare, while others are frequent and rapid. Thus, in syn-
thetic lipid bilayers, phospholipid molecules very rarely tumble from one 
half of the bilayer, or monolayer, to the other. Without proteins to facili-
tate the process, it is estimated that this event, called “flip-flop,” occurs 
less than once a month for any individual lipid molecule under conditions

similar to those in a cell. On the other hand, as the result of random ther-
mal  motions,  lipid  molecules  continuously  exchange  places  with  their 
neighbors in the same monolayer. This exchange leads to rapid lateral 
diffusion of lipid molecules within the plane of each monolayer, so that, 
for example, a lipid in an artificial bilayer may diffuse a length equal to 
that of an entire bacterial cell (~2 μm) in about one second.
Similar  studies  show  that  individual  lipid  molecules  not  only  flex  their 
hydrocarbon  tails,  but  they  also  rotate  rapidly  about  their  long  axis—
some reaching speeds of 500 revolutions per second. Studies of whole 
cells—and  isolated  cell  membranes—indicate  that  lipid  molecules  in 
cell  membranes  undergo  the  same  movements  as  they  do  in  synthetic 
bilayers. The movements of membrane phospholipid molecules are sum-
marized in Figure 11–14.

The Fluidity of a Lipid Bilayer Depends on Its Composition
The fluidity of a cell membrane—the ease with which its lipid molecules 
move within the plane of the bilayer—is important for membrane func-
tion and has to be maintained within certain limits. Just how fluid a lipid 
bilayer is at a given temperature depends on its phospholipid composi-
tion and, in particular, on the nature of the hydrocarbon tails: the closer 
and more regular the packing of the tails, the more viscous and less fluid 
the bilayer will be. Two major properties of hydrocarbon tails affect how 
tightly  they  pack  in  the  bilayer:  their  length  and  the  number  of  double 
bonds they contain. 

A  shorter  chain  length  reduces  the  tendency  of  the  hydrocarbon  tails 
to  interact  with  one  another  and  therefore  increases  the  fluidity  of  the 
bilayer. The hydrocarbon tails of membrane phospholipids vary in length 
between 14 and 24 carbon atoms, with 18–20 atoms being most usual. 
Most phospholipids contain one hydrocarbon tail that has one or more 
double  bonds  between  adjacent  carbon  atoms,  and  a  second  tail  with 
single  bonds  only  (see  Figure  11–6).  The  chain  that  harbors  a  double 
bond  does  not  contain  the  maximum  number  of  hydrogen  atoms  that 
could, in principle, be attached to its carbon backbone; it is thus said to 
be unsaturated with respect to hydrogen. The hydrocarbon tail with no 
double bonds has a full complement of hydrogen atoms and is said to be 
saturated. Each double bond in an unsaturated tail creates a small kink 
in  the  tail  (see  Figure  11–6),  which  makes  it  more  difficult  for  the  tails 
to pack against one another. For this reason, lipid bilayers that contain 
a large proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbon tails are more fluid than 
those with lower proportions.

In bacterial and yeast cells, which have to adapt to varying temperatures, 
both  the  lengths  and  the  unsaturation  of  the  hydrocarbon  tails  in  the 
bilayer are constantly adjusted to maintain the membrane at a relatively 
constant  fluidity:  at  higher  temperatures,  for  example,  the  cell  makes

membrane lipids with tails that are longer and that contain fewer dou-
ble bonds. A similar trick is used in the manufacture of margarine from 
vegetable oils. The fats produced by plants are generally unsaturated and 
therefore liquid at room temperature, unlike animal fats such as butter 
or lard, which are generally saturated and therefore solid at room tem-
perature. Margarine is made of hydrogenated vegetable oils; their double 
bonds have been removed by the addition of hydrogen, so that they are 
more solid and butterlike at room temperature.

In animal cells, membrane fluidity is modulated by the inclusion of the 
sterol cholesterol. This molecule is present in especially large amounts 
in the plasma membrane, where it constitutes approximately 20% of the 
lipids  in  the  membrane  by  weight.  Because  cholesterol  molecules  are 
short  and  rigid,  they  fill  the  spaces  between  neighboring  phospholipid 
molecules left by the kinks in their unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (Figure 
11–15).  In  this  way,  cholesterol  tends  to  stiffen  the  bilayer,  making  it 
less flexible, as well as less permeable. The chemical properties of mem-
brane  lipids—and  how  they  affect  membrane  fluidity—are  reviewed  in 
Movie 11.2.

For all cells, membrane fluidity is important for many reasons. It enables 
many  membrane  proteins  to  diffuse  rapidly  in  the  plane  of  the  bilayer 
and to interact with one another, as is crucial, for example, in cell signal-
ing (discussed in Chapter 16). It permits membrane lipids and proteins 
to diffuse from sites where they are inserted into the bilayer after their 
synthesis  to  other  regions  of  the  cell.  It  ensures  that  membrane  mole-
cules are distributed evenly between daughter cells when a cell divides. 
And, under appropriate conditions, it allows membranes to fuse with one 
another and mix their molecules (discussed in Chapter 15). If biological 
membranes  were  not  fluid,  it  is  hard  to  imagine  how  cells  could  live, 
grow, and reproduce. 

membrane Assembly Begins in the ER
In  eukaryotic  cells,  new  phospholipids  are  manufactured  by  enzymes 
bound  to  the  cytosolic  surface  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER;  see 
Figure  11–3).  Using  free  fatty  acids  as  substrates  (see  Panel  2–4,  
pp.  72–73),  the  enzymes  deposit  the  newly  made  phospholipids  exclu-
sively in the cytosolic half of the bilayer. 

Despite  this  preferential  treatment,  cell  membranes  manage  to  grow 
evenly. So how do new phospholipids make it to the opposite monolayer?

the Lipid Bilayer         

367

As  we  saw  in  Figure  11–14,  the  transfer  of  lipids  from  one  monolayer 
to the other rarely occur spontaneously. Instead, they are catalyzed by 
enzymes called scramblases, which remove randomly selected phosphol-
ipids from one half of the lipid bilayer and insert them in the other. As 
a result of this scrambling, newly made phospholipids are redistributed 
equally between each monolayer of the ER membrane (Figure 11–16a).

Some of this newly assembled membrane will remain in the ER; the rest 
will  be  used  to  supply  fresh  membrane  to  other  compartments  in  the 
cell. Bits of membrane are continually pinching off the ER to form small, 
spherical vesicles that then fuse with other membranes, such as those of 
the Golgi apparatus. Additional vesicles bubble from the Golgi to become 
incorporated into the plasma membrane. We discuss this dynamic proc-
ess of membrane transport in detail in Chapter 15.

Certain Phospholipids Are Confined to one side of the 
membrane
Most  cell  membranes  are  asymmetrical:  the  two  halves  of  the  bilayer 
often include strikingly different sets of phospholipids. But if membranes 
emerge from the ER with an evenly scrambled set of phospholipids, where 
does  this  asymmetry  arise?  It  begins  in  the  Golgi  apparatus.  The  Golgi 
membrane  contains  another  family  of  phospholipid-handling  enzyme, 
called flippases. These enzymes remove specific phospholipids from the 
side of the bilayer facing the exterior space and flip them into the monol-
ayer that faces the cytosol (Figure 11–16B). 

The  action  of  these  flippases—and  similar  enzymes  in  the  plasma 
membrane—initiates  and  maintains  the  asymmetric  arrangement  of 
phospholipids  that  is  characteristic  of  the  membranes  of  animal  cells. 
This asymmetry is preserved as membranes bud from one organelle and 
fuse with another—or with the plasma membrane. This means that all

It seems paradoxical that a

Figure 11–17 Membranes retain their orientation during transfer 
between cell compartments. Membranes are transported by a 
process of vesicle budding and fusing. here, a vesicle is shown 
budding from the Golgi apparatus and fusing with the plasma 
membrane. Note that the orientations of both the membrane lipids 
and proteins are preserved during the process: the original cytosolic 
surface of the lipid bilayer (green) remains facing the cytosol, and the 
noncytosolic surface (red ) continues to face away from the cytosol, 
toward the lumen of the Golgi or transport vesicle—or toward the 
extracellular compartment. Similarly, the glycoprotein shown here 
remains in the same orientation, with its attached sugar facing the 
noncytosolic side. 

cell membranes have distinct “inside” and “outside” faces: the cytosolic 
monolayer always faces the cytosol, while the noncytosolic monolayer 
is  exposed  to  either  the  cell  exterior—in  the  case  of  the  plasma  mem-
brane—or to the interior space (lumen) of an organelle. This conservation 
of  orientation  applies  not  only  to  the  phospholipids  that  make  up  the 
membrane, but to any proteins that might be inserted in the membrane 
(Figure 11–17). For membrane proteins, this positioning is very impor-
tant, as their orientation within the lipid bilayer is often crucial for their 
function (see Figure 11–19).

Among lipids, those that show the most dramatically lopsided distribu-
tion in cell membranes are the glycolipids, which are located mainly in 
the plasma membrane, and only in the noncytosolic half of the bilayer 
(Figure 11–18). Their sugar groups face the cell exterior, where they form 
part  of  a  continuous  coat  of  carbohydrate  that  surrounds  and  protects 
animal cells. Glycolipid molecules acquire their sugar groups in the Golgi 
apparatus, where the enzymes that engineer this chemical modification 
are  confined.  These  enzymes  are  oriented  such  that  sugars  are  added 
only  to  lipid  molecules  in  the  noncytosolic  half  of  the  bilayer.  Once  a 
glycolipid molecule has been created in this way, it remains trapped in 
this monolayer, as there are no flippases that transfer glycolipids to the 
cytosolic side. Thus, when a glycolipid molecule is finally delivered to the 
plasma membrane, it displays its sugars to the exterior of the cell.

Other lipid molecules show different types of asymmetric distributions, 
which relate to their specific functions. For example, the inositol phos-
pholipids—a minor component of the plasma membrane—have a special

exclusively in the noncytosolic monolayer of the membrane. Within the bilayer,

Although  the  lipid  bilayer  provides  the  basic  structure  of  all  cell 
membranes and serves as a permeability barrier to the hydrophilic mol-
ecules on either side of it, most membrane functions are carried out by  
membrane  proteins.  In  animals,  proteins  constitute  about  50%  of  the 
mass  of  most  plasma  membranes,  the  remainder  being  lipid  plus  the 
relatively  small  amounts  of  carbohydrate  found  on  some  of  the  lipids 
(glycolipids)  and  many  of  the  proteins  (glycoproteins).  Because  lipid 
molecules  are  much  smaller  than  proteins,  however,  a  cell  membrane 
typically contains about 50 times more lipid molecules than protein mol-
ecules (see Figure 11–4C).

Membrane  proteins  serve  many  functions.  Some  transport  particular 
nutrients, metabolites, and ions across the lipid bilayer. Others anchor 
the  membrane  to  macromolecules  on  either  side.  Still  others  function 
as receptors that detect chemical signals in the cell’s environment and 
relay them into the cell interior, or work as enzymes to catalyze specific 
reactions at the membrane (Figure 11–19 and table 11–1). Each type of 
cell membrane contains a different set of proteins, reflecting the special-
ized functions of the particular membrane. In this section, we discuss the 
structure  of  membrane  proteins  and  how  they  associate  with  the  lipid 
bilayer.

Figure 11–20 Membrane proteins can associate with the lipid bilayer in different ways. (a) transmembrane 
proteins extend across the bilayer as a single α helix, as multiple α helices, or as a rolled-up β sheet (called a 
β barrel). (B) Some membrane proteins are anchored to the cytosolic half of the lipid bilayer by an amphipathic 
α helix. (c) Others are linked to either side of the bilayer solely by a covalently attached lipid molecule (red zigzag 
lines). (D) Many proteins are attached to the membrane only by relatively weak, noncovalent interactions  
with other membrane proteins. all except (D) are integral membrane proteins.

membrane Proteins Associate with the Lipid Bilayer in 
Different Ways
Proteins can be associated with the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane in 
any one of the ways illustrated in Figure 11–20. 

1. Many membrane proteins extend through the bilayer, with part of 
their mass on either side (Figure 11–20A). Like their lipid neighbors, 
these transmembrane proteins are amphipathic, having both hydro-
phobic and hydrophilic regions. Their hydrophobic regions lie in the 
interior of the bilayer, nestled against the hydrophobic tails of the 
lipid molecules. Their hydrophilic regions are exposed to the aque-
ous environment on either side of the membrane. 

ECB4 e11.21/11.21

2. Other membrane proteins are located almost entirely in the cytosol 
and are associated with the cytosolic half of the lipid bilayer by an 
amphipathic α helix exposed on the surface of the protein (Figure 
11–20B). 

3. Some  proteins  lie  entirely  outside  the  bilayer,  on  one  side  or  the 
other,  attached  to  the  membrane  only  by  one  or  more  covalently 
attached lipid groups (Figure 11–20C). 

4. Yet other proteins are bound indirectly to one or the other face of 
the membrane, held in place only by their interactions with other 
membrane proteins (Figure 11–20D). 

Proteins that are directly attached to the lipid bilayer—whether they are 
transmembrane, associated with the lipid monolayer, or lipid-linked—can 
be removed only by disrupting the bilayer with detergents, as discussed 
shortly.  Such  proteins  are  known  as  integral  membrane  proteins.  The 
remaining membrane proteins are known as peripheral membrane pro-
teins; they can be released from the membrane by more gentle extraction 
procedures that interfere with protein–protein interactions but leave the 
lipid bilayer intact.

A Polypeptide Chain usually Crosses the Lipid Bilayer  
as an α Helix
All  membrane  proteins  have  a  unique  orientation  in  the  lipid  bilayer, 
which is essential for their function. For a transmembrane receptor pro-
tein, for example, the part of the protein that receives a signal from the 
environment  must  be  on  the  outside  of  the  cell,  whereas  the  part  that 
passes along the signal must be in the cytosol (see Figure 11–19). This 
orientation  is  a  consequence  of  the  way  in  which  membrane  proteins 
are synthesized (discussed in Chapter 15). The portions of a transmem-
brane  protein  located  on  either  side  of  the  lipid  bilayer  are  connected 
by  specialized  membrane-spanning  segments  of  the  polypeptide  chain 
(see Figure 11–20A). These segments, which run through the hydropho-
bic environment of the interior of the lipid bilayer, are composed largely 
of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. Because these side chains 
cannot form favorable interactions with water molecules, they prefer to 
interact with the hydrophobic tails of the lipid molecules, where no water 
is present.

In contrast to the hydrophobic side chains, however, the peptide bonds 
that join the successive amino acids in a protein are normally polar, mak-
ing the polypeptide backbone hydrophilic (Figure 11–21). Because water 
is  absent  from  the  interior  of  the  bilayer,  atoms  forming  the  backbone 
are driven to form hydrogen bonds with one another. Hydrogen-bonding 
is  maximized  if  the  polypeptide  chain  forms  a  regular  α  helix,  and  so 
the great majority of the membrane-spanning segments of polypeptide 
chains traverse the bilayer as α helices (see Figure 4–13). In these mem-
brane-spanning α helices, the hydrophobic side chains are exposed on 
the outside of the helix, where they contact the hydrophobic lipid tails, 
while atoms in the polypeptide backbone form hydrogen bonds with one 
another on the inside of the helix (Figure 11–22).

In  many  transmembrane  proteins,  the  polypeptide  chain  crosses  the 
membrane  only  once  (see  Figure  11–20A).  Many  of  these  single-pass 
transmembrane  proteins  are  receptors  for  extracellular  signals.  Other 
transmembrane  proteins  function  as  channels,  forming  aqueous  pores 
across the lipid bilayer to allow small, water-soluble molecules to cross 
the membrane. Such channels cannot be formed by proteins with a sin-
gle transmembrane α helix. Instead, they usually consist of a series of α 
helices that cross the bilayer a number of times (see Figure 11–20A). In 
many  of  these  multipass  transmembrane  proteins,  one  or  more  of  the 
membrane-spanning  regions  are  amphipathic—formed  from  α  helices 
that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid side chains. 
These  amino  acids  tend  to  be  arranged  so  that  the  hydrophobic  side 
chains fall on one side of the helix, while the hydrophilic side chains are 
concentrated on the other side. In the hydrophobic environment of the 
lipid  bilayer, α  helices  of  this  sort  pack  side  by  side  in  a  ring,  with  the 
hydrophobic side chains exposed to the lipids of the membrane and the 
hydrophilic side chains forming the lining of a hydrophilic pore through 
the lipid bilayer (Figure 11–23). How such channels function in the selec-
tive  transport  of  small,  water-soluble  molecules,  especially  inorganic 
ions, is discussed in Chapter 12.

Figure 11–22 a transmembrane polypeptide chain usually crosses 
the lipid bilayer as an α helix. In this segment of a transmembrane 
protein, the hydrophobic side chains (light green) of the amino acids 
forming the α helix contact the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails of the 
phospholipid molecules, while the hydrophilic parts of the polypeptide 
backbone form hydrogen bonds with one another in the interior of 
the helix. an α helix containing about 20 amino acids is required to 
completely traverse a cell membrane.

Explain why the polypeptide chain 
of most transmembrane proteins 
crosses the lipid bilayer as an α helix 
or a β barrel.

Figure 11–23 a transmembrane hydrophilic pore can be formed 
by multiple amphipathic α helices. In this example, five such 
transmembrane α helices form a water-filled channel across the lipid 
bilayer. the hydrophobic amino acid side chains (green) on one side of 
each helix contact the hydrophobic lipid tails, while the hydrophilic side 
chains (red) on the opposite side of the helices form a water-filled pore.

Although  the  α  helix  is  by  far  the  most  common  form  in  which  a 
polypeptide chain crosses a lipid bilayer, the polypeptide chain of some 
transmembrane  proteins  crosses  the  lipid  bilayer  as  a  β  sheet  that  is 
rolled into a cylinder, forming a keglike structure called a β barrel (see 
Figure  11–20A).  As  expected,  the  amino  acid  side  chains  that  face  the 
inside of the barrel, and therefore line the aqueous channel, are mostly 
hydrophilic, while those on the outside of the barrel, which contact the 
hydrophobic  core  of  the  lipid  bilayer,  are  exclusively  hydrophobic.  The 
most striking example of a β-barrel structure is found in the porin pro-
teins, which form large, water-filled pores in mitochondrial and bacterial 
outer membranes (Figure  11–24). Mitochondria and some bacteria are 
surrounded  by  a  double  membrane,  and  porins  allow  the  passage  of 
small nutrients, metabolites, and inorganic ions across their outer mem-
branes, while preventing unwanted larger molecules from crossing.

membrane Proteins Can Be solubilized in Detergents
To understand a protein fully, one needs to know its structure in detail. 
For membrane proteins, this presents special problems. Most biochemi-
cal procedures are designed for studying molecules in aqueous solution. 
Membrane proteins, however, are built to operate in an environment that 
is partly aqueous and partly fatty, and taking them out of this environ-
ment and purifying them while preserving their essential structure is no 
easy task.

Before  an  individual  protein  can  be  studied  in  detail,  it  must  be  sepa-
rated from all the other cell proteins. For most membrane proteins, the 
first step in this separation process involves solubilizing the membrane 
with  agents  that  destroy  the  lipid  bilayer  by  disrupting  hydrophobic 
associations.  The  most  widely  used  disruptive  agents  are  detergents 
(Movie  11.3).  These  small,  amphipathic,  lipidlike  molecules  differ  from 
membrane  phospholipids  in  that  they  have  only  a  single  hydrophobic 
tail (Figure 11–25). Because they have one tail, detergent molecules are 
shaped like cones; in water, they thus tend to aggregate into small clus-
ters called micelles, rather than forming a bilayer as do the phospholipids, 
which—with their two tails—are more cylindrical in shape. 

When mixed in great excess with membranes, the hydrophobic ends of 
detergent molecules interact with the membrane-spanning hydrophobic 
regions of the transmembrane proteins, as well as with the hydrophobic

filled channels in the outer membrane

from E. coli, and it consists of a 16-stranded 
β sheet curved around on itself to form a 
transmembrane water-filled channel. the

shown in the drawing, three porin proteins 
associate to form a trimer, which has three 
separate channels.

detergents. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a strong ionic detergent—
that is, it has an ionized (charged) group at its hydrophilic end. triton 
X-100 is a mild nonionic detergent—that is, it has a nonionized but 
polar structure at its hydrophilic end. the hydrophobic portion of each 
detergent is shown in blue, and the hydrophilic portion in red. the 
bracketed portion of triton X-100 is repeated about eight times. Strong

tails  of  the  phospholipid  molecules,  thereby  disrupting  the  lipid  bilayer 
and  separating  the  proteins  from  most  of  the  phospholipids.  Because 
the  other  end  of  the  detergent  molecule  is  hydrophilic,  these  interac-
tions  bring  the  membrane  proteins  into  solution  as  protein–detergent 
complexes; at the same time, the detergent solubilizes the phospholipids 
(Figure 11–26). The protein–detergent complexes can then be separated 
from  one  another  and  from  the  lipid–detergent  complexes  for  further 
analysis.

We Know the Complete structure of Relatively Few 
membrane Proteins
For  many  years,  much  of  what  we  knew  about  the  structure  of  mem-
brane  proteins  was  learned  by  indirect  means.  The  standard  method 
for determining a protein’s three-dimensional structure directly is X-ray 
crystallography  (see  Figure  4–52),  but  this  requires  ordered  crystalline 
arrays of the molecule. Because membrane proteins have to be purified in 
detergent micelles that are often heterogeneous in size, they are harder 
to  crystallize  than  the  soluble  proteins  that  inhabit  the  cell  cytosol  or 
extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, with recent advances in protein prepa-
ration and X-ray crystallography, the structures of an increasing number 
of membrane proteins have now been determined to high resolution.

One example is bacteriorhodopsin, the structure of which first revealed 
exactly  how  α  helices  cross  the  lipid  bilayer.  Bacteriorhodopsin  is  a 
small  protein  (about  250  amino  acids)  found  in  large  amounts  in  the 
plasma membrane of an archaean, called Halobacterium halobium, that 
lives in salt marshes. Bacteriorhodopsin acts as a membrane transport 
protein that pumps H+ (protons) out of the cell. Pumping requires energy, 
and bacteriorhodopsin gets its energy directly from sunlight. Each bac-
teriorhodopsin  molecule  contains  a  single  light-absorbing  nonprotein

red portions of the molecules are 
hydrophilic and the blue portions 
hydrophobic. Draw a short stretch

a proton pump. the polypeptide chain 
crosses the lipid bilayer as seven α helices. 
the location of the retinal (purple) and 
the probable pathway taken by protons 
during the light-activated pumping cycle 
(red arrows) are highlighted. Strategically 
placed polar amino acid side chains, 
shown in red, yellow, and blue, guide the 
movement of the proton across the bilayer, 
allowing the proton to avoid contact with 
the lipid environment. the proton-transfer

molecule,  called  retinal,  that  gives  the  protein—and  the  bacterium—
a  deep  purple  color.  This  small  hydrophobic  molecule  is  covalently 
attached to one of bacteriorhodopsin’s seven transmembrane α helices 
(Figure 11–27). When retinal absorbs a photon of light, it changes shape, 
and  in  doing  so,  it  causes  the  protein  embedded  in  the  lipid  bilayer  to 
undergo a series of small conformational changes. These changes result 
in the transfer of one H+ from the retinal to the outside of the bacterium 
(see Figure 11–27). The retinal is then regenerated by taking up a H+ from 
the cytosol, returning the protein to its original conformation so that it 
can  repeat  the  cycle.  The  overall  outcome  is  the  movement  of  one  H+ 
from inside to outside the cell. 

ECB4 e11.28/11.28

In  the  presence  of  sunlight,  thousands  of  bacteriorhodopsin  mole-
cules  pump  H+  out  of  the  cell,  generating  a  concentration  gradient  of 
H+ across the plasma membrane. The cell uses this proton gradient to 
store energy and convert it into ATP, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 
14. Bacteriorhodopsin is a pump protein, a class of transmembrane pro-
tein that actively moves small organic molecules and inorganic ions into 
and out of cells (see Figure 11–19). We will meet other pump proteins in 
Chapter 12. 

The Plasma membrane Is Reinforced by the underlying 
Cell Cortex
A cell membrane by itself is extremely thin and fragile. It would require 
nearly 10,000 cell membranes laid on top of one another to achieve the 
thickness of this paper. Most cell membranes are therefore strengthened 
and supported by a framework of proteins, attached to the membrane via 
transmembrane proteins. For plants, yeasts, and bacteria, the cell’s shape 
and  mechanical  properties  are  conferred  by  a  rigid  cell  wall—a  mesh-
work  of  proteins,  sugars,  and  other  macromolecules  that  encases  the 
plasma membrane. By contrast, the plasma membrane of animal cells is 
stabilized by a meshwork of fibrous proteins, called the cell cortex, that is 
attached to the underside of the membrane.

The  cortex  of  human  red  blood  cells  is  a  relatively  simple  and  regular 
structure and has been especially well studied. These cells are small and 
have a distinctive flattened shape (Figure 11–28). The main component 
of  their  cortex  is  the  dimeric  protein  spectrin,  a  long,  thin,  flexible  rod

about 100 nm in length. It forms a meshwork that provides support for 
the  plasma  membrane  and  maintains  the  cell’s  biconcave  shape.  The 
spectrin meshwork is connected to the membrane through intracellular 
attachment proteins that link the spectrin to specific transmembrane pro-
teins (Figure 11–29 and Movie 11.5). The importance of this meshwork 
is seen in mice and humans that have genetic abnormalities in spectrin 
structure. These individuals are anemic: they have fewer red blood cells 
than normal. The red cells they do have are spherical instead of flattened 
and are abnormally fragile.

ECB4 e11.30/11.30

Proteins similar to spectrin and to its associated attachment proteins are 
present in the cortex of most animal cells. But the cortex in these cells is 
especially rich in actin and the motor protein myosin, and it is much more 
complex than that of red blood cells. While red blood cells need their cor-
tex mainly to provide mechanical strength as they are pumped through 
blood vessels, other cells also need their cortex to allow them to selec-
tively take up materials from their environment, to change their shape 
actively, and to move, as we discuss in Chapter 17. In addition, cells use 
their cortex to restrain the diffusion of proteins within the plasma mem-
brane, as we see next.

Figure 11–30 Formation of mouse–
human hybrid cells shows that some 
plasma membrane proteins can move 
laterally in the lipid bilayer. When the 
mouse and human cells are first fused, their 
proteins are confined to their own halves 
of the newly formed hybrid-cell plasma 
membrane. Within a short time, however, 
they completely intermix. to monitor 
the movement of a selected sampling of 
these proteins, the cells are labeled with 
antibodies that bind to either human 
or mouse proteins; the antibodies are 
coupled to two different fluorescent tags—
rhodamine (red) or fluorescein (green)—so 
they can be distinguished in a fluorescence 
microscope (see panel 4–2, pp. 146–147).

A Cell Can Restrict the movement of Its membrane 
Proteins
Because  a  membrane  is  a  two-dimensional  fluid,  many  of  its  proteins, 
like its lipids, can move freely within the plane of the lipid bilayer. This 
lateral  diffusion  was  initially  demonstrated  by  experimentally  fusing  a 
mouse cell with a human cell to form a double-sized hybrid cell and then 
monitoring the distribution of certain mouse and human plasma mem-
brane proteins. At first, the mouse and human proteins are confined to 
their own halves of the newly formed hybrid cell, but within half an hour 
or so the two sets of proteins become evenly mixed over the entire cell 
surface (Figure 11–30). We describe some other techniques for studying 
the movement of membrane proteins in how We Know, pp. 378–379.

The  picture  of  a  cell  membrane  as  a  sea  of  lipid  in  which  all  proteins 
float freely is too simple, however. Cells have ways of confining particular 
proteins to localized areas within the bilayer membrane, thereby creating 
functionally specialized regions, or membrane domains, on the cell or 
organelle surface. 
As illustrated in Figure 11–31, plasma membrane proteins can be teth-
ered  to  structures  outside  the  cell—for  example,  to  molecules  in  the 
extracellular matrix or on an adjacent cell (discussed in Chapter 20)—or 
to relatively immobile structures inside the cell, especially to the cell cor-
tex (see Figure 11–29). Additionally, cells can create barriers that restrict 
particular  membrane  components  to  one  membrane  domain.  In  epi-
thelial cells that line the gut, for example, it is important that transport 
proteins involved in the uptake of nutrients from the gut be confined to 

Figure 11–31 the lateral mobility of 
plasma membrane proteins can be 
restricted in several ways. proteins can be 
tethered to the cell cortex inside the cell (a), 
to extracellular matrix molecules outside 
the cell (B), or to proteins on the surface of 
another cell (c). Diffusion barriers (shown 
as black bars) can restrict proteins to a 
particular membrane domain (D).

that supports all epithelial sheets (discussed 
in chapter 20).

basal and lateral surfaces (see Figure 12–17). This asymmetric distribution 
of membrane proteins is maintained by a barrier formed along the line 
where  the  cell  is  sealed  to  adjacent  epithelial  cells  by  a  so-called  tight 
junction (Figure 11–32). At this site, specialized junctional proteins form 
a continuous belt around the cell where the cell contacts its neighbors, 
creating a seal between adjacent plasma membranes (see Figure 20–23). 
Membrane proteins cannot diffuse past the junction.

The Cell surface Is Coated with Carbohydrate
We saw earlier that some of the lipids in the outer layer of the plasma 
membrane  have  sugars  covalently  attached  to  them.  The  same  is  true 
for  most  of  the  proteins  in  the  plasma  membrane.  The  great  majority 
of  these  proteins  have  short  chains  of  sugars,  called  oligosaccharides, 
linked to them; they are called glycoproteins. Other membrane proteins, 
the proteoglycans, contain one or more long polysaccharide chains. All of 
the carbohydrate on the glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids is 
located on the outside of the plasma membrane, where it forms a sugar 
coating called the carbohydrate layer or glycocalyx (Figure 11–33).

This layer of carbohydrate helps protect the cell surface from mechanical 
damage. As the oligosaccharides and polysaccharides adsorb water, they 
also give the cell a slimy surface, which helps motile cells such as white 
blood cells squeeze through narrow spaces and prevents blood cells from 
sticking to one another or to the walls of blood vessels.

An  essential  feature  of  the  lipid  bilayer  is  its  fluidity, 
which  is  crucial  for  cell  membrane  integrity  and  func-
tion.  This  property  allows  many  membrane-embedded 
proteins  to  move  laterally  in  the  plane  of  the  bilayer, 
so that they can engage in the various protein–protein 
interactions on which cells depend. The fluid nature of 
cell  membranes  is  so  central  to  their  proper  function 
that  it  may  seem  surprising  that  this  property  was  not 
recognized until the early 1970s.

Given its importance for membrane structure and func-
tion, how do we measure and study the fluidity of cell 
membranes?  The  most  common  methods  are  visual: 
simply label some of the molecules native to the mem-
brane  and  then  watch  them  move.  Such  an  approach 
first  demonstrated  the  lateral  movement  of  membrane 
proteins  that  had  been  tagged  with  labeled  antibodies 
(see Figure 11–30). This experiment seemed to suggest 
that  membrane  proteins  diffuse  freely,  without  restric-
tion,  in  an  open  sea  of  lipids.  We  now  know  that  this 
image is not entirely accurate. To probe membrane flu-
idity  more  thoroughly,  researchers  had  to  invent  more 
precise methods for tracking the movement of proteins 
within a membrane such as the plasma membrane of a 
living cell.

The FRAP attack
One such technique, called fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching (FRAP), involves uniformly labeling the 

components  of  the  cell  membrane—its  lipids  or,  more 
often, its proteins—with some sort of fluorescent marker. 
Labeling  membrane  proteins  can  be  accomplished  by 
incubating living cells with a fluorescent antibody or by 
covalently attaching a fluorescent protein such as green 
fluorescent  protein  (GFP)  to  a  membrane  protein  of 
interest using recombinant DNA techniques (discussed 
in Chapter 10). 

Once a protein has been labeled, a small patch of mem-
brane is irradiated with an intense pulse of light from a 
sharply focused laser beam. This treatment irreversibly 
“bleaches” the fluorescence from the labeled proteins in 
that small patch of membrane, typically an area about 
1 μm square. The fluorescence of this irradiated mem-
brane is monitored in a fluorescence microscope, and the 
amount of time it takes for the neighboring, unbleached 
fluorescent proteins to migrate into the bleached region 
of the membrane is measured (Figure 11–34). The rate 
of this “fluorescence recovery” is a direct measure of the 
rate at which the protein molecules can diffuse within 
the  membrane  (Movie  11.6).  Such  experiments  have 
revealed  that,  generally  speaking,  a  cell  membrane  is 
about as viscous as olive oil.

One  drawback  to  the  FRAP  approach  is  that  the  tech-

Figure 11–34 photobleaching techniques can be used to measure 
the rate of lateral diffusion of a membrane protein. a specific 
protein of interest can be labeled with a fluorescent antibody (as shown 
here) or can be produced—using genetic engineering techniques—as 
a fusion protein tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFp), which is 
intrinsically fluorescent. In the Frap technique, fluorescent molecules 
are bleached in a small area of membrane using a laser beam. the 
fluorescence intensity recovers as the bleached molecules diffuse away 
and unbleached, fluorescent molecules diffuse in (shown here in side 
and top views). the diffusion coefficient is calculated from a graph of 
the rate of fluorescence recovery: the greater the diffusion coefficient 
of the membrane protein, the faster the recovery.

large  area  of  the  membrane.  With  this  technique  it  is 
impossible to track the motion of individual molecules. 
If the labeled proteins fail to migrate into the bleached 
zone  over  the  course  of  a  FRAP  study,  for  example,  is 
it  because  they  are  immobile,  essentially  anchored  in 
one place in the membrane? Or, alternatively, are they 
restricted  to  movement  within  a  very  small  region—
fenced in by cytoskeletal proteins—and thus only appear 
motionless?

To get around this problem, researchers have developed 
methods  for  labeling  and  observing  the  movement  of 
individual molecules or small clusters of molecules. One 
such  technique,  dubbed  single-particle  tracking  (SPT) 
microscopy,  relies  on  tagging  protein  molecules  with 
antibody-coated  gold  nanoparticles.  The  gold  particles 
look like tiny black dots when seen with a light micro-
scope, and their movement, and thus the movement of 
individually tagged protein molecules, can be followed 
using video microscopy. 

From  the  studies  carried  out  to  date,  it  appears  that 
membrane proteins can display a variety of patterns of 
movement,  from  random  diffusion  to  complete  immo-
bility  (Figure  11–35).  Some  proteins  rapidly  switch 
between these different kinds of motion. 

Freed from cells
In many cases, researchers wish to study the behavior 
of a particular type of membrane protein in a synthetic 
lipid bilayer, in the absence of other proteins that might 
restrain its movement or alter its activity. For such stud-
ies, membrane proteins can be isolated from cells and 
the protein of interest purified and reconstituted in arti-
ficial  phospholipid  vesicles  (Figure  11–36).  The  lipids

It is apparent from such studies that membrane proteins 
diffuse  more  freely  and  rapidly  in  artificial  lipid  bilay-
ers than in cell membranes. The fact that most proteins 
show reduced mobility in a cell membrane makes sense, 
as  these  membranes  are  crowded  with  many  types  of 
proteins and contain a greater variety of lipids than an 
artificial  lipid  bilayer.  Furthermore,  many  membrane 
proteins in a cell are tethered to proteins in the extracel-
lular  matrix,  or  anchored  to  the  cell  cortex  just  under 
the plasma membrane, or both (as illustrated in Figure 
11–31). 

Taken  together,  such  studies  have  revolutionized  our 
understanding of membrane proteins and of the archi-
tecture and organization of cell membranes.

Figure 11–37 the recognition of the

is the first stage of their migration out of 
the blood at sites of infection. Specialized 
transmembrane proteins (called lectins) are 
made by the endothelial cells lining the 
blood vessel in response to chemical signals 
emanating from a site of infection. these 
proteins recognize particular sugar groups 
carried by glycolipids and glycoproteins 
on the surface of neutrophils (a type of 
white blood cell) circulating in the blood. 
the neutrophils consequently stick to the 
endothelial cells that line the blood vessel 
wall. this association is not very strong, 
but it leads to another, much stronger 
protein–protein interaction (not shown) 
that helps the neutrophil slip between the 
endothelial cells, so it can migrate out of 
the bloodstream and into the tissue at the 
site of infection (Movie 11.7). 

TISSUE

SITE OF INFECTION 

Cell-surface  carbohydrates  do  more  than  just  protect  and  lubricate 
the  cell,  however.  They  have  an  important  role  in  cell–cell  recognition 
and adhesion. Just as many proteins will recognize a particular site on 
another protein, proteins called lectins are specialized to bind to particular 
oligosaccharide side chains. The oligosaccharide side chains of glycopro-
teins and glycolipids, although short (typically fewer than 15 sugar units), 
are enormously diverse. Unlike proteins, in which the amino acids are all 
joined together in a linear chain by identical peptide bonds, sugars can be 
joined together in many different arrangements, often forming elaborate 
branched structures (see Panel 2–3, pp. 70–71). Using a variety of cova-
lent linkages, even three different sugars can form hundreds of different 
trisaccharides.

ECB4 E11.39/11.39

The carbohydrate layer on the surface of cells in a multicellular organism 
serves as a kind of distinctive clothing, like a police officer’s uniform. It is 
characteristic of each cell type and is recognized by other cell types that 
interact  with  it.  Specific  oligosaccharides  in  the  carbohydrate  layer  are 
involved, for example, in the recognition of an egg by a sperm (discussed 
in Chapter 19). Similarly, in the early stages of a bacterial infection, the 
carbohydrate on the surface of white blood cells called neutrophils is rec-
ognized  by  a  lectin  on  the  cells  lining  the  blood  vessels  at  the  site  of 
infection; this recognition causes the neutrophils to adhere to the blood 
vessel wall and then migrate from the bloodstream into the infected tis-
sue, where they help destroy the invading bacteria (Figure 11–37).

Transport Across Cell 
Membranes

To survive and grow, cells must be able to exchange molecules with their 
environment. They must import nutrients such as sugars and amino acids 
and eliminate metabolic waste products. They must also regulate the con-
centrations of a variety of inorganic ions in their cytosol and organelles. 
A few molecules, such as CO2 and O2, can simply diffuse across the lipid 
bilayer of the plasma membrane. But the vast majority cannot. Instead, 
their transfer depends on specialized membrane transport proteins that 
span  the  lipid  bilayer,  providing  private  passageways  across  the  mem-
brane for select substances (Figure 12–1). 

In  this  chapter,  we  consider  how  cell  membranes  control  the  traffic  of 
inorganic ions and small, water-soluble molecules into and out of the cell 
and its membrane-enclosed organelles. Cells can also selectively transfer 
macromolecules such as proteins across their membranes, but this trans-
port requires more elaborate machinery and is discussed in Chapter 15. 

We begin by outlining some of the general principles that guide the pas-
sage  of  ions  and  small  molecules  through  cell  membranes.  We  then 
examine, in turn, the two main classes of membrane proteins that medi-
ate  this  transfer:  transporters  and  channels.  Transporters  shift  small 
organic molecules or inorganic ions from one side of the membrane to 
the other by changing shape. Channels, in contrast, form tiny hydrophilic 
pores across the membrane through which such substances can pass by 
diffusion. Most channels only permit passage of inorganic ions and are 
therefore called ion channels. Because these ions are electrically charged, 
their movements can create a powerful electric force—or voltage—across 
the membrane. In the final part of the chapter, we discuss how these volt-
age  differences  enable  nerve  cells  to  communicate—and  ultimately  to 
shape our behavior.

ChApTer 12     transport across cell Membranes

Figure 12–1 Cell membranes contain 
specialized membrane transport 
proteins that facilitate the passage of 
selected small water-soluble molecules. 
(a) protein-free, artificial lipid bilayers 
such as liposomes (see Figure 11–13) 
are impermeable to most water-soluble 
molecules. (B) cell membranes, by contrast, 
contain transport proteins, each of which 
transfers a particular type of molecule. this 
selective transport can include the active 
pumping of specific molecules either out 
of (purple triangles) or into (green bars) 
the cell. the combined action of different 
transport proteins allows a specific set of 
solutes to build up inside a membrane-
enclosed compartment, such as the cytosol 
or an organelle.

Figure 12–2 The rate at which a molecule 
crosses a protein-free artificial lipid 
bilayer by simple diffusion depends on 
its size and solubility. the smaller the 
molecule and, more importantly, the fewer 
its favorable interactions with water (that 
is, the less polar it is), the more rapidly the 
molecule diffuses across the bilayer. Note 
that many of the organic molecules that a 
cell uses as nutrients (shaded in red ) are too 
large and polar to pass through an artificial 
lipid bilayer that does not contain the 
appropriate membrane-transport proteins.

principles of TrAnsmembrAne TrAnsporT
As  we  saw  in  Chapter  11,  the  hydrophobic  interior  of  the  lipid  bilayer 
creates a barrier to the passage of most hydrophilic molecules, including 
all ions. These molecules are as reluctant to enter a fatty environment 
as  hydrophobic  molecules  are  reluctant  to  enter  water.  But  cells  and 
organelles must also allow the passage of many hydrophilic, water-solu-
ble molecules, such as inorganic ions, sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, 
and other cell metabolites. These molecules cross lipid bilayers far too 
slowly by simple diffusion, so their passage across cell membranes must 
be  accelerated  by  specialized  membrane  transport  proteins—a  process 
called facilitated transport. In this section, we review the basic principles 
of  such  facilitated  transmembrane  transport  and  introduce  the  various 
types of membrane transport proteins that mediate this movement. We 
also discuss why the transport of inorganic ions, in particular, is of such 
fundamental importance for all cells.

lipid bilayers Are impermeable to ions and most 
uncharged polar molecules
Given  enough  time,  virtually  any  molecule  will  diffuse  across  a  lipid 
bilayer. The rate at which it diffuses, however, varies enormously depend-
ing on the size of the molecule and its solubility properties. In general, 
the smaller the molecule and the more hydrophobic, or nonpolar, it is, the 
more rapidly it will diffuse across the membrane. 

Of course, many of the molecules that are of interest to cells are polar 
and water-soluble. These solutes—substances that, in this case, are dis-
solved in water—are unable to cross the lipid bilayer without the aid of 
membrane transport proteins. The relative ease with which a variety of 
solutes can cross cell membranes is shown in Figure 12–2.

 

 

 

1.  Small nonpolar molecules, such as molecular oxygen (O2, molecu-
lar mass 32 daltons) and carbon dioxide (CO2, 44 daltons), dissolve 
readily in lipid bilayers and therefore rapidly diffuse across them; 
indeed, cells depend on this permeability to gases for the cell res-
piration processes discussed in Chapter 14. 

2.  Uncharged polar molecules (molecules with an uneven distribution 
of electric charge) also diffuse readily across a bilayer if they are 
small enough. Water (H2O, 18 daltons) and ethanol (46 daltons), 
for example, cross at a measureable rate, while glycerol (92 dal-
tons) crosses less rapidly. Larger uncharged polar molecules such 
as glucose (180 daltons) cross hardly at all. 

3.  In  contrast,  lipid  bilayers  are  highly  impermeable  to  all  charged 
molecules, including all inorganic ions, no matter how small. These 
molecules’ charges and their strong electrical attraction to water 

principles of transmembrane transport

molecules inhibit their entry into the inner, hydrocarbon phase of 
the  bilayer.  Thus  synthetic  lipid  bilayers  are  a  billion  (109)  times 
more permeable to water than they are to even small ions such as 
Na+ or K+.

The ion concentrations inside a cell Are very different 
from Those outside
Because cell membranes are impermeable to inorganic ions, living cells 
are able to maintain internal ion concentrations that are very different 
from the concentrations of ions in the media that surrounds them. These 
differences in ion concentration are crucial for a cell’s survival and func-
tion. Among the most important inorganic ions for cells are Na+, K+, Ca2+, 
Cl–, and H+ (protons). The movement of these ions across cell membranes 
plays an essential part in many biological processes, but is perhaps most 
striking in the production of ATP by all cells, and in communication by 
nerve cells (to be discussed later).
Na+ is the most plentiful positively charged ion (cation) outside the cell, 
whereas K+ is the most abundant inside (Table 12–1). For a cell to avoid 
being torn apart by electrical forces, the quantity of positive charge inside 
the cell must be balanced by an almost exactly equal quantity of nega-
tive charge, and the same is true for the charge in the surrounding fluid. 
The  high  concentration  of  Na+  outside  the  cell  is  electrically  balanced 
chiefly by extracellular Cl–, whereas the high concentration of K+ inside 
is balanced by a variety of negatively charged organic and inorganic ions 
(anions) including nucleic acids, proteins, and many cell metabolites (see 
Table 12–1). 

differences in the concentration of inorganic ions Across a 
cell membrane create a membrane potential
Although the electrical charges inside and outside the cell are generally 
kept  in  balance,  tiny  excesses  of  positive  or  negative  charge,  concen-
trated  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  plasma  membrane,  do  occur.  Such 
electrical imbalances generate a voltage difference across the membrane 
called the membrane potential.

ChApTer 12     transport across cell Membranes

When a cell is “unstimulated,” the exchange of anions and cations across 
the  membrane  will  be  precisely  balanced.  In  such  steady-state  condi-
tions, the voltage difference across the cell membrane—called the resting 
membrane potential—holds steady. But it is not zero. In animal cells, for 
example, the resting membrane potential can be anywhere between –20 
and –200 millivolts (mV), depending on the organism and cell type. The 
value is expressed as a negative number because the interior of the cell 
is more negatively charged than the exterior. This membrane potential 
allows cells to power the transport of certain metabolites and provides 
those  cells  that  are  excitable  with  a  means  to  communicate  with  their 
neighbors.

It is the activity of membrane transport proteins embedded in the bilayer 
that enables cells to establish and maintain their membrane potential, as 
we discuss next.

cells contain Two classes of membrane Transport 
proteins: Transporters and channels
Membrane transport proteins occur in many forms and are present in all 
cell membranes. Each provides a private portal across the membrane for 
a particular small, water-soluble molecule—an ion, sugar, or amino acid, 
for example. Most of these proteins allow passage of only select mem-
bers of a particular molecular class: some permit transit of Na+ but not K+, 
others K+ but not Na+, and so on. Each type of cell membrane has its own 
characteristic set of transport proteins, which determines exactly which 
solutes can pass into and out of the cell or an organelle. 

As  discussed  in  Chapter  11,  most  membrane  transport  proteins  have 
polypeptide chains that traverse the lipid bilayer multiple times—that is, 
they are multipass transmembrane proteins (see Figure 11–23). By criss-
crossing back and forth across the bilayer, the polypeptide chain forms a 
continuous protein-lined pathway that allows selected small, hydrophilic 
molecules  to  cross  the  membrane  without  coming  into  direct  contact 
with the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer.

There are two main classes of membrane transport proteins: transporters 
and channels. These proteins differ in the way they discriminate between 
solutes,  transporting  some  but  not  others  (Figure  12–3).  Channels  dis-
criminate  mainly  on  the  basis  of  size  and  electric  charge:  when  the 
channel is open, any ion or molecule that is small enough and carries the 
appropriate charge can pass through. A transporter, on the other hand, 
transfers only those molecules or ions that fit into specific binding sites 
on the protein. Transporters bind their solutes with great specificity, in the 
same way an enzyme binds its substrate, and it is this requirement for 
specific binding that gives transporters their selectivity.

(B) a channel, when open, forms a pore 
across the bilayer through which specific 
inorganic ions or, in some cases, polar 
organic molecules can diffuse. as would 
be expected, channels transfer solutes at a 
much greater rate than transporters. 
   Ion channels can exist in either an open or 
a closed conformation, and they transport 
only in the open conformation, which is 
shown here. channel opening and closing is 
usually controlled by an external stimulus or 
by conditions within the cell.

Figure 12–4 solutes cross cell membranes 
by either passive or active transport. 
Some small nonpolar molecules such as 
cO2 (see Figure 12–2) can move passively 
down their concentration gradient across 
the lipid bilayer by simple diffusion, without 
the help of a transport protein. Most 
solutes, however, require the assistance of 
a channel or transporter. passive transport, 
which allows molecules to move down 
their concentration gradients, occurs 
spontaneously; whereas active transport 
against a concentration gradient requires an 
input of energy. Only transporters can carry 
out active transport.

cell or organelle—or out of it? In many cases, the direction of transport 
depends only on the relative concentrations of the solute on either side 
of the membrane. Molecules will spontaneously flow “downhill” from a 
region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, provided a 
pathway exists. Such movements are called passive, because they need 
no additional driving force. If, for example, a solute is present at a higher 
concentration outside the cell than inside, and an appropriate channel 
or transporter is present in the plasma membrane, the solute will move 
into the cell by passive transport, without expenditure of energy by the 
transport protein. This is because even though the solute moves in both 
directions across the membrane, more solute will move in than out until 
the two concentrations equilibrate. All channels and many transporters 
act as conduits for such passive transport.

To move a solute against its concentration gradient, a membrane trans-
port protein must do work: it has to drive the flow “uphill” by coupling it 
to some other process that provides an input of energy (as discussed in 
Chapter  3  for  enzyme-catalyzed  reactions).  The  movement  of  a  solute 
against its concentration gradient in this way is termed active transport, 
and it is carried out by special types of transporters called pumps, which 
harness an energy source to power the transport process (Figure 12–4). 
As discussed later, this energy can come from ATP hydrolysis, a trans-
membrane ion gradient, or sunlight. 

both the concentration gradient and membrane potential 
influence the passive Transport of charged solutes
For an uncharged molecule, the direction of passive transport is deter-
mined solely by its concentration gradient, as we have implied above. 
But for electrically charged molecules, whether inorganic ions or small 
organic molecules, an additional force comes into play. As mentioned 
earlier, most cell membranes have a voltage across them—a difference 
in charge referred to as a membrane potential. The membrane poten-
tial exerts a force on any molecule that carries an electric charge. The 
cytosolic side of the plasma membrane is usually at a negative potential 
relative  to  the  extracellular  side,  so  the  membrane  potential  tends  to 
pull positively charged solutes into the cell and drive negatively charged 
ones out.

At the same time, a charged solute will also tend to move down its con-
centration gradient. The net force driving a charged solute across a cell 
membrane is therefore a composite of two forces, one due to the concen-
tration gradient and the other due to the membrane potential. This net 
driving force, called the solute’s electrochemical gradient, determines 

388 

ChApTer 12     transport across cell Membranes

Figure 12–5 An electrochemical gradient 
has two components. the net driving force 
(the electrochemical gradient) tending to 
move a charged solute (ion) across a cell 
membrane is the sum of a force from the 
concentration gradient of the solute and 
a force from the membrane potential. the 
membrane potential is represented here 
by the + and – signs on opposite sides of 
the membrane. the width of the green 
arrow represents the magnitude of the 
electrochemical gradient for a positively 
charged solute in two different situations. 
In (a), the concentration gradient and 
membrane potential work together to 
increase the driving force for movement of 
the solute. In (B), the membrane potential 
acts against the concentration gradient, 
decreasing the electrochemical driving 
force.

the direction that each solute will flow across the membrane by passive 
transport. For some ions, the voltage and concentration gradients work 
in the same direction, creating a relatively steep electrochemical gradi-
ent (Figure 12–5A). This is the case for Na+, which is positively charged 
and at a higher concentration outside cells than inside (see Table 12–1). 
Na+ therefore tends to enter cells if given an opportunity. If, however, the 
voltage and concentration gradients have opposing effects, the resulting 
electrochemical  gradient  can  be  small  (Figure  12–5b).  This  is  the  case 
for K+, which is present at a much higher concentration inside cells than 
outside. Because of its small electrochemical gradient across the resting 
plasma membrane, there is little net movement of K+ across the mem-
brane even when K+ channels are open.

Water moves passively Across cell membranes down its 
concentration gradient—a process called osmosis
Cells are mostly water (generally about 70% by weight), and so the move-
ment  of  water  across  cell  membranes  is  crucially  important  for  living 
things. Because water molecules are small and uncharged, they can dif-
fuse directly across the lipid bilayer—although slowly (see Figure 12–2). 
However,  some  cells  also  contain  specialized  channel  proteins  called 
aquaporins in their plasma membrane, which greatly facilitate this flow 
(Figure 12–6 and Movie 12.1).

But which way does water tend to flow? As we saw in Table 12–1, cells 
contain  a  high  concentration  of  solutes,  including  many  charged  mol-
ecules and ions. Thus the total concentration of solute particles inside 
the cell—also called its osmolarity—generally exceeds solute concentra-
tion outside the cell. The resulting osmotic gradient tends to “pull” water 
into the cell. This movement of water down its concentration gradient—
from an area of low solute concentration (high water concentration) to 
an area of high solute concentration (low water concentration)—is called 
osmosis.

Osmosis, if it occurs without constraint, can make a cell swell. Different 
cells  cope  with  this  osmotic  challenge  in  different  ways.  Most  animal 

Figure 12–6 water molecules diffuse rapidly through aquaporin 
channels in the plasma membrane of some cells. (a) Shaped like 
an hourglass, each aquaporin channel forms a pore across the bilayer, 
allowing the selective passage of water molecules. Shown here is an 
aquaporin tetramer, the biologically active form of the protein. (B) In 
this snapshot, taken from a real-time, molecular dynamics simulation, 
four columns of water molecules can be seen passing though the 
pores of an aquaporin tetramer (not shown). the space where the

Figure 12–7 Cells use different tactics to 
avoid osmotic swelling. (a) a fresh water 
amoeba avoids swelling by periodically 
ejecting the water that moves into the cell 
and accumulates in contractile vacuoles. 
the contractile vacuole first accumulates 
solutes, which cause water to follow by 
osmosis; it then pumps most of the solutes 
back into the cytosol before emptying its 
contents at the cell surface. (B) the plant

cells  have  a  gel-like  cytoplasm  (see  Figure  1–25)  that  resists  osmotic 
swelling.  Some  fresh  water  protozoans,  such  as  amoebae,  eliminate 
excess water using contractile vacuoles that periodically discharge their 
contents to the exterior (Figure 12–7A). Plant cells are prevented from 
swelling  by  their  tough  cell  walls  and  so  can  tolerate  a  large  osmotic 
difference across their plasma membrane (Figure 12–7b); indeed, plant 
cells make use of osmotic swelling pressure, or turgor pressure, to keep 
ECB4 E12.13/12.13
their cell walls tense, so that the stems of the plant are rigid and its leaves 
are extended. If turgor pressure is lost, plants wilt.

TrAnsporTers And Their funcTions
Transporters are responsible for the movement of most small, water-sol-
uble, organic molecules and some inorganic ions across cell membranes. 
Each  transporter  is  highly  selective,  often  transferring  just  one  type  of 
molecule. To guide and propel the complex traffic of solutes into and out 
of the cell, and between the cytosol and the different membrane-enclosed 
organelles, each cell membrane contains a characteristic set of different 
transporters appropriate to that particular membrane. For example, the 
plasma  membrane  contains  transporters  that  import  nutrients  such  as 
sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides; the lysosome membrane contains 
an  H+  transporter  that  imports  H+  to  acidify  the  lysosome  interior  and 
other transporters that move digestion products out of the lysosome into 
the cytosol; the inner membrane of mitochondria contains transporters 
for  importing  the  pyruvate  that  mitochondria  use  as  fuel  for  generat-
ing ATP, as well as transporters for exporting ATP once it is synthesized 
(Figure 12–8).

In this section, we describe the general principles that govern the function 
of transporters, and we present a more detailed view of the molecular 
mechanisms that drive the movement of a few key solutes.

passive Transporters move a solute Along its 
electrochemical gradient
An important example of a transporter that mediates passive transport 
is the glucose transporter in the plasma membrane of many mammalian 
cell types. The protein, which consists of a polypeptide chain that crosses 
the membrane at least 12 times, can adopt several conformations—and 
it switches reversibly and randomly between them. In one conformation, 
the  transporter  exposes  binding  sites  for  glucose  to  the  exterior  of  the 
cell; in another, it exposes the sites to the cell interior. 

Because  glucose  is  uncharged,  the  chemical  component  of  its  electro-
chemical gradient is zero. Thus the direction in which it is transported is 
determined by its concentration gradient alone. When glucose is plenti-
ful outside cells, as it is after a meal, the sugar binds to the transporter’s 
externally displayed binding sites; when the protein switches conforma-
tion—spontaneously and at random—it carries the bound sugar inward 
and releases it into the cytosol, where the glucose concentration is low 
(Figure  12–9).  Conversely,  when  blood  glucose  levels  are  low  as  they 
are when you are hungry—the hormone glucagon stimulates liver cells 
to produce large amounts of glucose by the breakdown of glycogen. As 
a result, the glucose concentration is higher inside liver cells than out-
side. This glucose binds to the internally displayed binding sites on the 
transporter.  When  the  protein  switches  conformation  in  the  opposite 
direction,  the  glucose  is  transported  out  of  the  cells,  where  it  is  made 
available for others to import. The net flow of glucose can thus go either 
way,  according  to  the  direction  of  the  glucose  concentration  gradient 
across  the  plasma  membrane:  inward  if  glucose  is  more  concentrated 
outside the cell than inside, and outward if the opposite is true.

Although passive transporters of this type play no part in determining the 
direction of transport, they are highly selective. For example, the binding 
sites  in  the  glucose  transporter  bind  only  d-glucose  and  not  its  mirror 
image, l-glucose, which the cell cannot use for glycolysis.

pumps Actively Transport a solute Against its 
electrochemical gradient
Cells cannot rely solely on passive transport. An active transport of sol-
utes against their electrochemical gradient is essential to maintain the 
appropriate intracellular ionic composition of cells and to import solutes 
that are at a lower concentration outside the cell than inside. For these 
purposes, cells depend on transmembrane pumps, which can carry out

Figure 12–9 Conformational changes in a transporter mediate the passive transport of a solute such as glucose. the transporter 
is shown in three conformational states: in the outward–open state (left), the binding sites for solute are exposed on the outside; in 
the inward–open state (right), the sites are exposed on the inside of the bilayer, and in the occluded state (center), the sites are not 
accessible from either side. the transition between the states occurs randomly, is completely reversible, and—most importantly for 
the function of the transporter shown—does not depend on whether the solute-binding site is occupied. therefore, if the solute 
concentration is higher on the outside of the bilayer, more solute will bind to the transporter in the outward–open conformation than in 
the inward–open conformation, and there will be a net transport of glucose down its concentration gradient.

active transport in three main ways (Figure 12–10): (i) ATP-driven pumps 
hydrolyze ATP to drive uphill transport. (ii) Coupled pumps link the uphill 
transport  of  one  solute  across  a  membrane  to  the  downhill  transport 
of another. (iii) Light-driven pumps, which are found mainly in bacterial 
cells, use energy derived from sunlight to drive uphill transport, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 11 for bacteriorhodopsin (see Figure 11–27).

ECB4 e12.08/12.08

The  different  forms  of  active  transport  are  often  linked.  Thus,  in  the 
plasma membrane of an animal cell, an ATP-driven Na+ pump transports 
Na+ out of the cell against its electrochemical gradient; this Na+ can then 
flow  back  into  the  cell,  down  its  electrochemical  gradient.  As  the  ion 
flows back in through various Na+-coupled pumps, the influx of Na+ pro-
vides the energy for the active transport of many other substances into 
the cell against their electrochemical gradients. If the Na+ pump ceased 
operating, the Na+ gradient would soon run down, and transport through 
Na+-coupled pumps would come to a halt. For this reason, the ATP-driven 
Na+ pump has a central role in the active transport of small molecules 
across the plasma membrane of animal cells. Plant cells, fungi, and many 
bacteria, use ATP-driven H+ pumps in an analogous way: in pumping H+ 
out of the cell, these proteins create an electrochemical gradient of H+ 
across the plasma membrane that is subsequently harnessed for solute 
transport, as we discuss later.

The na+ pump in Animal cells uses energy supplied by 
ATp to expel na+ and bring in K+
The ATP-driven Na+ pump plays such a central part in the energy econ-
omy of animal cells, that it typically accounts for 30% or more of their 
total  ATP  consumption.  This  pump  uses  the  energy  derived  from  ATP 
hydrolysis to transport Na+ out of the cell as it carries K+ in. The pump is 
therefore also known as the Na+-K+ ATPase or the Na+-K+ pump.
The  energy  from  ATP  hydrolysis  induces  a  series  of  protein  conforma-
tional changes that drive the Na+/K+ ion exchange. As part of the process, 
the  phosphate  group  removed  from  ATP  gets  transferred  to  the  pump 
itself (Figure 12–11). 
The ion transport (Na+ out, K+ in) involves a reaction cycle, in which each 
step depends on the one before. If any of the individual steps is prevented 
from occurring, the entire cycle halts. The toxin, ouabain, for example, 
inhibits the pump by preventing the binding of extracellular K+, arresting 
the cycle. The process is very efficient: the whole cycle takes only 10 mil-
liseconds. Furthermore, the tight coupling between steps in the pumping 
cycle ensures that the pump operates only when the appropriate ions are 
available to be transported, thereby avoiding useless ATP hydrolysis.

Figure 12–11 The na+ pump uses the 
energy of ATp hydrolysis to pump na+ 
out of animal cells and K+ in. In this 
way, the pump helps keep the cytosolic 
concentrations of Na+ low and K+ high 
(Movie 12.2).

The na+ pump generates a steep concentration gradient 
of na+ Across the plasma membrane
The  Na+  pump  functions  like  a  bilge  pump  in  a  leaky  ship,  ceaselessly 
expeling the Na+ that is constantly entering the cell through other trans-
porters and ion channels in the plasma membrane. In this way, the pump 
keeps the Na+ concentration in the cytosol about 10–30 times lower than 
in  the  extracellular  fluid  and  the  K+  concentration  about  10–30  times 
higher (see Table 12–1, p. 385). 
The  steep  concentration  gradient  of  Na+  across  the  plasma  membrane 
acts together with the membrane potential to create a large Na+ electro-
chemical gradient, which tends to pull Na+ back into the cell (see Figure 
12–5A). This high concentration of Na+ outside the cell, on the uphill side 
of its electrochemical gradient, is like a large volume of water behind a 
high dam: it represents a very large store of energy (Figure 12–12). Even 
if one artificially halts the operation of the Na+ pump with ouabain, this 
stored energy is sufficient to sustain for many minutes the various pumps 
in  the  plasma  membrane  that  are  driven  by  the  downhill  flow  of  Na+, 
which we discuss shortly.

ECB4 e12.09/12.09

ca2+ pumps Keep the cytosolic ca2+ concentration low 
Ca2+,  like  Na+,  is  also  kept  at  a  low  concentration  in  the  cytosol  com-
pared with its concentration in the extracellular fluid, but it is much less 
plentiful  than  Na+,  both  inside  and  outside  cells  (see  Table  12–1).  The 
movement of Ca2+ across cell membranes is nonetheless crucial, because 
Ca2+  can  bind  tightly  to  a  variety  of  proteins  in  the  cell,  altering  their 
activities. An influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol through Ca2+ channels, for 
example,  is  used  by  different  cells  as  an  intracellular  signal  to  trigger 
various cell processes, such as muscle contraction (discussed in Chapter 
17), fertilization (discussed in Chapters 16 and 19), and nerve cell com-
munication, discussed later. 
The lower the background concentration of free Ca2+ in the cytosol, the 
more sensitive the cell is to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Thus eukaryotic 
cells in general maintain a very low concentration of free Ca2+ in their 
cytosol (about 10–4 mM) in the face of a very much higher extracellular 
Ca2+  concentration  (typically  1–2  mM).  This  huge  concentration  differ-
ence  is  achieved  mainly  by  means  of  ATP-driven  Ca2+  pumps  in  both 
the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which 
actively pump Ca2+ out of the cytosol.
Ca2+  pumps  are  ATPases  that  work  in  much  the  same  way  as  the  Na+ 
pump depicted in Figure 12–11. The main difference is that Ca2+ pumps

can be used to drive active processes in a 
cell, including the active transport of other 
molecules across the plasma membrane.

coupled pumps exploit solute gradients to mediate 
Active Transport
A  gradient  of  any  solute  across  a  membrane,  like  the  electrochemical 
Na+ gradient generated by the Na+ pump, can be used to drive the active 
transport of a second molecule. The downhill movement of the first sol-
ute down its gradient provides the energy to power the uphill transport 
of the second. The active transporters that work in this way are called  
coupled pumps (see Figure 12–10). They can couple the movement of 
one inorganic ion to that of another, the movement of an inorganic ion to 
that of a small organic molecule, or the movement of one small organic 
molecule to that of another. If the pump moves both solutes in the same 
direction across the membrane, it is called a symport. If it moves them in 
opposite directions, it is called an antiport. A transporter that ferries only 
one type of solute across the membrane (and is therefore not a coupled 
transporter) is called a uniport (Figure 12–14). The passive glucose trans-
porter described earlier (see Figure 12–9) is an example of a uniport.

The electrochemical na+ gradient drives coupled pumps 
in the plasma membrane of Animal cells
Symports that make use of the inward flow of Na+ down its steep electro-
chemical gradient have an especially important role in driving the import 
of other solutes into animal cells. The epithelial cells that line the gut, 
for  example,  pump  glucose  from  the  gut  lumen  across  the  gut  epithe-
lium and, ultimately, into the blood. If these cells had only the passive 
glucose uniport just mentioned, they would release glucose into the gut

Figure 12–13 The Ca2+ pump in the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum was the first 
ATp-driven ion pump to have its three-
dimensional structure determined by 
X-ray crystallography. When a muscle 
cell is stimulated, ca2+ floods into the 
cytosol from the sarcoplasmic reticulum—a 
specialized form of endoplasmic reticulum. 
the influx of ca2+ stimulates the cell to 
contract; to recover from the contraction, 
ca2+ must be pumped back into the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum by this ca2+ pump. 
   the ca2+ pump uses atp to 
phosphorylate itself, inducing a series 
of conformational changes that—when 
the pump is open to the lumen of the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum—eliminate the ca2+-
binding sites, ejecting the two ca2+ ions 
into the organelle.  

Figure 12–14 Transporters can function 
as uniports, symports, or antiports. 
transporters that carry a single solute 
across the membrane are called uniports. 
transporters that move multiple solutes 
are called coupled transporters. In coupled 
transport, the solutes can be transferred 
either in the same direction, by symports, 
or in the opposite direction, by antiports 
(Movie 12.3). Uniports, symports, and 
antiports can be used for either passive 
or active transport. Some coupled 
transporters, for example, act as pumps, 
coupling the uphill transport of one solute 
to the downhill transport of another.

after  fasting  as  freely  as  they  take  it  up  from  the  gut  after  a  feast  (see 
Figure 12–9). But these epithelial cells also possess a glucose–Na+ sym-
port,  which  they  can  use  to  take  up  glucose  from  the  gut  lumen,  even 
when the concentration of glucose is higher in the cell’s cytosol than it is 
in the gut lumen. Because the electrochemical gradient for Na+ is steep, 
when Na+ moves into the cell down its gradient, glucose is, in a sense, 
“dragged” into the cell with it. Because the binding of Na+ and glucose 
is cooperative—the binding of one enhances the binding of the other—if 
one of the two solutes is missing, the other fails to bind; therefore both 
molecules must be present for coupled transport to occur (Figure 12–15).

If the gut epithelial cells had only this symport, however, they could never 
release glucose for use by the other cells of the body. These cells, there-
fore, have two types of glucose transporters located at opposite ends of 
the cell. In the apical domain of the plasma membrane, which faces the 
gut lumen, they have the glucose–Na+ symports. These take up glucose 
actively, creating a high glucose concentration in the cytosol. In the basal 
and  lateral  domains  of  the  plasma  membrane,  the  cells  have  the  pas-
sive glucose uniports, which release the glucose down its concentration 
gradient for use by other tissues (Figure 12–16). As shown in the figure, 
the two types of glucose transporters are kept segregated in their proper 
domains of the plasma membrane by a diffusion barrier formed by a tight 
junction around the apex of the cell. This prevents mixing of membrane 
components between the two domains, as discussed in Chapter 11 (see 
Figure 11–32). 

Cells in the lining of the gut and in many other organs, including the kid-
ney, contain a variety of active symports in their plasma membrane that 
are similarly driven by the electrochemical gradient of Na+; each of these 
coupled  pumps  specifically  imports  a  small  group  of  related  sugars  or 
amino acids into the cell. But Na+-driven pumps that operate as antiports 
are  also  important  for  cells.  For  example,  the  Na+–H+  exchanger  in  the

states, the pump can transition between them only through an “occluded” state. For their symport, the occluded state can only be 
reached when both glucose and Na+ are bound (“occluded-occupied”) or when neither is bound (“occluded-empty”). Because the Na+ 
concentration is high in the extracellular space, the Na+ binding site is readily occupied in the outward-open state, and the transporter 
will have to wait for a rare glucose molecule to bind. When that happens, the pump flips to the occluded-occupied state, trapping both 
solutes. 
   Because conformational transitions are reversible, one of two things can happen: the transporter could flip back to the outward-open 
state. In this case, the solutes would dissociate, and nothing would be gained. alternatively, it could flip into the inward-open state, 
exposing the solute binding sites to the cytosol where the Na+ concentration is very low. thus sodium readily dissociates and then 
is pumped back out of the cell by the Na+ pump (shown in Figure 12–11) to maintain the steep Na+ gradient. the transporter is now 
trapped with a partially occupied binding site until the glucose molecule also dissociates. at this point, with no solute bound, it can 
transition into the “occluded-empty” state and from there back to the outward-open state to repeat the transport cycle.

plasma membranes of many animal cells uses the downhill influx of Na+ 
to pump H+ out of the cell; it is one of the main devices that animal cells 
use to control the pH in their cytosol—preventing the cell interior from 
becoming too acidic.

electrochemical h+ gradients drive coupled pumps in 
plants, fungi, and bacteria
Plant cells, bacteria, and fungi (including yeasts) do not have Na+ pumps 
in their plasma membrane. Instead of an electrochemical Na+ gradient, 
they rely mainly on an electrochemical gradient of H+ to import solutes 
into the cell. The gradient is created by H+ pumps in the plasma mem-
brane that pump H+ out of the cell, thus setting up an electrochemical 
proton  gradient  across  this  membrane  and  creating  an  acid  pH  in  the 
medium  surrounding  the  cell.  The  import  of  many  sugars  and  amino 
acids into bacterial cells is then mediated by H+ symports, which use the 
electrochemical H+ gradient in much the same way that animal cells use 
the electrochemical Na+ gradient to import these nutrients. 
In some photosynthetic bacteria, the H+ gradient is created by the activity 
of light-driven H+ pumps such as bacteriorhodopsin (see Figure 11–27). 
In other bacteria, fungi, and plants, the H+ gradient is generated by H+ 
pumps in the plasma membrane that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis 
to pump H+ out of the cell; these H+ pumps resemble the Na+ pumps and 
Ca2+ pumps in animal cells discussed earlier.
A different type of ATP-dependent H+ pump is found in the membranes 
of some intracellular organelles, such as the lysosomes of animal cells 
and the central vacuole of plant and fungal cells. These pumps—which 
resemble the turbine-like enzyme that synthesizes ATP in mitochondria 
and  chloroplasts  (discussed  in  Chapter  14)—actively  transport  H+  out 
of the cytosol into the organelle, thereby helping to keep the pH of the 

transporters and their Functions

A rise in the intracellular ca2+ 
concentration causes muscle cells 
to contract. in addition to an ATp-
driven ca2+ pump, muscle cells 
that contract quickly and regularly, 
such as those of the heart, have an 
additional type of ca2+ pump—an 
antiport that exchanges ca2+ for 
extracellular na+ across the plasma 
membrane. The majority of the 
ca2+ ions that have entered the 
cell during contraction are rapidly 
pumped back out of the cell by 
this antiport, thus allowing the 
cell to relax. ouabain and digitalis 
are used for treating patients with 
heart disease because they make 
heart muscle cells contract more 
strongly. both drugs function by 
partially inhibiting the na+ pump in 
the plasma membrane of these cells. 
can you propose an explanation

In principle, the simplest way to allow a small water-soluble molecule to 
cross from one side of a membrane to the other is to create a hydrophilic 
channel  through  which  the  molecule  can  pass.  Channel  proteins,  or  
channels, perform this function in cell membranes, forming transmem-
brane  pores  that  allow  the  passive  movement  of  small  water-soluble 
molecules into or out of the cell or organelle.

A  few  channels  form  relatively  large,  aqueous  pores:  examples  are 
the  proteins  that  form  gap  junctions  between  two  adjacent  cells  (see 
Figure  20–29)  and  the  porins  that  form  pores  in  the  outer  membrane 
of  mitochondria  and  some  bacteria  (see  Figure  11–24).  But  such  large, 
permissive channels would lead to disastrous leaks if they directly con-
nected the cytosol of a cell to the extracellular space. Thus most of the 
channels in the plasma membrane form narrow, highly selective pores. 
The aquaporins discussed earlier, for example, facilitate the flow of water 
across the plasma membrane of some prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 
These pores are structured in such a way that they allow the passive dif-
fusion of uncharged water molecules, while prohibiting the movement of 
ions, including even the smallest ion, H+. 
The  bulk  of  a  cell’s  channels  facilitate  the  passage  of  select  inorganic 
ions. It is these ion channels we discuss in this section.

ion channels Are ion-selective and gated
Two important properties distinguish ion channels from simple holes in 
the membrane. First, they show ion selectivity, permitting some inorganic 
ions to pass but not others. Ion selectivity depends on the diameter and 
shape of the ion channel and on the distribution of the charged amino 
acids that line it. Each ion in aqueous solution is surrounded by a small 
shell of water molecules, most of which have to be shed for the ions to 
pass, in single file, through the selectivity filter in the narrowest part of 
the channel (Figure 12–18). An ion channel is narrow enough in places 
to force ions into contact with the channel wall so that only those ions of 
appropriate size and charge are able to pass (Movie 12.5). 

The second important distinction between simple holes and ion channels 
is that ion channels are not continuously open. Ion transport would be of 
no value to the cell if the many thousands of ion channels in a cell mem-
brane were open all the time and there were no means of controlling the 
flow of ions through them. Instead, ion channels open only briefly and 
then close again (Figure 12–19). As we discuss later, most ion channels 
are gated: a specific stimulus triggers them to switch between a closed 
and an open state by a change in their conformation.

Unlike  a  transporter,  an  open  ion  channel  does  not  need  to  undergo 
conformational  changes  with  each  ion  it  passes,  and  so  it  has  a  large 
advantage  over  a  transporter  with  respect  to  its  maximum  rate  of

QuesTion 12–3

A transmembrane protein has the 
following properties: it has two 
binding sites, one for solute A and 
one for solute b. The protein can 
undergo a conformational change 
to switch between two states: either 
both binding sites are exposed 
exclusively on one side of the 
membrane or both binding sites 
are exposed exclusively on the 
other side of the membrane. The 
protein can switch between the two 
conformational states only if both 
binding sites are occupied or if both 
binding sites are empty, but cannot 
switch if only one binding site is 
occupied. 
A.  What kind of protein do these 
properties define?
b.  do you need to specify any 
additional properties to turn this 
protein into a symport that couples 
the movement of solute A up its 
concentration gradient to the 
movement of solute b down its 
electrochemical gradient?
c.  Write a set of rules that defines 
an antiport.

Figure 12–18 An ion channel has a 
selectivity filter that controls which 
inorganic ions it will allow to cross the 
membrane. Shown here is a portion of 
a bacterial K+ channel. One of the four 
protein subunits has been omitted from 
the drawing to expose the interior structure 
of the pore (blue). From the cytosolic side, 
the pore opens into a vestibule that sits 
in the middle of the membrane. K+ ions 
in the vestibule are still partially cloaked 
in their associated water molecules. the 
narrow selectivity filter, which connects 
the vestibule with the outside of the cell, 
is lined with polar groups (not shown) that 
form transient binding sites for the K+ ions 
once the ions have shed their water shell. to 
observe this selectivity in action, see movie

forms a hydrophilic pore across the lipid bilayer only in the “open” 
conformation. as illustrated in Figure 12–18, the pore narrows to 
atomic dimensions in the selectivity filter, where the ion selectivity of 
the channel is largely determined.

transport. More than a million ions can pass through an open channel 
each second, which is 1000 times greater than the fastest rate of transfer 
known for any transporter. On the other hand, channels cannot couple 
the ion flow to an energy source to carry out active transport: most simply 
make  the  membrane  transiently  permeable  to  selected  inorganic  ions, 
mainly Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Cl–. 
Thanks  to  active  transport  by  pumps,  the  concentrations  of  most  ions 
are far from equilibrium across a cell membrane. When an ion channel 
opens, therefore, ions usually flow through it, moving rapidly down their 
electrochemical gradients. This rapid shift of ions changes the membrane 
potential, as we discuss next. 

membrane potential is governed by the permeability of a 
membrane to specific ions
Changes  in  membrane  potential  are  the  basis  of  electrical  signaling  in 
many types of cells, whether they are the nerve or muscle cells in ani-
mals, or the touch-sensitive cells of a carnivorous plant (Figure 12–20). 
Such electrical changes are mediated by alterations in the permeability of 
membranes to ions. In an animal cell that is in an unstimulated, or “rest-
ing,” state, the negative charges on the organic molecules inside the cell 
are largely balanced by K+, the predominant intracellular ion (see Table 
12–1). K+ is actively imported into the cell by the Na+ pump, which gener-
ates a K+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane, 
however, also contains a set of K+ channels known as K+ leak channels. 
These channels randomly flicker between open and closed states no mat-
ter what the conditions are inside or outside the cell; when they are open, 
they  allow  K+  to  move  freely.  In  a  resting  cell,  these  are  the  main  ion 
channels open in the plasma membrane, rendering the membrane much 
more permeable to K+ than to other ions.
When the channels are open, K+ has a tendency to flow out of the cell 
down  its  steep  concentration  gradient.  This  transfer  of  K+  across  the 
plasma  membrane  leaves  behind  unbalanced  negative  charges  on  the 
other side, creating a voltage difference, or membrane potential (Figure 
12–21).  Because  this  charge  imbalance  will  oppose  any  further  move-
ment of K+ out of the cell, an equilibrium condition is established in which 
the membrane potential keeping K+ inside the cell is just strong enough 
to counteract the tendency of K+ to move down its concentration gradient 
and out of the cell. In this state of equilibrium, the electrochemical gradi-
ent for K+ is zero, even though there is still a much higher concentration 
of K+ inside the cell than out (Figure 12–22). 
The  membrane  potential  in  such  steady-state  conditions—in  which 
the  flow  of  positive  and  negative  ions  across  the  plasma  membrane  is 

Figure 12–20 A venus flytrap uses electrical signaling to capture 
its prey. the leaves snap shut in less than half a second when an 
insect moves on them. the response is triggered by touching any two 
of the three trigger hairs in succession in the center of each leaf. this 
mechanical stimulation opens ion channels in the plasma membrane 
and thereby sets off an electrical signal, which, by an unknown 
mechanism, leads to a rapid change in turgor pressure that closes the 
leaf. (courtesy of Gabor Izso, Getty Images.) 

Ion channels and the Membrane potential         

399

Figure 12–21 The distribution of ions 
on either side of a cell membrane gives 
rise to its membrane potential. the 
membrane potential results from a thin  
(<1 nm) layer of ions close to the 
membrane, held in place by their electrical 
attraction to oppositely charged ions on 
the other side of the membrane. (a) When 
there is an exact balance of charges on 
either side of the membrane, there is no 
membrane potential. (B) When ions of one 
type cross the membrane, they set up a 
charge difference between the two sides 
of the membrane that creates a membrane 
potential. the number of ions that must 
move across the membrane to set up a 
membrane potential is a tiny fraction of  
all those present on either side. In the case 
of the plasma membrane in animal cells,  
for example, 6000 K+ ions crossing 
1 μm2 of membrane are enough to shift 
the membrane potential by about 100 mV; 
the number of K+ ions in 1 μm3 of cytosol is 
70,000 times larger than this.

simple  formula  called  the  Nernst  equation  expresses  this  equilibrium 
quantitatively and makes it possible to calculate the theoretical resting 
membrane potential if the ion concentrations on either side of the mem-
brane are known (Figure 12–23). In animal cells, the resting membrane 
potential—which varies between –20 to –200 mV—is chiefly a reflection of 
the electrochemical K+ gradient across the plasma membrane, because, 
at rest, the plasma membrane is chiefly permeable to K+, and K+ is the 
main positive ion inside the cell.

Figure 12–22 The K+ concentration gradient and K+ leak channels play major parts in generating the resting membrane 
potential across the plasma membrane in animal cells. (a) a hypothetical situation in which the K+ leak channels are closed, and the 
membrane potential is zero. (B) as soon as the channels open, K+ will tend to leave the cell, moving down its concentration gradient. 
assuming the membrane contains no open channels permeable to other ions, K+ will cross the membrane, but negative ions will 
be unable to follow. the resulting charge imbalance gives rise to a membrane potential that tends to drive K+ back into the cell. at 
equilibrium, the effect of the K+ concentration gradient is exactly balanced by the effect of the membrane potential, and there is no net 
movement of K+ across the membrane.
   the Na+ pump also contributes to the resting potential—both by helping to establish the K+ gradient and by pumping 3 Na+ ions 
out of the cell for every 2 K+ ions it pumps in (see Figure 12–11), thereby helping to keep the inside of the cell more negative than the 
outside (not shown here).

ChApTer 12     transport across cell Membranes

The force tending to drive an ion across a 
membrane is made up of two components: 
one due to the electrical membrane 
potential and one due to the concentration 
gradient of the ion. At equilibrium, the two 
forces are balanced and satisfy a simple 
mathematical relationship given by the

Nernst equation

V = 62 log10 (Co /Ci)

where V is the membrane potential in 
millivolts, and Co and Ci are the outside and 
inside concentrations of the ion, respectively. 
This form of the equation assumes that the 
ion carries a single positive charge and that the 
temperature is 37°C.

Figure 12–24 patch-clamp recording is 
used to monitor ion channel activity. First, 
a microelectrode is made by heating a glass 
tube and pulling it to create an extremely 
fine tip with a diameter of no more than a 
few micrometers; the tube is then filled with 
an aqueous conducting solution, and the  
tip is pressed against the cell surface.  
(a) With gentle suction, a tight electrical 
seal is formed where the cell membrane 
contacts the mouth of the microelectrode. 
Because of the extremely tight seal, current 
can enter or leave the microelectrode 
only by passing through the ion channel 
or channels in the patch of membrane 
covering its tip. (B) to expose the cytosolic 
face of the membrane, the patch of 
membrane held in the microelectrode can 
be torn from the cell. the advantage of 
the detached patch is that it is easy to alter 
the composition of the solution on either 
side of the membrane to test the effect of 
various solutes on channel behavior. (c) a 
micrograph showing an isolated nerve cell 
held in a suction pipette (the tip of which is 
shown on the left), while a microelectrode 
is being used for patch-clamp recording. 
(D) the circuitry for patch-clamp recording. 
at the open end of the microelectrode, a 
metal wire is inserted. current that enters 
the microelectrode through ion channels in 
the small patch of membrane covering its 
tip passes via the wire, through measuring 
instruments, back into the bath of medium 
surrounding the cell or the detached patch.

Figure 12–23 The nernst equation can be used to calculate the 
resting potential of a membrane. the relevant ion concentrations are 
those on either side of the membrane. From this equation, we see that 
each tenfold change in the ion concentration ratio (Co/Ci) alters the 
membrane potential by 62 millivolts.

ions enter or leave the cell depends on the direction of their electrochem-
ical gradients. Thus the membrane potential at any time depends on both 
the state of the membrane’s ion channels and the ion concentrations on 
either side of the plasma membrane. Bulk changes in ion concentrations 
cannot  occur  quickly  enough  to  drive  the  rapid  changes  in  membrane 
potential  that  are  associated  with  electrical  signaling.  Instead,  it  is  the 
rapid opening and closing of ion channels, which occurs within millisec-
onds, that matters most for this type of cell signaling.

ion channels randomly snap between open and closed 
states
Measuring changes in electrical current is the main method used to study 
ion  movements  and  ion  channels  in  living  cells.  Amazingly,  electrical 
recording techniques can detect and measure the electric current flowing 
through a single channel molecule. The procedure developed for doing 
this  is  known  as  patch-clamp  recording,  and  it  provides  a  direct  and 
surprising picture of how individual ion channels behave. 

In  patch-clamp  recording,  a  fine  glass  tube  is  used  as  a  microelectrode 
to  isolate  and  make  electrical  contact  with  a  small  area  of  the  mem-
brane at the surface of the cell (Figure 12–24). The technique makes it

possible to record the activity of ion channels in all sorts of cell types—
particularly in large nerve and muscle cells, which are famous for their 
electrical activities. By varying the concentrations of ions on either side 
of the patch, one can test which ions will go through the channels in the 
patch.  With  the  appropriate  electronic  circuitry,  the  voltage  across  the 
membrane patch—that is, the membrane potential—can also be set and 
held “clamped” at any chosen value (hence the term “patch-clamp”). The 
ability to expose the membrane to different voltages makes it possible to 
see how changes in membrane potential affect the opening and closing 
of the ion channels in the membrane.

With a sufficiently small area of membrane in the patch, sometimes only 
a single ion channel will be present. Modern electrical instruments are 
sensitive enough to reveal the ion flow through a single channel, detected 
as a minute electric current (of the order of 10–12 ampere or 1 picoam-
pere). Monitoring individual ion channels in this way revealed something 
surprising  about  the  way  they  behave:  even  when  conditions  are  held 
constant, the currents abruptly appear and disappear, as though an on/
off  switch  were  being  jiggled  randomly  (Figure  12–25).  This  behavior 
indicates that the channel has moving parts and is snapping back and 
forth between open and closed conformations (see Figure 12–19) as the 
channel is knocked from one conformation to the other by the random 
thermal  movements  of  the  molecules  in  its  environment.  Patch-clamp 
recording  was  the  first  technique  that  could  monitor  such  conforma-
tional changes, and the picture it paints—of a jerky piece of machinery 
subjected to constant external buffeting—is now known to apply also to 
other proteins with moving parts.

The activity of each ion channel is very much “all-or-none”: when an ion 
channel is open, it is fully open; when it is closed, it is fully closed. That 
raises a fundamental question: If ion channels randomly snap between 
open and closed conformations even when conditions on each side of 
the  membrane  are  held  constant,  how  can  their  state  be  regulated  by 
conditions inside or outside the cell? The answer is that, when the appro-
priate  conditions  change,  the  random  behavior  continues  but  with  a 
greatly changed bias: if the altered conditions tend to open the channel, 
for example, the channel will now spend a much greater proportion of its 
time in the open conformation, although it will not remain open continu-
ously (see Figure 12–25). 

different Types of stimuli influence the opening and 
closing of ion channels 
There  are  more  than  a  hundred  types  of  ion  channels,  and  even  sim-
ple  organisms  can  possess  many  different  types.  The  nematode  worm 
C. elegans, for example, has genes that encode 68 different but related 
K+ channels alone. Ion channels differ from one another primarily with

Figure 12–25 The behavior of a single 
ion channel can be observed using the 
patch-clamp technique. the voltage (the 
membrane potential) across the isolated 
patch of membrane is held constant 
during the recording. In this example, the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine is present, 
and the membrane patch from a muscle 
cell contains a single channel protein that 
is responsive to acetylcholine (discussed 
later, see Figure 12–41). as seen, this 
ion channel opens to allow passage of 
positive ions when acetylcholine binds to 
the exterior face of the channel. But even 
when acetylcholine is bound to the channel, 
as is the case during the three channel 
openings shown here, the channel does 
not remain open all the time. Instead, it 
flickers between open and closed states. 
Note that how long the channel remains 
open is variable. If acetylcholine were not 
present, the channel would only rarely open.

respect to their ion selectivity—the type of ions they allow to pass—and  
their gating—the conditions that influence their opening and closing. For 
a voltage-gated channel, the probability of being open is controlled by 
the membrane potential (Figure 12–26A). For a ligand-gated channel, 
opening  is  controlled  by  the  binding  of  some  molecule  (the  ligand)  to 
the  channel  (Figure  12–26b  and  C).  For  a  mechanically-gated  chan-
nel, opening is controlled by a mechanical force applied to the channel 
(Figure 12–26d). 
The auditory hair cells in the ear are an important example of cells that 
depend on mechanically-gated channels. Sound vibrations pull the chan-
nels open, causing ions to flow into the hair cells; this ion flow sets up 
an electrical signal that is transmitted from the hair cell to the auditory 
nerve, which conveys the signal to the brain (Figure 12–27).

enter from the surrounding fluid (Movie 12.6). the influx of ions activates the hair cells, which stimulate underlying nerve endings of the 
auditory nerve fibers that relay the auditory signal to the brain. 
   the hair-cell mechanism is astonishingly sensitive: the faintest sounds we can hear have been estimated to stretch the filaments  
by an average of about 0.04 nm, which is less than the diameter of a hydrogen ion (Movie 12.7).

voltage-gated ion channels respond to the membrane 
potential
Voltage-gated  ion  channels  play  a  major  role  in  propagating  electrical 
signals  along  all  nerve  cell  processes,  such  as  those  that  relay  signals 
from our brain to our toe muscles. But voltage-gated ion channels are 
present in many other cell types, too, including muscle cells, egg cells, 
protozoans,  and  even  plant  cells,  where  they  enable  electrical  signals 
to  travel  from  one  part  of  the  plant  to  another,  as  in  the  leaf-closing 
response of a Mimosa pudica plant (Figure 12–28). 
Voltage-gated  ion  channels  have  domains  called  voltage  sensors  that 
are extremely sensitive to changes in the membrane potential: changes 
above a certain threshold value exert sufficient electrical force on these 
domains to encourage the channel to switch from its closed to its open 
conformation.  As  discussed  earlier,  a  change  in  the  membrane  poten-
tial does not affect how wide the channel is open, but instead alters the 
probability  that  it  will  open  (see  Figure  12–25).  Thus,  in  a  large  patch 
of  membrane  containing  many  molecules  of  the  channel  protein,  one 
might find that on average 10% of them are open at any instant when the 
membrane is at one potential, whereas 90% are open after this potential 
changes.

When  one  type  of  voltage-gated  ion  channel  opens,  the  membrane 
potential of the cell can change. This in turn can activate or inactivate 
other voltage-gated ion channels. This control circuit, from ion channels 
→ membrane potential → ion channels, is fundamental to all electrical 
signaling  in  cells.  To  see  how  such  a  circuit  can  be  used  for  electrical 
signaling,  we  now  turn  to  nerve  cells:  they—more  than  any  other  cell 
type—have  made  a  profession  of  electrical  signaling,  and  they  employ 
ion channels in very sophisticated ways.

ion chAnnels And nerve cell signAling
The fundamental task of a nerve cell, or neuron, is to receive, integrate, 
and transmit signals. Neurons carry signals inward from sense organs, 
such as eyes and ears, to the central nervous system—the brain and spinal 
cord. In the central nervous system, neurons signal from one to another 
through networks of enormous complexity, allowing the brain and spinal 
cord to analyze, interpret, and respond to the signals coming in from the 
sense organs. 

Every neuron consists of a cell body, which contains the nucleus and has 
a number of long, thin extensions radiating outward from it. Usually, a 
neuron has one long extension called an axon, which conducts electrical 
signals away from the cell body toward distant target cells; it also usually 
has several shorter, branching extensions called dendrites, which radi-
ate from the cell body like antennae and provide an enlarged surface area 
to receive signals from the axons of other neurons (Figure 12–29). The

responses to touch. a few seconds after 
the leaf is touched, the leaflets snap shut. 
the response involves the opening of 
mechanically-gated ion channels in touch-
sensitive sensory cells, which then pass a 
signal to cells containing voltage-gated ion 
channels, generating an electric impulse. 
When the impulse reaches specialized hinge 
cells at the base of each leaflet, a rapid loss 
of water by these cells occurs, causing the 
leaflets to fold into a closed conformation 
suddenly and progressively down the leaf 
stalk.

terminal branches of axon

axon commonly divides at its far end into many branches, each of which 
ends in a nerve terminal, so that the neuron’s message can be passed 
simultaneously to many target cells—muscle or gland cells or other neu-
rons. Likewise, the branching of the dendrites can be extensive, in some 
cases, sufficient to receive as many as 100,000 inputs on a single neuron.

No matter what the meaning of the signal a neuron carries—whether it is 
visual information from the eye, a motor command to a muscle, or one 
step in a complex network of neural processing in the brain—the form 
of the signal is always the same: it consists of changes in the electrical 
potential across the neuron’s plasma membrane. 

ECB4 E12.31/12.31

Action potentials Allow rapid long-distance 
communication Along Axons
A  neuron  is  stimulated  by  a  signal—typically  from  another  neuron—
delivered to a localized site on its surface. This signal initiates a change 
in the membrane potential at that site. To transmit the signal onward, this 
local  change in membrane potential has to spread from this point, which 
is  usually  on  a  dendrite  or  the  cell  body,  to  the  axon  terminals,  which 
relay the signal to the next cells in the pathway—forming a neural circuit. 
The distances required can be substantial: a signal that leaves a motor 
neuron in your spinal cord may have to travel a meter or more before it 
reaches a muscle in your foot. 

The local change in membrane potential generated by a signal can spread 
passively along an axon or a dendrite to adjacent regions of the plasma 
membrane.  Such  a  passively  spread  signal,  however,  rapidly  becomes 
weaker with increasing distance from the source. Over short distances, 
this  weakening  is  unimportant.  But  for  long-distance  communication, 
such passive spread is inadequate. 

Neurons solve this long-distance communication problem by employing 
an  active  signaling  mechanism.  Here  a  local  electrical  stimulus  of  suf-
ficient strength triggers an explosion of electrical activity in the plasma 
membrane  that  propagates  rapidly  along  the  membrane  of  the  axon, 
continuously  renewing  itself  all  along  the  way.  This  traveling  wave  of 
electrical excitation, known as an action potential, or a nerve impulse, 
can carry a message, without the signal weakening, all the way from one 
end of a neuron to the other, at speeds of up to 100 meters per second.

The early research that established this mechanism of electrical signal-
ing along axons was done on the giant axon of the squid (Figure 12–30). 
This axon has such a large diameter that it is possible to record its elec-
trical activity from an electrode inserted directly into it (how we Know, 
pp. 406–407). From such studies, it was deduced how action potentials 

Ion channels and Nerve cell Signaling

are the direct consequence of the properties of voltage-gated ion chan-
nels in the axonal plasma membrane, as we now explain.

Action potentials Are mediated by voltage-gated cation 
channels
When  a  neuron  is  stimulated,  the  membrane  potential  of  the  plasma 
membrane  shifts  to  a  less  negative  value  (that  is,  toward  zero).  If  this 
depolarization  is  sufficiently  large,  it  will  cause  voltage-gated  Na+ 
channels in the membrane to open transiently at the site. As these chan-
nels flicker open, they allow a small amount of Na+ to enter the cell down 
its  steep  electrochemical  gradient.  The  influx  of  positive  charge  depo-
larizes the membrane further (that is, it makes the membrane potential 
even less negative), thereby opening additional voltage-gated Na+ chan-
nels  and  causing  still  further  depolarization.  This  process  continues  in 
an  explosive,  self-amplifying  fashion  until,  within  about  a  millisecond, 
the membrane potential in the local region of the neuron’s plasma mem-
brane has shifted from its resting value of about –60 mV to about +40 mV 
(Figure 12–31). 

The voltage of +40 mV is close to the membrane potential at which the 
electrochemical driving force for movement of Na+ across the membrane 
is zero—that is, at which the effects of the membrane potential and the 
concentration gradient for Na+ are equal and opposite, so that Na+ has no 
further tendency to enter or leave the cell. If the channels continued to 
respond to the altered membrane potential, the cell would get stuck with 
most of its voltage-gated Na+ channels open. 
The cell is saved from this fate because the Na+ channels have an auto-
matic  inactivating  mechanism—a  kind  of  “timer”  that  causes  them  to 
rapidly adopt (within a millisecond or so) a special inactivated confor-
mation,  in  which  the  channel  is  closed,  even  though  the  membrane  is 
still depolarized. The Na+ channels remain in this inactivated state until 
the  membrane  potential  has  returned  to  its  initial  negative  value.  A

a nervous system that is adept at 
responding rapidly to threats in the 
animal’s environment. among the nerve 
cells that make up this escape system is one 
that possesses a “giant axon,” with a very 
large diameter. Long before patch clamping 
allowed recordings from single ion channels 
in small cells (see Figure 12–24), the squid 
giant axon was routinely used to record and 
study action potentials.

Figure 12–31 An action potential is triggered by a depolarization of a neuron’s

a stimulus that depolarizes the plasma membrane to about –40 mV (the threshold 
potential) is sufficient to open voltage-gated Na+ channels in the membrane and 
thereby trigger an action potential. the membrane rapidly depolarizes further, and 
the membrane potential (red curve) swings past zero, reaching +40 mV before it 
returns to its resting negative value as the action potential terminates. the green

Each  spring,  Loligo  pealei  migrate  to  the  shallow 
waters off Cape Cod on the eastern coast of the United 
States.  There  they  spawn,  launching  the  next  genera-
tion of squid. But more than just meeting and breeding, 
these  animals  provide  neuroscientists  summering 
at  the  Marine  Biological  Laboratory  in  Woods  Hole, 
Massachusetts, with a golden opportunity to study the 
mechanism of electrical signaling along nerve axons. 

insert an electrode into it to measure the axon’s mem-
brane  potential  and  monitor  its  electrical  activity.  This 
experimental  system  allowed  researchers  to  address  a 
variety  of  questions,  including  which  ions  are  impor-
tant  for  establishing  the  resting  membrane  potential 
and  for  initiating  and  propagating  an  action  potential, 
and how changes in the membrane potential control ion 
permeability.

Like most animals, squid survive by catching prey and 
escaping predators. Fast reflexes and an ability to accel-
erate  rapidly  and  make  sudden  changes  in  swimming 
direction help them avoid danger while chasing down a 
decent meal. Squid derive their speed and agility from a 
specialized biological jet propulsion system: they draw 
water  into  their  mantle  cavity  and  then  contract  their 
muscular body wall to expel the collected water rapidly 
through  a  tubular  siphon,  thus  propelling  themselves 
through the water.

Controlling such quick and coordinated muscle contrac-
tion requires a nervous system that can convey signals 
with great speed down the length of the animal’s body. 
Indeed, Loligo pealei possesses some of the largest nerve 
cell axons found in nature. Squid giant axons can reach 
10 cm in length and are over 100 times the diameter of 
a  mammalian  axon—about  the  width  of  a  pencil  lead. 
Generally speaking, the larger the diameter of an axon, 
the more rapidly signals can travel along its length. 

In  the  1930s,  scientists  first  started  to  take  advantage 
of  the  squid  giant  axon  for  studying  the  electrophysi-
ology  of  the  nerve  cell.  Because  of  its  relatively  large 
size, an investigator can isolate an individual axon and 

setup for action
Because the squid axon is so long and wide, an electrode 
made from a glass capillary tube containing a conduct-
ing solution can be thrust down the axis of the isolated 
axon  so  that  its  tip  lies  deep  in  the  cytoplasm  (Figure 
12–32A).  This  setup  allowed  investigators  to  measure 
the voltage difference between the inside and the out-
side  of  the  axon—that  is,  the  membrane  potential—as 
an action potential sweeps past the tip of the electrode 
(Figure  12–32b).  The  action  potential  itself  was  trig-
gered by applying a brief electrical stimulus to one end 
of the axon. It didn’t matter which end was stimulated, 
as the action potential could travel in either direction; it 
also didn’t matter how big the stimulus was, as long as it 
exceeded a certain threshold (see Figure 12–31), indicat-
ing that an action potential is all or nothing.

Once  researchers  could  reliably  generate  and  meas-
ure an action potential, they could use the preparation 
to  answer  other  questions  about  membrane  excitabil-
ity.  For  example,  which  ions  are  critical  for  an  action 
potential?  The  three  most  plentiful  ions,  both  inside 
and outside an axon, are Na+, K+, and Cl–. Do they have

equal  importance  when  it  comes  to  the  action  poten-
tial?  Because  the  squid  axon  is  so  large  and  robust,  it 
was  possible  to  extrude  the  cytoplasm  from  the  axon 
like toothpaste from a tube (Figure 12–33A). The emp-
tied-out  axon  could  then  be  reinflated  by  perfusing  it 
with a pure solution of Na+, K+, or Cl–, (Figure 12–33b). 
Thus,  the  ions  inside  the  axon  and  in  the  bath  solu-
tion  (see  Figure  12–32)  could  be  varied  independently. 
In  this  way,  the  researchers  could  show  that  the  axon 
would  generate  a  normal  action  potential  if  and  only 
if  the  concentrations  of  Na+  and  K+  approximated  the 
natural concentrations found inside and outside the cell. 
Thus,  they  concluded  that  the  cell  components  crucial 
to the action potential are the plasma membrane, Na+ 
and K+ ions, and the energy provided by the concentra-
tion  gradients  of  these  ions  across  the  membrane;  all 
other components, including other sources of metabolic 
energy, were presumably removed by the perfusion.

channel traffic
Once Na+ and K+ had been singled out as critical for an 
action potential, the question then became: What does 
each  of  these  ions  contribute  to  the  action  potential? 
How permeable is the membrane to each, and how does 
the membrane permeability change as an action poten-
tial  sweeps  by?  Again,  the  squid  giant  axon  provided 
some answers. The concentrations of Na+ and K+ inside 
and outside the axon could be altered, and the effects 
of these changes on the membrane potential could be 
measured directly. From such studies, it was determined 
that, at rest, the membrane potential of an axon is close 
to  the  equilibrium  potential  for  K+:  when  the  external 
concentration of K+ was varied, the resting potential of 
the axon changed roughly in accordance with the Nernst 
equation (see Figure 12–23). They concluded that at rest, 
the membrane is chiefly permeable to K+; we now know 
that K+ leak channels provide the main pathway these 
ions can take through the resting plasma membrane.
The situation for Na+ is very different. When the external 
concentration of Na+ was varied, there was no effect on 
the resting potential of the axon. However, the height of 

the peak of the action potential varied with the concen-
tration of Na+ outside the axon (Figure 12–34). During 
the action potential, therefore, the membrane appeared 
to be chiefly permeable to Na+, presumably as the result 
of the opening of Na+ channels. In the aftermath of the 
action potential, the Na+ permeability decreased and the 
membrane potential reverted to a negative value, which 
depended  on  the  external  concentration  of  K+.  As  the 
membrane lost its permeability to Na+, it became even 
more permeable to K+ than before, presumably because 
additional  K+  channels  opened,  accelerating  the  reset-
ting of the membrane potential to the resting state, and 
readying the membrane for the next action potential.

These  studies  on  the  squid  giant  axon  made  an  enor-
mous  contribution  to  our  understanding  of  nerve  cell 
excitability, and the researchers who made these discov-
eries in the 1940s and 1950s—Alan Hodgkin and Andrew 
Huxley—received a Nobel Prize in 1963. However, it was 
years before the various ion channel proteins that they 
had hypothesized to exist would be biochemically iden-
tified. We now know the three-dimensional structures of 
many of these channel proteins, allowing us to marvel 
at the fundamental beauty of these molecular machines.

changing the channel’s conformation so the 
channel has a high probability of opening. 
But in the depolarized membrane, the

stable than the open conformation, and 
so, after a brief period spent in the open 
conformation, the channel becomes

schematic illustration of these three distinct states of the voltage-gated 
Na+  channel—closed,  open,  and  inactivated—is  shown  in  Figure  12–35. 
How they contribute to the rise and fall of an action potential is shown 
in Figure 12–36. 
During  an  action  potential,  Na+  channels  do  not  act  alone.  The  depo-
larized axonal membrane is helped to return to its resting potential by 
the  opening  of  voltage-gated  K+  channels.  These  also  open  in  response 
to  depolarization,  but  not  as  promptly  as  the  Na+  channels,  and  they 
stay  open  as  long  as  the  membrane  remains  depolarized.  As  the  local 
depolarization reaches its peak, K+ ions (carrying positive charge) there-
fore start to flow out of the cell through these newly opened K+ channels 
down their electrochemical gradient, temporarily unhindered by the neg-
ative membrane potential that normally restrains them in the resting cell. 
The  rapid  outflow  of  K+  through  the  voltage-gated  K+  channels  brings 
the membrane back to its resting state much more quickly than could be 
achieved by K+ outflow through the K+ leak channels alone.
Once  it  begins,  the  self-amplifying  depolarization  of  a  small  patch  of 
plasma  membrane  quickly  spreads  outward:  Na+  flowing  in  through 
open  Na+  channels  begins  to  depolarize  the  neighboring  region  of  the 
membrane, which then goes through the same self-amplifying cycle. In 
this way, an action potential spreads outward as a traveling wave from 
the initial site of depolarization, eventually reaching the axon terminals 
(Figure 12–37). 
Faced with the consequences of the Na+ and K+ fluxes caused by a pass-
ing  action  potential,  Na+  pumps  in  the  axon  plasma  membrane  labor

Figure 12–37 An action potential 
propagates along the length of an 
axon. the changes in the Na+ channels 
and the consequent flow of Na+ across 
the membrane (red arrows) alters the 
membrane potential and gives rise 
to the traveling action potential, as 
shown here and in Movie 12.8. the 
region of the axon with a depolarized 
membrane is shaded in blue. Note 
that an action potential can only travel 
forward from the site of depolarization. 
this is because Na+-channel 
inactivation in the aftermath of an 
action potential prevents the advancing 
front of depolarization from spreading 
backward (see also Figure 12–36).

voltage-gated ca2+ channels in nerve Terminals convert 
an electrical signal into a chemical signal 
When an action potential reaches the nerve terminals at the end of an 
axon,  the  signal  must  somehow  be  relayed  to  the  target  cells  that  the 
terminals contact—usually neurons or muscle cells. The signal is trans-
mitted  to  the  target  cells  at  specialized  junctions  known  as  synapses. 
At most synapses, the plasma membranes of the cells transmitting and 
receiving the message—the presynaptic and the postsynaptic cells, respec-
tively—are separated from each other by a narrow synaptic cleft (typically 
20 nm across), which the electrical signal cannot cross. To transmit the 
message across this gap, the electrical signal is converted into a chemi-
cal  signal,  in  the  form  of  a  small,  secreted  signal  molecule  known  as 
a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters are initially stored in the nerve 
terminals within membrane-enclosed synaptic vesicles (Figure 12–38). 

ECB4 e12.39/12.39

When an action potential reaches the nerve terminal, some of the synaptic 
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their neurotransmit-
ters  into  the  synaptic  cleft.  This  link  between  the  arrival  of  an  action 
potential and the secretion of neurotransmitter involves the activation of 
yet another type of voltage-gated cation channel. The depolarization of 
the nerve-terminal plasma membrane caused by the arrival of the action 
potential transiently opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which are con-
centrated  in  the  plasma  membrane  of  the  presynaptic  nerve  terminal. 
Because the Ca2+ concentration outside the terminal is more than 1000 
times greater than the free Ca2+ concentration in its cytosol (see Table 
12–1),  Ca2+  rushes  into  the  nerve  terminal  through  the  open  channels.

forming synapses on a single nerve cell 
dendrite (blue) in the mammalian brain. 
Neurotransmitters carry the signal across the 
synaptic cleft that separates the presynaptic 
and postsynaptic cell. the neurotransmitter 
in the presynaptic terminal is contained 
within synaptic vesicles, which release it 
into the synaptic cleft. Note that both the 
presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes 
are thickened and highly specialized at the 
synapse. (a, courtesy of cedric raine.)

Figure 12–39 An electrical signal is 
converted into a secreted chemical 
signal at a nerve terminal. When an action 
potential reaches a nerve terminal, it opens 
voltage-gated ca2+ channels in the plasma 
membrane, allowing ca2+ to flow into the 
terminal. the increased ca2+ in the nerve 
terminal stimulates the synaptic vesicles to 
fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing 
their neurotransmitter into the synaptic 
cleft—a process called exocytosis (discussed 
in chapter 15).

The resulting increase in Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol of the terminal 
immediately triggers the membrane fusion that releases the neurotrans-
mitter. Thanks to these voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the electrical signal 
has now been converted into a chemical signal that is secreted into the 
synaptic cleft (Figure 12–39). 

Transmitter-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic 
membrane convert the chemical signal back into an 
ECB4 e12.40/12.40
electrical signal
The released neurotransmitter rapidly diffuses across the synaptic cleft 
and binds to neurotransmitter receptors concentrated in the postsynaptic 
plasma membrane of the target cell. The binding of neurotransmitter to 
its receptors causes a change in the membrane potential of the target cell, 
which—if large enough—triggers the cell to fire an action potential. The 
neurotransmitter is then quickly removed from the synaptic cleft—either 
by enzymes that destroy it, by pumping it back into the nerve terminals 
that released it, or by uptake into neighboring non-neuronal cells. This 
rapid removal of the neurotransmitter limits the duration and spread of 
the  signal  and  ensures  that,  when  the  presynaptic  cell  falls  quiet,  the 
postsynaptic cell will do the same.

Neurotransmitter receptors can be of various types; some mediate rela-
tively slow effects in the target cell, whereas others trigger more rapid 
responses.  Rapid  responses—on  a  time  scale  of  milliseconds—depend 
on receptors that are transmitter-gated ion channels (also called ion-
channel-coupled receptors). These constitute a subclass of ligand-gated 
ion  channels  (see  Figure  12–26B),  and  their  function  is  to  convert  the 
chemical  signal  carried  by  a  neurotransmitter  back  into  an  electrical 
signal. The channels open transiently in response to the binding of the 
neurotransmitter, thus changing the ion permeability of the postsynap-
tic membrane. This in turn causes a change in the membrane potential 
(Figure 12–40). If the change is big enough, it will depolarize the postsy-
naptic membrane and trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. 

A  well-studied  example  of  a  transmitter-gated  ion  channel  is  found  at 
the neuromuscular junction—the specialized synapse formed between a 
motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell. In vertebrates, the neurotrans-
mitter here is acetylcholine, and the transmitter-gated ion channel is an 
acetylcholine receptor (Figure 12–41). But not all neurotransmitters excite 
the postsynaptic cell, as we consider next.

neurotransmitters can be excitatory or inhibitory 
Neurotransmitters can either excite or inhibit a postsynaptic cell, and it 
is the character of the receptor that recognizes the neurotransmitter that 
determines how the postsynaptic cell will respond. The chief receptors 
for  excitatory  neurotransmitters,  such  as  acetylcholine  and  glutamate, 
are ligand-gated cation channels. When a neurotransmitter binds, these 
channels open to allow an influx of Na+, which depolarizes the plasma 
membrane and thus tends to activate the postsynaptic cell, encouraging 
it to fire an action potential. By contrast, the main receptors for inhibitory 
neurotransmitters,  such  as  γ-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  and  glycine,  are 
ligand-gated Cl– channels. When neurotransmitters bind, these channels 
open, increasing the membrane permeability to Cl–; this change in per-
meability inhibits the postsynaptic cell by making its plasma membrane 
harder to depolarize. 

Toxins that bind to one of these excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmit-
ter receptors can have dramatic effects on humans. Curare, for example, 
causes  muscle  paralysis  by  blocking  excitatory  acetylcholine  receptors 
at the neuromuscular junction. This drug was used by South American

the resulting ion flows alter the membrane

electrical one (Movie 12.9).

Figure 12–41 The acetylcholine receptor in the plasma membrane of vertebrate skeletal muscle cells opens when it binds the

which (green) are identical. the subunits combine to form a transmitter-gated aqueous pore across the lipid bilayer. the pore is lined 
by five transmembrane α helices, one contributed by each subunit. there are two acetylcholine-binding sites, one formed by parts of 
a green and blue subunit, the other by parts of a green and orange subunit, as shown. (B) the closed conformation. the blue subunit 
has been removed here and in (c) to show the interior of the pore. Negatively charged amino acid side chains at either end of the pore

not bound and the channel is in its closed conformation, the pore is occluded (blocked) by hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the 
region called the gate. (c) the open conformation. When acetylcholine, released by a motor neuron, binds to both binding sites, the 
channel undergoes a conformational change; the hydrophobic side chains move apart and the gate opens, allowing Na+ to flow across 
the membrane down its electrochemical gradient, depolarizing the membrane. even with acetylcholine bound, the channel flickers 
randomly between the open and closed states (see Figure 12–25); without acetylcholine bound, it rarely opens.

When an inhibitory neurotransmitter 
such as gAbA opens cl– channels 
in the plasma membrane of a 
postsynaptic neuron, why does this 
make it harder for an excitatory 
neurotransmitter to excite the 
neuron?

most psychoactive drugs Affect synaptic signaling by 
binding to neurotransmitter receptors
Many drugs used in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and 
schizophrenia  act  by  binding  to  transmitter-gated  ion  channels  in  the 
brain. Sedatives and tranquilizers such as barbiturates, Valium, Ambien, 
and Restoril, for example, bind to GABA-gated Cl– channels. Their bind-
ing makes the channels easier to open by GABA, rendering the neuron 
more sensitive to GABA’s inhibitory action. By contrast, the antidepres-
sant Prozac blocks the Na+-driven symport responsible for the reuptake 
of  the  excitatory  neurotransmitter  serotonin,  increasing  the  amount  of 
serotonin available in the synapses that use it. This drug has changed the 
lives of many people who suffer from depression—although why boost-
ing serotonin can elevate mood is still unknown.

The number of distinct types of neurotransmitter receptors is very large, 
although they fall into a small number of families. There are, for example, 
many subtypes of acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, glycine, and serotonin 
receptors;  they  are  usually  located  on  different  neurons  and  often  dif-
fer only subtly in their electrophysiological properties. With such a large 
variety of receptors, it may be possible to design a new generation of psy-
choactive drugs that will act more selectively on specific sets of neurons 
to  mitigate  the  mental  illnesses  that  devastate  so  many  people’s  lives. 
One percent of the human population, for example, have schizophrenia, 
another  1%  have  bipolar  disorder,  about  1%  have  an  autistic  disorder, 
and many more suffer from anxiety or depressive disorders. Mutations 
in genes that affect synaptic function can greatly increase the risk of the 
most serious of these disorders. The fact that these disorders are so prev-
alent suggests that the complexity of synaptic signaling may make the 
brain especially vulnerable to genetic abnormalities. But complexity also 
provides some distinct advantages, as we discuss next.

The complexity of synaptic signaling enables us to Think, 
Act, learn, and remember
For  a  process  so  critical  for  animal  survival,  the  mechanism  that  gov-
erns  synaptic  signaling  seems  unnecessarily  cumbersome,  as  well  as 
error-prone. For a signal to pass from one neuron to the next, the nerve 
terminal  of  the  presynaptic  cell  must  convert  an  electrical  signal  into 
a secreted chemical. This chemical signal must then diffuse across the 
synaptic  cleft  so  that  a  postsynaptic  cell  can  convert  it  back  into  an 
electric one. Why would evolution have favored such an apparently inef-
ficient and vulnerable way to pass a signal between cells? It would seem 
more efficient and robust to have a direct electrical connection between 
them—or to do away with the synapse altogether and use a single con-
tinuous cell.

The  value  of  synapses  that  rely  on  secreted  chemical  signals  becomes 
clear when we consider how they function in the context of the nervous 
system—a  huge  network  of  neurons,  interconnected  by  many  branch-
ing  circuits,  performing  complex  computations,  storing  memories,  and 
generating plans for action. To carry out these functions, neurons have 
to do more than merely generate and relay signals: they must also com-
bine  them,  interpret  them,  and  record  them.  Chemical  synapses  make 
these activities possible. A motor neuron in the spinal cord, for example, 
receives inputs from hundreds or thousands of other neurons that make 
synapses on it (Figure 12–42). Some of these signals tend to stimulate 
the neuron, while others inhibit it. The motor neuron has to combine all 
of the information it receives and react, either by stimulating a muscle to 
contract or by remaining quiet.

This task of computing an appropriate output from a babble of inputs is 
achieved by a complicated interplay between different types of ion chan-
nels in the neuron’s plasma membrane. Each of the hundreds of types of 
neurons in your brain has its own characteristic set of receptors and ion 
channels that enables the cell to respond in a particular way to a certain 
set of inputs and thus to perform its specialized task. 

ECB4 E12.45/12.45

In addition to integrating a variety of chemical inputs, a synapse can also 
adjust the magnitude of its response—reacting more vigorously (or less 
vigorously) to an incoming action potential—based on how heavily that 
synapse has been used in the past. This ability to adapt, called synaptic 
plasticity, is triggered by the entry of Ca2+ through special cation chan-
nels in the postsynaptic plasma membrane, which can lead to functional 
alterations on either side of the synapse—in the amount of neurotrans-
mitter  released  from  the  axon  terminal,  the  way  the  postsynaptic  cell 
responds  to  the  transmitter,  or  both.  These  synaptic  changes  can  last 
hours, days, weeks, or longer, and they are thought to play an important 
part in learning and memory.

Synapses are thus critical components of the machinery that enables us 
to act, think, feel, speak, learn, and remember. Given that they operate in 
neuronal circuits that are so dauntingly complex, will it ever be possible 
to deeply understand the circuits that drive complex human behaviors? 
Although  cracking  this  problem  in  humans  is  still  far  in  the  future,  we 
now have increasingly powerful ways to study the neural circuits—and 
molecules—that underlie behavior in experimental animals. One of the 
most promising techniques makes use of a type of light-gated ion chan-
nel borrowed from unicellular algae, as we now discuss.

optogenetics uses light-gated ion channels to Transiently 
Activate or inactivate neurons in living Animals
Photosynthetic green algae use light-gated channels to sense and navigate 
toward sunlight. In response to blue light, one of these channels—called 
channelrhodopsin—allows Na+ to flow into the cell. This depolarizes the 
plasma membrane and, ultimately, modulates the beating of the flagella 
the  cell  uses  to  swim.  Although  these  channels  are  peculiar  to  unicel-
lular green algae, they continue to function properly even when they are 
artificially transferred into other cell types, thereby rendering those cells 
responsive to light.

Because  nerve  cells  are  activated  by  a  depolarizing  influx  of  Na+  (see 
Figure 12–36), channelrhodopsin can be used to manipulate the activity of 
neurons and neural circuits. It has even been used to control the behavior 
of living animals. In one particularly stunning experiment, the channel-
rhodopsin gene was introduced into a select subpopulation of neurons 
in the mouse hypothalamus—a brain region involved in many functions, 
including aggression. When the channels were subsequently illuminated 
by a thin, optic fiber implanted in the animal’s brain, the mouse launched 
an attack on any object in its path—including other mice or, in one comi-
cal instance, an inflated rubber glove. When the light was switched off, 
the neurons fell silent, and the mouse’s behavior immediately returned to 
normal (Figure 12–43 and Movie 12.10).

ECB4 n12.100/12.44

Because  the  approach  uses  light  to  control  neurons  into  which  chan-
nelrhodopsin—or any other light-gated channel—has been introduced by 
genetic  engineering  techniques  (discussed  in  Chapter  10),  the  method 
has been dubbed optogenetics. This new tool is revolutionizing neuro-
biology, allowing investigators to dissect the neural circuits that govern 
even the most complex behaviors in a variety of experimental animals, 
from fruit flies to monkeys. But its implications extend beyond the labora-
tory. As genetic studies continue to identify genes associated with various 
human neurological and psychiatric disorders, the ability to exploit light-
gated  ion  channels  to  study  where  and  how  these  genes  function  in 
model organisms promises to greatly advance our understanding of the

ChApTer 12     transport across cell Membranes

•	 Transfer	 of	 nutrients,	 metabolites,	 and	 inorganic	 ions	 across	 cell	

membranes depends on membrane transport proteins.

•	 Cell	membranes	contain	a	variety	of	transport	proteins	that	function	
either	as	transporters	or	channels,	each	responsible	for	the	transfer	
of	a	particular	type	of	solute.	

•	 Channel	proteins	form	pores	across	the	lipid	bilayer	through	which	

solutes	can	passively	diffuse.

•	 Both	 transporters	 and	 channels	 can	 mediate	 passive	 transport,	 in	
which an uncharged solute moves spontaneously down its concen-
tration gradient. 

•	 For	 the	 passive	 transport	 of	 a	 charged	 solute,	 its	 electrochemical	
gradient	determines	its	direction	of	movement,	rather	than	its	con-
centration alone.

•	 Transporters	can	act	as	pumps	to	mediate	active	transport,	in	which	
solutes are moved uphill against their concentration or electrochemi-
cal  gradients;  this  process  requires  energy  that  is  provided  by  ATP 
hydrolysis,	a	downhill	flow	of	Na+ or H+ ions, or sunlight.

•	 Transporters	transfer	specific	solutes	across	a	membrane	by	under-
going	 conformational	 changes	 that	 expose	 the	 solute-binding	 site	
first	on	one	side	of	the	membrane	and	then	on	the	other.

•	 The	Na+	pump	in	the	plasma	membrane	of	animal	cells	is	an	ATPase;	
it actively transports Na+	out	of	the	cell	and	K+ in, maintaining a steep 
Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane that is used to drive other 
active transport processes and to convey electrical signals.

•	

Ion	channels	allow	inorganic	ions	of	appropriate	size	and	charge	to	
cross the membrane. Most are gated and open transiently in response 
to	a	specific	stimulus.

•	 Even	 when	 activated	 by	 a	 specific	 stimulus,	 ion	 channels	 do	 not	
remain	continuously	open:	they	flicker	randomly	between	open	and	
closed	conformations.	An	activating	stimulus	increases	the	propor-
tion	of	time	that	the	channel	spends	in	the	open	state.

•	 The	membrane	potential	is	determined	by	the	unequal	distribution	of	
charged	ions	on	the	two	sides	of	a	cell	membrane;	it	is	altered	when	
these	ions	flow	through	open	ion	channels	in	the	membrane.	

•	

In	 most	 animal	 cells,	 the	 negative	 value	 of	 the	 resting	 membrane	
potential  across  the  plasma  membrane  depends  mainly  on  the  K+ 
gradient	and	the	operation	of	K+-selective leak channels; at this rest-
ing	 potential,	 the	 driving	 force	 for	 the	 movement	 of	 K+  across  the 
membrane is almost zero.

•	 Neurons	propagate	electrical	impulses	in	the	form	of	action	potentials,

•	 Voltage-gated	 Ca2+  channels  in  a  nerve  terminal  couple  the  arrival

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is made in the cytosol 
and then transported into synaptic vesicles, where its 
concentration is more than 100-fold higher than in the 
cytosol. When synaptic vesicles are isolated from neurons, 
they can take up additional acetylcholine added to the 
solution in which they are suspended, but only when ATp 
is present. na+ ions are not required for the uptake, but, 
curiously, raising the ph of the solution in which the synaptic 
vesicles are suspended increases the rate of uptake.

phospholipid bilayers form sealed spherical vesicles in water

lipid vesicles that contain na+ pumps as the sole membrane

way in each pumping cycle. All the na+ pumps have the 
portion of the molecule that normally faces the cytosol 
oriented toward the outside of the vesicles. With the help of 
figure 12–11, determine what would happen if:
A.  your vesicles were suspended in a solution containing 
both na+ and K+ ions and had a solution with the same ionic

d.  The concentrations of na+ and K+ were as in (A), but 
half of the pump molecules embedded in the membrane 
of each vesicle were oriented the other way around so that 
the normally cytosolic portions of these molecules faced the

concentration to rise to 5 μm? There is virtually unlimited

lumen in order to function. Acidification is achieved by an 
h+ pump in the endosomal membrane, which also contains 
cl– channels. if the channels do not function properly 
(e.g., because of a mutation in the genes encoding the 
channel proteins), acidification is also impaired.

Acetylcholine-gated cation channels do not discriminate 
between na+, K+, and ca2+ ions, allowing all to pass

How Cells Obtain Energy  
From Food

As we discussed in Chapter 3, cells require a constant supply of energy 
to generate and maintain the biological order that allows them to grow, 
divide, and carry out their day-to-day activities. This energy comes from 
the chemical-bond energy in food molecules, which thereby serve as fuel 
for cells. 

Perhaps the most important fuel molecules are the sugars. Plants make 
their own sugars from CO2 by photosynthesis. Animals obtain sugars—
and  other  organic  molecules  that  can  be  chemically  transformed  into 
sugars—by eating plants and other organisms. Nevertheless, the process 
whereby  all  these  sugars  are  broken  down  to  generate  energy  is  very 
similar  in  both  animals  and  plants.  In  both  cases,  the  organism’s  cells 
harvest useful energy from the chemical-bond energy locked in sugars as 
the sugar molecule is broken down and oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and water (H2O)—a process called cell respiration. The energy released 
during these reactions is captured in the form of “high-energy” chemi-
cal bonds—covalent bonds that release large amounts of energy when 
hydrolyzed—in activated carriers such as ATP and NADH. These carriers 
in turn serve as portable sources of the chemical groups and electrons 
needed for biosynthesis (discussed in Chapter 3).

In this chapter, we trace the major steps in the breakdown of sugars and 
show how ATP, NADH, and other activated carriers are produced along 
the way. We concentrate on the breakdown of glucose because it gener-
ates most of the energy produced in the majority of animal cells. A very 
similar pathway operates in plants, fungi, and many bacteria. Other mol-
ecules, such as fatty acids and proteins, can also serve as energy sources 
if  they  are  funneled  through  appropriate  enzymatic  pathways.  We  will

Figure 13–1 The controlled, stepwise

burning of sugar in nonliving systems 
generates more energy than can be stored 
by any carrier molecule. this energy is thus 
released as heat. (B) In a cell, enzymes 
catalyze the breakdown of sugars via a 
series of small steps, in which a portion of 
the free energy released is captured by the 
formation of activated carriers—most often 
atp and NaDh. each step is catalyzed 
by an enzyme that lowers the activation 
energy barrier that must be surmounted by 
the random collision of molecules at the 
temperature of cells (body temperature), 
so as to allow the reaction to occur. the 
total free energy released by the oxidative 
breakdown of glucose—686 kcal/mole (2880 
kJ/mole)—is exactly the same in (a) and (B).

see how cells use many of the molecules generated from the breakdown 
of sugars and fats as starting points to make other organic molecules.

Finally, we examine how cells regulate their metabolism and how they 
store food molecules for their future metabolic needs. We will save our 
discussion of the elaborate mechanism cells use to produce the bulk of 
their ATP for Chapter 14.

The breakdown and uTilizaTion of 
sugars and faTs
ECB4 e13.01/13.01
If a fuel molecule such as glucose were oxidized to CO2 and H2O in a sin-
gle step—by, for example, the direct application of fire—it would release 
an amount of energy many times larger than any carrier molecule could 
capture (Figure 13–1a). Instead, cells use enzymes to carry out the oxi-
dation  of  sugars  in  a  tightly  controlled  series  of  reactions.  Thanks  to 
the action of enzymes—which operate at temperatures typical of living 
things—cells  degrade  each  glucose  molecule  step  by  step,  paying  out 
energy in small packets to activated carriers by means of coupled reac-
tions  (Figure  13–1B).  In  this  way,  much  of  the  energy  released  by  the 
breakdown of glucose is saved in the high-energy bonds of ATP and other 
activated carriers, which can then be made available to do useful work 
for the cell.

Animal cells make ATP in two ways. First, certain energetically favora-
ble, enzyme-catalyzed reactions involved in the breakdown of foods are 
directly  coupled  to  the  energetically  unfavorable  reaction  ADP  +  Pi  → 
ATP.  Thus  the  oxidation  of  food  molecules  can  provide  energy  for  the 
immediate production of ATP. Most ATP synthesis, however, requires an 
intermediary.  In  this  second  pathway  to  making  ATP,  the  energy  from 
other  activated  carriers  is  used  to  drive  ATP  production.  This  process, 
called oxidative phosphorylation, takes place on the inner mitochondrial 
membrane (Figure 13–2), and it is described in detail in Chapter 14. In this 
chapter, we focus on the first sequence of reactions by which food mol-
ecules are oxidized—both in the cytosol and in the mitochondrial matrix 
(see Figure 13–2). These reactions produce both ATP and the additional

Figure 13–3 The breakdown of food 
molecules occurs in three stages. 
(a) Stage 1 mostly occurs outside cells 
in the mouth and the gut—although 
intracellular lysosomes can also digest 
large organic molecules. Stage 2 occurs 
mainly in the cytosol, except for the final 
step of conversion of pyruvate to acetyl 
groups on acetyl coa, which occurs in the 
mitochondrial matrix. Stage 3 begins with 
the citric acid cycle in the mitochondrial 
matrix and concludes with oxidative 
phosphorylation on the mitochondrial inner 
membrane. the NaDh generated in stage 
2—during glycolysis and the conversion 
of pyruvate to acetyl coa—adds to the 
NaDh produced by the citric acid cycle to 
drive the production of atp by oxidative 
phosphorylation. 
   (B) the net products of the complete 
oxidation of food include atp, NaDh, cO2, 
and h2O. the atp and NaDh provide 
the energy and electrons needed for 
biosynthesis; the cO2 and h2O are waste 
products.

food molecules are broken down in Three stages
The proteins, fats, and polysaccharides that make up most of the food we 
eat must be broken down into smaller molecules before our cells can use 
them—either as a source of energy or as building blocks for making other 
organic molecules. This breakdown process—in which enzymes degrade 
complex organic molecules into simpler ones—is called catabolism. The 
process takes place in three stages, as illustrated in Figure 13–3.

CHapTER 13     how cells Obtain energy From Food

In stage 1 of catabolism, enzymes convert the large polymeric molecules 
in  food  into  simpler  monomeric  subunits:  proteins  into  amino  acids, 
polysaccharides into sugars, and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. This 
stage—also called digestion—occurs either outside cells (in the intestine) 
or in specialized organelles within cells called lysosomes (discussed in 
Chapter  15).  After  digestion,  the  small  organic  molecules  derived  from 
food enter the cytosol of a cell, where their gradual oxidative breakdown 
begins. 
In stage 2 of catabolism, a chain of reactions called glycolysis splits each 
molecule of glucose into two smaller molecules of pyruvate. Sugars other 
than glucose can also be used, after first being converted into one of the 
intermediates  in  this  sugar-splitting  pathway.  Glycolysis  takes  place  in 
the cytosol and, in addition to producing pyruvate, it generates two types 
of activated carriers: ATP and NADH. The pyruvate is transported from 
the cytosol into the mitochondrion’s large, internal compartment called 
the matrix. There, a giant enzyme complex converts each pyruvate mol-
ecule into CO2 plus acetyl CoA, another of the activated carriers discussed 
in Chapter 3 (see Figure 3–36). In the same compartment, large amounts 
of acetyl CoA are also produced by the stepwise oxidative breakdown of 
fatty acids derived from fats (see Figure 13–3).
Stage  3  of  catabolism  takes  place  entirely  in  mitochondria.  The  acetyl 
group in acetyl CoA is transferred to an oxaloacetate molecule to form 
citrate, which enters a series of reactions called the citric acid cycle. In 
these reactions, the transferred acetyl group is oxidized to CO2 with the 
production of large amounts of NADH. Finally, the high-energy electrons 
from NADH are passed along a series of enzymes within the mitochon-
drial inner membrane called an electron-transport chain, where the energy 
released by their transfer is used to drive oxidative phosphorylation—a 
process that produces ATP and consumes molecular oxygen (O2 gas). It is 
in these final steps of catabolism that the majority of the energy released 
by oxidation is harnessed to produce most of the cell’s ATP.

Through the production of ATP, the energy derived from the breakdown 
of sugars and fats is redistributed into packets of chemical energy in a 
form convenient for use in the cell. In total, nearly half of the energy that 
could, in theory, be derived from the breakdown of glucose or fatty acids 
to H2O and CO2 is captured and used to drive the energetically unfavora-
ble reaction ADP + Pi → ATP. By contrast, a modern combustion engine, 
such  as  a  car  engine,  can  convert  no  more  than  20%  of  the  available 
energy in its fuel into useful work. In both cases, the remaining energy is 
released as heat, which in animals helps to keep the body warm.
Roughly  109  molecules  of  ATP  are  in  solution  in  a  typical  cell  at  any 
instant. In many cells, all of this ATP is turned over (that is, consumed and 
replaced) every 1–2 minutes. An average person at rest will hydrolyze his 
or her weight in ATP molecules every 24 hours.

glycolysis extracts energy from the splitting of sugar
The central process in stage 2 of catabolism is the oxidative breakdown 
of glucose in the sequence of reactions known as glycolysis. Glycolysis 
produces ATP without the involvement of oxygen. It occurs in the cytosol 
of  most  cells,  including  many  anaerobic  microorganisms  that  thrive  in 
the absence of oxygen. Glycolysis probably evolved early in the history 
of life on Earth, before photosynthetic organisms introduced oxygen into 
the atmosphere. 
The  term  “glycolysis”  comes  from  the  Greek  glykys,  “sweet,”  and  lysis, 
“splitting.”  It  is  an  appropriate  name,  as  glycolysis  splits  a  molecule  of 
glucose,  which  has  six  carbon  atoms,  to  form  two  molecules  of  pyru-
vate, each of which contains three carbon atoms. The series of chemical

rearrangements that ultimately generate pyruvate release energy because 
the  electrons  in  a  molecule  of  pyruvate  are,  overall,  at  a  lower  energy 
state  than  those  in  a  molecule  of  glucose.  Nevertheless,  for  each  mol-
ecule of glucose that enters glycolysis, two molecules of ATP are initially 
consumed to provide the energy needed to prepare the sugar to be split. 
This  investment  of  energy  is  more  than  recouped  in  the  later  steps  of 
glycolysis, when four molecules of ATP are produced. Energy is also cap-
tured  in  this  “payoff  phase”  in  the  form  of  NADH.  Thus,  at  the  end  of 
glycolysis, there is a net gain of two molecules of ATP and two molecules 
of NADH for each glucose molecule broken down (Figure 13–4).

glycolysis Produces both aTP and nadh
Piecing  together  the  complete  glycolytic  pathway  in  the  1930s  was  a 
major  triumph  of  biochemistry,  as  the  pathway  consists  of  a  sequence 
of 10 separate reactions, each producing a different sugar intermediate 
and each catalyzed by a different enzyme. Like most enzymes, those that 
catalyze  glycolysis  all  have  names  ending  in  -ase—like  isomerase  and 
dehydrogenase—which specify the type of reaction they catalyze (Table 
13–1). The reactions of the glycolytic pathway are presented in outline in 
Figure 13–5 and in detail in panel 13–1 (pp. 428–429).

Figure 13–5 The stepwise breakdown 
of sugars begins with glycolysis. each of 
the 10 steps of glycolysis is catalyzed by a 
different enzyme. Note that step 4 cleaves 
a six-carbon sugar into two three-carbon 
sugars, so that the number of molecules at 
every stage after this doubles. Note also 
that one of the products of step 4 needs to 
be modified (isomerized) in step 5 before 
it can proceed to step 6 (see panel 13–1). 
as indicated, step 6 begins the energy-
generation phase of glycolysis, which results 
in the net synthesis of atp and NaDh 
(see also Figure 13–4). Glycolysis is also 
sometimes referred to as the embden–
Meyerhof pathway, named for the chemists 
who first described it. all the steps of 
glycolysis are reviewed in Movie 13.1.

Much  of  the  energy  released  by  the  breakdown  of  glucose  is  used  to 
drive the synthesis of ATP molecules from ADP and Pi. This form of ATP 
synthesis,  which  takes  place  in  steps  7  and  10  in  glycolysis,  is  known 
as substrate-level phosphorylation because it occurs by the transfer of a 
phosphate  group  directly  from  a  substrate  molecule—one  of  the  sugar 
intermediates—to ADP. By contrast, most phosphorylations in cells occur 
by the transfer of phosphate from ATP to a substrate molecule. 

ECB4 e13.03/13.05

The remainder of the energy released during glycolysis is stored in the 
electrons  in  the  NADH  molecule  produced  in  step  6  by  an  oxidation 
reaction. As discussed in Chapter 3, oxidation does not always involve 
oxygen;  it  occurs  in  any  reaction  in  which  electrons  are  lost  from  one 
atom  and  transferred  to  another.  So,  although  no  molecular  oxygen  is 
involved in glycolysis, oxidation does occur: in step 6, a hydrogen atom 
plus an electron is removed from the sugar intermediate, glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate, and transferred to NAD+, producing NADH (see Panel 13–1, 
p. 428). 

Over  the  course  of  glycolysis,  two  molecules  of  NADH  are  formed  per 
molecule of glucose. In aerobic organisms, these NADH molecules donate 
their electrons to the electron-transport chain in the inner mitochondrial 
membrane, as described in detail in Chapter 14. Such electron transfers 
release  energy  as  the  electrons  fall  from  a  state  of  higher  energy  to  a 

the Breakdown and Utilization of Sugars and Fats

lower  one.  The  electrons  that  are  passed  along  the  electron-transport 
chain are ultimately passed on to O2, forming water.
In giving up its electrons, NADH is converted back into NAD+, which is 
then available to be used again for glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, 
NAD+ can be regenerated by an alternate type of energy-yielding reaction 
called a fermentation, as we discuss next.

fermentations Can Produce aTP in the absence of 
oxygen
For most animal and plant cells, glycolysis is only a prelude to the third 
and  final  stage  of  the  breakdown  of  food  molecules,  in  which  large 
amounts  of  ATP  are  generated  in  mitochondria  by  oxidative  phospho-
rylation, a process that requires the consumption of oxygen. However, 
for many anaerobic microorganisms, which can grow and divide in the 
absence of oxygen, glycolysis is the principal source of ATP. The same 
is true for certain animal cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, which can 
continue to function at low levels of oxygen. 

In  these  anaerobic  conditions,  the  pyruvate  and  NADH  made  by  gly-
colysis  remain  in  the  cytosol.  The  pyruvate  is  converted  into  products 
that are excreted from the cell: lactate in muscle cells, for example, or 
ethanol  and  CO2  in  the  yeast  cells  used  in  brewing  and  breadmaking. 
The NADH gives up its electrons in the cytosol, and is converted back to 
the NAD+ required to maintain the reactions of glycolysis (Figure 13–6). 
Such energy-yielding pathways that break down sugar in the absence of 
oxygen are called fermentations. Scientific studies of the commercially 
important  fermentations  carried  out  by  yeasts  laid  the  foundations  for 
early biochemistry.

at first glance, the final steps 
in fermentation appear to be 
unnecessary: the generation of 
lactate or ethanol does not produce 
any additional energy for the cell. 
explain why cells growing in the 
absence of oxygen could not simply 
discard pyruvate as a waste product. 
which products derived from 
glucose would accumulate in cells 
unable to generate either lactate or 
ethanol by fermentation?

Figure 13–6 pyruvate is broken down in 
the absence of oxygen by fermentation. 
(a) When inadequate oxygen is present, 
for example, in a muscle cell undergoing 
vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced 
by glycolysis is converted to lactate in the 
cytosol. this reaction restores the NaD+ 
consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the 
whole pathway yields much less energy 
overall than if the pyruvate were oxidized 
in mitochondria. (B) In microorganisms 
that can grow anaerobically, pyruvate is 
converted into carbon dioxide and ethanol. 
again, this pathway regenerates NaD+ from 
NaDh, as required to enable glycolysis to 
continue. Both (a) and (B) are examples 
of fermentations. Note that in both cases, 
for each molecule of glucose that enters 
glycolysis, two molecules of pyruvate are 
generated (only a single pyruvate is shown 
here). Fermentation of these two pyruvates 
subsequently yields two molecules of 
lactate—or two molecules of cO2 and 
ethanol—plus two molecules of NaD+.

Figure 13–8 Differences in the energies 
of different phosphate bonds allow the 
formation of aTp by substrate-level 
phosphorylation. examples of molecules 
containing different types of phosphate 
bonds are shown, along with the free-
energy change for hydrolysis of those bonds 
in kcal/mole (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). the transfer 
of a phosphate group from one molecule 
to another is energetically favorable if 
the standard free-energy change (∆Gº) 
for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond is 
more negative for the donor molecule 
than for the acceptor. (the hydrolysis 
reactions can be thought of as the transfer 
of the phosphate group to water.) thus, 
a phosphate group is readily transferred 
from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to aDp to 
form atp. transfer reactions involving the 
phosphate groups in these molecules are 
detailed in panel 13–1 (pp. 428–429).

Many bacteria and archaea can also generate ATP in the absence of oxy-
gen by anaerobic respiration, a process that uses a molecule other than 
oxygen  as  a  final  electron  acceptor.  Anaerobic  respiration  differs  from 
fermentation in that it involves an electron-transport chain embedded in 
a membrane—in this case, the plasma membrane of the microbe.

glycolytic enzymes Couple oxidation to energy storage in 
activated Carriers
The  “paddle  wheel”  analogy  in  Chapter  3  explained  how  cells  harvest 
useful  energy  from  the  oxidation  of  organic  molecules  by  coupling  an 
energetically  unfavorable  reaction  to  an  energetically  favorable  one 
(see Figure 3–30). Here, we take a closer look at a key pair of glycolytic 
reactions that demonstrate how enzymes—the paddle wheel in our anal-
ogy—allow coupled reactions to facilitate the transfer of chemical energy 
to ATP and NADH.

The  reactions  in  question—steps  6  and  7  in  Panel  13–1—convert  the 
three-carbon  sugar  intermediate  glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  (an  alde-
hyde)  into  3-phosphoglycerate  (a  carboxylic  acid).  This  conversion, 
which  entails  the  oxidation  of  an  aldehyde  group  to  a  carboxylic  acid 
group,  occurs  in  two  steps.  The  overall  reaction  releases  enough  free 
energy  to  transfer  two  electrons  from  the  aldehyde  to  NAD+  to  form 
NADH and to transfer a phosphate group to a molecule of ADP to form 
ATP. It also releases enough heat to the environment to make the overall 
reaction energetically favorable: the ∆Gº for step 6 followed by step 7 is 
–3.0 kcal/mole (Figure 13–7).

The energy contained in any phosphate bond can be determined by meas-
uring the standard free-energy change (∆Gº) when that bond is broken 
by hydrolysis. Molecules that contain phosphate bonds that have more 
energy than those found in ATP—including the high-energy 1,3-bisphos-
phoglycerate  generated  in  step  6  of  glycolysis—readily  transfer  their 
phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. Figure 13–8 compares the high-
energy phosphoanhydride bond in ATP with a few of the other phosphate 
bonds that are generated during glycolysis. As explained in Panel 13–1, 
we describe these bonds as “high energy” only in that their hydrolysis is 
particularly energetically favorable.

The reaction in step 6 is the only one in glycolysis that creates a high-
energy phosphate linkage directly from inorganic phosphate—an example 
of the substrate-level phosphorylation mentioned earlier. How this high-
energy linkage is generated in step 6—and then consumed in step 7 to 
produce ATP—is detailed in Figure 13–9.

formulate your explanation in the 
context of figure 13–7.

Figure 13–9 The oxidation of 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is coupled 
to the formation of aTp and NaDH in 
steps 6 and 7 of glycolysis. (a) In step 6, 
the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase couples the energetically 
favorable oxidation of an aldehyde to 
the energetically unfavorable formation 
of a high-energy phosphate bond. at 
the same time, it enables energy to be 
stored in NaDh. the formation of the 
high-energy phosphate bond is driven by 
the oxidation reaction, and the enzyme 
thereby acts like the “paddle wheel” 
coupler in Figure 3–30B. In step 7, the 
newly formed high-energy phosphate bond 
in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is transferred 
to aDp, forming a molecule of atp and 
leaving a free carboxylic acid group on the 
oxidized sugar. the part of the molecule 
that undergoes a change is shaded in blue; 
the rest of the molecule remains unchanged 
throughout all these reactions. (B) Summary

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is 
oxidized as the enzyme removes a 
hydrogen atom (yellow) and 
transfers it, along with an electron, 
to NAD+, forming NADH (see 
Figure 3.34). Part of the energy 
released by the oxidation of the 
aldehyde is thus stored in NADH, 
and part is stored in the high-

glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to the

Figure 13–10 pyruvate is converted into acetyl Coa and CO2 by 
the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the mitochondrial matrix. 
(a) the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which contains multiple 
copies of three different enzymes—pyruvate dehydrogenase (1), 
dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (3)— 
converts pyruvate to acetyl coa; NaDh and cO2 are also produced in 
this reaction. pyruvate and its products are shown in red lettering. 
(B) In this large multienzyme complex, reaction intermediates are 
passed directly from one enzyme to another via flexible tethers. Only 
one-tenth of the subunits labeled 1 and 3, attached to the core formed 
by subunit 2, are shown here. to get a sense of scale, the pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex is larger than a ribosome.

several organic molecules are Converted to acetyl Coa 
in the mitochondrial matrix
In  aerobic  metabolism  in  eukaryotic  cells,  the  pyruvate  produced  by 
glycolysis is actively pumped into the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 
13–3).  There,  it  is  rapidly  decarboxylated  by  a  giant  complex  of  three 
enzymes,  called  the  pyruvate  dehydrogenase  complex.  The  products  of 
pyruvate decarboxylation are CO2 (a waste product), NADH, and acetyl 
CoA (Figure 13–10).
In  addition  to  sugar,  which  is  broken  down  during  glycolysis,  fat  is  a 
major source of energy for most nonphotosynthetic organisms, includ-
ing  humans.  Like  the  pyruvate  derived  from  glycolysis,  the  fatty  acids 
derived from fat are also converted into acetyl CoA in the mitochondrial 
matrix (see Figure 13–3). Fatty acids are first activated by covalent link-
age to CoA and are then broken down completely by a cycle of reactions 
that trims two carbons at a time from their carboxyl end, generating one 
molecule of acetyl CoA for each turn of the cycle. Two activated carri-
ers—NADH  and  another  high-energy  electron  carrier,  FADH2—are  also 
produced in this process (Figure 13–11).

In addition to pyruvate and fatty acids, some amino acids are transported 
from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix, where they are also con-
verted into acetyl CoA or one of the other intermediates of the citric acid 
cycle (see Figure 13–3). Thus, in the eukaryotic cell, the mitochondrion 
is the center toward which all energy-yielding catabolic processes lead, 
whether they begin with sugars, fats, or proteins. In aerobic bacteria—
which have no mitochondria—glycolysis and acetyl CoA production, as 
well as the citric acid cycle, take place in the cytosol.

Catabolism does not end with the production of acetyl CoA. In the proc-
ess of converting food molecules to acetyl CoA, only a small part of their 
stored energy is extracted and converted into ATP, NADH, or FADH2. Most 
of that energy is still locked up in acetyl CoA. The next stage in cell res-
piration is the citric acid cycle, in which the acetyl group in acetyl CoA is 
oxidized to CO2 and H2O in the mitochondrial matrix, as we now discuss. 

The Citric acid Cycle generates nadh by oxidizing 
acetyl groups to Co2
The citric acid cycle accounts for about two-thirds of the total oxidation 
of carbon compounds in most cells, and its major end products are CO2 
and high-energy electrons in the form of NADH. The CO2 is released as 
a waste product, while the high-energy electrons from NADH are passed 
to the electron-transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. At 
the end of the chain, these electrons combine with O2 to produce H2O. 
The  citric  acid  cycle,  which  takes  place  in  the  mitochondrial  matrix, 
does not itself use O2. However, it requires O2 to proceed because the

electron-transport  chain—which  uses  O2  as  its  final  acceptor—allows 
NADH to get rid of its electrons and thus regenerate the NAD+ needed 
to keep the cycle going. Although living organisms have inhabited Earth 
for the past 3.5 billion years, the planet is thought to have developed an 
atmosphere  containing  O2  gas  only  some  1  to  2  billion  years  ago  (see 
Figure 14–45). Many of the energy-generating reactions of the citric acid 
cycle—also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle—are there-
fore likely to be of relatively recent origin. 

ECB4 e13.09/13.11

The citric acid cycle catalyzes the complete oxidation of the carbon atoms 
of the acetyl groups in acetyl CoA, converting them into CO2. The acetyl 
group  is  not  oxidized  directly,  however.  Instead,  it  is  transferred  from 
acetyl CoA to a larger four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form the 
six-carbon tricarboxylic acid, citric acid, for which the subsequent cycle 
of reactions is named. The citric acid molecule (also called citrate) is then 
progressively oxidized, and the energy of this oxidation is harnessed to 
produce activated carriers in much the same manner as we described for 
glycolysis. The chain of eight reactions forms a cycle, because the oxaloa-
cetate that began the process is regenerated at the end (Figure 13–12). 
The citric acid cycle is presented in detail in panel 13–2 (pp. 434–435), 
and the experiments that first revealed the cyclic nature of this series of 
oxidative reactions are described in How We Know, pp. 436–437.

many catabolic and anabolic 
reactions are based on reactions 
that are similar but work in opposite 
directions, such as the hydrolysis 
and condensation reactions 
described in figure 3–38. This is true 
for fatty acid breakdown and fatty 
acid synthesis. from what you know 
about the mechanism of fatty acid 
breakdown outlined in figure 13–11, 
would you expect the fatty acids 
found in cells to most commonly 
have an even or an odd number of 
carbon atoms?

NET RESULT:   ONE TURN OF THE CYCLE PRODUCES THREE NADH, ONE GTP, AND

ONE FADH2, AND RELEASES TWO MOLECULES OF CO2

Thus  far,  we  have  discussed  only  one  of  the  three  types  of  activated 
carriers  that  are  produced  by  the  citric  acid  cycle—NADH.  In  addition 
to three molecules of NADH, each turn of the cycle also produces one 
molecule  of  FADH2  (reduced  flavin  adenine  dinucleotide)  from  FAD 
and  one  molecule  of  the  ribonucleoside  triphosphate  GTP  (guanosine 
triphosphate) from GDP (see Figure 13–12). The structures of these two 
activated carriers are illustrated in Figure 13–13. GTP is a close relative 
of ATP, and the transfer of its terminal phosphate group to ADP produces 
one ATP molecule in each cycle. Like NADH, FADH2 is a carrier of high-
energy electrons and hydrogen. As we discuss shortly, the energy stored 
in the readily transferred high-energy electrons of NADH and FADH2 is

subsequently used to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation on 
the inner mitochondrial membrane, the only step in the oxidative catabo-
lism of foodstuffs that directly requires O2 from the atmosphere.
A common misconception about the citric acid cycle is that the atmos-
pheric O2 required for the process to proceed is converted into the CO2 
that is released as a waste product. In fact, the oxygen atoms required 
to  make  CO2  from  the  acetyl  groups  entering  the  citric  acid  cycle  are 
supplied not by O2 but by water. As illustrated in Panel 13–2, three mol-
ecules of water are split in each cycle, and the oxygen atoms of some of 
them are ultimately used to make CO2. As we see shortly, the O2 that we 
breathe is actually reduced to water by the electron-transport chain; it is 
not incorporated directly into the CO2 we exhale. 

many biosynthetic Pathways begin with glycolysis or the 
Citric acid Cycle
Catabolic reactions, such as those of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, 
produce both energy for the cell and the building blocks from which many 
other organic molecules are made. So far, we have emphasized energy 
production  rather  than  the  provision  of  starting  materials  for  biosyn-
thesis. But many of the intermediates formed in glycolysis and the citric 
acid cycle are siphoned off by such anabolic pathways, in which they 
are converted by series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions into amino acids, 
nucleotides, lipids, and other small organic molecules that the cell needs. 
Oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate from the citric acid cycle, for example, 
are transferred from the mitochondrial matrix back to the cytosol, where 
they serve as precursors for the production of many essential molecules, 
such as the amino acids aspartate and glutamate, respectively. An idea of 
the complexity of this process can be gathered from Figure 13–14, which 
illustrates some of the branches leading from the central catabolic reac-
tions to biosyntheses.

HOW WE KNOW
uNRaVElING THE CITRIC aCID CYClE

“I  have  often  been  asked  how  the  work  on  the  citric 
acid  cycle  arose  and  developed,”  stated  biochemist 
Hans Krebs in a lecture and review article in which he 
described his Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the cycle 
of  reactions  that  lies  at  the  center  of  cell  metabolism. 
Did the concept stem from a sudden inspiration, a rev-
elatory  vision?  “It  was  nothing  of  the  kind,”  answered 
Krebs. Instead, his realization that these reactions occur 
in  a  cycle—rather  than  a  set  of  linear  pathways,  as  in 
glycolysis—arose from a “very slow evolutionary proc-
ess” that occurred over a five-year period, during which 
Krebs coupled insight and reasoning to careful experi-
mentation to discover one of the central pathways that 
underlies energy metabolism.

minced tissues, curious catalysis
By  the  early  1930s,  Krebs  and  other  investigators  had 
discovered that a select set of small organic molecules 
are  oxidized  extraordinarily  rapidly  in  various  types  of 
tissue preparations—slices of kidney or liver, or suspen-
sions of minced pigeon muscle. Because these reactions 
were  seen  to  depend  on  the  presence  of  oxygen,  the 
researchers  surmised  that  this  set  of  molecules  might 
include intermediates that are important in cell respira-
tion—the consumption of O2 and production of CO2 that 
occurs when tissues break down foodstuffs.

Using the minced-tissue preparations, Krebs and others 
made the following observations. First, in the presence 
of  oxygen,  certain  organic  acids—citrate,  succinate, 
fumarate,  and  malate—were  readily  oxidized  to  CO2. 
These  reactions  depended  on  a  continuous  supply  of 
oxygen. 

Second, the oxidation of these acids occurred in two lin-
ear, sequential pathways:

citrate → α-ketoglutarate → succinate

and

succinate → fumarate → malate → oxaloacetate

Third, the addition of small amounts of several of these 
compounds  to  the  minced-muscle  suspensions  stimu-
lated an unusually large uptake of O2—far greater than 
that  needed  to  oxidize  only  the  added  molecules.  To 
explain this surprising observation, Albert Szent-Györgyi 
(the  Nobel  laureate  who  worked  out  the  second  path-
way  above)  suggested  that  a  single  molecule  of  each 
compound must somehow act catalytically to stimulate 
the oxidation of many molecules of some endogenous 
substance in the muscle. 

At this point, most of the reactions central to the citric 
acid  cycle  were  known.  What  was  not  yet  clear—and 
caused  great  confusion,  even  to  future  Nobel  laure-
ates—was how these apparently linear reactions could 

drive  such  a  catalytic  consumption  of  oxygen,  where 
each molecule of metabolite fuels the oxidation of many 
more molecules. To simplify the discussion of how Krebs 
ultimately  solved  this  puzzle—by  linking  these  linear 
reactions together into a circle—we will now refer to the 
molecules involved by a sequence of letters, A through 
H (Figure 13–15).

did not initially realize that these oxidation reactions occur in a 
cycle, as shown here.

ECB4 e13.13/13.14

a poison suggests a cycle
Many of the clues that Krebs used to work out the citric 
acid  cycle  came  from  experiments  using  malonate—
a  poisonous  compound  that  specifically  inhibits  the 
enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which converts E to F. 
Malonate closely resembles succinate (E) in its structure  
(Figure 13–16), and it serves as a competitive inhibitor of

the enzyme. Because the addition of malonate poisons 
cell  respiration  in  tissues,  Krebs  concluded  that  succi-
nate dehydrogenase (and the entire pathway linked to it) 
must play a critical role in the respiration process.

Krebs then discovered that when A, B, or C was added 
to  malonate-poisoned  tissue  suspensions,  E  accumu-
lated  (Figure  13–17a).  This  observation  reinforced  the 
importance  of  succinate  dehydrogenase  for  successful 
cell respiration. However, he found that E also accumu-
lated when F, G, or H was added to malonate-poisoned 
muscle (Figure 13–17B). The latter result suggested that 
an additional set of reactions must exist that can con-
vert F, G, and H molecules into E, since E was previously 
shown to be a precursor for F, G, and H, rather than a 
product of their reactions.

Figure 13–17 poisoning muscle preparations with malonate 
provided clues to the cyclic nature of these oxidative 
reactions. (a) adding a (or B or c—not shown) to malonate-
poisoned muscle causes an accumulation of e. (B) addition of F 
(or G or h—not shown) to a malonate-poisoned preparation also 
causes an accumulation of e, suggesting that enzymatic reactions 
can convert these molecules into e. the discovery that citrate (a) 
can be formed from oxaloacetate (h) and pyruvate allowed Krebs 
to join these two reaction pathways into a complete circle. 

ECB4 e13.15/13.16

At  about  this  time,  Krebs  also  determined  that  when 
muscle suspensions were incubated with pyruvate and 
oxaloacetate, citrate formed: pyruvate + H → A.
This observation led Krebs to postulate that when oxy-
gen  is  present,  pyruvate  and  H  condense  to  form  A, 
converting  the  previously  delineated  string  of  linear 
reactions into a cyclic sequence (see Figure 13–15). 

explaining the mysterious stimulatory effects
The  cycle  of  reactions  that  Krebs  proposed  clearly 
explained  how  the  addition  of  small  amounts  of  any 
of the intermediates A through H could cause the large 
increase  in  the  uptake  of  O2  that  had  been  observed. 
Pyruvate  is  abundant  in  minced  tissues,  being  readily 
produced by glycolysis (see Figure 13–4), using glucose 
derived  from  stored  glycogen.  Its  oxidation  requires  a 
functioning citric acid cycle, in which each turn of the 
cycle results in the oxidation of one molecule of pyru-
vate.  If  the  intermediates  A  through  H  are  in  small 
enough supply, the rate at which the entire cycle turns 
will be restricted. Adding a supply of any one of these 
intermediates  will  then  have  a  dramatic  effect  on  the 
rate at which the entire cycle operates. Thus, it is easy 
to see how a large number of pyruvate molecules can 
be oxidized, and a great deal of oxygen consumed, for 
every molecule of a citric acid cycle intermediate that is 
added (Figure 13–18).

Krebs went on to demonstrate that all of the individual 
enzymatic  reactions  in  his  postulated  cycle  took  place 
in  tissue  preparations.  Furthermore,  they  occured  at 
rates  high  enough  to  account  for  the  rate  of  pyruvate 
and oxygen consumption in these tissues. Krebs there-
fore concluded that this series of reactions is the major, 
if not the sole, pathway for the oxidation of pyruvate—at 
least in muscle. By fitting together pieces of information 
like a jigsaw puzzle, he arrived at a coherent picture of 
the intricate metabolic processes that underlie the oxi-
dation—and took home a share of the 1953 Nobel Prize 
in Physiology or Medicine.

Figure 13–18 Replenishing the supply of any single 
intermediate has a dramatic effect on the rate at which the 
entire citric acid cycle operates. When the concentrations 
of intermediates are limiting, the cycle turns slowly and 
little pyruvate is used. O2 uptake is low because only small 
amounts of NaDh and FaDh2 are produced to feed oxidative 
phosphorylation (see Figure 13–19). But when a large amount of 
any one intermediate is added, the cycle turns rapidly; more of all 
the intermediates is made, and O2 uptake is high.

electron Transport drives the synthesis of the majority of

We  now  return  briefly  to  the  final  stage  in  the  oxidation  of  food  mol-
ecules: oxidative phosphorylation. It is in this stage that the chemical 
energy captured by the activated carriers produced during glycolysis and 
the citric acid cycle is used to generate ATP. During oxidative phospho-
rylation,  NADH  and  FADH2  transfer  their  high-energy  electrons  to  the 
electron-transport chain—a series of electron carriers embedded in the 
inner  mitochondrial  membrane  in  eukaryotic  cells  (and  in  the  plasma 
membrane of aerobic bacteria). As the electrons pass through the series 
of electron acceptor and donor molecules that form the chain, they fall to 
successively lower energy states. At specific sites in the chain, the energy 
released is used to drive H+ (protons) across the inner membrane, from 
the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space (see Figure 13–2). 
This movement generates a proton gradient across the inner membrane, 
which serves as a source of energy (like a battery) that can be tapped to 
drive a variety of energy-requiring reactions (discussed in Chapter 12). 
The most prominent of these reactions is the phosphorylation of ADP to 
generate ATP on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Figure 13–19). 

At the end of the transport chain, the electrons are added to molecules of 
O2 that have diffused into the mitochondrion, and the resulting reduced 
oxygen molecules immediately combine with protons (H+) from the sur-
rounding  solution  to  produce  water  (see  Figure  13–19).  The  electrons 
have now reached their lowest energy level, with all the available energy 
extracted from the food molecule being oxidized. In total, the complete 
oxidation of a molecule of glucose to H2O and CO2 can produce about 30 
molecules of ATP. In contrast, only two molecules of ATP are produced 
per molecule of glucose by glycolysis alone.

Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in both eukaryotic cells and in aerobic 
bacteria. It represents a remarkable evolutionary achievement, and the 
ability to extract energy from food with such great efficiency has shaped 
the entire character of life on Earth. In the next chapter, we describe the 
mechanisms behind this game-changing molecular process and discuss 
how it likely arose.

OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION

regulaTion of meTabolism
A cell is an intricate chemical machine, and our discussion of metabo-
lism—with a focus on glycolysis and the citric acid cycle—has considered 
only a tiny fraction of the many enzymatic reactions that can take place in 
a cell at any time (Figure 13–20). For all these pathways to work together 
smoothly, as is required to allow the cell to survive and to respond to its 
environment, the choice of which pathway each metabolite will follow 
must be carefully regulated at every branch point.

Many sets of reactions need to be coordinated and controlled. For exam-
ple, to maintain order within their cells, all organisms need to replenish 
their  ATP  pools  continuously  through  the  oxidation  of  sugars  or  fats. 
Yet animals have only periodic access to food, and plants need to sur-
vive without sunlight overnight, when they are unable to produce sugar 
through photosynthesis. Animals and plants have evolved several ways 
to cope with this problem. One is to synthesize food reserves in times of 
plenty that can be later consumed when other energy sources are scarce. 
Thus,  depending  on  conditions,  a  cell  must  decide  whether  to  route 
key  metabolites  into  anabolic  or  catabolic  pathways—in  other  words, 
whether to use them to build other molecules or burn them to provide

immediate  energy.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  how  a  cell  regulates  its 
intricate web of interconnected metabolic pathways to best serve both its 
immediate and long-term needs. 

Catabolic and anabolic reactions are organized and 
regulated
All the reactions shown in Figure 13–20 occur in a cell that is less than 
0.1 mm in diameter, and each step requires a different enzyme. To add 
to the complexity, the same substrate is often a part of many different 
pathways. Pyruvate, for example, is a substrate for half a dozen or more 
different  enzymes,  each  of  which  modifies  it  chemically  in  a  different 
way.  We  have  already  seen  that  the  pyruvate  dehydrogenase  complex 
converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, and that, during fermentation, lactate 
dehydrogenase converts it to lactate. A third enzyme converts pyruvate 
to oxaloacetate, a fourth to the amino acid alanine, and so on. All these 
pathways compete for pyruvate molecules, and similar competitions for 
thousands of other small molecules go on at the same time. 

To  balance  the  activities  of  these  interrelated  reactions—and  to  allow 
organisms  to  adapt  swiftly  to  changes  in  food  availability  or  energy 
expenditure—an elaborate network of control mechanisms regulates and 
coordinates  the  activity  of  the  enzymes  that  catalyze  the  myriad  met-
abolic  reactions  that  go  on  in  a  cell.  As  we  discuss  in  Chapter  4,  the 
activity  of  enzymes  can  be  controlled  by  covalent  modification—such 
as the addition or removal of a phosphate group (see Figure 4–41)—and 
by  the  binding  of  small  regulatory  molecules,  often  a  metabolite  (see  
pp.  150–151).  Such  regulation  can  either  enhance  the  activity  of  the 
enzyme or inhibit it. As we see next, both types of regulation—positive 
and negative—control the activity of key enzymes involved in the break-
down and synthesis of glucose.

feedback regulation allows Cells to switch from glucose 
breakdown to glucose synthesis 
Animals need an ample supply of glucose. Active muscles need glucose 
to power their contraction, and brain cells depend almost completely on 
glucose for energy. During periods of fasting or intense physical exercise, 
the body’s glucose reserves get used up faster than they can be replen-
ished from food. One way to increase available glucose is to synthesize it 
from pyruvate by a process called gluconeogenesis. 
Gluconeogenesis  is,  in  many  ways,  a  reversal  of  glycolysis:  it  builds 
glucose  from  pyruvate,  whereas  glycolysis  does  the  opposite.  Indeed, 
gluconeogenesis makes use of many of the same enzymes as glycolysis; 
it simply runs them in reverse. For example, the isomerase that converts 
glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in step 2 of glycolysis (see 
Panel 13–1, pp. 428–429) will readily catalyze the reverse reaction. There 
are, however, three steps in glycolysis that so strongly favor the direction 
of glucose breakdown that they are effectively irreversible. To get around 
these one-way steps, gluconeogenesis uses a special set of enzymes to 
catalyze a set of bypass reactions. In step 3 of glycolysis, for example, 
the enzyme phosphofructokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of fruc-
tose 6-phosphate to produce the intermediate fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. 
In  gluconeogenesis,  the  enzyme  fructose  1, 6-bisphosphatase  removes 
a  phosphate  from  this  intermediate  to  produce  fructose  6-phosphate 
(Figure 13–21). 

How does a cell decide whether to synthesize glucose or to degrade it? 
Part of the decision centers on the reactions shown in Figure 13–21. The 
activity of the enzyme phosphofructokinase is allosterically regulated by 

regulation of Metabolism

specific enzymes to bypass those steps in 
glycolysis that are essentially irreversible. 
the enzyme phosphofructokinase 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of 
fructose 6-phosphate to form fructose 
1, 6-bisphosphate in step 3 of glycolysis. 
this reaction is so energetically favorable 
that the enzyme will not work in reverse. 
to produce fructose 6-phosphate in 
gluconeogenesis, the enzyme fructose 
1,6-bisphosphatase removes the 
phosphate from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. 
coordinated feedback regulation of these 
two enzymes helps control the flow of 
metabolites toward glucose synthesis or 
glucose breakdown.

the binding of a variety of metabolites, which provide both positive and 
negative feedback regulation. The enzyme is activated by byproducts of 
ATP hydrolysis—including ADP, AMP, and inorganic phosphate—and it is 
inhibited by ATP. Thus, when ATP is depleted and its metabolic byproducts 
accumulate,  phosphofructokinase  is  turned  on  and  glycolysis  proceeds 
to generate ATP; when ATP is abundant, the enzyme is turned off and 
glycolysis shuts down. The enzyme that catalyzes the reverse reaction, 
fructose 1, 6–bisphosphatase (see Figure 13–21), is regulated by the same 
molecules  but  in  the  opposite  direction.  Thus  this  enzyme  is  activated 
when  phosphofructokinase  is  turned  off,  allowing  gluconeogenesis  to 
proceed.  Many  such  coordinated  regulatory  mechanisms  enable  a  cell 
to respond rapidly to changing conditions and to adjust its metabolism 
accordingly.

Some of the biosynthetic bypass reactions required for gluconeogenesis 
are  energetically  costly.  Production  of  a  single  molecule  of  glucose  by 
gluconeogenesis consumes four molecules of ATP and two molecules of 
GTP. Thus a cell must tightly regulate the balance between glycolysis and 
gluconeogenesis. If both processes were to proceed simultaneously, they 
would shuttle metabolites back and forth in a futile cycle that would con-
sume large amounts of energy and generate heat for no purpose.

Cells store food molecules in special reservoirs to 
Prepare for Periods of need
As  we  have  seen,  gluconeogenesis  is  a  costly  process,  requiring  sub-
stantial amounts of energy from the hydrolysis of ATP and GTP. During 
periods  when  food  is  scarce,  this  expensive  way  of  producing  glucose 
is suppressed if alternatives are available. Thus fasting cells can mobi-
lize glucose that has been stored in the form of glycogen, a branched 
polymer of glucose (Figure 13–22a and see Panel 2–3, pp. 70–71). This 
large polysaccharide is stored as small granules in the cytoplasm of many 
animal cells, but mainly in liver and muscle cells (Figure 13–22B). The 
synthesis and degradation of glycogen occur by separate metabolic path-
ways, which can be rapidly and coordinately regulated according to need. 
When more ATP is needed than can be generated from food molecules 
taken in from the bloodstream, cells break down glycogen in a reaction 
that  is  catalyzed  by  the  enzyme  glycogen  phosphorylase.  This  enzyme 
produces  glucose  1-phosphate,  which  is  then  converted  to  the  glucose 
6-phosphate that feeds into the glycolytic pathway (Figure 13–22C). 

The  glycogen  synthetic  and  degradative  pathways  are  coordinated  by 
feedback regulation. Enzymes in each pathway are allosterically regulated 
by glucose 6-phosphate, but in opposite directions: glycogen synthetase in 
the synthetic pathway is activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas gly-
cogen phosphorylase, which breaks down glycogen (see Figure 13–22C), 
is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate, as well as by ATP. This regulation

helps to prevent glycogen breakdown when ATP is plentiful and to favor

balance between glycogen synthesis and breakdown is further regulated 
by intracellular signaling pathways that are controlled by the hormones

Quantitatively, fat is a far more important storage material than glyco-
gen, in part because the oxidation of a gram of fat releases about twice 
as much energy as the oxidation of a gram of glycogen. Moreover, gly-
cogen binds a great deal of water, producing a sixfold difference in the 
actual mass of glycogen required to store the same amount of energy as 
fat.  An  average  adult  human  stores  enough  glycogen  for  only  about  a 
day of normal activity, but enough fat to last nearly a month. If our main 
fuel reserves had to be carried as glycogen instead of fat, body weight 
would need to be increased by an average of about 60 pounds (nearly 30 
kilograms).

Most of our fat is stored as droplets of water-insoluble triacylglycerols in 
specialized fat cells called adipocytes (Figure 13–23 and see Figure 13–11 
A and B). In response to hormonal signals, fatty acids can be released 
from these depots into the bloodstream for other cells to use as required. 
Such a need arises after a period of not eating. Even a normal overnight 
fast results in the mobilization of fat: in the morning, most of the acetyl 
CoA that enters the citric acid cycle is derived from fatty acids rather than 
from glucose. After a meal, however, most of the acetyl CoA entering the 
citric acid cycle comes from glucose derived from food, and any excess

after looking at the structures of 
sugars and fatty acids (discussed 
in Chapter 2), give an intuitive 
explanation as to why oxidation of 
a sugar yields only about half as 
much energy as the oxidation of an 
equivalent dry weight of a fatty acid.

glucose is used to make glycogen or fat. (Although animal cells can read-
ily convert sugars to fats, they cannot convert fatty acids to sugars.)

The  food  reserves  in  both  animals  and  plants  form  a  vital  part  of  the 
human diet. Plants convert some of the sugars they make through pho-
tosynthesis during daylight into fats and into starch, a branched polymer 
of glucose very similar to animal glycogen. The fats in plants are triacyl-
glycerols, as they are in animals, and they differ only in the types of fatty 
acids that predominate (see Figures 2–19 and 2–20). 

ECB4 e13.23/13.24

The embryo inside a plant seed must live on stored food reserves for a 
long time, until the seed germinates to produce a plant with leaves that 
can harvest the energy in sunlight. The embryo uses these food stores as 
sources of energy and of small molecules to build cell walls and to syn-
thesize many other biological molecules as it develops. For this reason, 
plant seeds often contain especially large amounts of fats and starch—
which make them a major food source for animals, including ourselves 
(Figure 13–24). Germinating seeds convert the stored fat and starch into 
glucose as needed.

In plant cells, fats and starch are both stored in chloroplasts—specialized 
organelles  that  carry  out  photosynthesis  (Figure  13–25).  These  energy-
rich  molecules  serve  as  food  reservoirs  that  are  mobilized  by  the  cell 
to produce ATP in mitochondria during periods of darkness. In the next 
chapter,  we  take  a  closer  look  at  chloroplasts  and  mitochondria,  and 
review  the  elaborate  mechanisms  by  which  they  harvest  energy  from 
sunlight and from food.

THE EVOLUTION OF ENERGY-

Energy Generation in 
Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

The fundamental need to generate energy efficiently has had a profound 
influence on the history of life on Earth. Much of the structure, function, 
and  evolution  of  cells  and  organisms  can  be  related  to  their  need  for 
energy. With no oxygen in the atmosphere, it is thought that the earliest 
cells may have produced ATP by breaking down organic molecules that 
had been generated by geochemical processes. Such fermentation reac-
tions, discussed in Chapter 13, occur in the cytosol of present-day cells, 
where they use the energy derived from the partial oxidation of energy-
rich food molecules to form ATP.

But early in the history of life, a much more efficient mechanism for gener-
ating energy and synthesizing ATP appeared—one based on the transport 
of  electrons  along  membranes.  Billions  of  years  later,  this  mechanism 
is  so  central  to  the  survival  of  life  on  Earth  that  we  devote  this  entire 
chapter to it. As we will see, membrane-based electron-transport mecha-
nisms are used by cells to extract energy from a wide variety of sources. 
These mechanisms are central to both the conversion of light energy into 
chemical-bond energy in photosynthesis and to the generation of large 
amounts of ATP from food molecules during cell respiration. Although 
membrane-based electron transport first appeared in bacteria more than 
3 billion years ago, the descendants of these pioneering cells now crowd 
every  corner  and  crevice  of  our  planet’s  land  and  oceans  with  a  wild 
menagerie of living forms. Perhaps even more remarkably, remnants of 
these bacteria survive within every living eukaryotic cell in the form of 
chloroplasts and mitochondria.

In this chapter, we consider the molecular mechanisms by which elec-
tron transport enables cells to generate the energy they need to survive.

mechanisms use the energy provided 
by food or sunlight to generate aTp. In 
oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in 
mitochondria, an electron-transport system 
uses energy derived from the oxidation of 
food to generate a proton (h+) gradient 
across a membrane. In photosynthesis, 
which occurs in chloroplasts, an electron-
transport system uses energy derived from 
the sun to generate a proton gradient 
across a membrane. In both cases, this 
proton gradient is then used to drive atp 
synthesis.

electrons to release large amounts of energy. Finally, we trace the evolu-
tionary pathways that gave rise to these mechanisms. 

ECB4 m14.02/14.01

But first, we take a brief look at the general principles central to the gen-
eration of energy in all living things: the use of a membrane to harness 
the energy of moving electrons. 

Cells Obtain Most of Their Energy by a Membrane-based 
Mechanism
The  main  chemical  energy  currency  in  cells  is  ATP  (see  Figure  3–32). 
Small amounts of ATP are generated during glycolysis in the cytosol of all 
cells (discussed in Chapter 13). But for the majority of cells, most of their 
ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation. The generation of ATP by 
oxidative phosphorylation differs from the way ATP is produced during 
glycolysis, in that it requires a membrane. In eukaryotic cells, oxidative 
phosphorylation takes place in mitochondria, and it depends on an elec-
tron-transport  process  that  drives  the  transport  of  protons  (H+)  across 
the inner mitochondrial membrane. A related membrane-based process 
produces ATP during photosynthesis in plants, algae, and photosynthetic 
bacteria (figure 14–1).

This  membrane-based  process  for  making  ATP  consists  of  two  linked 
stages: one sets up an electrochemical proton gradient, the other uses 
that gradient to generate ATP. Both stages are carried out by special pro-
tein complexes in the membrane. 

1.  In  Stage  1,  high-energy  electrons  derived  from  the  oxidation  of 
food molecules (discussed in Chapter 13), from sunlight, or from 
other  sources  (discussed  later)  are  transferred  along  a  series  of 
electron carriers—called an electron-transport chain—embedded 
in the membrane. These electron transfers release energy that is 
used to pump protons, derived from the water that is ubiquitous in 
cells, across the membrane and thus generate an electrochemical 
proton  gradient  (figure  14–2a).  An  ion  gradient  across  a  mem-
brane is a form of stored energy that can be harnessed to do useful 
work when the ions are allowed to flow back across the membrane 
down their electrochemical gradient (discussed in Chapter 12).

2.  In Stage 2 of oxidative phosphorylation, protons flow back down 
their  electrochemical  gradient  through  a  protein  complex  called 
ATP  synthase,  which  catalyzes  the  energy-requiring  synthesis 
of  ATP  from  ADP  and  inorganic  phosphate  (Pi).  This  ubiquitous 
enzyme functions like a turbine, permitting the proton gradient to 
drive the production of ATP (figure 14–2B).

When it was first proposed in 1961, this mechanism for generating energy 
was called the chemiosmotic hypothesis, because it linked the chemical 
bond-forming  reactions  that  synthesize  ATP  (“chemi-”)  with  the  mem-
brane transport processes that pump protons (“osmotic,” from the Greek 
osmos, “to push”). Thanks to this chemiosmotic mechanism, now known 
as  chemiosmotic  coupling,  cells  can  harness  the  energy  of  electron 
transfers in much the same way that the energy stored in a battery can be 
harnessed to do useful work (figure 14–3).

ECB4 m14.03/14.02

Chemiosmotic Coupling is an Ancient Process, Preserved 
in Present-Day Cells
The membrane-based, chemiosmotic mechanism for making ATP arose 
very early in life’s history. The exact same type of ATP-generating proc-
esses occur in the plasma membrane of modern bacteria and archaea. 
Apparently, the mechanism was so successful that its essential features 
have been retained in the long evolutionary journey from early prokaryo-
tes to present-day cells. 

This  remarkable  resemblance  can  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  fact  that 
the  organelles  that  produce  ATP  in  eukaryotic  cells—the  chloroplasts 
and mitochondria—evolved from bacteria that were engulfed by ances-
tral cells more than a billion years ago (see Figures 1–18 and 1–20). As 
evidence of their bacterial ancestry, both chloroplasts and mitochondria 
reproduce in a manner similar to that of most prokaryotes (figure 14–4). 

figure 14–3 Batteries can use the energy of electron transfer to 
perform work. (a) If a battery’s terminals are directly connected to 
each other, the energy released by electron transfer is all converted 
into heat. (B) If the battery is connected to a pump, much of the 
energy released by electron transfers can be harnessed to do work 
instead (in this case, to pump water). cells can similarly harness the 
energy of electron transfer to do work—for example, pumping h+ 
(see Figure 14–2a).

figure 14–2 Membrane-based 
systems use the energy stored in an 
electrochemical proton gradient to 
synthesize aTp. the process occurs in 
two stages. (a) In the first stage, a proton 
pump harnesses the energy of electron 
transfer (details not shown here) to pump 
protons (h+) derived from water, creating a 
proton gradient across the membrane. the 
blue arrow shows the direction of electron 
movement. these high-energy electrons 
can come from organic or inorganic 
molecules, or they can be produced by the 
action of light on special molecules such 
as chlorophyll. (B) the proton gradient 
produced in (a) serves as a versatile 
energy store. It is used to drive a variety of 
energy-requiring reactions in mitochondria, 
chloroplasts, and prokaryotes—including 
the synthesis of atp by an atp synthase. 

QUESTION 14–1

Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a small 
molecule that renders membranes 
permeable to protons. In the 
1940s, small amounts of this highly 
toxic compound were given to 
patients to induce weight loss. 
DNP was effective in melting away 
the pounds, especially promoting 
the loss of fat reserves. Can you 
explain how it might cause such 
loss? As an unpleasant side reaction, 
however, patients had an elevated 
temperature and sweated profusely 
during the treatment. Provide an 
explanation for these symptoms.

They also harbor bacterial-like biosynthetic machinery for making RNA 
and  proteins,  and  they  retain  their  own  genomes  (figure  14–5).  Many

Although mitochondria and chloroplasts still contain DNA, the bacteria 
that gave rise to these organelles gave up many of the genes required for 
independent living as they developed the symbiotic relationships that led 
to  the  evolution  of  eukaryotic  animal  and  plant  cells.  These  jettisoned 
genes were not lost, however; many moved to the cell nucleus, where 
they  continue  to  direct  the  production  of  proteins  that  mitochondria 
and chloroplasts import to carry out their specialized functions—includ-
ing the generation of ATP, a process we discuss in detail throughout the 
remainder of the chapter.

MITOCHONDRIA AND OXIDATIVE 
PHOSPHORYLATION
Mitochondria are present in nearly all eukaryotic cells, where they pro-
duce the bulk of the cell’s ATP. Without mitochondria, eukaryotes would 
have  to  rely  on  the  relatively  inefficient  process  of  glycolysis  for  all  of 
their ATP production. When glucose is converted to pyruvate by glyco-
lysis in the cytosol, the net result is that only two molecules of ATP are 
produced per glucose molecule, which is less than 10% of the total free 
energy potentially available from oxidizing the sugar. By contrast, about 
30 molecules of ATP are produced when mitochondria are recruited to 
complete the oxidation of glucose that begins in glycolysis. Had ances-
tral cells not established the relationship with the bacteria that gave rise 
to  modern  mitochondria,  it  seems  unlikely  that  complex  multicellular 
organisms could have evolved. 

The importance of mitochondria is further highlighted by the dire con-
sequences of mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, patients with an 
inherited disorder called myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fiber disease 
(MERRF ) are deficient in multiple proteins required for electron transport. 
As a result, they typically experience muscle weakness, heart problems, 
epilepsy, and often dementia. Muscle and nerve cells are especially sensi-
tive to mitochondrial defects, because they need so much ATP to function 
normally.

In  this  section,  we  review  the  structure  and  function  of  mitochondria. 
We outline how this organelle makes use of an electron-transport chain, 
embedded in its inner membrane, to generate the proton gradient needed 
to drive the synthesis of ATP. And we consider the overall efficiency with 
which this membrane-based system converts the energy stored in food 
molecules into the energy contained in the phosphate bonds of ATP. 

Mitochondria Can Change Their Shape, Location, and 
Number to Suit a Cell’s Needs
Isolated  mitochondria  are  generally  similar  in  size  and  shape  to  their 
bacterial ancestors. Although they are no longer capable of living inde-
pendently, mitochondria are remarkably adaptable and can adjust their 
location, shape, and number to suit the needs of the cell. In some cells, 
mitochondria  remain  fixed  in  one  location,  where  they  supply  ATP 
directly to a site of unusually high energy consumption. In a heart muscle 
cell, for example, mitochondria are located close to the contractile appa-
ratus,  whereas  in  a  sperm  they  are  wrapped  tightly  around  the  motile 
flagellum (figure 14–6). In other cells, mitochondria fuse to form elon-
gated, dynamic tubular networks, which are diffusely distributed through

breaking apart by fission (see Figure 14–4) and fusing again.

Mitochondria are present in large numbers—1000 to 2000 in a liver cell, 
for example. But their numbers vary depending on the cell type and can 
change  with  the  energy  needs  of  the  cell.  In  skeletal  muscle  cells,  for 
example, mitochondria can divide until their numbers increase five- to 
tenfold if the muscle has been repeatedly stimulated to contract. 

ECB4 n14.100/14.06

Regardless of their varied appearance, location, and number, however, 
all mitochondria have the same basic internal structure—a design that 
supports the efficient production of ATP, as we see next. 

A Mitochondrion Contains an Outer Membrane, an Inner 
Membrane, and Two Internal Compartments
An individual mitochondrion is bounded by two highly specialized mem-
branes—one surrounding the other. These membranes, called the outer 
and inner mitochondrial membranes, create two mitochondrial compart-
ments:  a  large  internal  space  called  the  matrix  and  a  much  narrower 
intermembrane space (figure 14–8). When purified mitochondria are gen-
tly  fractionated  into  separate  components  and  their  contents  analyzed 
(see Panel 4–3, pp. 164–165), each of the membranes, and the spaces they 
enclose, are found to contain a unique collection of proteins.

The  outer  membrane  contains  many  molecules  of  a  transport  protein 
called porin, which, forms wide aqueous channels through the lipid bilayer 
(described in Chapter 11). As a result, the outer membrane is like a sieve 
that is permeable to all molecules of 5000 daltons or less, including small 
proteins. This makes the intermembrane space chemically equivalent to 
the cytosol with respect to the small molecules and inorganic ions it con-
tains. In contrast, the inner membrane, like other membranes in the cell, 
is impermeable to the passage of ions and most small molecules, except 
where a path is provided by specific membrane transport proteins. The 
mitochondrial matrix therefore contains only molecules that are selec-
tively transported into the matrix across the inner membrane, and so its 
contents are highly specialized.

The  inner  mitochondrial  membrane  is  the  site  of  oxidative  phosphor-
ylation, and it contains the proteins of the electron-transport chain, the 
proton pumps, and the ATP synthase required for ATP production. It also 
contains a variety of transport proteins that allow the entry of selected 
small molecules—such as pyruvate and fatty acids that will be oxidized 
by the mitochondrion—into the matrix.

Mitochondria and Oxidative phosphorylation

Matrix. This space contains a highly 
concentrated mixture of hundreds of 
enzymes, including those required for 
the oxidation of pyruvate and fatty 
acids and for the citric acid cycle. 
 
Inner membrane. Folded into 
numerous cristae, the inner 
membrane contains proteins that carry 
out oxidative phosphorylation, including 
the electron-transport chain and the 
ATP synthase that makes ATP.
 
Outer membrane. Because it contains 
large channel-forming proteins (called 
porins), the outer membrane is 
permeable to all molecules of 5000 
daltons or less. 
 
Intermembrane space. This space 
contains several enzymes that use the 
ATP passing out of the matrix to 
phosphorylate other nucleotides. It also 
contains proteins that are released 
during apoptosis (discussed in 
Chapter 18).

The  inner  membrane  is  highly  convoluted,  forming  a  series  of  infold-
ings—known  as  cristae—that  project  into  the  matrix  space  (see  Figure 
14–8 and Movie 14.1). These folds greatly increase the surface area of 
the membrane. In a liver cell, for example, the inner membranes of all 
the mitochondria make up about one-third of the total membranes of the 
cell. And the number of cristae in a mitochondrion of a cardiac muscle 
cell is three times greater than that in a mitochondrion from a liver cell.

ECB4 e14.04/14.07

The Citric Acid Cycle Generates the High-Energy Electrons 
Required for ATP Production 
The  generation  of  ATP  is  powered  by  the  flow  of  electrons  that  are 
derived from the burning of carbohydrates, fats, and other foodstuffs dur-
ing glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (discussed in Chapter 13). These 
high-energy electrons are provided by activated carriers generated dur-
ing these two stages of catabolism, with the majority being churned out 
by the citric acid cycle that operates in the mitochondrial matrix. 

The citric acid cycle gets the fuel it needs to produce these activated car-
riers from food-derived molecules that make their way into mitochondria 
from the cytosol. Both the pyruvate produced by glycolysis, which takes 
place in the cytosol, and the fatty acids derived from the breakdown of 
fats (see Figure 13–3) can enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space 
through the porins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. These fuel mol-
ecules  are  then  transported  across  the  inner  mitochondrial  membrane 
into the matrix, where they are converted into the crucial metabolic inter-
mediate, acetyl CoA (figure 14–9). The acetyl groups in acetyl CoA are

membrane, and 6% in the intermembrane

then oxidized to CO2 via the citric acid cycle (see Figure 13–12). Some 
of the energy derived from this oxidation is saved in the form of high-
energy electrons, held by the activated carriers NADH and FADH2. These 
activated  carriers  can  then  donate  their  high-energy  electrons  to  the 
electron-transport  chain  in  the  inner  mitochondrial  membrane  (figure 
14–10). 

ECB4 e14.05/14.08

The Movement of Electrons is Coupled to the Pumping of 
Protons
The  chemiosmotic  generation  of  energy  begins  when  the  activated 
carriers  NADH  and  FADH2  donate  their  high-energy  electrons  to  the 
electron-transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, becom-
ing  oxidized  to  NAD+  and  FAD  in  the  process  (see  Figure  14–10).  The 
electrons are quickly passed along the chain to molecular oxygen (O2) 
to form water (H2O). The stepwise movement of these high-energy elec-
trons through the components of the electron-transport chain releases 
energy  that  can  then  be  used  to  pump  protons  across  the  inner  mem-
brane  (figure  14–11).  The  resulting  proton  gradient,  in  turn,  is  used 
to  drive  the  synthesis  of  ATP.  The  full  sequence  of  reactions  is  shown 
in  figure  14–12.  The  inner  mitochondrial  membrane  thus  serves  as  a 
device that converts the energy contained in the high-energy electrons 
of NADH (and FADH2) into the phosphate bond of ATP molecules (figure 
14–13). This chemiosmotic mechanism for ATP synthesis is called oxida-
tive phosphorylation, because it involves both the consumption of O2 
and the addition of a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. 

The source of the high-energy electrons that power the proton pumping 
differs  widely  between  different  organisms  and  different  processes.  In 
cell  respiration—which  takes  place  in  both  mitochondria  and  aerobic 
bacteria—the high-energy electrons are ultimately derived from sugars

During oxidative phosphorylation, high-
energy electrons donated by NaDh (and 
FaDh2) are then passed along the electron-
transport chain in the inner membrane 
to oxygen (O2); this electron transport 
generates a proton gradient across the

production of atp by atp synthase. the 
exact ratios of “reactants” and “products”

or  fats.  In  photosynthesis,  the  high-energy  electrons  come  from  the 
organic green pigment chlorophyll, which captures energy from sunlight. 
And many single-celled organisms (archaea and bacteria) use inorganic 
substances such as hydrogen, iron, and sulfur as the source of the high-
energy electrons that they need to make ATP (see, for example, Figure 
1–12). 

ECB4 m14.09/14.10

Regardless of the electron source, the vast majority of living organisms 
use a chemiosmotic mechanism to generate ATP. In the following sec-
tions, we describe in detail how this process occurs.

Protons Are Pumped Across the Inner Mitochondrial 
Membrane by Proteins in the Electron-Transport Chain
The  electron-transport  chain—or  respiratory  chain—that  carries  out 
oxidative phosphorylation is present in many copies in the inner mito-
chondrial membrane. Each chain contains over 40 proteins, grouped into 
three large respiratory enzyme complexes. These complexes each con-
tain multiple individual proteins, including transmembrane proteins that 
anchor the complex firmly in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The  three  respiratory  enzyme  complexes,  in  the  order  in  which  they 
receive electrons, are: (1) NADH dehydrogenase complex, (2) cytochrome c 
reductase complex, and (3) cytochrome c oxidase complex (figure 14–14). 
Each  complex  contains  metal  ions  and  other  chemical  groups  that  act 
as stepping stones to facilitate the passage of electrons. The movement 
of electrons through these respiratory complexes is accompanied by the 
pumping of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane 
space. Thus each complex can be thought of as a proton pump.

electrons from NaDh to oxygen (blue lines), 
protons derived from water are pumped 
across the membrane from the matrix 
into the intermembrane space by each of 
the complexes (Movie 14.2). Ubiquinone 
(Q) and cytochrome c (c) serve as mobile 
carriers that ferry electrons from one 
complex to the next.

The first respiratory complex in the chain, NADH dehydrogenase, accepts 
electrons from NADH. These electrons are extracted from NADH in the 
form of a hydride ion (H–), which is then converted into a proton and two 
high-energy electrons. That reaction, H– → H+ + 2e– (see Figure 14–10), is 
catalyzed by the NADH dehydrogenase complex. The electrons are then 
passed along the chain to each of the other enzyme complexes in turn, 
using mobile electron carriers to ferry electrons between complexes (see 
Figure  14–14).  This  transfer  of  electrons  is  energetically  favorable:  the 
electrons are passed from electron carriers with weaker electron affinity 
to those with stronger electron affinity, until they combine with a mol-
ecule of O2 to form water. This final reaction is the only oxygen-requiring 
step in cell respiration, and it consumes nearly all of the oxygen that we 
breathe.

Proton Pumping Produces a Steep Electrochemical Proton 
Gradient Across the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane
Without  a  mechanism  for  harnessing  the  energy  released  by  the  ener-
getically  favorable  transfer  of  electrons  from  NADH  to  O2,  this  energy 
would simply be liberated as heat. Cells are able to recover much of this 
energy because the three respiratory enzyme complexes in the electron-
transport  chain  use  it  to  pump  protons  across  the  inner  mitochondrial 
membrane,  from  the  matrix  into  the  intermembrane  space  (see  Figure 
14–14).  Later,  we  will  outline  the  molecular  mechanisms  involved.  For 
now,  we  focus  on  the  consequences  of  this  nifty  maneuver.  First,  the 
pumping of protons generates a H+ gradient—or pH gradient—across the 
inner membrane. As a result, the pH in the matrix (around 7.9) is about 
0.7 unit higher than it is in the intermembrane space (which is 7.2, the 
same  pH  as  the  cytosol).  Second,  proton  pumping  generates  a  voltage 
gradient—or  membrane  potential—across  the  inner  membrane;  as  H+ 
flows outward, the matrix side of the membrane becomes negative and 
the side facing the intermembrane space becomes positive.

As discussed in Chapter 12, the force that drives the passive flow of an ion 
across a membrane is proportional to the ion’s electrochemical gradient. 
The strength of that electrochemical gradient depends both on the volt-
age across the membrane, as measured by the membrane potential, and 
on the ion’s concentration gradient (see Figure 12–5). Because protons 
are positively charged, they will more readily cross a membrane if there 
is an excess of negative charge on the other side. In the case of the inner 
mitochondrial membrane, the pH gradient and membrane potential work

Both forces combine to generate the 
proton-motive force, which pulls h+ back 
into the mitochondrial matrix. the exact, 
mathematical relationship between these 
forces is expressed by the Nernst equation

together to create a steep electrochemical proton gradient that makes it 
energetically  very  favorable  for  H+  to  flow  back  into  the  mitochondrial 
matrix. The membrane potential contributes significantly to this proton-
motive force, which pulls H+ back across the membrane; the greater the 
membrane  potential,  the  more  energy  is  stored  in  the  proton  gradient 
(figure 14–15).

ATP Synthase Uses the Energy Stored in the 
Electrochemical Proton Gradient to Produce ATP 
If protons in the intermembrane space were allowed simply to flow back 
into  the  mitochondrial  matrix,  the  energy  stored  in  the  electrochemi-
cal  proton  gradient  would  be  lost  as  heat.  Such  a  seemingly  wasteful 
process allows hibernating bears to stay warm, as we discuss further in 
How We Know (pp. 462–463). In most cells, however, the electrochemi-
cal proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is used to 
drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi (see Figure 2–25). The device 
that makes this possible is ATP synthase, a large, multisubunit protein 
embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

ATP synthase is of ancient origin; the same enzyme generates ATP in the 
mitochondria of animal cells, the chloroplasts of plants and algae, and 
the plasma membrane of bacteria. The part of the protein that catalyzes 
the phosphorylation of ADP is shaped like a lollipop head and projects 
into the mitochondrial matrix; it is attached by a central stalk to a trans-
membrane H+ carrier (figure 14–16). The passage of protons through the 
carrier causes the carrier and its stalk to spin rapidly, like a tiny motor. As 
the stalk rotates, it rubs against proteins in the stationary head, altering 
their conformation and prompting them to produce ATP. In this way, a 
mechanical deformation gets converted into the chemical-bond energy 
of ATP (Movie 14.3). This fine-tuned sequence of interactions allows ATP 
synthase to produce more than 100 molecules of ATP per second—3 mol-
ecules of ATP per revolution. 

ATP  synthase  can  also  operate  in  reverse—using  the  energy  of  ATP 
hydrolysis  to  pump  protons  “uphill,”  against  their  electrochemical  gra-
dient across the membrane (figure 14–17). In this mode, ATP synthase 
functions like the H+ pumps described in Chapter 12. Whether ATP syn-
thase primarily makes ATP—or consumes it to pump protons—depends 
on  the  magnitude  of  the  electrochemical  proton  gradient  across  the 
membrane in which the enzyme is embedded. In many bacteria that can 
grow either aerobically or anaerobically, the direction in which the ATP

(a) the multisubunit protein is

of the transmembrane h+ carrier (blue)

rapidly within the stationary head of

generate atp from aDp and pi. the 
stationary head is secured to the inner

“arm” called the peripheral stalk

Under these conditions, the ATP synthase uses some of the ATP gener-

the proton gradient that the bacterial cell needs to import its essential 
nutrients by coupled transport. A similar mechanism is used to drive the 
transport of small molecules in and out of the mitochondrial matrix, as 
we discuss next.

atp by harnessing the electrochemical h+ gradient (a) or pump protons against 
this gradient by hydrolyzing atp (B). the direction of operation at any given instant 
depends on the net free-energy change (∆G, discussed in chapter 3) for the coupled 
processes of h+ translocation across the membrane and the synthesis of atp from 
aDp and pi. For example, if the electrochemical proton gradient falls below a certain 
level, the ∆G for h+ transport into the matrix will no longer be large enough to drive 
atp production; instead, atp will be hydrolyzed by the atp synthase to rebuild the 
proton gradient. a tribute to the activity of atp synthase is shown in Movie 14.4.

Coupled Transport Across the Inner Mitochondrial 
Membrane Is Also Driven by the Electrochemical  
Proton Gradient
The synthesis of ATP is not the only process driven by the electrochemical 
proton gradient in mitochondria. Many small, charged molecules, such 
as  pyruvate,  ADP,  and  inorganic  phosphate  (Pi),  are  imported  into  the 
mitochondrial matrix from the cytosol, while others, such as ATP, must 
be transported in the opposite direction. Carrier proteins that bind these 
molecules can couple their transport to the energetically favorable flow 
of  H+  into  the  matrix  (see  the  “coupled  transporters”  in  Figure  12–14). 
Pyruvate and Pi, for example, are each co-transported inward along with 
protons, as the protons move down their electrochemical gradient into 
the matrix. 

Other transporters take advantage of the membrane potential generated 
by the electrochemical proton gradient, which makes the matrix side of 
the inner mitochondrial membrane more negatively charged than the side 
that faces the intermembrane space. An antiport carrier protein exploits 
this voltage gradient to export ATP from the mitochondrial matrix and to 
bring ADP in. This exchange allows the ATP synthesized in the mitochon-
drion to be exported rapidly (figure 14–18). 

In eukaryotic cells, therefore, the electrochemical proton gradient is used 
to drive both the formation of ATP and the transport of selected metabo-
lites across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In bacteria, the proton 
gradient  across  the  plasma  membrane  is  similarly  used  to  drive  ATP 
synthesis  and  metabolite  transport.  But  it  also  serves  as  an  important 
source of directly usable energy: in motile bacteria, for instance, the flow 
of protons into the cell drives the rapid rotation of the bacterial flagellum, 
which propels the bacterium along (Movie 14.5).

The Rapid Conversion of ADP to ATP in Mitochondria 
Maintains a High ATP/ADP Ratio in Cells
As a result of the nucleotide exchange shown in Figure 14–18, ADP mol-
ecules—produced by hydrolysis of ATP in the cytosol—are rapidly drawn 
back into mitochondria for recharging, while the bulk of the ATP mole-
cules produced in mitochondria are exported into the cytosol, where they 
are most needed. (A small amount of ATP is used within mitochondria

QUESTION 14–4

The remarkable properties that 
allow ATP synthase to run in either 
direction allow the interconversion 
of energy stored in the H+ gradient 
and energy stored in ATP to proceed 
in either direction. (A) If ATP 
synthase making ATP can be likened 
to a water-driven turbine producing 
electricity, what would be an 
appropriate analogy when it works 
in the opposite direction? (B) Under 
what conditions would one expect 
the ATP synthase to stall, running 
neither forward nor backward?  
(C) What determines the direction in 
which the ATP synthase operates?

figure 14–18 The electrochemical proton 
gradient across the inner mitochondrial 
membrane is used to drive some coupled 
transport processes. the charge on each 
of the transported molecules is indicated for 
comparison with the membrane potential, 
which is negative inside, as shown. pyruvate 
and inorganic phosphate (pi) are moved 
into the matrix along with protons, as the 
protons move down their electrochemical 
gradient. Both are negatively charged, 
so their movement is opposed by the 
negative membrane potential; however, 
the h+ concentration gradient—the ph 
gradient—is harnessed in a way that 
nevertheless drives their inward transport. 
aDp is pumped into the matrix and atp 
is pumped out by an antiport process 
that uses the voltage gradient across the 
membrane to drive this exchange. the 
outer mitochondrial membrane is freely 
permeable to all of these compounds due 
to the presence of porins in the membrane 
(not shown). the active transport of 
molecules across membranes by carrier 
proteins and the generation of a membrane 
potential are discussed in chapter 12.

ChapTER 14     energy Generation in Mitochondria and chloroplasts

themselves  to  power  DNA  replication,  protein  synthesis,  and  other 
energy-consuming  reactions  that  occur  there.)  With  all  of  this  back-
and-forth, a typical ATP molecule in a human cell will shuttle out of a 
mitochondrion and back in (as ADP) more than once every minute.

As discussed in Chapter 3, most biosynthetic enzymes drive energetically 
unfavorable  reactions  by  coupling  them  to  the  energetically  favorable 
hydrolysis  of  ATP  (see  Figure  3–33A).  The  pool  of  ATP  in  a  cell  is  thus 
used to drive a huge variety of cell processes in much the same way that 
a battery is used to drive an electric engine. To be useful in this way, the 
concentration of ATP in the cytosol must be kept about 10 times higher 
than that of ADP. If the activity of mitochondria were halted, ATP levels 
would fall dramatically and the cell’s battery would run down. Eventually, 
energetically unfavorable reactions could no longer take place and the 
cell  would  die.  The  poison  cyanide,  which  blocks  electron  transport  in 
the inner mitochondrial membrane, causes cell death in exactly this way.

Cell Respiration Is Amazingly Efficient
The oxidation of sugars to produce ATP may seem unnecessarily com-
plex. Surely the process could be accomplished more directly—perhaps 
by eliminating the citric acid cycle or some of the steps in the respiratory 
chain. Such simplification would certainly make the chemistry easier for 
students  to  learn—but  it  would  be  bad  news  for  the  cell.  As  discussed 
in Chapter 13, the oxidative pathways that allow cells to extract energy 
from food efficiently and in a usable form involve many intermediates, 
each  differing  only  slightly  from  its  predecessor.  In  this  way,  the  huge 
amounts of energy locked up in food molecules can be parceled out into 
small packets that can be captured in activated carriers, such as NADH 
and FADH2 (see Figure 13–1).
Much of the energy carried by NADH and FADH2 is ultimately converted 
into  the  bond  energy  of  ATP.  How  much  ATP  each  of  these  activated 
carriers  can  produce  depends  on  several  factors,  including  where  its 
electrons  enter  the  respiratory  chain.  The  NADH  molecules  produced 
in the mitochondrial matrix during the citric acid cycle pass their high-
energy electrons to the NADH dehydrogenase complex—the first complex 
in the chain. As the electrons pass from one enzyme complex to the next, 
they  promote  the  pumping  of  protons  across  the  inner  mitochondrial 
membrane at each step along the way. In this way, each NADH molecule 
provides enough net energy to generate about 2.5 molecules of ATP (see 
Question 14–5 and its answer).
FADH2 molecules, on the other hand, bypass the NADH dehydrogenase 
complex  and  pass  their  electrons  to  the  membrane-embedded  mobile 
carrier  ubiquinone  (see  Figure  14–14).  Because  these  electrons  enter 
further  down  the  respiratory  chain  than  those  donated  by  NADH,  they 
promote  the  pumping  of  fewer  protons:  each  molecule  of  FADH2  thus 
produces only 1.5 molecules of ATP. Table 14–1 provides a full accounting 
of the ATP produced by the complete oxidation of glucose.
Although the biological oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H2O consists of 
many interdependent steps, the overall process is remarkably efficient. 
Almost 50% of the total energy that could be released by burning sugars 
or fats is captured and stored in the phosphate bonds of ATP during cell 
respiration. That might not seem impressive, but it is considerably bet-
ter than most nonbiological energy-conversion devices. Electric motors 
and  gasoline  engines  operate  at  about  10–20%  efficiency.  If  cells  oper-
ated at this efficiency, an organism would have to eat voraciously just to 
maintain itself. Moreover, because the wasted energy is liberated as heat, 
large organisms (including ourselves) would need far better mechanisms

cells to extract a maximum amount of energy from food.

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ELECTRON 
TRANSPORT AND PROTON PUMPING
For  many  years,  biochemists  struggled  to  understand  why  electron-
transport chains had to be embedded in membranes to function in ATP 
production. The puzzle was essentially solved in the 1960s, when it was 
discovered that transmembrane proton gradients drive the process. The 
concept  of  chemiosmotic  coupling  was  so  novel,  however,  that  it  was 
not widely accepted until many years later, when additional experiments 
with artificial energy-generating systems put the power of proton gradi-
ents to the test (see how We Know, pp. 462–463). 

Although investigators are still unraveling some of the details of chemi-
osmotic coupling at the atomic level, the fundamentals are now clear. In 
this section, we examine the basic principles that drive the movement of 
electrons, and we explain in molecular detail how electron transport can 
generate a proton gradient. Because very similar mechanisms are used 
by mitochondria, chloroplasts, and prokaryotes, these principles apply to 
nearly all living things. 

Protons Are Readily Moved by the Transfer of Electrons
Although protons resemble other positive ions such as Na+ and K+ in the 
way  they  move  across  membranes,  in  some  respects  they  are  unique. 
Hydrogen atoms are by far the most abundant atom in living organisms: 
they are plentiful not only in all carbon-containing biological molecules 
but also in the water molecules that surround them. The protons in water 
are highly mobile: by rapidly dissociating from one water molecule and 
associating with its neighbor, they can rapidly flit through a hydrogen-
bonded  network  of  water  molecules  (see  Figure  2–15B).  Thus  water, 
which is everywhere in cells, serves as a ready reservoir for donating and 
accepting protons.

hOW WE KNOW
hOW ChEMIOSMOTIC COUplING DRIvES aTp SYNThESIS

In 1861, Louis Pasteur discovered that yeast cells grow 
and divide more vigorously when air is present—the first 
demonstration that aerobic metabolism is more efficient 
than  anaerobic  metabolism.  His  observations  make 
sense now that we know that oxidative phosphorylation 
is a much more efficient means of generating ATP than 
is  glycolysis,  producing  about  30  molecules  of  ATP  for 
each molecule of glucose oxidized, compared with the 2 
ATPs generated by glycolysis alone. But it took another 
hundred  years  for  researchers  to  determine  that  it  is 
the  process  of  chemiosmotic  coupling—using  proton 
pumping  to  power  ATP  synthesis—that  allows  cells  to 
generate energy with such efficiency. 

Imaginary intermediates
In  the  1950s,  many  researchers  believed  that  the  oxi-
dative phosphorylation that takes place in mitochondria 
generates ATP via a mechanism similar to that used in 
glycolysis.  During  glycolysis,  ATP  is  produced  when  a 
molecule  of  ADP  receives  a  phosphate  group  directly 
from  a  “high-energy”  intermediate.  Such  substrate-
level  phosphorylation  occurs  in  steps  7  and  10  of 
glycolysis,  where  the  high-energy  phosphate  groups 
from  1,3-bisphosphoglycerate  and  phosphoenolpyru-
vate,  respectively,  are  transferred  to  ADP  to  form  ATP 
(see Panel 13–1, pp. 428–429). It was assumed that the 
electron-transport  chain  in  mitochondria  would  simi-
larly  generate  some  phosphorylated  intermediate  that 
could then donate its phosphate group directly to ADP. 
This  model  inspired  a  long  and  frustrating  search  for 
this mysterious high-energy intermediate. Investigators 
occasionally  claimed  to  have  discovered  the  missing 
intermediate, but the compounds turned out to be either 
unrelated to electron transport or, as one researcher put 
it in a review of the history of bioenergetics, “products of 
high-energy imagination.”

Harnessing the force
It wasn’t until 1961 that Peter Mitchell suggested that the 
“high-energy intermediate” his colleagues were seeking 
was,  in  fact,  the  electrochemical  proton  gradient  gen-
erated  by  the  electron-transport  system.  His  proposal, 
dubbed  the  chemiosmotic  hypothesis,  stated  that  the 
energy  of  an  electrochemical  proton  gradient  formed 
during  the  transfer  of  electrons  through  the  electron-
transport chain could be tapped to drive ATP synthesis.

Several lines of evidence offered support for Mitchell’s 
proposed  mechanism.  First,  mitochondria  do  generate 
an  electrochemical  proton  gradient  across  their  inner 
membrane.  But  what  does  this  gradient—also  called 
the  proton-motive  force—actually  do?  If  the  gradient 
is  required  to  drive  ATP  synthesis,  as  the  chemios-
motic hypothesis posits, then either disrupting the inner 
membrane  or  eliminating  the  proton  gradient  across 
it  should  inhibit  ATP  production.  In  fact,  researchers 
found  both  these  predictions  to  be  true.  Physical  dis-
ruption of the inner mitochondrial membrane halts ATP 
synthesis in that organelle. Similarly, dissipation of the 
proton gradient by a chemical “uncoupling” agent such 
as  2,4-dinitrophenol  (DNP)  also  inhibits  mitochondrial 
ATP production. Such gradient-busting chemicals carry 
H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, forming a 
shuttle system for the movement of H+ that bypasses the 
ATP  synthase  (figure  14–19).  In  this  way,  compounds 
such  as  DNP  uncouple  electron  transport  from  ATP 
synthesis. As a result of this short-circuiting, the proton-
motive force is dissipated completely, and the organelle 
can no longer make ATP.

Such  uncoupling  occurs  naturally  in  some  specialized 
fat  cells.  In  these  cells,  called  brown  fat  cells,  most  of 
the energy from the oxidation of fat is dissipated as heat 
rather  than  converted  into  ATP.  The  inner  membranes

of  the  large  mitochondria  in  these  cells  contain  a  car-
rier  protein  that  allows  protons  to  move  down  their 
electrochemical  gradient,  circumventing  ATP  synthase. 
As  a  result,  the  cells  oxidize  their  fat  stores  at  a  rapid 
rate and produce more heat than ATP. Tissues contain-
ing brown fat serve as biological heating pads, helping to 
revive hibernating animals and to protect sensitive areas 
of  newborn  human  babies  (such  as  the  backs  of  their 
necks) from the cold.

Artificial ATP generation
If disrupting the electrochemical proton gradient across 
the mitochondrial inner membrane terminates ATP syn-
thesis,  then,  conversely,  generating  an  artificial  proton 
gradient  should  stimulate  ATP  synthesis.  Again,  this 
is  exactly  what  happens.  When  a  proton  gradient  is 
imposed artificially by lowering the pH on the outside of 
the mitochondrial inner membrane, out pours ATP.

in Chapter 11, the plasma membrane of this archaean is 
packed with bacteriorhodopsin, a protein that pumps H+ 
out of the cell in response to sunlight (see Figure 11–27). 

When  bacteriorhodopsin  was  reconstituted  into  artifi-
cial  lipid  vesicles  (liposomes),  Racker  and  Stoeckenius 
showed that, in the presence of light, the bacterial protein 
pumps H+ into the vesicles, generating a proton gradient. 
(The orientation of the protein is reversed in these mem-
branes, so that protons are transported into the vesicles; 
in  the  bacterium,  protons  are  pumped  out.)  When  the 
bovine  ATP  synthase  was  then  incorporated  into  these 
vesicles, much to the amazement of many biochemists, 
the system could catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP 
and inorganic phosphate in response to light. This ATP 
formation showed an absolute dependence on an intact 
proton gradient, as either eliminating bacteriorhodopsin 
from  the  system  or  adding  uncoupling  agents  such  as 
DNP abolished ATP synthesis (figure 14–20). 

How does the electrochemical proton gradient drive ATP 
production? This is where the ATP synthase comes in. In 
1974,  Efraim  Racker  and  Walther  Stoeckenius  demon-
strated that they could reconstitute a complete artificial 
ATP-generating  system  by  combining  an  ATP  synthase 
isolated  from  the  mitochondria  of  cow  heart  muscle 
with a proton pump purified from the purple membrane 
of the prokaryote Halobacterium halobium. As discussed 

This  remarkable  experiment  demonstrated  without  a 
doubt  that  a  proton  gradient  could  stimulate  ATP  syn-
thase  to  make  ATP.  Thus,  although  biochemists  had 
initially  hoped  to  discover  a  high-energy  intermediate 
involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the experimental 
evidence  eventually  convinced  them  that  their  search 
was in vain and that the chemiosmotic hypothesis was 
correct. Mitchell was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.

These protons often accompany the electrons that are transferred dur-
ing oxidation and reduction. When a molecule is reduced by acquiring 
an electron (e–), the electron brings with it a negative charge; in many 
cases, this charge is immediately neutralized by the addition of a proton 
from water, so that the net effect of the reduction is to transfer an entire 
hydrogen atom, H+ + e– (figure 14–21a). Similarly, when a molecule is 
oxidized, it often loses an electron from one of its hydrogen atoms: in 
most instances, the electron is transferred to an electron carrier, and the 
proton is passed on to water (figure 14–21B). Therefore, in a membrane 
in which electrons are being passed along an electron-transport chain, 
it  is  a  relatively  simple  matter,  in  principle,  to  move  protons  from  one 
side of the membrane to the other. All that is required is that the electron 
carrier  be  oriented  in  the  membrane  in  such  a  way  that  it  accepts  an 
electron—along with a proton from water—on one side of the membrane, 
and then releases that proton on the other side of the membrane when 
the  electron  is  passed  on  to  the  next  electron  carrier  molecule  in  the 
chain (figure 14–22).

The Redox Potential Is a Measure of Electron Affinities
The  proteins  of  the  respiratory  chain  guide  the  electrons  so  that  they 
move sequentially from one enzyme complex to another—with no short 
circuits that skip a complex. Each electron transfer is an oxidation–reduc-
tion reaction: as described in Chapter 3, the molecule or atom donating 
the  electron  becomes  oxidized,  while  the  receiving  molecule  or  atom 
becomes reduced (see pp. 89–90). Electrons will pass spontaneously from 
molecules  that  have  a  relatively  low  affinity  for  their  outer-shell  elec-
trons, and thus lose them easily, to molecules that have a higher affinity 
for electrons. For example, NADH has a low electron affinity, so that its 
electrons are readily passed to the NADH dehydrogenase complex (see 
Figure 14–14). The batteries we use to power our electronic gadgets are 
based  on  similar  electron  transfers  between  chemical  substances  with 
different electron affinities.

In biochemical reactions, any electrons removed from one molecule are 
always passed to another, so that whenever one molecule is oxidized, 
another is reduced. Like any other chemical reaction, the tendency of such 
oxidation–reduction reactions, or redox reactions, to proceed spontane-
ously depends on the free-energy change (∆G) for the electron transfer, 
which in turn depends on the relative affinities of the two molecules for 
electrons. (The role of free energy in chemical reactions is discussed in 
Chapter 3, pp. 90–100.)

Because electron transfers provide most of the energy in living things, it 
is worth taking time to understand them. Molecules that donate protons 
are known as acids; those that accept protons are called bases (see Panel 
2–2, pp. 68–69). These molecules exist in conjugate acid–base pairs, in 
which the acid is readily converted into the base by the loss of a proton. 
For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is converted into its conjugate base 
(CH3COO–) in the reaction

CH3COOH 

 CH3COO– + H+

figure 14–22 The orientation of a membrane-embedded electron 
carrier allows electron transfer to drive proton pumping. as 
an electron passes along an electron-transport chain, it can bind 
and release a proton at each step. In this schematic diagram, the 
electron carrier, protein B, picks up a proton (h+) from one side of the 
membrane when it accepts an electron (e–) from protein a; protein 
B releases the proton to the other side of the membrane when it 
donates its electron to the electron carrier, protein c. 

Molecular Mechanisms of electron transport and proton pumping         

465

In the same way, pairs of compounds such as NADH and NAD+ are called 
redox pairs, because NADH is converted to NAD+ by the loss of electrons 
in the reaction

NADH 

 NAD+ + H+ + 2e–

NADH is a strong electron donor. Its electrons can be said to be held at 
high-energy because the ∆G for passing them to many other molecules is 
favorable. Conversely, it is difficult to produce the high-energy electrons 
in NADH, so its partner, NAD+, is of necessity a weak electron acceptor.
The tendency for a redox pair such as NADH/NAD+ to donate or accept 
electrons  can  be  determined  experimentally  by  measuring  its  redox 
potential (panel 14–1, p. 466). Electrons will move spontaneously from a 
redox pair with a low redox potential (or low affinity for electrons), such 
as NADH/NAD+, to a redox pair with a high redox potential (or high affin-
ity for electrons), such as O2/H2O. Thus, NADH is an excellent molecule 
to donate electrons to the respiratory chain, while O2 is well suited to act 
as an electron “sink” at the end of the pathway. As explained in Panel 
14–1, the difference in redox potential, ∆E0ʹ, is a direct measure of the 
standard  free-energy  change  (∆G°)  for  the  transfer  of  an  electron  from 
one molecule to another. In fact, ∆E0ʹ is equal to ∆G° times a negative 
number that is a constant.

Electron Transfers Release Large Amounts of Energy
The amount of energy that can be released by an electron transfer can 
be  determined  by  comparing  the  redox  potentials  of  the  molecules 
involved.  Again,  let’s  look  at  the  transfer  of  electrons  from  NADH  and 
to  O2.  As  shown  in  Panel  14–1,  a  1:1  mixture  of  NADH  and  NAD+  has 
a redox potential of –320 mV, indicating that NADH has a weak affinity 
for electrons—and a strong tendency to donate them; a 1:1 mixture of 
H2O and ½O2 has a redox potential of +820 mV, indicating that O2 has 
a  strong  affinity  for  electrons—and  a  strong  tendency  to  accept  them. 
The difference in redox potential between these two pairs is 1.14 volts  
(1140 mV), which means that the transfer of each electron from NADH 
to O2 under these standard conditions is enormously favorable: the ∆G° 
for that electron transfer is –26.2 kcal/mole per electron—or –52.4 kcal/
mole for the two electrons that are donated from each NADH molecule 
(see Panel 14–1). If we compare this free-energy change with that needed 
for the formation of the phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP in cells (about 
13 kcal/mole), we see that enough energy is released by the oxidization 
of one NADH molecule to synthesize a couple of molecules of ATP.

Living systems could have evolved enzymes that would allow NADH to 
donate electrons directly to O2 to make water. But because of the huge 
free-energy  drop,  this  reaction  would  proceed  with  almost  explosive 
force and nearly all of the energy would be released as heat. Instead, as 
we have seen, the transfer of electrons from NADH to O2 is made in many 
small  steps  along  the  electron-transport  chain,  enabling  nearly  half  of 
the released energy to be stored in the proton gradient across the inner 
membrane rather than getting lost to the environment as heat.

Metals Tightly Bound to Proteins Form Versatile Electron 
Carriers
Each of the three respiratory enzyme complexes includes metal atoms 
that are tightly bound to the proteins. Once an electron has been donated 
to  a  respiratory  complex,  it  moves  within  the  complex  by  skipping  
from  one  embedded  metal  ion  to  another  with  a  greater  affinity  for 
electrons.

THE STANDARD REDOX POTENTIAL, E′0

The standard redox potential for a redox pair, 
deﬁned as E0 , is measured for a standard state 
where all of the reactants are at a concentration of 
1 M, including H+. Since biological reactions occur at 
pH 7, biologists instead deﬁne the standard state as 
Areduced = Aoxidized and H+ = 10–7 M. This standard 
redox potential is designated by the symbol E0 , in 
place of E0.

One beaker (left) contains substance A with an equimolar 
mixture of the reduced (Areduced) and oxidized (Aoxidized) 
members of its redox pair. The other beaker contains the 
hydrogen reference standard (2H+ + 2e–      H2), whose redox 
potential is arbitrarily assigned as zero by international 
agreement. (A salt bridge formed from a concentrated KCl 
solution allows K+ and Cl– to move between the beakers; as 
required to neutralize the charges when electrons ﬂow 
between the beakers.) The metal wire (dark blue) provides a 
resistance-free path for electrons, and a voltmeter then 
measures the redox potential of substance A. If electrons ﬂow 
from Areduced to H+, as indicated here, the redox pair formed 
by substance A is said to have a negative redox potential. If 
they instead ﬂow from H2 to Aoxidized, the redox pair is said to 
have a positive redox potential.

EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION CHANGES

As explained in Chapter 3 (see p. 94), the actual free-energy
change for a reaction, ΔG, depends on the concentration of the
reactants and generally will be different from the standard free-
energy change, ΔGo. The standard redox potentials are for a 1:1
mixture of the redox pair. For example, the standard redox
potential of –320 mV is for a 1:1 mixture of NADH and NAD+.
But when there is an excess of NADH over NAD+, electron
transfer from NADH to an electron acceptor becomes more 
favorable. This is reﬂected by a more negative redox potential
and a more negative ΔG for electron transfer.

favorable ΔGo of –18.2 kcal/mole. The ΔGo value for the
transfer of one electron from NADH to oxygen is the
sum of these two values, –26.2 kcal/mole.

When passing from one respiratory complex to the next, in contrast, the 
electrons are ferried by electron carriers that diffuse freely within the lipid 
bilayer. These mobile molecules pick up electrons from one complex and 
deliver them to the next in line. In the mitochondrial respiratory chain, 
for example, a small, hydrophobic molecule called ubiquinone picks up 
electrons  from  the  NADH  dehydrogenase  complex  and  delivers  them 
to  the  cytochrome  c  reductase  complex  (see  Figure  14–14).  A  related 
quinone functions similarly during electron transport in photosynthesis. 
Ubiquinone can accept or donate either one or two electrons, and it picks 
up one H+ from water with each electron that it carries (figure 14–23). Its 
redox potential of +30 mV places ubiquinone between the NADH dehy-
drogenase complex and the cytochrome c reductase complex in terms of 
its tendency to gain or lose electrons—which explains why ubiquinone 
receives electrons from the former and donates them to the latter (figure 
14–24). Ubiquinone also serves as the entry point for electrons donated 
by the FADH2 that is generated during the citric acid cycle and from fatty 
acid oxidation (see Figures 13–11 and 13–12).  

ECB4 e14.19/14.22

The redox potentials of different metal complexes influence where they 
are  used  along  the  electron-transport  chain.  Iron–sulfur  centers  have 
relatively low affinities for electrons and thus are prominent in the elec-
tron  carriers  that  operate  in  the  early  part  of  the  chain.  An  iron–sulfur 
center in the NADH dehydrogenase complex, for example, passes elec-
trons to ubiquinone. Later in the pathway, iron atoms held in the heme 
groups  bound  to  cytochrome  proteins  are  commonly  used  as  electron 
carriers (figure 14–25). These heme groups give cytochromes, such as

figure 14–23 Quinones carry electrons 
within the lipid bilayer. the quinone in the 
mitochondrial electron-transport chain is 
called ubiquinone. It picks up one h+ from 
the aqueous environment for every electron 
it accepts, and it can carry two electrons as 
part of its hydrogen atoms (red ). When this 
reduced ubiquinone donates its electrons to 
the next carrier in the chain, the protons are 
released. Its long, hydrophobic hydrocarbon 
tail confines ubiquinone to the inner 
mitochondrial membrane. 

QUESTION 14–6

At many steps in the electron-
transport chain, Fe ions are used 
as part of heme or FeS clusters to 
bind the electrons in transit. Why 
do these functional groups that 
carry out the chemistry of electron 
transfer need to be bound to 
proteins? Provide several different 
reasons why this is necessary.

along the mitochondrial electron-

potential occur across each of the three 
respiratory enzyme complexes, as required 
for each of them to pump protons. to

that 1 kilocalorie is equal to about  
4.2 kilojoules.

down  the  mitochondrial  electron-transport  chain  they  are  located.  For 
example, cytochrome c, a small protein that accepts electrons from the 
cytochrome c reductase complex and transfers them to the cytochrome c 
oxidase complex, has a redox potential of +230 mV—a value about mid-
way between those of the cytochromes with which it interacts (see Figure 
14–24). 

MBoC6 m14.22/14.13

Cytochrome c Oxidase Catalyzes the Reduction of 
Molecular Oxygen
Cytochrome c oxidase, the final electron carrier in the respiratory chain, 
has  the  highest  redox  potential  of  all.  This  protein  complex  removes 
electrons  from  cytochrome  c,  thereby  oxidizing  it—hence  the  name 
“cytochrome  c  oxidase.”  These  electrons  are  then  handed  off  to  O2  to 
produce H2O. In total, four electrons donated by cytochrome c and four 
protons from the aqueous environment are added to each O2 molecule in 
the reaction 4e– + 4H+ + O2 → 2H2O. 
In addition to the protons that combine with O2, four other protons are 
pumped across the membrane during the transfer of four electrons from 
cytochrome c to O2. This transfer of electrons drives allosteric changes 
in  the  conformation  of  the  protein  that  move  protons  out  of  the  mito-
chondrial  matrix.  A  special  oxygen-binding  site  within  this  protein 
complex—which contains both a heme group plus a copper atom—serves 
as the final repository for all of the electrons donated by NADH at the start 
of the electron-transport chain (figure 14–26). It is here that nearly all the 
oxygen we breathe is consumed. 

Oxygen is useful as an electron sink because of its very high affinity for 
electrons. However, once O2 picks up one electron, it forms the superox-
–; this radical is dangerously reactive and will avidly take up 
ide radical O2
another three electrons wherever it can find them, a tendency that can 
cause  serious  damage  to  nearby  DNA,  proteins,  and  lipid  membranes. 
The  active  site  of  cytochrome  c  oxidase  holds  on  tightly  to  an  oxygen 
molecule until it receives all four of the electrons needed to convert it to 
two molecules of H2O. This retention helps prevent superoxide radicals 
from  attacking  macromolecules  throughout  the  cell—damage  that  has 
been postulated to contribute to human aging.

QUESTION 14–7

carriers, ubiquinone and cytochrome 
c, shuttle electrons between the

answer.

plex  is  therefore  essential  for  all  aerobic  life.  Poisons  such  as  cyanide 
are  extremely  toxic  because  they  bind  tightly  to  cytochrome  c  oxidase 
complexes, thereby halting electron transport and the production of ATP. 

ECB4 m14.21/14.25

CHLOROPLASTS AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Virtually  all  the  organic  material  in  present-day  cells  is  produced  by  
photosynthesis—the series of light-driven reactions that creates organic 
molecules  from  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2).  Plants,  algae,  and 
photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria use electrons from water 
and  the  energy  of  sunlight  to  convert  atmospheric  CO2  into  organic 
compounds. In the course of these reactions, water molecules are split, 
releasing vast quantities of O2 gas into the atmosphere. This oxygen in 
turn  supports  oxidative  phosphorylation—not  only  in  animals  but  also 
in plants and aerobic bacteria. Thus the activity of early photosynthetic 
bacteria, which filled the atmosphere with oxygen, enabled the evolution 
of the myriad life-forms that use aerobic metabolism to make their ATP 
(figure 14–27).

In  plants,  photosynthesis  is  carried  out  in  a  specialized  intracellular 
organelle—the  chloroplast,  which  contains  light-capturing  pigments 
such  as  the  green  pigment  chlorophyll.  For  most  plants,  the  leaves  are 
the major sites of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs only during the 
daylight hours, producing ATP and NADPH. These activated carriers can 
then  be  used,  at  any  time  of  day,  to  convert  CO2  into  sugar  inside  the 
chloroplast—a process called carbon fixation. 

Given  the  chloroplast’s  central  role  in  photosynthesis,  we  begin  this 
section  by  describing  the  structure  of  this  highly  specialized  organelle. 
We then provide an overview of photosynthesis, followed by a detailed 
accounting of the mechanism by which chloroplasts harvest energy from 
sunlight to produce huge amounts of ATP and NADPH. We next describe 
how plants use these two activated carriers to synthesize the sugars and 
other food molecules that sustain them—and the many organisms that 
eat plants.

Chloroplasts Resemble Mitochondria but Have an Extra 
Compartment—the Thylakoid
Chloroplasts are larger than mitochondria, but both are organized along 
structurally  similar  principles.  Chloroplasts  have  a  highly  permeable 
outer membrane and a much less permeable inner membrane, in which 
various  membrane  transport  proteins  are  embedded.  Together,  these 
two membranes—and the narrow, intermembrane space that separates 
them—form the chloroplast envelope. The inner membrane surrounds a 
large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial 
matrix and contains many metabolic enzymes (see Figure 14–5). 

ECB4 e14.24/14.26

There  is,  however,  one  important  difference  between  the  organization 
of  mitochondria  and  that  of  chloroplasts.  The  inner  membrane  of  the 
chloroplast  does  not  contain  the  photosynthetic  machinery.  Instead, 
the light-capturing systems, electron-transport chain, and ATP synthase 
that  produce  ATP  during  photosynthesis  are  all  contained  in  the  thyla-
koid membrane. This third membrane is folded to form a set of flattened, 
disclike sacs, called the thylakoids, which are arranged in stacks called 
grana (figure 14–28). The space inside each thylakoid is thought to be 
connected  with  that  of  other  thylakoids,  creating  a  third  internal  com-
partment, the thylakoid space, which is separate from the stroma.

QUESTION 14–8

Chloroplasts have a third internal 
compartment, the thylakoid 
space, bounded by the thylakoid 
membrane. This membrane contains 
the photosystems, reaction centers, 
electron-transport chain, and ATP 
synthase. In contrast, mitochondria 
use their inner membrane for 
electron transport and ATP 
synthesis. In both organelles, 
protons are pumped out of the 
largest internal compartment 
(the matrix in mitochondria and 
the stroma in chloroplasts). The 
thylakoid space is completely sealed 
off from the rest of the cell. Why 
does this arrangement allow a larger 
H+ gradient in chloroplasts than can 
be achieved for mitochondria?

Photosynthesis Generates—Then Consumes—ATP and 
NADPH 
The chemistry carried out by photosynthesis can be summarized in one 
simple equation: 

light energy + CO2 + H2O → sugars + O2 + heat energy

On  its  surface,  the  equation  accurately  represents  the  process  by 
which  light  energy  drives  the  production  of  sugars  from  CO2.  But  this 
superficial  accounting  leaves  out  two  of  the  most  important  players  in 
photosynthesis: the activated carriers ATP and NADPH. In the first stage 
of photosynthesis, the energy from sunlight is used to produce ATP and 
NADPH;  in  the  second  stage,  these  activated  carriers  are  consumed  to 
fuel the synthesis of sugars. 

1.  Stage 1 of photosynthesis is, in large part, equivalent to the oxida-
tive phosphorylation that takes place on the mitochondrial inner 
membrane.  In  this  stage,  an  electron-transport  chain  in  the  thy-
lakoid  membrane  harnesses  the  energy  of  electron  transport  to 
pump protons into the thylakoid space; the resulting proton gradi-
ent then drives the synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. What makes 
photosynthesis different is that the high-energy electrons donated 
to  the  photosynthetic  electron-transport  chain  come  from  a  mole-
cule of chlorophyll that has absorbed energy from sunlight. Thus 
the  energy-producing  reactions  of  stage  1  are  sometimes  called 
the  light  reactions  (figure  14–29).  The  other  major  difference 
between  photosynthesis  and  oxidative  phosphorylation  is  where 
the high-energy electrons ultimately wind up: those that make their 
way down the photosynthetic electron-transport chain in chloro-
plasts are donated not to O2, but to NADP+, to produce NADPH. 

2.  In Stage 2 of photosynthesis, the ATP and the NADPH produced by 
the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions of stage 1 are used 
to drive the manufacture of sugars from CO2 (see Figure 14–29). 
These  carbon-fixation  reactions  can  occur  in  the  absence  of  sun-
light  and  are  thus  also  called  the  dark  reactions.  They  begin  in 
the chloroplast stroma, where they generate a three-carbon sugar 
called  glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate.  This  simple  sugar  is  exported 
to  the  cytosol,  where  it  is  used  to  produce  sucrose  and  a  large 
number of other organic molecules in the leaves of the plant. 

Although the formation of ATP and NADPH during stage 1, and the conver-
sion of CO2 to carbohydrate during stage 2, are mediated by two separate 
sets of reactions, they are linked by elaborate feedback mechanisms that

electrons are extracted from 
water and oxygen is released 
as a by-product, as we discuss 
shortly. In stage 2, carbon 
dioxide is assimilated (fixed) to 
produce sugars and a variety 
of other organic molecules. 
Stage 1 occurs in the thylakoid

allow  a  plant  to  manufacture  sugars  only  when  it  is  appropriate  to  do 
so.  Several  of  the  enzymes  required  for  carbon  fixation,  for  example, 
are inactivated in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron 
transport.

Chlorophyll Molecules Absorb the Energy of Sunlight
Visible  light  is  a  form  of  electromagnetic  radiation  composed  of  many 
wavelengths,  ranging  from  violet  (wavelength  400  nm)  to  deep  red  
(700 nm). Most chlorophylls best absorb light in the blue and red wave-
lengths (figure 14–30). Because these pigments absorb green light poorly, 
plants look green to us: the green light is reflected back to our eyes.

Chlorophyll’s ability to harness energy derived from sunlight stems from its 
unique structure. The electrons in a chlorophyll molecule are distributed 
in a decentralized cloud around the molecule’s light-absorbing porphyrin 
ring (figure 14–31). When light of an appropriate wavelength hits a mol-
ecule of chlorophyll, it excites electrons in this diffuse network, perturbing 
the way the electrons are distributed. This perturbed high-energy state is 
unstable, and an excited chlorophyll molecule will seek to get rid of this 
excess energy so it can return to its more stable, unexcited state. 

A molecule of chlorophyll, on its own in solution, would simply release 
its absorbed energy in the form of light or heat—accomplishing nothing 
useful. However, chlorophyll molecules in a chloroplast are able to con-
vert light energy into a form of energy useful to the cell because they are 
associated with a special set of photosynthetic proteins in the thylakoid 
membrane, as we see next.

Excited Chlorophyll Molecules Funnel Energy into a 
Reaction Center
In the thylakoid membrane of plants and the plasma membrane of pho-
tosynthetic bacteria, chlorophyll molecules are held in large multiprotein 
complexes  called  photosystems.  Each  photosystem  consists  of  a  set 
of antenna complexes, which capture light energy, and a reaction center, 
which converts that light energy into chemical energy. 

In  each  antenna  complex,  hundreds  of  chlorophyll  molecules  are 
arranged so that the light energy captured by one chlorophyll molecule 
can be transferred to a neighboring chlorophyll molecule in the network. 
In  this  way,  energy  jumps  randomly  from  one  chlorophyll  molecule  to 
the next—either within the same antenna or in an adjacent antenna. At 
some  point,  this  wandering  energy  will  encounter  a  chlorophyll  dimer 
called the special pair, which holds its electrons at a lower energy than 
do the other chlorophyll molecules. Thus when energy is accepted by this 
special pair, it becomes effectively trapped there. 

The  chlorophyll  special  pair  is  not  located  in  an  antenna  complex. 
Instead, it is part of the reaction center—a transmembrane complex of 
proteins  and  pigments  that  is  thought  to  have  first  evolved  more  than  
3  billion  years  ago  in  primitive  photosynthetic  bacteria  (Movie  14.6). 
Within the reaction center, the special pair is positioned directly next to 
a set of electron carriers that are poised to accept a high-energy electron 

figure 14–31 Chlorophyll’s structure allows it to absorb energy 
from light. each chlorophyll molecule contains a porphyrin ring with a 
magnesium atom (pink) at its center. this porphyrin ring is structurally 
similar to the one that binds iron in heme (see Figure 14–25). Light is 
absorbed by electrons within the bond network shown in blue, while 
the long, hydrophobic tail (gray) helps hold the chlorophyll in the 
thylakoid membrane.

from  the  excited  chlorophyll  special  pair  (figure  14–32).  This  electron 
transfer lies at the heart of photosynthesis, because it converts the light 
energy that came into the special pair into chemical energy in the form 
of a transferable electron. As soon as the high-energy electron is handed 
off, the chlorophyll special pair becomes positively charged, and the elec-
tron carrier that accepts the electron becomes negatively charged. The 
rapid  movement  of  this  electron  along  a  set  of  electron  carriers  in  the 
reaction center then creates a charge separation that sets in motion the 
flow of electrons from the reaction center to an electron-transport chain 
(figure 14–33). 

ECB4 m14.323a/14.34

A Pair of Photosystems Cooperate to Generate Both ATP 
and NADPH
Photosynthesis is ultimately a biosynthetic process, and to build organic 
molecules from CO2, a plant cell requires a huge input of energy, in the 
form of ATP, and a very large amount of reducing power, in the form of 
the activated carrier NADPH (see Figure 3–34). To generate both ATP and 
NADPH,  plant  cells—and  free-living  photosynthetic  organisms  such  as 
cyanobacteria—use a pair of photosystems that are similar in structure, 
but that do different things with the high-energy electrons that leave their 
reaction center chlorophylls. 

When the first photosystem (which, paradoxically, is called photosystem 
II for historical reasons) absorbs light energy, its reaction center passes 
electrons to a mobile electron carrier called plastoquinone, which is part 
of the photosynthetic electron-transport chain. This carrier transfers the 
high-energy electrons to a proton pump, which—like the proton pumps in 
the mitochondrial inner membrane—uses the movement of electrons to 
generate an electrochemical proton gradient. The electrochemical proton 
gradient then drives the production of ATP by an ATP synthase located in 
the thylakoid membrane (figure 14–34).

At  the  same  time,  a  second  nearby  photosystem—called  photosystem 
I—has been also busy capturing the energy from sunlight. The reaction 
center of this photosystem passes its high-energy electrons to a different 
mobile electron carrier, which brings them to an enzyme that uses them 
to reduce NADP+ to NADPH (figure 14–35). The combined action of these 

chloroplasts and photosynthesis

figure 14–32 a photosystem consists 
of a reaction center surrounded 
by chlorophyll-containing antenna 
complexes. Once light energy has been 
captured by a chlorophyll molecule in an 
antenna complex, it will pass randomly from 
one chlorophyll molecule to another (red 
lines), until it gets trapped by a chlorophyll 
dimer called the special pair, located in 
the reaction center. the chlorophyll special 
pair holds its electrons at a lower energy 
than the antenna chlorophylls, so the 
energy transferred to it from the antenna 
gets trapped there. Note that in the 
antenna complex only energy moves from 
one chlorophyll molecule to another, not 
electrons. 

figure 14–33 In a reaction center, a high-
energy electron is transferred from the 
special pair to a carrier that becomes part 
of an electron-transport chain. Not shown 
is a set of intermediary carriers embedded 
in the reaction center that provide the path 
from the special pair to this carrier (orange). 
as illustrated, the transfer of the high-
energy electron from the excited chlorophyll 
special pair leaves behind a positive charge 
that creates a charge-separated state, 
thereby converting light energy to chemical 
energy. Once the electron in the special pair 
has been replaced (an event we will discuss 
in detail shortly), the carrier diffuses away 
from the reaction center, transferring the 
high-energy electron to the transport chain.

QUESTION 14–9

Both NADPH and the related carrier 
molecule NADH are strong electron 
donors. Why might plant cells have 
evolved to rely on NADPH, rather 
than NADH, to provide the reducing 
power for photosynthesis?

two photosystems thus produces both the ATP (photosystem II) and the 
NADPH (photosystem I) that will be used in stage 2 of photosynthesis (see 
Figure 14–29).

Oxygen Is Generated by a Water-Splitting Complex 
Associated with Photosystem II
The  scheme  that  we  have  thus  far  described  for  photosynthesis  has 
ignored  a  major  chemical  conundrum.  When  a  mobile  electron  carrier 
removes an electron from a reaction center (whether in photosystem I or 
photosystem II), it leaves behind a positively charged chlorophyll special 
pair (see Figure 14–33). To reset the system and allow photosynthesis to 
proceed, this missing electron must be replaced. 

ECB4 m14.38left/14.32

For  photosystem  II,  the  missing  electron  is  replaced  by  a  special  pro-
tein complex that removes the electrons from water. This water-splitting 
enzyme contains a cluster of manganese atoms that holds onto two water 
molecules from which electrons are extracted one at a time. Once four 
electrons have been removed from these two water molecules—and used 
to replace the electrons lost by four excited chlorophyll special pairs—O2 
is released (figure 14–36). 

This “waiting for four electrons” maneuver ensures that no partly oxidized 
water  molecules  are  released  as  dangerous  highly  reactive  chemicals. 
The same trick is used by the cytochrome c oxidase that catalyzes the 
reverse reaction—the transfer of electrons to O2 to produce water—dur-
ing oxidative phosphorylation (see Figure 14–26).

It is astounding to realize that essentially all of the oxygen in the Earth’s 
atmosphere has been produced by the water-splitting enzyme of photo-
system II. 

figure 14–35 photosystem I transfers 
high-energy electrons to an enzyme that 
produces NaDph. When light energy 
is captured by photosystem I, a high-
energy electron is passed to a mobile 
electron carrier called ferredoxin (Fd), a 
small protein that contains an iron–sulfur 
center. Ferredoxin carries its electrons to 
ferredoxin-NaDp reductase (FNr), the final 
protein in the electron-transport chain that 
generates NaDph.

The Special Pair in Photosystem I Receives its Electrons 
from Photosystem II
We  have  seen  that  photosystem  II  receives  electrons  from  water.  But 
where does photosystem I get the electrons it needs to reset its special 
pair?  It  gets  them  from  photosystem  II:  the  chlorophyll  special  pair  in 
photosystem I serves as the final electron acceptor for the electron-trans-
port chain that carries electrons from photosystem II. The overall flow of 
electrons  is  shown  in  figure  14–37.  Electrons  removed  from  water  by 
photosystem II are passed, through a proton pump  (the cytochrome b6-f 
complex), to a mobile electron carrier called plastocyanin. Plastocyanin 
then  carries  these  electrons  to  photosystem  I,  to  replace  the  electrons 
lost by its excited chlorophyll special pair. When light is again absorbed 
by this photosystem, this electron will be boosted to the very high-energy 
level needed to reduce NADP+ to NADPH.
Having these two photosystems operating in tandem effectively couples 
their two electron-energizing steps. This extra boost of energy—provided 
by the light harvested by both photosystems—allows an electron to be 
moved from water, which normally holds onto its electrons very tightly 
(redox potential = +820 mV), to NADPH, which normally holds onto its 
electrons  loosely  (redox  potential  =  –320  mV).  There  is  even  enough 
energy left over to enable the electron-transport chain that links the two 
photosystems to pump H+ across the thylakoid membrane, so that ATP

protons by the cytochrome b6-f complex.

are then donated to a copper-containing 
protein, the mobile electron carrier 
plastocyanin (pc), which ferries them to the

electrons are used to generate NaDph.

Carbon Fixation Uses ATP and NADPH to Convert  
CO2 into Sugars
The  light  reactions  of  photosynthesis  generate  ATP  and  NADPH  in  the 
chloroplast stroma, as we have just seen. But the inner membrane of the 
chloroplast is impermeable to both of these compounds, which means 
that they cannot be exported directly to the cytosol. To provide energy 
and  reducing  power  for  the  rest  of  the  cell,  the  ATP  and  NADPH  are 
instead used within the chloroplast stroma to produce sugars, which can 
be  exported  by  specific  carrier  proteins  in  the  chloroplast  inner  mem-
brane. This production of sugar from CO2 and water, which occurs during 
the dark reactions (stage 2) of photosynthesis, is called carbon fixation. 
In  the  central  reaction  of  photosynthetic  carbon  fixation,  CO2  from 
the  atmosphere  is  attached  to  a  five-carbon  sugar  derivative,  ribulose 
1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of the three-carbon compound 
3-phosphoglycerate. This carbon-fixing reaction, which was discovered in 
1948, is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribu-
lose bisphosphate carboxylase or Rubisco (figure 14–39). Rubisco works 
much  more  slowly  than  most  other  enzymes:  it  processes  about  three 
molecules of substrate per second—compared with 1000 molecules per 
second for a typical enzyme. To compensate for this sluggish behavior, 
plants maintain a surplus of Rubisco to ensure the efficient production of 
sugars. The enzyme often represents more than 50% of the total chloro-
plast protein, and it is widely claimed to be the most abundant protein 
on Earth.
Although  the  production  of  carbohydrates  from  CO2  and  H2O  is  ener-
getically  unfavorable,  the  fixation  of  CO2  catalyzed  by  Rubisco  is  an

energetically favorable reaction. Carbon fixation is energetically favorable 
because a continuous supply of the energy-rich ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 
is fed into it. As this compound is consumed—by the addition of CO2 (see 
Figure 14–39)—it must be replenished. The energy and reducing power 
needed to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate come from the ATP and 
NADPH produced by the photosynthetic light reactions. 
The  elaborate  series  of  reactions  in  which  CO2  combines  with  ribu-
lose 1,5-bisphosphate to produce a simple sugar—a portion of which is 
used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate—forms a cycle, called the 
carbon-fixation cycle, or the Calvin cycle (figure 14–40). For every three

the formation of a covalent bond that

QUESTION 14–10

A.  How do cells in plant roots 
survive, since they contain no 
chloroplasts and are not exposed to 
light? 
B.  Unlike mitochondria, 
chloroplasts do not have a 
transporter that allows them to 
export ATP to the cytosol. How, 
then, do plant cells obtain the ATP 
that they need to carry out energy-
requiring metabolic reactions in the 
cytosol?

figure 14–40 The carbon-fixation cycle 
consumes aTp and NaDph to form 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from CO2 
and h2O. In the first stage of the cycle, 
cO2 is added to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 
(as shown in Figure 14–39). In the second 
stage, atp and NaDph are consumed to 
produce glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In 
the final stage, some of the glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate produced is used to 
regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; the 
rest is transported out of the chloroplast 
stroma into the cytosol. the number of 
carbon atoms in each type of molecule 
is indicated in yellow. there are many 
intermediates between glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate, 
but they have been omitted here for clarity. 
the entry of water into the cycle is also not 
shown.

molecules  of  CO2  that  enter  the  cycle,  one  molecule  of  glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate is produced, and nine molecules of ATP and six molecules 
of NADPH are consumed. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the three-carbon 
sugar that is the final product of the cycle, then provides the starting mate-
rial for the synthesis of many other sugars and other organic molecules.

Sugars Generated by Carbon Fixation Can Be Stored As 
Starch or Consumed to Produce ATP
The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate generated by carbon fixation in the chlo-
roplast stroma can be used in a number of ways, depending on the needs 
of the plant. During periods of excess photosynthetic activity, much of it 
is retained in the chloroplast stroma and converted to starch. Like glyco-
gen in animal cells, starch is a large polymer of glucose that serves as a 
carbohydrate reserve, and it is stored as large granules in the chloroplast 
stroma. Starch forms an important part of the diet of all animals that eat 
plants. Other glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules are converted to fat 
in the stroma. This material, which accumulates as fat droplets, likewise 
serves as an energy reserve (figure 14–41). 

At night, this stored starch and fat can be broken down to sugars and 
fatty acids, which are exported to the cytosol to help support the meta-
bolic needs of the plant. Some of the exported sugar enters the glycolytic 
pathway (see Figure 13–5), where it is converted to pyruvate. That pyru-
vate, along with the fatty acids, can enter the plant cell mitochondria and 
be fed into the citric acid cycle, ultimately leading to the production of 
ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (figure 14–42). Plants use this ATP in 
the same way that animal cells and other nonphotosynthetic organisms 
do to power a variety of metabolic reactions.

the chloroplast’s inner membrane is 
impermeable to the atp and NaDph that 
are produced in the stroma during the 
light reactions of photosynthesis. these 
molecules are therefore funneled into the 
carbon-fixation cycle, where they are used 
to make sugars. the resulting sugars and 
their metabolites are either stored within 
the chloroplast—in the form of starch or 
fat—or exported to the rest of the plant cell. 
there, they can enter the energy-generating 
pathway that ends in atp synthesis in the 
mitochondria. Mitochondrial membranes 
are permeable to atp, as indicated. Note 
that the O2 released to the atmosphere by 
photosynthesis in chloroplasts is used for 
oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria; 
similarly, the cO2 released by the citric acid 
cycle in mitochondria is used for carbon 
fixation in chloroplasts.

The  glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate  exported  from  chloroplasts  into  the 
cytosol can also be converted into many other metabolites, including the 
disaccharide sucrose. Sucrose is the major form in which sugar is trans-
ported between the cells of a plant: just as glucose is transported in the 
blood of animals, so sucrose is exported from the leaves via the vascular 
bundle to provide carbohydrate to the rest of the plant.

THE EVOLUTION OF ENERGY-GENERATING 
SYSTEMS 
The ability to sequence the genomes of microorganisms that are difficult, 
if  not  impossible,  to  grow  in  culture  has  made  it  possible  to  identify  a 
huge variety of previously mysterious life-forms. Some of these unicel-
lular  organisms  thrive  in  the  most  inhospitable  habitats  on  the  planet, 
including sulfurous hot springs and hydrothermal vents that lie deep on 
the  ocean  floor.  In  these  remarkable  microbes,  we  are  finding  clues  to 
life’s history. Like fingerprints left at the scene of a crime, the proteins and 
small molecules these organisms produce provide evidence that allows 
us to trace the history of ancient biological events, including those that 
gave rise to the ATP-generating systems present in the mitochondria and 
chloroplasts  of  modern  eukaryotic  cells.  We  therefore  end  this  chapter 
with a brief review of what has been learned about the origins of present-
day energy-harvesting systems, which have played such a critical part in 
fueling the evolution of life on Earth.

Oxidative Phosphorylation Evolved in Stages
As we mentioned earlier, the first living cells on Earth—both prokaryotes 
and primitive eukaryotes—may have consumed geochemically produced 
organic molecules and generated ATP by fermentation. Because oxygen 
was  not  yet  present  in  the  atmosphere,  such  anaerobic  fermentation 
reactions  would  have  dumped  organic  acids—such  as  lactic  or  formic 
acids, for example—into the environment (see Figure 13–6A).

Perhaps such acids lowered the pH of the environment, favoring the sur-
vival of cells that evolved transmembrane proteins that could pump H+ 
out of the cytosol, thereby preventing the cell from becoming too acidic 
(stage 1 in figure 14–43). One of these pumps may have used the energy 
available  from  ATP  hydrolysis  to  eject  H+  from  the  cell;  such  a  proton 
pump could have been the ancestor of present-day ATP synthases. 

As the Earth’s supply of geochemically produced nutrients began to dwin-
dle, organisms that could find a way to pump H+ without consuming ATP 
would have been at an advantage: they could save the small amounts of 
ATP they derived from the fermentation of increasingly scarce foodstuffs 
to fuel other important activities. This need to conserve resources might 
have led to the evolution of electron-transport proteins that allowed cells 
to use the movement of electrons between molecules of different redox 
potentials as a source of energy for pumping H+ across the plasma mem-
brane  (stage  2  in  Figure  14–43).  Some  of  these  cells  might  have  used 
the nonfermentable organic acids that neighboring cells had excreted as 
waste to provide the electrons needed to feed this electron-transport sys-
tem. Some present-day bacteria grow on formic acid, for example, using 
the small amount of redox energy derived from the transfer of electrons 
from formic acid to fumarate to pump H+. 
Eventually, some bacteria would have developed H+-pumping electron-
transport  systems  that  were  so  efficient  that  they  could  harvest  more 
redox energy than they needed to maintain their internal pH. Such cells 
would probably have generated large electrochemical proton gradients,

figure 14–43 Oxidative phosphorylation 
might have evolved in stages. the first 
stage could have involved the evolution 
of an atpase that pumped protons out of 
the cell using the energy of atp hydrolysis. 
Stage 2 could have involved the evolution 
of a different proton pump, driven by an 
electron-transport chain. Stage 3 would then 
have linked these two systems together 
to generate an atp synthase that uses the 
protons pumped by the electron-transport 
chain to synthesize atp. a bacterium with 
this final system would have had a selective 
advantage over bacteria with neither of the 
systems or only one.

480 

ChapTER 14     energy Generation in Mitochondria and chloroplasts

which they could then use to produce ATP. Protons could leak back into 
the cell through the ATP-driven H+ pumps, essentially running them in 
reverse so that they synthesized ATP (stage 3 in Figure 14–43). Because 
such cells would require much less of the dwindling supply of fermentable 
nutrients, they would have proliferated at the expense of their neighbors. 

Photosynthetic Bacteria Made Even Fewer Demands on 
Their Environment
The  major  evolutionary  breakthrough  in  energy  metabolism,  however, 
was  almost  certainly  the  formation  of  photochemical  reaction  cent-
ers that could use the energy of sunlight to produce molecules such as 
NADH. It is thought that this development occurred early in the process of 
evolution—more than 3 billion years ago, in the ancestors of green sulfur 
bacteria.  Present-day  green  sulfur  bacteria  use  light  energy  to  trans-
fer hydrogen atoms (as an electron plus a proton) from H2S to NADPH, 
thereby creating the strong reducing power required for carbon fixation 
(figure 14–44). 

The  next  step  is  thought  to  have  involved  the  evolution  of  organisms 
capable of using water instead of H2S as the electron source for photo-
synthesis. This entailed the evolution of a water-splitting enzyme and the 
addition of a second photosystem, acting in conjunction with the first, to 
bridge  the  enormous  gap  in  redox  potential  between  H2O  and  NADPH 
(see Figure 14–38). The biological consequences of this evolutionary step 
were far-reaching. For the first time, there were organisms that made only 
minimal chemical demands on their environment. These cells—including 
the  first  cyanobacteria  (see  Figure  14–27)—could  spread  and  evolve  in 
ways  denied  to  the  earlier  photosynthetic  bacteria,  which  needed  H2S, 
organic acids, or other sources as a source of electrons. Consequently, 
large amounts of fermentable organic materials—produced by these cells 
and  their  ancestors—began  to  accumulate.  Moreover,  O2  entered  the 
atmosphere in large amounts (figure 14–45).
The  availability  of  O2  made  possible  the  development  of  bacteria  that 
relied on aerobic metabolism to make their ATP. As explained previously, 
these organisms could harness the large amount of energy released when 
they break down carbohydrates and other reduced organic molecules all 
the way to CO2 and H2O. 
As  organic  materials  accumulated  as  a  by-product  of  photosynthesis, 
some photosynthetic bacteria—including the ancestors of the bacterium 

figure 14–44 photosynthesis in green 
sulfur bacteria uses hydrogen sulfide 
(h2S) as an electron donor rather than 
water. electrons are easier to extract from 
h2S than from h2O, because h2S has a 
much higher redox potential (compare 
with Figure 14–38). therefore, only one 
photosystem is needed to produce 
NaDph, and elemental sulfur is formed 
as a by-product instead of O2.the 
photosystem in green sulfur bacteria 
resembles photosystem I in plants and 
cyanobacteria, in that they all use a series of 
iron–sulfur centers as the electron carriers 
that eventually donate their high-energy 
electrons to ferredoxin (Fd). a bacterium of 
this type is Chlorobium tepidum, which can 
thrive at high temperatures and low light 
intensities in hot springs.

figure 14–45 Oxygen entered Earth’s 
atmosphere billions of years ago. 
With the evolution of photosynthesis in 
prokaryotes more than 3 billion years ago, 
organisms would have no longer depended 
on preformed organic chemicals. they 
could have then made their own organic 
molecules from cO2. the delay of more 
than a billion years between the appearance 
of bacteria that split water and released O2 
during photosynthesis and the accumulation 
of high levels of O2 in the atmosphere is 
thought to have been due to the initial 
reaction of the O2 with abundant ferrous 
iron (Fe2+) dissolved in the early oceans. 
Only when the iron was used up would large 
amounts of O2 have started to accumulate 
in the atmosphere. In response to the 
rising amount of O2 in the atmosphere, 
nonphotosynthetic, aerobic organisms 
appeared, and the concentration of O2 in 
the atmosphere eventually leveled out. 

E.  coli—lost  their  ability  to  survive  on  light  energy  alone  and  came  to 
rely entirely on cell respiration. Mitochondria probably arose when a pre-
eukaryotic  cell  engulfed  such  an  aerobic  bacterium  (see  Figure  1–18). 
Plants  arose  somewhat  later,  when  a  descendant  of  this  early  aerobic 
eukaryote captured a photosynthetic bacterium, which became the pre-
cursor of chloroplasts (see Figure 1–20). Once eukaryotes had acquired 
the bacterial symbionts that became mitochondria and chloroplasts, they 
could then embark on the spectacular pathway of evolution that eventu-
ally led to complex multicellular organisms.

The Lifestyle of Methanococcus Suggests That 
Chemiosmotic Coupling Is an Ancient Process
The  conditions  today  that  most  resemble  those  under  which  cells  are 
thought to have lived 3.5–3.8 billion years ago may be those near deep-
ocean  hydrothermal  vents.  These  vents  represent  places  where  the 
Earth’s molten mantle is breaking through the overlying crust, expanding 
the width of the ocean floor. Indeed, the modern organisms that appear 
to  be  most  closely  related  to  the  hypothetical  cells  from  which  all  life 
evolved  live  at  75°C  to  95°C,  temperatures  approaching  that  of  boiling 
water. This ability to thrive at such extreme temperatures suggests that 
life’s common ancestor—the cell that gave rise to bacteria, archaea, and 
eukaryotes—lived under very hot, anaerobic conditions. 

One of the archaea that live in this environment today is Methanococcus 
jannaschii.  Originally  isolated  from  a  hydrothermal  vent  more  than  a 
mile  beneath  the  ocean  surface,  the  organism  grows  in  the  complete 
absence  of  light  and  gaseous  oxygen,  using  as  nutrients  the  inorganic 
gases—hydrogen (H2), CO2, and nitrogen (N2)—that bubble up from the 
vent (figure 14–46). Its mode of existence gives us a hint of how early 
cells might have used electron transport to derive energy and to extract 
carbon molecules from inorganic materials that were freely available on 
the hot early Earth.
Methanococcus  relies  on  N2  gas  as  its  source  of  nitrogen  for  making 
organic  molecules  such  as  amino  acids.  The  organism  reduces  N2  to 
ammonia (NH3) by the addition of hydrogen, a process called nitrogen 
fixation. Nitrogen fixation requires a large amount of energy, as does the 
carbon-fixation  process  that  converts  CO2  and  H2O  into  sugars.  Much 
of the energy that Methanococcus requires for both processes is derived 
from the transfer of electrons from H2 to CO2, with the release of large 
amounts of methane (CH4) as a waste product (thus producing natural gas

Earth’s history. (a) this deep-sea archaean

one shown, where temperatures reach 
near that of boiling water. (B) Scanning

and giving the organism its name). Part of this electron transfer occurs in 
the plasma membrane and results in the pumping of protons (H+) across 
it. The resulting electrochemical proton gradient drives an ATP synthase 
in the same membrane to make ATP. 

ECB4 n14.106/14.47

The  fact  that  such  chemiosmotic  coupling  exists  in  an  organism  like 
Methanococcus suggests that the storage of energy in a proton gradient 
derived  from  electron  transport  is  an  extremely  ancient  process.  Thus, 
chemiosmotic coupling may have fueled the evolution of nearly all life-
forms on Earth.

ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS
•	 Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many prokaryotes generate energy 
by a membrane-based mechanism known as chemiosmotic coupling, 
which involves using an electrochemical proton gradient to drive the 
synthesis of ATP.

•	 Mitochondria	 produce	 most	 of	 an	 animal	 cell’s	 ATP,	 using	 energy	

derived from oxidation of sugars and fatty acids.

•	 Mitochondria	have	an	inner	and	an	outer	membrane.	The	inner	mem-
brane encloses the mitochondrial matrix, where the citric acid cycle 
produces large amounts of NADH and FADH2 from the oxidation of 
acetyl CoA.
In	the	inner	mitochondrial	membrane,	high-energy	electrons	donated	
by  NADH  and  FADH2  pass  along  an  electron-transport  chain  and 
eventually combine with molecular oxygen (O2) to form water.

•	

•	 Much	of	the	energy	released	by	electron	transfers	along	the	electron-
transport chain is harnessed to pump protons (H+) out of the matrix, 
creating an electrochemical proton gradient. The proton pumping is 
carried out by three large respiratory enzyme complexes embedded 
in the inner membrane.

•	 The	electrochemical	proton	gradient	across	the	inner	mitochondrial	
membrane is harnessed to make ATP when protons move back into 
the matrix through an ATP synthase located in the inner membrane.

•	 The	electrochemical	proton	gradient	also	drives	the	active	transport	

•	

of selected metabolites into and out of the mitochondrial matrix.
In	 photosynthesis	 in	 chloroplasts	 and	 photosynthetic	 bacteria,	 the	
energy  of  sunlight  is  captured  by  chlorophyll  molecules  embedded 
in large protein complexes known as photosystems; in plants, these 
photosystems  are  located  in  the  thylakoid  membranes  of  chloro-
plasts in leaf cells.

•	 Electron-transport	 chains	 associated	 with	 photosystems	 transfer	
high-energy electrons from water to NADP+ to form NADPH, which 
produces O2 as a by-product.

•	 The	 photosynthetic	 electron-transport	 chains	 in	 chloroplasts	 also	
generate  a  proton  gradient  across  the  thylakoid  membrane,  which 
is used by an ATP synthase embedded in the membrane to generate

QUESTION 14–11
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your 
answers. 
A.  After an electron has been removed by light, the affinity 
for electrons of the positively charged chlorophyll in the 
reaction center of the first photosystem (photosystem II) is 
even greater than the electron affinity of O2.
B.  Photosynthesis is the light-driven transfer of an electron 
from chlorophyll to a second molecule that normally has a 
much lower affinity for electrons.
C.  Because it requires the removal of four electrons to 
release one O2 molecule from two H2O molecules, the 
water-splitting enzyme in photosystem II has to keep the 
reaction intermediates tightly bound so as to prevent partly 
reduced, and therefore hazardous, superoxide radicals from 
escaping.

QUESTION 14–12
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your 
answers.
A.  Many, but not all, electron-transfer reactions involve 
metal ions.

B.  The electron-transport chain generates an electrical 
potential across the membrane because it moves electrons 
from the intermembrane space into the matrix.

C.  The electrochemical proton gradient consists of two 
components: a pH difference and an electrical potential.
D.  Ubiquinone and cytochrome c are both diffusible 
electron carriers.
E.  Plants have chloroplasts and therefore can live without 
mitochondria. 

484

F.  Both chlorophyll and heme contain an extensive system 
of double bonds that allows them to absorb visible light.
G.  The role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis is equivalent to 
that of heme in mitochondrial electron transport.
H.  Most of the dry weight of a tree comes from the 
minerals that are taken up by the roots.

QUESTION 14–13
A single proton moving down its electrochemical gradient 
into the mitochondrial matrix space liberates 4.6 kcal/
mole of free energy (∆G). How many protons have to flow 
across the inner mitochondrial membrane to synthesize 
one molecule of ATP if the ∆G for ATP synthesis under 
intracellular conditions is between 11 and 13 kcal/mole? (∆G 
is discussed in Chapter 3, pp. 90–100.) Why is a range given 
for this latter value, and not a precise number? Under which 
conditions would the lower value apply?

QUESTION 14–14
In the following statement, choose the correct one of the 
alternatives in italics and justify your answer. “If no O2 is 
available, all components of the mitochondrial electron-
transport chain will accumulate in their reduced/oxidized 
form. If O2 is suddenly added again, the electron carriers 
in cytochrome c oxidase will become reduced/oxidized 
before/after those in NADH dehydrogenase.”

QUESTION 14–15
Assume that the conversion of oxidized ubiquinone to 
reduced ubiquinone by NADH dehydrogenase occurs on 
the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and 
that its oxidation by cytochrome c reductase occurs on the 
intermembrane space side of the membrane (see Figures 
14–14 and 14–23). What are the consequences of this 
arrangement for the generation of the H+ gradient across 
the membrane? 

QUESTION 14–16
If a voltage is applied to two platinum wires (electrodes) 
immersed in water, then water molecules become split into 
H2 and O2 gas. At the negative electrode, electrons are 
donated and H2 gas is released; at the positive electrode, 
electrons are accepted and O2 gas is produced. When 
photosynthetic bacteria and plant cells split water, they 
produce O2, but no H2. Why?

QUESTION 14–17
In an insightful experiment performed in the 1960s, 
chloroplasts were first soaked in an acidic solution at pH 4, 
so that the stroma and thylakoid space became acidified 
(figure Q14–17). They were then transferred to a basic 
solution (pH 8). This quickly increased the pH of the stroma 
to 8, while the thylakoid space temporarily remained at 
pH 4. A burst of ATP synthesis was observed, and the pH 
difference between the thylakoid and the stroma then 
disappeared. 
A.  Explain why these conditions lead to ATP synthesis. 
B.  Is light needed for the experiment to work? 
C.  What would happen if the solutions were switched so 
that the first incubation is in the pH 8 solution and the 
second one in the pH 4 solution?

carbohydrate, which is the opposite direction of electron 
transfer in the mitochondrion?

QUESTION 14–22
A manuscript has been submitted for publication to a 
prestigious scientific journal. In the paper, the authors 
describe an experiment in which they have succeeded in 
trapping an individual ATP synthase molecule and then 
mechanically rotating its head by applying a force to it. 
The authors show that upon rotating the head of the 
ATP synthase, ATP is produced, in the absence of an H+ 
gradient. What might this mean about the mechanism 
whereby ATP synthase functions? Should this manuscript be 
considered for publication in one of the best journals?

FADH2 is produced in the citric acid cycle by a 
membrane-embedded enzyme complex, called succinate 
dehydrogenase, that contains bound FAD and carries out 
the reactions 

and 

succinate + FAD → fumarate + FADH2

FADH2 → FAD + 2H+ + 2e–

The redox potential of FADH2, however, is only –220 mV.

plausible mechanism by which its electrons could be fed into 
the electron-transport chain. Draw a diagram to illustrate 
your proposed mechanism.

QUESTION 14–20
Some bacteria have become specialized to live in an

Intracellular Compartments  
and Protein Transport

At any one time, a typical eukaryotic cell carries out thousands of differ-
ent chemical reactions, many of which are mutually incompatible. One 
series of reactions makes glucose, for example, while another breaks it 
down; some enzymes synthesize peptide bonds, whereas others hydro-
lyze them, and so on. Indeed, if the cells of an organ such as the liver are 
broken  apart  and  their  contents  mixed  together  in  a  test  tube,  chemi-
cal chaos results, and the cells’ enzymes and other proteins are quickly 
degraded by their own proteolytic enzymes. For a cell to operate effec-
tively,  the  different  intracellular  processes  that  occur  simultaneously 
must somehow be segregated.

Cells  have  evolved  several  strategies  for  isolating  and  organizing  their 
chemical reactions. One strategy used by both prokaryotic and eukary-
otic  cells  is  to  aggregate  the  different  enzymes  required  to  catalyze  a 
particular sequence of reactions into large, multicomponent complexes. 
Such complexes are used, for example, in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and 
proteins. A second strategy, which is most highly developed in eukary-
otic cells, is to confine different metabolic processes—and the proteins 
required  to  perform  them—within  different  membrane-enclosed  com-
partments. As discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, cell membranes provide 
selectively permeable barriers through which the transport of most mol-
ecules  can  be  controlled.  In  this  chapter,  we  consider  this  strategy  of 
membrane-dependent compartmentalization.

In the first section, we describe the principal membrane-enclosed com-
partments,  or  membrane-enclosed  organelles,  of  eukaryotic  cells  and 
briefly consider their main functions. In the second section, we discuss 
how the protein composition of the different compartments is set up and

maintained.  Each  compartment  contains  a  unique  set  of  proteins  that 
have to be transferred selectively from the cytosol, where they are made, 
to  the  compartment  where  they  are  used.  This  transfer  process,  called 
protein sorting, depends on signals built into the amino acid sequence of 
the proteins. In the third section, we describe how certain membrane-
enclosed  compartments  in  a  eukaryotic  cell  communicate  with  one 
another  by  forming  small,  membrane-enclosed  sacs,  or  vesicles.  These 
vesicles pinch off from one compartment, move through the cytosol, and 
fuse with another compartment in a process called vesicular transport. In 
the last two sections, we discuss how this constant vesicular traffic also 
provides the main routes for releasing proteins from the cell by the proc-
ess of exocytosis and for importing them by the process of endocytosis.

membrane-enclosed organelles
Whereas  a  prokaryotic  cell  usually  consists  of  a  single  compartment 
enclosed by the plasma membrane, eukaryotic cells are elaborately sub-
divided by internal membranes. When a cross section through a plant or 
an animal cell is examined in the electron microscope, numerous small, 
membrane-enclosed sacs, tubes, spheres, and irregularly shaped struc-
tures can be seen, often arranged without much apparent order (Figure 
15–1). These structures are all distinct, membrane-enclosed organelles, 
or  parts  of  such  organelles,  each  of  which  contains  a  unique  set  of 
large and small molecules and carries out a specialized function. In this 
section, we review these functions and discuss how different membrane-
enclosed organelles may have evolved.

eukaryotic cells contain a basic set of membrane-
enclosed organelles
The major membrane-enclosed organelles of an animal cell are illus-
trated in Figure 15–2, and their functions are summarized in Table 15–1. 
These  organelles  are  surrounded  by  the  cytosol,  which  is  enclosed  by 
the  plasma  membrane.  The  nucleus  is  generally  the  most  prominent 
organelle  in  eukaryotic  cells.  It  is  surrounded  by  a  double  membrane, 
known as the nuclear envelope, and communicates with the cytosol via 
nuclear pores that perforate the envelope. The outer nuclear membrane

is  continuous  with  the  membrane  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER),  a 
system of interconnected sacs and tubes of membrane that often extends 
throughout most of the cell. The ER is the major site of synthesis of new 
membranes in the cell. Large areas of the ER have ribosomes attached 
to the cytosolic surface and are designated rough endoplasmic reticulum 
(rough  ER).  The  ribosomes  are  actively  synthesizing  proteins  that  are 
delivered into the ER membrane or into the ER interior, a space called 
the  lumen.  The  smooth  endoplasmic  reticulum  (smooth  ER)  lacks  ribos-
omes.  It  is  scanty  in  most  cells  but  is  highly  developed  for  performing 
particular functions in others: for example, it is the site of steroid hor-
mone synthesis in some endocrine cells of the adrenal gland and the site 
where  a  variety  of  organic  molecules,  including  alcohol,  are  detoxified 
in  liver  cells.  In  many  eukaryotic  cells,  the  smooth  ER  also  sequesters 
Ca2+ from the cytosol; the release and reuptake of Ca2+ from the ER is 
involved in the rapid response to many extracellular signals, as discussed 
in Chapters 12 and 16.

ChaPTEr 15     Intracellular compartments and protein transport

The Golgi apparatus, which is usually situated near the nucleus, receives 
proteins and lipids from the ER, modifies them, and then dispatches them 
to other destinations in the cell. Small sacs of digestive enzymes called 
lysosomes degrade worn-out organelles, as well as macromolecules and 
particles taken into the cell by endocytosis. On their way to lysosomes, 
endocytosed materials must first pass through a series of compartments 
called endosomes, which sort the ingested molecules and recycle some 
of them back to the plasma membrane. Peroxisomes are small organelles 
that contain enzymes used in a variety of oxidative reactions that break 
down lipids and destroy toxic molecules. Mitochondria and (in plant cells) 
chloroplasts are each surrounded by a double membrane and are the sites 
of oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis, respectively (discussed 
in Chapter 14); both contain internal membranes that are highly special-
ized for the production of ATP.

Many  of  the  membrane-enclosed  organelles,  including  the  ER,  Golgi 
apparatus,  mitochondria,  and  chloroplasts,  are  held  in  their  rela-
tive  locations  in  the  cell  by  attachment  to  the  cytoskeleton,  especially 
to  microtubules.  Cytoskeletal  filaments  provide  tracks  for  moving  the 
organelles  around  and  for  directing  the  traffic  of  vesicles  between  one 
organelle and another. These movements are driven by motor proteins 
that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to propel the organelles and vesi-
cles along the filaments, as discussed in Chapter 17.

On average, the membrane-enclosed organelles together occupy nearly 
half the volume of a eukaryotic cell (Table 15–2), and the total amount of 
membrane associated with them is enormous. In a typical mammalian 
cell,  for  example,  the  area  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  membrane  is 
20–30 times greater than that of the plasma membrane. In terms of its 
area and mass, the plasma membrane is only a minor membrane in most 
eukaryotic cells.

Much can be learned about the composition and function of an organelle 
once it has been isolated from other cell structures. For the most part, 
organelles are far too small to be isolated by hand, but it is possible to 
separate one type of organelle from another by differential centrifugation 
(described in Panel 4–3, pp. 164–165). Once a purified sample of one type 
of organelle has been obtained, the organelle’s proteins can be identified. 
In many cases, the organelle itself can be incubated in a test tube under 
conditions that allow its functions to be studied. Isolated mitochondria, 
for example, can produce ATP from the oxidation of pyruvate to CO2 and 
water, provided they are adequately supplied with ADP, inorganic phos-
phate, and O2.

Figure 15–3 Nuclear membranes and 
the Er may have evolved through 
invagination of the plasma membrane. 
In bacteria, the single DNa molecule is 
typically attached to the plasma membrane. 
It is possible that in a very ancient 
prokaryotic cell, the plasma membrane, with 
its attached DNa, could have invaginated 
and, in subsequent generations, formed 
a two-layered envelope of membrane 
completely surrounding the DNa. this 
envelope is presumed to have eventually 
pinched off completely from the plasma 
membrane, ultimately producing a nuclear 
compartment penetrated by channels called 
nuclear pores, which enable communication 
with the cytosol. Other portions of the 
invaginated membrane may have formed 
the er, which would explain why the space 
between the inner and outer nuclear 
membranes is continuous with the er 
lumen.

Question 15–1

as shown in the drawings in  
Figure 15–3, the lipid bilayer 
of the inner and outer nuclear 
membranes forms a continuous 
sheet, joined around the nuclear 
pores. as membranes are two-
dimensional fluids, this would 
imply that membrane proteins can 
diffuse freely between the two 
nuclear membranes. Yet each of 
these two nuclear membranes has 
a different protein composition, 
reflecting different functions. How 
could you reconcile this apparent 
contradiction?

membrane-enclosed organelles evolved in different Ways
In trying to understand the relationships between the different compart-
ments  of  a  modern  eukaryotic  cell,  it  is  helpful  to  consider  how  they 
evolved. The compartments probably evolved in stages. The precursors 
of the first eukaryotic cells are thought to have been simple microorgan-
isms, resembling bacteria, which had a plasma membrane but no internal 
membranes. The plasma membrane in such cells would have provided all 
membrane-dependent functions, including ATP synthesis and lipid syn-
thesis, as does the plasma membrane in most modern bacteria. Bacteria 
can get by with this arrangement because of their small size, which gives 
them  a  high  surface-to-volume  ratio:  their  plasma  membrane  area  is 
thus sufficient to sustain all the vital functions for which membranes are 
required. Present-day eukaryotic cells, by contrast, have volumes 1000 
to 10,000 times greater than that of a typical bacterium such as E. coli. 
Such  a  large  cell  has  a  small  surface-to-volume  ratio  and  presumably 
could not survive with a plasma membrane as its only membrane. Thus, 
the increase in size typical of eukaryotic cells probably could not have 
occurred without the development of internal membranes.

Membrane-enclosed organelles are thought to have arisen in evolution 
in at least two ways. The nuclear membranes and the membranes of the 
ER, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and lysosomes most likely originated by 
invagination of the plasma membrane, as illustrated for the nuclear and 
ER  membranes  in  Figure  15–3.  The  ER,  Golgi  apparatus,  peroxisomes, 
endosomes,  and  lysosomes  are  all  part  of  what  is  collectively  called 
the endomembrane system. As we discuss later, the interiors of these 
organelles communicate extensively with one another and with the out-
side of the cell by means of small vesicles that bud off from one of these 
organelles and fuse with another. Consistent with this proposed evolu-
tionary origin, the interiors of these organelles are treated by the cell in 
many ways as “extracellular,” as we will see. The hypothetical scheme 
shown in Figure 15–3 also explains why the nucleus is surrounded by two 
membranes. 

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have originated in a differ-
ent way. They differ from all other organelles in that they possess their 
own small genomes and can make some of their own proteins, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 14. The similarity of their genomes to those of bacteria 
and the close resemblance of some of their proteins to bacterial proteins 
strongly  suggest  that  both  these  organelles  evolved  from  bacteria  that 
were engulfed by primitive pre-eukaryotic cells with which they initially 
lived  in  symbiosis  (Figure  15–4).  As  might  be  expected  from  their  ori-
gins, mitochondria and chloroplasts remain isolated from the extensive 
vesicular  traffic  that  connects  the  interiors  of  most  of  the  other  mem-
brane-enclosed organelles to one another and to the outside of the cell.

similar way, when a eukaryotic cell with 
mitochondria engulfed a photosynthetic 
prokaryote. this theory would explain why 
these organelles have two membranes, 
possess their own genomes, and do 
not participate in the vesicular traffic 
that connects the compartments of the 
endomembrane system.

Before a eukaryotic cell divides, it must duplicate its membrane-enclosed 
organelles.  As  cells  grow,  membrane-enclosed  organelles  enlarge  by 
incorporation of new molecules; the organelles then divide and, during 
cell division, are distributed between the two daughter cells. Organelle 
growth  requires  a  supply  of  new  lipids  to  make  more  membrane  and 
a supply of the appropriate proteins—both membrane proteins and the 
soluble  proteins  that  will  occupy  the  interior  of  the  organelle.  Even  in 
cells that are not dividing, proteins are being produced continually. These 
newly synthesized proteins must be accurately delivered to their appro-
priate  organelle—some  for  eventual  secretion  from  the  cell  and  some 
to replace organelle proteins that have been degraded. Directing newly 
made  proteins  to  their  correct  organelle  is  therefore  necessary  for  any 
cell to grow and divide, or just to function properly. 

ECB4 e15.04/15.04

For some organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, 
and the interior of the nucleus, proteins are delivered directly from the 
cytosol.  For  others,  including  the  Golgi  apparatus,  lysosomes,  endo-
somes, and the inner nuclear membrane, proteins and lipids are delivered 
indirectly via the ER, which is itself a major site of lipid and protein syn-
thesis. Proteins enter the ER directly from the cytosol: some are retained 
there,  but  most  are  transported  by  vesicles  to  the  Golgi  apparatus  and 
then onward to the plasma membrane or other organelles. Peroxisomes 
acquire some of their membrane proteins from the ER, but the bulk of 
their enzymes enter directly from the cytosol. 

In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  mechanisms  by  which  proteins  directly 
enter membrane-enclosed organelles from the cytosol. Proteins made in 
the cytosol are dispatched to different locations in the cell according to 
specific address labels contained in their amino acid sequence. Once at 
the correct address, the protein enters either the membrane or the inte-
rior lumen of its designated organelle.

proteins are transported into organelles by three 
mechanisms
The  synthesis  of  virtually  all  proteins  in  the  cell  begins  on  ribosomes 
in  the  cytosol.  The  exceptions  are  the  few  mitochondrial  and  chloro-
plast proteins that are synthesized on ribosomes inside these organelles; 
most mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins, however, are made in the 
cytosol  and  subsequently  imported.  The  fate  of  any  protein  molecule 
synthesized in the cytosol depends on its amino acid sequence, which 

can contain a sorting signal that directs the protein to the organelle in 
which it is required. Proteins that lack such signals remain as permanent 
residents in the cytosol; those that possess a sorting signal move from 
the cytosol to the appropriate organelle. Different sorting signals direct 
proteins into the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), peroxi-
somes, and the ER. 

When  a  membrane-enclosed  organelle  imports  a  water-soluble  pro-
tein to its interior—either from the cytosol or from another organelle—it 
faces a problem: how can it transport the protein across its membrane 
(or membranes), which are normally impermeable to hydrophilic mac-
romolecules?  This  task  is  accomplished  in  different  ways  by  different 
organelles. 

1.  Proteins moving from the cytosol into the nucleus are transported 
through  the  nuclear  pores,  which  penetrate  both  the  inner  and 
outer  nuclear  membranes.  The  pores  function  as  selective  gates 
that actively transport specific macromolecules but also allow free 
diffusion of smaller molecules (mechanism 1 in Figure 15–5). 

2.  Proteins  moving  from  the  cytosol  into  the  ER,  mitochondria,  or 
chloroplasts  are  transported  across  the  organelle  membrane  by 
protein  translocators  located  in  the  membrane.  Unlike  transport 
through nuclear pores, the transported protein must usually unfold 
in  order  to  snake  across  the  membrane  through  the  transloca-
tor  (mechanism  2  in  Figure  15–5).  Bacteria  have  similar  protein 
translocators in their plasma membrane, which they use to export 
proteins from the cytosol to the cell exterior.

3.  Proteins moving onward from the ER—and from one compartment 
of  the  endomembrane  system  to  another—are  transported  by  a 
mechanism that is fundamentally different. These proteins are fer-
ried by transport vesicles, which pinch off from the membrane of 
one compartment and then fuse with the membrane of a second

port vesicles deliver soluble cargo proteins, as well as the proteins 
and lipids that are part of the vesicle membrane.

signal sequences direct proteins to the correct 
compartment
The typical sorting signal on a protein is a continuous stretch of amino 
acid sequence, typically 15–60 amino acids long. This signal sequence is 
often (but not always) removed from the finished protein once it has been 
sorted. Some of the signal sequences used to specify different destina-
tions in the cell are shown in Table 15–3.

Signal sequences are both necessary and sufficient to direct a protein to 
a particular destination. This has been shown by experiments in which 
the sequence is either deleted or transferred from one protein to another 
by  genetic  engineering  techniques  (discussed  in  Chapter  10).  Deleting 
a  signal  sequence  from  an  ER  protein,  for  example,  converts  it  into  a 
cytosolic protein, while placing an ER signal sequence at the beginning of 
a cytosolic protein redirects the protein to the ER (Figure 15–6). The signal 
sequences specifying the same destination can vary greatly even though 
they have the same function: physical properties such as hydrophobicity

proteins enter the nucleus through nuclear pores
The nuclear envelope, which encloses the nuclear DNA and defines the 
nuclear compartment, is formed from two concentric membranes. The 
inner nuclear membrane contains some proteins that act as binding sites 
for  the  chromosomes  (discussed  in  Chapter  5)  and  others  that  provide 
anchorage for the nuclear lamina, a finely woven meshwork of protein fil-
aments that lines the inner face of this membrane and provides structural 
support for the nuclear envelope (discussed in Chapter 17). The composi-
tion of the outer nuclear membrane closely resembles the membrane of 
the ER, with which it is continuous (Figure 15–7).

The  nuclear  envelope  in  all  eukaryotic  cells  is  perforated  by  nuclear 
pores  that form the gates through which molecules enter or leave the 
nucleus.  A  nuclear  pore  is  a  large,  elaborate  structure  composed  of  a 
complex of about 30 different proteins (Figure 15–8). Many of the pro-
teins that line the nuclear pore contain extensive, unstructured regions 
in which the polypeptide chains are largely disordered. These disordered 
segments  form  a  soft,  tangled  meshwork—like  a  kelp  forest—that  fills 
the center of the channel, preventing the passage of large molecules but 
allowing  small,  water-soluble  molecules  to  pass  freely  and  nonselec-
tively between the nucleus and the cytosol. 

Selected larger molecules and macromolecular complexes also need to 
pass  through  nuclear  pores.  RNA  molecules,  which  are  synthesized  in 
the nucleus, and ribosomal subunits, which are assembled there, must 
be  exported  to  the  cytosol  (discussed  in  Chapter  7).  And  newly  made 
proteins  that  are  destined  for  the  nucleus  must  be  imported  from  the 
cytosol (Movie 15.1). To gain entry to a pore, these large molecules and

Figure 15–9 Prospective nuclear proteins are imported from

localization signal that is recognized by nuclear import receptors, 
which interact with the cytosolic fibrils that extend from the rim of the 
pore. as indicated by the short black arrows, after being captured, 
the receptors move randomly with their cargo through the gel-like 
meshwork of nuclear fibrils, until nuclear entry triggers cargo release. 
after cargo delivery, the receptors return to the cytosol via nuclear 
pores for reuse. Similar types of transport receptors, operating in 
the reverse direction, export mrNas from the nucleus (see Figure 
7–23). these sets of import and export receptors have a similar basic 
structure.

Figure 15–10 Energy supplied by gTP 
hydrolysis drives nuclear transport. 
a nuclear import receptor picks up a 
prospective nuclear protein in the cytosol 
and enters the nucleus. there it encounters 
a small monomeric Gtpase called ran, 
which carries a molecule of Gtp. this 
ran-Gtp binds to the import receptor, 
causing it to release the nuclear protein. 
having discharged its cargo in the nucleus, 
the receptor—still carrying ran-Gtp—is 
transported back through the pore to the 
cytosol. there, an accessory protein (not 
shown) triggers ran to hydrolyze its bound 
Gtp. ran-GDp falls off the import receptor, 
which is then free to bind another protein 
destined for the nucleus. a similar cycle 
operates to export mrNas and ribosomal 
subunits from the nucleus into the cytosol, 
using nuclear export receptors that 
recognize nuclear export signals  
(see table 15–3). 

macromolecular  complexes  must  display  an  appropriate  sorting  sig-
nal. The signal sequence that directs a protein from the cytosol into the 
nucleus, called a nuclear localization signal, typically consists of one or 
two  short  sequences  containing  several  positively  charged  lysines  or 
arginines (see Table 15–3).

The  nuclear  localization  signal  on  proteins  destined  for  the  nucleus  is 
recognized  by  cytosolic  proteins  called  nuclear  import  receptors.  These 
receptors  help  direct  a  newly  synthesized  protein  to  a  nuclear  pore  by 
interacting with the tentacle-like fibrils that extend from the rim of the 
pore into the cytosol (Figure 15–9). Once there, the nuclear import recep-
tor  penetrates  the  pore  by  grabbing  onto  short,  repeated  amino  acid 
sequences within the tangle of nuclear pore proteins that fill the center of 
the pore. When the nuclear pore is empty, these repeated sequences bind 
to one another, forming a loosely packed gel. Nuclear import receptors 
interrupt these interactions, and they open a local passageway through 
the meshwork. The import receptors simply bump along from one repeat 
sequence to the next, until they enter the nucleus and deliver their cargo. 
The empty receptor then returns to the cytosol via the nuclear pore for 
reuse (see Figure 15–9).

Like  any  process  that  creates  order,  the  import  of  nuclear  proteins 
requires energy. In this case, the energy is provided by the hydrolysis of 
GTP, mediated by a monomeric GTPase named Ran. This GTP hydrolysis 
drives nuclear transport in the appropriate direction, as shown in Figure 
15–10. Nuclear pore proteins operate this molecular gate at an amazing 
speed, rapidly pumping macromolecules in both directions through each 
pore.

Question 15–2

Why do eukaryotic cells require a 
nucleus as a separate compartment 
when prokaryotic cells can manage 
perfectly well without?

Nuclear pores transport proteins in their fully folded conformation and 
ribosomal components as assembled particles. This feature distinguishes 
the  nuclear  transport  mechanism  from  the  mechanisms  that  transport 
proteins into most other organelles. Proteins have to unfold to cross the 
membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, as we discuss next. 

proteins unfold to enter mitochondria and chloroplasts
Both mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by inner and outer 
membranes,  and  both  organelles  specialize  in  the  synthesis  of  ATP. 
Chloroplasts also contain a third membrane system, the thylakoid mem-
brane (discussed in Chapter 14). Although both organelles contain their 
own genomes and make some of their own proteins, most mitochondrial 
and  chloroplast  proteins  are  encoded  by  genes  in  the  nucleus  and  are 
imported from the cytosol. These proteins usually have a signal sequence 
at  their  N-terminus  that  allows  them  to  enter  their  specific  organelle. 
Proteins  destined  for  either  organelle  are  translocated  simultaneously 
across both the inner and outer membranes at specialized sites where 
the  two  membranes  contact  each  other.  Each  protein  is  unfolded  as  it 
is transported, and its signal sequence is removed after translocation is 
complete (Figure 15–11). 

Chaperone proteins (discussed in Chapter 4) inside the organelles help to 
pull the protein across the two membranes and to fold it once it is inside. 
Subsequent  transport  to  a  particular  site  within  the  organelle,  such  as 
the inner or outer membrane or the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts, 
usually  requires  further  sorting  signals  in  the  protein,  which  are  often 
only exposed after the first signal sequence has been removed. The inser-
tion of transmembrane proteins into the inner membrane, for example, is 
guided by signal sequences in the protein that start and stop the transfer 
process across the membrane, as we describe later for the insertion of 
transmembrane proteins in the ER membrane.

The growth and maintenance of mitochondria and chloroplasts require 
not only the import of new proteins but also the incorporation of new lip-
ids into the organelle membranes. Most of their membrane phospholipids 
are thought to be imported from the ER, which is the main site of lipid 
synthesis in the cell. Phospholipids are transported to these organelles

both of which must be crossed for a mitochondrial precursor protein to enter the organelle. (B) to initiate transport, the mitochondrial 
signal sequence on a mitochondrial precursor protein is recognized by a receptor in the outer mitochondrial membrane. this receptor 
is associated with a protein translocator. the complex of receptor, precursor protein, and translocator diffuses laterally in the outer 
membrane until it encounters a second translocator in the inner membrane. the two translocators then transport the protein across 
both the outer and inner membranes, unfolding the protein in the process (Movie 15.2). the signal sequence is finally cleaved off by a 
signal peptidase in the mitochondrial matrix. proteins are imported into chloroplasts by a similar mechanism. the chaperone proteins 
that help pull the protein across the membranes and help it to refold are not shown.

by lipid-carrying proteins that extract a phospholipid molecule from one 
membrane and deliver it into another. Such transport may occur at spe-
cific junctions where mitochondrial and ER membranes are held in close 
proximity. Thanks to these lipid-carrying proteins, the different cell mem-
branes are able to maintain different lipid compositions.

proteins enter peroxisomes from both the cytosol and the 
endoplasmic reticulum 
Peroxisomes  generally  contain  one  or  more  enzymes  that  produce 
hydrogen peroxide, hence their name. These organelles are present in all 
eukaryotic cells, where they break down a variety of molecules, including 
toxins, alcohol, and fatty acids. They also synthesize certain phospholip-
ids, including those that are abundant in the myelin sheath that insulates 
nerve cell axons. 

Peroxisomes  acquire  the  bulk  of  their  proteins  via  selective  transport 
from the cytosol. A short sequence of only three amino acids serves as an 
import signal for many peroxisomal proteins. This sequence is recognized 
by receptor proteins in the cytosol, at least one of which escorts its cargo 
protein all the way into the peroxisome before returning to the cytosol. 
Like the membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the peroxisomal 
membrane  contains  a  protein  translocator  that  aids  in  the  transport. 
Unlike the mechanism that operates in mitochondria and chloroplasts, 
however, proteins do not need to unfold to enter the peroxisome—and 
the transport mechanism is still mysterious.

Although most peroxisomal proteins—including those embedded in the 
peroxisomal membrane—come from the cytosol, a few membrane pro-
teins  arrive  via  vesicles  that  bud  from  the  ER  membrane.  The  vesicles 
either fuse with preexisting peroxisomes or import peroxisomal proteins 
from the cytosol to grow into mature peroxisomes.  

The  most  severe  peroxisomal  disease,  called  Zellweger  syndrome,  is 
caused by mutations that block peroxisomal protein import. Individuals 
with this disorder are born with severe abnormalities in their brain, liver, 
and kidneys. Most do not survive past the first six months of life—a grim 
reminder of the crucial importance of these underappreciated organelles 
for proper cell function and for the health of the organism. 

proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum While being 
synthesized
The endoplasmic reticulum is the most extensive membrane system in a 
eukaryotic cell (Figure 15–12a). Unlike the organelles discussed so far, it 
serves as an entry point for proteins destined for other organelles, as well 
as for the ER itself. Proteins destined for the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, 
and lysosomes, as well as proteins destined for the cell surface, all first 
enter the ER from the cytosol. Once inside the ER lumen, or embedded in 
the ER membrane, individual proteins will not re-enter the cytosol during 
their onward journey. They will instead be ferried by transport vesicles 
from organelle to organelle within the endomembrane system, or to the 
plasma membrane.

Two kinds of proteins are transferred from the cytosol to the ER: (1) water-
soluble  proteins  are  completely  translocated  across  the  ER  membrane 
and are released into the ER lumen; (2) prospective transmembrane pro-
teins are only partly translocated across the ER membrane and become 
embedded in it. The water-soluble proteins are destined either for secre-
tion (by release at the cell surface) or for the lumen of an organelle of 
the  endomembrane  system.  The  transmembrane  proteins  are  destined

to reside in the membrane of one of these organelles or in the plasma 
membrane. All of these proteins are initially directed to the ER by an ER 
signal  sequence,  a  segment  of  eight  or  more  hydrophobic  amino  acids 
(see Table 15–3, p. 494), which is also involved in the process of translo-
cation across the membrane.

ECB4 e15.12/15.12

Unlike  the  proteins  that  enter  the  nucleus,  mitochondria,  chloroplasts, 
or  peroxisomes,  most  of  the  proteins  that  enter  the  ER  begin  to  be 
threaded across the ER membrane before the polypeptide chain has been 
completely  synthesized.  This  requires  that  the  ribosome  synthesizing 
the protein be attached to the ER membrane. These membrane-bound 
ribosomes  coat  the  surface  of  the  ER,  creating  regions  termed  rough 
endoplasmic reticulum because of its characteristic beaded appearance 
when viewed in an electron microscope (Figure 15–12b).

There are, therefore, two separate populations of ribosomes in the cytosol. 
Membrane-bound ribosomes are attached to the cytosolic side of the ER 
membrane (and outer nuclear membrane) and are making proteins that 
are  being  translocated  into  the  ER.  Free  ribosomes  are  unattached  to 
any membrane and are making all of the other proteins encoded by the 
nuclear DNA. Membrane-bound ribosomes and free ribosomes are struc-
turally and functionally identical; they differ only in the proteins they are 
making  at  any  given  time.  When  a  ribosome  happens  to  be  making  a 
protein with an ER signal sequence, the signal sequence directs the ribos-
ome to the ER membrane. Because proteins with an ER signal sequence 
are translocated as they are being made, no additional energy is required 
for their transport; the elongation of each polypeptide provides the thrust 
needed to push the growing chain through the ER membrane. 

As an mRNA molecule is translated, many ribosomes bind to it, forming 
a  polyribosome  (discussed  in  Chapter  7).  In  the  case  of  an  mRNA  mol-
ecule encoding a protein with an ER signal sequence, the polyribosome 
becomes riveted to the ER membrane by the growing polypeptide chains, 
which have become inserted into the ER membrane (Figure 15–13).

soluble proteins made on the er are released into the  
er lumen

brane: (1) a signal-recognition particle (SRP), present in the cytosol, binds

ribosomes that are translating proteins 
with no er signal sequence remain free in 
the cytosol. ribosomes that are translating 
proteins containing an er signal sequence

Many ribosomes bind to each mrNa 
molecule, forming a polyribosome. at the 
end of each round of protein synthesis, the 
ribosomal subunits are released and rejoin 
the common pool in the cytosol. as we 
see shortly, how the ribosome and signal 
sequence bind to the er and translocation 
channel is more complicated than illustrated 
here.

to both the ribosome and the ER signal sequence when it emerges from 
the ribosome, and (2) an SRP receptor, embedded in the ER membrane, 
recognizes  the  SRP.  Binding  of  an  SRP  to  a  ribosome  that  displays  an 
ER  signal  sequence  slows  protein  synthesis  by  that  ribosome  until  the 
SRP engages with an SRP receptor on the ER. Once bound, the SRP is 
released, the receptor passes the ribosome to a protein translocator in 
the  ER  membrane,  and  protein  synthesis  recommences.  The  polypep-
tide is then threaded across the ER membrane through a channel in the 
translocator (Figure 15–14). Thus the SRP and SRP receptor function as 
molecular  matchmakers,  uniting  ribosomes  that  are  synthesizing  pro-
teins with an ER signal sequence and available translocation channels in 
the ER membrane.

In addition to directing proteins to the ER, the signal sequence—which 
for soluble proteins is almost always at the N-terminus, the end synthe-
sized first—functions to open the channel in the protein translocator. This 
sequence remains bound to the channel, while the rest of the polypeptide 
chain is threaded through the membrane as a large loop. It is removed 
by a transmembrane signal peptidase, which has an active site facing the 
lumenal side of the ER membrane. The cleaved signal sequence is then 
released from the translocation channel into the lipid bilayer and rapidly 
degraded. 

Once the C-terminus of a soluble protein has passed through the trans-
location channel, the protein will be released into the ER lumen (Figure 
15–15).

the ribosome, thereby slowing protein 
synthesis by the ribosome. the Srp–

receptor in the er membrane. the Srp

the Srp receptor to a protein translocator 
in the er membrane. protein synthesis 
resumes, and the translocator starts to 
transfer the growing polypeptide across 
the lipid bilayer.

start and stop signals determine the arrangement of a

Not all proteins made by ER-bound ribosomes are released into the ER 
lumen. Some remain embedded in the ER membrane as transmembrane 
proteins. The translocation process for such proteins is more complicated 
than it is for soluble proteins, as some parts of the polypeptide chain must 
be translocated completely across the lipid bilayer, whereas other parts 
remain fixed in the membrane.

ECB4 E15.14/15.14

In  the  simplest  case,  that  of  a  transmembrane  protein  with  a  single 
membrane-spanning segment, the N-terminal signal sequence initiates 
translocation—as  it  does  for  a  soluble  protein.  But  the  transfer  proc-
ess is halted by an additional sequence of hydrophobic amino acids, a 
stop-transfer sequence, further along the polypeptide chain. At this point, 
the translocation channel releases the growing polypeptide chain side-
ways  into  the  lipid  bilayer.  The  N-terminal  signal  sequence  is  cleaved 
off, whereas the stop-transfer sequence remains in the bilayer, where it 
forms an α-helical membrane-spanning segment that anchors the pro-
tein in the membrane. As a result, the protein ends up as a single-pass 
transmembrane protein inserted in the membrane with a defined orien-
tation—the N-terminus on the lumenal side of the lipid bilayer and the 
C-terminus on the cytosolic side (Figure 15–16). Once inserted into the 
membrane,  a  transmembrane  protein  does  not  change  its  orientation, 
which is retained throughout any subsequent vesicle budding and fusion 
events.

In some transmembrane proteins, an internal, rather than an N-terminal, 
signal  sequence  is  used  to  start  the  protein  transfer;  this  internal  sig-
nal  sequence,  called  a  start-transfer  sequence,  is  never  removed  from

Figure 15–16 a single-pass 
transmembrane protein is retained 
in the lipid bilayer. an N-terminal 
er signal sequence (red) initiates 
transfer as in Figure 15–15. In 
addition, the protein also contains 
a second hydrophobic sequence, 
which acts as a stop-transfer sequence 
(orange). When this sequence 
enters the translocation channel, 
the channel discharges the growing 
polypeptide chain sideways into the 
lipid bilayer. the N-terminal signal 
sequence is cleaved off, leaving the 
transmembrane protein anchored in 
the membrane (Movie 15.4). protein 
synthesis on the cytosolic side then 
continues to completion. 

Question 15–4

a.  predict the membrane 
orientation of a protein that is 
synthesized with an uncleaved, 
internal signal sequence (shown as 
the red start-transfer sequence in 
Figure 15–17) but does not contain a 
stop-transfer sequence. 
b.  similarly, predict the membrane 
orientation of a protein that is 
synthesized with an n-terminal 
cleaved signal sequence followed by 
a stop-transfer sequence, followed 
by a start-transfer sequence. 
c.  What arrangement of signal 
sequences would enable the 
insertion of a multipass protein with 
an odd number of transmembrane 
segments?

Figure 15–17 a double-pass 
transmembrane protein has an internal 
Er signal sequence. this internal 
sequence (red ) not only acts as a start-
transfer signal, it also helps to anchor 
the final protein in the membrane. Like 
the N-terminal er signal sequence, the 
internal signal sequence is recognized 
by an Srp, which brings the ribosome to 
the er membrane (not shown). When a 
stop-transfer sequence (orange) enters 
the translocation channel, the channel 
discharges both sequences into the lipid 
bilayer. Neither the start-transfer nor the 
stop-transfer sequence is cleaved off, 
and the entire polypeptide chain remains 
anchored in the membrane as a double-
pass transmembrane protein. proteins that 
span the membrane more times contain 
further pairs of start- and stop-transfer 
sequences, and the same process is 
repeated for each pair.

the polypeptide. This arrangement occurs in some transmembrane pro-
teins  in  which  the  polypeptide  chain  passes  back  and  forth  across  the 
lipid bilayer. In these cases, hydrophobic signal sequences are thought 
to  work  in  pairs:  an  internal  start-transfer  sequence  serves  to  initiate 
translocation, which continues until a stop-transfer sequence is reached; 
the two hydrophobic sequences are then released into the bilayer, where 
they  remain  as  membrane-spanning α  helices  (Figure  15–17).  In  com-
plex multipass proteins, in which many hydrophobic α helices span the 
bilayer, additional pairs of start- and stop-transfer sequences come into 
play: one sequence reinitiates translocation further down the polypeptide 
chain, and the other stops translocation and causes polypeptide release, 
and so on for subsequent starts and stops. Thus, multipass membrane 
proteins are stitched into the lipid bilayer as they are being synthesized, 
by a mechanism resembling the workings of a sewing machine.

vesicular transport
Entry  into  the  ER  lumen  or  membrane  is  usually  only  the  first  step  on 
a  pathway  to  another  destination.  That  destination,  initially  at  least,  is 
generally the Golgi apparatus; there, proteins and lipids are modified and 
sorted  for  shipment  to  other  sites.  Transport  from  the  ER  to  the  Golgi 
apparatus—and from the Golgi apparatus to other compartments of the 
endomembrane  system—is  carried  out  by  the  continual  budding  and 
fusion of transport vesicles. This vesicular  transport extends outward 
from the ER to the plasma membrane, and inward from the plasma mem-
brane to lysosomes, and thus provides routes of communication between 
the  interior  of  the  cell  and  its  surroundings.  As  proteins  and  lipids  are 
transported outward along these pathways, many of them undergo vari-
ous types of chemical modification, such as the addition of carbohydrate 
side chains.

In this section, we discuss how vesicles shuttle proteins and membranes 
between  intracellular  compartments,  allowing  cells  to  eat,  drink,  and 
secrete.  We  also  consider  how  these  transport  vesicles  are  directed  to 
their proper destination, be it an organelle of the endomembrane system 
or the plasma membrane. 

transport vesicles carry soluble proteins and membrane 
between compartments
Vesicular  transport  between  membrane-enclosed  compartments  of  the 
endomembrane  system  is  highly  organized.  A  major  outward  secre-
tory pathway starts with the synthesis of proteins on the ER membrane 
and their entry into the ER, and it leads through the Golgi apparatus to 
the cell surface; at the Golgi apparatus, a side branch leads off through 
endosomes  to  lysosomes.  A  major  inward  endocytic  pathway,  which  is 
responsible for the ingestion and degradation of extracellular molecules, 
moves  materials  from  the  plasma  membrane,  through  endosomes,  to 
lysosomes (Figure 15–18).
To function optimally, each transport vesicle that buds off from a com-
partment must take with it only the proteins appropriate to its destination 
and  must  fuse  only  with  the  appropriate  target  membrane.  A  vesicle 
carrying  cargo  from  the  Golgi  apparatus  to  the  plasma  membrane,  for 
example, must exclude proteins that are to stay in the Golgi apparatus,

the plasma membrane or (via early and 
late endosomes) to lysosomes. In the 
inward endocytic pathway (green arrows), 
extracellular molecules are ingested 
(endocytosed) in vesicles derived from 
the plasma membrane and are delivered 
to early endosomes and, usually, on to 
lysosomes via late endosomes.

and it must fuse only with the plasma membrane and not with any other 
organelle. While participating in this constant flow of membrane compo-
nents, each organelle must maintain its own distinct identity, that is, its 
own  distinctive  protein  and  lipid  composition.  All  of  these  recognition 
events depend on proteins displayed on the surface of the transport vesi-
cle. As we will see, different types of transport vesicles shuttle between 
the various organelles, each carrying a distinct set of molecules.

vesicle budding is driven by the assembly of a protein 
coat
Vesicles that bud from membranes usually have a distinctive protein coat 
on their cytosolic surface and are therefore called coated vesicles. After 
budding from its parent organelle, the vesicle sheds its coat, allowing its 
membrane to interact directly with the membrane to which it will fuse. 
Cells  produce  several  kinds  of  coated  vesicles,  each  with  a  distinctive 
protein coat. The coat serves at least two functions: it helps shape the 
membrane into a bud and captures molecules for onward transport.

The best-studied vesicles are those that have an outer coat made of the 
protein clathrin. These clathrin-coated vesicles bud from both the Golgi 
apparatus on the outward secretory pathway and from the plasma mem-
brane on the inward endocytic pathway. At the plasma membrane, for 
example,  each  vesicle  starts  off  as  a  clathrin-coated  pit.  Clathrin  mole-
cules assemble into a basketlike network on the cytosolic surface of the 
membrane, and it is this assembly process that starts shaping the mem-
brane into a vesicle (Figure 15–19). A small GTP-binding protein called

Figure 15–20 Clathrin-coated vesicles 
transport selected cargo molecules. here, 
as in Figure 15–19, the vesicles are shown 
budding from the plasma membrane. 
cargo receptors, with their bound cargo 
molecules, are captured by adaptins, which 
also bind clathrin molecules to the cytosolic 
surface of the budding vesicle (Movie 15.5). 
Dynamin proteins assemble around the 
neck of budding vesicles; once assembled, 
the dynamin molecules—which are 
monomeric Gtpases (discussed in chapter 
16)—hydrolyze their bound Gtp and, with 
the help of other proteins recruited to the 
neck (not shown), pinch off the vesicle. after 
budding is complete, the coat proteins are 
removed, and the naked vesicle can fuse 
with its target membrane. Functionally 
similar coat proteins are found in other 
types of coated vesicles. 

dynamin assembles as a ring around the neck of each deeply invaginated 
coated pit. Together with other proteins recruited to the neck of the vesi-
cle,  the  dynamin  causes  the  ring  to  constrict,  thereby  pinching  off  the 
vesicle from its parent membrane. Other kinds of transport vesicles, with 
different  coat  proteins,  are  also  involved  in  vesicular  transport.  They 
form in a similar way and carry their own characteristic sets of molecules 
between the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the plasma 
membrane. But how does a transport vesicle select its particular cargo? 
The mechanism is best understood for clathrin-coated vesicles.

ECB4 E15.20/15.20

Clathrin itself plays no part in choosing specific molecules for transport. 
This  is  the  function  of  a  second  class  of  coat  proteins  called  adaptins, 
which both secure the clathrin coat to the vesicle membrane and help 
select  cargo  molecules  for  transport.  Molecules  for  onward  transport 
carry specific transport signals that are recognized by cargo receptors in 
the  Golgi  or  plasma  membrane.  Adaptins  help  capture  specific  cargo 
molecules by trapping the cargo receptors that bind them. In this way, 
a  selected  set  of  cargo  molecules,  bound  to  their  specific  receptors,  is 
incorporated into the lumen of each newly formed clathrin-coated vesi-
cle (Figure 15–20). There are different types of adaptins: the adaptins that 
bind cargo receptors in the plasma membrane, for example, are not the 
same as those that bind cargo receptors in the Golgi apparatus, reflect-
ing the differences in the cargo molecules to be transported from each of 
these sources.

Another class of coated vesicles, called COP-coated vesicles (COP being 
shorthand  for  “coat  protein”),  is  involved  in  transporting  molecules 
between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and from one part of the Golgi 
apparatus to another (Table 15–4).

vesicle docking depends on tethers and snares
After a transport vesicle buds from a membrane, it must find its way to 
its correct destination to deliver its contents. Often, the vesicle is actively 
transported by motor proteins that move along cytoskeletal fibers, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 17.

Once  a  transport  vesicle  has  reached  its  target,  it  must  recognize  and 
dock with its specific organelle. Only then can the vesicle membrane fuse 
with the target membrane and unload the vesicle’s cargo. The impressive 
specificity of vesicular transport suggests that each type of transport vesi-
cle in the cell displays molecular markers on its surface that identify the 
vesicle according to its origin and cargo. These markers must be recog-
nized by complementary receptors on the appropriate target membrane, 
including the plasma membrane. 

The  identification  process  depends  on  a  diverse  family  of  monomeric 
GTPases  called  Rab  proteins.  Specific  Rab  proteins  on  the  surface  of 
each type of vesicle are recognized by corresponding tethering proteins 
on the cytosolic surface of the target membrane. Each organelle and each 
type of transport vesicle carries a unique combination of Rab proteins, 
which serve as molecular markers for each membrane type. The coding 
system of matching Rab and tethering proteins helps to ensure that trans-
port vesicles fuse only with the correct membrane. 

Additional  recognition  is  provided  by  a  family  of  transmembrane  pro-
teins called SNAREs. Once the tethering protein has captured a vesicle by 
grabbing hold of its Rab protein, SNAREs on the vesicle (called v-SNAREs) 
interact  with  complementary  SNAREs  on  the  target  membrane  (called 
t-SNAREs), firmly docking the vesicle in place (Figure 15–21). 
The same SNAREs involved in docking also play a central role in catalyz-
ing  the  membrane  fusion  required  for  a  transport  vesicle  to  deliver  its 
cargo. Fusion not only delivers the soluble contents of the vesicle into the 
interior of the target organelle, but it also adds the vesicle membrane to 
the membrane of the organelle (see Figure 15–21). After vesicle docking,

Question 15–5

the budding of clathrin-coated 
vesicles from eukaryotic plasma 
membrane fragments can be 
observed when adaptins, clathrin, 
and dynamin-gtp are added to the 
membrane preparation. What  
would you observe if you omitted  
(a) adaptins, (b) clathrin, or  
(c) dynamin? (d) What would  
you observe if the plasma 
membrane fragments were from  
a prokaryotic cell?

Figure 15–21 rab proteins, tethering 
proteins, and sNarEs help direct 
transport vesicles to their target 
membranes. a filamentous tethering 
protein on a membrane binds to a rab 
protein on the surface of a vesicle. this 
interaction allows the vesicle to dock on its 
particular target membrane. a v-SNare on 
the vesicle then binds to a complementary 
t-SNare on the target membrane. Whereas 
rab and tethering proteins provide the 
initial recognition between a vesicle and its 
target membrane, complementary SNare 
proteins ensure that transport vesicles dock 
at their appropriate target membranes. 
these SNare proteins also catalyze the final 
fusion of the two membranes (see Figure 
15–22).

Secretory pathways         

507

Figure 15–22 Following vesicle docking, 
sNarE proteins can catalyze the fusion 
of the vesicle and target membranes. 
Once appropriately triggered, the tight 
pairing of v-SNares and t-SNares 
draws the two lipid bilayers into close 
apposition. the force of the SNares 
winding together squeezes out any water 
molecules that remain trapped between 
the two membranes, allowing their lipids 
to flow together to form a continuous 
bilayer. In a cell, other proteins recruited 
to the fusion site help to complete the 
fusion process. after fusion, the SNares 
are pried apart so that they can be used 
again.

the  fusion  of  a  vesicle  with  its  target  membrane  sometimes  requires  a 
special stimulatory signal. Whereas docking requires only that the two 
membranes come close enough for the SNAREs protruding from the two 
lipid  bilayers  to  interact,  fusion  requires  a  much  closer  approach:  the 
two bilayers must come within 1.5 nm of each other so that their lipids 
can intermix. For this close approach, water must be displaced from the 
hydrophilic surfaces of the membranes—a process that is energetically 
highly unfavorable and thus prevents membranes from fusing randomly. 
All  membrane  fusions  in  cells  must  therefore  be  catalyzed  by  special-
ized  proteins  that  assemble  to  form  a  fusion  complex,  which  provides 
the means to cross this energy barrier. The SNARE proteins themselves 
catalyze the fusion process: once fusion is triggered, the v-SNAREs and 
t-SNAREs wrap around each other, thereby acting like a winch that pulls 
the two lipid bilayers into close proximity (Figure 15–22).

Vesicular  traffic  is  not  confined  to  the  interior  of  the  cell.  It  extends  to 
and from the plasma membrane. Newly made proteins, lipids, and car-
bohydrates are delivered from the ER, via the Golgi apparatus, to the cell 
surface by transport vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane in the 
process of exocytosis (see Figure 15–18). Each molecule that travels along 
this route passes through a fixed sequence of membrane-enclosed com-
partments and is often chemically modified en route.

In this section, we follow the outward path of proteins as they travel from 
the ER, where they are made and modified, through the Golgi apparatus, 
where  they  are  further  modified  and  sorted,  to  the  plasma  membrane. 
As a protein passes from one compartment to another, it is monitored 
to check that it has folded properly and assembled with its appropriate 
partners, so that only correctly built proteins make it to the cell surface. 
Incorrect assemblies, which are often in the majority, are degraded inside 
the cell. Quality, it seems, is more important than economy when it comes 
to the production and transport of proteins via this pathway.

most proteins are covalently modified in the er
Most proteins that enter the ER are chemically modified there. Disulfide 
bonds are formed by the oxidation of pairs of cysteine side chains (see 
Figure 4–30), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme that resides in the ER 
lumen.  The  disulfide  bonds  help  to  stabilize  the  structure  of  proteins 
that will encounter degradative enzymes and changes in pH outside the 
cell—either after they are secreted or after they are incorporated into the 
plasma membrane. Disulfide bonds do not form in the cytosol because 
the environment there is reducing.

Many of the proteins that enter the ER lumen or ER membrane are con-
verted  to  glycoproteins  in  the  ER  by  the  covalent  attachment  of  short 

508 

ChaPTEr 15     Intracellular compartments and protein transport

branched oligosaccharide side chains composed of multiple sugars. This 
process of glycosylation is carried out by glycosylating enzymes present 
in the ER but not in the cytosol. Very few proteins in the cytosol are gly-
cosylated, and those that are have only a single sugar attached to them. 
The oligosaccharides on proteins can serve various functions. They can 
protect a protein from degradation, hold it in the ER until it is properly 
folded, or help guide it to the appropriate organelle by serving as a trans-
port signal for packaging the protein into appropriate transport vesicles. 
When  displayed  on  the  cell  surface,  oligosaccharides  form  part  of  the 
cell’s outer carbohydrate layer or glycocalyx (see Figure 11–33) and can 
function in the recognition of one cell by another.

In the ER, individual sugars are not added one-by-one to the protein to 
create  the  oligosaccharide  side  chain.  Instead,  a  preformed,  branched 
oligosaccharide containing a total of 14 sugars is attached en bloc to all 
proteins that carry the appropriate site for glycosylation. The oligosac-
charide  is  originally  attached  to  a  specialized  lipid,  called  dolichol,  in 
the ER membrane; it is then transferred to the amino (NH2) group of an 
asparagine side chain on the protein, immediately after a target aspar-
agine  emerges  in  the  ER  lumen  during  protein  translocation  (Figure 
15–23). The addition takes place in a single enzymatic step that is cata-
lyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme (an oligosaccharyl transferase) that 
has its active site exposed on the lumenal side of the ER membrane—
which explains why cytosolic proteins are not glycosylated in this way. 
A  simple  sequence  of  three  amino  acids,  of  which  the  asparagine  is 
one, defines which asparagines in a protein receive the oligosaccharide. 
Oligosaccharide side chains linked to an asparagine NH2 group in a pro-
tein  are  said  to  be  N-linked  and  are  by  far  the  most  common  type  of 
linkage found on glycoproteins.

The  addition  of the  14-sugar oligosaccharide in  the ER  is  only  the  first 
step  in  a  series  of  further  modifications  before  the  mature  glycopro-
tein reaches the cell surface. Despite their initial similarity, the N-linked

Question 15–6

Why might it be advantageous to 
add a preassembled block of 14 
sugar residues to a protein in the 
er, rather than building the sugar 
chains step-by-step on the surface 
of the protein by the sequential 
addition of sugars by individual 
enzymes?

Figure 15–23 Many proteins are 
glycosylated on asparagines in the Er. 
When an appropriate asparagine enters 
the er lumen, it is glycosylated by addition 
of a branched oligosaccharide side chain. 
each oligosaccharide chain is transferred as 
an intact unit to the asparagine from a lipid 
called dolichol, catalyzed by the enzyme 
oligosaccharyl transferase. asparagines that 
are glycosylated are always present in the 
tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine 
or asparagine-X-threonine, where X can be 
almost any amino acid. 

Secretory pathways

oligosaccharides on mature glycoproteins are remarkably diverse. All of 
the diversity results from extensive modification of the original precursor 
structure shown in Figure 15–23. This oligosaccharide processing begins 
in the ER and continues in the Golgi apparatus.

exit from the er is controlled to ensure protein Quality
Some proteins made in the ER are destined to function there. They are 
retained in the ER (and are returned to the ER whenever they escape to 
the Golgi apparatus) by a C-terminal sequence of four amino acids called 
an  ER  retention  signal  (see  Table  15–3,  p.  494).  This  retention  signal  is 
recognized by a membrane-bound receptor protein in the ER and Golgi 
apparatus.  Most  proteins  that  enter  the  ER,  however,  are  destined  for 
other locations; they are packaged into transport vesicles that bud from 
the ER and fuse with the Golgi apparatus. 

Exit from the ER is highly selective. Proteins that fail to fold correctly, and 
dimeric or multimeric proteins that do not assemble properly, are actively 
retained in the ER by binding to chaperone proteins that reside there. The 
chaperones hold these proteins in the ER until proper folding or assembly 
occurs. Chaperones prevent misfolded proteins from aggregating, which 
helps  steer  proteins  along  a  path  toward  proper  folding  (Figure  15–24 
and see Figures 4–9 and 4–10); if proper folding and assembly still fail, the 
proteins are exported to the cytosol, where they are degraded. Antibody 
molecules,  for  example,  are  composed  of  four  polypeptide  chains  (see 
Figure 4–33) that assemble into the complete antibody molecule in the 
ER.  Partially  assembled  antibodies  are  retained  in  the  ER  until  all  four 
polypeptide chains have assembled; any antibody molecule that fails to 
assemble properly is degraded. In this way, the ER controls the quality of 
the proteins that it exports to the Golgi apparatus.

Sometimes, however, this quality control mechanism can be detrimen-
tal to the organism. For example, the predominant mutation that causes 
the  common  genetic  disease  cystic  fibrosis,  which  leads  to  severe  lung 
damage, produces a plasma-membrane transport protein that is slightly 
misfolded; even though the mutant protein could function normally as a 
chloride channel if it reached the plasma membrane, it is retained in the 
ER, with dire consequences. Thus this devastating disease comes about 
not because the mutation inactivates an important protein but because 
the active protein is discarded by the cells before it is given an opportu-
nity to function.

the size of the er is controlled by the demand for protein 
Although  chaperones  help  proteins  in  the  ER  fold  properly  and  retain 
those that do not, this quality control system can become overwhelmed. 
When  that  happens,  misfolded  proteins  accumulate  in  the  ER.  If  the 
buildup is large enough, it triggers a complex program called the unfolded 
protein response (UPR). This program prompts the cell to produce more

transport vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. 
If the misfolded proteins fail to refold 
normally, they are transported back into the 
cytosol, where they are degraded  
(not shown).

The UPR allows a cell to adjust the size of its ER according to the load of 
proteins entering the secretory pathway. In some cases, however, even 
an expanded ER cannot cope, and the UPR directs the cell to self-destruct 
by  undergoing  apoptosis.  Such  a  situation  may  occur  in  adult-onset 
diabetes, where tissues gradually become resistant to the effects of insu-
lin. To compensate for this resistance, the insulin-secreting cells in the 
pancreas produce more and more insulin. Eventually, their ER reaches 
a maximum capacity, at which point the UPR can trigger cell death. As 
more insulin-secreting cells are eliminated, the demand on the surviving 
cells increases, making it more likely that they will die as well, further 
exacerbating the disease.

proteins are Further modified and sorted in the golgi 
apparatus
The Golgi apparatus is usually located near the cell nucleus, and in ani-
mal cells it is often close to the centrosome, a small cytoskeletal structure 
near the cell center (see Figure 17–12). The Golgi apparatus consists of 
a  collection  of  flattened,  membrane-enclosed  sacs  called  cisternae, 
which are piled like stacks of pita bread. Each stack contains 3–20 cis-
ternae (Figure 15–26). The number of Golgi stacks per cell varies greatly 
depending on the cell type: some cells contain one large stack, while oth-
ers contain hundreds of very small ones.

Each Golgi stack has two distinct faces: an entry, or cis, face and an exit, 
or  trans,  face.  The  cis  face  is  adjacent  to  the  ER,  while  the  trans  face 
points  toward  the  plasma  membrane.  The  outermost  cisterna  at  each 
face is connected to a network of interconnected membranous tubes and 
vesicles (see Figure 15–26A). Soluble proteins and membrane enter the 
cis Golgi network via transport vesicles derived from the ER. The proteins 
travel through the cisternae in sequence by means of transport vesicles 
that  bud  from  one  cisterna  and  fuse  with  the  next.  Proteins  exit  from 
the trans Golgi network in transport vesicles destined for either the cell 
surface or another organelle of the endomembrane system (see Figure 
15–18). 

Both  the  cis  and  trans  Golgi  networks  are  thought  to  be  important  for 
protein sorting: proteins entering the cis Golgi network can either move 
onward through the Golgi stack or, if they contain an ER retention signal, 
be returned to the ER; proteins exiting from the trans Golgi network are 
sorted according to whether they are destined for lysosomes (via endo-
somes) or for the cell surface. We discuss some examples of sorting by

know, pp. 512–513.

Many of the oligosaccharide chains that are added to proteins in the ER 
(see Figure 15–23) undergo further modifications in the Golgi apparatus. 
On  some  proteins,  for  example,  more  complex  oligosaccharide  chains 
are created by a highly ordered process in which sugars are added and 
removed by a series of enzymes that act in a rigidly determined sequence 
as the protein passes through the Golgi stack. As would be expected, the 
enzymes that act early in the chain of processing events are located in 
cisternae close to the cis face, while enzymes that act late are located in 
cisternae near the trans face.

secretory proteins are released from the cell by 
exocytosis
In  all  eukaryotic  cells,  a  steady  stream  of  vesicles  buds  from  the  trans 
Golgi  network  and  fuses  with  the  plasma  membrane  in  the  process  of 
exocytosis.  This  constitutive  exocytosis  pathway  supplies  the  plasma 
membrane with newly made lipids and proteins (Movie 15.7), enabling 
the plasma membrane to expand prior to cell division and refreshing old 
lipids  and  proteins  in  nonproliferating  cells.  The  constitutive  pathway 
also carries soluble proteins to the cell surface to be released to the out-
side, a process called secretion. Some of these proteins remain attached 
to the cell surface; some are incorporated into the extracellular matrix; 
still others diffuse into the extracellular fluid to nourish or signal other 
cells.  Entry  into  the  constitutive  pathway  does  not  require  a  particular 
signal sequence like those that direct proteins to endosomes or back to 
the ER.

ECB4 E15.26/15.26

In addition to the constitutive exocytosis pathway, which operates con-
tinually  in  all  eukaryotic  cells,  there  is  a  regulated  exocytosis  pathway, 
which  operates  only  in  cells  that  are  specialized  for  secretion.  Each 
specialized secretory cell produces large quantities of a particular prod-
uct—such as a hormone, mucus, or digestive enzymes—which is stored in

Over  the  years,  biologists  have  taken  advantage  of 
a  variety  of  techniques  to  untangle  the  pathways

transported  into  and  out  of  the  cell  and  its  resident 
organelles.  Biochemical,  genetic,  molecular  biological,

Figure 15–27 several methods can be used to determine 
whether a labeled protein bearing a particular signal 
sequence is transported into a preparation of isolated 
organelles. (a) the labeled protein with or without a signal 
sequence is incubated with the organelles, and the preparation is 
centrifuged. Only those labeled proteins that contained a signal 
sequence will be transported and therefore will co-fractionate 
with the organelle. (B) the labeled proteins are incubated with 
the organelle, and a protease is added to the preparation. a 
transported protein will be selectively protected from digestion 
by the organelle membrane; adding a detergent that disrupts 
the organelle membrane will eliminate that protection, and the 
transported protein will also be degraded.

another. Some can even track the migration of proteins 
and transport vesicles in real time in living cells. 

in a tube
A protein bearing a signal sequence can be introduced 
to  a  preparation  of  isolated  organelles  in  a  test  tube. 
This mixture can then be tested to see whether the pro-
tein is taken up by the organelle. The protein is usually 
produced  in  vitro  by  cell-free  translation  of  a  purified 
mRNA encoding the polypeptide; in the process, radio-
active amino acids can be used to label the protein so 
that it will be easy to isolate and to follow. The labeled 
protein  is  incubated  with  a  selected  organelle  and  its 
translocation  is  monitored  by  one  of  several  methods 
(Figure 15–27). 

ask a yeast
Movement  of  proteins  between  different  cell  compart-
ments via transport vesicles has been studied extensively 
using genetic techniques. Studies of mutant yeast cells 
that  are  defective  for  secretion  at  high  temperatures 
have  identified  numerous  genes  involved  in  carrying 
proteins from the ER to the cell surface. Many of these 
mutant  genes  encode  temperature-sensitive  proteins 
(discussed  in  Chapter  19).  These  mutant  proteins  may 
function  normally  at  25°C,  but,  when  the  yeast  cells 
are  shifted  to  35°C,  the  proteins  are  inactivated.  As  a 
result, when researchers raise the temperature, the vari-
ous proteins destined for secretion instead accumulate 
inappropriately in the ER, Golgi apparatus, or transport 
vesicles—depending on the particular mutation (Figure 
15–28). 

at the movies
The  most  commonly  used  method  for  tracking  a  pro-
tein as it moves throughout the cell involves tagging the 
polypeptide  with  a  fluorescent  protein,  such  as  green 
fluorescent protein (GFP). Using the genetic engineering 
techniques  discussed  in  Chapter  10,  this  small  protein 
can be fused to other cell proteins. Fortunately, for many 
proteins  studied,  the  addition  of  GFP  to  one  or  other 
end  does  not  perturb  the  protein’s  normal  function  or 
transport.  The  movement  of  a  GFP-tagged  protein  can 
then  be  monitored  in  a  living  cell  with  a  fluorescence 
microscope. In 2008, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was 
awarded to Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien for the devel-
opment and refinement of this technology.

Such GFP fusion proteins are widely used to study the 
location  and  movement  of  proteins  in  cells  (Figure

the nucleus, for example, can be used to study nuclear 
transport events. GFP fused to a plasma membrane pro-
tein can be used to measure the kinetics of its movement 

through  the  secretory  pathway.  Movies  demonstrating

of exocytosis diverge in the trans

are continually secreted from the cell by 
the constitutive secretory pathway, which

this pathway also continually supplies the

diverted into secretory vesicles, where 
the proteins are concentrated and stored 
until an extracellular signal stimulates their 
secretion. It is unclear how these special 
aggregates of secretory proteins (red ) 
are segregated into secretory vesicles. 
Secretory vesicles have unique proteins in 
their membranes; perhaps some of these

secretory vesicles for later release. These vesicles, which are part of the 
endomembrane system, bud off from the trans Golgi network and accu-
mulate near the plasma membrane. There they wait for the extracellular 
signal that will stimulate them to fuse with the plasma membrane and 
release their contents to the cell exterior by exocytosis (Figure 15–30). An 
increase in blood glucose, for example, signals insulin-producing endo-
crine cells in the pancreas to secrete the hormone (Figure 15–31).

ECB4 E15.27/15.27

Proteins destined for regulated secretion are sorted and packaged in the 
trans  Golgi  network.  Proteins  that  travel  by  this  pathway  have  special 
surface properties that cause them to aggregate with one another under 
the  ionic  conditions  (acidic  pH  and  high  Ca2+)  that  prevail  in  the  trans 
Golgi network. The aggregated proteins are packaged into secretory vesi-
cles,  which  pinch  off  from  the  network  and  await  a  signal  instructing 
them to fuse with the plasma membrane. Proteins secreted by the con-
stitutive pathway, on the other hand, do not aggregate and are therefore 
carried automatically to the plasma membrane by the transport vesicles 
of the constitutive pathway. Selective aggregation has another function: 
it  allows  secretory  proteins  to  be  packaged  into  secretory  vesicles  at 
concentrations much higher than the concentration of the unaggregated 
protein  in  the  Golgi  lumen.  This  increase  in  concentration  can  reach

200-fold, enabling secretory cells to release large amounts of the protein 
promptly when triggered to do so (see Figure 15–30).

Question 15–7

When a secretory vesicle or transport vesicle fuses with the plasma mem-
brane and discharges its contents by exocytosis, its membrane becomes 
part of the plasma membrane. Although this should greatly increase the 
surface area of the plasma membrane, it does so only transiently because 
membrane components are removed from other regions of the surface by 
endocytosis almost as fast as they are added by exocytosis. This removal 
returns both the lipids and the proteins of the vesicle membrane to the 
Golgi network, where they can be used again.

What would you expect to happen 
in cells that secrete large amounts 
of protein through the regulated 
secretory pathway if the ionic 
conditions in the er lumen could be 
changed to resemble those in the 
lumen of the trans golgi network?

endocYtic patHWaYs
Eukaryotic  cells  are  continually  taking  up  fluid,  as  well  as  large  and 
small  molecules,  by  the  process  of  endocytosis.  Specialized  cells  are 
also  able  to  internalize  large  particles  and  even  other  cells.  The  ma- 
terial to be ingested is progressively enclosed by a small portion of the 
plasma membrane, which first buds inward and then pinches off to form 
an  intracellular  endocytic  vesicle.  The  ingested  materials,  including  the 
membrane  components,  are  delivered  to  endosomes,  from  which  they 
can be recycled to the plasma membrane or sent to lysosomes for diges-
tion. The metabolites generated by digestion are transferred directly out 
of the lysosome into the cytosol, where they can be used by the cell.

Two  main  types  of  endocytosis  are  distinguished  on  the  basis  of  the 
size  of  the  endocytic  vesicles  formed.  Pinocytosis  (“cellular  drinking”) 
involves the ingestion of fluid and molecules via small pinocytic vesicles  
(<150 nm in diameter). Phagocytosis (“cellular eating”) involves the inges-
tion of large particles, such as microorganisms and cell debris, via large 
vesicles called phagosomes (generally >250 nm in diameter). Whereas all 
eukaryotic cells are continually ingesting fluid and molecules by pinocy-
tosis, large particles are ingested mainly by specialized phagocytic cells.

In  this  final  section,  we  trace  the  endocytic  pathway  from  the  plasma 
membrane to lysosomes. We start by considering the uptake of large par-
ticles by phagocytosis.

specialized phagocytic cells ingest large particles
The most dramatic form of endocytosis, phagocytosis, was first observed 
more than a hundred years ago. In protozoa, phagocytosis is a form of 
feeding: these unicellular eukaryotes ingest large particles such as bac-
teria by taking them up into phagosomes (Movie 15.9). The phagosomes 
then fuse with lysosomes, where the food particles are digested. Few cells 
in multicellular organisms are able to ingest large particles efficiently. In 
the  animal  gut,  for  example,  large  particles  of  food  have  to  be  broken 
down to individual molecules by extracellular enzymes before they can 
be taken up by the absorptive cells lining the gut.

Nevertheless,  phagocytosis  is  important  in  most  animals  for  purposes 
other  than  nutrition.  Phagocytic  cells—including  macrophages,  which 
are  widely  distributed  in  tissues,  and  other  white  blood  cells,  such  as 
neutrophils—defend us against infection by ingesting invading microor-
ganisms. To be taken up by macrophages or neutrophils, particles must 
first bind to the phagocytic cell surface and activate one of a variety of 
surface  receptors.  Some  of  these  receptors  recognize  antibodies,  the 
proteins  that  help  protect  us  against  infection  by  binding  to  the  sur-
face  of  microorganisms.  Binding  of  antibody-coated  bacteria  to  these 
receptors  induces  the  phagocytic  cell  to  extend  sheetlike  projections 
of the plasma membrane, called pseudopods, that engulf the bacterium

(Figure 15–32a) and fuse at their tips to form a phagosome. The phago-
some then fuses with a lysosome, and the microbe is destroyed. Some 
pathogenic  bacteria  have  evolved  tricks  for  subverting  the  system:  for 
example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent responsible for tubercu-
losis, can inhibit the membrane fusion that unites the phagosome with 
a lysosome. Instead of being destroyed, the engulfed organism survives 
and multiplies within the macrophage. Although the mechanism is not 
completely  understood,  identifying  the  proteins  involved  will  provide 
therapeutic targets for drugs that could restore the macrophages’ ability 
to eliminate the infection. 

ECB4 E15.32/15.32

Phagocytic cells also play an important part in scavenging dead and dam-
aged cells and cell debris. Macrophages, for example, ingest more than 
1011 of your worn-out red blood cells each day (Figure 15–32b).

Fluid and macromolecules are taken up by pinocytosis
Eukaryotic cells continually ingest bits of their plasma membrane, along 
with small amounts of extracellular fluid, in the process of pinocytosis. 
The rate at which plasma membrane is internalized in pinocytic vesi-
cles varies from cell type to cell type, but it is usually surprisingly large. 
A  macrophage,  for  example,  swallows  25%  of  its  own  volume  of  fluid 
each hour. This means that it removes 3% of its plasma membrane each 
minute, or 100% in about half an hour. Pinocytosis occurs more slowly 
in fibroblasts, but more rapidly in some phagocytic amoebae. Because a 
cell’s total surface area and volume remain unchanged during this proc-
ess, as much membrane is being added to the cell surface by exocytosis 
as is being removed by endocytosis (see Figure 15–18). It is not known 
how eukaryotic cells maintain this remarkable balance.

Pinocytosis is carried out mainly by the clathrin-coated pits and vesicles 
that we discussed earlier (see Figures 15–19 and 15–20). After they pinch 
off  from  the  plasma  membrane,  clathrin-coated  vesicles  rapidly  shed 
their coat and fuse with an endosome. Extracellular fluid is trapped in the 
coated pit as it invaginates to form a coated vesicle, and so substances 
dissolved in the extracellular fluid are internalized and delivered to endo-
somes. This fluid intake by clathrin-coated and other types of pinocytic 
vesicles is generally balanced by fluid loss during exocytosis.

receptor-mediated endocytosis provides a specific route 
into animal cells
Pinocytosis, as just described, is indiscriminate. The endocytic vesicles 
simply trap any molecules that happen to be present in the extracellular 
fluid and carry them into the cell. In most animal cells, however, pino-
cytosis  via  clathrin-coated  vesicles  also  provides  an  efficient  pathway 
for taking up specific macromolecules from the extracellular fluid. These 
macromolecules bind to complementary receptors on the cell surface and 
enter the cell as receptor–macromolecule complexes in clathrin-coated 
vesicles. This process, called receptor-mediated endocytosis, provides 
a  selective  concentrating  mechanism  that  increases  the  efficiency  of 
internalization of particular macromolecules more than 1000-fold com-
pared with ordinary pinocytosis, so that even minor components of the 
extracellular fluid can be taken up in large amounts without taking in a 
correspondingly large volume of extracellular fluid. An important exam-
ple of receptor-mediated endocytosis is the ability of animal cells to take 
up the cholesterol they need to make new membrane.

Cholesterol  is  a  lipid  that  is  extremely  insoluble  in  water  (see  Figure 
11–7). It is transported in the bloodstream bound to protein in the form of 
particles called low-density lipoproteins, or LDL. Cholesterol-containing 
LDLs, which are secreted by the liver, bind to receptors located on cell 
surfaces causing the receptor–LDL complexes to be ingested by recep-
tor-mediated  endocytosis  and  delivered  to  endosomes.  The  interior  of 
endosomes is more acidic than the surrounding cytosol or the extracel-
lular  fluid,  and  in  this  acidic  environment  the  LDL  dissociates  from  its 
receptor: the receptors are returned in transport vesicles to the plasma 
membrane for reuse, while the LDL is delivered to lysosomes. In the lyso-
somes, the LDL is broken down by hydrolytic enzymes. The cholesterol 
is  released  and  escapes  into  the  cytosol,  where  it  is  available  for  new 
membrane synthesis (Figure 15–33). 

This  pathway  for  cholesterol  uptake  is  disrupted  in  individuals  who 
inherit  a  defective  gene  encoding  the  LDL  receptor  protein.  In  some 
cases, the receptors are missing; in others, they are present but nonfunc-
tional.  In  either  case,  because  the  cells  are  deficient  in  taking  up  LDL, 
cholesterol accumulates in the blood and predisposes the individuals to 
develop atherosclerosis. Unless they take drugs (statins) to reduce their

where it is degraded to release free 
cholesterol (red dots), but the LDL receptors 
are returned to the plasma membrane via 
transport vesicles to be used again (Movie 
15.10). For simplicity, only one LDL receptor 
is shown entering the cell and returning 
to the plasma membrane. Whether it is 
occupied or not, an LDL receptor typically 
makes one round trip into the cell and back

hundred trips in its 20-hour life-span.

Question 15–8

iron (Fe) is an essential trace metal 
that is needed by all cells. it is 
required, for example, for synthesis 
of the heme groups and iron-sulfur 
centers that are part of the active 
site of many proteins involved 
in electron-transfer reactions; it 
is also required in hemoglobin, 
the main protein in red blood 
cells. iron is taken up by cells by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
the iron-uptake system has two 
components: a soluble protein 
called transferrin, which circulates in 
the bloodstream; and a transferrin 
receptor—a transmembrane 
protein that, like the ldl receptor 
in Figure 15–33, is continually 
endocytosed and recycled to the 
plasma membrane. Fe ions bind to 
transferrin at neutral pH but not at 
acidic pH. transferrin binds to the 
transferrin receptor at neutral pH 
only when it has an Fe ion bound, 
but it binds to the receptor at 
acidic pH even in the absence of 
bound iron. From these properties, 
describe how iron is taken up, 
and discuss the advantages of this 
elaborate scheme.

blood  cholesterol,  they  will  likely  die  at  an  early  age  of  heart  attacks, 
which result from cholesterol clogging the coronary arteries that supply 
the heart muscle.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis is also used to take up many other essen-
tial metabolites, such as vitamin B12 and iron, that cells cannot take up 
by the processes of transmembrane transport discussed in Chapter 12. 
Vitamin  B12  and  iron  are  both  required,  for  example,  for  the  synthesis 
of hemoglobin, which is the major protein in red blood cells; they enter 
immature red blood cells as part of a complex with their respective recep-
tor  proteins.  Many  cell-surface  receptors  that  bind  extracellular  signal 
molecules are also ingested by this pathway: some are recycled to the 
plasma membrane for reuse, whereas others are degraded in lysosomes. 
Unfortunately,  receptor-mediated  endocytosis  can  also  be  exploited  by 
viruses: the influenza virus, which causes the flu, gains entry into cells in 
this way.

endocytosed macromolecules are sorted in endosomes
Because  most  extracellular  material  taken  up  by  pinocytosis  is  rapidly 
delivered to endosomes, it is possible to visualize the endosomal com-
partment by incubating living cells in fluid containing an electron-dense 
marker that will show up when viewed in an electron microscope. When 
examined in this way, the endosomal compartment reveals itself to be 
a  complex  set  of  connected  membrane  tubes  and  larger  vesicles.  Two 
sets of endosomes can be distinguished in such loading experiments: the 
marker molecules appear first in early endosomes, just beneath the plasma 
membrane; 5–15 minutes later, they show up in late endosomes, closer to 
the nucleus (see Figure 15–18). Early endosomes mature gradually into 
late endosomes as they fuse with each other or with a preexisting late 
endosome (Movie 15.11). The interior of the endosome compartment is 
kept acidic (pH 5–6) by an ATP-driven H+ (proton) pump in the endosomal 
membrane that pumps H+ into the endosome lumen from the cytosol.
The  endosomal  compartment  acts  as  the  main  sorting  station  in  the 
inward  endocytic  pathway,  just  as  the  trans  Golgi  network  serves  this 
function  in  the  outward  secretory  pathway.  The  acidic  environment  of 
the endosome plays a crucial part in the sorting process by causing many 
(but not all) receptors to release their bound cargo. The routes taken by 
receptors once they have entered an endosome differ according to the 
type of receptor: (1) most are returned to the same plasma membrane 
domain from which they came, as is the case for the LDL receptor dis-
cussed earlier; (2) some travel to lysosomes, where they are degraded; 
and  (3)  some  proceed  to  a  different  domain  of  the  plasma  membrane, 
thereby  transferring  their  bound  cargo  molecules  across  the  cell  from 
one extracellular space to another, a process called transcytosis (Figure 
15–34).

Figure 15–34 The fate of receptor proteins following their 
endocytosis depends on the type of receptor. three pathways 
from the endosomal compartment in an epithelial cell are shown. 
receptors that are not specifically retrieved from early endosomes 
follow the pathway from the endosomal compartment to lysosomes, 
where they are degraded. retrieved receptors are returned either to 
the same plasma membrane domain from which they came (recycling) 
or to a different domain of the plasma membrane (transcytosis). tight 
junctions separate the apical and basolateral plasma membranes 
preventing their resident receptor proteins from diffusing from 
one domain to another. If the ligand that is endocytosed with its 
receptor stays bound to the receptor in the acidic environment of the 
endosome, it will follow the same pathway as the receptor; otherwise it 
will be delivered to lysosomes for degradation.

ECB4 e15.35/15.35

Cargo  proteins  that  remain  bound  to  their  receptors  share  the  fate  of 
their receptors. Cargo that dissociates from receptors in the endosome is 
doomed to destruction in lysosomes, along with most of the contents of 
the endosome lumen. Late endosomes contain some lysosomal enzymes, 
so digestion of cargo proteins and other macromolecules begins in the 
endosome and continues as the endosome gradually matures into a lyso-
some: once it has digested most of its ingested contents, the endosome 
takes on the dense, rounded appearance characteristic of a mature, “clas-
sical” lysosome. 

lysosomes are the principal sites of intracellular digestion
Many  extracellular  particles  and  molecules  ingested  by  cells  end  up  in 
lysosomes,  which  are  membranous  sacs  of  hydrolytic  enzymes  that 
carry  out  the  controlled  intracellular  digestion  of  both  extracellular  
materials  and  worn-out  organelles.  They  contain  about  40  types  of 
hydrolytic enzymes, including those that degrade proteins, nucleic acids, 
oligosaccharides, and lipids. All of these enzymes are optimally active in 
the  acidic  conditions  (pH  ~5)  maintained  within  lysosomes.  The  mem-
brane of the lysosome normally keeps these destructive enzymes out of 
the cytosol (whose pH is about 7.2), but the enzymes’ acid dependence 
protects the contents of the cytosol against damage even if some of them 
should escape.

Like all other intracellular organelles, the lysosome not only contains a 
unique collection of enzymes but also has a unique surrounding mem-
brane.  The  lysosomal  membrane  contains  transporters  that  allow  the 
final products of the digestion of macromolecules, such as amino acids, 
sugars, and nucleotides, to be transferred to the cytosol; from there, they 
can be either excreted or utilized by the cell. The membrane also con-
tains an ATP-driven H+ pump, which, like the ATPase in the endosome 
membrane,  pumps  H+  into  the  lysosome,  thereby  maintaining  its  con-
tents at an acidic pH (Figure 15–35). Most of the lysosomal membrane 
proteins are unusually highly glycosylated; the sugars, which cover much 
of the protein surfaces facing the lumen, protect the proteins from diges-
tion by the lysosomal proteases.

The  specialized  digestive  enzymes  and  membrane  proteins  of  the  lys-
osome  are  synthesized  in  the  ER  and  transported  through  the  Golgi 
apparatus to the trans Golgi network. While in the ER and the cis Golgi 
network, the enzymes are tagged with a specific phosphorylated sugar 
group (mannose 6-phosphate), so that when they arrive in the trans Golgi 
network they can be recognized by an appropriate receptor, the mannose 
6-phosphate receptor. This tagging permits the lysosomal enzymes to be 
sorted and packaged into transport vesicles, which bud off and deliver 
their contents to lysosomes via endosomes (see Figure 15–18).

Depending on their source, materials follow different paths to lysosomes. 
We have seen that extracellular particles are taken up into phagosomes, 
which fuse with lysosomes, and that extracellular fluid and macromol-
ecules are taken up into smaller endocytic vesicles, which deliver their 
contents to lysosomes via endosomes. 

Cells have an additional pathway that supplies materials to lysosomes; 
this pathway, called autophagy, is used to degrade obsolete parts of the 
cell—the cell literally eats itself. In electron micrographs of liver cells, for 
example,  one  often  sees  lysosomes  digesting  mitochondria,  as  well  as 
other organelles. The process begins with the enclosure of the organelle 
by  a  double  membrane,  creating  an  autophagosome,  which  then  fuses 
with  a  lysosome  (Figure  15–36).  It  is  still  debated  where  these  mem-
brane fragments originate, or how specific cell components are marked

essential concepts
•	 Eukaryotic	 cells	 contain	 many	 membrane-enclosed	 organelles,	
including	 a	 nucleus,	 an	 endoplasmic	 reticulum	 (ER),	 a	 Golgi	 appa-
ratus,	 lysosomes,	 endosomes,	 mitochondria,	 chloroplasts	 (in	 plant	
cells),	 and	 peroxisomes.	 The	 ER,	 Golgi	 apparatus,	 peroxisomes,	
endosomes,	and	lysosomes	are	all	part	of	the	endomembrane system. 
•	 Most	organelle	proteins	are	made	in	the	cytosol	and	transported	into	
the organelle where they function. Sorting signals in the amino acid 
sequence guide the proteins to the correct organelle; proteins that 
function in the cytosol have no such signals and remain where they 
are made.

•	 Nuclear	proteins	contain	nuclear	localization	signals	that	help	direct	
their  active  transport  from  the  cytosol  into  the  nucleus  through 
nuclear	pores,	which	penetrate	the	double-membrane	nuclear	enve-
lope.	The	proteins	are	transported	in	their	fully	folded	conformation.

•	 Most	mitochondrial	and	chloroplast	proteins	are	made	in	the	cytosol	
and are then transported into the organelles by protein translocators

process. 

•	 The	ER	makes	most	of	the	cell’s	lipids	and	many	of	its	proteins.	The	
proteins  are  made  by  ribosomes  that  are  directed  to  the  ER  by  a

ribosome to a protein translocator that threads the growing polypep-
tide across the ER membrane through a translocation channel.

•	 Water-soluble	proteins	destined	for	secretion	or	for	the	lumen	of	an	
organelle  of  the  endomembrane  system  pass  completely  into  the

anchored  in  the  lipid  bilayer  by  one  or  more  membrane-spanning  
α helices.

•	 Exit	from	the	ER	is	an	important	quality-control	step;	proteins	that	
either fail to fold properly or fail to assemble with their normal part-

their aggregation and help them fold; proteins that still fail to fold or 
assemble	are	transported	to	the	cytosol,	where	they	are	degraded.

•	 Excessive	 accumulation	 of	 misfolded	 proteins	 triggers	 an	 unfolded

•	 Protein	transport	from	the	ER	to	the	Golgi	apparatus	and	from	the	
Golgi apparatus to other destinations is mediated by transport vesi-

another,	a	process	called	vesicular	transport.

•	 Budding	 transport	 vesicles	 have	 distinctive	 coat	 proteins	 on	 their	
cytosolic surface; the assembly of the coat helps drive both the bud-

•	 Coated	vesicles	rapidly	lose	their	protein	coat,	enabling	them	to	dock

are  mediated  by  proteins  on  the  surface  of  the  vesicle  and  target 
membrane,	including	Rab	and	SNARE	proteins.

•	 The	 Golgi	 apparatus	 receives	 newly	 made	 proteins	 from	 the	 ER;	 it	
modifies	 their	 oligosaccharides,	 sorts	 the	 proteins,	 and	 dispatches	
them from the trans Golgi	network	to	the	plasma	membrane,	lyso-

In	 all	 eukaryotic	 cells,	 transport	 vesicles	 continually	 bud	 from	 the

ess  of  constitutive  exocytosis  delivers  proteins  to  the  cell  surface 
for  secretion  and  incorporates  lipids  and  proteins  into  the  plasma 
membrane.

•	 Specialized	secretory	cells	also	have	a	regulated	exocytosis	pathway,	
in  which  molecules  concentrated  and  stored  in  secretory  vesicles

Questions

Question 15–9
Which of the following statements are correct? explain your 
answers.
a.  ribosomes are cytoplasmic structures that, during 
protein synthesis, become linked by an mrna molecule to 
form polyribosomes.
b.  the amino acid sequence leu-His-arg-leu-asp-ala-gln-
ser-lys-leu-ser-ser is a signal sequence that directs proteins 
to the er.
c.  all transport vesicles in the cell must have a v-snare 
protein in their membrane.
d.  transport vesicles deliver proteins and lipids to the cell 
surface.
e.  if the delivery of prospective lysosomal proteins from the 
trans golgi network to the late endosomes were blocked, 
lysosomal proteins would be secreted by the constitutive 
secretion pathways shown in Figure 15–30. 
F.  lysosomes digest only substances that have been taken 
up by cells by endocytosis.
g.  N-linked sugar chains are found on glycoproteins that 
face the cell surface, as well as on glycoproteins that face 
the lumen of the er, trans golgi network, and mitochondria.

Question 15–10
some proteins shuttle back and forth between the nucleus 
and the cytosol. they need a nuclear export signal to get 
out of the nucleus. How do you suppose they get into the 
nucleus?

Question 15–11
influenza viruses are surrounded by a membrane that 
contains a fusion protein, which is activated by acidic pH. 
upon activation, the protein causes the viral membrane to 

fuse with cell membranes. an old folk remedy against flu 
recommends that one should spend a night in a horse’s 
stable. odd as it may sound, there is a rational explanation 
for this advice. air in stables contains ammonia (nH3) 
generated by bacteria in the horse’s urine. sketch a diagram 
showing the pathway (in detail) by which flu virus enters 
cells, and speculate how nH3 may protect cells from virus 
infection. (Hint: nH3 can neutralize acidic solutions by the 
reaction nH3 + H+ → nH4

+.) 

Question 15–12
consider the v-snares that direct transport vesicles 
from the trans golgi network to the plasma membrane. 
they, like all other v-snares, are membrane proteins that 
are integrated into the membrane of the er during their 
biosynthesis and are then carried by transport vesicles to 
their destination. thus, transport vesicles budding from 
the er contain at least two kinds of v-snares—those that 
target the vesicles to the cis golgi cisternae, and those that 
are in transit to the trans golgi network to be packaged 
in different transport vesicles destined for the plasma 
membrane. (a) Why might this be a problem? (b) suggest 
possible ways in which the cell might solve it.

Question 15–13
a particular type of Drosophila mutant becomes paralyzed 
when the temperature is raised. the mutation affects the 
structure of dynamin, causing it to be inactivated at the 
higher temperature. indeed, the function of dynamin was 
discovered by analyzing the defect in these mutant fruit 
flies. the complete paralysis at the elevated temperature 
suggests that synaptic transmission between nerve and 
muscle cells (discussed in chapter 12) is blocked. suggest 
why signal transmission at a synapse might require dynamin. 
on the basis of your hypothesis, what would you expect to 
see in electron micrographs of synapses of flies that were 
exposed to the elevated temperature?

Question 15–20
taking the evolutionary scheme in Figure 15–3 one step 
further, suggest how the golgi apparatus could have 
evolved. sketch a simple diagram to illustrate your ideas. 
For the golgi apparatus to be functional, what else would 
be needed?

Question 15–21
if membrane proteins are integrated into the er membrane 
by means of the er protein translocator (which is itself 
composed of membrane proteins), how do the first protein 
translocation channels become incorporated into the er 
membrane?

Question 15–23
What would happen to proteins bound for the nucleus if 
there were insufficient energy to transport them?

ECB4 EQ14.22/Q15.22

Question 15–14
edit each of the following statements, if required, to make 
them true: “because nuclear localization sequences are not 
cleaved off by proteases following protein import into the 
nucleus, they can be reused to import nuclear proteins after 
mitosis, when cytosolic and nuclear proteins have become 
intermixed. this is in contrast to er signal sequences, which 
are cleaved off by a signal peptidase once they reach the 
lumen of the er. er signal sequences cannot therefore be 
reused to import er proteins after mitosis, when cytosolic 
and er proteins have become intermixed; these er proteins 
must therefore be degraded and resynthesized.”

Question 15–15
consider a protein that contains an er signal sequence at its 
n-terminus and a nuclear localization sequence in its middle. 
What do you think the fate of this protein would be? explain 
your answer.

Question 15–16
compare and contrast protein import into the er and 
into the nucleus. list at least two major differences in the 
mechanisms, and speculate why the er mechanism might 
not work for nuclear import and vice versa.

Question 15–17
during mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down and 
intranuclear proteins completely intermix with cytosolic 
proteins. is this consistent with the evolutionary scheme 
proposed in Figure 15–3?

Question 15–18
a protein that inhibits certain proteolytic enzymes 
(proteases) is normally secreted into the bloodstream 
by liver cells. this inhibitor protein, antitrypsin, is absent 
from the bloodstream of patients who carry a mutation 
that results in a single amino acid change in the protein. 
antitrypsin deficiency causes a variety of severe problems, 
particularly in lung tissue, because of the uncontrolled 
activity of proteases. surprisingly, when the mutant 
antitrypsin is synthesized in the laboratory, it is as active 
as the normal antitrypsin at inhibiting proteases. Why, 
then, does the mutation cause the disease? think of more 
than one possibility, and suggest ways in which you could 
distinguish between them.

Question 15–19
dr. outonalimb’s claim to fame is her discovery of 
forgettin, a protein predominantly made by the pineal 
gland in human teenagers. the protein causes selective 
short-term unresponsiveness and memory loss when the 
auditory system receives statements like “please take 
out the garbage!” Her hypothesis is that forgettin has a 
hydrophobic er signal sequence at its c-terminus that is 
recognized by an srp and causes it to be translocated 
across the er membrane by the mechanism shown in 
Figure 15–14. she predicts that the protein is secreted 
from pineal cells into the bloodstream, from where it exerts 
its devastating systemic effects. You are a member of the 
committee deciding whether she should receive a grant 
for further work on her hypothesis. critique her proposal, 
and remember that grant reviews should be polite and 
constructive.

chapter SIXTEEN

Cell Signaling

Individual cells, like multicellular organisms, need to sense and respond 
to their environment. A free-living cell—even a humble bacterium—must 
be  able  to  track  down  nutrients,  tell  the  difference  between  light  and 
dark, and avoid poisons and predators. And if such a cell is to have any 
kind  of  “social  life,”  it  must  be  able  to  communicate  with  other  cells. 
When a yeast cell is ready to mate, for example, it secretes a small pro-
tein called a mating factor. Yeast cells of the opposite “sex” detect this 
chemical mating call and respond by halting their progress through the 
cell-division cycle and reaching out toward the cell that emitted the sig-
nal (Figure 16–1). 

In  a  multicellular  organism,  things  are  much  more  complicated.  Cells 
must interpret the multitude of signals they receive from other cells to 
help coordinate their behaviors. During animal development, for exam-
ple, cells in the embryo exchange signals to determine which specialized 
role each cell will adopt, what position it will occupy in the animal, and 
whether it will survive, divide, or die. Later in life, a large variety of sig-
nals coordinates the animal’s growth and its day-to-day physiology and 
behavior. In plants as well, cells are in constant communication with one 
another. These cell–cell interactions allow the plant to coordinate what 
happens in its roots, stems, and leaves.

In this chapter, we examine some of the most important mechanisms by 
which cells send signals and interpret the signals they receive. First, we 
present an overview of the general principles of cell signaling. We then 
consider two of the main systems animal cells use to receive and inter-
pret signals, followed by a brief discussion of cell signaling mechanisms 
in plants. Finally, we consider how extensive and intricate signaling net-
works interact to control complex behaviors.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CELL SIGNALING
Information  can  come  in  a  variety  of  forms,  and  communication  fre-
quently involves converting the signals that carry that information from 
one  form  to  another.  When  you  receive  a  call  from  a  friend  on  your 
mobile phone, for instance, the phone converts the radio signals, which 
travel through the air, into sound waves, which you hear. This process of 
conversion is called signal transduction (Figure 16–2).

ECB4 16.01/16.01

The signals that pass between cells are simpler than the sorts of mes-
sages  that  humans  ordinarily  exchange.  In  a  typical  communication 
between cells, the signaling cell produces a particular type of extracellular 
signal molecule that is detected by the target cell. As in human conver-
sation,  most  animal  cells  both  send  and  receive  signals,  and  they  can 
therefore act as both signaling cells and target cells. 

Target cells possess proteins called receptors that recognize and respond 
specifically to the signal molecule. Signal transduction begins when the 
receptor  on  a  target  cell  receives  an  incoming  extracellular  signal  and 
converts it to the intracellular signaling molecules that alter cell behavior. 
Most  of  this  chapter  is  concerned  with  signal  reception  and  transduc-
tion—the events that cell biologists have in mind when they refer to cell 
signaling. First, however, we look briefly at the different types of extra-
cellular signals that cells send to one another.

Signals Can Act over a Long or Short Range
Cells in multicellular organisms use hundreds of kinds of extracellular sig-
nal molecules to communicate with one another. The signal molecules 
can be proteins, peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, steroids, fatty acid 
derivatives, or even dissolved gases—but they all rely on only a handful 
of basic styles of communication for getting the message across.

In multicellular organisms, the most “public” style of cell-to-cell commu-
nication involves broadcasting the signal throughout the whole body by 
secreting it into an animal’s bloodstream or a plant’s sap. Extracellular 
signal molecules used in this way are called hormones, and, in animals, 
the cells that produce hormones are called endocrine cells (Figure 16–3a). 
Part of the pancreas, for example, is an endocrine gland that produces 
several hormones—including insulin, which regulates glucose uptake in 
cells all over the body.

Figure 16–2 Signal transduction is the 
process whereby one type of signal is 
converted to another. (a) When a mobile 
telephone receives a radio signal, it converts 
it into a sound signal; when transmitting a 
signal, it does the reverse. (B) a target cell 
converts an extracellular signal molecule 
(molecule a) into an intracellular signaling 
molecule (molecule B).

Somewhat less public is the process known as paracrine signaling. In this 
case, rather than entering the bloodstream, the signal molecules diffuse 
locally through the extracellular fluid, remaining in the neighborhood of 
the cell that secretes them. Thus, they act as local mediators on nearby 
cells (Figure 16–3B). Many of the signal molecules that regulate inflam-
mation  at  the  site  of  an  infection  or  that  control  cell  proliferation  in  a 
healing wound function in this way. In some cases, cells can respond to 
the  local  mediators  that  they  themselves  produce,  a  form  of  paracrine 
communication  called  autocrine  signaling;  cancer  cells  sometimes  pro-
mote their own survival and proliferation in this way.  

Neuronal signaling is a third form of cell communication. Like endocrine 
cells,  nerve  cells  (neurons)  can  deliver  messages  over  long  distances. 
In the case of neuronal signaling, however, a message is not broadcast 
widely but is instead delivered quickly and specifically to individual tar-
get cells through private lines. As described in Chapter 12, the axon of 
a  neuron  terminates  at  specialized  junctions  (synapses)  on  target  cells 
that can lie far from the neuronal cell body (Figure 16–3C). The axons 
that  extend  from  the  spinal  cord  to  the  big  toe  in  an  adult  human,  for 
example, can be more than a meter in length. When activated by signals 
from the environment or from other nerve cells, a neuron sends electrical 
impulses racing along its axon at speeds of up to 100 m/sec. On reaching 
the  axon  terminal,  these  electrical  signals  are  converted  into  a  chemi-
cal form: each electrical impulse stimulates the nerve terminal to release 
a  pulse  of  an  extracellular  signal  molecule  called  a  neurotransmitter. 
The neurotransmitter then diffuses across the narrow (<100 nm) gap that 
separates the membrane of the axon terminal from that of the target cell, 
reaching its destination in less than 1 msec.

A fourth style of signal-mediated cell-to-cell communication—the most 
intimate and short-range of all—does not require the release of a secreted 
molecule. Instead, the cells make direct physical contact through signal

Figure 16–3 animal cells use 
extracellular signal molecules to 
communicate with one another 
in various ways. (a) hormones 
produced in endocrine glands are 
secreted into the bloodstream and 
are distributed widely throughout the 
body. (B) paracrine signals are released 
by cells into the extracellular fluid in 
their neighborhood and act locally. 
(c) Neuronal signals are transmitted 
electrically along a nerve cell axon. 
When this electrical signal reaches the 
nerve terminal, it causes the release 
of neurotransmitters onto adjacent 
target cells. (D) In contact-dependent 
signaling, a cell-surface-bound signal 
molecule binds to a receptor protein 
on an adjacent cell. Many of the same 
types of signal molecules are used for 
endocrine, paracrine, and neuronal 
signaling. the crucial differences lie in 
the speed and selectivity with which the 
signals are delivered to their targets.

ChapTEr 16     cell Signaling

Figure 16–4 Contact-dependent signaling 
controls nerve-cell production in the fruit 
fly Drosophila. the fly nervous system 
originates in the embryo from a sheet of 
epithelial cells. Isolated cells in this sheet 
begin to specialize as neurons, while 
their neighbors remain non-neuronal and 
maintain the structure of the epithelial 
sheet. the signals that control this process 
are transmitted via direct cell–cell contacts: 
each future neuron delivers an inhibitory 
signal to the cells next to it, deterring 
them from specializing as neurons too—a 
process called lateral inhibition. Both the 
signal molecule (in this case, Delta) and 
the receptor molecule (called Notch) are 
transmembrane proteins.

molecules  lodged  in  the  plasma  membrane  of  the  signaling  cell  and 
receptor proteins embedded in the plasma membrane of the target cell 
(Figure 16–3D). During embryonic development, for example, such con-
tact-dependent signaling allows adjacent cells that are initially similar to 
become specialized to form different cell types (Figure 16–4).

ECB4 e16.04/16.04

To contrast these different signaling styles, imagine trying to advertise a 
potentially stimulating lecture—or a concert or football game. An endo-
crine signal would be akin to broadcasting the information over a radio 
station. A localized paracrine signal would be the equivalent of posting 
a  flyer  on  selected  notice  boards  in  your  neighborhood.  Neuronal  sig-
nals—long-distance  but  personal—would  be  similar  to  a  phone  call,  a 
text message, or an e-mail, and contact-dependent signaling would be 
like a good old-fashioned, face-to-face conversation. In autocrine signal-
ing, you might write a note to remind yourself to attend.
Table  16–1  lists  some  examples  of  hormones,  local  mediators,  neuro-
transmitters,  and  contact-dependent  signal  molecules.  The  action  of 
several of these is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.

Each Cell Responds to a Limited Set of Extracellular 
Signals, depending on Its History and Its Current State 
A typical cell in a multicellular organism is exposed to hundreds of dif-
ferent  signal  molecules  in  its  environment.  These  may  be  free  in  the 
extracellular fluid, embedded in the extracellular matrix in which most 
cells reside, or bound to the surface of neighboring cells. Each cell must 
respond very selectively to this mixture of signals, disregarding some and 
reacting to others, according to the cell’s specialized function.

Whether  a  cell  responds  to  a  signal  molecule  depends  first  of  all  on 
whether it possesses a receptor for that signal. Each receptor is usually 
activated by only one type of signal. Without the appropriate receptor, a 
cell will be deaf to the signal and will not respond to it. By producing only 
a limited set of receptors out of the thousands that are possible, a cell 
restricts the types of signals that can affect it. 

Of course, even this restricted set of extracellular signal molecules could 
change  the  behavior  of  a  target  cell  in  a  large  variety  of  ways.  They 
could alter the cell’s shape, movement, metabolism, or gene expression, 
or  some  combination  of  these.  As  we  will  see,  the  signal  from  a  cell-
surface receptor is generally conveyed into the target cell interior via a 
set of intracellular signaling molecules. These molecules act in sequence 
and ultimately alter the activity of effector proteins, those that have some 
direct  effect  on  the  behavior  of  the  target  cell.  This  intracellular  relay

respond to the same signal in different ways. For example, when a heart 
pacemaker cell is exposed to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, its rate 
of  firing  decreases.  When  a  salivary  gland  is  exposed  to  the  same  sig-
nal, it secretes components of saliva, even though the receptors are the 
same on both cell types. In skeletal muscle, acetylcholine binds to a dif-
ferent receptor protein, causing the cell to contract (Figure 16–5). Thus, 
the extracellular signal molecule alone is not the message: the informa-
tion conveyed by the signal depends on how the target cell receives and 
interprets the signal.

Figure 16–5 The same signal molecule 
can induce different responses in 
different target cells. Different cell 
types are configured to respond to the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine in different 
ways. acetylcholine binds to similar receptor 
proteins on heart pacemaker cells (a) 
and salivary gland cells (B), but it evokes 
different responses in each cell type. 
Skeletal muscle cells (c) produce a different 
type of receptor protein for the same 
signal. (D) For such a versatile molecule, 
acetylcholine has a fairly simple chemical 
structure.

A  typical  cell  possesses  many  sorts  of  receptors—each  present  in  tens 
to hundreds of thousands of copies. Such variety makes the cell simul-
taneously  sensitive  to  many  different  extracellular  signals  and  allows 
a  relatively  small  number  of  signal  molecules,  used  in  different  com-
binations,  to  exert  subtle  and  complex  control  over  cell  behavior.  A 
combination of signals can evoke a response that is different from the 
sum of the effects that each signal would trigger on its own. As we dis-
cuss later, this “tailoring” of a cell’s response occurs, in part, because the 
intracellular relay systems activated by the different signals interact. Thus 
the presence of one signal will often modify the effects of another. One 
combination of signals might enable a cell to survive; another might drive 
it to differentiate in some specialized way; and another might cause it to 
divide. In the absence of any signals, most animal cells are programmed 
to kill themselves (Figure 16–6).

Figure 16–6 an animal cell depends on

type displays a set of receptor proteins that 
enables it to respond to a specific set of 
extracellular signal molecules produced by 
other cells. these signal molecules work in 
combinations to regulate the behavior of 
the cell. as shown here, cells may require 
multiple signals (blue arrows) to survive, 
additional signals (red arrows) to grow and 
divide, and still other signals (green arrows) 
to differentiate. If deprived of survival 
signals, most cells undergo a form of cell 
suicide known as apoptosis (discussed in 
chapter 18).

A Cell’s Response to a Signal Can Be Fast or Slow
The length of time a cell takes to respond to an extracellular signal can 
vary greatly, depending on what needs to happen once the message has 
been received. Some extracellular signals act swiftly: acetylcholine can 
stimulate a skeletal muscle cell to contract within milliseconds and a sali-
vary gland cell to secrete within a minute or so. Such rapid responses are 
possible because, in each case, the signal affects the activity of proteins 
that  are  already  present  inside  the  target  cell,  awaiting  their  marching 
orders.

ECB4 e16.07/16.07

Other  responses  take  more  time.  Cell  growth  and  cell  division,  when 
triggered  by  the  appropriate  signal  molecules,  can  take  many  hours 
to  execute.  This  is  because  the  response  to  these  extracellular  signals 
requires changes in gene expression and the production of new proteins 
(Figure  16–7).  We  will  encounter  additional  examples  of  both  fast  and 
slow responses—and the signal molecules that stimulate them—later in 
the chapter.

Some Hormones Cross the Plasma membrane and Bind to 
Intracellular Receptors
Extracellular  signal  molecules  generally  fall  into  two  classes.  The 
first  and  largest  class  consists  of  molecules  that  are  too  large  or  too 
hydrophilic to cross the plasma membrane of the target cell. They rely on 
receptors on the surface of the target cell to relay their message across 
the membrane (Figure 16–8a). The second, and smaller, class of signals 

Figure 16–8 Extracellular signal molecules bind either to cell-
surface receptors or to intracellular enzymes or receptors. 
(a) Most extracellular signal molecules are large and hydrophilic and 
are therefore unable to cross the plasma membrane directly; instead, 
they bind to cell-surface receptors, which in turn generate one or more 
intracellular signaling molecules in the target cell. (B) Some small, 
hydrophobic, extracellular signal molecules, by contrast, pass through 
the target cell’s plasma membrane and either activate intracellular 
enzymes directly or bind to intracellular receptors—in the cytosol or in 
the nucleus (as shown here)—that then regulate gene transcription or 
other functions. 

General principles of cell Signaling

Figure 16–7 Extracellular signals can act 
slowly or rapidly. certain types of cell 
responses—such as cell differentiation or 
increased cell growth and division (see 
Figure 16–6)—involve changes in gene 
expression and the synthesis of new 
proteins; they therefore occur relatively 
slowly. Other responses—such as changes in 
cell movement, secretion, or metabolism—
need not involve changes in gene 
expression and therefore occur more quickly 
(see Figure 16–5).

consists of molecules that are small enough or hydrophobic enough to 
pass through the plasma membrane and into the cytosol. Once inside, 
these  signal  molecules  usually  activate  intracellular  enzymes  or  bind 
to  intracellular  receptor  proteins  that  regulate  gene  expression  (Figure 
16–8B). 

One  important  category  of  signal  molecules  that  rely  on  intracellular 
receptor proteins is the family of steroid hormones—including cortisol, 
estradiol,  and  testosterone—and  the  thyroid  hormones  such  as  thyrox-
ine (Figure 16–9). All of these hydrophobic molecules pass through the 
plasma membrane of the target cell and bind to receptor proteins located 
in either the cytosol or the nucleus. Both the cytosolic and nuclear recep-
tors  are  referred  to  as  nuclear  receptors,  because,  when  activated  by 
hormone binding, they act as transcription regulators in the nucleus (dis-
cussed in Chapter 8). In unstimulated cells, nuclear receptors are typically 
present in an inactive form. When a hormone binds, the receptor under-
goes a large conformational change that activates the protein, allowing 
it to promote or inhibit the transcription of specific target genes (Figure 
16–10).  Each  hormone  binds  to  a  different  nuclear  receptor,  and  each 
receptor acts at a different set of regulatory sites in DNA (discussed in 
Chapter 8). Moreover, a given hormone usually regulates different sets 
of  genes  in  different  cell  types,  thereby  evoking  different  physiological 
responses in different target cells. 

Nuclear  receptors  and  the  hormones  that  activate  them  have  essential 
roles in human physiology (see Table 16–1, p. 529). Loss of these sign-
aling  systems  can  have  dramatic  consequences,  as  illustrated  by  what 
happens in individuals who lack the receptor for the male sex hormone 
testosterone. Testosterone in humans shapes the formation of the exter-
nal genitalia and influences brain development in the fetus; at puberty, the 
hormone triggers the development of male secondary sexual character-
istics. Some very rare individuals are genetically male—that is, they have 
both an X and a Y chromosome—but lack the testosterone receptor as 
a result of a mutation in the corresponding gene; thus, they make testo-
sterone, but their cells cannot respond to it. As a result, these individuals 
develop  as  females,  which  is  the  path  that  sexual  and  brain  develop-
ment would take if no male or female hormones were produced. Such a 
sex reversal demonstrates the crucial role of the testosterone receptor in 
sexual development, and it also shows that the receptor is required not 
just in one cell type to mediate one effect of testosterone, but in many cell 
types to help produce the whole range of features that distinguish men 
from women.

Figure 16–10 The steroid hormone 
cortisol acts by activating a transcription 
regulator. cortisol is one of the hormones 
produced by the adrenal glands in response 
to stress. It crosses the plasma membrane 
and binds to its receptor protein, which 
is located in the cytosol. the receptor–
hormone complex is then transported into 
the nucleus via the nuclear pores. cortisol 
binding activates the receptor protein, 
which is then able to bind to specific 
regulatory sequences in DNa and activate 
(or repress, not shown) the transcription 
of specific target genes. Whereas the 
receptors for cortisol and some other 
steroid hormones are located in the cytosol, 
those for other steroid hormones and for 
thyroid hormones are already bound to 
DNa in the nucleus even in the absence of 
hormone. 

Some dissolved Gases Cross the Plasma membrane and 
Activate Intracellular Enzymes directly
ECB4 e16.10/16.10
Steroid  hormones  and  thyroid  hormones  are  not  the  only  extracellular 
signal molecules that can pass through the plasma membrane. Some dis-
solved  gases  can  diffuse  across  the  membrane  to  the  cell  interior  and 
directly regulate the activity of specific intracellular proteins. This direct 
approach allows such signals to alter a target cell within a few seconds 
or minutes. The gas nitric oxide (NO) acts in this way. NO is synthesized 
from the amino acid arginine and diffuses readily from its site of synthe-
sis into neighboring cells. The gas acts only locally because it is quickly 
converted to nitrates and nitrites (with a half-life of about 5–10 seconds) 
by reacting with oxygen and water outside cells. 

Endothelial cells—the flattened cells that line every blood vessel—release 
NO in response to neurotransmitters secreted by nearby nerve endings. 
This NO signal causes smooth muscle cells in the adjacent vessel wall to 
relax, allowing the vessel to dilate, so that blood flows through it more 
freely  (Figure  16–11).  The  effect  of  NO  on  blood  vessels  accounts  for 
the action of nitroglycerine, which has been used for almost 100 years 
to treat patients with angina—pain caused by inadequate blood flow to 
the heart muscle. In the body, nitroglycerine is converted to NO, which 
rapidly relaxes blood vessels, thereby reducing the workload on the heart 
and  decreasing  the  muscle’s  need  for  oxygen-rich  blood.  Many  nerve 
cells also use NO to signal neighboring cells: NO released by nerve ter-
minals in the penis, for instance, acts as a local mediator to trigger the 
blood-vessel dilation responsible for penile erection.

Inside many target cells, NO binds to and activates the enzyme guanylyl 
cyclase, stimulating the formation of cyclic GMP from the nucleotide GTP 
(see  Figure  16–11B).  Cyclic  GMP  is  itself  a  small  intracellular  signaling 
molecule that forms the next link in the NO signaling chain that leads to 
the cell’s ultimate response. The impotence drug Viagra enhances penile 
erection  by  blocking  the  enzyme  that  degrades  cyclic  GMP,  prolonging 
the NO signal. Cyclic GMP is very similar in its structure and mechanism

the cells to make and release NO. the NO then diffuses out of the 
endothelial cells and into adjacent smooth muscle cells, where it 
regulates the activity of specific proteins, causing the muscle cells to 
relax. One key target protein that can be activated by NO in smooth 
muscle cells is guanylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the production of 
cyclic GMp from Gtp. Note that NO gas is highly toxic when inhaled 
and should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O), also known as 
laughing gas.

Cell-Surface Receptors Relay Extracellular Signals via 
Intracellular Signaling Pathways
In contrast to NO and the steroid and thyroid hormones, the vast majority 
of signal molecules are too large or hydrophilic to cross the plasma mem-
brane of the target cell. These proteins, peptides, and small hydrophilic 
molecules  bind  to  cell-surface  receptor  proteins  that  span  the  plasma 
membrane (see Figure 16–8A). Transmembrane receptors detect a signal 
on the outside and relay the message, in a new form, across the mem-
brane into the interior of the cell.

ECB4 e16.11-16.11

The receptor protein performs the primary step in signal transduction: it 
recognizes the extracellular signal and generates new intracellular sig-
nals in response (see Figure 16–2B). The resulting intracellular signaling 
process usually works like a molecular relay race, in which the message 
is passed “downstream” from one intracellular  signaling  molecule to 
another, each activating or generating the next signaling molecule in the 
pathway, until a metabolic enzyme is kicked into action, the cytoskeleton 
is tweaked into a new configuration, or a gene is switched on or off. This 
final outcome is called the response of the cell (Figure 16–12).

QuEStION 16–3

In principle, how might an 
intracellular signaling protein amplify 
a signal as it relays it onward?

The components of these intracellular signaling pathways perform one 
or more crucial functions (Figure 16–13):

1.  They can simply relay the signal onward and thereby help spread it 

through the cell. 

2.  They  can  amplify  the  signal  received,  making  it  stronger,  so  that 
a  few  extracellular  signal  molecules  are  enough  to  evoke  a  large 
intracellular response.

3.  They can detect signals from more than one intracellular signaling 

pathway and integrate them before relaying a signal onward.

signaling molecules, which can be proteins 
or small messenger molecules; only one 
pathway is shown. Signaling molecules

complex response.

ECB6 e16.12/16.12

The  steps  in  a  signaling  pathway  are  generally  subject  to  modula-
tion by feedback regulation. In positive feedback, a component that lies 
downstream in the pathway acts on an earlier component in the same 
pathway to enhance the response to the initial signal; in negative feed-
back, a downstream component acts to inhibit an earlier component in 
the pathway to diminish the response to the initial signal (Figure 16–14). 
Such feedback regulation is very common in biological systems and can 
lead to complex responses: positive feedback can generate all-or-none, 
switchlike responses, for example, whereas negative feedback can gen-
erate responses that oscillate on and off.

Some Intracellular Signaling Proteins Act as molecular 
Switches
Many  of  the  key  intracellular  signaling  proteins  behave  as  molecular 
switches: receipt of a signal causes them to toggle from an inactive to 
an active state. Once activated, these proteins can stimulate—or in other 
cases suppress—other proteins in the signaling pathway. They then per-
sist in an active state until some other process switches them off again. 

The importance of the switching-off process is often underappreciated: 
imagine the consequences if a signaling pathway that boosts your heart 
rate were to remain active indefinitely. If a signaling pathway is to recover 
after transmitting a signal and make itself ready to transmit another, every 
activated protein in the pathway must be reset to its original, unstimu-
lated state. Thus, for every activation step along the pathway, there has 
to  be  an  inactivation  mechanism.  The  two  are  equally  important  for  a 
signaling pathway to be useful.

536 

ChapTEr 16     cell Signaling

Figure 16–13 Intracellular signaling 
proteins can relay, amplify, integrate, 
and distribute the incoming signal. In this 
example, a receptor protein located on 
the cell surface transduces an extracellular 
signal into an intracellular signal, which 
initiates one or more intracellular signaling 
pathways that relay the signal into the cell 
interior. each pathway includes intracellular 
signaling proteins that can function in 
one of the various ways shown; some, 
for example, integrate signals from other 
intracellular signaling pathways. Many of 
the steps in the process can be modulated 
by other molecules or events in the cell 
(not shown). Note that some proteins in 
the pathway may be held in close proximity 
by a scaffold protein, which allows them 
to be activated at a specific location in the 
cell and with greater speed, efficiency, and 
selectivity. We discuss the production and 
function of small intracellular messenger 
molecules later in the chapter.

Proteins  that  act  as  molecular  switches  fall  mostly  into  one  of  two 
classes. The first—and by far the largest—class consists of proteins that 
are activated or inactivated by phosphorylation, a chemical modification 
discussed in Chapter 4 (see Figure 4–42). For these molecules, the switch 
is thrown in one direction by a protein kinase, which covalently attaches 
a  phosphate  group  onto  the  switch  protein,  and  in  the  other  direction 
by a protein phosphatase, which takes the phosphate off again (Figure 
16–15a). The activity of any protein that is regulated by phosphorylation 
depends—moment by moment—on the balance between the activities of 
the protein kinases that phosphorylate it and the protein phosphatases 
that dephosphorylate it. 

ECB4 e16.13/16.13

Many of the switch proteins controlled by phosphorylation are themselves 
protein kinases, and these are often organized into phosphorylation cas-
cades: one protein kinase, activated by phosphorylation, phosphorylates 
the next protein kinase in the sequence, and so on, transmitting the sig-
nal onward and, in the process, amplifying, distributing, and regulating 
it.  Two  main  types  of  protein  kinases  operate  in  intracellular  signaling 
pathways: the most common are serine/threonine kinases, which—as 
the name implies—phosphorylate proteins on serines or threonines; oth-
ers are tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate proteins on tyrosines. 

The other class of switch proteins involved in intracellular signaling path-
ways  are  GTP-binding  proteins.  These  toggle  between  an  active  and 
an inactive state depending on whether they have GTP or GDP bound to

Figure 16–15 many intracellular signaling 
proteins act as molecular switches. these 
proteins can be activated—or in some cases 
inhibited—by the addition or removal of a 
phosphate group. (a) In one class of switch 
protein, the phosphate is added covalently 
by a protein kinase, which transfers the 
terminal phosphate group from atp to 
the signaling protein; the phosphate is 
then removed by a protein phosphatase. 
(B) In the other class of switch protein, a 
Gtp-binding protein is activated when it 
exchanges its bound GDp for Gtp (which, in 
a sense, adds a phosphate to the protein); 
the protein then switches itself off by 
hydrolyzing its bound Gtp to GDp. 

them, respectively (Figure 16–15B). Once activated by GTP binding, these 
proteins have intrinsic GTP-hydrolyzing (GTPase) activity, and they shut 
themselves off by hydrolyzing their bound GTP to GDP.  

ECB4 e16.14/16.15

Two  main  types  of  GTP-binding  proteins  participate  in  intracellular 
signaling  pathways.  Large,  trimeric  GTP-binding  proteins  (also  called  G 
proteins)  relay  messages  from  G-protein-coupled  receptors;  we  discuss 
this  major  class  of  GTP-binding  proteins  in  detail  shortly.  Other  cell-
surface  receptors  rely  on  small,  monomeric  GTPases  to  help  relay  their 
signals.  These  monomeric  GTP-binding  proteins  are  aided  by  two  sets 
of  regulatory  proteins.  Guanine  nucleotide  exchange  factors  (GEFs)  acti-
vate the switch proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP, and 
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) turn them off by promoting GTP hydrol-
ysis (Figure 16–16).

Cell-Surface Receptors Fall into three main Classes
All cell-surface receptor proteins bind to an extracellular signal molecule 
and transduce its message into one or more intracellular signaling mol-
ecules  that  alter  the  cell’s  behavior.  Most  of  these  receptors  belong  to 
one of three large classes, which differ in the transduction mechanism 
they use. 

1.  Ion-channel-coupled  receptors  change  the  permeability  of  the 
plasma membrane to selected ions, thereby altering the membrane 
potential  and,  if  the  conditions  are  right,  producing  an  electrical 
current (Figure 16–17a). 

2.  G-protein-coupled  receptors  activate  membrane-bound,  trimeric 
GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), which then activate (or inhibit) 
an enzyme or an ion channel in the plasma membrane, initiating 
an intracellular signaling cascade (Figure 16–17B). 

3.  Enzyme-coupled  receptors  either  act  as  enzymes  or  associate 
with  enzymes  inside  the  cell  (Figure  16–17C);  when  stimulated, 
the enzymes can activate a wide variety of intracellular signaling 
pathways. 

The number of different types of receptors in each of these three classes 
is even greater than the number of extracellular signals that act on them. 
This  is  because  for  many  extracellular  signal  molecules  there  is  more 
than  one  type  of  receptor,  and  these  may  belong  to  different  receptor 
classes. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, for example, acts on skel-
etal muscle cells via an ion-channel-coupled receptor, whereas in heart 
cells  it  acts  through  a  G-protein-coupled  receptor.  These  two  types  of

receptors  generate  different  intracellular  signals  and  thus  enable  the 
two types of cells to react to acetylcholine in different ways, increasing 
contraction in skeletal muscle and decreasing the rate of contractions in 
heart (see Figure 16–5A and C).

This  plethora  of  cell-surface  receptors  also  provides  targets  for  many 
foreign  substances  that  interfere  with  our  physiology,  from  heroin  and 
nicotine to tranquilizers and chili peppers. These substances either block 
or overstimulate the receptor’s natural activity. Many drugs and poisons 
act in this way (Table 16–2), and a large part of the pharmaceutical indus-
try is devoted to producing drugs that will exert a precisely defined effect 
by binding to a specific type of cell-surface receptor.

Ion-channel–coupled Receptors Convert Chemical Signals 
into Electrical Ones
Of all the types of cell-surface receptors, ion-channel-coupled  recep-
tors  (also  known  as  transmitter-gated  ion  channels)  function  in  the 
simplest and most direct way. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 12, these 
receptors  are  responsible  for  the  rapid  transmission  of  signals  across 
synapses  in  the  nervous  system.  They  transduce  a  chemical  signal,  in 
the  form  of  a  pulse  of  secreted  neurotransmitter  molecules  delivered 
to the outside of the target cell, directly into an electrical signal, in the

classes. (a) an ion-channel-coupled receptor opens in response to 
binding an extracellular signal molecule. these channels are also 
called transmitter-gated ion channels. (B) When a G-protein-coupled 
receptor binds its extracellular signal molecule, the activated 
receptor signals to a G protein on the opposite side of the plasma 
membrane, which then turns on (or off) an enzyme (or an ion channel; 
not shown) in the same membrane. For simplicity, the G protein 
is shown here as a single molecule; as we see later, it is actually a 
complex of three protein subunits. (c) When an enzyme-coupled 
receptor binds its extracellular signal molecule, an enzyme activity 
is switched on at the other end of the receptor, inside the cell. Many 
enzyme-coupled receptors have their own enzyme activity (left), while 
others rely on an enzyme that becomes associated with the activated 
receptor (right).

the signaling mechanisms used

channel-coupled receptor are 
relatively simple as they have few 
components. Can they lead to an 
amplification of the initial signal, 
and, if so, how?

form  of  a  change  in  voltage  across  the  target  cell’s  plasma  membrane 
(see Figure 12–40). When the neurotransmitter binds, this type of recep-
tor alters its conformation so as to open an ion channel in the plasma 
membrane, allowing the flow of specific types of ions, such as Na+, K+, or 
Ca2+ (see Figure 16–17A and movie 16.1). Driven by their electrochemical 
gradients, the ions rush into or out of the cell, creating a change in the 
membrane potential within milliseconds. This change in potential may 
trigger  a  nerve  impulse  or  make  it  easier  (or  harder)  for  other  neuro-
transmitters to do so. As we discuss later, the opening of Ca2+ channels 
has additional important effects, as changes in the Ca2+ concentration in 
the target cell cytosol can profoundly alter the activities of many Ca2+-
responsive proteins. 

Whereas  ion-channel-coupled  receptors  are  especially  important  in 
nerve  cells  and  other  electrically  excitable  cells  such  as  muscle  cells, 
G-protein-coupled receptors and enzyme-coupled receptors are impor-
tant for practically every cell type in the body. Most of the remainder of 
this chapter deals with these two receptor families and with the signal 
transduction processes that they use.

G-PROtEIN-COuPLEd RECEPtORS
G-protein-coupled  receptors  (GPCRs)  form  the  largest  family  of  cell-
surface receptors. There are more than 700 GPCRs in humans, and mice 
have about 1000 involved in the sense of smell alone. These receptors 
mediate responses to an enormous diversity of extracellular signal mol-
ecules, including hormones, local mediators, and neurotransmitters. The 
signal molecules are as varied in structure as they are in function: they can 
be proteins, small peptides, or derivatives of amino acids or fatty acids, 
and for each one of them there is a different receptor or set of receptors. 
Because  GPCRs  are  involved  in  such  a  large  variety  of  cell  processes, 
they are an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat many 
disorders. About one-third of all drugs used today work through GPCRs.

Despite the diversity of the signal molecules that bind to them, all GPCRs 
that have been analyzed have a similar structure: each is made of a single

polypeptide chain that threads back and forth across the lipid bilayer seven 
times  (Figure  16–18).  This  superfamily  of  seven-pass  transmembrane 
receptor  proteins  includes  rhodopsin  (the  light-activated  photoreceptor 
protein in the vertebrate eye), the olfactory (smell) receptors in the ver-
tebrate nose, and the receptors that participate in the mating rituals of 
single-celled  yeasts  (see  Figure  16–1).  Evolutionarily  speaking,  GPCRs 
are  ancient:  even  prokaryotes  possess  structurally  similar  membrane 
proteins—such as the bacteriorhodopsin that functions as a light-driven 
H+ pump (see Figure 11–27). Although they resemble eukaryotic GPCRs, 
these prokaryotic proteins do not act through G proteins, but are coupled 
to other signal transduction systems.

We begin this section with a discussion of how G proteins are activated 
by  GPCRs.  We  then  consider  how  activated  G  proteins  stimulate  ion 
channels and how they regulate membrane-bound enzymes that control 
the  concentrations  of  small  intracellular  messenger  molecules,  includ-
ing cyclic AMP and Ca2+—which in turn control the activity of important 
intracellular signaling proteins. We end with a discussion of how light-
activated GPCRs in photoreceptors in our eyes enable us to see.

Stimulation of GPCRs Activates G-Protein Subunits
When  an  extracellular  signal  molecule  binds  to  a  GPCR,  the  receptor 
protein undergoes a conformational change that enables it to activate a  
G protein located on the other side of the plasma membrane. To explain 
how this activation leads to the transmission of a signal, we must first 
consider how G proteins are constructed and how they function.

There are several varieties of G proteins. Each is specific for a particular 
set of receptors and for a particular set of target enzymes or ion channels 
in the plasma membrane. All of these G proteins, however, have a simi-
lar general structure and operate in a similar way. They are composed 
of three protein subunits—α, β, and γ—two of which are tethered to the 
plasma  membrane  by  short  lipid  tails.  In  the  unstimulated  state,  the α 
subunit has GDP bound to it, and the G protein is idle (Figure 16–19a). 
When an extracellular signal molecule binds to its receptor, the altered 
receptor activates a G protein by causing the α subunit to decrease its 
affinity for GDP, which is then exchanged for a molecule of GTP. In some 
cases, this activation breaks up the G-protein subunits, so that the acti-
vated α subunit, clutching its GTP, detaches from the βγ complex, which 
is also activated (Figure 16–19B). The two activated parts of the G pro-
tein—the α subunit and the βγ complex—can then each interact directly 
with target proteins in the plasma membrane, which in turn may relay the 
signal to other destinations in the cell. The longer these target proteins 
remain bound to an α or a βγ subunit, the more prolonged the relayed 
signal will be.

Figure 16–19 an activated gpCr 
activates g proteins by encouraging 
the α subunit to expel its gDp and pick 
up gTp. (a) In the unstimulated state, 
the receptor and the G protein are both 
inactive. although they are shown here as 
separate entities in the plasma membrane, 
in some cases at least, they are associated 
in a preformed complex. (B) Binding of an 
extracellular signal molecule to the receptor 
changes the conformation of the receptor, 
which in turn alters the conformation of 
the bound G protein. the alteration of 
the α subunit of the G protein allows it to 
exchange its GDp for Gtp. this exchange 
triggers an additional conformational 
change that activates both the α subunit 
and a βγ complex, which dissociate to 
interact with their preferred target proteins 
in the plasma membrane (movie 16.2). the 
receptor stays active as long as the external 
signal molecule is bound to it, and it can 
therefore catalyze the activation of many 
molecules of G protein. Note that both 
the α and γ subunits of the G protein have 
covalently attached lipid molecules (red ) 
that help anchor the subunits to the plasma 
membrane.

EFFECTOR ACTIVATION

The amount of time that the α and βγ subunits remain “switched on”—and 
hence available to relay signals—also determines how long a response 
lasts.  This  timing  is  controlled  by  the  behavior  of  the α  subunit.  The α 
subunit has an intrinsic GTPase activity, and it eventually hydrolyzes its 
bound GTP to GDP, returning the whole G protein to its original, inactive 
conformation  (Figure  16–20).  GTP  hydrolysis  and  inactivation  usually 
occur within seconds after the G protein has been activated. The inactive 
G protein is now ready to be reactivated by another activated receptor.

Some Bacterial toxins Cause disease by Altering the 
Activity of G Proteins
G proteins demonstrate a general principle of cell signaling mentioned 
earlier:  the  mechanisms  that  shut  a  signal  off  are  as  important  as  the 
mechanisms that turn it on (see Figure 16–15B). The shut-off mechanisms 
also offer as many opportunities for control—and as many dangers for 
mishap. Consider cholera, for example. The disease is caused by a bacte-
rium that multiplies in the human intestine, where it produces a protein 
called  cholera  toxin.  This  protein  enters  the  cells  that  line  the  intestine 
and modifies the α subunit of a G protein called Gs—so named because 

542 

ChapTEr 16     cell Signaling

Figure 16–20 The g-protein α subunit 
switches itself off by hydrolyzing its 
bound gTp to gDp. When an activated 
α subunit interacts with its target protein, 
it activates that target protein (or in some 
cases inactivates it; not shown) for as long 
as the two remain in contact. Normally 
the α subunit hydrolyzes its bound Gtp 
to GDp within seconds. this loss of Gtp 
inactivates the α subunit, which dissociates 
from its target protein and—if the α subunit 
had separated from the βγ complex (as 
shown)—reassociates with a βγ complex to 
re-form an inactive G protein. the G protein 
is now ready to couple to another activated 
receptor, as in Figure 16–19B. Both the 
activated α subunit and the activated 
βγ complex can interact with target proteins 
in the plasma membrane. See also

GPCRs activate G proteins by 
reducing the strength of GdP 
binding to the G protein. this 
results in rapid dissociation of 
bound GdP, which is then replaced 
by GtP, because GtP is present 
in the cytosol in much higher 
concentrations than GdP. What 
consequences would result from 
a mutation in the α subunit of a 
G protein that caused its affinity 
for GdP to be reduced without 
significantly changing its affinity for 
GtP? Compare the effects of this 
mutation with the effects of cholera 
toxin.

it stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which we discuss shortly. The 
modification  prevents  Gs  from  hydrolyzing  its  bound  GTP,  thus  lock-
ing the G protein in the active state, in which it continuously stimulates  
adenylyl cyclase. In intestinal cells, this stimulation causes a prolonged 
and  excessive  outflow  of  Cl–  and  water  into  the  gut,  resulting  in  cata-
strophic  diarrhea  and  dehydration.  The  condition  often  leads  to  death 
unless urgent steps are taken to replace the lost water and ions.

ECB4 e16.18/16.20

A similar situation occurs in whooping cough (pertussis), a common res-
piratory infection against which infants are now routinely vaccinated. In 
this case, the disease-causing bacterium colonizes the lung, where it pro-
duces a protein called pertussis toxin. This protein alters the α subunit of a 
different type of G protein, called Gi, because it inhibits adenylyl cyclase. 
In  this  case,  however,  modification  by  the  toxin  disables  the  G  protein 
by locking it into its inactive GDP-bound state. Inhibiting Gi, like activat-
ing Gs, results in the prolonged and inappropriate activation of adenylyl 
cyclase,  which,  in  this  case,  stimulates  coughing.  Both  the  diarrhea-
producing  effects  of  cholera  toxin  and  the  cough-provoking  effects  of 
pertussis toxin help the disease-causing bacteria move from host to host.

Some G Proteins directly Regulate Ion Channels
The target proteins recognized by G-protein subunits are either enzymes 
or ion channels in the plasma membrane. There are about 20 different 

types of mammalian G proteins, each activated by a particular set of cell-
surface  receptors  and  dedicated  to  activating  a  particular  set  of  target 
proteins. Consequently, the binding of an extracellular signal molecule to 
a GPCR leads to changes in the activities of a specific subset of the pos-
sible target proteins in the plasma membrane, leading to a response that 
is appropriate for that signal and that type of cell.

We look first at an example of direct G-protein regulation of ion channels. 
The heartbeat in animals is controlled by two sets of nerves: one speeds 
the  heart  up,  the  other  slows  it  down.  The  nerves  that  signal  a  slow-
down in heartbeat do so by releasing acetylcholine (see Figure 16–5A), 
which binds to a GPCR on the surface of the heart pacemaker cells. This 
GPCR activates the G protein, Gi. In this case, the βγ complex binds to the 
intracellular face of a K+ channel in the plasma membrane of the pace-
maker cell, forcing the ion channel into an open conformation (Figure 
16–21a and B). This channel opening slows the heart rate by increasing 
the  plasma  membrane’s  permeability  to  K+,  making  it  more  difficult  to 
electrically activate, as explained in Chapter 12. The original signal is ter-
minated—and the K+ channel recloses—when the α subunit inactivates 
itself by hydrolyzing its bound GTP, returning the G protein to its inactive 
state (Figure 16–21C).

many G Proteins Activate membrane-bound Enzymes that 
Produce Small messenger molecules
When  G  proteins  interact  with  ion  channels,  they  cause  an  immedi-
ate change in the state and behavior of the cell. Their interactions with 
enzymes, in contrast, have consequences that are less rapid and more 
complex,  as  they  lead  to  the  production  of  additional  intracellular  sig-
naling molecules. The two most frequent target enzymes for G proteins 
are  adenylyl  cyclase,  which  produces  the  small  intracellular  signaling 
molecule  cyclic  AMP,  and  phospholipase  C,  which  generates  the  small

messenger molecules, which bind to specific signaling proteins  
in the cell and influence their activity.

SIGNALING PROTEINS

intracellular signaling molecules inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. 
Inositol  trisphosphate,  in  turn,  promotes  the  accumulation  of  cytosolic 
Ca2+—yet another small intracellular signaling molecule. 

Adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C are activated by different types of 
G proteins, allowing cells to couple the production of these small intra-
cellular  signaling  molecules  to  different  extracellular  signals.  Although 
the coupling may be either stimulatory or inhibitory—as we saw in our 
discussion of the actions of cholera toxin and pertussis toxin—we con-
centrate here on G proteins that stimulate enzyme activity. 

The small intracellular signaling molecules generated by these enzymes 
are often called small messengers, or second messengers—the “first mes-
sengers”  being  the  extracellular  signals  that  activated  the  enzymes  in 
the first place. Once activated, the enzymes generate large quantities of 
small messengers, which rapidly diffuse away from their source, thereby 
amplifying and spreading the intracellular signal (Figure 16–22).

Different  small  messenger  molecules  produce  different  responses.  We 
first examine the consequences of an increase in the cytosolic concen-
tration of cyclic AMP. This will take us along one of the main types of 
signaling  pathways  that  lead  from  the  activation  of  GPCRs.  We  then 
discuss the actions of three other small messenger molecules—inositol 
trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+—which will lead us along a dif-
ferent signaling route.

the Cyclic AmP Signaling Pathway Can Activate Enzymes 
and turn On Genes

Many  extracellular  signals  acting  via  GPCRs  affect  the  activity  of  the 
enzyme adenylyl cyclase and thus alter the intracellular concentration 
of the small messenger molecule cyclic AMP. Most commonly, the acti-
vated  G-protein  α  subunit  switches  on  the  adenylyl  cyclase,  causing  a 
dramatic and sudden increase in the synthesis of cyclic AMP from ATP 
(which is always present in the cell). Because it stimulates the cyclase, 
this G protein is called Gs. To help terminate the signal, a second enzyme, 
called cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, rapidly converts cyclic AMP to ordi-
nary AMP (Figure 16–23). One way that caffeine acts as a stimulant is by 
inhibiting this phosphodiesterase in the nervous system, blocking cyclic 
AMP  degradation  and  thereby  keeping  the  concentration  of  this  small 
messenger high. 

Cyclic  AMP  phosphodiesterase  is  continuously  active  inside  the  cell. 
Because it eliminates cyclic AMP so quickly, the cytosolic concentration 
of this small messenger can change rapidly in response to extracellular 

Figure 16–23 Cyclic amp is synthesized by adenylyl cyclase 
and degraded by cyclic amp phosphodiesterase. cyclic aMp 
(abbreviated caMp) is formed from atp by a cyclization reaction that 
removes two phosphate groups from atp and joins the “free” end of 
the remaining phosphate group to the sugar part of the aMp molecule 
(red bond). the degradation reaction breaks this new bond, forming 
aMp.

signals,  rising  or  falling  tenfold  in  a  matter  of  seconds  (Figure  16–24). 
Cyclic  AMP  is  water-soluble,  so  it  can,  in  some  cases,  carry  the  signal 
throughout  the  cell,  traveling  from  the  site  on  the  membrane  where 
it  is  synthesized  to  interact  with  proteins  located  in  the  cytosol,  in  the 
nucleus, or on other organelles.

Cyclic  AMP  exerts  most  of  its  effects  by  activating  the  enzyme  cyclic-
AMP-dependent  protein  kinase  (PKA).  This  enzyme  is  normally  held 
inactive in a complex with a regulatory protein. The binding of cyclic AMP 
to  the  regulatory  protein  forces  a  conformational  change  that  releases 
the inhibition and unleashes the active kinase. Activated PKA then cata-
lyzes the phosphorylation of particular serines or threonines on specific 
intracellular proteins, thus altering the activity of these target proteins. In 
different cell types, different sets of proteins are available to be phospho-
rylated, which largely explains why the effects of cyclic AMP vary with the 
type of target cell. 

ECB4 e16.22/16.24

Many kinds of cell responses are mediated by cyclic AMP; a few are listed 
in  Table  16–3.  As  the  table  shows,  different  target  cells  respond  very 
differently  to  extracellular  signals  that  change  intracellular  cyclic  AMP 
concentrations.  When  we  are  frightened  or  excited,  for  example,  the 
adrenal gland releases the hormone adrenaline, which circulates in the 
bloodstream and binds to a class of GPCRs called adrenergic receptors 
(see Figure 16–18B), which are present on many types of cells. The con-
sequences vary from one cell type to another, but all the cell responses 
help prepare the body for sudden action. In skeletal muscle, for instance, 
adrenaline increases intracellular cyclic AMP, causing the breakdown of 
glycogen—the polymerized storage form of glucose. It does so by activat-
ing PKA, which leads to both the activation of an enzyme that promotes 
glycogen  breakdown  (Figure  16–25)  and  the  inhibition  of  an  enzyme 
that drives glycogen synthesis. By stimulating glycogen breakdown and

These fatty acids can then be exported to fuel ATP production in other 
cells.

In  some  cases,  the  effects  of  increasing  cyclic  AMP  are  rapid;  in  skel-
etal muscle, for example, glycogen breakdown occurs within seconds of 
adrenaline binding to its receptor (see Figure 16–25). In other cases, cyclic 
AMP responses involve changes in gene expression that take minutes or 
hours to develop. In these slow responses, PKA typically phosphorylates 
transcription regulators, which then activate the transcription of selected 
genes.  Thus  an  increase  in  cyclic  AMP  in  certain  neurons  in  the  brain 
controls the production of proteins involved in some forms of learning. 
Figure 16–26 illustrates a typical cyclic-AMP-mediated pathway from the 
plasma membrane to the nucleus.

We now turn to the other enzyme-mediated signaling pathway that leads 
from GPCRs—the pathway that begins with the activation of the mem-
brane-bound  enzyme  phospholipase  C  and  leads  to  an  increase  in  the 
small messengers diacylglycerol, inositol trisphosphate, and Ca2+.

the Inositol Phospholipid Pathway triggers a Rise in 
Intracellular Ca2+
Some GPCRs exert their effects via a G protein called Gq, which activates 
the  membrane-bound  enzyme  phospholipase  C  instead  of  adenylyl 
cyclase. Examples of signal molecules that act through phospholipase C 
are given in Table 16–4.

Binding of a signal molecule to its Gpcr 
can lead to the activation of adenylyl 
cyclase and a rise in the concentration of 
cytosolic cyclic aMp. the increase in cyclic 
aMp activates pKa, which then moves 
into the nucleus and phosphorylates 
specific transcription regulators. Once 
phosphorylated, these proteins stimulate 
the transcription of a whole set of target 
genes (movie 16.3). this type of signaling 
pathway controls many processes in 
cells, ranging from hormone synthesis 
in endocrine cells to the production of 
proteins involved in long-term memory 
in the brain. activated pKa can also 
phosphorylate and thereby regulate other 
proteins and enzymes in the cytosol (as 
shown in Figure 16–25).

Once activated, phospholipase C propagates the signal by cleaving a lipid 
molecule that is a component of the plasma membrane. The molecule is 
an inositol phospholipid (a phospholipid with the sugar inositol attached 
to its head) that is present in small quantities in the cytosolic leaflet of the 
membrane lipid bilayer (see Figure 11–18). Because of the involvement of 
this phospholipid, the signaling pathway that begins with the activation 
of phospholipase C is often referred to as the inositol phospholipid path-
way. It operates in almost all eukaryotic cells and can regulate a host of 
different effector proteins.

The action of phospholipase C generates two small messenger molecules: 
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Both mol-
ecules play a crucial part in relaying the signal (Figure 16–27).

ChapTEr 16     cell Signaling

Figure 16–27 phospholipase C activates 
two signaling pathways. two small 
messenger molecules are produced when 
a membrane inositol phospholipid is 
hydrolyzed by activated phospholipase c. 
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ip3) diffuses 
through the cytosol and triggers the 
release of ca2+ from the er by binding to 
and opening special ca2+ channels in the 
er membrane. the large electrochemical 
gradient for ca2+ across this membrane 
causes ca2+ to rush out of the er and into 
the cytosol. Diacylglycerol remains in the 
plasma membrane and, together with ca2+, 
helps activate the enzyme protein kinase c 
(pKc), which is recruited from the cytosol to 
the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. 
pKc then phosphorylates its own set of 
intracellular proteins, further propagating 
the signal. at the start of the pathway, 
both the α subunit and the βγ subunit of 
the G protein Gq are involved in activating 
phospholipase c.

IP3 is a water-soluble sugar phosphate that is released into the cytosol; 
there it binds to and opens Ca2+ channels that are embedded in the endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Ca2+ stored inside the ER rushes out 
into the cytosol through these open channels, causing a sharp rise in the 
cytosolic  concentration  of  free  Ca2+,  which  is  normally  kept  very  low. 
This Ca2+ in turn signals to other proteins, as discussed below.
Diacylglycerol is a lipid that remains embedded in the plasma membrane 
after it is produced by phospholipase C; there, it helps recruit and acti-
vate a protein kinase, which translocates from the cytosol to the plasma 
membrane. This enzyme is called protein kinase C (PKC) because it also 
needs to bind Ca2+ to become active (see Figure 16–27). Once activated, 
PKC phosphorylates a set of intracellular proteins that varies depending 
on the cell type. PKC operates on the same principle as PKA, although the 
proteins it phosphorylates are different.

A Ca2+ Signal triggers many Biological Processes
Ca2+ has such an important and widespread role as an intracellular mes-
senger  that  we  will  digress  to  consider  its  functions  more  generally.  A 
surge in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ is triggered by many kinds 
of cell stimuli, not only those that act through GPCRs. When a sperm ferti-
lizes an egg cell, for example, Ca2+ channels open, and the resulting rise 
in cytosolic Ca2+ triggers the egg to start development (Figure 16–28); for 
muscle cells, a signal from a nerve triggers a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that 
initiates muscle contraction; and in many secretory cells, including nerve 
cells, Ca2+ triggers secretion. Ca2+ stimulates all these responses by bind-
ing to and influencing the activity of various Ca2+-responsive proteins. 
The concentration of free Ca2+ in the cytosol of an unstimulated cell is 
extremely low (10–7 M) compared with its concentration in the extracel-
lular fluid (about 10–3 M) and in the ER. These differences are maintained 
by membrane-embedded Ca2+ pumps that actively remove Ca2+ from the 
cytosol—sending it either into the ER or across the plasma membrane and 
out of the cell. As a result, a steep electrochemical gradient of Ca2+ exists 
across both the ER membrane and the plasma membrane (discussed in 
Chapter 12). When a signal transiently opens Ca2+ channels in either of 
these  membranes,  Ca2+  rushes  down  its  electrochemical  gradient  into 
the cytosol, where it triggers changes in Ca2+-responsive proteins in the

dye before it was fertilized. When a sperm 
enters the egg, a wave of cytosolic ca2+ 
(red)—released from the er—sweeps 
across the egg from the site of sperm entry 
(arrow). this ca2+ wave provokes a change 
in the egg surface, preventing entry of 
other sperm, and it also initiates embryonic 
development. to catch this ca2+ wave, go

cytosol. The same Ca2+ pumps that normally operate to keep cytosolic 
Ca2+ concentrations low also help to terminate the Ca2+ signal.
The  effects  of  Ca2+  in  the  cytosol  are  largely  indirect,  in  that  they  are 
mediated  through  the  interaction  of  Ca2+  with  various  kinds  of  Ca2+-
responsive  proteins.  The  most  widespread  and  common  of  these  is 
calmodulin,  which  is  present  in  the  cytosol  of  all  eukaryotic  cells  that 
have  been  examined,  including  those  of  plants,  fungi,  and  protozoa. 
When Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, the protein undergoes a conformational 
change that enables it to interact with a wide range of target proteins in 
the cell, altering their activities (Figure 16–29). One particularly impor-
tant class of targets for calmodulin is the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent 
protein  kinases  (CaM-kinases).  When  these  kinases  are  activated  by 
binding to calmodulin complexed with Ca2+, they influence other proc-
esses in the cell by phosphorylating selected proteins. In the mammalian 
brain,  for  example,  a  neuron-specific  CaM-kinase  is  abundant  at  syn-
apses,  where  it  is  thought  to  play  an  important  part  in  some  forms  of 
learning and memory. This CaM-kinase is activated by the pulses of Ca2+ 
signals that occur during neural activity, and mutant mice that lack the 
kinase show a marked inability to remember where things are.

GPCR-triggered Intracellular Signaling Cascades Can 
Achieve Astonishing Speed, Sensitivity, and Adaptability 
The  steps  in  the  signaling  cascades  associated  with  GPCRs  take  a  long 
time to describe, but they often take only seconds to execute. Consider 
how quickly a thrill can make your heart race (when adrenaline stimu-
lates the GPCRs in your cardiac pacemaker cells), or how fast the smell 
of food can make your mouth water (through the GPCRs for odors in your

nose and the GPCRs for acetylcholine in salivary cells, which stimulate 
secretion). Among the fastest of all responses mediated by a GPCR, how-
ever, is the response of the eye to light: it takes only 20 msec for the most 
quickly responding photoreceptor cells of the retina (the cone photore-
ceptors, which are responsible for color vision in bright light) to produce 
their electrical response to a sudden flash of light.

This exceptional speed is achieved in spite of the necessity to relay the 
signal over multiple steps of an intracellular signaling cascade. But pho-
toreceptors also provide a beautiful illustration of the positive advantages 
of  intracellular  signaling  cascades:  in  particular,  such  cascades  allow 
spectacular amplification of the incoming signal and also allow cells to 
adapt so as to be able to detect signals of widely varying intensity. The 
quantitative details have been most thoroughly analyzed for the rod pho-
toreceptor cells in the eye, which are responsible for noncolor vision in 
dim  light  (Figure  16–30).  In  this  photoreceptor  cell,  light  is  sensed  by 
rhodopsin, a G-protein-coupled light receptor. Light-activated rhodopsin 
activates a G protein called transducin. The activated α subunit of trans-
ducin then activates an intracellular signaling cascade that causes cation 
channels to close in the plasma membrane of the photoreceptor cell. This 
produces a change in the voltage across the cell membrane, which alters 
neurotransmitter release and ultimately leads to a nerve impulse being 
sent to the brain. 

The signal is repeatedly amplified as it is relayed along this intracellular 
signaling pathway (Figure 16–31). When lighting conditions are dim, as 
on a moonless night, the amplification is enormous: as few as a dozen 
photons absorbed in the entire retina will cause a perceptible signal to be 
delivered to the brain. In bright sunlight, when photons flood through each 
photoreceptor cell at a rate of billions per second, the signaling cascade 
undergoes a form of adaptation, stepping down the amplification more 
than  10,000-fold,  so  that  the  photoreceptor  cells  are  not  overwhelmed 
and  can  still  register  increases  and  decreases  in  the  strong  light.  The 
adaptation  depends  on  negative  feedback:  an  intense  response  in  the 
photoreceptor cell decreases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, inhibiting 
the enzymes responsible for signal amplification.

Adaptation  frequently  occurs  in  intracellular  signaling  pathways  that 
respond  to  extracellular  signal  molecules,  allowing  cells  to  respond  to 
fluctuations in the concentration of such molecules regardless of whether 
they are present in small or large amounts. By taking advantage of posi-
tive and negative feedback mechanisms (see Figure 16–14), adaptation 
thus allows a cell to respond both to messages that are whispered and to 
those that are shouted. 

Figure 16–30 a rod photoreceptor cell from the retina is 
exquisitely sensitive to light. Drawing of a rod photoreceptor. the 
light-absorbing rhodopsin proteins are embedded in many pancake-
shaped vesicles (discs) of membrane inside the outer segment of the 
cell. Neurotransmitter is released from the opposite end of the cell to 
control firing of the retinal nerve cells that pass on the signal to the 
nerve cells in the retina that connect to the brain. When the rod cell is 
stimulated by light, a signal is relayed from the rhodopsin molecules 
in the discs, through the cytosol of the outer segment, to ion channels 
that allow positive ions to flow through the plasma membrane of 
the outer segment. these cation channels close in response to the 
cytosolic signal, producing a change in the membrane potential of the 
rod cell. By mechanisms similar to those that control neurotransmitter 
release in ordinary nerve cells, the change in membrane potential 
alters the rate of neurotransmitter release from the synaptic region of 
the cell. (adapted from t.L. Lentz, cell Fine Structure. philadelphia: 
Saunders, 1971. With permission from elsevier.)

Figure 16–31 The light-induced signaling cascade in rod 
photoreceptor cells greatly amplifies the light signal. When rod 
photoreceptors are adapted for dim light, signal amplification is 
enormous. the intracellular signaling pathway from the G protein 
transducin uses components that differ from the ones in previous 
figures. the cascade functions as follows. In the absence of a light 
signal, the small messenger molecule cyclic GMp is continuously 
produced by an enzyme in the cytosol of the photoreceptor cell. 
the cyclic GMp then binds to cation channels in the photoreceptor 
cell plasma membrane, keeping them open. activation of rhodopsin 
by light results in the activation of transducin α subunits. these turn 
on an enzyme called cyclic GMp phosphodiesterase, which breaks 
down cyclic GMp to GMp (much as cyclic aMp phosphodiesterase 
breaks down cyclic aMp; see Figure 16–23). the sharp fall in the 
cytosolic concentration of cyclic GMp causes the bound cyclic GMp 
to dissociate from the cation channels, which therefore close. closing 
these channels decreases the influx of Na+, thereby altering the 
voltage gradient (membrane potential) across the plasma membrane 
and, ultimately, the rate of neurotransmitter release, as described in 
chapter 12. the red arrows indicate the steps at which amplification 
occurs, with the thickness of the arrow roughly indicating the 
magnitude of the amplification.

Taste and smell also depend on GPCRs. It seems likely that this mechanism 
of signal reception, invented early in the evolution of the eukaryotes, has 
its origins in the basic and universal need of cells to sense and respond to 
their environment. Of course, GPCRs are not the only receptors that acti-
vate intracellular signaling cascades. We now turn to another major class 
of cell-surface receptors—enzyme-coupled receptors—which play a key 
part in controlling cell numbers, cell differentiation, and cell movement 
in multicellular animals, especially during development.

ENzymE-COuPLEd RECEPtORS
Like  GPCRs,  enzyme-coupled  receptors  are  transmembrane  proteins 
that  display  their  ligand-binding  domains  on  the  outer  surface  of  the 
plasma membrane (see Figure 16–17C). Instead of associating with a G 
protein, however, the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor either acts as 
an enzyme itself or forms a complex with another protein that acts as 
an  enzyme.  Enzyme-coupled  receptors  were  discovered  through  their 
role in responses to extracellular signal proteins (“growth factors”) that 
regulate  the  growth,  proliferation,  differentiation,  and  survival  of  cells 
in animal tissues (see Table 16–1, p. 529, for examples). Most of these 
signal proteins function as local mediators and can act at very low con-
centrations (about 10–9 to 10–11 M). Responses to them are typically slow 
(on the order of hours), and their effects may require many intracellular 
transduction steps that usually lead to a change in gene expression. 

Enzyme-coupled  receptors,  however,  can  also  mediate  direct,  rapid 
reconfigurations of the cytoskeleton, changing the cell’s shape and the 
way that it moves. The extracellular signals that induce such changes are 
often not diffusible signal proteins, but proteins attached to the surfaces 
over which a cell is crawling. 

The largest class of enzyme-coupled receptors consists of receptors with 
a cytoplasmic domain that functions as a tyrosine protein kinase, which 
phosphorylates  particular  tyrosines  on  specific  intracellular  signaling 
proteins. These receptors, called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), will 
be our main focus in this section. 

We  begin  with  a  discussion  of  how  RTKs  are  activated  in  response  to 
extracellular signals. We then consider how activated RTKs transmit the 

enzyme-coupled receptors

signal along two major intracellular signaling pathways that terminate at 
various effector proteins in the target cell. Finally, we describe how some 
enzyme-coupled receptors bypass such intracellular signaling cascades 
and use a more direct mechanism to regulate gene transcription.

Abnormal cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migra-
tion  are  fundamental  features  of  a  cancer  cell,  and  abnormalities  in 
signaling  via  RTKs  and  other  enzyme-coupled  receptors  have  a  major 
role in the development of most cancers.

Activated RtKs Recruit a Complex of Intracellular Signaling 
Proteins
To do its job as a signal transducer, an enzyme-coupled receptor has to 
switch on the enzyme activity of its intracellular domain (or of an associ-
ated enzyme) when an external signal molecule binds to its extracellular 
domain. Unlike the seven-pass transmembrane GPCRs, enzyme-coupled 
receptor proteins usually have only one transmembrane segment, which 
spans  the  lipid  bilayer  as  a  single  α  helix.  Because  a  single  α  helix  is 
poorly  suited  to  transmit  a  conformational  change  across  the  bilayer, 
enzyme-coupled receptors have a different strategy for transducing the 
extracellular signal. In many cases, the binding of an extracellular signal 
molecule causes two receptor molecules to come together in the plasma 
membrane, forming a dimer. This pairing brings the two intracellular tails 
of the receptors together, activating their kinase domains so that each 
receptor tail phosphorylates the other. In the case of RTKs, the phospho-
rylations occur on specific tyrosines. 

This tyrosine phosphorylation then triggers the assembly of a transient 
but  elaborate  intracellular  signaling  complex  on  the  cytosolic  tails  of 
the receptor. The newly phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites 
for  a  whole  zoo  of  intracellular  signaling  proteins—perhaps  as  many 
as 10 or 20 different molecules (Figure 16–32). Some of these proteins 
become  phosphorylated  and  activated  on  binding  to  the  receptor,  and 
they then propagate the signal; others function solely as scaffolds, which 
couple the receptor to other signaling proteins, thereby helping to build 
the  active  signaling  complex  (see  Figure  16–13).  All  of  these  docked

ACTIVATION OF DOWNSTREAM

INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS

Figure 16–32 activation of an rTK stimulates the assembly of an intracellular signaling complex. typically, the binding of a signal 
molecule to the extracellular domain of an rtK causes two receptor molecules to associate into a dimer. the signal molecule shown here 
is itself a dimer and thus can physically cross-link two receptor molecules; other signal molecules induce a conformational change in the 
rtKs, causing the receptors to dimerize (not shown). In either case, dimer formation brings the kinase domains of each cytosolic receptor 
tail into contact with the other; this activates the kinases to phosphorylate the adjacent tail on several tyrosines. each phosphorylated 
tyrosine serves as a specific docking site for a different intracellular signaling protein, which then helps relay the signal to the cell’s 
interior; these proteins contain a specialized interaction domain—in this case, a module called an Sh2 domain—that recognizes and 
binds to specific phosphorylated tyrosines on the cytosolic tail of an activated rtK or on another intracellular signaling protein.

intracellular signaling proteins possess a specialized interaction domain, 
which recognizes specific phosphorylated tyrosines on the receptor tails. 
Other interaction domains allow intracellular signaling proteins to rec-
ognize phosphorylated lipids that are produced on the cytosolic side of 
the plasma membrane in response to certain signals, as we discuss later. 

While  they  last,  the  signaling  protein  complexes  assembled  on  the 
cytosolic  tails  of  the  RTKs  can  transmit  a  signal  along  several  routes 
simultaneously to many destinations in the cell, thus activating and coor-
dinating the numerous biochemical changes that are required to trigger 
a complex response, such as cell proliferation or differentiation. To help 
terminate  the  response,  the  tyrosine  phosphorylations  are  reversed  by 
protein tyrosine phosphatases, which remove the phosphates that were 
added to the tyrosines of both the RTKs and other intracellular signaling 
proteins in response to the extracellular signal. In some cases, activated 
RTKs (as well as some GPCRs) are inactivated in a more brutal way: they 
are dragged into the interior of the cell by endocytosis and then destroyed 
by digestion in lysosomes.

Different RTKs recruit different collections of intracellular signaling pro-
teins, producing different effects; however, certain components are used 
by most RTKs. These include, for example, a phospholipase C that func-
tions  in  the  same  way  as  the  phospholipase  C  activated  by  GPCRs  to 
trigger the inositol phospholipid signaling pathway discussed earlier (see 
Figure 16–27). Another intracellular signaling protein that is activated by 
almost all RTKs is a small GTP-binding protein called Ras, as we discuss 
next.

most RtKs Activate the monomeric GtPase Ras
As  we  have  seen,  activated  RTKs  recruit  and  activate  many  kinds  of 
intracellular signaling proteins, leading to the formation of large signal-
ing complexes on the cytosolic tail of the RTK. One of the key members 
of these signaling complexes is Ras—a small GTP-binding protein that 
is bound by a lipid tail to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. 
Virtually all RTKs activate Ras, including platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) receptors, which mediate cell proliferation in wound healing, and 
nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors, which play an important part in the 
development of certain vertebrate neurons.

The Ras protein is a member of a large family of small GTP-binding pro-
teins,  often  called  monomeric  GTPases  to  distinguish  them  from  the 
trimeric G proteins that we encountered earlier. Ras resembles the α sub-
unit of a G protein and functions as a molecular switch in much the same 
way. It cycles between two distinct conformational states—active when 
GTP is bound and inactive when GDP is bound. Interaction with an acti-
vating protein called Ras-GEF encourages Ras to exchange its GDP for 
GTP, thus switching Ras to its activated state (Figure 16–33); after a delay, 
Ras is switched off by a GAP protein called Ras-GAP (see Figure 16–16), 
which promotes the hydrolysis of its bound GTP to GDP (movie 16.6).

In  its  active  state,  Ras  initiates  a  phosphorylation  cascade  in  which  a 
series  of  serine/threonine  protein  kinases  phosphorylate  and  activate 
one  another  in  sequence,  like  an  intracellular  game  of  dominoes.  This 
relay  system,  which  carries  the  signal  from  the  plasma  membrane  to 
the  nucleus,  includes  a  three-protein-kinase  module  called  the  MAP-
kinase signaling module, in honor of the final kinase in the chain, the 
mitogen-activated  protein  kinase,  or  MAP  kinase.  (As  we  discuss  in 
Chapter  18,  mitogens  are  extracellular  signal  molecules  that  stimulate 
cell proliferation.) In this pathway, outlined in Figure 16–34, MAP kinase

an adaptor protein docks on a particular 
phosphotyrosine on the activated receptor

bound to the receptor in Figure 16–32 
are omitted for simplicity). the adaptor 
recruits a ras guanine nucleotide exchange 
factor (ras-GeF) that stimulates ras to 
exchange its bound GDp for Gtp. the 
activated ras protein can now stimulate 
several downstream signaling pathways, 
one of which is shown in Figure 16–34. Note 
that the ras protein contains a covalently 
attached lipid group (red ) that helps anchor 
the protein to the inside of the plasma 
membrane.

MAP kinase kinase. And this protein is itself switched on by a MAP kinase 
kinase kinase (which is activated by Ras). At the end of the MAP-kinase 
cascade, MAP kinase phosphorylates various effector proteins, including 
certain transcription regulators, altering their ability to control gene tran-
scription. This change in the pattern of gene expression may stimulate 
cell proliferation, promote cell survival, or induce cell differentiation: the 
precise outcome will depend on which other genes are active in the cell 
and  what  other  signals  the  cell  receives.  How  biologists  unravel  such 
complex signaling pathways is discussed in how We Know, pp. 556–557.

Before Ras was discovered in normal cells, a mutant form of it was found 
in  human  cancer  cells;  the  mutation  inactivated  the  GTPase  activity  of 
Ras, so that the protein could not shut itself off, promoting uncontrolled 
cell proliferation and the development of cancer. About 30% of human 
cancers contain such activating mutations in a Ras gene; of the cancers 
that  do  not,  many  have  mutations  in  genes  that  encode  proteins  that 
function in the same signaling pathway as Ras. Many of the genes that 
encode normal intracellular signaling proteins were initially identified in 
the hunt for cancer-promoting oncogenes (discussed in Chapter 20).

an extracellular survival signal, such as 
IGF, activates an rtK, which recruits and 
activates pI 3-kinase. pI 3-kinase then 
phosphorylates an inositol phospholipid 
that is embedded in the cytosolic side 
of the plasma membrane. the resulting 
phosphorylated inositol phospholipid then 
attracts intracellular signaling proteins that 
have a special domain that recognizes it. 
One of these signaling proteins, akt, is 
a protein kinase that is activated at the 
membrane by phosphorylation mediated 
by two other protein kinases (here called 
protein kinases 1 and 2); protein kinase 1 
is also recruited by the phosphorylated 
lipid docking sites. Once activated, akt 
is released from the plasma membrane 
and phosphorylates various downstream 
proteins on specific serines and threonines 
(not shown).

RtKs Activate PI 3-Kinase to Produce Lipid docking Sites 
in the Plasma membrane
Many  of  the  extracellular  signal  proteins  that  stimulate  animal  cells  to 
survive and grow act through RTKs. These include signal proteins belong-
ing to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family. One crucially important 
signaling pathway that these RTKs activate to promote cell growth and 
survival relies on the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), 
which phosphorylates inositol phospholipids in the plasma membrane. 
These phosphorylated lipids then serve as docking sites for specific intra-
cellular signaling proteins, which relocate from the cytosol to the plasma 
membrane, where they can activate one another. One of the most impor-
tant of these relocated signaling proteins is the serine/threonine protein 
kinase Akt (Figure 16–35). 

Akt, also called protein kinase B (PKB), promotes the growth and survival 
of many cell types, often by inactivating the signaling proteins it phos-
phorylates. For example, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates a cytosolic 
protein called Bad. In its active state, Bad encourages the cell to kill itself 
by indirectly activating a cell-suicide program called apoptosis (discussed 
in  Chapter  18).  Phosphorylation  by  Akt  thus  promotes  cell  survival  by 
inactivating a protein that otherwise promotes cell death (Figure 16–36). 
In  addition  to  promoting  cell  survival,  the  PI-3-kinase–Akt  signaling 
pathway also stimulates cells to grow in size. It does so by indirectly acti-
vating  a  large  serine/threonine  kinase  called  Tor.  Tor  stimulates  cells 
to  grow  both  by  enhancing  protein  synthesis  and  by  inhibiting  protein

Bad promotes apoptosis (a form of cell death) by binding to and inhibiting a protein, 
called Bcl2, which otherwise suppresses apoptosis. When Bad is phosphorylated by 
akt, Bad releases Bcl2, which now blocks apoptosis, thereby promoting cell survival.

Intracellular signaling pathways are never mapped out in 
a single experiment. Although insulin was first isolated 
from  dog  pancreas  in  the  early  1920s,  the  molecular 
chain  of  events  that  links  the  binding  of  insulin  to  its 
receptor with the activation of the transporter proteins 
that  take  up  glucose  has  taken  decades  to  untangle—
and is still not completely understood. 

Instead, investigators figure out, piece by piece, how all 
the links in the chain fit together—and how each con-
tributes to the cell’s response to an extracellular signal 
molecule such as the hormone insulin. Here, we discuss 
the kinds of experiments that allow scientists to identify 
individual links and, ultimately, to piece together com-
plex signaling pathways.

Close encounters
Most signaling pathways depend on proteins that physi-
cally interact with one another. There are several ways 
to detect such direct contact. One involves using a pro-
tein as “bait.” For example, to isolate the receptor that 
binds to insulin, one could attach insulin to a chroma-
tography column. Cells that respond to the hormone are 
broken open and their contents poured over the column. 
Proteins that bind to insulin will stick to this column and 
can later be eluted and identified (see Figure 4–48). 

Protein–protein interactions in a signaling pathway can 
also be identified by co-immunoprecipitation. For exam-
ple,  cells  exposed  to  an  extracellular  signal  molecule 

can  be  broken  open,  and  antibodies  can  be  used  to 
grab the receptor protein known to recognize the signal 
molecule  (see  Panel  4–2,  pp.  146–147,  and  Panel  4–3, 
pp. 164–165). If the receptor is strongly associated with 
other  proteins,  these  will  be  captured  as  well.  In  this 
way,  researchers  can  identify  which  proteins  interact 
when an extracellular signal molecule stimulates cells. 

Once  two  proteins  are  known  to  bind  to  each  other, 
the  experimenter  can  use  recombinant  DNA  technol-
ogy to pinpoint which parts of the proteins are required 
for  the  interaction.  For  example,  to  determine  which 
phosphorylated  tyrosine  on  a  receptor  tyrosine  kinase 
(RTK)  a  certain  intracellular  signaling  protein  binds,  a 
series of mutant receptors is constructed, each missing 
a different tyrosine from its cytoplasmic domain (Figure 
16–37).  In  this  way,  the  specific  tyrosines  required  for 
binding can be determined. Similarly, one can determine 
whether  this  phosphotyrosine  docking  site  is  required 
for the receptor to transmit a signal to the cell.

Jamming the pathway
Ultimately, one wants to assess what part a particular 
protein  plays  in  a  signaling  pathway.  A  first  test  may 
involve  using  recombinant  DNA  technology  to  intro-
duce  into  cells  a  gene  encoding  a  constantly  active 
form  of  the  protein,  to  see  if  this  mimics  the  effect  of 
the  extracellular  signal  molecule.  Consider  Ras,  for 
example.  The  mutant  form  of  Ras  involved  in  human

Figure 16–37 mutant proteins can 
help to determine exactly where 
an intracellular signaling molecule 
binds. as shown in Figure 16–32, 
on binding their extracellular signal 
molecule, a pair of rtKs come 
together and phosphorylate specific 
tyrosines on each other’s cytoplasmic 
tails. these phosphorylated tyrosines 
attract different intracellular signaling 
proteins, which then become activated 
and pass on the signal. to determine 
which tyrosine binds to a specific 
intracellular signaling protein, a series 
of mutant receptors is constructed. In 
the mutants shown, tyrosines Y2 and Y3 
have been replaced, one at a time, by 
an alanine (red). as a result, the mutant 
receptors no longer bind to one of the 
intracellular signaling proteins shown 
in Figure 16–32. the effect on the cell’s 
response to the signal can then be 
determined. It is important that the 
mutant receptor be tested in a cell that 
does not have its own normal receptors 
for the signal molecule.

cancers is constantly active because it has lost its ability 
to hydrolyze the bound GTP that keeps the Ras protein 
switched on. This continuously active form of Ras can 
stimulate some cells to proliferate, even in the absence 
of a proliferation signal. 

Conversely,  a  specific  signaling  protein  can  be  inacti-
vated. In the case of Ras, for example, one could “knock 
down” the activity of the Ras gene in cells by RNA inter-
ference (see Figure 8–26). Such cells do not proliferate 
in  response  to  extracellular  mitogens,  indicating  the 
importance of normal Ras signaling in the proliferative 
response.

making mutants
One powerful strategy that scientists use to identify pro-
teins that participate in cell signaling involves screening 
tens  of  thousands  of  animals—fruit  flies  or  nematode 
worms, for example (discussed in Chapter 19)—to search 
for  mutants  in  which  a  signaling  pathway  is  not  func-
tioning properly. By examining enough mutant animals, 

many of the genes that encode the proteins involved in 
a signaling pathway can be identified.

Such classical genetic screens can also help determine 
the order in which intracellular signaling proteins act in 
a  pathway.  Suppose  that  a  genetic  screen  uncovers  a 
pair of new proteins, X and Y, involved in the Ras sign-
aling pathway. To determine whether these proteins lie 
upstream or downstream of Ras, one could create cells 
that express an inactive, mutant form of each, and then 
ask whether these mutant cells can be “rescued” by the 
addition of a continuously active form of Ras. If the con-
stantly  active  Ras  overcomes  the  blockage  created  by 
the mutant protein, the protein must operate upstream 
of Ras in the pathway (Figure 16–38a). However, if Ras 
operates upstream of the protein, a constantly active Ras 
would be unable to transmit a signal past the obstruction 
caused by the disabled protein (Figure 16–38B). Through 
such experiments, even the most complex intracellular 
signaling  pathways  can  be  mapped  out,  one  step  at  a 
time (Figure 16–38C).

Figure 16–38 The use of mutant cell lines and an overactive form of ras can help dissect an intracellular signaling pathway. 
In this hypothetical pathway, ras, protein X, and protein Y are required for proper signaling. (a) In cells in which protein X has been 
inactivated, signaling does not occur. however, this signaling blockage can be overcome by the addition of an overactive form of 
ras, such that the pathway is active even in the absence of the extracellular signal molecule. this result indicates that protein X acts 
upstream of ras in the pathway. (B) Signaling is also disrupted in cells in which protein Y has been inactivated. In this case, introduction 
of an overactive ras does not restore normal signaling, indicating that protein Y operates downstream of ras. (c) Based on these 
results, the deduced order of the signaling pathway is shown.

Figure 16–40 Both gpCrs and 
rTKs activate multiple intracellular 
signaling pathways. the figure reviews 
five of these pathways: two leading 
from Gpcrs—through adenylyl cyclase 
and through phospholipase c—and 
three leading from rtKs—through 
phospholipase c, ras, and  
pI 3-kinase. each pathway differs from 
the others, yet they use some common 
components to transmit their signals. 
Because all five eventually activate 
protein kinases, it seems that each 
is capable in principle of regulating 
practically any process in the cell.

Figure 16–39 akt stimulates cells to grow in size by activating the 
serine/threonine kinase Tor. the binding of a growth factor to an rtK 
activates the pI-3-kinase–akt signaling pathway (as shown in  
Figure 16–35). akt then indirectly activates tor by phosphorylating 
and inhibiting a protein that helps to keep tor shut down (not shown). 
tor stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation by 
phosphorylating key proteins in these processes (not shown). the 
anticancer drug rapamycin slows cell growth by inhibiting tor. In fact, 
the tor protein derives its name from the fact that it is a target of 
rapamycin.

degradation  (Figure  16–39).  The  anticancer  drug  rapamycin  works  by 
inactivating Tor, indicating the importance of this signaling pathway in 
regulating cell growth and survival—and the consequences of its disregu-
lation in cancer.
Figure 16–40 summarizes the main intracellular signaling cascades acti-
vated by GPCRs and RTKs.

Some Receptors Activate a Fast track to the Nucleus
Not all receptors trigger complex signaling cascades to carry a message 
to the nucleus. Some use a more direct route to control gene expression. 
One such receptor is the protein Notch.

Notch is a crucially important receptor in all animals, both during devel-
opment and in adults. Among other things, it controls the development of 
neural cells in Drosophila, as mentioned earlier (see Figure 16–4). In this 
simple signaling pathway, the receptor itself acts as a transcription regu-
lator. When activated by the binding of Delta, which is a transmembrane 
signal protein on the surface of a neighboring cell, the Notch receptor is 
cleaved. This cleavage releases the cytosolic tail of the receptor, which is 
then free to move to the nucleus where it helps to activate the appropri-
ate set of Notch-responsive genes (Figure 16–41).

Cell–Cell Communication Evolved Independently in Plants 
and Animals
Plants and animals have been evolving independently for more than a bil-
lion years, the last common ancestor being a single-celled eukaryote that 
most likely lived on its own. Because these kingdoms diverged so long 
ago—when it was still “every cell for itself”—each has evolved its own 
molecular solutions to the complex problem of becoming multicellular. 
Thus the mechanisms for cell–cell communication in plants and animals 
are in some ways quite different. At the same time, however, plants and 
animals started with a common set of eukaryotic genes—including some 
used by single-celled organisms to communicate among themselves—so 
their signaling systems also show some similarities.

ECB4 e16.40/16.42

Like animals, plants make extensive use of transmembrane cell-surface 
receptors—especially  enzyme-coupled  receptors.  The  spindly  weed 
Arabidopsis  thaliana  (see  Figure  1–32)  has  hundreds  of  genes  encoding 
receptor serine/threonine kinases. These are, however, structurally distinct 
from the receptor serine/threonine kinases found in animal cells (which 
we do not discuss in this chapter). The plant receptors are thought to play 
an important part in a large variety of cell signaling processes, including 
those governing plant growth, development, and disease resistance. In 
contrast to animal cells, plant cells seem not to use RTKs, steroid-hor-
mone-type nuclear receptors, or cyclic AMP, and they seem to use few 
GPCRs.

One of the best-studied signaling systems in plants mediates the response 
of cells to ethylene—a gaseous hormone that regulates a diverse array 
of developmental processes, including seed germination and fruit ripen-
ing. Tomato  growers use  ethylene to  ripen their  fruit, even  after  it  has 
been picked. Although ethylene receptors are not evolutionarily related 
to any of the classes of receptor proteins that we have discussed so far, 
they function as enzyme-coupled receptors. Surprisingly, it is the empty 
receptor  that  is  active:  in  the  absence  of  ethylene,  the  empty  receptor 
activates an associated protein kinase that ultimately shuts off the eth-
ylene-responsive  genes  in  the  nucleus;  when  ethylene  is  present,  the 
receptor and kinase are inactive, and the ethylene-responsive genes are 
transcribed (Figure 16–42). This strategy, whereby signals act to relieve 
transcriptional inhibition, is commonly used in plants. 

560 

ChapTEr 16     cell Signaling

Figure 16–42 The ethylene signaling 
pathway turns on genes by relieving 
inhibition. (a) In the absence of ethylene, 
the receptor directly activates an 
associated protein kinase, which then 
indirectly promotes the destruction of the 
transcription regulator that switches on 
ethylene-responsive genes. as a result, the 
genes remain turned off. (B) In the presence 
of ethylene, the receptor and kinase 
are both inactive, and the transcription 
regulator remains intact and stimulates the 
transcription of the ethylene-responsive 
genes. the kinase that ethylene receptors 
interact with is a serine/threonine kinase 
that is closely related to the Map kinase 
kinase kinase found in animal cells (see 
Figure 16–34).

Protein Kinase Networks Integrate Information to Control 
Complex Cell Behaviors
Although the signaling pathways we have described thus far may seem 
dauntingly  complex,  the  complexity  of  cell  signaling  is  actually  much 
greater than we have let on. First, we have not discussed all of the intra-
cellular signaling pathways that operate in cells, even though many of 
these are critical for normal development. Second, although we depict 
these signaling pathways as being linear and self-contained, they do not 
work independently of one another. Instead, they are connected by inter-
actions of many sorts. The most extensive links are those mediated by 
the protein kinases present in each pathway. These kinases often phos-
phorylate, and hence regulate, components in other signaling pathways, 
in addition to components in their own pathway. Thus a certain amount 
of cross-talk occurs between the different pathways. To give an idea of 
the  scale  of  the  complexity,  genome  sequencing  studies  suggest  that 
about 2% of our ~21,000 protein-coding genes code for protein kinases; 
moreover,  hundreds  of  distinct  types  of  protein  kinases  are  thought  to 
be present in a single mammalian cell. How can we make sense of this 
tangled web of interacting signaling pathways, and what is the function 
of such complexity?

ECB4 e16.41/16.43

A cell receives messages from many sources, and it must integrate this 
information to generate an appropriate response: to live or die, to divide, 
to differentiate, to change shape, to move, to send out a chemical mes-
sage of its own, and so on (see Figure 16–6 and movies 16.7 and 16.8). 
Through  the  cross-talk  between  signaling  pathways,  the  cell  is  able  to 
bring together multiple bits of information and react to the combination. 
Thus  some  intracellular  signaling  proteins  act  as  integrating  devices, 
usually by having several potential phosphorylation sites, each of which 
can be phosphorylated by a different protein kinase. Information received 
from different sources can converge on such proteins, which then convert 
the input to a single outgoing signal (Figure 16–43, and see Figure 16–13). 
The integrating proteins in turn can deliver a signal to many downstream 

essential concepts         

561

Figure 16–43 Intracellular signaling 
proteins serve to integrate incoming 
signals. extracellular signals a, B, c, 
and D activate different receptors in the 
plasma membrane. the receptors act 
upon two protein kinases, which they 
either activate (arrowhead) or inhibit 
(crossbar). the kinases phosphorylate 
a same target protein and when it is 
fully phosphorylated, the target protein 
triggers a cellular response.
   It can be seen that signal molecule 
B activates both protein kinases and 
therefore produces a strong output 
response. Signals a and D each activate 
a different kinase and therefore produce 
a response only if they are simultaneously 
present. Signal molecule c inhibits the 
cell response and will compete with the 
other signal molecules. the net outcome 
will depend both on the numbers of 
signaling molecules and the strengths 
of their connections. In a real cell these 
parameters would be determined by 
evolution.

work of nerve cells in the brain—or like a collection of microprocessors in 
a computer—interpreting complex information and generating complex 
responses.

ECB4 e16.43/16.45

Our  understanding  of  these  intricate  networks  is  still  evolving:  we  are 
still  discovering  new  links  in  the  chains,  new  signaling  partners,  new 
connections, and even new pathways. Unraveling the intracellular sig-
naling pathways—in both animals and plants—is one of the most active 
areas  of  research  in  cell  biology,  and  new  discoveries  are  being  made 
every day. Genome sequencing projects continue to provide long lists of 
components involved in signal transduction in a large variety of organ-
isms. Even when we have identified all the components, however, it will 
remain a major challenge to figure out exactly how they work together to 
allow cells to integrate the diverse array of signals in their environment 
and respond in the appropriate manner. 

In a way, learning how cells “think” is a problem akin to learning how 
we, as humans, think. Although we know, for example, how neurotrans-
mitters  activate  certain  neurons  and  how  one  neuron  communicates 
with another, we are nowhere near understanding how all these compo-
nents operate together to enable us to reason, converse, laugh, love, and 
attempt to uncover the fundamental features of life on Earth.

lum,	releasing	a	flood	of	free	Ca2+ ions into the cytosol. The Ca2+ itself 
acts	as	a	second	messenger,	altering	the	activity	of	a	wide	range	of	
Ca2+-responsive	proteins.	These	include	calmodulin,	which	activates	
various	target	proteins	such	as	Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinases (CaM-kinases) .

•	 A	rise	in	cyclic	AMP	activates	protein	kinase	A	(PKA),	while	Ca2+ and

•	 PKA,	 PKC,	 and	 CaM-kinases	 phosphorylate	 selected	 signaling	 and	
effector	 proteins	 on	 serines	 and	 threonines,	 thereby	 altering	 their	
activity.	 Different	 cell	 types	 contain	 different	 sets	 of	 signaling	 and

Many  enzyme-coupled  receptors  are  receptor  tyrosine  kinases 
(RTKs),	 which	 phosphorylate	 themselves	 and	 selected	 intracellular	
signaling proteins on tyrosines. The phosphotyrosines on RTKs then 
serve	as	docking	sites	for	various	intracellular	signaling	proteins.	

•	 Most	RTKs	activate	the	monomeric	GTPase	Ras,	which,	in	turn,	acti-
vates	a	three-protein	MAP-kinase	signaling	module	that	helps	relay

If some cell-surface receptors, including Notch, can rapidly

A.  the extracellular signal molecule acetylcholine has 
different effects on different cell types in an animal and 
often binds to different cell-surface receptor molecules on 
different cell types. 
B.  After acetylcholine is secreted from cells, it is long-lived, 
because it has to reach target cells all over the body.
C.  Both the GtP-bound α subunits and nucleotide-free βγ

phosphate group.

E.  Calmodulin regulates the intracellular Ca2+

the Ras protein functions as a molecular switch that is set 
to its “on” state by other proteins that cause it to expel 
its bound GdP and bind GtP. A GtPase-activating protein 
helps reset the switch to the “off” state by inducing Ras to 
hydrolyze its bound GtP to GdP much more rapidly than it 
would without this encouragement. thus, Ras works like a 
light switch that one person turns on and another turns off. 
you are given a mutant cell that lacks the GtPase-activating 
protein. What abnormalities would you expect to find in the 
way in which Ras activity responds to extracellular signals?

“One of the great kings of the past ruled an enormous 
kingdom that was more beautiful than anywhere else in 
the world. Every plant glistened as brilliantly as polished 
jade, and the softly rolling hills were as sleek as the waves 
of the summer sea. the wisdom of all of his decisions 
relied on a constant flow of information brought to him 
daily by messengers who told him about every detail of his 
kingdom so that he could take quick, appropriate actions 
when needed. despite the beauty and efficiency, his people 
felt doomed living under his rule, for he had an adviser 
who had studied cell signal transduction and accordingly 
administered the king’s department of Information. the 
adviser had implemented the policy that all messengers 
will be immediately beheaded whenever spotted by the 
Royal Guard, because for rapid signaling the lifetime of 
messengers ought to be short. their plea “don’t hurt me, 
I’m only the messenger!” was to no avail, and the people 
of the kingdom suffered terribly because of the rapid loss 
of their sons and daughters.” Why is the analogy on which 
the king’s adviser based his policies inappropriate? Briefly

Cytoskeleton

The  ability  of  eukaryotic  cells  to  adopt  a  variety  of  shapes,  organize 
the  many  components  in  their  interior,  interact  mechanically  with  the 
environment,  and  carry  out  coordinated  movements  depends  on  the 
cytoskeleton—an  intricate  network  of  protein  filaments  that  extends 
throughout  the  cytoplasm  (Figure  17–1).  This  filamentous  architecture 
helps to support the large volume of cytoplasm, a function that is particu-
larly important in animal cells, which have no cell walls. Although some 
cytoskeletal components are present in bacteria, the cytoskeleton is most 
prominent in the large and structurally complex eukaryotic cell. 

Unlike  our  own  bony  skeleton,  however,  the  cytoskeleton  is  a  highly 
dynamic  structure  that  is  continuously  reorganized  as  a  cell  changes 
shape, divides, and responds to its environment. The cytoskeleton is not 
only the “bones” of a cell but its “muscles” too, and it is directly respon-
sible for large-scale movements, including the crawling of cells along a 
surface, the contraction of muscle cells, and the changes in cell shape 
that take place as an embryo develops. Without the cytoskeleton, wounds 
would never heal, muscles would not contract, and sperm would never 
reach the egg.

Like  any  factory  making  a  complex  product,  the  eukaryotic  cell  has  a 
highly organized interior in which organelles that carry out specialized 
functions are concentrated in different areas and linked by transport sys-
tems (discussed in Chapter 15). The cytoskeleton controls the location of 
the organelles and provides the machinery for transport between them. It 
is also responsible for the segregation of chromosomes into two daugh-
ter cells at cell division and for pinching apart those two new cells, as we 
discuss in Chapter 18.

Figure 17–2 The three types of protein 
filaments that form the cytoskeleton 
differ in their composition, mechanical 
properties, and roles inside the cell. they 
are shown here in epithelial cells, but they 
are all found in almost all animal cells.

Figure 17–1 The cytoskeleton gives a cell its shape and allows the 
cell to organize its internal components and to move. an animal 
cell in culture has been labeled to show two of its major cytoskeletal 
systems, the microtubules (green) and the actin filaments (red ). Where 
the two filaments overlap, they appear yellow. the DNa in the nucleus 
is labeled in blue. (courtesy of albert tousson.) 

The cytoskeleton is built on a framework of three types of protein fila-
ments: intermediate filaments, microtubules, and actin filaments. Each type 
of filament has distinct mechanical properties and is formed from a dif-
ferent protein subunit. A family of fibrous proteins forms the intermediate 
filaments; globular tubulin subunits form microtubules; and globular actin 
subunits form actin filaments (Figure 17–2). In each case, thousands of 
subunits  assemble  into  fine  threads  that  sometimes  extend  across  the 
entire cell.

In this chapter, we consider the structure and function of each of these 
protein filament networks. We begin with intermediate filaments, which 
provide cells with mechanical strength. We then see how microtubules 
organize the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and form the hairlike motile 
appendages that enable cells like protozoa and sperm to swim. We next 
consider how the actin cytoskeleton supports the cell surface and allows 
fibroblasts  and  other  cells  to  crawl.  Finally,  we  discuss  how  the  actin 
cytoskeleton enables our muscles to contract.

Intermediate ﬁlaments are ropelike ﬁbers with a 
diameter of about 10 nm; they are made of 
ﬁbrous intermediate ﬁlament proteins. One 
type of intermediate ﬁlament forms a 
meshwork called the nuclear lamina just 
beneath the inner nuclear membrane. Other 
types extend across the cytoplasm, giving cells 
mechanical strength and distributing the 
mechanical stresses in an epithelial tissue by 
spanning the cytoplasm from one cell–cell 
junction to another. Intermediate ﬁlaments are 
very ﬂexible and have great tensile strength. 
They deform under stress but do not rupture. 
(Micrograph courtesy of Roy Quinlan.) 

Microtubules are hollow cylinders made of the 
protein tubulin. They are long and straight and 
typically have one end attached to a single 
microtubule-organizing center called a 
centrosome. With an outer diameter of 25 nm, 
microtubules are more rigid than actin ﬁlaments 
or intermediate ﬁlaments, and they rupture 
when stretched. (Micrograph courtesy of 
Richard Wade.) 
 

Actin ﬁlaments (also known as microﬁlaments) 
are helical polymers of the protein actin. They 
are ﬂexible structures, with a diameter of about 
7 nm, that are organized into a variety of linear 
bundles, two-dimensional networks, and 
three-dimensional gels. Although actin 
ﬁlaments are dispersed throughout the cell, 
they are most highly concentrated in the cortex,
the layer of cytoplasm just beneath the plasma 
membrane. (Micrograph courtesy of Roger 
Craig.)        

Intermediate Filaments

intermediate filaments
Intermediate filaments have great tensile strength, and their main func-
tion is to enable cells to withstand the mechanical stress that occurs when 
cells  are  stretched.  The  filaments  are  called  “intermediate”  because,  in 
the  smooth  muscle  cells  where  they  were  first  discovered,  their  diam-
eter  (about  10  nm)  is  between  that  of  the  thinner  actin  filaments  and 
the thicker myosin filaments. Intermediate filaments are the toughest and 
most durable of the cytoskeletal filaments: when cells are treated with 
concentrated  salt  solutions  and  nonionic  detergents,  the  intermediate 
filaments survive, while most of the rest of the cytoskeleton is destroyed. 

Intermediate filaments are found in the cytoplasm of most animal cells. 
They  typically  form  a  network  throughout  the  cytoplasm,  surround-
ing the nucleus and extending out to the cell periphery. There they are 
often  anchored  to  the  plasma  membrane  at  cell–cell  junctions  called 
desmosomes (discussed in Chapter 20), where the plasma membrane is 
connected to that of another cell (Figure  17–3). Intermediate filaments 
are also found within the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. There they form a 
meshwork called the nuclear lamina, which underlies and strengthens the 
nuclear envelope. In this section, we see how the structure and assembly 
of intermediate filaments makes them particularly suited to strengthen-
ing cells and protecting them from tearing.

intermediate filaments are strong and ropelike
An intermediate filament is like a rope in which many long strands are 
twisted together to provide tensile strength (Movie 17.1). The strands of 
this  cable  are  made  of  intermediate  filament  proteins,  fibrous  subunits 
each  containing  a  central  elongated  rod  domain  with  distinct  unstruc-
tured domains at either end (Figure 17–4a). The rod domain consists of 
an extended α-helical region that enables pairs of intermediate filament

Figure 17–4 Intermediate filaments are like ropes made of long, twisted strands of protein. the intermediate 
filament monomer consists of an α-helical central rod domain (a) with unstructured regions at either end (not shown). 
pairs of monomers associate to form a dimer (B), and two dimers then line up to form a staggered, antiparallel 
tetramer (c). tetramers can pack together into a helical array containing eight tetramer strands (D), which in turn 
assemble into the final ropelike intermediate filament (e). an electron micrograph of intermediate filaments is shown

proteins to form stable dimers by wrapping around each other in a coiled-
coil configuration (Figure 17–4B), as described in Chapter 4. Two of these 
coiled-coil  dimers,  running  in  opposite  directions,  associate  to  form  a 
staggered tetramer (Figure 17–4C). These dimers and tetramers are the 
soluble subunits of intermediate filaments. The tetramers associate with 
each other side-by-side (Figure 17–4D) and then assemble to generate 
the final ropelike intermediate filament (Figure 17–4E).

ECB4 e17.03/17.04

Because the two dimers point in opposite directions, the two ends of the 
tetramer are the same, as are the two ends of assembled intermediate 
filaments; as we will see, this distinguishes these filaments from micro-
tubules and actin filaments, whose structural polarity is crucial for their 
function. All the interactions between the intermediate filament proteins 
depend solely on noncovalent bonding; it is the combined strength of the 
overlapping lateral interactions along the length of the proteins that gives 
intermediate filaments their great tensile strength.

The central rod domains of different intermediate filament proteins are all 
similar in size and amino acid sequence, so that when they pack together 
they  always  form  filaments  of  similar  diameter  and  internal  structure. 
By contrast, the terminal domains vary greatly in both size and amino 
acid sequence from one type of intermediate filament protein to another. 

Intermediate Filaments         

569

These unstructured domains are exposed on the surface of the filament, 
where they allow it to interact with specific components in the cytoplasm. 

intermediate filaments strengthen cells against 
mechanical stress
Intermediate filaments are particularly prominent in the cytoplasm of cells 
that are subject to mechanical stress. They are present in large numbers, 
for  example,  along  the  length  of  nerve  cell  axons,  providing  essential 
internal reinforcement to these extremely long and fine cell extensions. 
They  are  also  abundant  in  muscle  cells  and  in  epithelial  cells  such  as 
those of the skin. In all these cells, intermediate filaments distribute the 
effect  of  locally  applied  forces,  thereby  keeping  cells  and  their  mem-
branes from tearing in response to mechanical shear. A similar principle 
is used to strengthen composite materials such as fiberglass or reinforced 
concrete, in which tension-bearing linear elements such as carbon fibers 
(in fiberglass) or steel bars (in concrete) are embedded in a space-filling 
matrix to give the material strength.

Intermediate  filaments  can  be  grouped  into  four  classes:  (1)  keratin  fil-
aments  in  epithelial  cells;  (2)  vimentin  and  vimentin-related  filaments  in 
connective-tissue cells, muscle cells, and supporting cells of the nervous 
system (glial cells); (3) neurofilaments in nerve cells; and (4) nuclear lam-
ins, which strengthen the nuclear envelope. The first three filament types 
are found in the cytoplasm, whereas the fourth is found in the nucleus 
(Figure 17–5). Filaments of each class are formed by polymerization of 
their corresponding intermediate filament subunits.

The  keratin  filaments  are  the  most  diverse  class  of  intermediate  fila-
ment.  Every  kind  of  epithelium  in  the  vertebrate  body—whether  in  the 
tongue, the cornea, or the lining of the gut—has its own distinctive mix-
ture of keratin proteins. Specialized keratins also occur in hair, feathers, 
and claws. In each case, the keratin filaments are formed from a mixture 
of different keratin subunits. Keratin filaments typically span the interiors 
of epithelial cells from one side of the cell to the other, and filaments in 
adjacent  epithelial  cells  are  indirectly  connected  through  desmosomes 
(see Figure 17–3B). The ends of the keratin filaments are anchored to the 
desmosomes, and the filaments associate laterally with other cell compo-
nents through the globular head and tail domains that project from their 
surface.  This  cabling  of  high  tensile  strength,  formed  by  the  filaments 
throughout the epithelial sheet, distributes the stress that occurs when 
the skin is stretched. The importance of this function is illustrated by the 
rare human genetic disease epidermolysis bullosa simplex, in which muta-
tions in the keratin genes interfere with the formation of keratin filaments 
in the epidermis. As a result, the skin is highly vulnerable to mechanical 
injury, and even a gentle pressure can rupture its cells, causing the skin

MBoC5 16.19/16.21

Many of the intermediate filaments are further stabilized and reinforced 
by accessory proteins, such as plectin, that cross-link the filaments into 
bundles and link them to microtubules, to actin filaments, and to adhe-
sive structures in the desmosomes (Figure 17–7). Mutations in the gene 
for  plectin  cause  a  devastating  human  disease  that  combines  features 
of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (caused by disruption of skin keratin), 
muscular  dystrophy  (caused  by  disruption  of  intermediate  filaments  in 
muscle),  and  neurodegeneration  (caused  by  disruption  of  neurofila-
ments). Mice lacking a functional plectin gene die within a few days of 
birth, with blistered skin and abnormal skeletal and heart muscle. Thus 
although plectin may not be necessary for the initial formation of inter-
mediate  filaments,  its  cross-linking  action  is  required  to  provide  cells 
with the strength they need to withstand mechanical stress.

the nuclear envelope is supported by a meshwork of 
intermediate filaments
Whereas cytoplasmic intermediate filaments form ropelike structures, the 
intermediate filaments lining and strengthening the inside surface of the 
inner nuclear membrane are organized as a two-dimensional meshwork 
(Figure 17–8). As mentioned earlier, the intermediate filaments that form 
this tough nuclear lamina are constructed from a class of intermediate 
filament proteins called lamins (not to be confused with laminin, which is 
an extracellular matrix protein). The nuclear lamina disassembles and re-
forms at each cell division, when the nuclear envelope breaks down during 
mitosis and then re-forms in each daughter cell (discussed in Chapter 18). 
Cytoplasmic intermediate filaments also disassemble in mitosis.

The  disassembly  and  reassembly  of  the  nuclear  lamina  are  controlled 
by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the lamins. When the

lamins are phosphorylated by protein kinases (discussed in Chapter 4), 
the consequent conformational change weakens the binding between the 
lamin tetramers and causes the filaments to fall apart. Dephosphorylation 
by protein phosphatases at the end of mitosis causes the lamins to reas-
semble (see Figure 18–30).

Defects  in  a  particular  nuclear  lamin  are  associated  with  certain  types 
of progeria—rare disorders that cause affected individuals to age prema-
turely. Children with progeria have wrinkled skin, lose their teeth and hair, 
and often develop severe cardiovascular disease by the time they reach 
their teens (Figure 17–9). How the loss of a nuclear lamin could lead to 
this devastating condition is not yet known, but it may be that the result-
ing nuclear instability leads to impaired cell division, increased cell death, 
a diminished capacity for tissue repair, or some combination of these.

microtubules
Microtubules have a crucial organizing role in all eukaryotic cells. These 
long and relatively stiff hollow tubes of protein can rapidly disassemble in 
one location and reassemble in another. In a typical animal cell, microtu-
bules grow out from a small structure near the center of the cell called the 
centrosome (Figure 17–10a and B). Extending out toward the cell periph-
ery, they create a system of tracks within the cell, along which vesicles, 
organelles, and other cell components can be transported. These cyto-
plasmic microtubules are the part of the cytoskeleton mainly responsible 
for transporting and positioning membrane-enclosed organelles within 
the  cell  and  for  guiding  the  intracellular  transport  of  various  cytosolic 
macromolecules. 

When  a  cell  enters  mitosis,  the  cytoplasmic  microtubules  disassemble 
and then reassemble into an intricate structure called the mitotic spindle. 
As we discuss in Chapter 18, the mitotic spindle provides the machinery 
that will segregate the chromosomes equally into the two daughter cells 
just  before  a  cell  divides  (Figure  17–10C).  Microtubules  can  also  form 
stable structures, such as rhythmically beating cilia and flagella (Figure 
17–10D).  These  hairlike  structures  extend  from  the  surface  of  many 
eukaryotic cells, which use them either to swim or to sweep fluid over 
their surface. The core of a eukaryotic cilium or flagellum consists of a 
highly  organized  and  stable  bundle  of  microtubules.  (Bacterial  flagella 
have an entirely different structure and allow the cells to swim by a very 
different mechanism.)

Figure 17–9 Defects in a nuclear lamin 
can cause a rare class of premature aging 
disorders called progeria. children with 
progeria begin to show advanced features 
of aging around 18 to 24 months of age.

In this section, we first consider the structure and assembly of microtu-
bules. We then discuss their role in organizing the cytoplasm—an ability 
that depends on their association with accessory proteins, especially the 
motor  proteins  that  propel  organelles  along  cytoskeletal  tracks.  Finally, 
we discuss the structure and function of cilia and flagella, in which micro-
tubules are stably associated with motor proteins that power the beating 
of these mobile appendages.

microtubules are Hollow tubes with structurally distinct 
ends
Microtubules  are  built  from  subunits—molecules  of  tubulin—each  of 
which is itself a dimer composed of two very similar globular proteins 
called  α-tubulin  and  β-tubulin,  bound  tightly  together  by  noncovalent 
interactions.  The  tubulin  dimers  stack  together,  again  by  noncovalent 
bonding,  to  form  the  wall  of  the  hollow  cylindrical  microtubule.  This 
tubelike  structure  is  made  of  13  parallel  protofilaments,  each  a  lin-
ear  chain  of  tubulin  dimers  with α-  and β-tubulin  alternating  along  its 
length  (Figure  17–11).  Each  protofilament  has  a  structural  polarity,

with α-tubulin exposed at one end and β-tubulin at the other, and this 
polarity—the directional arrow embodied in the structure—is the same 
for all the protofilaments, giving a structural polarity to the microtubule 
as a whole. One end of the microtubule, thought to be the β-tubulin end, 
is called its plus end, and the other, the α-tubulin end, its minus end.
In a concentrated solution of pure tubulin in a test tube, tubulin dimers 
will add to either end of a growing microtubule. However, they add more 
rapidly to the plus end than to the minus end, which is why the ends were 
originally  named  this  way—not  because  they  are  electrically  charged. 
The polarity of the microtubule—the fact that its structure has a definite 
direction, with the two ends being chemically and functionally distinct—
is crucial, both for the assembly of microtubules and for their role once 
they  are  formed.  If  microtubules  had  no  polarity,  they  could  not  guide 
intracellular transport, for example.

ECB4 e17.10/17.12

the centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing 
center in animal cells
Inside cells, microtubules grow from specialized organizing centers that 
control  the  location,  number,  and  orientation  of  the  microtubules.  In 
animal cells, for example, the centrosome—which is typically close to 
the  cell  nucleus  when  the  cell  is  not  in  mitosis—organizes  an  array  of 
microtubules  that  radiates  outward  through  the  cytoplasm  (see  Figure 
17–10B). The centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles, surrounded by 
a matrix of proteins. The centrosome matrix includes hundreds of ring-
shaped structures formed from a special type of tubulin, called γ-tubulin, 
and each γ-tubulin ring complex serves as the starting point, or nucleation 
site, for the growth of one microtubule (Figure 17–12a). The αβ-tubulin 
dimers add to each γ-tubulin ring complex in a specific orientation, with 
the  result  that  the  minus  end  of  each  microtubule  is  embedded  in  the 
centrosome, and growth occurs only at the plus end that extends into the 
cytoplasm (Figure 17–12B and C).

The  paired  centrioles  at  the  center  of  an  animal  cell  centrosome  are 
curious structures; each centriole, sitting perpendicular to its partner, is 
made of a cylindrical array of short microtubules. Yet centrioles have no 
role in the nucleation of microtubules from the centrosome (the γ-tubulin 
ring complex alone is sufficient), and their function remains something of 
a mystery, especially as plant cells lack them. Centrioles do, however, act 
as the organizing centers for the microtubules in cilia and flagella, where 
they are called basal bodies (see Figure 17–10D), as we discuss later.

ChapTEr 17     cytoskeleton

Figure 17–13 Each microtubule grows and 
shrinks independently of its neighbors. 
the array of microtubules anchored in a 
centrosome is continually changing, as new 
microtubules grow (red arrows) and old 
microtubules shrink (blue arrows). 

ECB4 E17.11/17.13

Figure 17–14 The selective stabilization 
of microtubules can polarize a cell. 
a newly formed microtubule will persist 
only if both its ends are protected from 
depolymerization. In cells, the minus ends 
of microtubules are generally protected 
by the organizing centers from which 
the microtubules grow. the plus ends 
are initially free but can be stabilized by 
binding to specific proteins. here, for 
example, a nonpolarized cell is depicted 
in (a), with new microtubules growing from 
a centrosome in many directions before 
shrinking back randomly. If a plus end 
happens to encounter a protein (capping 
protein) in a specific region of the cell 
cortex, it will be stabilized (B). Selective 
stabilization at one end of the cell will bias 
the orientation of the microtubule array 
(c) and, ultimately, will convert the cell to a 
strongly polarized form (D).

Why do microtubules need nucleating sites such as those provided by the 
γ-tubulin rings in the centrosome? The answer is that it is much harder 
to  start  a  new  microtubule  from  scratch,  by  first  assembling  a  ring  of 
αβ-tubulin dimers, than it is to add such dimers to a preexisting γ-tubulin 
ring complex. Although purified αβ-tubulin dimers at a high concentra-
tion can polymerize into microtubules spontaneously in vitro, in a living 
cell, the concentration of free αβ-tubulin is too low to drive the difficult 
first step of assembling the initial ring of a new microtubule. By providing 
organizing centers at specific sites, and keeping the concentration of free 
αβ-tubulin dimers low, cells can control where microtubules form.

Growing microtubules display dynamic instability
Once a microtubule has been nucleated, it typically grows outward from 
the  organizing  center  for  many  minutes  by  the  addition  of  αβ-tubulin 
dimers to its plus end. Then, without warning, the microtubule can sud-
denly  undergo  a  transition  that  causes  it  to  shrink  rapidly  inward  by 
losing tubulin dimers from its free plus end (Movie 17.2). It may shrink 
partially and then, no less suddenly, start growing again, or it may disap-
pear completely, to be replaced by a new microtubule that grows from 
the same γ-tubulin ring complex (Figure 17–13). 
This  remarkable  behavior—switching  back  and  forth  between  polym-
erization  and  depolymerization—is  known  as  dynamic  instability.  It 
allows microtubules to undergo rapid remodeling, and is crucial for their 
function. In a normal cell, the centrosome (or other organizing center) is 
continually shooting out new microtubules in different directions in an 
exploratory fashion, many of which then retract. A microtubule growing 
out from the centrosome can, however, be prevented from disassembling 
if  its  plus  end  is  stabilized  by  attachment  to  another  molecule  or  cell 
structure  so  as  to  prevent  its  depolymerization.  If  stabilized  by  attach-
ment to a structure in a more distant region of the cell, the microtubule 
will establish a relatively stable link between that structure and the cen-
trosome (Figure 17–14). The centrosome can be compared to a fisherman 
casting a line: if there is no bite at the end of the line, the line is quickly 
withdrawn, and a new cast is made; but, if a fish bites, the line remains in 
place, tethering the fish to the fisherman. This simple strategy of random 
exploration and selective stabilization enables the centrosome and other 
nucleating centers to set up a highly organized system of microtubules in 
selected parts of the cell. The same strategy is used to position organelles 
relative to one another.

dynamic instability is driven by GtP Hydrolysis
The dynamic instability of microtubules stems from the intrinsic capac-
ity of tubulin dimers to hydrolyze GTP. Each free tubulin dimer contains 
one  GTP  molecule  tightly  bound  to  β-tubulin,  which  hydrolyzes  the 
GTP to GDP shortly after the dimer is added to a growing microtubule. 
This GDP remains tightly bound to the β-tubulin. When polymerization

Figure 17–15 GTp hydrolysis controls the dynamic instability of 
microtubules. (a) tubulin dimers carrying Gtp (red ) bind more tightly 
to one another than do tubulin dimers carrying GDp (dark green). 
therefore, rapidly growing plus ends of microtubules, which have 
freshly added tubulin dimers with Gtp bound, tend to keep growing. 
(B) From time to time, however, especially if microtubule growth is 
slow, the dimers in this Gtp cap will hydrolyze their Gtp to GDp 
before fresh dimers loaded with Gtp have time to bind. the Gtp 
cap is thereby lost. Because the GDp-carrying dimers are less tightly 
bound in the polymer, the protofilaments peel away from the plus end, 
and the dimers are released, causing the microtubule to shrink (movie 
17.3). 

is proceeding rapidly, tubulin dimers add to the end of the microtubule 
faster  than  the  GTP  they  carry  is  hydrolyzed.  As  a  result,  the  end  of  a 
rapidly growing microtubule is composed entirely of GTP-tubulin dimers, 
which form a “GTP cap.” GTP-associated dimers bind more strongly to 
their  neighbors  in  the  microtubule  than  do  dimers  that  bear  GDP,  and 
they pack together more efficiently. Thus the microtubule will continue to 
grow (Figure 17–15a). 

Because of the randomness of chemical processes, however, it will occa-
sionally happen that the tubulin dimers at the free end of the microtubule 
will  hydrolyze  their  GTP  before  the  next  dimers  are  added,  so  that  the 
free  ends  of  protofilaments  are  now  composed  of  GDP-tubulin.  These 
GDP-bearing dimers associate less tightly, tipping the balance in favor of 
disassembly (Figure 17–15B). Because the rest of the microtubule is com-
posed of GDP-tubulin, once depolymerization has started, it will tend to 
continue; the microtubule starts to shrink rapidly and continuously and 
may even disappear. 

The GDP-tubulin that is freed as the microtubule depolymerizes joins the 
pool of unpolymerized tubulin already in the cytosol. In a typical fibro-
blast, for example, at any one time about half of the tubulin in the cell is in 
microtubules, while the remainder is free in the cytosol, forming a pool of 
tubulin dimers available for microtubule growth. The tubulin dimers join-
ing the pool rapidly exchange their bound GDP for GTP, thereby becoming 
competent again to add to another microtubule that is in a growth phase.

microtubule dynamics can be modified by drugs
Drugs  that  prevent  the  polymerization  or  depolymerization  of  tubulin 
dimers can have a rapid and profound effect on the organization of micro-
tubules—and  thereby  on  the  behavior  of  the  cell.  Consider  the  mitotic 
spindle, the microtubule-based apparatus that guides the chromosomes 
during mitosis (see Figure 17–10C). If a cell in mitosis is exposed to the 
drug colchicine, which binds tightly to free tubulin dimers and prevents 
their polymerization into microtubules, the mitotic spindle rapidly disap-
pears, and the cell stalls in the middle of mitosis, unable to partition the 
chromosomes into two groups. This finding, and others like it, demon-
strates that the mitotic spindle is normally maintained by a continuous 
balanced addition and loss of tubulin subunits: when tubulin addition is 
blocked by colchicine, tubulin loss continues until the spindle disappears. 
The drug Taxol has the opposite effect. It binds tightly to microtubules and 
prevents them from losing subunits. Because new subunits can still be 
added, the microtubules can grow but cannot shrink. However, despite 
this difference in their mechanism of action, Taxol has the same overall 
effect  as  colchicine—arresting  dividing  cells  in  mitosis.  These  experi-
ments show that for the mitotic spindle to function, microtubules must be 
able to assemble and disassemble. We discuss the behavior of the spindle 
in more detail in Chapter 18, when we consider mitosis.

The  inactivation  or  destruction  of  the  mitotic  spindle  eventually  kills 
dividing cells. Because cancer cells divide in a less controlled way than 
do normal cells of the body, they can sometimes be killed preferentially 
by microtubule-stabilizing or microtubule-destabilizing antimitotic drugs. 
These  drugs  include  colchicine,  Taxol,  vincristine,  and  vinblastine—all 
of  which  are  used  in  the  treatment  of  human  cancer  (Table  17–1).  As 
we discuss shortly, there are also drugs that stabilize or destabilize actin 
filaments. 

microtubules organize the cell interior 
Cells  are  able  to  modify  the  dynamic  instability  of  their  microtubules 
for  particular  purposes.  As  cells  enter  mitosis,  for  example,  microtu-
bules  become  initially  more  dynamic,  switching  between  growing  and 
shrinking much more frequently than cytoplasmic microtubules normally 
do. This change enables microtubules to disassemble rapidly and then 
reassemble into the mitotic spindle. On the other hand, when a cell has 
differentiated  into  a  specialized  cell  type,  the  dynamic  instability  of  its 
microtubules is often suppressed by proteins that bind to either the ends 
or the sides of the microtubules and stabilize them against disassembly. 
The stabilized microtubules then serve to maintain the organization of 
the differentiated cell.

Most differentiated animal cells are polarized; that is, one end of the cell 
is  structurally  or  functionally  different  from  the  other.  Nerve  cells,  for 
example, put out an axon from one end of the cell and dendrites from 
the  other  (see  Figure  12–29).  Cells  specialized  for  secretion  have  their 
Golgi apparatus positioned toward the site of secretion, and so on. The 
cell’s polarity is a reflection of the polarized systems of microtubules in 
its interior, which help to position organelles in their required location 
within the cell and to guide the streams of vesicular and macromolecular 
traffic moving between one part of the cell and another. In the nerve cell, 
for  example,  all  the  microtubules  in  the  axon  point  in  the  same  direc-
tion, with their plus ends toward the axon terminals; along these oriented 
tracks, the cell is able to transport organelles, membrane vesicles, and 
macromolecules—either from the cell body to the axon terminals or in 
the opposite direction (Figure 17–16).

Question 17–3

dynamic instability causes 
microtubules either to grow or to 
shrink rapidly. consider an individual 
microtubule that is in its shrinking 
phase. 
a.   What must happen at the end 
of the microtubule in order for it to 
stop shrinking and to start growing 
again? 
b.   How would a change in the 
tubulin concentration affect this 
switch? 
c.   What would happen if only GdP, 
but no GtP, were present in the 
solution? 
d.  What would happen if the 
solution contained an analog of GtP 
that cannot be hydrolyzed?

Some of the traffic along axons travels at speeds in excess of 10 cm a day 
(Figure 17–17), which means that it could still take a week or more for 
materials to reach the end of a long axon in larger animals. Nonetheless, 
movement  guided  by  microtubules  is  immeasurably  faster  and  more 
efficient than movement driven by free diffusion. A protein molecule trav-
eling by free diffusion could take years to reach the end of a long axon—if 
it arrived at all (see Question 17–12).

ECB4 e17.15/17.17

The microtubules in living cells do not act alone. Their activity, like those 
of other cytoskeletal filaments, depends on a large variety of accessory 
proteins  that  bind  to  them.  Some  of  these  microtubule-associated 
proteins stabilize microtubules against disassembly, for example, while 
others  link  microtubules  to  other  cell  components,  including  the  other 
types  of  cytoskeletal  filaments  (see  Figure  17–7).  Still  others  are  motor 
proteins that actively transport organelles, vesicles, and other macromol-
ecules along microtubules. 

motor Proteins drive intracellular transport
If  a  living  cell  is  observed  in  a  light  microscope,  its  cytoplasm  is  seen 
to  be  in  continual  motion.  Mitochondria  and  the  smaller  membrane-
enclosed organelles and vesicles travel in small, jerky steps—moving for 
a  short  period,  stopping,  and  then  moving  again.  This  saltatory  move-
ment is much more sustained and directional than the continual, small, 
Brownian  movements  caused  by  random  thermal  motions.  Saltatory 
movements  can  occur  along  either  microtubules  or  actin  filaments.  In 
both cases, the movements are driven by motor proteins, which use the 
energy derived from repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis to travel steadily 
along the microtubule or actin filament in a single direction (see Figure 
4–46). Because the motor proteins also attach to other cell components, 
they can transport this cargo along the filaments. There are dozens of dif-
ferent motor proteins; they differ in the type of filament they bind to, the 
direction in which they move along the filament, and the cargo they carry.

The motor proteins that move along cytoplasmic microtubules, such as 
those in the axon of a nerve cell, belong to two families: the kinesins gen-
erally move toward the plus end of a microtubule (outward from the cell 
body in Figure 17–16); the dyneins move toward the minus end (toward 
the cell body in Figure 17–16). Both kinesins and dyneins are generally 

578 

ChapTEr 17     cytoskeleton

Figure 17–18 Both kinesins and 
dyneins move along microtubules using 
their globular heads. (a) Kinesins and 
cytoplasmic dyneins are microtubule motor 
proteins that generally move in opposite 
directions along a microtubule. each of 
these proteins (drawn here roughly to

subunits. each dimer has two globular

dimers that have two globular ATP-binding heads and a single tail (Figure 
17–18a). The heads interact with microtubules in a stereospecific man-
ner, so that the motor protein will attach to a microtubule in only one 
direction. The tail of a motor protein generally binds stably to some cell 
component, such as a vesicle or an organelle, and thereby determines 
the type of cargo that the motor protein can transport (Figure 17–19). The 
globular heads of kinesin and dynein are enzymes with ATP-hydrolyzing 
(ATPase) activity. This reaction provides the energy for driving a directed 
series  of  conformational  changes  in  the  head  that  enable  it  to  move 
along the microtubule by a cycle of binding, release, and rebinding to the 
microtubule (see Figure 17–18B and Figure 4–46). For a discussion of the 
discovery and study of motor proteins, see how We Know, pp. 580–581.

microtubules and motor Proteins Position organelles in 
the cytoplasm
Microtubules  and  motor  proteins  play  an  important  part  in  positioning 
organelles within a eukaryotic cell. In most animal cells, for example, the 
tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reach almost to the edge of 
the cell (Movie 17.4), whereas the Golgi apparatus is located in the cell 
interior, near the centrosome (Figure 17–20a). The ER extends out from 
its points of connection with the nuclear envelope along microtubules, 
which  reach  from  the  centrally  located  centrosome  out  to  the  plasma 
membrane. As a cell grows, kinesins attached to the outside of the ER 
membrane (via receptor proteins) pull the ER outward along microtubules, 
stretching it like a net (Figure 17–20B). Cytoplasmic dyneins attached to 

Figure 17–19 Different motor proteins 
transport different types of cargo along 
microtubules. Most kinesins move toward 
the plus end of a microtubule, whereas 
dyneins move toward the minus end 
(movie 17.5). Both types of microtubule 
motor proteins exist in many forms, each 
of which is thought to transport a different 
type of cargo. the tail of the motor 
protein determines what cargo the protein 
transports.

the Golgi membranes pull the Golgi apparatus along microtubules in the 
opposite  direction,  inward  toward  the  nucleus  (Figure  17–20C).  In  this 
way,  the  regional  differences  in  these  internal  membranes—crucial  for 
their respective functions—are created and maintained.

ECB4 E17.18/17.20

When cells are treated with colchicine—a drug that causes microtubules 
to disassemble—both the ER and the Golgi apparatus change their loca-
tion dramatically. The ER, which is connected to the nuclear envelope, 
collapses around the nucleus; the Golgi apparatus, which is not attached 
to any other organelle, fragments into small vesicles, which then disperse 
throughout the cytoplasm. When the colchicine is removed, the organ-
elles return to their original positions, dragged by motor proteins moving 
along the re-formed microtubules. 

cilia and flagella contain stable microtubules moved by 
dynein
We  mentioned  earlier  that  many  microtubules  in  cells  are  stabilized 
through their association with other proteins and therefore do not show 
dynamic instability. Cells use such stable microtubules as stiff supports in 
the construction of a variety of polarized structures, including motile cilia 
and flagella. Cilia are hairlike structures about 0.25 μm in diameter, cov-
ered by plasma membrane, that extend from the surface of many kinds 
of eukaryotic cells; each cilium contains a core of stable microtubules, 
arranged  in  a  bundle,  that  grow  from  a  cytoplasmic  basal  body,  which 
serves as an organizing center (see Figure 17–10D).

Cilia beat in a whiplike fashion, either to move fluid over the surface of a 
cell or to propel single cells through a fluid. Some protozoa, for example,

The  movement  of  organelles  throughout  the  cell  cyto-
plasm  has  been  observed,  measured,  and  speculated 
about since the middle of the nineteenth century. But it 
was not until the mid-1980s that biologists identified the 
molecules  that  drive  this  movement  of  organelles  and 
vesicles from one part of the cell to another. 

Why  the  lag  between  observation  and  understanding? 
The  problem  was  in  the  proteins—or,  more  precisely, 
in the difficulty of studying them in isolation outside the 
cell. To investigate the activity of an enzyme, for exam-
ple,  biochemists  first  purify  the  polypeptide:  they  break 
open cells or tissues and separate the protein of interest 
from other molecular components (see Panels 4–4 and 
4–5, pp. 166–167). They can then study the protein in a 
test tube (in vitro), controlling its exposure to substrates, 
inhibitors, ATP, and so on. Unfortunately, this approach 
did not seem to work for studies of the motile machinery 
that underlies intracellular transport. It is not possible to 
break open a cell and pull out an intact, fully active trans-
port system, free of extraneous material, that continues 
to carry mitochondria and vesicles from place to place.

That  problem  was  solved  by  technical  advances  in 
two separate fields. First, improvements in microscopy 
allowed biologists to see that an operational transport 
system (with extraneous material still attached) could be 
squeezed from the right kind of living cell. At the same 
time,  biochemists  realized  that  they  could  assemble  a 
working  transport  system  from  scratch—using  purified 
cytoskeletal  filaments,  motors,  and  cargo—outside  the 
cell. One such breakthrough started with a squid.

teeming cytoplasm
Neuroscientists interested in the electrical properties of 
nerve cell membranes have long studied the giant axon 
from squid (see How We Know, pp. 406–407). Because of 
its large size, researchers found that they could squeeze 
the cytoplasm from the axon like toothpaste, and then 
study  how  ions  move  back  and  forth  through  various 
channels in the empty, tubelike plasma membrane (see 
Figure  12–33).  The  physiologists  simply  discarded  the 
cytoplasmic  jelly,  as  it  appeared  to  be  inert  (and  thus 
uninteresting)  when  examined  under  a  standard  light 
microscope. 

Then along came video-enhanced microscopy. This type 
of microscopy, developed by Shinya Inoué, Robert Allen, 
and others, allows one to detect structures that are smaller 
than the resolving power of standard light microscopes, 
which is only about 0.2 μm, or 200 nm (see Panel 1–1, 
pp. 10–11). Sample images are captured by a video cam-
era and then enhanced by computer processing to reduce 
the background and heighten contrast. When research-
ers  in  the  early  1980s  applied  this  new  technique  to 

preparations of squid axon cytoplasm (axoplasm), they 
observed, for the first time, the motion of vesicles and 
other organelles along cytoskeletal filaments.

Under  the  video-enhanced  microscope,  extruded  axo-
plasm  is  seen  to  be  teeming  with  tiny  particles—from 
vesicles  30–50  nm  in  diameter  to  mitochondria  some 
5000 nm long, all moving to and fro along cytoskeletal 
filaments at speeds of up to 5 μm per second. If the axo-
plasm is spread thinly enough, individual filaments can 
be seen. 

The movement continues for hours, allowing research-
ers to manipulate the preparation and study the effects. 
Ray Lasek and Scott Brady discovered, for example, that 
the  organelle  movement  requires  ATP.  Substitution  of 
ATP  analogs,  such  as  AMP-PNP,  which  resemble  ATP 
but cannot be hydrolyzed (and thus provide no energy), 
inhibit the translocation.

snaking tubes
More work was needed to identify the individual compo-
nents that drive the transport system in squid axoplasm. 
What  kind  of  filaments  support  this  movement?  What 
are the molecular motors that shuttle the vesicles and 
organelles  along  these  filaments?  Identifying  the  fila-
ments was relatively easy: antibodies to tubulin revealed 
that  they  are  microtubules.  But  what  about  the  motor 
proteins?  To  find  these,  Ron  Vale,  Thomas  Reese,  and 
Michael Sheetz set up a system in which they could fish 
for proteins that power organelle movement.

Their  strategy  was  simple  yet  elegant:  add  together 
microtubules and organelles and then look for molecules 
that  induce  motion.  They  used  purified  microtubules 
from squid brain, added organelles isolated from squid 
axons, and showed that organelle movement could be 
triggered by the addition of an extract from squid axo-
plasm. In this preparation, the researchers could either 
watch  the  organelles  travel  along  the  microtubules  or 
watch the microtubules glide snakelike over the surface 
of a glass coverslip that had been coated with an axo-
plasm extract (see Question 17–18). Their challenge was 
to isolate the protein responsible for movement in this 
reconstituted system. 

To  do  that,  Vale  and  his  colleagues  took  advantage 
of  the  earlier  work  with  the  ATP  analog  AMP-PNP. 
Although this analog inhibits the movement of vesicles 
along microtubules, it still allows organelles to attach to 
the microtubule filaments. So the researchers incubated 
the axoplasm extract with microtubules and organelles 
in  the  presence  of  AMP-PNP;  they  then  pulled  out  the 
microtubules with what they hoped were the motor pro-
teins still attached. Vale and his team then added ATP to

in vitro motility assay, purified kinesin is mixed with microtubules 
in the presence of atp. When a drop of the mixture is placed 
on a glass slide and examined by video-enhanced microscopy, 
individual microtubules can be seen gliding over the slide. they 
are driven by kinesin molecules, which attach to the glass slide 
by their tails. Images were recorded at 1-second intervals. the

release the attached proteins, and they found a 110-kilo-
dalton  polypeptide  that  could  stimulate  the  gliding  of 
microtubules  along  a  glass  coverslip  (Figure  17–21). 
They dubbed the molecule kinesin (from the Greek kin-
ein, “to move”). 

ECB4 e17.20/17.21

Similar in vitro motility assays have been instrumental 
in the study of other motor proteins—such as myosins, 
which move along actin filaments, as we discuss later. 
Subsequent  studies  showed  that  kinesin  moves  along 
microtubules from the minus end to the plus end; they 
also identified many other motor proteins of the kinesin 
family.

lights, camera, action
Combining  such  assays  with  ever  more  refined  micro-
scopic  techniques,  researchers  can  now  monitor  the 
movement  of  individual  motor  proteins  along  single 
microtubules, even in living cells. 

Observation  of  kinesin  molecules  coupled  with  green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that this motor pro-
tein marches along microtubules processively—that is, 
each molecule takes multiple “steps” along the filament 
(100 or so) before falling off. The length of each step is 
8  nm,  which  corresponds  to  the  spacing  of  individual 
tubulin dimers along the microtubule. Combining these 
observations with assays of ATP hydrolysis, researchers 
have confirmed that one molecule of ATP is hydrolyzed 
per  step.  Kinesin  can  move  in  a  processive  manner 
because it has two heads. This enables it to walk toward 
the plus end of the microtubule in a “hand-over-hand” 
fashion, each head repetitively binding and releasing the 
filament as it swings past the bound head in front (Figure 
17–22).  Such  studies  now  allow  us  to  follow  the  foot-
steps of these fascinating and industrious proteins—step 
by molecular step.

use cilia to collect food particles, and others use them for locomotion. 
On the epithelial cells lining the human respiratory tract (Figure 17–23), 
huge numbers of beating cilia (more than a billion per square centimeter) 
sweep layers of mucus containing trapped dust particles and dead cells 
up toward the throat, to be swallowed and eventually eliminated from 
the body. Similarly, beating cilia on the cells of the oviduct wall create 
a current that helps to carry eggs along the oviduct. Each cilium acts as 
a small oar, moving in a repeated cycle that generates the movement of 
fluid over the cell surface (Figure 17–24). 

The flagella (singular flagellum) that propel sperm and many protozoa 
are much like cilia in their internal structure but are usually very much 
longer.  They  are  designed  to  move  the  entire  cell,  rather  than  moving 
fluid across the cell surface. Flagella propagate regular waves along their 
length, propelling the attached cell along (Figure 17–25). 

The microtubules in cilia and flagella are slightly different from cytoplas-
mic microtubules; they are arranged in a curious and distinctive pattern, 
which was one of the most striking revelations of early electron micros-
copy. A cross section through a cilium shows nine doublet microtubules 
arranged in a ring around a pair of single microtubules (Figure 17–26a). 
This “9 + 2” array is characteristic of almost all eukaryotic cilia and fla-
gella—from those of protozoa to those in humans. 

The movement of a cilium or a flagellum is produced by the bending of 
its core as the microtubules slide against each other. The microtubules 
are associated with numerous accessory proteins (Figure 17–26B), which 
project at regular positions along the length of the microtubule bundle. 
Some of these proteins serve as cross-links to hold the bundle of microtu-
bules together; others generate the force that causes the cilium to bend. 

The most important of the accessory proteins is the motor protein cili-
ary  dynein,  which  generates  the  bending  motion  of  the  core.  It  closely 

Figure 17–24 a cilium beats by performing a repetitive cycle of 
movements, consisting of a power stroke followed by a recovery 
stroke. In the fast power stroke, the cilium is fully extended and fluid 
is driven over the surface of the cell; in the slower recovery stroke, 
the cilium curls back into position with minimal disturbance to the 
surrounding fluid. each cycle typically requires 0.1–0.2 second and 
generates a force parallel to the cell surface.

resembles  cytoplasmic  dynein  and  functions  in  much  the  same  way. 
Ciliary  dynein  is  attached  by  its  tail  to  one  microtubule,  while  its  two 
heads interact with an adjacent microtubule to generate a sliding force 
between the two microtubules. Because of the multiple links that hold the 
adjacent microtubule doublets together, the sliding force between adja-
cent microtubules is converted to a bending motion in the cilium (Figure 
17–27). In humans, hereditary defects in ciliary dynein cause Kartagener’s 
syndrome. Men with this disorder are infertile because their sperm are 
nonmotile, and they have an increased susceptibility to bronchial infec-
tions because the cilia that line their respiratory tract are paralyzed and 
thus unable to clear bacteria and debris from the lungs.

Many animal cells that lack beating cilia contain a single, nonmotile pri-
mary cilium. This appendage is much shorter than a beating cilium and 
functions as an antenna for sensing certain extracellular signal molecules.

actin filaments
Actin filaments, polymers of the protein actin, are present in all eukary-
otic cells and are essential for many of the cell’s movements, especially 
those involving the cell surface. Without actin filaments, for example, an 
animal  cell  could  not  crawl  along  a  surface,  engulf  a  large  particle  by 
phagocytosis, or divide in two. Like microtubules, many actin filaments 
are unstable, but by associating with other proteins they can also form 
stable structures in cells, such as the contractile apparatus of muscle cells. 
Actin filaments interact with a large number of actin-binding proteins that 
enable the filaments to serve a variety of functions in cells. Depending on 
which of these proteins they associate with, actin filaments can form stiff 
and stable structures, such as the microvilli on the epithelial cells lining

the  intestine  (Figure  17–28a)  or  the  small  contractile  bundles  that  can 
contract and act like tiny muscles in most animal cells (Figure 17–28B). 
They  can  also  form  temporary  structures,  such  as  the  dynamic  protru-
sions formed at the leading edge of a crawling cell (Figure 17–28C) or 
the contractile ring that pinches the cytoplasm in two when an animal cell 
divides  (Figure  17–28D).  Actin-dependent  movements  usually  require 
actin’s association with a motor protein called myosin. 

In this section, we see how the arrangements of actin filaments in a cell 
depend on the types of actin-binding proteins present. Even though actin 
filaments and microtubules are formed from unrelated types of subunit 
proteins, we will see that the principles by which they assemble and dis-
assemble, control cell structure, and work with motor proteins to bring 
about movement are strikingly similar.

actin filaments are thin and flexible
Actin  filaments  appear  in  electron  micrographs  as  threads  about  7  nm 
in diameter. Each filament is a twisted chain of identical globular actin 
monomers, all of which “point” in the same direction along the axis of 
the chain. Like a microtubule, therefore, an actin filament has a structural 
polarity, with a plus end and a minus end (Figure 17–29).

Actin filaments are thinner, more flexible, and usually shorter than micro-
tubules. There are, however, many more of them, so that the total length 
of all the actin filaments in a cell is generally many times greater than the 
total length of all of the microtubules. Unlike intermediate filaments and

actin and tubulin Polymerize by similar mechanisms
Although actin filaments can grow by the addition of actin monomers at 
either end, like microtubules, their rate of growth is faster at the plus end 
than at the minus end. A naked actin filament, like a microtubule with-
out  associated  proteins,  is  inherently  unstable,  and  it  can  disassemble 
from both ends. In living cells, free actin monomers carry a tightly bound 
nucleoside triphosphate, in this case ATP. The actin monomer hydrolyzes 
its bound ATP to ADP soon after it is incorporated into the filament. As 
with the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP in a microtubule, hydrolysis of ATP to 
ADP  in  an  actin  filament  reduces  the  strength  of  binding  between  the 
monomers, thereby decreasing the stability of the polymer. Thus in both 
cases,  nucleotide  hydrolysis  promotes  depolymerization,  helping  the 
cell to disassemble its microtubules and actin filaments after they have 
formed.

If  the  concentration  of  free  actin  monomers  is  very  high,  an  actin  fila-
ment will grow rapidly, adding monomers at both ends. At intermediate 
concentrations of free actin, however, something interesting takes place. 
Actin monomers add to the plus end at a rate faster than the bound ATP 
can be hydrolyzed, so the plus end grows. At the minus end, by contrast, 
ATP  is  hydrolyzed  faster  than  new  monomers  can  be  added;  because 
ADP-actin  destabilizes  the  structure,  the  filament  loses  subunits  from 
its minus end at the same time as it adds them to the plus end (Figure 
17–30). Inasmuch as an individual monomer moves through the filament 
from the plus to the minus end, this behavior is called treadmilling. 

Both  the  treadmilling  of  actin  filaments  and  the  dynamic  instability  of 
microtubules rely on the hydrolysis of a bound nucleoside triphosphate 
to regulate the length of the polymer. But the result is usually different.

monomer that carries them dissociates from 
the filament.

Treadmilling involves a simultaneous gain of monomers at the plus end 
of an actin filament and loss at the minus end: when the rates of addition 
and loss are equal, the filament remains the same size (Figure 17–31a). 
Dynamic  instability,  on  the  other  hand,  involves  a  rapid  switch  from 
growth to shrinkage (or from shrinkage to growth) at only the plus end of 
the microtubule. As a result, microtubules tend to undergo more drastic 
changes in length than do actin filaments—either growing rapidly or col-
lapsing rapidly (Figure 17–31B).

Actin filament function can be perturbed experimentally by certain toxins 
produced  by  fungi  or  marine  sponges.  Some,  such  as  cytochalasin  and 
latrunculin, prevent actin polymerization; others, such as phalloidin, sta-
bilize actin filaments against depolymerization (Table 17–2). Addition of 
these toxins to the medium bathing cells or tissues, even in low concen-
trations, instantaneously freezes cell movements such as cell locomotion. 
Thus  as  with  microtubules,  many  of  the  functions  of  actin  filaments 
depend on the ability of the filament to assemble and disassemble, the 
rates of which depend on the dynamic equilibrium between the actin fila-
ments, the pool of actin monomers, and various actin-binding proteins. 

many Proteins bind to actin and modify its Properties
About 5% of the total protein in a typical animal cell is actin; about half of 
this actin is assembled into filaments, and the other half remains as actin 
monomers  in  the  cytosol.  Thus  unlike  the  situation  for  tubulin  dimers, 
the  concentration  of  actin  monomers  is  high—much  higher  than  the 
concentration required for purified actin monomers to polymerize spon-
taneously in a test tube. What, then, keeps the actin monomers in cells 
from polymerizing totally into filaments? The answer is that cells contain

Question 17–5

the formation of actin filaments in 
the cytosol is controlled by actin-
binding proteins. some actin-binding 
proteins significantly increase the 
rate at which the formation of an 
actin filament is initiated. suggest a 
mechanism by which they might do 
this.

Figure 17–31 Treadmilling of actin 
filaments and dynamic instability of 
microtubules regulate polymer length 
in different ways. (a) treadmilling occurs 
when atp-actin adds to the plus end of an 
actin filament at the same time that aDp-
actin is lost from the minus end. When the 
rates of addition and loss are equal, the 
filament stays the same length—although 
individual actin monomers (three of which 
are numbered) move through the filament 
from the plus to the minus end. (B) In 
dynamic instability, Gtp-tubulin adds to 
the plus end of a growing microtubule. 
as discussed earlier, when Gtp-tubulin 
addition is faster than Gtp hydrolysis, a 
Gtp cap forms at that end; when the rate 
of addition slows, the Gtp cap is lost, 
and the filament experiences catastrophic 
shrinkage via the loss of GDp-tubulin from 
the same end. the microtubule will shrink 
until the Gtp cap is regained—or until the 
microtubule disappears (see Figure 17–15).

small proteins, such as thymosin and profilin, that bind to actin monomers

By keeping actin monomers in reserve until they are required, these pro-
teins play a crucial role in regulating actin polymerization. When actin 
filaments are needed, other actin-binding proteins such as formins and 
actin-related proteins (ARPs) promote actin polymerization.

There are a great many actin-binding  proteins in cells. Most of these 
bind  to  assembled  actin  filaments  rather  than  to  actin  monomers  and 
control the behavior of the intact filaments (Figure 17–32). Actin-bundling 
proteins, for example, hold actin filaments together in parallel bundles in 
microvilli; others cross-link actin filaments together in a gel-like mesh-

cytoplasm  just  beneath  the  plasma  membrane.  Filament-severing  pro-
teins fragment actin filaments into shorter lengths and thus can convert 
an actin gel to a more fluid state. Actin filaments can also associate with 
myosin  motor  proteins  to  form  contractile  bundles,  as  in  muscle  cells. 
And they often form tracks along which myosin motor proteins transport 
organelles, a function that is especially conspicuous in plant cells.

In the remainder of this chapter, we consider some characteristic struc-
tures that actin filaments can form, and we discuss how different types 
of actin-binding proteins are involved in their assembly. We begin with 
the cell cortex and its role in cell locomotion, and we conclude with the 
contractile apparatus of muscle cells.

a cortex rich in actin filaments underlies the Plasma 
membrane of most eukaryotic cells
Although  actin  is  found  throughout  the  cytoplasm  of  a  eukaryotic  cell, 
in most cells it is highly concentrated in a layer just beneath the plasma 
membrane. In this region, called the cell cortex, actin filaments are linked 
by  actin-binding  proteins  into  a  meshwork  that  supports  the  plasma 
membrane and gives it mechanical strength. In human red blood cells, 
a  simple  and  regular  network  of  fibrous  proteins—including  actin  and 
spectrin filaments—attaches to the plasma membrane, providing the sup-
port necessary for the cells to maintain their simple discoid shape (see 
Figure 11–29). The cell cortex of other animal cells, however, is thicker 
and more complex, and it supports a far richer repertoire of cell shapes 
and  cell-surface  movements.  Like  the  cortex  in  the  red  blood  cell,  the 
cortex in other cells contains spectrin; however, it also includes a much 
denser network of actin filaments. These filaments become cross-linked 
into a three-dimensional meshwork, which governs cell shape and the 
mechanical properties of the plasma membrane: the rearrangements of 
actin filaments within the cortex provide much of the molecular basis for 
changes in both cell shape and cell locomotion.

cell crawling depends on cortical actin
Many  eukaryotic  cells  move  by  crawling  over  surfaces,  rather  than  by 
swimming  by  means  of  beating  cilia  or  flagella.  Carnivorous  amoebae 
crawl continually, in search of food. The advancing tip of a developing 
axon migrates in response to growth factors, following a path of chemi-
cal signals to its eventual synaptic target cells. White blood cells known 
as neutrophils migrate out of the blood into infected tissues when they 
“smell” small molecules released by bacteria, which the neutrophils seek 
out and destroy. For these hunters, such chemotactic molecules binding 
to receptors on the cell surface trigger changes in actin filament assembly 
that help direct the cells toward their prey (see Movie 17.7). 

The  molecular  mechanisms  of  these  and  other  forms  of  cell  crawling 
entail coordinated changes of many molecules in different regions of the 
cell,  and  no  single,  easily  identifiable  locomotory  organelle,  such  as  a 
flagellum, is responsible. In broad terms, however, three interrelated pro-
cesses are known to be essential: (1) the cell pushes out protrusions at its 
“front,” or leading edge; (2) these protrusions adhere to the surface over 
which the cell is crawling; and (3) the rest of the cell drags itself forward 
by traction on these anchorage points (Figure 17–33).

All three processes involve actin, but in different ways. The first step, the 
pushing forward of the cell surface, is driven by actin polymerization. The 
leading  edge  of  a  crawling  fibroblast  in  culture  regularly  extends  thin, 
sheetlike  lamellipodia,  which  contain  a  dense  meshwork  of  actin  fila-
ments, oriented so that most of the filaments have their plus ends close

Figure 17–33 Forces generated in the 
actin-filament-rich cortex help move a 
cell forward. actin polymerization at the 
leading edge of the cell pushes the plasma 
membrane forward (protrusion) and forms 
new regions of actin cortex, shown here in 
red. New points of anchorage are made 
between the bottom of the cell and the 
surface (substratum) on which the cell is 
crawling (attachment). contraction at the 
rear of the cell—mediated by myosin motor 
proteins moving along actin filaments—then 
draws the body of the cell forward. New 
anchorage points are established at the 
front, and old ones are released at the back, 
as the cell crawls forward. the same cycle is 
repeated over and over again, moving the 
cell forward in a stepwise fashion. 

to the plasma membrane. Many cells also extend thin, stiff protrusions 
called filopodia, both at the leading edge and elsewhere on their surface 
(Figure 17–34). These are about 0.1 μm wide and 5–10 μm long, and each 
contains  a  loose  bundle  of  10–20  actin  filaments  (see  Figure  17–28C), 
again oriented with their plus ends pointing outward. The advancing tip 
(growth cone) of a developing nerve cell axon extends even longer filopo-
dia, up to 50 μm long, which help it to probe its environment and find the 
correct path to its target cell. Both lamellipodia and filopodia are explor-
atory, motile structures that form and retract with great speed, moving 
at  around  1  μm  per  second.  Both  are  thought  to  be  generated  by  the 
rapid local growth of actin filaments, which assemble close to the plasma 
membrane and elongate by the addition of actin monomers at their plus 
ends. In this way, the filaments push out the membrane without tearing it.

Figure 17–35 a web of polymerizing actin filaments pushes the leading edge of a lamellipodium forward. 
(a) a highly motile keratocyte from frog skin was fixed, dried, and shadowed with platinum, and examined in 
an electron microscope. actin filaments form a dense network, with the fast-growing plus ends of the filaments 
terminating at the leading margin of the lamellipodium (top of figure). (B) Drawing showing how the nucleation of 
new actin filaments (red ) is mediated by arp complexes (brown) attached to the sides of preexisting actin filaments. 
the resulting branching structure pushes the plasma membrane forward. the plus ends of the actin filaments 
become protected from depolymerizing by capping proteins (blue), while the minus ends of actin filaments nearer 
the center of the cell continually disassemble through the action of depolymerizing proteins (not shown). the web 
of actin as a whole thereby undergoes a continual rearward movement due to the assembly of filaments at the front 
and their disassembly at the rear. this actin network is drawn to a different scale than the network shown in (a).

ECB4 e17.34/17.36

The  formation  and  growth  of  actin  filaments  at  the  leading  edge  of  a 
cell are assisted by various actin-binding proteins. The actin-related pro-
teins—or  ARPs—mentioned  earlier  promote  the  formation  of  a  web  of 
branched actin filaments in lamellipodia. ARPs form complexes that bind 
to the sides of existing actin filaments and nucleate the formation of new 
filaments, which grow out at an angle to produce side branches. With the 
aid  of  additional  actin-binding  proteins,  this  web  undergoes  continual 
assembly at the leading edge and disassembly further back, pushing the 
lamellipodium forward (Figure 17–35). 

The other kind of cell protrusion, the filopodium, depends on formins, a 
nucleating  protein  that  attaches  to  the  growing  plus  ends  of  actin  fila-
ments  and  promotes  the  addition  of  new  monomers  to  form  straight, 
unbranched  filaments.  Formins  are  also  used  elsewhere  to  assemble 
unbranched filaments, as in the contractile ring that pinches a dividing 
animal cell in two. 

When the lamellipodia and filopodia touch down on a favorable surface, 
they stick: transmembrane proteins in their plasma membrane, known 
as integrins (discussed in Chapter 20), adhere to molecules either in the 
extracellular matrix or on the surface of a neighboring cell over which 
the moving cell is crawling. Meanwhile, on the intracellular face of the 
crawling cell’s plasma membrane, integrins capture actin filaments in the 
cortex,  thereby  creating  a  robust  anchorage  for  the  crawling  cell  (see 
Figures 17–33 and 20–15C). To use this anchorage to drag its body for-
ward,  the  cell  calls  on  the  help  of  myosin  motor  proteins,  as  we  now 
discuss.

Question 17–6

suppose that the actin molecules 
in a cultured skin cell have been 
randomly labeled in such a way 
that 1 in 10,000 molecules carries 
a fluorescent marker. What would 
you expect to see if you examined

of this cell through a fluorescence 
microscope? assume that your 
microscope is sensitive enough to 
detect single fluorescent molecules.

actin associates with myosin to form contractile 
structures
All  actin-dependent  motor  proteins  belong  to  the  myosin  family.  They 
bind to and hydrolyze ATP, which provides the energy for their movement 
along actin filaments toward the plus end. Myosin, along with actin, was 
first discovered in skeletal muscle, and much of what we know about the 
interaction  of  these  two  proteins  was  learned  from  studies  of  muscle. 
There are various types of myosins in cells, of which the myosin-I and 
myosin-II subfamilies are the most abundant. Myosin-I is present in all 
types of cells, whereas muscle cells make use of a specialized form of 
myosin-II.  Because  myosin-I  is  simpler  in  structure  and  mechanism  of 
action, we discuss it first.
Myosin-I molecules have a head domain and a tail (Figure 17–36a). The 
head  domain  binds  to  an  actin  filament  and  has  the  ATP-hydrolyzing 
motor activity that enables it to move along the filament in a repetitive 
cycle of binding, detachment, and rebinding (Movie 17.8). The tail varies 
among the different types of myosin-I and determines what type of cargo 
the myosin drags along. For example, the tail may bind to a particular 
type of vesicle and propel it through the cell along actin filament tracks 
(Figure 17–36B), or it may bind to the plasma membrane and pull it into 
a different shape (Figure 17–36C).

extracellular signals can alter the arrangement of  
actin filaments
We  have  seen  that  myosin  and  other  actin-binding  proteins  can  regu-
late the location, organization, and behavior of actin filaments. But the 
activities of these proteins are, in turn, controlled by extracellular signals, 
allowing the cell to rearrange its actin cytoskeleton in response to the 
environment.

The  extracellular  signal  molecules  that  regulate  the  actin  cytoskeleton 
activate a variety of cell-surface receptor proteins, which in turn activate 
various  intracellular  signaling  pathways.  These  pathways  often  con-
verge on a group of closely related monomeric GTPase proteins called the 
Rho  protein  family.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  16,  monomeric  GTPases 
behave  as  molecular  switches  that  control  intracellular  processes  by

organelle in the cell. (B) this arrangement 
allows the head domain to move a vesicle 
relative to an actin filament, which in this 
case is anchored to the plasma membrane. 
(c) Myosin-I can also bind to an actin 
filament in the cell cortex, ultimately pulling 
the plasma membrane into a new shape. 
Note that the head group always walks

GTpases can have a dramatic effect 
on the organization of actin filaments 
in fibroblasts. In these micrographs, 
actin is stained with fluorescently labeled

to actin filaments (see table 17–2, p. 587).

filaments primarily in the cortex.  
(B) Microinjection of an activated form

rho, causes the formation of an enormous 
lamellipodium that extends from the entire 
circumference of the cell. (D) Microinjection

family member, stimulates the protrusion of 
many long filopodia at the cell periphery.

Question 17–7

at the leading edge of a crawling 
cell, the plus ends of actin filaments 
are located close to the plasma 
membrane, and actin monomers 
are added at these ends, pushing 
the membrane outward to form 
lamellipodia or filopodia. What do 
you suppose holds the filaments at 
their other ends to prevent them 
from just being pushed into the 
cell’s interior?

cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound 
state (see Figure 16–15B). In the case of the actin cytoskeleton, activa-
tion of different members of the Rho family affects the organization of 
actin filaments in different ways. For example, activation of one Rho fam-
ily member triggers actin polymerization and filament bundling to form 
filopodia; activation of another promotes lamellipodia formation and ruf-
fling; and activation of Rho itself drives the bundling of actin filaments 
with myosin-II and the clustering of cell-surface integrins, thus promot-
ing cell crawling (Figure 17–37).

ECB4 e17.37/17.39

These dramatic and complex structural changes occur because the Rho 
family GTP-binding proteins, together with the protein kinases and acces-
sory proteins with which they interact, act like a computational network 
to control actin organization and dynamics. This network receives exter-
nal signals from nutrients, growth factors, and contacts with neighboring 
cells  and  the  extracellular  matrix,  along  with  intracellular  information 
about the cell’s metabolic state and readiness for division. The Rho net-
work  then  processes  these  inputs  and  activates  intracellular  signaling 
pathways that shape the actin cytoskeleton—for example, by activating 
the formin proteins that promote the formation of filopodia or by stimu-
lating  ARP  complexes  at  the  leading  edge  of  the  cell  to  generate  large 
lamellipodia. 

One of the most rapid rearrangements of cytoskeletal elements occurs 
when a muscle fiber contracts in response to a signal from a motor nerve, 
as we now discuss.

muscle contraction 
Muscle contraction is the most familiar and best understood of animal 
cell movements. In vertebrates, running, walking, swimming, and flying 
all depend on the ability of skeletal muscle to contract strongly and move 
various bones. Involuntary movements such as heart pumping and gut 
peristalsis  depend  on  cardiac  muscle  and  smooth  muscle,  respectively,

associate with one another to form 
myosin filaments. (a) a molecule of 
myosin-II contains two identical heavy 
chains, each with a globular head

two light chains bound to each head, 
but these are not shown.) the tails of

coiled-coil tail. (B) the coiled-coil tails

only.

which are formed from muscle cells that differ in structure from skeletal 
muscle but use actin and myosin in a similar way to contract. Although 
muscle  cells  are  highly  specialized,  many  cell  movements—from  the 
locomotion  of  whole  cells  down  to  the  motion  of  some  components 
inside cells—also depend on the interaction of actin and myosin. Much of 
our understanding of the mechanisms of cell movement originated from 
studies of muscle cell contraction. In this section, we discuss how actin 
and myosin interact to produce this contraction.
ECB4 E17.38/17.40

muscle contraction depends on interacting filaments of 
actin and myosin 
Muscle  myosin  belongs  to  the  myosin-II  subfamily  of  myosins,  all  of 
which  are  dimers,  with  two  globular  ATPase  heads  at  one  end  and  a 
single coiled-coil tail at the other (Figure 17–38a). Clusters of myosin-II 
molecules  bind  to  each  other  through  their  coiled-coil  tails,  forming  a 
bipolar myosin filament from which the heads project (Figure 17–38B).

The myosin filament is like a double-headed arrow, with the two sets of 
myosin heads pointing in opposite directions, away from the middle. One 
set binds to actin filaments in one orientation and moves the filaments 
one way; the other set binds to other actin filaments in the opposite ori-
entation and moves the filaments in the opposite direction. As a result, 
a myosin filament slides sets of oppositely oriented actin filaments past 
one another (Figure 17–39). We can see how, therefore, if actin filaments 
and myosin filaments are organized together in a bundle, the bundle can 
generate a strong contractile force. This is seen most clearly in muscle 
contraction, but it also occurs in the much smaller contractile bundles of 
actin filaments and myosin-II filaments (see Figure 17–28B) that assemble 
transiently  in  nonmuscle  cells,  and  in  the  contractile  ring  that  pinches 
a dividing cell in two by contracting and pulling inward on the plasma 
membrane (see Figure 17–28D).

the contraction of interacting actin and myosin-II filaments in both muscle and

of the actin filament with which it interacts.

Skeletal muscle fibers are huge, multinucleated individual cells formed by

the fusion of many separate smaller cells. The nuclei of the contributing 
cells are retained in the muscle fiber and lie just beneath the plasma mem-
brane. The bulk of the cytoplasm is made up of myofibrils, the contractile 
elements of the muscle cell. These cylindrical structures are 1–2 μm in 
diameter and may be as long as the muscle cell itself (Figure 17–40a).

A myofibril consists of a chain of identical tiny contractile units, or sarco-
meres. Each sarcomere is about 2.5 μm long, and the repeating pattern 
of sarcomeres gives the vertebrate myofibril a striped appearance (Figure 
17–40B).  Sarcomeres  are  highly  organized  assemblies  of  two  types  of 
filaments—actin filaments and myosin filaments composed of a muscle-
specific form of myosin-II. The myosin filaments (the thick filaments) are 
centrally positioned in each sarcomere, whereas the more slender actin 
filaments (the thin filaments) extend inward from each end of the sarco-
mere, where they are anchored by their plus ends to a structure known as 
the Z disc. The minus ends of the actin filaments overlap the ends of the 
myosin filaments (Figure 17–41).

The contraction of a muscle cell is caused by a simultaneous shortening 
of all the cell’s sarcomeres, which is caused by the actin filaments slid-
ing past the myosin filaments, with no change in the length of either type 
of  filament  (Figure  17–42).  The  sliding  motion  is  generated  by  myosin 
heads that project from the sides of the myosin filament and interact with 
adjacent actin filaments (see Figure 17–39). When a muscle is stimulated

anchored by their plus ends to the Z disc and that myosin filaments are bipolar. (B) During contraction, the actin and 
myosin filaments slide past each other without shortening. the sliding motion is driven by the myosin heads walking 
toward the plus end of the adjacent actin filaments (movie 17.9). 

to contract, the myosin heads start to walk along the actin filament in 
repeated  cycles  of  attachment  and  detachment.  During  each  cycle,  a 
myosin head binds and hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP. This causes a 
series of conformational changes that move the tip of the head by about 
5  nm  along  the  actin  filament  toward  the  plus  end.  This  movement, 
repeated with each round of ATP hydrolysis, propels the myosin molecule 
unidirectionally along the actin filament (Figure 17–43). In so doing, the 
myosin heads pull against the actin filament, causing it to slide against 
the myosin filament. The concerted action of many myosin heads pulling 
the actin and myosin filaments past each other causes the sarcomere to 
contract. After a contraction is completed, the myosin heads all lose con-
tact with the actin filaments, and the muscle relaxes.

ECB4 E17.42/17.44

A myosin filament has about 300 myosin heads. Each myosin head can 
attach and detach from actin about five times per second, allowing the 
myosin and actin filaments to slide past one another at speeds of up to  
15 μm per second. This speed is sufficient to take a sarcomere from a fully 
extended state (3 μm) to a fully contracted state (2 μm) in less than one-
tenth of a second. All of the sarcomeres of a muscle are coupled together 
and  are  triggered  simultaneously  by  the  signaling  system  we  describe 
next, so the entire muscle contracts almost instantaneously.

muscle contraction is triggered by a sudden rise in 
cytosolic ca2+
The  force-generating  molecular  interaction  between  myosin  and  actin 
filaments  takes  place  only  when  the  skeletal  muscle  receives  a  signal 
from a motor nerve. The neurotransmitter released from the nerve ter-
minal triggers an action potential (discussed in Chapter 12) in the muscle 
cell  plasma  membrane.  This  electrical  excitation  spreads  in  a  matter 
of  milliseconds  into  a  series  of  membranous  tubes,  called  transverse 
(or  T )  tubules,  that  extend  inward  from  the  plasma  membrane  around 

596

each myofibril. The electrical signal is then relayed to the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum,  an  adjacent  sheath  of  interconnected  flattened  vesicles  that 
surrounds each myofibril like a net stocking (Figure 17–44).

The  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  is  a  specialized  region  of  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum in muscle cells. It contains a very high concentration of Ca2+, 
and in response to the incoming electrical excitation, much of this Ca2+ 
is released into the cytosol through a specialized set of ion channels that

ATTACHED    At the start of the cycle shown in this ﬁgure, 
a myosin head lacking a bound ATP or ADP is attached 
tightly to an actin ﬁlament in a rigor conﬁguration (so 
named because it is responsible for rigor mortis, the 
rigidity of death). In an actively contracting muscle, this 
state is very short-lived, being rapidly terminated by the 
binding of a molecule of ATP to the myosin head.

RELEASED    A molecule of ATP binds to the large cleft on 
the “back” of the myosin head (that is, on the side 
furthest from the actin ﬁlament) and immediately causes 
a slight change in the conformation of the domains that 
make up the actin-binding site. This reduces the afﬁnity 
of the head for actin and allows it to move along the 
ﬁlament. (The space drawn here between the head and 
actin emphasizes this change, although in reality the 
head probably remains very close to the actin.)

COCKED    The cleft closes like a clam shell around the 
ATP molecule, triggering a large shape change that 
causes the head to be displaced along the actin ﬁlament 
by a distance of about 5 nm. Hydrolysis of ATP occurs, but 
the ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) produced remain 
tightly bound to the myosin head.

FORCE-GENERATING    A weak binding of the myosin 
head to a new site on the actin ﬁlament causes release of 
the inorganic phosphate produced by ATP hydrolysis, 
concomitantly with the tight binding of the head to actin. 
This release triggers the power stroke—the 
force-generating change in shape during which the head 
regains its original conformation. In the course of the 
power stroke, the head loses its bound ADP, thereby 
returning to the start of a new cycle.

ATTACHED    At the end of the cycle, the myosin head is 
again bound tightly to the actin ﬁlament in a rigor

position on the actin ﬁlament, which has slid to the left 
along the myosin ﬁlament.

open in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in response to the change 
in voltage across the plasma membrane and T tubules (Figure 17–45). As 
discussed in Chapter 16, Ca2+ is widely used as a small intracellular signal 
to relay a message from the exterior to the interior of cells. In muscle, the 
rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates a molecular switch made of 
specialized accessory proteins closely associated with the actin filaments 
(Figure 17–46a). One of these proteins is tropomyosin, a rigid, rod-shaped 
molecule that binds in the groove of the actin helix, where it prevents 
the myosin heads from associating with the actin filament. The other is 
troponin, a protein complex that includes a Ca2+-sensitive protein associ-
ated with the end of a tropomyosin molecule. When the concentration of 
Ca2+ rises in the cytosol, Ca2+ binds to troponin and induces a change in 
the shape of the troponin complex. This in turn causes the tropomyosin 
molecules to shift their positions slightly, allowing myosin heads to bind 
to the actin filaments, initiating contraction (Figure 17–46B).

happen if you mixed actin  
filaments with (i) troponin alone,  
(ii) tropomyosin alone, or  
(iii) troponin plus tropomyosin, and 
then added myosin? Would the 
effects be dependent on ca2+? 

ECB4 e17.46/17.48

Because  the  signal  from  the  plasma  membrane  is  passed  within  milli-
seconds (via the transverse tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) to every 
sarcomere in the cell, all the myofibrils in the cell contract at the same 
time. The increase in Ca2+ in the cytosol is transient because, when the 
nerve signal terminates, the Ca2+ is rapidly pumped back into the sarco-
plasmic reticulum by abundant Ca2+-pumps in its membrane (discussed 
in Chapter 12). As soon as the Ca2+ concentration returns to the resting 
level, troponin and tropomyosin molecules move back to their original 
positions. This reconfiguration once again blocks myosin binding to actin 
filaments, thereby ending the contraction.

different types of muscle cells Perform different 
functions 
The highly specialized contractile machinery in muscle cells is thought 
to have evolved from the simpler contractile bundles of myosin and actin 
filaments found in all eukaryotic cells. The myosin-II in nonmuscle cells 
is also activated by a rise in cytosolic Ca2+, but the mechanism of activa-
tion is different from that of the muscle-specific myosin-II. An increase in 
Ca2+ leads to the phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin-II, which alters 
the myosin conformation and enables it to interact with actin. A similar 
activation mechanism operates in smooth muscle, which is present in the 
walls of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and arteries, and in many other 
structures  that  undergo  slow  and  sustained  involuntary  contractions. 
This mode of myosin activation is relatively slow, because time is needed 
for enzyme molecules to diffuse to the myosin heads and carry out the 
phosphorylation  and  subsequent  dephosphorylation.  However,  this 
mechanism has the advantage that—unlike the mechanism used by skel-
etal muscle cells—it can be activated by a variety of extracellular signals: 
thus smooth muscle, for example, is triggered to contract by adrenaline, 
serotonin, prostaglandins, and several other signal molecules.

In addition to skeletal and smooth muscle, other forms of muscle each 
perform  a  specific  mechanical  function.  Heart—or  cardiac—muscle,  for 
instance,  drives  the  circulation  of  blood.  The  heart  contracts  autono-
mously for the entire life of the organism—some 3 billion (3 × 109) times 
in an average human lifetime. Even subtle abnormalities in the actin or 
myosin of heart muscle can lead to serious disease. For example, muta-
tions in the genes that encode cardiac myosin-II or other proteins in the 
sarcomere cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary dis-
order responsible for sudden death in young athletes. 

essential concepts         

599

The contraction of muscle cells represents a highly specialized use of the 
basic components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. In the following chap-
ter, we discuss the crucial roles the cytoskeleton has in perhaps the most 
fundamental cell movements of all: the segregation of newly replicated 
chromosomes and the formation of two daughter cells during the process 
of cell division.

essential concePts
•	 The  cytoplasm  of  a  eukaryotic  cell  is  supported  and  organized  by 
a  cytoskeleton  of  intermediate  filaments,  microtubules,  and  actin 
filaments.
Intermediate	 filaments	 are	 stable,	 ropelike	 polymers—built	 from	
fibrous	protein	subunits—that	give	cells	mechanical	strength.	Some	
intermediate  filaments  form  the  nuclear  lamina  that  supports  and 
strengthens	the	nuclear	envelope;	others	are	distributed	throughout	
the cytoplasm. 

•	

•	 Microtubules	are	stiff,	hollow	tubes	formed	by	globular	tubulin	dim-
ers.	 They	 are	 polarized	 structures,	 with	 a	 slow-growing	 minus	 end	
and	a	fast-growing	plus	end.

•	 Microtubules	grow	out	from	organizing	centers	such	as	the	centro-

some,	in	which	the	minus	ends	remain	embedded.

•	 Many	 microtubules	 display	 dynamic	 instability,	 alternating	 rap-
idly	 between	 growth	 and	 shrinkage.	 Shrinkage	 is	 promoted	 by	 the	
hydrolysis of the GTP that is tightly bound to tubulin dimers, reducing 
the affinity of the dimers for their neighbors and thereby promoting 
microtubule disassembly.

•	 Microtubules	can	be	stabilized	by	localized	proteins	that	capture	the	
plus ends, thereby helping to position the microtubules and harness 
them for specific functions.

•	 Kinesins	 and	 dyneins	 are	 microtubule-associated	 motor	 proteins	
that	use	the	energy	of	ATP	hydrolysis	to	move	unidirectionally	along	
microtubules.	 They	 carry	 specific	 organelles,	 vesicles,	 and	 other	
types of cargo to particular locations in the cell. 

•	 Eukaryotic	cilia	and	flagella	contain	a	bundle	of	stable	microtubules.	
Their  rhythmic  beating  is  caused  by  bending  of  the  microtubules, 
driven	by	the	ciliary	dynein	motor	protein.

•	 Actin	 filaments	 are	 helical	 polymers	 of	 globular	 actin	 monomers.	
They are more flexible than microtubules and are generally found in 
bundles	or	networks.

•	 Like	microtubules,	actin	filaments	are	polarized,	with	a	fast-growing	
plus	end	and	a	slow-growing	minus	end.	Their	assembly	and	disas-
sembly are controlled by the hydrolysis of ATP tightly bound to each 
actin	monomer	and	by	various	actin-binding	proteins.

•	 The	 varied	 arrangements	 and	 functions	 of	 actin	 filaments	 in	 cells	
stem	from	the	diversity	of	actin-binding	proteins,	which	can	control	
actin	polymerization,	cross-link	actin	filaments	into	loose	networks	
or	stiff	bundles,	attach	actin	filaments	to	membranes,	or	move	two	
adjacent	filaments	relative	to	each	other.

•	 A	 concentrated	 network	 of	 actin	 filaments	 underneath	 the	 plasma

for	the	shape	and	movement	of	the	cell	surface,	including	the	move-
ments	involved	when	a	cell	crawls	along	a	surface.

•	 Myosins	are	motor	proteins	that	use	the	energy	of	ATP	hydrolysis	to	
move	along	actin	filaments.	In	nonmuscle	cells,	myosin-I	can	carry	
organelles	or	vesicles	along	actin-filament	tracks,	and	myosin-II	can	
cause adjacent actin filaments to slide past each other in contractile 
bundles.

Questions

Question 17–11
Which of the following statements are correct? explain your 
answers.
a.  Kinesin moves endoplasmic reticulum membranes along 
microtubules so that the network of er tubules becomes 
stretched throughout the cell.
b.  Without actin, cells can form a functional mitotic spindle 
and pull their chromosomes apart but cannot divide.
c.  lamellipodia and filopodia are “feelers” that a cell 
extends to find anchor points on the substratum that it will 
then crawl over.
d.  GtP is hydrolyzed by tubulin to cause the bending of 
flagella.
e.  cells having an intermediate-filament network that 
cannot be depolymerized would die.
f.  the plus ends of microtubules grow faster because they 
have a larger GtP cap.
G.  the transverse tubules in muscle cells are an extension 
of the plasma membrane, with which they are continuous; 
similarly, the sarcoplasmic reticulum is an extension of the 
endoplasmic reticulum.
H.  activation of myosin movement on actin filaments is 
triggered by the phosphorylation of troponin in some 
situations and by ca2+ binding to troponin in others.

Question 17–12
the average time taken for a molecule or an organelle to 
diffuse a distance of x cm is given by the formul

t = x2/2D

where t is the time in seconds and D is a constant called the 
diffusion coefficient for the molecule or particle. using the 

above formula, calculate the time it would take for a small 
molecule, a protein, and a membrane vesicle to diffuse from 
one side to another of a cell 10 μm across. typical diffusion 
coefficients in units of cm2/sec are: small molecule, 5 × 
10–6; protein molecule, 5 × 10–7; vesicle, 5 × 10–8. How long 
would a membrane vesicle take to reach the end of an axon 
10 cm long by free diffusion? How long would it take if it 
was transported along microtubules at 1 μm/sec?

Question 17–13
Why do eukaryotic cells, and especially animal cells, have 
such large and complex cytoskeletons? list the differences 
between animal cells and bacteria that depend on the 
eukaryotic cytoskeleton. 

Question 17–14
examine the structure of an intermediate filament shown in 
figure 17–4. does the filament have a unique polarity—that 
is, could you distinguish one end from the other by chemical 
or other means? explain your answer. 

Question 17–15
there are no known motor proteins that move on 
intermediate filaments. suggest an explanation for this.

Question 17–16
When cells enter mitosis, their existing array of cytoplasmic 
microtubules has to be rapidly broken down and replaced 
with the mitotic spindle that forms to pull the chromosomes 
into the daughter cells. the enzyme katanin, named after 
Japanese samurai swords, is activated during the onset of 
mitosis, and chops microtubules into short pieces. What 
do you suppose is the fate of the microtubule fragments 
created by katanin? explain your answer.

Question 17–21
the locomotion of fibroblasts in culture is immediately 
halted by the drug cytochalasin, whereas colchicine causes 
fibroblasts to cease to move directionally and to begin 
extending lamellipodia in seemingly random directions. 
injection of fibroblasts with antibodies to vimentin has 
no discernible effect on their migration. What do these

Question 17–22
complete the following sentence accurately, explaining your 
reason for accepting or rejecting each of the four phrases 
(more than one can be correct). the role of calcium in 
muscle contraction is:
a.  to detach myosin heads from actin.
b.  to spread the action potential from the plasma 
membrane to the contractile machinery.
c.  to bind to troponin, cause it to move tropomyosin, and 
thereby expose actin filaments to myosin heads.
d.  to maintain the structure of the myosin filament. 

Question 17–23
Which of the following changes takes place when a skeletal 
muscle contracts?
a.  Z discs move farther apart.
b.  actin filaments contract.
c.  myosin filaments contract.
d.  sarcomeres become shorter.

Question 17–17
the drug taxol, extracted from the bark of yew trees, has 
an opposite effect to the drug colchicine, an alkaloid from 
autumn crocus. taxol binds tightly to microtubules and 
stabilizes them; when added to cells, it causes much of the 
free tubulin to assemble into microtubules. in contrast, 
colchicine prevents microtubule formation. taxol is just 
as pernicious to dividing cells as colchicine, and both are 
used as anticancer drugs. based on your knowledge of 
microtubule dynamics, suggest why both drugs are toxic to 
dividing cells despite their opposite actions.

Question 17–18
a useful technique for studying microtubule motors is to 
attach them by their tails to a glass coverslip (which can be 
accomplished quite easily because the tails stick avidly to 
a clean glass surface) and then allow them to settle. the 
microtubules may then be viewed in a light microscope as 
they are propelled over the surface of the coverslip by the 
heads of the motor proteins. because the motor proteins 
attach at random orientations to the coverslip, however, 
how can they generate coordinated movement of individual 
microtubules rather than engaging in a tug-of-war? in 
which direction will microtubules crawl on a ‘bed’ of kinesin 
molecules (i.e., will they move plus-end first, or minus-end 
first)?

Question 17–19
a typical time course of polymerization of purified tubulin to 
form microtubules is shown in Figure Q17–19. 
a.  explain the different parts of the curve (labeled a, b, 
and c). draw a diagram that shows the behavior of tubulin 
molecules in each of the three phases. 
b.  How would the curve in the figure change if 
centrosomes were added at the outset?

The Cell-Division Cycle

“Where a cell arises, there must be a previous cell, just as animals can 
only arise from animals and plants from plants.” This statement, which 
appears in a book written by German pathologist Rudolf Virchow in 1858, 
carries with it a profound message for the continuity of life. If every cell 
comes from a previous cell, all living organisms—from a unicellular bac-
terium to a multicellular mammal—are products of repeated rounds of 
cell growth and division that stretch back to the beginnings of life more 
than 3 billion years ago.

A cell reproduces by carrying out an orderly sequence of events in which 
it duplicates its contents and then divides in two. This cycle of duplica-
tion and division, known as the cell cycle, is the essential mechanism 
by  which  all  living  things  reproduce.  The  details  of  the  cell  cycle  vary 
from organism to organism and at different times in an individual organ-
ism’s life. In unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, each cell 
division produces a complete new organism, whereas many rounds of 
cell division are required to make a new multicellular organism from a 
fertilized egg. Certain features of the cell cycle, however, are universal, 
as they allow every cell to perform the fundamental task of copying and 
passing on its genetic information to the next generation of cells. 

To  explain  how  cells  reproduce,  we  have  to  consider  three  major 
questions: (1) How do cells duplicate their contents—including the chro-
mosomes, which carry the genetic information? (2) How do they partition 
the duplicated contents and split in two? (3) How do they coordinate all 
the steps and machinery required for these two processes? The first ques-
tion is considered elsewhere in this book: in Chapter 6, we discuss how 
DNA is replicated, and in Chapters 7, 11, 15, and 17, we describe how the

CHapTEr 18     the cell-Division cycle

Question 18–1

consider the following statement: 
“All present-day cells have arisen 
by an uninterrupted series of cell 
divisions extending back in time to 
the first cell division.” is this strictly 
true? 

eukaryotic cell manufactures other components, such as proteins, mem-
branes, organelles, and cytoskeletal filaments. In this chapter, we tackle 
the  second  and  third  questions:  how  a  eukaryotic  cell  distributes—or 
segregates—its duplicated contents to produce two genetically identical 
daughter cells, and how it coordinates the various steps of this reproduc-
tive cycle. 

We begin with an overview of the events that take place during a typical 
cell cycle. We then describe the complex system of regulatory proteins 
called the cell-cycle control system, which orders and coordinates these 
events to ensure that they occur in the correct sequence. We next discuss 
in detail the major stages of the cell cycle, in which the chromosomes are 
duplicated and then segregated into the two daughter cells. At the end of 
the chapter, we consider how animals use extracellular signals to control 
the survival, growth, and division of their cells. These signaling systems 
allow an animal to regulate the size and number of its cells—and, ulti-
mately, the size and form of the organism itself.  

overview of the cell cycle
The  most  basic  function  of  the  cell  cycle  is  to  duplicate  accurately  the 
vast amount of DNA in the chromosomes and then to segregate the DNA 
into  genetically  identical  daughter  cells  such  that  each  cell  receives  a 
complete copy of the entire genome (Figure 18–1). In most cases, a cell 
also duplicates its other macromolecules and organelles and doubles in 
size before it divides; otherwise, each time a cell split it would get smaller 
and smaller. Thus, to maintain their size, dividing cells coordinate their 
growth with their division. We return to the topic of cell-size control later 
in the chapter; here, we focus on cell division. 

The duration of the cell cycle varies greatly from one cell type to another. 
In an early frog embryo, cells divide every 30 minutes, whereas a mam-
malian fibroblast in culture divides about once a day (Table 18–1). In this 
section,  we  describe  briefly  the  sequence  of  events  that  occur  in  fairly 
rapidly dividing (proliferating) mammalian cells. We then introduce the 
cell-cycle control system that ensures that the various events of the cycle 
take place in the correct sequence and at the correct time.

Figure 18–1 Cells reproduce by 
duplicating their contents and dividing in 
two, a process called the cell cycle. For 
simplicity, we use a hypothetical eukaryotic 
cell—with only one copy each of two 
different chromosomes—to illustrate how 
each cell cycle produces two genetically 
identical daughter cells. each daughter cell 
can divide again by going through another 
cell cycle, and so on for generation after 
generation.

the eukaryotic cell cycle usually includes four Phases
Seen  in  a  microscope,  the  two  most  dramatic  events  in  the  cell  cycle 
are  when  the  nucleus  divides,  a  process  called  mitosis,  and  when  the 
cell later splits in two, a process called cytokinesis. These two processes 
together constitute the M phase of the cycle. In a typical mammalian cell, 
the whole of M phase takes about an hour, which is only a small fraction 
of the total cell-cycle time (see Table 18–1).

The  period  between  one  M  phase  and  the  next  is  called  interphase. 
Viewed  with  a  microscope,  it  appears,  deceptively,  as  an  uneventful 
interlude during which the cell simply increases in size. Interphase, how-
ever, is a very busy time for a proliferating cell, and it encompasses the 
remaining three phases of the cell cycle. During S phase (S = synthesis), 
the cell replicates its DNA. S phase is flanked by two “gap” phases—called 
G1 and G2—during which the cell continues to grow (Figure 18–2). During 
these gap phases, the cell monitors both its internal state and external 
environment.  This  monitoring  ensures  that  conditions  are  suitable  for 
reproduction and that preparations are complete before the cell commits 
to the major upheavals of S phase (which follows G1) and mitosis (fol-
lowing G2). At particular points in G1 and G2, the cell decides whether to 
proceed to the next phase or pause to allow more time to prepare.

Figure 18–2 The eukaryotic cell cycle usually occurs in four phases. the cell 
grows continuously in interphase, which consists of three phases: G1, S, and G2. DNa 
replication is confined to S phase. G1 is the gap between M phase and S phase, and 
G2 is the gap between S phase and M phase. During M phase, the nucleus divides in 
a process called mitosis; then the cytoplasm divides, in a process called cytokinesis. 
In this figure—and in subsequent figures in the chapter—the lengths of the various 
phases are not drawn to scale: M phase, for example, is typically much shorter and 
G1 much longer than shown.

A population of proliferating cells

that the amount of fluorescence is 
directly proportional to the amount 
of dnA in each cell. to measure 
the amount of dnA in each cell, 
the cells are then passed through 
a flow cytometer, an instrument 
that measures the amount of 
fluorescence in individual cells. the

Figure 18–3 The cell-cycle control system 
ensures that key processes in the cycle 
occur in the proper sequence. the cell-
cycle control system is shown as a controller 
arm that rotates clockwise, triggering 
essential processes when it reaches 
particular transition points on the outer dial. 
these processes include DNa replication in 
S phase and the segregation of duplicated 
chromosomes in mitosis. the control system 
can transiently halt the cycle at specific 
transition points—in G1, G2, and M phase—
if extracellular or intracellular conditions are 
unfavorable. 

During all of interphase, a cell generally continues to transcribe genes, 
synthesize proteins, and grow in mass. Together with S phase, G1 and G2 
provide the time needed for the cell to grow and duplicate its cytoplasmic 
organelles. If interphase lasted only long enough for DNA replication, the 
cell would not have time to double its mass before it divided and would 
consequently shrink with each division. Indeed, in some special circum-
stances that is just what happens. In an early frog embryo, for example, 
the first cell divisions after fertilization (called cleavage divisions) serve to 
subdivide the giant egg cell into many smaller cells as quickly as possible 
(see Table 18–1). In such embryonic cell cycles, the G1 and G2 phases are 
drastically shortened, and the cells do not grow before they divide.

A cell-cycle control system triggers the major Processes 
of the cell cycle
To  ensure  that  they  replicate  all  their  DNA  and  organelles,  and  divide 
in  an  orderly  manner,  eukaryotic  cells  possess  a  complex  network  of 
regulatory  proteins  known  as  the  cell-cycle  control  system.  This  system 
guarantees  that  the  events  of  the  cell  cycle—DNA  replication,  mitosis, 
and so on—occur in a set sequence and that each process has been com-
pleted before the next one begins. To accomplish this, the control system 
is itself regulated at certain critical points of the cycle by feedback from 
the process currently being performed. Without such feedback, an inter-
ruption or a delay in any of the processes could be disastrous. All of the 
nuclear DNA, for example, must be replicated before the nucleus begins 
to divide, which means that a complete S phase must precede M phase. 
If DNA synthesis is slowed down or stalled, mitosis and cell division must 
also be delayed. Similarly, if DNA is damaged, the cycle must arrest in 
G1,  S,  or  G2  so  that  the  cell  can  repair  the  damage,  either  before  DNA 
replication is started or completed or before the cell enters M phase. The 
cell-cycle  control  system  achieves  all  of  this  by  employing  molecular 
brakes, sometimes called checkpoints, to pause the cycle at certain tran-
sition points. In this way, the control system does not trigger the next step 
in the cycle unless the cell is properly prepared. 

The cell-cycle control system regulates progression through the cell cycle 
at three main transition points (Figure 18–3). At the transition from G1 to 
S phase, the control system confirms that the environment is favorable 
for proliferation before committing to DNA replication. Cell proliferation 
in animals requires both sufficient nutrients and specific signal molecules

in  the  extracellular  environment;  if  these  extracellular  conditions  are 
unfavorable,  cells  can  delay  progress  through  G1  and  may  even  enter 
a specialized resting state known as G0 (G zero). At the transition from 
G2 to M phase, the control system confirms that the DNA is undamaged 
and fully replicated, ensuring that the cell does not enter mitosis unless 
its DNA is intact. Finally, during mitosis, the cell-cycle control machin-
ery ensures that the duplicated chromosomes are properly attached to a 
cytoskeletal machine, called the mitotic spindle, before the spindle pulls 
the chromosomes apart and segregates them into the two daughter cells.
In animals, the transition from G1 to S phase is especially important as a 
point in the cell cycle where the control system is regulated. Signals from 
other cells stimulate cell proliferation when more cells are needed—and 
block it when they are not. The cell-cycle control system therefore plays 
a central part in the regulation of cell numbers in the tissues of the body; 
if  the  control  system  malfunctions  such  that  cell  division  is  excessive, 
cancer can result. We discuss later how extracellular signals influence the 
decisions made at the G1 to S transition.

cell-cycle control is similar in All eukaryotes
Some features of the cell cycle, including the time required to complete 
certain events, vary greatly from one cell type to another, even within the 
same organism. The basic organization of the cycle, however, is essen-
tially the same in all eukaryotic cells, and all eukaryotes appear to use 
similar  machinery  and  control  mechanisms  to  drive  and  regulate  cell-
cycle events. The proteins of the cell-cycle control system first appeared 
more than a billion years ago, and they have been so well conserved over 
the course of evolution that many of them function perfectly when trans-
ferred from a human cell to a yeast (see How We Know, pp. 609–610). 

Because of this similarity, biologists can study the cell cycle and its regu-
lation  in  a  variety  of  organisms  and  use  the  findings  from  all  of  them 
to assemble a unified picture of how the cycle works. Many discoveries 
about the cell cycle have come from a systematic search for mutations 
that  inactivate  essential  components  of  the  cell-cycle  control  system 
in  yeasts.  Likewise,  studies  of  both  cultured  mammalian  cells  and  the 
embryos of frogs and sea urchins have been critical for examining the 
molecular mechanisms that underlie the cycle and its control in multicel-
lular organisms like ourselves.

the cell-cycle control system
Two types of machinery are involved in cell division: one manufactures 
the new components of the growing cell, and another hauls the compo-
nents  into  their  correct  places  and  partitions  them  appropriately  when 
the cell divides in two. The cell-cycle control system switches all this 
machinery on and off at the correct times, thereby coordinating the vari-
ous steps of the cycle. The core of the cell-cycle control system is a series 
of molecular switches that operate in a defined sequence and orchestrate 
the main events of the cycle, including DNA replication and the segrega-
tion of duplicated chromosomes. In this section, we review the protein 
components of the control system and discuss how they work together to 
trigger the different phases of the cycle.

Activated Protein kinases called cdks

Figure 18–4 progression through the 
cell cycle depends on cyclin-dependent 
protein kinases (Cdks). a cdk must bind 
a regulatory protein called a cyclin before 
it can become enzymatically active. this 
activation also requires an activating 
phosphorylation of the cdk (not shown, 
but see movie 18.1). Once activated, a 
cyclin–cdk complex phosphorylates key 
proteins in the cell that are required to 
initiate particular steps in the cell cycle. the 
cyclin also helps direct the cdk to the target 
proteins that the cdk phosphorylates.

ECB4 e18.04/18.04

Figure 18–5 The accumulation of cyclins 
helps regulate the activity of Cdks. the 
formation of active cyclin–cdk complexes 
drives various cell-cycle events, including 
entry into S phase or M phase. the figure 
shows the changes in cyclin concentration 
and cdk protein kinase activity responsible 
for controlling entry into M phase. 
Increasing concentration of the relevant 
cyclin (called M cyclin) helps direct the 
formation of the active cyclin–cdk complex 
(M–cdk) that drives entry into M phase. 
although the enzymatic activity of each 
type of cyclin-cdk complex rises and falls

complexes that initiate or regulate DNA replication, mitosis, and cytoki-
nesis. This regulation is carried out largely through the phosphorylation 
and dephosphorylation of proteins involved in these essential processes.

As discussed in Chapter 4, phosphorylation followed by dephosphoryla-
tion is one of the most common ways by which cells switch the activity of 
a protein on and off (see Figure 4–42), and the cell-cycle control system 
uses  this  mechanism  extensively  and  repeatedly.  The  phosphorylation 
reactions  that  control  the  cell  cycle  are  carried  out  by  a  specific  set  of 
protein kinases, while dephosphorylation is performed by a set of protein 
phosphatases. 

The protein kinases at the core of the cell-cycle control system are present 
in proliferating cells throughout the cell cycle. They are activated, how-
ever, only at appropriate times in the cycle, after which they are quickly 
inactivated. Thus, the activity of each of these kinases rises and falls in 
a cyclical fashion. Some of these protein kinases, for example, become 
active toward the end of G1 phase and are responsible for driving the cell 
into  S  phase;  another  kinase  becomes  active  just  before  M  phase  and 
drives the cell into mitosis. 

Switching  these  kinases  on  and  off  at  the  appropriate  times  is  partly  
the  responsibility  of  another  set  of  proteins  in  the  control  system—the 
cyclins. Cyclins have no enzymatic activity themselves, but they need to 
bind to the cell-cycle kinases before the kinases can become enzymati-
cally  active.  The  kinases  of  the  cell-cycle  control  system  are  therefore 
known  as  cyclin-dependent  protein  kinases,  or  Cdks  (Figure  18–4). 
Cyclins are so-named because, unlike the Cdks, their concentrations vary 
in a cyclical fashion during the cell cycle. The cyclical changes in cyclin 
concentrations help drive the cyclic assembly and activation of the cyc-
lin–Cdk  complexes.  Once  activated,  cyclin–Cdk  complexes  help  trigger 
various cell-cycle events, such as entry into S phase or M phase (Figure 
18–5). We discuss how the Cdks and cyclins were discovered in How We 
know, pp. 609–610.

different cyclin–cdk complexes trigger different steps in 
the cell cycle 
There are several types of cyclins and, in most eukaryotes, several types 
of  Cdks  involved  in  cell-cycle  control.  Different  cyclin–Cdk  complexes 
trigger different steps of the cell cycle. As shown in Figure 18–5, the cyc-
lin that acts in G2 to trigger entry into M phase is called M cyclin, and 
the active complex it forms with its Cdk is called M-Cdk. Other cyclins, 
called S cyclins and G1/S cyclins, bind to a distinct Cdk protein late in G1 
to form S-Cdk and G1/S-Cdk, respectively; these cyclin-Cdk complexes 
help launch S phase. The actions of S-Cdk and M-Cdk are indicated in

For  many  years,  cell  biologists  watched  the  “puppet 
show” of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and cytokinesis but had 
no idea what was behind the curtain, controlling these 
events. The cell-cycle control system was simply a “black 
box” inside the cell. It was not even clear whether there 
was a separate control system, or whether the cell-cycle 
machinery  somehow  controlled  itself.  A  breakthrough 
came  with  the  identification  of  the  key  proteins  of  the 
control system and the realization that they are distinct 
from  the  components  of  the  cell-cycle  machinery—the 
enzymes and other proteins that perform the essential 
processes of DNA replication, chromosome segregation, 
and so on.

The first components of the cell-cycle control system to 
be  discovered  were  the  cyclins  and  cyclin-dependent 
kinases (Cdks) that drive cells into M phase. They were 
found  in  studies  of  cell  division  conducted  on  animal 
eggs.

back to the egg
The fertilized eggs of many animals are especially suita-
ble for biochemical studies of the cell cycle because they 
are exceptionally large and divide rapidly. An egg of the 
frog Xenopus, for example, is just over 1 mm in diameter 
(Figure 18–6). After fertilization, it divides rapidly to par-
tition the egg into many smaller cells. These rapid cell 
cycles consist mainly of repeated S and M phases, with 
very short or no G1 or G2 phases between them. There is 
no new gene transcription: all of the mRNAs and most 
of the proteins required for this early stage of embryonic 
development are already packed into the very large egg 
during its development as an oocyte in the ovary of the 
mother. In these early division cycles (cleavage divisions), 
no  cell  growth  occurs,  and  all  the  cells  of  the  embryo 
divide synchronously, growing smaller and smaller with 
each division (see movie 18.2).

Because  of  the  synchrony,  it  is  possible  to  prepare  an 
extract from frog eggs that is representative of the cell-
cycle stage at which the extract is made. The biological 
activity of such an extract can then be tested by inject-
ing it into a Xenopus oocyte (the immature precursor of 
the unfertilized egg) and observing, microscopically, its 
effects on cell-cycle behavior. The Xenopus oocyte is an 
especially convenient test system for detecting an activ-
ity  that  drives  cells  into  M  phase,  because  of  its  large 
size, and because it has completed DNA replication and 
is arrested at a stage in the meiotic cell cycle (discussed 
in  Chapter  19)  that  is  equivalent  to  the  G2  phase  of  a 
mitotic cell cycle.

Give us an m
In  such  experiments,  Kazuo  Matsui  and  colleagues 
found  that  an  extract  from  an  M-phase  egg  instantly 
drives the oocyte into M phase, whereas cytoplasm from 
a  cleaving  egg  at  other  phases  of  the  cycle  does  not. 
When they first made this discovery, they did not know 
the  molecules  or  the  mechanism  responsible,  so  they 
referred to the unidentified agent as maturation promot-
ing  factor,  or  MPF  (Figure  18–7).  By  testing  cytoplasm 
from  different  stages  of  the  cell  cycle,  Matsui  and  col-
leagues  found  that  MPF  activity  oscillates  dramatically 
during the course of each cell cycle: it increased rapidly 
just  before  the  start  of  mitosis  and  fell  rapidly  to  zero 
toward the end of mitosis (see Figure 18–5). This oscil-
lation  made  MPF  a  strong  candidate  for  a  component 
involved in cell-cycle control.

When MPF was finally purified, it was found to contain a 
protein kinase that was required for its activity. But the 
kinase portion of MPF did not act alone. It had to have a 
specific protein (now known to be M cyclin) bound to it 
in order to function. M cyclin was discovered in a differ-
ent type of experiment, involving clam eggs.

first meiotic division (a process called maturation), causing the large nucleus to break 
down and a spindle to form. (B) When the cytoplasm is instead taken from a cleaving 
egg in interphase, it does not cause the oocyte to enter M phase. thus, the extract in  
(a) must contain some activity—a maturation promoting factor (MpF)—that triggers 
entry into M phase. 

ECB4 E18.07/18.07

fishing in clams
M cyclin was initially identified by Tim Hunt as a protein 
whose  concentration  rose  gradually  during  interphase 
and  then  fell  rapidly  to  zero  as  cleaving  clam  eggs 
went  through  M  phase  (see  Figure  18–5).  The  protein 
repeated this performance in each cell cycle. Its role in 
cell-cycle  control,  however,  was  initially  obscure.  The 
breakthrough occurred when cyclin was found to be a 
component  of  MPF  and  to  be  required  for  MPF  activ-
ity. Thus, MPF, which we now call M-Cdk, is a protein 
complex containing two subunits—a regulatory subunit, 
M cyclin, and a catalytic subunit, the mitotic Cdk. After 
the components of M-Cdk were identified, other types of 
cyclins  and  Cdks  were  isolated,  whose  concentrations 
or activities, respectively, rose and fell at other stages in 
the cell cycle.

All in the family
While  biochemists  were  identifying  the  proteins  that 
regulate  the  cell  cycles  of  frog  and  clam  embryos,  
yeast geneticists—led by Lee Hartwell, studying baker’s 
yeast (S. cerevisiae), and Paul Nurse, studying fission yeast 

(S. pombe)—were taking a genetic approach to dissect-
ing  the  cell-cycle  control  system.  By  studying  mutants 
that  get  stuck  or  misbehave  at  specific  points  in  the 
cell cycle, these researchers were able to identify many 
genes responsible for cell-cycle control. Some of these 
genes  turned  out  to  encode  cyclin  or  Cdk  proteins, 
which  were  unmistakably  similar—in  both  amino  acid 
sequence  and  function—to  their  counterparts  in  frogs 
and clams. Similar genes were soon identified in human 
cells. 

Many of the cell-cycle control genes have changed so lit-
tle during evolution that the human version of the gene 
will function perfectly well in a yeast cell. For example, 
Nurse and colleagues were the first to show that a yeast 
with a defective copy of the gene encoding its only Cdk 
fails  to  divide,  but  it  divides  normally  if  a  copy  of  the 
appropriate  human  gene  is  artificially  introduced  into 
the defective cell. Surely, even Darwin would have been 
astonished  at  such  clear  evidence  that  humans  and 
yeasts are cousins. Despite a billion years of divergent 
evolution,  all  eukaryotic  cells—whether  yeast,  animal, 
or plant—use essentially the same molecules to control 
the events of their cell cycle.

Figure 18–8. Another group of cyclins, called G1  cyclins, act earlier in 
G1 and bind to other Cdk proteins to form G1-Cdks, which help drive the 
cell through G1 toward S phase. We see later that the formation of these 
G1-Cdks  in  animal  cells  usually  depends  on  extracellular  signal  mole-
cules that stimulate cells to divide. The names of the main cyclins and 
their Cdks are listed in Table 18–2.

ECB4 e18.10/18.08

Each of these cyclin–Cdk complexes phosphorylates a different set of tar-
get proteins in the cell. G1-Cdks, for example, phosphorylate regulatory 
proteins that activate transcription of genes required for DNA replication. 
By activating different sets of target proteins, each type of complex trig-
gers a different transition step in the cycle. 

cyclin concentrations are regulated by transcription and 
by Proteolysis
As discussed in Chapter 7, the concentration of a given protein in the cell 
is determined by the rate at which the protein is synthesized and the rate 
at which it is degraded. Over the course of the cell cycle, the concentra-
tion  of  each  type  of  cyclin  rises  gradually  and  then  falls  abruptly  (see 
Figure  18–8).  The  gradual  increase  in  cyclin  concentration  stems  from 
increasing transcription of cyclin genes, whereas the rapid fall in cyclin 
concentration  is  precipitated  by  a  full-scale  targeted  destruction  of  the 
protein.

The  abrupt  degradation  of  M  and  S  cyclins  part  way  through  M  phase 
depends on a large enzyme complex called—for reasons that will become 
clear  later—anaphase-promoting  complex  (APC).  This  complex  tags 
these cyclins with a chain of ubiquitin. As discussed in Chapter 7, pro-
teins  marked  in  this  way  are  directed  to  proteasomes  where  they  are 
rapidly degraded (see Figure 7–40). The ubiquitylation and degradation of 
the cyclin returns its Cdk to an inactive state (Figure 18–9).

Cyclin destruction can help drive the transition from one phase of the cell

inactivation of M-Cdk leads to the molecular events that take the cell out 
of mitosis. 

ECB4 e18.11/18.09

the Activity of cyclin–cdk complexes depends on 
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
The appearance and disappearance of cyclin proteins play an important 
part in regulating Cdk activity during the cell cycle, but there must be more 
to the story: although cyclin concentrations increase gradually, the activ-
ity of the associated cyclin–Cdk complexes tends to switch on abruptly at 
the appropriate time in the cell cycle (see Figure 18–5). What could trigger 
the  abrupt  activation  of  these  complexes?  It  turns  out  that  the  cyclin–
Cdk complex contains inhibitory phosphates, and to become active, the 
Cdk must be dephosphorylated by a specific protein phosphatase (Figure 
18–10). Thus protein kinases and phosphatases regulate the activity of 
specific cyclin–Cdk complexes and help control progression through the 
cell cycle.

cdk Activity can be blocked by cdk inhibitor Proteins 
In addition to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the activity of Cdks 
can  also  be  modulated  by  the  binding  of  Cdk  inhibitor  proteins.  The 
cell-cycle control system uses these inhibitors to block the assembly or 
activity of certain cyclin–Cdk complexes. Some Cdk inhibitor proteins, for 
example, help maintain Cdks in an inactive state during the G1 phase of 
the cycle, thus delaying progression into S phase (Figure 18–11). Pausing 
at this transition point in G1 gives the cell more time to grow, or allows it 
to wait until extracellular conditions are favorable for division. 

the cell-cycle control system can Pause the cycle in 
various ways 
As mentioned earlier, the cell-cycle control system can transiently delay 
progress through the cycle at various transition points to ensure that the 
major events of the cycle occur in a specific order. At these transitions, 

Figure 18–10 For m-Cdk to be active, 
inhibitory phosphates must be removed. 
as soon as the M cyclin–cdk complex is 
formed, it is phosphorylated at two adjacent 
sites by an inhibitory protein kinase called 
Wee1. (For simplicity, only one inhibitory 
phosphate is shown.) this modification 
keeps M-cdk in an inactive state until these

protein phosphatase called cdc25. It is

In this instance, the inhibitor protein (called 
p27) binds to an activated cyclin–cdk

cdk from phosphorylating target proteins 
required for progress through G1 into 
S phase.  

the control system monitors the cell’s internal state and the conditions in 
its environment, before allowing the cell to continue through the cycle. 
For example, it allows entry into S phase only if environmental condi-
tions  are  appropriate;  it  triggers  mitosis  only  after  the  DNA  has  been 
completely replicated; and it initiates chromosome segregation only after 
the duplicated chromosomes are correctly aligned on the mitotic spindle.

ECB4 m17.19/18.11

To accomplish these feats, the control system uses a combination of the 
mechanisms  we  have  described.  At  the  G1-to-S  transition,  it  uses  Cdk 
inhibitors to keep cells from entering S phase and replicating their DNA 
(see  Figure  18–11).  At  the  G2-to-M  transition,  it  suppresses  the  activa-
tion of M-Cdk by inhibiting the phosphatase required to activate the Cdk 
(see Figure 18–10). And it can delay the exit from mitosis by inhibiting 
the activation of APC, thus preventing the degradation of M cyclin (see 
Figure 18–9).
These mechanisms, summarized in Figure 18–12, allow the cell to make 
“decisions” about whether to progress through the cell cycle. In the next 
section, we take a closer look at how the cell-cycle control system decides 
whether a cell in G1 should commit to divide. 

G1 PhAse
In addition to being a bustling period of metabolic activity, cell growth, 
and repair, G1 is an important point of decision-making for the cell. Based 
on  intracellular  signals  that  provide  information  about  the  size  of  the 
cell  and  extracellular  signals  reflecting  the  environment,  the  cell-cycle 
control machinery can either hold the cell transiently in G1 (or in a more 
prolonged nonproliferative state, G0), or allow it to prepare for entry into

Question 18–3

why do you suppose cells have 
evolved a special G0 phase to exit 
from the cell cycle, rather than just 
stopping in G1 and not moving on to 
s phase?

the S phase of another cell cycle. Once past this critical G1-to-S transi-
tion, a cell usually continues all the way through the rest of the cell cycle 
quickly—typically within 12–24 hours in mammals. In yeasts, the G1-to-S 
transition is therefore sometimes called Start, because passing it repre-
sents a commitment to complete a full cell cycle (Figure 18–13). 

In  this  section,  we  consider  how  the  cell-cycle  control  system  decides 
between these options—and what it does once the decision is made. The 
molecular mechanisms involved are especially important, as defects in 
them can lead to unrestrained cell proliferation and cancer.  

cdks are stably inactivated in G1
During M phase, when cells are actively dividing, the cell is awash with 
active  cyclin–Cdk  complexes.  If  those  S-Cdks  and  M-Cdks  are  not  dis-
abled by the end of M phase, the cell will immediately replicate its DNA 
and initiate another round of division, without spending any significant 
time in the G1 or G2 phases. Such rapid cycling is typically seen in some 
early embryos, where the cells get smaller with each division, having lit-
tle time to grow in between.  

To usher a cell from the upheaval of M phase to the relative tranquility 
of  G1,  the  cell-cycle  control  machinery  must  inactivate  its  inventory  of 
S-Cdk and M-Cdk. It does so by eliminating all of the existing cyclins, by 
blocking the synthesis of new ones, and by deploying Cdk inhibitor pro-
teins to muffle the activity of any remaining cyclin–Cdk complexes. The 
use  of  multiple  mechanisms  makes  this  system  of  suppression  robust, 
ensuring  that  essentially  all  Cdk  activity  is  shut  down.  This  wholesale 
inactivation resets the cell-cycle control system and generates a stable 
G1 phase, during which the cell can grow and monitor its environment 
before committing to a new round of division. 

mitogens Promote the Production of the cyclins that 
stimulate cell division
As a general rule, mammalian cells will multiply only if they are stimu-
lated to do so by extracellular signals, called mitogens, produced by other 
cells. If deprived of such signals, the cell cycle arrests in G1; if the cell is 
deprived of mitogens for long enough, it will withdraw from the cell cycle 
and enter a nonproliferating state, in which the cell can remain for days 
or weeks, months, or even for the lifetime of the organism, as we discuss 
shortly. 

Escape from cell-cycle arrest—or from certain nonproliferating states—
requires the accumulation of cyclins. Mitogens act by switching on cell 
signaling pathways that stimulate the synthesis of G1 cyclins, G1/S cyc-
lins,  and  other  proteins  involved  in  DNA  synthesis  and  chromosome 
duplication.  The  buildup  of  these  cyclins  triggers  a  wave  of  G1/S-Cdk 
activity,  which  ultimately  relieves  the  negative  controls  that  otherwise 
block progression from G1 to S phase. 
A  crucial  negative  control  is  mediated  by  the  Retinoblastoma  (Rb)  pro-
tein. Rb was initially identified from studies of a rare childhood eye tumor 
called  retinoblastoma,  in  which  the  Rb  protein  is  missing  or  defective. 
Rb is abundant in the nuclei of all vertebrate cells, where it binds to par-
ticular  transcription  regulators  and  prevents  them  from  turning  on  the 
genes  required  for  cell  proliferation.  Mitogens  release  the  Rb  brake  by 
triggering  the  activation  of  G1-Cdks  and  G1/S-Cdks.  These  complexes 
phosphorylate the Rb protein, altering its conformation so that it releases 
its  bound  transcription  regulators,  which  are  then  free  to  activate  the 
genes required for cell proliferation (Figure 18–14). 

G1 phase         

615

Figure 18–14 one way in which mitogens 
stimulate cell proliferation is by inhibiting 
the rb protein. In the absence of mitogens, 
dephosphorylated rb protein holds specific 
transcription regulators in an inactive 
state; these transcription regulators are 
required to stimulate the transcription 
of target genes that encode proteins 
needed for cell proliferation. Mitogens 
binding to cell-surface receptors activate 
intracellular signaling pathways that lead 
to the formation and activation of G1-cdk 
and G1/S-cdk complexes. these complexes 
phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, 
the rb protein, releasing the transcription 
regulators that activate the transcription of 
genes required for cell proliferation.

dnA damage can temporarily halt Progression  
through G1
The  cell-cycle  control  system  uses  several  distinct  mechanisms  to  halt 
progress through the cell cycle if DNA is damaged. It can do so at vari-
ous transition points from one phase of the cell cycle to the next. The 
mechanism that operates at the G1-to-S transition, which prevents the 
cell from replicating damaged DNA, is especially well understood. DNA 
damage in G1 causes an increase in both the concentration and activity of 
a protein called p53, which is a transcription regulator that activates the 
transcription of a gene encoding a Cdk inhibitor protein called p21. The 
p21 protein binds to G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk, preventing them from driving 
the cell into S phase (Figure 18–15). The arrest of the cell cycle in G1 gives 
the cell time to repair the damaged DNA before replicating it. If the DNA 
damage is too severe to be repaired, p53 can induce the cell to kill itself 
by undergoing a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis, which 
we discuss later. If p53 is missing or defective, the unrestrained replica-
tion of damaged DNA leads to a high rate of mutation and the production 
of cells that tend to become cancerous. In fact, mutations in the p53 gene 
are found in about half of all human cancers (movie 18.3). 

cells can delay division for Prolonged Periods by entering 
specialized nondividing states
As mentioned earlier, cells can delay progress through the cell cycle at 
specific transition points, to wait for suitable conditions or to repair dam-
aged  DNA.  They  can  also  withdraw  from  the  cell  cycle  for  prolonged 
periods—either temporarily or permanently. 

The  most  radical  decision  that  the  cell-cycle  control  system  can  make 
is  to  withdraw  the  cell  from  the  cell  cycle  permanently.  This  decision 
has  a  special  importance  in  multicellular  organisms.  Many  cells  in  the

specific protein kinases respond by both 
activating the p53 protein and halting its

protein thus accumulates and stimulates 
the transcription of the gene that encodes 
the cdk inhibitor protein p21. the p21 
protein binds to G1/S-cdk and S-cdk and 
inactivates them, so that the cell cycle 
arrests in G1.

human body permanently stop dividing when they differentiate. In such 
terminally differentiated cells, such as nerve or muscle cells, the cell-cycle 
control system is dismantled completely and genes encoding the relevant 
cyclins and Cdks are irreversibly shut down. 

In  the  absence  of  appropriate  signals,  other  cell  types  withdraw  from 
the cell cycle only temporarily, entering an arrested state called G0. They 
retain the ability to reassemble the cell-cycle control system quickly and 
to divide again. Most liver cells, for example, are in G0, but they can be 
stimulated to proliferate if the liver is damaged. 

Most of the diversity in cell-division rates in the adult body lies in the vari-
ation in the time that cells spend in G0 or in G1. Some cell types, including 
liver cells, normally divide only once every year or two, whereas certain 
epithelial cells in the gut divide more than twice a day to renew the lining 
of the gut continually. Many of our cells fall somewhere in between: they 
can divide if the need arises but normally do so infrequently.

ECB4 e18.16/18.15

s PhAse
Before a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA. As we discuss in Chapter 6, 
this replication must occur with extreme accuracy to minimize the risk of 
mutations in the next cell generation. Of equal importance, every nucle-
otide in the genome must be copied once—and only once—to prevent the 
damaging effects of gene amplification. In this section, we consider the

elegant  molecular  mechanisms  by  which  the  cell-cycle  control  system 
initiates DNA replication and, at the same time, prevents replication from 
happening more than once per cell cycle. 

s-cdk initiates dnA replication and blocks re-replication
Like  any  monumental  task,  configuring  chromosomes  for  replica-
tion requires a certain amount of preparation. For eukaryotic cells, this 
preparation begins early in G1, when DNA is made replication-ready by 
the recruitment of proteins to the sites along each chromosome where 
replication will begin. These nucleotide sequences, called origins of repli-
cation, serve as landing pads for the proteins and protein complexes that 
control and carry out DNA synthesis. 

One  of  these  protein  complexes,  called  the  origin  recognition  complex 
(ORC), remains perched atop the replication origins throughout the cell 
cycle. In the first step of replication initiation, the ORC recruits a protein 
called Cdc6, whose concentration rises early in G1. Together these pro-
teins load the DNA helicases that will open up the double helix and ready 
the origin of replication. Once this prereplicative complex is in place, the 
replication origin is loaded and ready to “fire.”

The signal to commence replication comes from S-Cdk, the cyclin–Cdk 
complex that triggers S phase. S-Cdk is assembled and activated at the 
end of G1. During S phase, it activates the DNA helicases in the prerepli-
cative complex and promotes the assembly of the rest of the proteins that 
form the replication fork (see Figure 6–19). In doing so, S-Cdk essentially 
“pulls the trigger” that initiates DNA replication (Figure 18–16).

Figure 18–16 The initiation of DNa 
replication takes place in two steps. 
During G1, cdc6 binds to the Orc, and 
together these proteins load a pair of 
DNa helicases to form the prereplicative 
complex. at the start of S phase, S-cdk 
triggers the firing of this loaded replication 
origin by guiding the assembly of the DNa 
polymerase (green) and other proteins (not 
shown) that initiate DNa synthesis at the 
replication fork (discussed in chapter 6). 
S-cdk also blocks re-replication by helping 
to phosphorylate cdc6, which marks the 
protein for degradation (not shown). 

618 

CHapTEr 18     the cell-Division cycle

S-Cdk  not  only  triggers  the  initiation  of  DNA  synthesis  at  a  replication 
origin; it also helps prevent re-replication. It does so by helping phospho-
rylate Cdc6, which marks that protein for degradation. Eliminating Cdc6 
helps ensure that DNA replication can not be reinitiated later in the same 
cell cycle. 

incomplete replication can Arrest the cell cycle in G2
Earlier, we described how DNA damage can signal the cell-cycle control 
system to delay progress through the G1-to-S transition, preventing the 
cell from replicating damaged DNA. But what if errors occur during DNA 
replication—or  if  replication  is  delayed?  How  does  the  cell  keep  from 
dividing with DNA that is incorrectly or incompletely replicated?

To address these issues, the cell-cycle control system uses a mechanism 
that can delay entry into M phase. As we saw in Figure 18–10, the activity 
of M-Cdk is inhibited by phosphorylation at particular sites. For the cell 
to progress into mitosis, these inhibitory phosphates must be removed 
by an activating protein phosphatase called Cdc25. When DNA is dam-
aged or incompletely replicated, Cdc25 is itself inhibited, preventing the 
removal of the inhibitory phosphates. As a result, M-Cdk remains inactive 
and M phase is delayed until DNA replication is complete and any DNA 
damage is repaired. 

Once a cell has successfully replicated its DNA in S phase, and progressed 
through G2, it is ready to enter M phase. During this relatively brief period, 
the cell will divide its nucleus (mitosis) and then its cytoplasm (cytokine-
sis; see Figure 18–2). In the next three sections, we describe the events 
that occur during M phase. We first present a brief overview of M phase 
as a whole and then discuss, in sequence, the mechanics of mitosis and 
of cytokinesis, with a focus on animal cells.

m PhAse
Although M phase (mitosis plus cytokinesis) occurs over a relatively short 
amount of time—about one hour in a mammalian cell that divides once 
a day, or even once a year—it is by far the most dramatic phase of the 
cell cycle. During this brief period, the cell reorganizes virtually all of its 
components  and  distributes  them  equally  into  the  two  daughter  cells. 
The earlier phases of the cell cycle, in effect, serve to set the stage for the 
drama of M phase. 

The central problem for a cell in M phase is to accurately segregate the 
chromosomes  that  were  duplicated  in  the  preceding  S  phase,  so  that 
each new daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genome. With 
minor variations, all eukaryotes solve this problem in a similar way: they 
assemble two specialized cytoskeletal machines, one that pulls the dupli-
cated chromosomes apart (during mitosis) and another that divides the 
cytoplasm into two halves (cytokinesis). We begin our discussion of M 
phase with an overview of how the cell sets the processes of M phase in 
motion.

m-cdk drives entry into m Phase and mitosis 
One of the most remarkable features of the cell-cycle control system is 
that a single protein complex, M-Cdk, brings about all the diverse and 
intricate rearrangements that occur in the early stages of mitosis. Among 
its  many  duties,  M-Cdk  helps  prepare  the  duplicated  chromosomes  for 
segregation and induces the assembly of the mitotic spindle—the machin-
ery that will pull the duplicated chromosomes apart.

phosphatase can now activate more M-cdk 
by removing the inhibitory phosphate 
groups from the cdk subunit.

Question 18–5

A small amount of cytoplasm 
isolated from a mitotic cell is 
injected into an unfertilized frog 
oocyte, causing the oocyte to 
enter m phase (see figure 18–7A). 
A sample of the injected oocyte’s 
cytoplasm is then taken and injected 
into a second oocyte, causing this 
cell also to enter m phase. the 
process is repeated many times 
until, essentially, none of the original 
protein sample remains, and yet, 
cytoplasm taken from the last in the 
series of injected oocytes is still able 
to trigger entry into m phase with 
undiminished efficiency. explain this 
remarkable observation.

M-Cdk  complexes  accumulate  throughout  G2.  But  this  stockpile  is  not 
activated  until  the  end  of  G2,  when  the  activating  phosphatase  Cdc25 
removes the inhibitory phosphates holding M-Cdk activity in check (see 
Figure  18–10).  This  activation  is  self-reinforcing:  once  activated,  each 
M-Cdk complex can indirectly activate additional M-Cdk complexes—by 
phosphorylating  and  activating  more  Cdc25  (Figure  18–17).  Activated 
M-Cdk also shuts down the inhibitory kinase Wee1 (see Figure 18–10), 
further promoting the production of activated M-Cdk. The overall con-
sequence is that, once M-Cdk activation begins, it ignites an explosive 
increase  in  M-Cdk  activity  that  drives  the  cell  abruptly  from  G2  into  M 
phase. 

cohesins and condensins help configure duplicated 
chromosomes for separation
When the cell enters M phase, the duplicated chromosomes condense, 
becoming visible under the microscope as threadlike structures. Protein 
complexes,  called  condensins,  help  carry  out  this  chromosome  con-
densation, which reduces mitotic chromosomes to compact bodies that 
can be more easily segregated within the crowded confines of the divid-
ing cell. The assembly of condensin complexes onto the DNA is triggered 
by the phosphorylation of condensins by M-Cdk. 

Even  before  mitotic  chromosomes  become  condensed,  the  replicated 
DNA is handled in a way that allows cells to keep track of the two cop-
ies. Immediately after a chromosome is duplicated during S phase, the 
two copies remain tightly bound together. These identical copies—called 
sister chromatids—each contain a single, double-stranded molecule of 
DNA, along with its associated proteins. The sisters are held together by 
protein complexes called cohesins, which assemble along the length of 
each chromatid as the DNA is replicated. This cohesion between sister 
chromatids is crucial for proper chromosome segregation, and it is bro-
ken completely only in late mitosis to allow the sisters to be pulled apart 
by the mitotic spindle. Defects in sister-chromatid cohesion lead to major 
errors in chromosome segregation. In humans, such mis-segregation can 
lead to abnormal numbers of chromosomes, as in individuals with Down 
Syndrome, who have three copies of chromosome 21. 

Cohesins and condensins are structurally related, and both are thought 
to form ring structures around chromosomal DNA. But, whereas cohes-
ins tie the two sister chromatids together (Figure 18–18a), condensins 
assemble on each individual sister chromatid at the start of M phase and 
help each of these double helices to coil up into a more compact form 
(Figure 18–18b and C). Together, these proteins help configure replicated 
chromosomes for mitosis. 

different cytoskeletal Assemblies carry out mitosis and 
cytokinesis
After  the  duplicated  chromosomes  have  condensed,  two  complex 
cytoskeletal  machines  assemble  in  sequence  to  carry  out  the  two 
mechanical processes that occur in M phase. The mitotic spindle carries 
out nuclear division (mitosis), and, in animal cells and many unicellular 
eukaryotes, the contractile ring carries out cytoplasmic division (cytokine-
sis) (Figure 18–19). Both structures disassemble rapidly after they have 
performed their tasks. 

The mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules and the various proteins 
that interact with them, including microtubule-associated motor proteins 
(discussed  in  Chapter  17).  In  all  eukaryotic  cells,  the  mitotic  spindle  is 
responsible  for  separating  the  duplicated  chromosomes  and  allocating 
one copy of each chromosome to each daughter cell.

The  contractile  ring  consists  mainly  of  actin  filaments  and  myosin  fila-
ments arranged in a ring around the equator of the cell (see Chapter 17). 
It starts to assemble just beneath the plasma membrane toward the end 
of mitosis. As the ring contracts, it pulls the membrane inward, thereby 
dividing the cell in two (see Figure 18–19). We discuss later how plant 
cells, which have a cell wall to contend with, divide their cytoplasm by a

very different mechanism.

m Phase occurs in stages
Although  M  phase  proceeds  as  a  continuous  sequence  of  events,  it  is 
traditionally  divided  into  a  series  of  stages.  The  first  five  stages  of  M 
phase—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—
constitute mitosis, which was originally defined as the period in which 
the  chromosomes  are  visible  (because  they  have  become  condensed). 
Cytokinesis, which constitutes the final stage of M phase, begins before 
mitosis  ends.  The  stages  of  M  phase  are  summarized  in  panel  18–1 
(pp. 622–623). Together, they form a dynamic sequence in which many 
independent cycles—involving the chromosomes, cytoskeleton, and cen-
trosomes—are coordinated to produce two genetically identical daughter 
cells (movie 18.4 and movie 18.5).

mitosis
Before nuclear division, or mitosis, begins, each chromosome has been 
duplicated and consists of two identical sister chromatids, held together 
along their length by cohesin proteins (see Figure 18–18A). During mito-
sis,  the  cohesin  proteins  are  cleaved,  the  sister  chromatids  split  apart, 
and the resulting daughter chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles of 
the cell by the mitotic spindle (Figure 18–20). In this section, we examine 
how  the  mitotic  spindle  assembles  and  functions.  We  discuss  how  the 
dynamic instability of microtubules and the activity of microtubule-asso-
ciated motor proteins contribute to both the assembly of the spindle and 
its  ability  to  segregate  the  duplicated  chromosomes.  We  then  consider 
the mechanism that operates during mitosis to ensure the synchronous 
separation of these chromosomes. Finally we discuss how the daughter 
nuclei form.

ECB4 E18.21/18.20

centrosomes duplicate to help form the two Poles of the 
mitotic spindle
Before M phase begins, two critical events must be completed: DNA must 
be fully replicated, and, in animal cells, the centrosome must be dupli-
cated.  The  centrosome  is  the  principal  microtubule-organizing  center 
in  animal  cells.  It  duplicates  so  that  it  can  help  form  the  two  poles  of 
the  mitotic  spindle  and  so  that  each  daughter  cell  can  receive  its  own 
centrosome.

Centrosome duplication begins at the same time as DNA replication. The 
process is triggered by the same Cdks—G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk—that initiate 
DNA replication. Initially, when the centrosome duplicates, both copies 
remain together as a single complex on one side of the nucleus. As mito-
sis begins, however, the two centrosomes separate, and each nucleates 
a radial array of microtubules called an aster. The two asters move to 
opposite sides of the nucleus to form the two poles of the mitotic spindle 
(Figure 18–21). The process of centrosome duplication and separation is 
known as the centrosome cycle.

Figure 18–21 The centrosome in an interphase cell duplicates 
to form the two poles of a mitotic spindle. In most animal cells 
in interphase (G1, S, and G2), a centriole pair (shown here as a pair 
of dark green bars) is associated with the centrosome matrix (light 
green), which nucleates microtubule outgrowth. (the volume of 
the centrosome matrix is exaggerated in this diagram for clarity.) 
centrosome duplication begins at the start of S phase and is complete 
by the end of G2. Initially, the two centrosomes remain together, but, 
in early M phase, they separate, and each nucleates its own aster of 
microtubules. the centrosomes then move apart, and the microtubules 
that interact between the two asters elongate preferentially to form a 
bipolar mitotic spindle, with an aster at each pole. When the nuclear 
envelope breaks down, the spindle microtubules are able to interact 
with the duplicated chromosomes.

Figure 18–22 a bipolar mitotic spindle is formed by the selective 
stabilization of interacting microtubules. New microtubules grow 
out in random directions from the two centrosomes. the two ends of a 
microtubule (by convention, called the plus and the minus ends) have 
different properties, and it is the minus end that is anchored in the 
centrosome (discussed in chapter 17). the free plus ends are dynamically 
unstable and switch suddenly from uniform growth (outward-pointing 
red arrows) to rapid shrinkage (inward-pointing red arrows). When two 
microtubules from opposite centrosomes interact in an overlap zone, 
motor proteins and other microtubule-associated proteins cross-link the 
microtubules together (black dots) in a way that stabilizes the plus ends 
by decreasing the probability of their depolymerization.

the mitotic spindle starts to Assemble in Prophase
The  mitotic  spindle  begins  to  form  in  prophase.  This  assembly  of  the 
highly dynamic spindle depends on the remarkable properties of microtu-
bules. As discussed in Chapter 17, microtubules continuously polymerize 
and depolymerize by the addition and loss of their tubulin subunits, and 
individual filaments alternate between growing and shrinking—a process 
called dynamic instability (see Figure 17–13). At the start of mitosis, the 
stability  of  microtubules  decreases—in  part  because  M-Cdk  phosphor-
ylates microtubule-associated proteins that influence the stability of the 
microtubules. As a result, during prophase, rapidly growing and shrinking 
microtubules extend in all directions from the two centrosomes, explor-
ing the interior of the cell.

Some of the microtubules growing from one centrosome interact with the 
microtubules from the other centrosome (see Figure 18–21). This interac-
tion stabilizes the microtubules, preventing them from depolymerizing, 
and it joins the two sets of microtubules together to form the basic frame-
work of the mitotic spindle, with its characteristic bipolar shape (movie 
18.6). The two centrosomes that give rise to these microtubules are now 
called spindle poles, and the interacting microtubules are called interpo-
lar microtubules (Figure 18–22). The assembly of the spindle is driven, in 
part, by motor proteins associated with the interpolar microtubules that 
help to cross-link the two sets of microtubules. 

In the next stage of mitosis, the duplicated chromosomes attach to the 
spindle microtubules in such a way that, when the sister chromatids sep-
arate, they will be drawn to opposite poles of the cell.

chromosomes Attach to the mitotic spindle at 
Prometaphase
Prometaphase starts abruptly with the disassembly of the nuclear enve-
lope,  which  breaks  up  into  small  membrane  vesicles.  This  process  is 
triggered by the phosphorylation and consequent disassembly of nuclear 
pore  proteins  and  the  intermediate  filament  proteins  of  the  nuclear 
lamina, the network of fibrous proteins that underlies and stabilizes the 
nuclear envelope (see Figure 17–8). The spindle microtubules, which have 
been lying in wait outside the nucleus, now gain access to the duplicated 
chromosomes and capture them (see Panel 18–1, pp. 622–623).

The spindle microtubules grab hold of the chromosomes at kinetochores, 
protein complexes that assemble on the centromere of each condensed 
chromosome during late prophase (Figure 18–23). Each duplicated chro-
mosome  has  two  kinetochores—one  on  each  sister  chromatid—which 
face  in  opposite  directions.  Kinetochores  recognize  the  special  DNA 
sequence  present  at  the  centromere:  if  this  sequence  is  altered,  kine-
tochores  fail  to  assemble  and,  consequently,  the  chromosomes  fail  to 
segregate properly during mitosis.

overproduction of connective tissue in 
skin and other organs), who, for unknown 
reasons, produce antibodies against their

Once the nuclear envelope has broken down, a randomly probing micro-
tubule encountering a kinetochore will bind to it, thereby capturing the 
chromosome. This kinetochore microtubule links the chromosome to a 
spindle  pole  (see  Figure  18–23  and  Panel  18–1,  pp.  622–623).  Because 
kinetochores on sister chromatids face in opposite directions, they tend 
to  attach  to  microtubules  from  opposite  poles  of  the  spindle,  so  that 
each duplicated chromosome becomes linked to both spindle poles. The 
attachment  to  opposite  poles,  called  bi-orientation,  generates  tension 
on the kinetochores, which are being pulled in opposite directions. This 
tension signals to the sister kinetochores that they are attached correctly 
and  are  ready  to  be  separated.  The  cell-cycle  control  system  monitors 
this tension to ensure correct chromosome attachment (see Figure 18–3), 
a safeguard we discuss in detail shortly. 

ECB4 e18.24/18.23

The number of microtubules attached to each kinetochore varies among 
species: each human kinetochore binds 20–40 microtubules, for example, 
whereas a yeast kinetochore binds just one. The three classes of microtu-
bules that form the mitotic spindle are differently colored in Figure 18–24.

Figure 18–25 motor proteins and chromosomes can direct 
the assembly of a functional bipolar spindle in the absence 
of centrosomes. In these fluorescence micrographs of embryos 
of the insect Sciara, the microtubules are stained green and the 
chromosomes red. the top micrograph shows a normal spindle 
formed with centrosomes in a normally fertilized embryo. the bottom 
micrograph shows a spindle formed without centrosomes in an 
embryo that initiated development without fertilization and thus lacks 
the centrosome normally provided by the sperm when it fertilizes the 
egg. Note that the spindle with centrosomes has an aster at each pole, 
whereas the spindle formed without centrosomes does not. as shown, 
both types of spindles are able to segregate the chromosomes. (From

chromosomes Assist in the Assembly of the mitotic 
spindle 
Chromosomes are more than passive passengers in the process of spin-
dle assembly: they can themselves stabilize and organize microtubules 
into functional mitotic spindles. In cells without centrosomes—including 
all  plant  cells  and  some  animal  cell  types—the  chromosomes  nucle-
ate  microtubule  assembly,  and  motor  proteins  then  move  and  arrange 
the microtubules and chromosomes into a bipolar spindle. Even in ani-
mal cells that normally have centrosomes, a bipolar spindle can still be 
formed  in  this  way  if  the  centrosomes  are  removed  (Figure  18–25).  In 
cells with centrosomes, the chromosomes, motor proteins, and centro-
somes work together to form the mitotic spindle. 

chromosomes line up at the spindle equator at 
metaphase
During prometaphase, the duplicated chromosomes, now attached to the 
mitotic spindle, begin to move about, as if jerked first this way and then 
that. Eventually, they align at the equator of the spindle, halfway between 
the two spindle poles, thereby forming the metaphase plate. This event 
defines the beginning of metaphase (Figure 18–26). Although the forces 
that  act  to  bring  the  chromosomes  to  the  equator  are  not  completely 
understood, both the continual growth and shrinkage of the microtubules 
and  the  action  of  microtubule  motor  proteins  are  required.  A  continu-
ous  balanced  addition  and  loss  of  tubulin  subunits  is  also  required  to 
maintain  the  metaphase  spindle:  when  tubulin  addition  to  the  ends  of 
microtubules  is  blocked  by  the  drug  colchicine,  tubulin  loss  continues 
until the metaphase spindle disappears. 

The  chromosomes  gathered  at  the  equator  of  the  metaphase  spindle 
oscillate back and forth, continually adjusting their positions, indicating 
that the tug-of-war between the microtubules attached to opposite poles 

Figure 18–26 During metaphase, duplicated chromosomes 
gather halfway between the two spindle poles. this fluorescence 
micrograph shows multiple mitotic spindles at metaphase in a fruit 
fly (Drosophila) embryo. the microtubules are stained red, and 
the chromosomes are stained green. at this stage of Drosophila 
development, there are multiple nuclei in one large cytoplasmic 
compartment, and all of the nuclei divide synchronously, which is why 
all of the nuclei shown here are at the same metaphase stage of the 
cell cycle (movie 18.7). Metaphase spindles are usually pictured in 
two dimensions, as they are here; when viewed in three dimensions, 
however, the chromosomes are seen to be gathered at a platelike 
region at the equator of the spindle—the so-called metaphase plate.

Figure 18–27 Sister chromatids separate at anaphase. In the transition from metaphase (a) to anaphase (B), sister 
chromatids (stained blue) suddenly separate, allowing the resulting chromosomes to move toward opposite poles, 
as seen in these plant cells stained with gold-labeled antibodies to label the microtubules (red). plant cells generally 
do not have centrosomes and therefore have less sharply defined spindle poles than animal cells (see Figure 18–34); 
nonetheless, spindle poles are present here at the top and bottom of each micrograph, although they cannot be 
seen. (courtesy of andrew Bajer.) 

of the spindle continues to operate after the chromosomes are all aligned. 
If one of the pair of kinetochore attachments is artificially severed with a 
laser beam during metaphase, the entire duplicated chromosome imme-
diately moves toward the pole to which it remains attached. Similarly, if 
the attachment between sister chromatids is cut, the two chromosomes 
separate and move toward opposite poles. These experiments show that 
the duplicated chromosomes are not simply deposited at the metaphase 
plate. They are suspended there under tension. In anaphase, that tension 
will pull the sister chromatids apart.

ECB4 e18.28/18.27

Proteolysis triggers sister-chromatid separation at 
Anaphase
Anaphase begins abruptly with the breakage of the cohesin linkages that 
hold sister chromatids together (see Figure 18–18A). This release allows 
each  chromatid—now  considered  a  chromosome—to  be  pulled  to  the 
spindle pole to which it is attached (Figure 18–27). This movement seg-
regates the two identical sets of chromosomes to opposite ends of the 
spindle (see Panel 18–1, pp. 622–623). 

The  cohesin  linkage  is  destroyed  by  a  protease  called  separase.  Before 
anaphase begins, this protease is held in an inactive state by an inhibitory 
protein called securin. At the beginning of anaphase, securin is targeted 
for destruction by APC—the same protein complex, discussed earlier, that 
marks M cyclin for degradation. Once securin has been removed, separ-
ase is then free to sever the cohesin linkages (Figure 18–28).

chromosomes segregate during Anaphase
Once  the  sister  chromatids  separate,  the  resulting  chromosomes  are 
pulled to the spindle pole to which they are attached. They all move at 
the same speed, which is typically about 1 μm per minute. The movement 
is the consequence of two independent processes that depend on differ-
ent parts of the mitotic spindle. The two processes are called anaphase A 
and anaphase B, and they occur more or less simultaneously. In anaphase 
A, the kinetochore microtubules shorten and the attached chromosomes 

Question 18–6

if fine glass needles are used to 
manipulate a chromosome inside a 
living cell during early m phase, it 
is possible to trick the kinetochores 
on the two sister chromatids into 
attaching to the same spindle 
pole. this arrangement is normally 
unstable, but the attachments can 
be stabilized if the needle is used 
to gently pull the chromosome so 
that the microtubules attached to 
both kinetochores (via the same 
spindle pole) are under tension. 
what does this suggest to you 
about the mechanism by which 
kinetochores normally become 
attached and stay attached to 
microtubules from opposite spindle 
poles? is the finding consistent with 
the possibility that a kinetochore 
is programmed to attach to 
microtubules from a particular 
spindle pole? explain your answers.

the ubiquitylation and destruction of an 
inhibitory protein called securin. Securin 
inhibits the activity of a proteolytic enzyme 
called separase; when freed from securin, 
separase cleaves the cohesin complexes, 
allowing the mitotic spindle to pull the sister 
chromatids apart.

the force driving this movement is 
generated mainly at the kinetochore. In 
anaphase B, the two spindle poles move 
apart as the result of two separate forces:  
(1) the elongation and sliding of the 
interpolar microtubules past one another 
pushes the two poles apart, and (2) forces 
exerted on the outward-pointing astral 
microtubules at each spindle pole pull the 
poles away from each other, toward the cell 
cortex. Both forces are thought to depend 
on the action of motor proteins associated 
with the microtubules.

further segregating the two sets of chromosomes (Figure 18–29).

The  driving  force  for  the  movements  of  anaphase  A  is  thought  to  be 
provided  mainly  by  the  loss  of  tubulin  subunits  from  both  ends  of  the 
kinetochore microtubules. The driving forces in anaphase B are thought 
to be provided by two sets of motor proteins—members of the kinesin 
and dynein families—operating on different types of spindle microtubules 
(see Figure 17–21). Kinesin proteins act on the long, overlapping interpo-
lar microtubules, sliding the microtubules from opposite poles past one 
another at the equator of the spindle and pushing the spindle poles apart. 
Dynein  proteins,  anchored  to  the  cell  cortex  that  underlies  the  plasma 
membrane, pull the poles apart (see Figure 18–29B).

An unattached chromosome will Prevent sister-
chromatid separation
If a dividing cell were to begin to segregate its chromosomes before all 
the chromosomes were properly attached to the spindle, one daughter 
cell would receive an incomplete set of chromosomes, while the other 
would receive a surplus. Both situations could be lethal. Thus, a dividing 
cell must ensure that every last chromosome is attached properly to the 
spindle before it completes mitosis. To monitor chromosome attachment, 
the cell makes use of a negative signal: unattached chromosomes send a 
“stop” signal to the cell-cycle control system. Although only some of the 
details are known, the signal inhibits further progress through mitosis by 
blocking the activation of the APC (see Figure 18–28). Without active APC, 
the sister chromatids remain glued together. Thus, none of the duplicated 
chromosomes  can  be  pulled  apart  until  every  chromosome  has  been 
positioned correctly on the mitotic spindle. This so-called spindle assem-
bly checkpoint thereby controls the onset of anaphase, as well as the exit 
from mitosis, as mentioned earlier (see Figure 18–12).

the nuclear envelope re-forms at telophase
By the end of anaphase, the daughter chromosomes have separated into 
two equal groups, one at each pole of the spindle. During telophase, the 
final  stage  of  mitosis,  the  mitotic  spindle  disassembles,  and  a  nuclear 
envelope reassembles around each group of chromosomes to form the 
two daughter nuclei (movie 18.8). Vesicles of nuclear membrane first clus-
ter around individual chromosomes and then fuse to re-form the nuclear 
envelope (see Panel 18–1, pp. 622–623). During this process, the nuclear 
pore proteins and nuclear lamins that were phosphorylated during pro-
metaphase are now dephosphorylated, which allows them to reassemble 
and  the  nuclear  envelope  and  lamina  to  re-form  (Figure  18–30).  Once 
the nuclear envelope has re-formed, the pores pump in nuclear proteins, 
the nucleus expands, and the condensed chromosomes decondense into 
their  interphase  state.  As  a  consequence  of  this  decondensation,  gene 
transcription  is  able  to  resume.  A  new  nucleus  has  been  created,  and 
mitosis is complete. All that remains is for the cell to complete its division 
into two separate daughter cells.

Question 18–7

consider the events that lead to 
the formation of the new nucleus 
at telophase. how do nuclear and 
cytosolic proteins become properly 
re-sorted so that the new nucleus 
contains nuclear proteins but not 
cytosolic proteins?

cytokinesis
Cytokinesis,  the  process  by  which  the  cytoplasm  is  cleaved  in  two, 
completes M phase. It usually begins in anaphase but is not completed 
until the two daughter nuclei have formed in telophase. Whereas mitosis 
depends on a transient microtubule-based structure, the mitotic spindle, 
cytokinesis  in  animal  cells  depends  on  a  transient  structure  based  on 
actin and myosin filaments, the contractile ring (see Figure 18–19). Both 
the plane of cleavage and the timing of cytokinesis, however, are deter-
mined by the mitotic spindle.

the mitotic spindle determines the Plane of cytoplasmic 
cleavage
The first visible sign of cytokinesis in animal cells is a puckering and fur-
rowing  of  the  plasma  membrane  that  occurs  during  anaphase  (Figure 
18–31). The furrowing invariably occurs in a plane that runs perpendicu-
lar to the long axis of the mitotic spindle. This positioning ensures that 
the cleavage furrow cuts between the two groups of segregated chromo-
somes, so that each daughter cell receives an identical and complete set 
of  chromosomes.  If  the  mitotic  spindle  is  deliberately  displaced  (using 
a  fine  glass  needle)  as  soon  as  the  furrow  appears,  the  furrow  disap-
pears and a new one develops at a site corresponding to the new spindle 
location and orientation. Once the furrowing process is well under way, 
however,  cleavage  proceeds  even  if  the  mitotic  spindle  is  artificially 
sucked out of the cell or depolymerized using the drug colchicine. 

How does the mitotic spindle dictate the position of the cleavage furrow? 
The mechanism is still uncertain, but it appears that, during anaphase, the 
overlapping interpolar microtubules that form the central spindle recruit 
and activate proteins that signal to the cell cortex to initiate the assembly 
of the contractile ring at a position midway between the spindle poles. 
Because these signals originate in the anaphase spindle, this mechanism 
also contributes to the timing of cytokinesis in late mitosis.

When the mitotic spindle is located centrally in the cell—the usual situ-
ation in most dividing cells—the two daughter cells produced will be of 
equal  size.  During  embryonic  development,  however,  there  are  some 
instances in which the dividing cell moves its mitotic spindle to an asym-
metrical  position,  and,  consequently,  the  furrow  creates  two  daughter 
cells that differ in size. In most of these asymmetric divisions, the daugh-
ters also differ in the molecules they inherit, and they usually develop into 
different cell types.

the contractile ring of Animal cells is made of Actin and 
myosin filaments
The contractile ring is composed mainly of an overlapping array of actin 
filaments and myosin filaments (Figure 18–32). It assembles at anaphase 
and is attached to membrane-associated proteins on the cytoplasmic face 
of the plasma membrane. Once assembled, the contractile ring is capable 
of  exerting  a  force  strong  enough  to  bend  a  fine  glass  needle  inserted 
into  the  cell  before  cytokinesis.  Much  of  this  force  is  generated  by  the 
sliding  of  the  actin  filaments  against  the  myosin  filaments.  Unlike  the 
stable association of actin and myosin filaments in muscle fibers, how-
ever, the contractile ring is a transient structure: it assembles to carry out 
cytokinesis,  gradually  becomes  smaller  as  cytokinesis  progresses,  and 
disassembles completely once the cell has been cleaved in two.

ECB4 E18.33/18.32

Cell division in many animal cells is accompanied by large changes in 
cell shape and a decrease in the adherence of the cell to its neighbors, to 
the extracellular matrix, or to both. These changes result, in part, from 
the reorganization of actin and myosin filaments in the cell cortex, only 
one aspect of which is the assembly of the contractile ring. Mammalian 
fibroblasts in culture, for example, spread out flat during interphase, as 
a result of the strong adhesive contacts they make with the surface they 
are growing on—called the substratum. As the cells enter M phase, how-
ever,  they  round  up.  The  cells  change  shape  in  part  because  some  of 
the plasma membrane proteins responsible for attaching the cells to the 
substratum—the integrins (discussed in Chapter 20)—become phospho-
rylated  and  thus  weaken  their  grip.  Once  cytokinesis  is  complete,  the 
daughter cells reestablish their strong contacts with the substratum and

flatten out again (Figure 18–33). When cells divide in an animal tissue, 
this cycle of attachment and detachment presumably allows the cells to 
rearrange their contacts with neighboring cells and with the extracellular 
matrix, so that the new cells produced by cell division can be accommo-
dated within the tissue.

ECB4 E18.34/18.33

cytokinesis in Plant cells involves the formation of a new 
cell wall 
The mechanism of cytokinesis in higher plants is entirely different from 
that in animal cells, presumably because plant cells are surrounded by 
a tough cell wall (discussed in Chapter 20). The two daughter cells are 
separated not by the action of a contractile ring at the cell surface but 
instead by the construction of a new wall that forms inside the dividing 
cell. The positioning of this new wall precisely determines the position of  
the  two  daughter  cells  relative  to  neighboring  cells.  Thus,  the  planes  
of cell division, together with cell enlargement, determine the final form 
of the plant.

The new cell wall starts to assemble in the cytoplasm between the two 
sets  of  segregated  chromosomes  at  the  start  of  telophase.  The  assem-
bly  process  is  guided  by  a  structure  called  the  phragmoplast,  which 
is formed by the remains of the interpolar microtubules at the equator 
of  the  old  mitotic  spindle.  Small  membrane-enclosed  vesicles,  largely 
derived  from  the  Golgi  apparatus  and  filled  with  polysaccharides  and 
glycoproteins  required  for  the  cell-wall  matrix,  are  transported  along 
the microtubules to the phragmoplast. Here, they fuse to form a disclike, 
membrane-enclosed structure, which expands outward by further vesi-
cle fusion until it reaches the plasma membrane and original cell wall, 
thereby dividing the cell in two (Figure 18–34). Later, cellulose microfi-
brils are laid down within the matrix to complete the construction of the 
new cell wall.

membrane-enclosed organelles must be distributed to 
daughter cells when a cell divides
Organelles  such  as  mitochondria  and  chloroplasts  cannot  assemble 
spontaneously  from  their  individual  components;  they  arise  only  from 
the  growth  and  division  of  the  preexisting  organelles.  Likewise,  endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus also derive from preexisting 
organelle fragments. How, then, are these various membrane-enclosed 
organelles segregated when the cell divides so that each daughter gets 
some? 

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are usually present in large numbers and 
will be safely inherited if, on average, their numbers simply double once

each cell cycle. The ER in interphase cells is continuous with the nuclear 
membrane and is organized by the microtubule cytoskeleton (see Figure 
17–20A). Upon entry into M phase, the reorganization of the microtubules 
releases the ER; in most cells, the released ER remains intact during mito-
sis and is cut in two during cytokinesis. The Golgi apparatus fragments 
during mitosis; the fragments associate with the spindle microtubules via 
motor proteins, thereby hitching a ride into the daughter cells as the spin-
dle elongates in anaphase. Other components of the cell—including the 
other membrane-enclosed organelles, ribosomes, and all of the soluble 
proteins—are inherited randomly when the cell divides.

ECB4 E18.35/18.34

Having discussed how cells divide, we now turn to the general problem 
of how the size of an animal or an organ is determined, which leads us to 
consider how cell number and cell size are controlled.

control of cell numbers And cell size
A fertilized mouse egg and a fertilized human egg are similar in size—
about 100 μm in diameter. Yet an adult mouse is much smaller than an 
adult human. What are the differences between the control of cell behav-
ior in humans and mice that generate such big differences in size? The 
same fundamental question can be asked about each organ and tissue 
in  an  individual’s  body.  What  adjustment  of  cell  behavior  explains  the 
length of an elephant’s trunk or the size of its brain or its liver? These 
questions are largely unanswered, but it is at least possible to say what 
the  ingredients  of  an  answer  must  be.  Three  fundamental  processes 
largely determine organ and body size: cell growth, cell division, and cell 
death. Each of these processes, in turn, depends on programs intrinsic to 
the individual cell, regulated by signals from other cells in the body.

In this section, we first consider how organisms eliminate unwanted cells 
by  a  form  of  programmed  cell  death  called  apoptosis.  We  then  discuss 
how extracellular signals balance cell death, cell growth, and cell divi-
sion—thereby helping control the size of an animal and its organs. We 
conclude the section with a brief discussion of the extracellular signals 
that help keep these three processes in check.

Figure 18–34 Cytokinesis in a plant cell 
is guided by a specialized microtubule-
based structure called the phragmoplast. 
at the beginning of telophase, after the 
chromosomes have segregated, a new 
cell wall starts to assemble inside the cell 
at the equator of the old spindle (a). the 
interpolar microtubules of the mitotic 
spindle remaining at telophase form the 
phragmoplast and guide vesicles, derived 
from the Golgi apparatus, toward the 
equator of the spindle. the vesicles, which 
are filled with cell-wall material, fuse to 
form the growing new cell wall that grows 
outward to reach the plasma membrane 
and original cell wall (B). the pre-existing 
plasma membrane and the membrane 
surrounding the new cell wall (both shown 
in red) then fuse, completely separating the 
two daughter cells (c). a light micrograph 
of a plant cell in telophase is shown in (D) at 
a stage corresponding to (a). the cell has 
been stained to show both the microtubules 
and the two sets of chromosomes 
segregated at the two poles of the spindle. 
the location of the growing new cell wall is 
indicated by the arrowheads. (D, courtesy of

the Golgi apparatus is thought to 
be partitioned into the daughter 
cells at cell division by a random 
distribution of fragments that 
are created at mitosis. explain 
why random partitioning of 
chromosomes would not work.

CHapTEr 18     the cell-Division cycle

Apoptosis helps regulate Animal cell numbers
The cells of a multicellular organism are members of a highly organized 
community. The number of cells in this community is tightly regulated—
not simply by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling 
the  rate  of  cell  death.  If  cells  are  no  longer  needed,  they  can  commit 
suicide  by  activating  an  intracellular  death  program—a  process  called 
programmed  cell  death.  In  animals,  the  most  common  form  of  pro-
grammed  cell  death  is  called  apoptosis  (from  a  Greek  word  meaning 
“falling off,” as leaves fall from a tree). 

The amount of apoptosis that occurs in both developing and adult animal 
tissues can be astonishing. In the developing vertebrate nervous system, 
for  example,  more  than  half  of  some  types  of  nerve  cells  normally  die 
soon after they are formed. In a healthy adult human, billions of cells die 
in the bone marrow and intestine every hour. It seems remarkably waste-
ful for so many cells to die, especially as the vast majority are perfectly 
healthy at the time they kill themselves. What purposes does this massive 
cell suicide serve?

In some cases, the answers are clear. Mouse paws—and our own hands 
and feet—are sculpted by apoptosis during embryonic development: they 
start out as spadelike structures, and the individual fingers and toes sepa-
rate because the cells between them die (Figure 18–35). In other cases, 
cells die when the structure they form is no longer needed. When a tad-
pole changes into a frog at metamorphosis, the cells in the tail die, and 
the tail, which is not needed in the frog, disappears (Figure  18–36). In 
these cases, the unneeded cells die largely through apoptosis. 

In adult tissues, cell death usually exactly balances cell division, unless 
the tissue is growing or shrinking. If part of the liver is removed in an adult 
rat, for example, liver cells proliferate to make up the loss. Conversely, 
if a rat is treated with the drug phenobarbital, which stimulates liver cell 
division, the liver enlarges. However, when the phenobarbital treatment 
is  stopped,  apoptosis  in  the  liver  greatly  increases  until  the  organ  has 
returned to its original size, usually within a week or so. Thus, the liver is 
kept at a constant size through regulation of both the cell death rate and 
the cell birth rate.

Apoptosis is mediated by an intracellular Proteolytic 
cascade
Cells that die as a result of acute injury typically swell and burst, spill-
ing their contents all over their neighbors, a process called cell necrosis 
(Figure 18–37a). This eruption triggers a potentially damaging inflamma-
tory response. By contrast, a cell that undergoes apoptosis dies neatly, 
without  damaging  its  neighbors.  A  cell  in  the  throes  of  apoptosis  may

develop  irregular  bulges—or  blebs—on  its  surface;  but  it  then  shrinks 
and condenses (Figure 18–37b). The cytoskeleton collapses, the nuclear 
envelope disassembles, and the nuclear DNA breaks up into fragments 
(movie 18.9). Most importantly, the cell surface is altered in such a man-
ner  that  it  immediately  attracts  phagocytic  cells,  usually  specialized 
phagocytic  cells  called  macrophages  (see  Figure  15–32B).  These  cells 
engulf the apoptotic cell before it spills its contents (Figure 18–37C). This 
rapid removal of the dying cell avoids the damaging consequences of cell 
necrosis, and it also allows the organic components of the apoptotic cell 
to be recycled by the cell that ingests it.

ECB4 e18.37/18.36

The  molecular  machinery  responsible  for  apoptosis,  which  seems  to 
be  similar  in  most  animal  cells,  involves  a  family  of  proteases  called 
caspases.  These  enzymes  are  made  as  inactive  precursors,  called 
procaspases, which are activated in response to signals that induce apop-
tosis  (Figure  18–38a).  Two  types  of  caspases  work  together  to  take  a 
cell  apart.  Initiator  caspases  cleave,  and  thereby  activate,  downstream 
executioner caspases. Some of these executioner caspases then activate 
additional  executioners,  kicking  off  an  amplifying,  proteolytic  cascade; 

Question 18–10

why do you think apoptosis 
occurs by a different mechanism 
from the cell death that occurs in 
cell necrosis? what might be the 
consequences if apoptosis were not 
achieved in so neat and orderly a 
fashion, whereby the cell destroys 
itself from within and avoids leakage 
of its contents into the extracellular 
space?

Figure 18–38 apoptosis is mediated by 
an intracellular proteolytic cascade.  
(a) each suicide protease (caspase) is made 
as an inactive proenzyme, a procaspase, 
which is itself often activated by proteolytic 
cleavage by another member of the same 
protease family. two cleaved fragments from 
each of two procaspase molecules associate 
to form an active caspase, which is formed 
from two small and two large subunits; the 
two prodomains are usually discarded.  
(B) each activated initiator caspase molecule 
can cleave many executioner procaspase 
molecules, thereby activating them, and 
these can activate even more procaspase 
molecules. In this way, an initial activation 
of a small number of initiator caspase 
molecules can lead, via an amplifying 
chain reaction (a cascade), to the explosive 
activation of a large number of executioner 
caspase molecules. Some of the activated 
executioner caspases break down key 
proteins in the cell, such as the nuclear 
lamins, leading to the controlled death of 
the cell. the proteolytic cascade begins 
when initiator procaspases are activated, as 
we discuss shortly.

others  dismember  other  key  proteins  in  the  cell  (Figure  18–38b).  For 
example, one executioner caspase targets the lamin proteins that form 
the nuclear lamina underlying the nuclear envelope; this cleavage causes 
the irreversible breakdown of the  nuclear lamina, which allows  nucle-
ases to enter the nucleus and break down the DNA. In this way, the cell 
dismantles itself quickly and cleanly, and its corpse is rapidly taken up 
and digested by another cell.

ECB4 e18.39/18.38

Activation of the apoptotic program, like entry into a new stage of the cell 
cycle, is usually triggered in an all-or-none fashion. The caspase cascade 
is not only destructive and self-amplifying but also irreversible; once a 
cell reaches a critical point along the path to destruction, it cannot turn 
back. Thus it is important that the decision to die be tightly controlled.

the intrinsic Apoptotic death Program is regulated by the 
bcl2 family of intracellular Proteins
All nucleated animal cells contain the seeds of their own destruction: in 
these  cells,  inactive  procaspases  lie  waiting  for  a  signal  to  destroy  the 
cell. It is therefore not surprising that caspase activity is tightly regulated 
inside the cell to ensure that the death program is held in check until it is 
needed—for example, to eliminate cells that are superfluous, mislocated, 
or badly damaged.

The main proteins that regulate the activation of caspases are members 
of the Bcl2 family of intracellular proteins. Some members of this pro-
tein  family  promote  caspase  activation  and  cell  death,  whereas  others 
inhibit these processes. Two of the most important death-inducing family 
members are proteins called Bax and Bak. These proteins—which are acti-
vated in response to DNA damage or other insults—promote cell death 
by  inducing  the  release  of  the  electron-transport  protein  cytochrome  c 
from  mitochondria  into  the  cytosol.  Other  members  of  the  Bcl2  family 
(including Bcl2 itself) inhibit apoptosis by preventing Bax and Bak from 
releasing cytochrome c. The balance between the activities of pro-apop-
totic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family largely determines 
whether a mammalian cell lives or dies by apoptosis.

The cytochrome c molecules released from mitochondria activate initia-
tor procaspases—and induce cell death—by promoting the assembly of a 
large, seven-armed, pinwheel-like protein complex called an apoptosome.

Figure 18–39 bax and bak are death-
promoting members of the bcl2 family 
of intracellular proteins that can trigger 
apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c 
from mitochondria. When Bak or Bax 
proteins are activated by an apoptotic 
stimulus, they aggregate in the outer 
mitochondrial membrane, leading to the 
release of cytochrome c by an unknown 
mechanism. the cytochrome c is released 
into the cytosol from the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space (along with other 
proteins in this space—not shown). 
cytochrome c then binds to an adaptor 
protein, causing it to assemble into a 
seven-armed complex. this complex then 
recruits seven molecules of a specific 
initiator procaspase (procaspase-9) to form 
a structure called an apoptosome. the 
procaspase-9 proteins become activated 
within the apoptosome and then go on to 
activate executioner procaspases in the 
cytosol, leading to a caspase cascade and 
apoptosis.

The  apoptosome  then  recruits  and  activates  a  particular  initiator  pro-
caspase, which then triggers a caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis 
(Figure 18–39). 

extracellular signals can Also induce Apoptosis 
Sometimes the signal to commit suicide is not generated internally, but 
instead comes from a neighboring cell. Some of these extracellular sig-
nals activate the cell death program by affecting the activity of members 
of the Bcl2 family of proteins. Others stimulate apoptosis more directly by 
activating a set of cell-surface receptor proteins known as death receptors.

ECB4 e18.40/18.39

One  particularly  well-understood  death  receptor,  called  Fas,  is  present 
on the surface of a variety of mammalian cell types. Fas is activated by 
a membrane-bound protein, called Fas ligand, present on the surface of 
specialized immune cells called killer lymphocytes. These killer cells help 
regulate immune responses by inducing apoptosis in other immune cells 
that are unwanted or are no longer needed—and activating Fas is one 
way  they  do  so.  The  binding  of  Fas  ligand  to  its  receptor  triggers  the 
assembly of a death-inducing signaling complex, which includes specific 
initiator procaspases that, when activated, launch a caspase cascade that 
leads to cell death (Figure 18–40). 

Animal cells require extracellular signals to survive,  
Grow, and divide 
In a multicellular organism, the fate of individual cells is controlled by 
signals  from  other  cells.  For  either  tissue  growth  or  cell  replacement, 
cells must grow before they divide. Nutrients are not enough for an ani-
mal cell to survive, grow, or divide. It must also receive chemical signals 
from other cells, usually its neighbors. Such controls ensure that a cell 
survives  only  when  it  is  needed  and  divides  only  when  another  cell  is 
required, either to allow tissue growth or to replace cell loss. 

Most of the extracellular signal molecules that influence cell survival, cell 
growth,  and  cell  division  are  either  soluble  proteins  secreted  by  other 
cells  or  proteins  that  are  bound  to  the  surface  of  other  cells  or  to  the

extracellular  matrix.  Although  most  act  positively  to  stimulate  one  or 
more of these cell processes, some act negatively to inhibit a particular 
process.  The  positively  acting  signal  proteins  can  be  classified,  on  the 
basis of their function, into three major categories: 

ECB4 m18.06/18.40
1.  Survival  factors  promote  cell  survival,  largely  by  suppressing 

apoptosis.

2.  Mitogens  stimulate  cell  division,  primarily  by  overcoming  the 
intracellular  braking  mechanisms  that  tend  to  block  progression 
through the cell cycle.

3.  Growth factors stimulate cell growth (an increase in cell size and 
mass) by promoting the synthesis and inhibiting the degradation of 
proteins and other macromolecules. 

These categories are not mutually exclusive, as many signal molecules 
have more than one of these functions. Unfortunately, the term “growth 
factor” is often used as a catch-all phrase to describe a protein with any 
of  these  functions.  Indeed,  the  phrase  “cell  growth”  is  frequently  used 
inappropriately to mean an increase in cell number, which is more cor-
rectly termed “cell proliferation.”

In the following three sections, we examine each of these types of signal 
molecules in turn.

survival factors suppress Apoptosis
Animal  cells  need  signals  from  other  cells  just  to  survive.  If  deprived 
of  such  survival  factors,  cells  activate  a  caspase-dependent  intracellu-
lar  suicide  program  and  die  by  apoptosis.  This  requirement  for  signals 
from  other  cells  helps  ensure  that  cells  survive  only  when  and  where 
they are needed. Many types of nerve cells, for example, are produced in 
excess in the developing nervous system and then compete for limited 
amounts of survival factors that are secreted by the target cells they con-
tact. Those nerve cells that receive enough survival factor live, while the 
others die by apoptosis. In this way, the number of surviving nerve cells 
is automatically adjusted to match the number of cells with which they 
connect (Figure 18–41). A similar dependence on survival signals from

Figure 18–41 Cell death can help adjust the number of developing nerve cells to 
the number of target cells they contact. If more nerve cells are produced than can 
be supported by the limited amount of survival factor released by the target cells, 
some cells will receive insufficient amounts of survival factor to keep their suicide 
program suppressed and will undergo apoptosis. this strategy of overproduction 
followed by culling can help ensure that all target cells are contacted by nerve cells 
and that the “extra” nerve cells are automatically eliminated. 

neighboring cells is thought to help control cell numbers in other tissues, 
both during development and in adulthood.

Survival  factors  usually  act  by  activating  cell-surface  receptors.  Once 
activated,  the  receptors  turn  on  intracellular  signaling  pathways  that 
keep  the  apoptotic  death  program  suppressed,  usually  by  regulating 
members of the Bcl2 family of proteins. Some survival factors, for exam-
ple, increase the production of Bcl2, a protein that suppresses apoptosis 
(Figure 18–42).

mitogens stimulate cell division by Promoting entry into  
s Phase
Most  mitogens  are  secreted  signal  proteins  that  bind  to  cell-surface 
receptors.  When  activated  by  mitogen  binding,  these  receptors  initiate 
various  intracellular  signaling  pathways  (discussed  in  Chapter  16)  that 
stimulate cell division. As we saw earlier, these signaling pathways act 
mainly by releasing the molecular brakes that block the transition from 
the G1 phase of the cell cycle into S phase (see Figure 18–14).
Most  mitogens  have  been  identified  and  characterized  by  their  effects 
on cells in culture. One of the first mitogens identified in this way was 
platelet-derived  growth  factor,  or  PDGF,  the  effects  of  which  are  typical 
of  many  others  discovered  since.  When  blood  clots  form  (in  a  wound, 
for example), blood platelets incorporated in the clots are stimulated to 
release PDGF. PDGF then binds to receptor tyrosine kinases (discussed in 
Chapter 16) in surviving cells at the wound site, stimulating the cells to 
proliferate and help heal the wound. Similarly, if part of the liver is lost 
through surgery or acute injury, a mitogen called hepatocyte growth factor 
helps stimulate the surviving liver cells to proliferate.

Growth factors stimulate cells to Grow
The growth of an organism or organ depends on cell growth as much 
as on cell division. If cells divided without growing, they would get pro-
gressively smaller, and there would be no increase in total cell mass. In 
single-celled organisms such as yeasts, both cell growth and cell division 
require only nutrients. In animals, by contrast, both cell growth and cell 
division depend on signals from other cells. Cell growth, unlike cell divi-
sion,  does  not  depend  on  the  cell-cycle  control  system.  Indeed,  many 

Figure 18–42 Survival factors often 
suppress apoptosis by regulating bcl2 
family members. In this case, the survival 
factor binds to cell-surface receptors that 
activate an intracellular signaling pathway, 
which in turn activates a transcription 
regulator in the cytosol. this protein moves 
to the nucleus, where it activates the gene 
encoding Bcl2, a protein that inhibits 
apoptosis.

animal  cells,  including  nerve  cells  and  most  muscle  cells,  do  most  of 
their growing after they have terminally differentiated and permanently 
stopped dividing.

Like most survival factors and mitogens, most extracellular growth fac-
tors  bind  to  cell-surface  receptors  that  activate  intracellular  signaling 
pathways.  These  pathways  lead  to  the  accumulation  of  proteins  and 
other macromolecules. Growth factors both increase the rate of synthesis 
of these molecules and decrease their rate of degradation (Figure 18–43). 

Some  extracellular  signal  proteins,  including  PDGF,  can  act  as  both 
growth factors and mitogens, stimulating both cell growth and progres-
sion through the cell cycle. Such proteins help ensure that cells maintain 
their appropriate size as they proliferate. 

Compared to cell division, there has been surprisingly little study of how 
cell size is controlled in animals. As a result, it remains a mystery how 
different  cell  types  in  the  same  animal  grow  to  be  so  different  in  size 
(Figure 18–44).

some extracellular signal Proteins inhibit cell survival, 
division, or Growth 
The extracellular signal proteins that we have discussed so far—survival 
factors, mitogens, and growth factors—act positively to increase the size 
of organs and organisms. Some extracellular signal proteins, however, 
act to oppose these positive regulators and thereby inhibit tissue growth. 
Myostatin, for example, is a secreted signal protein that normally inhibits 
the growth and proliferation of the precursor cells (myoblasts) that fuse 
to form skeletal muscle cells during mammalian development. When the 
gene that encodes myostatin is deleted in mice, their muscles grow to be 
several times larger than normal, because both the number and the size 
of muscle cells is increased. Remarkably, two breeds of cattle that were 
bred for large muscles turned out to have mutations in the gene encoding 
myostatin (Figure 18–45).

Cancers are similarly the products of mutations that set cells free from 
the normal “social” controls operating on cell survival, growth, and pro-
liferation. Because cancer cells are generally less dependent than normal 
cells on signals from other cells, they can out-survive, outgrow, and out-
divide their normal neighbors, producing tumors that can kill their host 
(see Chapter 20).

In our discussions of cell division, we have thus far focused entirely on 
the ordinary divisions that produce two daughter cells, each with a full 
and identical complement of the parent cell’s genetic material. There is, 
however,  a  different  and  highly  specialized  type  of  cell  division  called 

liver cell

Figure 18–44 The cells in an animal can differ greatly in size. the 
neuron and liver cell shown here are drawn at the same scale and 
both contain the same amount of DNa. a neuron grows progressively 
larger after it has terminally differentiated and permanently stopped 
dividing. During this time, the ratio of cytoplasm to DNa increases 
enormously—by a factor of more than 105 for some neurons. (Neuron

next chapter, we describe the special features of meiosis and how they 
underlie the genetic principles that define the laws of inheritance. 

essentiAl concePts
•	 The	eukaryotic	cell	cycle	consists	of	several	distinct	phases.	In	inter-
phase, the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is replicated; in M phase, 
the	nucleus	divides	(mitosis)	followed	by	the	cytoplasm	(cytokinesis).

•	

In	most	cells,	interphase	consists	of	an	S	phase	when	DNA	is	dupli-
cated,  plus  two  gap  phases—G1  and  G2.	 These	 gap	 phases	 give	
proliferating cells more time to grow and prepare for S phase and M 
phase.

•	 The	cell-cycle	control	system	coordinates	events	of	the	cell	cycle	by	
sequentially and cyclically switching on and off the appropriate parts 
of	the	cell-cycle	machinery.

•	 The	cell-cycle	control	system	depends	on	cyclin-dependent	protein	
kinases (Cdks), which are cyclically activated by the binding of cyclin 
proteins and by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; when acti-
vated,	Cdks	phosphorylate	key	proteins	in	the	cell.

•	 Different	 cyclin–Cdk	 complexes	 trigger	 different	 steps	 of	 the	 cell	
cycle: M-Cdk drives the cell into mitosis; G1-Cdk drives it through G1; 
G1/S-Cdk	and	S-Cdk	drive	it	into	S	phase.

•	 The	 control	 system	 also	 uses	 protein	 complexes,	 such	 as	 APC,	 to	
trigger the destruction of specific cell-cycle regulators at particular 
stages	of	the	cycle.

•	 The	cell-cycle	control	system	can	halt	the	cycle	at	specific	transition	
points  to  ensure  that  intracellular  and  extracellular  conditions  are 
favorable	and	that	each	step	is	completed	before	the	next	is	started.	
Some of these control mechanisms rely on Cdk inhibitors that block 
the	activity	of	one	or	more	cyclin–Cdk	complexes.

•	 S-Cdk	initiates	DNA	replication	during	S	phase	and	helps	ensure	that	
the	genome	is	copied	only	once.	The	cell-cycle	control	system	can	
delay  cell-cycle  progression  during  G1  or  S  phase  to  prevent  cells 
from	replicating	damaged	DNA.	It	can	also	delay	the	start	of	M	phase	
to	ensure	that	DNA	replication	is	complete.

•	 Centrosomes	duplicate	during	S	phase	and	separate	during	G2.	Some	
of  the  microtubules  that  grow  out  of  the  duplicated  centrosomes 
interact	to	form	the	mitotic	spindle.

•	 When	the	nuclear	envelope	breaks	down,	the	spindle	microtubules	
capture the duplicated chromosomes and pull them in opposite direc-
tions, positioning the chromosomes at the equator of the metaphase 
spindle.

•	 The	sudden	separation	of	sister	chromatids	at	anaphase	allows	the	
chromosomes to be pulled to opposite poles; this movement is driven 
by the depolymerization of spindle microtubules and by microtubule-
associated	motor	proteins.

•	 A	nuclear	envelope	re-forms	around	the	two	sets	of	segregated	chro-

mosomes	to	form	two	new	nuclei,	thereby	completing	mitosis.

•	

In	animal	cells,	cytokinesis	is	mediated	by	a	contractile	ring	of	actin	
filaments and myosin filaments, which assembles midway between 
the spindle poles; in plant cells, by contrast, a new cell wall forms 
inside	the	parent	cell	to	divide	the	cytoplasm	in	two.

•	

In	animals,	extracellular	signals	regulate	cell	numbers	by	controlling	
cell	survival,	cell	growth,	and	cell	proliferation.

•	 Most	animal	cells	require	survival	signals	from	other	cells	to	avoid	
apoptosis—a form of cell suicide mediated by a proteolytic caspase 
cascade; this strategy helps ensure that cells survive only when and 
where	they	are	needed.

•	 Animal	cells	proliferate	only	if	stimulated	by	extracellular	mitogens	
produced  by  other  cells;  mitogens  release  the  normal  intracellular 
brakes that block progression from G1 or G0	into	S	phase.

•	 For	 an	 organism	 or	 an	 organ	 to	 grow,	 cells	 must	 grow	 as	 well	 as	
divide;  animal  cell  growth  depends  on  extracellular  growth  factors 
that	stimulate	protein	synthesis	and	inhibit	protein	degradation.

survival,	cell	growth,	or	cell	division.

•	 Cancer	cells	fail	to	obey	these	normal	“social”	controls	on	cell	behav-
ior and therefore outgrow, out-divide, and out-survive their normal

Questions

Question 18–11
roughly, how long would it take a single fertilized human 
egg to make a cluster of cells weighing 70 kg by repeated 
divisions, if each cell weighs 1 nanogram just after cell 
division and each cell cycle takes 24 hours? why does it 
take very much longer than this to make a 70-kg adult 
human?

Question 18–12
the shortest eukaryotic cell cycles of all—shorter even 
than those of many bacteria—occur in many early animal 
embryos. these so-called cleavage divisions take place 
without any significant increase in the weight of the embryo. 
how can this be? which phase of the cell cycle would you 
expect to be most reduced?

Question 18–13
one important biological effect of a large dose of ionizing 
radiation is to halt cell division. 
A.  how does this occur? 
b.  what happens if a cell has a mutation that prevents it 
from halting cell division after being irradiated? 
c.  what might be the effects of such a mutation if the cell 
is not irradiated? 
d.  An adult human who has reached maturity will die within 
a few days of receiving a radiation dose large enough to 
stop cell division. what does that tell you (other than that 
one should avoid large doses of radiation)?

Question 18–14
if cells are grown in a culture medium containing radioactive 
thymidine, the thymidine will be covalently incorporated 
into the cell’s dnA during s phase. the radioactive 
dnA can be detected in the nuclei of individual cells by 
autoradiography (i.e., by placing a photographic emulsion 
over the cells, radioactive cells will activate the emulsion 
and be labeled by black dots when looked at under a 
microscope). consider a simple experiment in which cells 
are radioactively labeled by this method for only a short 
period (about 30 minutes). the radioactive thymidine 
medium is then replaced with one containing unlabeled 
thymidine, and the cells are grown for some additional time. 
At different time points after replacement of the medium, 
cells are examined in a microscope. the fraction of cells in 
mitosis (which can be easily recognized because the cells 
have rounded up and their chromosomes are condensed) 
that have radioactive dnA in their nuclei is then determined 
and plotted as a function of time after the labeling with 
radioactive thymidine (Figure Q18–14). 
A.  would all cells (including cells at all phases of the cell 
cycle) be expected to contain radioactive dnA after the 
labeling procedure?
b.  initially there are no mitotic cells that contain radioactive 
dnA (see figure Q18–14). why is this?
c.  explain the rise and fall and then rise again of the curve.
d.  estimate the length of the G2 phase from this graph.

Question 18–15
one of the functions of m-cdk is to cause a precipitous 
drop in m-cyclin concentration halfway through m phase. 
describe the consequences of this sudden decrease and 
suggest possible mechanisms by which it might occur. 

Question 18–16
figure 18–5 shows the rise of cyclin concentration and the 
rise of m-cdk activity in cells as they progress through the 
cell cycle. it is remarkable that the cyclin concentration 
rises slowly and steadily, whereas m-cdk activity increases 
suddenly. how do you think this difference arises? 

Question 18–17
what is the order in which the following events occur during 
cell division: 
A.  anaphase
b.  metaphase
c.  prometaphase
d.  telophase 
e.  lunar phase
f.  mitosis
G.  prophase
where does cytokinesis fit in?

Question 18–18
the lifetime of a microtubule in a mammalian cell, between 
its formation by polymerization and its spontaneous 
disappearance by depolymerization, varies with the stage of 
the cell cycle. for an actively proliferating cell, the average 
lifetime is 5 minutes in interphase and 15 seconds in mitosis. 
if the average length of a microtubule in interphase is  
20 μm, how long will it be during mitosis, assuming that 
the rates of microtubule elongation due to the addition of 
tubulin subunits in the two phases are the same?

the balance between plus-end-directed and minus-end-

commits this chromatid to a particular daughter cell? once 
initially committed, can its fate be reversed? what may 
influence this commitment?

Question 18–21
the polar movement of chromosomes during anaphase 
A is associated with microtubule shortening. in particular, 
microtubules depolymerize at the ends at which they are 
attached to the kinetochores. sketch a model that explains 
how a microtubule can shorten and generate force yet 
remain firmly attached to the chromosome.

therefore continuous from one spindle pole to the other.
d.  microtubule polymerization and depolymerization 
and microtubule motor proteins are all required for dnA 
replication.
e.  microtubules nucleate at the centromeres and then 
connect to the kinetochores, which are structures at the 
centrosome regions of chromosomes.

Question 18–24
An antibody that binds to myosin prevents the movement 
of myosin molecules along actin filaments (the interaction 
between actin and myosin is described in chapter 17).  
how do you suppose the antibody exerts this effect? what 
might be the result of injecting this antibody into cells

Sexual Reproduction and the 
Power of Genetics

Individual cells reproduce by replicating their DNA and dividing in two. 
This basic process of cell proliferation occurs in all living species—in the 
cells of multicellular organisms and in free-living cells such as bacteria 
and yeasts—and it allows each cell to pass on its genetic information to 
future generations. 

Yet reproduction in a multicellular organism—in a fish or a fly, a person 
or a plant—is a much more complicated affair. It entails elaborate devel-
opmental cycles, in which all of the organism’s cells, tissues, and organs 
must be generated afresh from a single cell. This starter cell is no ordi-
nary cell. It has a very peculiar origin: for most animal and plant species, 
it  is  produced  by  the  union  of  a  pair  of  cells  that  hail  from  two  com-
pletely  separate  individuals—a  mother  and  a  father.  As  a  result  of  this 
cell fusion—a central event in sexual reproduction—two genomes merge 
to form the genome of a new individual. The mechanisms that govern 
genetic inheritance in sexually reproducing organisms are therefore dif-
ferent, and more complex, than those that operate in organisms that pass 
on their genetic information asexually—by a straighforward cell division 
or by budding off a brand new individual.

In this chapter, we explore the cell biology of sexual reproduction. We 
discuss  what  organisms  gain  from  sex,  and  we  describe  how  they  do 
it.  We  examine  the  reproductive  cells  produced  by  males  and  females, 
and we explore the specialized form of cell division, called meiosis, that 
generates  them.  We  discuss  how  Gregor  Mendel,  a  nineteenth-century 
Austrian monk, deduced the basic logic of genetic inheritance by studying 
the progeny of pea plants. Finally, we describe how scientists can exploit 
the genetics of sexual reproduction to gain insights into human biology, 
human origins, and the molecular underpinnings of human disease.

THE BENEFITS OF SEX
Most  of  the  creatures  we  see  around  us  reproduce  sexually.  However, 
many organisms, especially those invisible to the naked eye, can produce 
offspring without resorting to sex. Most bacteria and other single-celled 
organisms  multiply  by  simple  cell  division  (Figure  19–1).  Many  plants 
also  reproduce  asexually,  forming  multicellular  offshoots  that  later 
detach  from  the  parent  to  make  new  independent  plants.  Even  in  the 
animal kingdom, there are species that can procreate without sex. Hydra 
produce young by budding (Figure 19–2). Certain worms, when split in 
two, can regenerate the “missing halves” to form two complete individu-
als. And in some species of insects, lizards, and even birds, the females 
can lay eggs that develop parthenogenetically—without the help of males, 
sperm,  or  fertilization—into  healthy  daughters  that  can  also  reproduce 
the same way. 

But while such forms of asexual reproduction are simple and direct, they 
give rise to offspring that are genetically identical to the parent organism. 
Sexual  reproduction,  on  the  other  hand,  involves  the  mixing  of  DNA 
from  two  individuals  to  produce  offspring  that  are  genetically  distinct 
from one another and from both their parents. This mode of reproduc-
tion apparently has great advantages, as the vast majority of plants and 
animals have adopted it.

Sexual Reproduction Involves Both Diploid and Haploid 
Cells
Organisms that reproduce sexually are generally diploid: each cell con-
tains two sets of chromosomes—one inherited from each parent. Because 
the two parents are members of the same species, the maternal chromo-
some  set  and  the  paternal  chromosome  set  are  very  similar.  The  most 
notable difference between them is the sex chromosomes, which, in some 
species, distinguish males from females. With the exception of these sex 
chromosomes,  the  maternal  and  paternal  versions  of  every  chromo-
some—called the maternal and paternal homologs—carry the same set 
of genes. Each diploid cell, therefore, carries two copies of every gene 
(except for those found on the sex chromosomes, which may be present 
in only one copy). 

Unlike the majority of cells in a diploid organism, however, the special-
ized cells that perform the central process in sexual reproduction—the 
germ cells, or gametes—are haploid: they each contain only one set of 
chromosomes. For most organisms, the males and females produce dif-
ferent types of gametes. In animals, one is large and nonmotile and is 
referred  to  as  the  egg;  the  other  is  small  and  motile  and  is  referred  to 
as  the  sperm  (Figure  19–3).  These  two  dissimilar  haploid  gametes  join 
together to regenerate a diploid cell, called the fertilized egg, or zygote, 
which has chromosomes from both the mother and father. The zygote 
thus produced develops into a new individual with a diploid set of chro-
mosomes that is distinct from that of either parent (Figure 19–4).

For almost all multicellular animals, including vertebrates, practically the 
whole life cycle is spent in the diploid state. The haploid cells exist only 
briefly and are highly specialized for their function as genetic ambassa-
dors. These haploid gametes are generated from diploid precursor cells 
by a specialized form of reductive division called meiosis, a process we 
discuss shortly. This precursor cell lineage, which is dedicated solely to 
the production of germ cells, is called the germ line. The cells forming 
the  rest  of  the  animal’s  body—the  somatic  cells—ultimately  leave  no

Figure 19–3 Despite their tremendous 
difference in size, sperm and egg 
contribute equally to the genetic 
character of the offspring. this difference 
in size between male and female gametes 
(in which eggs contain a large quantity of 
cytoplasm, whereas sperm contain almost 
none) is consistent with the fact that the 
cytoplasm is not the basis of inheritance. 
If it were, the female’s contribution to the

The  sexual  reproductive  cycle  thus  involves  an  alternation  of  haploid 
cells,  each  carrying  a  single  set  of  chromosomes,  with  generations  of 
diploid cells, each carrying two sets of chromosomes. One benefit of this 
arrangement is that it allows sexually reproducing organisms to produce 
offspring that are genetically diverse, as we discuss next.

Sexual Reproduction generates genetic Diversity
Sexual reproduction produces novel chromosome combinations. During 
meiosis, the maternal and paternal chromosome sets present in diploid 
germ-line  cells  are  partitioned  out  into  the  single  chromosome  sets  of 
the gametes. Each gamete will receive a mixture of maternal homologs 
and  paternal  homologs;  when  the  genomes  of  two  gametes  combine 
during fertilization, they produce a zygote with a unique chromosomal 
complement.

Of course, if the maternal and paternal homologs carry the same genes, 
why should such chromosomal assortment matter? One answer is that 
although the set of genes on each homolog is the same, the paternal and 
maternal version of each gene is not. Genes occur in variant versions, 
called alleles. For any given gene, many different alleles may be present 
in  the  “gene  pool”  of  a  species.  The  existence  of  these  variant  alleles 
means that the two copies of any given gene in a particular individual are 
likely to be somewhat different from each other—and from those carried 
by other individuals. What makes individuals within a species genetically 
unique is the inheritance of different combinations of alleles. And with 
its cycles of diploidy, meiosis, haploidy, and cell fusion, sex breaks up old 
combinations of alleles and generates new ones.

Sexual  reproduction  also  generates  genetic  diversity  through  a  second 
mechanism—genetic  recombination.  We  discuss  this  process,  which 
scrambles the genetic information on each chromosome during meiosis, 
a bit later.

Figure 19–5 Germ-line cells and somatic 
cells carry out fundamentally different 
functions. In sexually reproducing animals, 
diploid germ-line cells, which are specified 
early in development, give rise to haploid 
gametes by meiosis. the gametes 
propagate genetic information into the 
ECB4 E19.04a/19.05
next generation. Somatic cells (gray ) form 
the body of the organism and are therefore 
necessary to support sexual reproduction, 
but they themselves leave no progeny.

Sexual Reproduction gives Organisms a Competitive 
Advantage in a Changing Environment
The processes that generate genetic diversity during meiosis operate at 
random, as we will shortly discuss. That means that the alleles an indi-
vidual receives from its parents are as likely to represent a change for the 
worse as they are a change for the better. Why, then, should the ability to 
try out new genetic combinations give organisms that reproduce sexu-
ally an evolutionary advantage over those that “breed true” through an 
asexual process? This question continues to perplex evolutionary geneti-
cists, but one advantage seems to be that reshuffling genetic information 
through sexual reproduction can help a species survive in an unpredict-
ably variable environment. If two parents produce many offspring with a 
wide variety of gene combinations, they increase the odds that at least 
one of their progeny will have a combination of features necessary for 
survival in a variety of environmental conditions. They are more likely, for 
example, to survive infections by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which 
themselves  continually  change  in  a  never-ending  evolutionary  battle. 
This genetic gamble may explain why even unicellular organisms, such 
as yeasts, intermittently indulge in a simple form of sexual reproduction. 
Typically, they switch on this behavior as an alternative to ordinary cell 
division when times are hard and starvation looms. Yeasts with a genetic 
defect  that  makes  them  unable  to  reproduce  sexually  show  a  reduced 
ability to evolve and adapt when they are subjected to harsh conditions. 

Sexual reproduction may also be advantageous for another reason. In any 
population, new mutations continually occur, giving rise to new alleles—
and many of these new mutations may be harmful. Sexual reproduction 
can speed up the elimination of these deleterious alleles and help to pre-
vent them from accumulating in the population. By mating with only the 
fittest males, females select for good combinations of alleles and allow 
bad  combinations  to  be  lost  from  the  population  more  efficiently  than 
they  would  otherwise  be.  According  to  this  theory,  which  is  supported 
by some careful calculations of costs and benefits, sexual reproduction is 
favored because males can serve as a genetic filtering device: the males 
who succeed in mating allow the best, and only the best, collections of 
genes to be passed on, whereas males who fail to mate serve as a genetic 
“trash can”—a way of discarding bad collections of alleles from the popu-
lation.  Of  course,  for  social  organisms  especially,  it  must  be  conceded 
that males may sometimes make themselves useful in other ways. 

Whatever its advantages, sex has clearly been favored by evolution. In 
the following section, we review the central features of this popular form 
of reproduction, beginning with meiosis, the process by which gametes 
are formed.

MEIOSIS AND FERTILIZATION
Our modern understanding of the fundamental cycle of events involved 
in sexual reproduction grew out of discoveries reported in 1888, when 
Theodor  Boveri  noted  that  the  fertilized  egg  of  a  parasitic  roundworm 
contains  four  chromosomes,  whereas  the  worm’s  gametes  (sperm  and 
egg) contain only two. This study was the first to demonstrate that gam-
etes are haploid—they carry only a single set of chromosomes. All of the 
other cells of the body, including the germ-line cells that give rise to the 
gametes, are diploid—they carry two sets of chromosomes, one derived 
from the mother and the other from the father. Therefore, sperm and eggs 
must be produced by a special kind of “reductive” cell division in which 
the number of chromosomes is precisely halved (see Figure 19–4). The 
term meiosis was coined to describe this form of cell division; it comes 
from a Greek word meaning “diminution,” or “lessening.” 

Meiosis and Fertilization         

649

From Boveri’s experiments on worms and other species, it became clear 
that the behavior of the chromosomes, which at that time were simply 
microscopic bodies of unknown function, matched the pattern of inherit-
ance, in which the two parents make equal contributions to determining 
the  character  of  the  progeny  despite  the  enormous  difference  in  size 
between  egg  and  sperm  (see  Figure  19–3).  This  was  the  first  clue  that 
chromosomes contain the material of heredity. The study of sexual repro-
duction and meiosis therefore has a central place in the history of cell 
biology. 

In this section, we describe the cell biology of sexual reproduction from a 
modern point of view, focusing on the elaborate dance of chromosomes 
that occurs when a cell undertakes meiosis. We begin with an overview 
of how meiosis distributes chromosomes to the gametes. We then take 
a closer look at how chromosomes pair, recombine, and are segregated 
into germ cells during meiosis, thereby shuffling the maternal and pater-
nal genes into novel combinations. We also discuss what happens when 
meiosis goes awry. Finally, we consider briefly the process of fertilization, 
through which gametes come together to form a new, genetically distinct 
individual.

Meiosis Involves One Round of DNA Replication Followed 
by Two Rounds of Cell Division
Before a diploid cell divides by mitosis, it duplicates its two sets of chro-
mosomes. This duplication allows a full set of chromosomes—including 
a  complete  maternal  set  plus  a  complete  paternal  set—to  be  transmit-
ted  to  each  daughter  cell  (discussed  in  Chapter  18).  Although  meiosis 
ultimately halves this diploid chromosome complement—producing hap-
loid gametes that carry only a single set of chromosomes—it, too, begins 
with a round of chromosome duplication. The subsequent reduction in 
chromosome number occurs because this single round of duplication is 
followed by two successive cell divisions without further DNA replication 
(Figure  19–6).  One  can  imagine  that  meiosis  might  instead  occur  by  a 
simple modification of mitotic cell division: if DNA replication (S phase) 
were omitted completely, a single round of cell division could produce 
two haploid cells directly. But, for reasons that are still unclear, this is not 
the way meiosis works. 

Meiosis  begins  in  specialized  diploid  germ-line  cells  that  reside  in  the 
ovaries  or  testes.  Like  somatic  cells,  these  germ-line  cells  are  diploid; 
each  contains  two  copies  of  every  chromosome—a  paternal  homolog, 
inherited from the organism’s father, and a maternal homolog, inherited 
from  its  mother.  In  the  first  step  of  meiosis,  all  of  these  chromosomes 
are duplicated, and the resulting copies remain closely attached to each 
other, as they would during an ordinary mitosis (see “Prophase” in Panel 
18–1, pp. 622–623). The next phase of the process, however, is unique 
to meiosis. Each duplicated paternal chromosome first locates and then 
attaches  itself  to  the  corresponding  duplicated  maternal  homolog,  a 
process called pairing. Pairing ensures that the homologs will segregate 
properly during the two subsequent cell divisions and that each of the 
final gametes will receive a complete haploid set of chromosomes.

line cell is followed by two rounds of cell

produce four haploid cells. N represents the

Together, the two successive meiotic cell divisions, called meiotic division 
I (meiosis I) and meiotic division II (meiosis II), parcel out one complete 
set of chromosomes to each of the four haploid cells produced. Because 
the assignment of each homolog to the haploid daughter cells is random, 
each of the resulting gametes will receive a different mixture of maternal 
and paternal chromosomes.

Thus, meiosis produces four cells that are genetically dissimilar and that 
contain exactly half as many chromosomes as the original parent germ-
line cell. Mitosis, in contrast, produces two genetically identical daughter 
cells.  Figure  19–7  summarizes  the  molecular  events  that  distinguish

nal chromosomes. 

ECB4 E19.06/19.07

Meiosis Requires the pairing of Duplicated Homologous 
Chromosomes
As mentioned earlier, before a eukaryotic cell divides—by either meiosis 
or mitosis—it first duplicates all of its chromosomes. The twin copies of 
each duplicated chromosome, called sister chromatids, at first remain 
tightly linked along their length. The way these duplicated chromosomes 
are handled, however, differs between meiosis and mitosis. In mitosis, 
as we discuss in Chapter 18, the duplicated chromosomes line up, single 
file, at the metaphase plate (Figure 19–8a). As mitosis continues, the sis-
ter chromatids separate and are segregated into one or other of the two 
daughter cells. 

In  meiosis,  however,  the  need  to  halve  the  number  of  chromosomes 
introduces  an  extra  demand  on  the  cell-division  machinery.  To  ensure 
that  each  of  the  four  haploid  cells  produced  by  meiosis  will  receive  a 
single sister chromatid from each chromosome set, a germ-line cell must 
keep  track  of  both  the  maternal  and  paternal  homologous  chromo-
somes (homologs). It does so by pairing the duplicated homologs before 
they line up at the metaphase plate (Figure 19–8B). Each pairing forms 
a  structure  called  a  bivalent,  in  which  all  four  sister  chromatids  stick 
together until the cell is ready to divide (Figure 19–9). The maternal and 
paternal homologs will separate during meiotic division I, and the indi-
vidual sister chromatids will separate during meiotic division II.

How the homologs (and the two sex chromosomes) recognize each other 
during pairing is still not fully understood. In many organisms, the ini-
tial association depends on an interaction between matching maternal 
and paternal DNA sequences at numerous sites that are widely dispersed 
along  the  homologous  chromosomes.  Once  formed,  bivalents  are  very 
stable: they remain associated throughout the long prophase of meiosis 
I, a stage that in some organisms can last for years.

NON-SISTER CHROMATIDS WITH CROSSOVER

ECB4 n19.101/19.09

Figure 19–10 During meiosis I, non-sister chromatids in each 
bivalent swap segments of DNa. here, only two of the four sister 
chromatids in the bivalent are shown, each drawn as a DNa double 
helix. During meiosis, the protein complexes that carry out this 
homologous recombination (not shown) first produce a double-strand 
break in the DNa of one of the chromatids (either the maternal or 
paternal chromatid) and then promote the formation of a cross-strand 
exchange with the other chromatid. When this exchange is resolved, 
each chromatid will contain a segment of DNa from the other. Many 
of the steps that produce chromosome crossovers during meiosis 
resemble those that guide the repair of DNa double-strand breaks in 
somatic cells (see Figure 6–30).

Crossing-Over Occurs Between the Duplicated Maternal 
and paternal Chromosomes in Each Bivalent
The picture of meiotic division I we have just painted is greatly simplified, 
in that it leaves out a crucial feature. In sexually reproducing organisms, 
the pairing of the maternal and paternal chromosomes is accompanied 
by homologous recombination, a process in which two identical or very 
similar nucleotide sequences exchange genetic information. In Chapter 6, 
we discussed how homologous recombination is used to mend damaged 
chromosomes from which genetic information has been lost. This type of 
repair, uses information from an intact DNA double helix to restore the 
correct  nucleotide  sequence  to  a  damaged,  newly  duplicated  homolog 
(see Figure 6–30). A similar process takes place when homologous chro-
mosomes pair during the long prophase of the first meiotic division. In 
meiosis,  however,  the  recombination  occurs  between  the  non-sister 
chromatids in each bivalent, rather than between the identical sister chro-
matids  within  each  duplicated  chromosome.  As  a  result,  the  maternal 
and  paternal  homologs  end  up  physically  swapping  homologous  chro-
mosomal segments in a complex, multistep process called crossing-over 
(Figure 19–10).

Crossing-over is facilitated by the formation of a synaptonemal complex. 
As  the  duplicated  homologs  pair,  this  elaborate  protein  complex  helps 
to  hold  the  bivalent  together  and  align  the  homologs  so  that  strand 
exchange can readily occur between the non-sister chromatids. Each of 
the chromatids in a duplicated homolog (that is, each of these very long 
DNA  double  helices)  can  form  a  crossover  with  either  (or  both)  of  the 
chromatids from the other chromosome in the bivalent. The synapton-
emal complex also helps space out the crossover events that take place 
along each chromosome.

By the time prophase I ends, the synaptonemal complex has disassem-
bled, allowing the homologs to separate along most of their length. But 
each  bivalent  remains  held  together  by  at  least  one  chiasma  (plural 
chiasmata),  a  structure  named  after  the  Greek  letter  chi,  χ,  which  is 
shaped like a cross. Each chiasma corresponds to a crossover between 
two non-sister chromatids (Figure 19–11a). Most bivalents contain more 
than  one  chiasma,  indicating  that  multiple  crossovers  occur  between 
homologous chromosomes (Figure 19–11B and C). In human oocytes—
the cells that give rise to the egg—an average of two to three crossover 
events occur within each bivalent (Figure 19–12). 

Crossovers  that  occur  during  meiosis  are  a  major  source  of  genetic 
variation in sexually reproducing species. By scrambling the genetic con-
stitution of each of the chromosomes in the gamete, crossing-over helps 
to produce individuals with novel assortments of alleles. Crossing-over 
also  has  a  second  important  role  in  meiosis.  By  holding  homologous

correctly at the first meiotic division, as we discuss next.

ECB4 E19.08/19.10

Chromosome pairing and Crossing-Over Ensure the 
proper Segregation of Homologs
In most organisms, crossing-over during meiosis is required for the cor-
rect segregation of the two duplicated homologs into separate daughter 
nuclei.  The  chiasmata  created  by  crossover  events  keep  the  maternal 
and  paternal  homologs  bundled  together  until  the  spindle  separates 
them during meiotic anaphase I. Before anaphase I, the two poles of the 
spindle pull on the duplicated homologs in opposite directions, and the 
chiasmata resist this pulling (Figure 19–13a). In so doing, the chiasmata 
help to position and stabilize bivalents at the metaphase plate. 

In  addition  to  the  chiasmata,  which  hold  the  maternal  and  paternal 
homologs together, cohesin proteins (described in Chapter 18) keep the 
sister chromatids glued together along their entire length at meiosis I (see 
Figures 19–11B and 18–18). At the start of anaphase I, the cohesin pro-
teins that hold the chromosome arms together are suddenly degraded. 
This release allows the arms to separate and the recombined homologs to 
be pulled apart (Figure 19–13B). This release is necessary because if the 
arms did not come apart, the duplicated maternal and paternal homologs 
would remain tethered to one another by the homologous DNA segments 
they had exchanged. 

Figure 19–12 Multiple crossovers 
can occur between the duplicated 
homologous chromosomes in a bivalent. 
Fluorescence micrograph shows a spread of 
chromosomes from a human oocyte (egg-
cell precursor) at the stage where all four 
chromatids—both maternal and paternal 
homologs—are still tightly associated: each 
single long thread (stained red ) is a bivalent, 
containing four DNa double helices. Sites 
of crossing-over are marked by the presence 
of a protein (stained green) that is a key 
component of the meiotic recombination 
machinery. Blue staining marks the position 
of centromeres (see Figure 19–9). (From

The Second Meiotic Division produces Haploid Daughter 
Cells
To  separate  the  sister  chromatids  and  produce  cells  with  a  haploid 
amount of DNA, a second round of division, meiosis II, follows soon after 
the  first—without  further  DNA  replication  or  any  significant  interphase 
period.  A  meiotic  spindle  forms,  and  the  kinetochores  on  each  pair  of 
sister chromatids now attach to kinetochore microtubules that point in 
opposite directions, as they would in an ordinary mitotic division. At ana-
phase of meiosis II, the remaining, meiosis-specific cohesins—located in 
the centromere—are degraded, and the sister chromatids are drawn into 
different daughter cells (Figure  19–14). The entire process is shown in 
Movie 19.1.

Even  though  they  share  the  same  parents,  no  two  siblings  are  geneti-
cally the same (unless they are identical twins). These genetic differences 
are initiated long before sperm meets egg, when meiosis I produces two 
kinds of randomizing genetic reassortment.

First, as we have seen, the maternal and paternal chromosomes are shuf-
fled and dealt out randomly during meiosis I. Although the chromosomes 
are  carefully  distributed  so  that  each  cell  receives  one  and  only  one 
copy of each chromosome, the choice between the maternal or paternal 
homolog is made by chance, like the flip of a coin. Thus, each gamete 
contains the maternal versions of some chromosomes and the paternal 
versions  of  others  (Figure  19–15a).  This  random  assortment  depends 
solely on the way each bivalent happens to be positioned when it lines 
up on the spindle during metaphase of meiosis I. Whether the maternal 
or paternal homolog is captured by the microtubules from one pole or the 
other depends on which way the bivalent is facing when the microtubules 
connect to its kinetochore (see Figure 19–13). Because the orientation of 
each bivalent at the moment of capture is completely random, the assort-
ment of maternal and paternal chromosomes is random as well. 

Thanks to this random reassortment of maternal and paternal homologs, 
an individual could in principle produce 2n genetically different gametes, 
where n is the haploid number of chromosomes. With 23 chromosomes 
to choose from, each human, for example, could in theory produce 223—
or 8.4 × 106—genetically distinct gametes. The actual number of different 
gametes each person can produce, however, is much greater than that, 
because the crossing-over that takes place during meiosis provides a sec-
ond source of randomized genetic reassortment. Between two and three 
crossovers  occur  on  average  between  each  pair  of  human  homologs, 
generating new chromosomes with novel assortments of maternal and 
paternal alleles. Because crossing-over occurs at more or less random 
sites along the length of a chromosome, each meiosis will produce four 
sets of entirely novel chromosomes (Figure 19–15B). 

Taken together, the random reassortment of maternal and paternal chro-
mosomes, coupled with the genetic mixing of crossing-over, provides a

nearly limitless source of genetic variation in the gametes produced by a 
single individual. Considering that every person is formed by the fusion 
of such gametes, produced by two completely different individuals, the 
richness of human variation that we see around us, even within a single 
family, is not at all surprising.

Meiosis Is Not Flawless
The sorting of chromosomes that takes place during meiosis is a remark-
able  feat  of  molecular  bookkeeping:  in  humans,  each  meiosis  requires 
that  the  starting  cell  keep  track  of  92  chromosomes  (23  pairs,  each  of 
which  has  duplicated),  handing  out  one  complete  set  to  each  gamete. 
Not surprisingly, mistakes can occur in the distribution of chromosomes 
during this elaborate process. 

Occasionally, homologs fail to separate properly—a phenomenon known 
as nondisjunction. As a result, some of the haploid cells that are produced 
lack  a  particular  chromosome,  while  others  have  more  than  one  copy 
of  it.  Upon  fertilization,  such  gametes  form  abnormal  embryos,  most 
of which die. Some survive, however. Down syndrome, for example—a 
disorder associated with cognitive disability and characteristic physical 
abnormalities—is caused by an extra copy of Chromosome 21. This error 
results from nondisjunction of a Chromosome 21 pair during meiosis I, 
giving  rise  to  a  gamete  that  contains  two  copies  of  that  chromosome 
instead  of  one  (Figure  19–16).  When  this  abnormal  gamete  fuses  with 
a  normal  gamete  at  fertilization,  the  resulting  embryo  contains  three 
copies of Chromosome 21 instead of two. This chromosome imbalance 
produces an extra dose of the proteins encoded by Chromosome 21 and 
thereby interferes with the proper development of the embryo and nor-
mal functions in the adult. 

The frequency of chromosome mis-segregation during the production of 
human gametes is remarkably high, particularly in females: nondisjunc-
tion occurs in about 10% of the meioses in human oocytes, giving rise 
to  eggs  that  contain  the  wrong  number  of  chromosomes  (a  condition 
called  aneuploidy).  Aneuploidy  occurs  less  often  in  human  sperm,  per-
haps because sperm development is subjected to more stringent quality

Ignoring the effects of chromosome 
crossovers, an individual human can 
in principle produce 223 = 8.4 × 106 
genetically different gametes. How 
many of these possibilities can be 
“sampled” in the average life of (A) 
a female and (B) a male, given that 
women produce one egg a month 
during their fertile years, whereas 
men can make hundreds of millions 
of sperm each day?

Figure 19–16 Errors in chromosome 
segregation during meiosis can result 
in gametes with incorrect numbers 
of chromosomes. In this example, the 
duplicated maternal and paternal copies of 
chromosome 21 fail to separate normally 
during the first meiotic division. as a result, 
two of the gametes receive no copy of 
the chromosome, while the other two 
gametes receive two copies instead of the 
proper single copy. Gametes that receive 
an incorrect number of chromosomes are 
called aneuploid gametes. If one of them 
participates in the fertilization process, the 
resulting zygote will also have an abnormal 
number of chromosomes. a child that 
receives three copies of chromosome 21 
will have Down syndrome.

control than egg development. If meiosis goes wrong in male cells, a cell-
cycle checkpoint mechanism is activated, arresting meiosis and leading 
to cell death by apoptosis. Regardless of whether the segregation error 
occurs in the sperm or the egg, nondisjunction is thought to be one rea-
son  for  the  high  rate  of  miscarriages  (spontaneous  abortions)  in  early 
pregnancy in humans. 

Fertilization Reconstitutes a Complete Diploid genome
Having seen how chromosomes are parceled out during meiosis to form 
haploid  germ  cells,  we  now  briefly  consider  how  they  are  reunited  in 
the  process  of  fertilization  to  form  a  new  zygote  with  a  diploid  set  of 
chromosomes. 

Of the 300 million human sperm ejaculated during coitus, only about 200 
reach  the  site  of  fertilization  in  the  oviduct.  Sperm  are  attracted  to  an 
ovulated egg by chemical signals released by both the egg and the sup-
porting cells that surround it. Once a sperm finds the egg, it must migrate 
through a protective layer of cells and then bind to, and tunnel through, 
the egg coat, called the zona pellucida. Finally, the sperm must bind to and 
fuse with the underlying egg plasma membrane (Figure 19–17). Although 
fertilization normally occurs by this process of sperm–egg fusion, it can 
also be achieved artificially by injecting the sperm directly into the egg 
cytoplasm; this is often done in infertility clinics when there is a problem 
with natural sperm–egg fusion.

Although  many  sperm  may  bind  to  an  egg  (see  Figure  19–3),  only  one 
normally fuses with the egg plasma membrane and introduces its DNA 
into the egg cytoplasm. The control of this step is especially important 
because  it  ensures  that  the  fertilized  egg—also  called  a  zygote—will 
contain two, and only two, sets of chromosomes. Several mechanisms 
prevent multiple sperm from entering an egg. In one mechanism, the first 
successful sperm triggers the release of a wave of Ca2+ ions in the egg 
cytoplasm. This flood of Ca2+ in turn triggers the secretion of enzymes 
that cause a “hardening” of the zona pellucida, which prevents “runner 
up” sperm from penetrating the egg. The Ca2+ wave also helps trigger the 
development of the egg. To watch a fertilization-induced calcium wave, 
see Movie 19.2.

The process of fertilization is not complete, however, until the two haploid 
nuclei (called pronuclei) come together and combine their chromosomes 
into a single diploid nucleus. Soon after the pronuclei fuse, the diploid cell 
begins to divide, forming a ball of cells that—through repeated rounds of 
cell division and differentiation—will give rise to an embryo and, eventu-
ally, an adult organism. Fertilization marks the beginning of one of the 
most remarkable phenomena in all of biology—the process by which a 
single-celled zygote initiates the developmental program that directs the 
formation of a new individual.

MENDEL AND THE LAWS OF INHERITANCE
In organisms that reproduce without sex, the genetic material of the par-
ent is transmitted faithfully to its progeny. The resulting offspring are thus 
genetically  identical  to  a  single  parent.  Before  Mendel  started  working 
with  peas,  some  biologists  suspected  that  inheritance  might  work  that 
way in humans (Figure 19–18).
Although children resemble their parents, they are not carbon copies of 
either  the  mother  or  the  father.  Thanks  to  the  mechanisms  of  meiosis 
just described, sex breaks up existing collections of genetic information, 
shuffles alleles into new combinations, and produces offspring that tend

a small, perfectly formed human crouched 
inside the head of each sperm.

Figure 19–19 Some people taste it, 
some people don’t. the ability to taste 
the chemical phenylthiocarbamide (ptc)

geneticists have known since the 1930s that 
the inability to taste ptc is inherited, it was 
not until 2003 that researchers identified the 
responsible gene, which encodes a bitter-
taste receptor. Nontasters produce a ptc 
receptor protein that contains amino acid 
substitutions that are thought to reduce the 
receptor’s activity.

to exhibit a mixture of traits derived from both parents, as well as novel 
ones. The ability to track characteristics that show some variation from 
one generation to the next enabled geneticists to begin to decipher the 
rules that govern heredity in sexually reproducing organisms. 

The simplest traits to follow are those that are easy to see or to meas-
ure. In humans, these include the tendency to sneeze when exposed to 
bright sun, whether a person’s earlobes are attached or pendulous, or the 
ability  to  detect  certain  odors  or  flavors  (Figure  19–19).  Of  course,  the 
laws of inheritance were not worked out by studying people with pendu-
lous earlobes, but by following traits in organisms that are easy to breed 
and that produce large numbers of offspring. Gregor Mendel, the father 
of  genetics,  focused  on  peas.  But  similar  breeding  experiments  can  be 
performed in fruit flies, worms, dogs, cats, or any other plant or animal 
that possesses characteristics of interest, because the same basic laws 
of inheritance apply to all sexually reproducing organisms, from peas to 
people.

In this section, we describe the logic of genetic inheritance in sexually 
reproducing organisms. We see how the behavior of chromosomes dur-
ing meiosis—their segregation into gametes that then unite at random to 
form  genetically  unique  offspring—explains  the  experimentally  derived 
laws of inheritance. But first, we discuss how Mendel, breeding peas in 
his monastery garden, discovered these laws more than 150 years ago. 

Mendel Studied Traits That Are Inherited in a Discrete 
Fashion 
Mendel chose to study pea plants because they are easy to cultivate in 
large numbers and could be raised in a small space—such as an abbey 
garden. He controlled which plants mated with which by removing sperm 
(pollen)  from  one  plant  and  brushing  it  onto  the  female  structures  of 
another. This careful cross-pollination ensured that Mendel could be cer-
tain of the parentage of every pea plant he examined.

Perhaps more important for Mendel’s purposes, pea plants were available 
in many varieties. For example, one variety has purple flowers, another 
has white. One variety produces seeds (peas) with smooth skin, another 
produces peas that are wrinkled. Mendel chose to follow seven traits—
such as flower color and pea shape—that were distinct, easily observable, 
and, most importantly, inherited in a discrete fashion: for example, the 
plants have either purple flowers or white flowers—nothing in between 
(Figure 19–20). 

Mendel Disproved the Alternative Theories of Inheritance
The breeding experiments that Mendel performed were straightforward. 
He started with stocks of genetically pure, “true-breeding” plants—those 
that produce offspring of the same variety when allowed to self-fertilize. 
If he followed pea color, for example, he used plants with yellow peas 
that always produced offspring with yellow peas, and plants with green 
peas that always produced offspring with green peas.

Mendel’s  predecessors  had  focused  on  organisms  that  varied  in  mul-
tiple  traits.  These  investigators  often  wound  up  trying  to  characterize 
offspring  whose  appearance  differed  in  such  a  complex  way  that  they 
could  not  easily  be  compared  with  their  parents.  But  Mendel  took  the 
unique approach of studying each trait one at a time. In a typical experi-
ment,  he  would  cross-pollinate  two  of  his  true-breeding  varieties.  He 
then recorded the inheritance of the chosen trait in the next generation. 
For example, Mendel crossed plants producing yellow peas with plants 
producing green peas and discovered that the resulting hybrid offspring,

called the first filial, or F1, generation, all had yellow peas (Figure 19–21). 
He obtained a similar result for every trait he followed: the F1 hybrids all 
resembled only one of their two parents. 
Had Mendel stopped there—observing only the F1 generation—he might 
have developed some mistaken ideas about the nature of heredity: these 
results  appear  to  support  the  theory  of  uniparental  inheritance,  which 
states  that  the  appearance  of  the  offspring  will  match  one  parent  or 
the other (see, for example, Figure 19–18). Fortunately, Mendel took his 
breeding experiments to the next step: he crossed the F1 plants with one 
another (or allowed them to self-fertilize) and examined the results.

ECB4 e19.18/19.20

Mendel’s Experiments Revealed the Existence of 
Dominant and Recessive Alleles 
One  look  at  the  offspring  of  Mendel’s  initial  cross-fertilization  experi-
ments, such as those shown in Figure 19–21, raises an obvious question: 
what happened to the traits that disappeared in the F1 generation? Did 
the plants bearing green peas, for example, fail to make a genetic con-
tribution to their offspring? To find out, Mendel allowed the F1 plants to 
self-fertilize. If the trait for green peas had been lost, then the F1 plants 
would produce only plants with yellow peas in the next, F2, generation. 
Instead, he found that the “disappearing trait” returned: although three-
quarters of the offspring in the F2 generation had yellow peas, one-quarter 
had green peas (Figure 19–22). Mendel saw the same type of behavior for 
each of the other six traits he examined. 

To account for these observations, Mendel proposed that the inheritance 
of traits is governed by hereditary factors (which we now call genes) and 
that these factors come in alternative versions that account for the vari-
ations seen in inherited characteristics. The gene dictating pea color, for 
example, exists in two “flavors”—one that directs the production of yellow 
peas and one that directs production of green peas. Such alternative ver-
sions of a gene are now called alleles, and the whole collection of alleles 
possessed by an individual—its genetic makeup—is called its genotype.

Figure 19–20 Mendel studied seven traits 
that are inherited in a discrete fashion. 
For each trait, the plants display either 
one variation or the other, with nothing in 
between. as we will see shortly, one form of 
each trait is dominant, whereas the other is 
recessive.

ECB4 e19.19bottom/19.22

Mendel’s major conceptual breakthrough was to propose that for each 
characteristic, an organism must inherit two copies, or alleles, of each 
gene—one  from  its  mother  and  one  from  its  father.  The  true-breeding 
parental  strains,  he  theorized,  each  possessed  a  pair  of  identical  alle-
les—the  yellow-pea  plants  possessed  two  alleles  for  yellow  peas,  the 
green-pea plant two alleles for green peas. An individual that possesses 
two identical alleles is said to be homozygous for that trait. The F1 hybrid 
plants, on the other hand, had received two dissimilar alleles—one speci-
fying yellow peas and the other green. These plants were heterozygous 
for the trait of interest.

The appearance, or phenotype, of the organism depends on which ver-
sions of each allele it inherits. To explain the disappearance of a trait in 
the  F1  generation—and  its  reappearance  in  the  F2  generation—Mendel 
supposed that for any pair of alleles, one allele is dominant and the other 
is recessive, or hidden. The dominant allele, whenever it is present, would 
dictate  the  plant’s  phenotype.  In  the  case  of  pea  color,  the  allele  that 
specifies yellow peas is dominant; the green-pea allele is recessive. 

One  important  consequence  of  heterozygosity,  and  of  dominance  and 
recessiveness, is that not all of the alleles that an individual carries can 
be detected in its phenotype. Humans have about 30,000 genes, and each 
of us is heterozygous for a very large number of these. Thus, we all carry 
a great deal of genetic information that remains hidden in our personal 
phenotype but that can turn up in future generations.

Each gamete Carries a Single Allele for Each Character 
Mendel’s theory—that for every gene, an individual inherits one copy from 
its mother and one copy from its father—raised some logistical issues. If 
an organism has two copies of every gene, how does it pass only one 
copy of each to its progeny? And how do these gene sets come together 
again in the resulting offspring?

Mendel postulated that when sperm and eggs are formed, the two copies 
of each gene present in the parent separate so that each gamete receives 
only one allele for each trait. For his pea plants, each egg (ovum) and 
each sperm (pollen) receives only one allele for pea color (either yellow 
or green), one allele for pea shape (smooth or wrinkled), one allele for 
flower color (purple or white), and so on. During fertilization, sperm car-
rying one or other allele unites with an egg carrying one or other allele to 
produce a fertilized egg or zygote with two alleles. Which type of sperm 
unites with which type of egg at fertilization is entirely a matter of chance.

This  principle  of  heredity  is  laid  out  in  Mendel’s  first  law,  the  law  of 
segregation. It states that the two alleles for each trait separate (or seg-
regate)  during  gamete  formation  and  then  unite  at  random—one  from 
each parent—at fertilization. According to this law, the F1 hybrid plants 
with yellow peas will produce two classes of gametes: half the gametes 
will get a yellow-pea allele and half will get a green-pea allele. When the 
hybrid  plants  self-pollinate,  these  two  classes  of  gametes  will  unite  at 
random. Thus, four different combinations of alleles can come together 
in the F2 offspring (Figure 19–23). One-quarter of the F2 plants will receive 
two  alleles  specifying  green  peas;  these  plants  will  obviously  produce 
green peas. One-quarter of the plants will receive two yellow-pea alle-
les and will produce yellow peas. But one-half of the plants will inherit 
one allele for yellow peas and one allele for green. Because the yellow 
allele is dominant, these plants—like their heterozygous F1 parents—will 
all produce yellow peas. All told, three-quarters of the offspring will have 
yellow peas and one-quarter will have green peas. Thus Mendel’s law of 
segregation explains the 3:1 ratio that he observed in the F2 generation.

Figure 19–23 Parent plants produce gametes that each contain 
one allele for each trait; the phenotype of the offspring depends 
on which combination of alleles it receives. here we see both the 
genotype and phenotype of the pea plants that were bred in the 
experiments illustrated in Figures 19–21 and 19–22. the true-breeding 
yellow-pea plants produce only Y-bearing gametes; the true-breeding 
green plants produce only y gametes. the F1 offspring of a cross 
between these parents all produce yellow peas, and they have the 
genotype Yy. When these hybrid plants are bred with each other, 75% 
of the offspring have yellow peas, 25% have green. the gray box at 
the bottom, called a punnett square after a British mathematician who 
was a follower of Mendel, allows one to track the segregation of alleles 
during gamete formation and to predict the outcomes of breeding 
experiments like the one outlined in Figure 19–22. according to the 
system invented by Mendel, capital letters indicate a dominant allele 
and lowercase letters a recessive allele.

Mendel’s Law of Segregation Applies to All Sexually 
Reproducing Organisms
Mendel’s law of segregation explained the data for every trait he exam-
ined  in  pea  plants,  and  he  replicated  his  basic  findings  with  corn  and 
beans. But his rules governing inheritance are not limited to plants: they 
apply to all sexually reproducing organisms (Figure 19–24).

Consider a phenotype in humans that reflects the action of a single gene. 
The  major  form  of  albinism—Type  II  albinism—is  a  rare  condition  that 
is inherited in a recessive manner in many animals, including humans. 
Like the pea plants that produce green seeds, albinos are homozygous 
recessive: their genotype is aa. The dominant allele of the gene (denoted 
A) encodes an enzyme involved in making melanin, the pigment respon-
sible for most of the brown and black color present in hair, skin, and the 
retina of the eye. Because the recessive allele codes for a version of this 
enzyme that is only weakly active or completely inactive, albinos have 
white hair, white skin, and pupils that look pink because a lack of mela-
nin in the eye allows the red color of the hemoglobin in blood vessels in 
the retina to be visible. 

The  trait  for  albinism  is  inherited  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other 
recessive  trait,  including  Mendel’s  green  peas.  If  a  Type  II  albino  man 
(genotype aa) has children with a Type II albino woman (also aa), all of 
their children will be albino (aa). However, if a nonalbino man (AA) mar-
ries and has children with an albino woman (aa), their children will all be 
heterozygous (Aa) and normally pigmented (Figure 19–25). If two nonal-
bino individuals with an Aa genotype start a family, each of their children 
would have a 25% chance of being an albino (aa).

Of course, humans generally don’t have families large enough to guaran-
tee accurate Mendelian ratios. (Mendel arrived at his ratios by breeding

and counting thousands of pea plants for most of his crosses.) Geneticists 
that  follow  the  inheritance  of  specific  traits  in  humans  get  around  this 
problem by working with large numbers of families—or with several gen-
erations of a few large families—and preparing pedigrees that show the 
phenotype  of  each  family  member  for  the  relevant  trait.  Figure  19–26 
shows the pedigree for a family that harbors a recessive allele for deaf-
ness. It also illustrates an important practical consequence of Mendel’s

children that are homozygous for a deleterious recessive mutation.

Alleles for Different Traits Segregate Independently
Mendel  deliberately  simplified  the  problem  of  heredity  by  starting  with 
breeding  experiments  that  focused  on  the  inheritance  of  one  trait  at  a 
time,  called monohybrid crosses.  He  then  turned  his  attention  to  multi-
hybrid crosses, examining the simultaneous inheritance of two or more 
apparently unrelated traits. 

In the simplest situation, a dihybrid cross, Mendel followed the inherit-
ance of two traits at once: for example, pea color and pea shape. In the 
case  of  pea  color,  we  have  already  seen  that  yellow  is  dominant  over

Figure 19–26 a pedigree shows the risks 
of first-cousin marriages. Shown here is an 
actual pedigree for a family that harbors a 
rare recessive mutation causing deafness. 
according to convention, squares represent 
males, circles are females. here, family 
members that show the deaf phenotype are 
indicated by a blue symbol, those that do 
not by a gray symbol. a black horizontal line 
connecting a male and female represents a 
mating between unrelated individuals, and 
a red horizontal line represents a mating 
between blood relatives. the offspring of 
each mating are shown underneath, in order 
of their birth from left to right. 
   Individuals within each generation are 
labeled sequentially from left to right for 
purposes of identification. In the third 
generation in this pedigree, for example, 
individual 2, a man who is not deaf, marries 
his first cousin, individual 3, who is also 
not deaf. three out of their five children 
(individuals 7, 8, and 9 in the fourth 
generation) are deaf. Meanwhile, individual 
1, the brother of 2, also marries a first 
cousin, individual 4, the sister of 3. two out 
of their five children are deaf. (adapted from

green; for pea shape, round is dominant over wrinkled (see Figure 19–20). 
What would happen when plants that differ in both of these characters 
are crossed? Again, Mendel started with true-breeding parental strains: 
the dominant strain produced yellow round peas (its genotype is YYRR), 
the recessive strain produced green wrinkled peas (yyrr). One possibility 
is  that  the  two  characters,  pea  color  and  shape,  would  be  transmitted 
from  parents  to  offspring  as  a  linked  package.  In  other  words,  plants 
would always produce either yellow round peas or green wrinkled ones. 
The other possibility is that pea color and shape would be inherited inde-
pendently, which means that at some point plants that produce a novel 
mix of traits—yellow wrinkled peas or green round peas—would arise.
The  F1  generation  of  plants  all  showed  the  expected  phenotype:  each 
produced peas that were yellow and round. But this result would occur 
whether or not the parental alleles were linked. When the F1 plants were 
then allowed to self-fertilize, the results were clear: the two alleles for 
seed color segregated independently from the two alleles for seed shape, 
producing four different pea phenotypes: yellow-round, yellow-wrinkled, 
green-round, and green-wrinkled (Figure 19–27). Mendel tried his seven 
pea  characters  in  various  pairwise  combinations  and  always  observed 
a characteristic 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The inde-
pendent segregation of each pair of alleles during gamete formation is 
Mendel’s second law—the law of independent assortment.

Figure 19–27 a dihybrid (two trait) cross 
demonstrates that alleles can segregate 
independently. alleles that segregate 
independently are packaged into gametes 
in all possible combinations. So the Y allele 
is equally likely to be packaged with the  
R or r allele during gamete formation; and 
the same holds true for the y allele. thus 
four classes of gametes are produced in 
roughly equal numbers: YR, Yr, yR, and 
yr. When these gametes are allowed to 
combine at random to produce the  
F2 generation, the resulting pea phenotypes 
are yellow-round, yellow-wrinkled, green-
round, and green-wrinkled in a ratio of 
9:3:3:1.

The Behavior of Chromosomes During Meiosis underlies 
Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance
So  far  we  have  discussed  alleles  and  genes  as  if  they  are  disembod-
ied  entities.  We  now  know  that  Mendel’s  “factors”—the  things  we  call 
genes—are carried on chromosomes that are parceled out during the for-
mation of gametes and then brought together in novel combinations in 
the zygote at fertilization. Chromosomes therefore provide the physical 
basis for Mendel’s laws, and their behavior during meiosis and fertiliza-
tion—which we discussed earlier—explains these laws perfectly.

During  meiosis,  the  maternal  and  paternal  homologs—and  the  genes 
that  they  contain—pair  and  then  separate  from  each  other  as  they  are 
parceled  out  into  gametes.  These  maternal  and  paternal  chromosome 
copies will possess different variants—or alleles—of many of the genes 
they carry. Take, for example, a pea plant that is heterozygous for the yel-
low-pea gene (Yy). During meiosis, the chromosomes bearing the Y and y 
alleles will be separated, producing two types of haploid gametes—ones 
that contain a Y allele and others that contain a y. In a plant that self-
fertilizes,  these  haploid  gametes  come  together  to  produce  the  diploid 
individuals of the next generation—which may be YY, Yy, or yy. Together, 
the meiotic mechanisms that distribute the alleles into gametes and the 
combining of gametes at fertilization provide the physical foundation for 
Mendel’s law of segregation. 

But what about independent assortment of multiple traits? Because each 
pair of duplicated homologs attaches to the spindle and lines up at the 
metaphase plate independently during meiosis, each gamete will inherit 
a  random  mixture  of  paternal  and  maternal  chromosomes  (see  Figure 
19–15A). Thus the alleles of genes on different chromosomes will segre-
gate independently.

Consider a pea plant that is heterozygous for both seed color (Yy) and 
seed shape (Rr). The homolog pair carrying the color alleles will attach 
to the meiotic spindle with a certain orientation: whether the Y-bearing 
homolog  or  its  y-bearing  counterpart  is  captured  by  the  microtubules 
from one pole or the other depends on which way the bivalent happens 
to  be  facing  at  the  moment  of  attachment  (Figure  19–28).  The  same 
is  true  for  the  homolog  pair  carrying  the  alleles  for  seed  shape.  Thus, 
whether the final gamete receives the YR, Yr, yR, or yr allele combination 
depends entirely on which way the two homolog pairs were facing when 
they were captured by the meiotic spindle; each outcome has the same 
degree of randomness as the tossing of a coin.

Even genes on the Same Chromosome Can Segregate 
Independently by Crossing-Over

Mendel  studied  seven  traits,  each  of  which  is  controlled  by  a  separate 
gene.  It  turns  out  that  most  of  these  genes  are  located  on  different 
chromosomes,  which  readily  explains  the  independent  segregation  he 
observed.  But  the  independent  segregation  of  different  traits  does  not 
necessarily  require  that  the  responsible  genes  lie  on  different  chromo-
somes. If two genes are far enough away from each other on the same 
chromosome, they will also sort independently, because of the crossing-
over that occurs during meiosis. As we discussed earlier, when duplicated 
homologs  pair  to  form  bivalents,  the  maternal  and  paternal  homologs 
always undergo crossing-over. This genetic exchange can separate alle-
les that were formerly together on the same chromosome, causing them 
to  segregate  into  different  gametes  (Figure  19–29).  We  now  know,  for

laws of segregation and independent 
assortment. here we show independent 
assortment of the alleles for seed color, 
yellow (Y) and green (y), and for seed shape, 
round (R) and wrinkled (r), as an example of 
how two genes on different chromosomes 
segregate independently. although 
crossovers are not shown, they would not 
affect the independent assortment of these 
traits, as the two genes lie on different 
chromosomes.

example, that the genes for pea shape and pod color that Mendel studied 
are located on the same chromosome, but because they are far apart they 
segregate independently.

Not  all  genes  segregate  independently  as  per  Mendel’s  second  law.  If 
genes lie close together on a chromosome, they are likely to be inherited 
as a unit. For example, human genes associated with red–green color-
blindness and hemophilia are typically inherited together for this reason. 
By  measuring  how  frequently  genes  are  co-inherited,  geneticists  can 
determine whether they reside on the same chromosome and, if so, how 
far apart they are. These measurements of genetic linkage have been used 
to map the relative positions of the genes on each chromosome of many 
organisms. Such genetic maps have been crucial for isolating and char-
acterizing mutant genes responsible for human genetic diseases such as 
cystic fibrosis.

Figure 19–29 Genes that lie far enough 
apart on the same chromosome will 
segregate independently. (a) Because 
several crossover events occur randomly 
along each chromosome during prophase 
of meiosis I, two genes on the same 
chromosome will obey Mendel’s law of 
independent assortment if they are far 
enough apart. thus, for example, there is 
a high probability of crossovers occurring 
in the long region between C/c and F/f, 
meaning that a gamete carrying the F allele 
will wind up with the c allele as often as it 
will the C allele. In contrast, the A/a and 
B/b genes are close together, so there 
is only a small chance of crossing-over 
between them: thus the A allele is likely to 
be co-inherited with the B allele, and the a 
allele with the b allele. From the frequency 
of recombination, one can estimate the 
distances between the genes. (B) an

they have on gene function. Mutations that reduce or eliminate the activ-
ity of a gene are called loss-of-function mutations (Figure 19–30). An 
organism in which both alleles of a gene bear loss-of-function mutations 
will  generally  display  an  abnormal  phenotype—one  that  differs  from 
the most commonly occurring phenotype (although the difference may 
sometimes be subtle and hard to detect). By contrast, the heterozygote, 
which  possesses  one  mutant  allele  and  one  normal,  “wild-type”  allele, 
generally makes enough active gene product to function normally and 
retain a normal phenotype. Thus loss-of-function mutations are usually 
recessive, because—for most genes—decreasing the normal amount of 
gene product by 50% has little impact. 

ECB4 e19.26/19.30

In the case of Mendel’s peas, the gene that dictates seed shape codes for 
an  enzyme  that  helps  convert  sugars  into  branched  starch  molecules. 
The dominant, wild-type allele, R, produces an active enzyme; the reces-
sive,  mutant  allele,  r,  does  not.  Because  they  lack  this  enzyme,  plants 
that are homozygous for the r allele contain more sugar and less starch 
than plants that possess the dominant R allele, which gives their peas a 
wrinkled appearance (see Figure 19–20). The sweet peas available in the 
supermarket are often wrinkled mutants of the same type that Mendel 
studied.

Mutations  that  increase  the  activity  of  a  gene  or  its  product,  or  result 
in the gene being expressed in inappropriate circumstances, are called 
gain-of-function  mutations  (see  Figure  19–30).  Such  mutations  are 
usually dominant. For example, as we saw in Chapter 16, certain muta-
tions in the Ras gene generate a form of the protein that is always active. 
Because the normal Ras protein is involved in controlling cell prolifera-
tion, the mutant protein drives cells to multiply inappropriately, even in 
the absence of signals that are normally required to stimulate cell divi-
sion—thereby  promoting  the  development  of  cancer.  About  30%  of  all 
human  cancers  contain  such  dominant,  gain-of-function  mutations  in 
the Ras gene.

Each of us Carries Many potentially Harmful Recessive 
Mutations
As we saw in Chapter 9, mutations provide the fodder for evolution. They 
can alter the fitness of an organism, making it either less or more likely for 
the individual to survive and leave progeny. Natural selection determines 
whether  these  mutations  are  preserved:  those  that  confer  a  selective 
advantage on an organism tend to be perpetuated, while those that com-
promise an organism’s fitness or ability to procreate tend to be lost. 

The  great  majority  of  chance  mutations  are  either  neutral,  with  no 
effect on phenotype, or deleterious. A deleterious mutation that is domi-
nant—one that exerts its negative effects when present even in a single 
copy—will be eliminated almost as soon as it arises. In an extreme case, 
if a mutant organism is unable to reproduce, the mutation that causes 
that  failure  will  be  lost  from  the  population  when  the  mutant  individ-
ual dies. For deleterious mutations that are recessive, things are a little 
more  complicated.  When  such  a  mutation  first  arises,  it  will  generally

Imagine that each chromosome 
undergoes one and only one 
crossover event on each chromatid 
during each meiosis. How would

ends of the same chromosome

be present in only a single copy. The organism that caries the mutation 
can produce just as many progeny as other individuals; the majority of 
these progeny will inherit a single copy of the mutation, and they too will 
appear fit and healthy. But as they and their descendants begin to mate 
with one another, some individuals will inherit two copies of the mutant 
allele and display an abnormal phenotype. 

If  such  a  homozygous  individual  fails  to  reproduce,  two  copies  of  the 
mutant allele will be lost from the population. Eventually, an equilibrium 
is  reached,  where  the  rate  at  which  new  mutations  occur  in  the  gene 
balances the rate at which these mutant alleles are lost through matings 
that yield abnormal homozygous mutant individuals. As a consequence, 
many  deleterious  recessive  mutations  are  present  in  heterozygous 
individuals  at  a  surprisingly  high  frequency,  even  though  homozygous 
individuals showing the deleterious phenotype are rare. Thus the most 
common  form  of  hereditary  deafness  (due  to  mutations  in  a  gene  that 
encodes a gap-junction protein; see Figure 20–29) occurs in about one 
in 4000 births, but about one in 30 of us are carriers of a loss-of-function 
mutant allele of the gene. 

gENETICS AS AN EXpERIMENTAL TOOL
Our  understanding  of  how  chromosomes  shuttle  genetic  information 
from  one  generation  to  the  next  did  more  than  demystify  the  basis  of 
inheritance:  it  united  the  science  of  genetics  with  other  life  sciences, 
from cell biology and biochemistry to physiology and medicine. Genetics 
provides  a  powerful  way  to  discover  what  specific  genes  do  and  how 
variations in those genes underlie the differences between one species 
and  another  or  between  individuals  within  a  species.  Such  knowledge 
also has practical benefits, as understanding the genetic and biological 
basis of diseases can help us to better diagnose, treat, and prevent them.  

In  this  section,  we  outline  the  classical  genetic  approach  to  identifying 
genes and determining how they influence the phenotype of an experi-
mental  organism  such  as  yeast  or  flies.  The  process  begins  with  the 
generation of a very large number of mutants and the identification of 
those  rare  individuals  that  show  a  phenotype  of  interest.  By  analyzing 
these rare mutant individuals and their progeny, we can track down the 
genes  responsible  and  work  out  what  these  genes  normally  do—and 
how mutations that alter their activity affect how an organism looks and 
behaves. 

Modern  technologies—particularly  new  methods  for  obtaining  and 
comparing  genome  sequences—have  made  it  possible  to  analyze  the 
genotypes  of  large  numbers  of  individuals,  including  humans.  In  the 
final part of this section, we discuss how analyses of DNA collected from 
human families and populations all over the world are providing clues 
about  our  evolutionary  history  and  about  the  genes  that  influence  our 
susceptibility to disease. 

The Classical genetic Approach Begins with Random 
Mutagenesis
Before the advent of recombinant DNA technology (discussed in Chapter 
10), most genes were identified and characterized by observing the proc-
esses disrupted when the gene was mutated. This type of analysis begins 
with  the  isolation  of  mutants  that  have  an  interesting  or  unusual  phe-
notype:  fruit  flies  that  have  white  eyes  or  curly  wings  or  that  become 
paralyzed  when  exposed  to  high  temperatures,  for  example.  Working 
backward from the abnormal phenotype, one then determines the change

in DNA that is responsible. This classical genetic approach—searching 
for mutant phenotypes and then isolating the responsible genes—is most 
easily  performed  in  “model  organisms”  that  reproduce  rapidly  and  are 
amenable  to  genetic  manipulation,  such  as  bacteria,  yeasts,  nematode 
worms, zebrafish, and fruit flies. A brief review of this classical approach 
is presented in Panel 19–1 (p. 669).

ECB4 e19.27/19.31

Although spontaneous mutants with interesting phenotypes can be found 
by combing through a collection of thousands or millions of organisms, 
the process can be made much more efficient by generating mutations 
artificially  with  agents  that  damage  DNA,  called  mutagens.  Different 
mutagens generate different types of DNA mutations (Figure 19–31). Not 
all mutations will lead to a noticeable change in phenotype. But by treat-
ing large numbers of organisms with mutagens, collections of mutants 
can  be  generated  quickly,  increasing  the  odds  of  finding  an  interesting 
phenotype, as we discuss next. 

genetic Screens Identify Mutants Deficient in Specific  
Cell processes
A genetic screen typically involves examining many thousands of muta-
genized individuals to find the few that show a specific altered phenotype 
of interest. To search for genes involved in cell metabolism, for example, 
one might screen mutagenized bacterial or yeast cells to pick out those 
that have lost the ability to grow in the absence of a particular amino acid 
or other nutrient. 

Even  genes  involved  in  complex  phenotypes,  such  as  social  behavior, 
can be identified by genetic screens in multicellular organisms. For exam-
ple, by screening for worms that feed alone rather than in clusters as do 
wild-type individuals, scientists identified and isolated a gene that affects 
this “social behavior” (Figure 19–32).

Advances  in  modern  technologies  have  made  it  possible  to  carry 
out  genome-wide,  high-throughput  genetic  screens  on  collections  of 

Figure 19–32 Genetic screens can be 
used to identify mutations that affect an

The greater the distance

chance that they will be

them. If two genes are thus

they are said to be separated on 
a chromosome by a genetic map

TWO GENES OR ONE?
Given two mutations that produce the same phenotype, how 
can we tell whether they are mutations in the same gene? 
If the mutations are recessive (as they most often are), the 
answer can be found by a complementation test.

In the simplest type of complementation test, an individual who 
is homozygous for one mutation is mated with an individual 
who is homozygous for the other. The phenotype of the 
offspring gives the answer to the question.

a convenient method for conducting 
genome-wide genetic screens. In this 
experiment, each well in this 96-well plate 
is filled with E. coli that produce a different

E. coli are a standard diet for C. elegans

rNa matches the nucleotide sequence of a 
single C. elegans gene, thereby inactivating 
it. about 10 worms are added to each

for several days, which gives the rNas time 
to inactivate their target genes—and the 
worms time to grow, mate, and produce 
offspring. the plate is then examined in 
a microscope, which can be controlled

the worms’ ability to survive, reproduce, 
develop, and behave. Shown here are wild-

individuals  in  which  nearly  all  of  the  protein-coding  genes  have  been 
individually  inactivated.  Moreover,  such  mutant  collections  can  often 
be  screened  using  automated  robots.  For  example,  investigators  have 
made  use  of  RNA  interference  (explained  in  Figure  10–34)  to  generate 
nematode worms in which the activity of every protein-coding gene has 
been disrupted, with each worm being deficient in just one gene. These 
collections can be rapidly screened for dramatic changes in phenotype, 
such as stunted growth, uncoordinated movement, decreased fertility, or 
impaired embryonic development (Figure 19–33). Using this strategy, the 
genes needed for a particular characteristic can be identified.

Conditional Mutants permit the Study of Lethal Mutations 
Genetic screens are a powerful approach for isolating and characterizing 
mutations that are compatible with life—those that change the appear-
ance  or  behavior  of  an  organism  without  killing  it.  A  problem  arises, 
however, if we wish to study essential genes—those that are absolutely 
required for fundamental cell processes, such as RNA synthesis or cell 
division. Defects in these genes are usually lethal, which means that spe-
cial strategies are needed to isolate and propagate such mutants: if the 
mutants cannot be bred, their genes cannot be studied.

If the organism is diploid—a mouse or a pea plant, say—and the mutant 
phenotype  is  recessive,  there  is  a  simple  solution.  Individuals  that  are 
heterozygous for the mutation will have a normal phenotype and can be 
propagated. When they are mated with one another, 25% of the progeny 
will be homozygous mutants and will show the lethal mutant phenotype; 
50% will be heterozygous carriers of the mutation like their parents and 
can maintain the breeding stock. 

But what if the organism is haploid, as is the case for many yeast and 
bacteria? One way to study lethal mutations in such organisms makes 
use  of  conditional  mutants,  in  which  the  protein  product  of  the  mutant 
gene is only defective under certain conditions. For example, in mutants 
that  are  temperature-sensitive,  the  protein  functions  normally  within  a

certain  range  of  temperatures  (called  the  permissive  temperature)  but 
can be inactivated by a shift to a nonpermissive temperature outside this 
range. Thus the abnormal phenotype can be switched on and off simply 
by changing the temperature. A cell containing a temperature-sensitive 
mutation in an essential gene can be propagated at the permissive tem-
perature and then be driven to display its mutant phenotype by a shift to 
a nonpermissive temperature (Figure 19–34).

Many temperature-sensitive bacterial mutants were isolated to identify 
the genes that encode the bacterial proteins required for DNA replication; 
investigators  treated  large  populations  of  bacteria  with  mutagens  and 
then screened for cells that stopped making DNA when they were warmed 
from 30°C to 42°C. Similarly, temperature-sensitive yeast mutants were 
used to identify many of the proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle 
(see How We Know, pp. 30–31) and in transporting proteins through the 
secretory pathway (see Figure 15–28).

A Complementation Test Reveals Whether Two Mutations 
Are in the Same gene
A large-scale genetic screen can turn up many mutant organisms with 
the  same  phenotype.  These  mutations  might  affect  the  same  gene  or 
they might affect different genes that function in the same process. How 
can we distinguish between the two? If the mutations are recessive and 
cause a loss of function, a complementation  test can reveal whether 
they affect the same or different genes.

In the simplest type of complementation test, an individual that is homo-
zygous  for  one  recessive  mutation  is  mated  with  an  individual  that  is 
homozygous for the other mutation. If the two mutations affect the same 
gene, the offspring will show the mutant phenotype, because they carry 
only defective copies of the gene in question. If, in contrast, the muta-
tions affect different genes, the resulting offspring will show the normal, 
wild-type phenotype, because they will have one normal copy (and one 
mutant copy) of each gene (see Panel 19–1, p. 669). 

Whenever  the  normal  phenotype  is  restored  in  such  a  test,  the  alleles 
inherited from the two parents are said to complement each other (Figure 
19–35). For example, complementation tests on mutants identified dur-
ing genetic screens have revealed that 5 genes are required for yeast cells 

Figure 19–35 a complementation test can reveal that mutations 
in two different genes are responsible for the same abnormal 
phenotype. When an albino (white) bird from one strain is bred with 
an albino from a different strain, the resulting offspring have normal 
coloration. this restoration of the wild-type plumage implies that the 
two white breeds lack color because of recessive mutations in different 
genes. (From W. Bateson, Mendel’s Principles of Heredity, 1st ed.

Figure 19–34 Temperature-sensitive 
mutants are valuable for identifying 
the genes and proteins involved 
in essential cell processes. In this 
example, yeast cells are treated with 
a mutagen, spread on a culture plate 
at a relatively cool temperature, 
and allowed to proliferate to form 
colonies. the colonies are then 
transferred to two identical petri 
plates using a technique called 
replica plating. One of these plates is 
incubated at a cool temperature, the 
other at a warmer temperature. those 
cells that contain a temperature-
sensitive mutation in a gene essential 
for proliferation can be readily 
identified, because they divide at the 
cooler permissive temperature—but 
fail to divide at the warmer non-
permissive temperature.

Rapid and Cheap DNA Sequencing Has Revolutionized 
Human genetic Studies
Genetic  screens  in  model  experimental  organisms  have  been  spec-
tacularly  successful  in  identifying  genes  and  relating  them  to  various 
phenotypes, including many that are conserved between these organisms 
and humans. But the same approach cannot be used in humans. Unlike 
flies, worms, yeast, and bacteria, humans do not reproduce rapidly, and 
intentional mutagenesis in humans is out of the question. Moreover, an 
individual with a serious defect in an essential process such as DNA repli-
cation would die long before birth—before we can assess the phenotype. 

Nonetheless,  humans  are  becoming  increasingly  attractive  subjects  for 
genetic studies. Because the human population is so large, spontaneous, 
nonlethal mutations have arisen in all human genes—many times over. 
A substantial proportion of these remain in the genomes of present-day 
humans. The most deleterious of these mutations are discovered when 
the mutant individuals call attention to themselves by seeking medical 
help—a uniquely human behavior. 

With  the  recent  advances  that  have  enabled  the  sequencing  of  entire 
human genomes cheaply and quickly, we can now identify such muta-
tions  and  study  their  evolution  and  inheritance  in  ways  that  were 
impossible even a few years ago. By comparing the sequences of thou-
sands of human genomes from all around the world, we can now identify 
directly the DNA differences that distinguish one individual from another. 
These differences hold clues to our evolutionary origins and can be used 
to explore the roots of disease.

Linked Blocks of polymorphisms Have Been passed Down 
from Our Ancestors 
When we compare the sequences of multiple human genomes, we find 
that  any  two  individuals  will  differ  in  about  1  nucleotide  pair  in  1000. 
Most of these variations are common and relatively harmless. When two 
sequence variants coexist in the population and are both common, the 
variants are called polymorphisms. The majority of polymorphisms are 
due to the substitution of a single nucleotide, called single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms  or  SNPs  (Figure  19–36).  The  rest  are  due  largely  to 
insertions or deletions—called indels when the change is small, or copy 
number variants (CNVs) when it is large.

Although these common variants can be found throughout the genome, 
they  are  not  scattered  randomly—or  even  independently.  Instead,  they 
tend to travel in groups called haplotype blocks—combinations of poly-
morphisms or other DNA markers that are inherited as a unit.

QuESTION 19–4

When two individuals from different 
isolated, inbred subpopulations of 
a species come together and mate, 
their offspring often show “hybrid 
vigor”: that is, they appear more 
robust, healthy, and fertile than 
either parent. Can you suggest 
a possible explanation for this 
phenomenon?

Figure 19–36 Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) are sites in the 
genome where two or more alternative 
choices of a nucleotide are common in 
the population. Most such variations in the 
human genome occur at locations where 
they do not significantly affect a gene’s 
function.

To understand why such haplotype blocks exist, we need to consider our 
evolutionary history. It is thought that modern humans expanded from 
a  relatively  small  population—perhaps  around  10,000  individuals—that 
existed in Africa about 60,000 years ago. Among that small group of our 
ancestors, some individuals will have carried one set of genetic variants, 
others  a  different  set.  The  chromosomes  of  a  present-day  human  rep-
resent a shuffled combination of chromosome segments from different 
members of this small ancestral group of people. Because only about two 
thousand  generations  separate  us  from  them,  large  segments  of  these 
ancestral chromosomes have passed from parent to child, unbroken by 
the crossover events that occur during meiosis. (Remember, only a few 
crossovers  occur  between  each  set  of  homologous  chromosomes  (see 
Figure 19–12).)

As a result, certain sets of DNA sequences—and their associated poly-
morphisms—have  been  inherited  in  linked  groups,  with  little  genetic 
rearrangement across the generations. These are the haplotype blocks. 
Like genes that exist in different allelic forms, haplotype blocks also come 
in  a  limited  number  of  variants  that  are  common  in  the  human  popu-
lation, each representing a combination of DNA polymorphisms passed 
down from a particular ancestor long ago. 

Our genome Sequences provide Clues to our Evolutionary 
History
A  detailed  examination  of  haplotype  blocks  has  provided  intriguing 
insights into the history of human populations. New alleles of genes are 
continually being generated by mutation; many of these variants will be 
neutral, in that they will not affect the reproductive success of the indi-
vidual. These have a chance of becoming common in the population. The 
more time that has elapsed since the origin of a relatively common allele 
like a SNP, the smaller should be the haplotype block that surrounds it: 
over  the  course  of  many  generations,  crossover  events  will  have  had 
many chances to separate an ancient allele from other polymorphisms 
nearby. Thus by comparing the sizes of haplotype blocks from different 
human  populations,  it  is  possible  to  estimate  how  many  generations 
have elapsed since the origin of a specific neutral mutation. Combining 
such  genetic  comparisons  with  archaeological  findings,  scientists  have 
traced our history from that small set of ancestors and deduce the most 
probable routes our ancestors took when they left Africa (Figure 19–37).

More recent studies, comparing the genome sequences of living humans 
with those of Neanderthals and another extinct relation from southern 
Siberia,  suggest  that  our  exit  from  Africa  was  a  bit  more  convoluted. 
Some of us share a few percent of our nucleotide sequences with these

two alternative routes that our ancestors 
seem to have taken out of africa. Studies 
of the size of haplotype blocks suggest 
that modern europeans are descended

existed about 30,000 to 50,000 years ago. 
haplotype blocks in a Nigerian population 
are significantly smaller, indicating that the 
Nigerian population was established before 
the european. these findings agree with 
archaeological findings, which suggest that 
the ancestors of modern native australians

(migration routes not shown)—reached 
their destinations about 45,000 years ago.

archaic  humans,  suggesting  that  a  number  of  our  ancestors  interbred 
with their neighbors as they made their way across the globe.   

Genome analyses can also be used to estimate when and where humans 
acquired mutations that have conferred an evolutionary benefit, such as 
resistance to infection. Such favorable mutations will rapidly accumulate 
in the population because individuals that carry it will be more likely to 
survive an epidemic and pass the mutation on to their offspring. A hap-
lotype analysis can be used to “date” the appearance of such a favorable 
mutation. If it cropped up in the population relatively recently, there will 
have been fewer opportunities for recombination to break up the DNA 
sequence around it, so the surrounding haplotype block will be large. 

Such is the case for two alleles that confer resistance to malaria. These 
alleles are widespread in Africa, where malaria is rife. They are embedded 
in unusually large haplotype blocks, suggesting that they arose recently 
in the African gene pool—probably about 2500 years ago for one of them 
and about 6500 years ago for the other. In this way, analyses of modern 
human genomes can highlight important events in ancient human his-
tory, including our initial exposures to specific infections. 

polymorphisms Can Aid the Search for Mutations 
Associated with Disease
The study of polymorphisms may also have more practical relevance to 
human health. CNVs, indels, and SNPs can be used as markers for build-
ing human genetic maps or for conducting searches for mutations that 
predispose individuals to a specific disease. Mutations that give rise, in a 
reproducible way, to rare but clearly defined abnormalities, such as albi-
nism or congenital deafness, can often be identified by studies of affected 
families. Such single-gene, or monogenic, disorders are often referred to 
as Mendelian because their pattern of inheritance is as easy to track as 
the wrinkled peas and purple flowers that were studied by Mendel. But for 
many common diseases, the genetic roots are more complex. Instead of 
a single allele of a single gene, such disorders stem from a combination 
of  contributions  from  multiple  genes.  For  these  multigenic  conditions, 
such as diabetes or arthritis, population studies are often helpful in track-
ing down the genes that increase the risk of getting the disease. 

In  population  studies,  investigators  collect  DNA  samples  from  a  large 
number of people who have the disease and compare them to samples 
from a group of people who do not have the disease. They look for vari-
ants—SNPs, for example—that are more common among the people who 
have the disease. Because DNA sequences that are close together on a 
chromosome  tend  to  be  inherited  together,  the  presence  of  such  SNPs 
could indicate that an allele that increases the risk of the disease might 
lie  nearby  (Figure  19–38).  Although,  in  principle,  the  disease  could  be 
caused by the SNP itself, the culprit is much more likely to be a change 
that is merely linked to the SNP.
Such  genome-wide  association  studies—which 
initially  focused  on 
SNPs—have  been  used  to  search  for  genes  that  predispose  individuals 
to common diseases, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, rheu-
matoid  arthritis,  and  even  depression.  One  such  study  is  described  in 
how  We  Know  (pp.  676–677).  For  many  of  these  conditions,  environ-
mental as well as genetic factors play an important part in determining 
susceptibility.  Disappointingly,  most  of  the  DNA  polymorphisms  identi-
fied  increase  the  risk  of  disease  only  slightly.  But  by  providing  insights 
into  the  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  common  disorders,  these 
results—and newer, more powerful ways of analyzing the differences in 
human populations—should eventually lead to better approaches to dis-
ease treatment and prevention.

genomics Is Accelerating the Discovery of Rare Mutations 
that predispose us to Serious Disease
ECB4 e19.32/19.37
The genetic variants that have thus far allowed us to track our ancestors 
and identify some of the genes that increase our risk of disease are com-
mon  ones.  They  arose  long  ago  in  our  evolutionary  past  and  are  now 
present, in one form or another, in a substantial portion (1% or more) of 
the  population.  Such  polymorphisms  are  thought  to  account  for  about 
90% of the differences between one person’s genome and another. But 
when we try to tie these common variants to differences in disease sus-
ceptibility or other heritable traits, such as height, we find that they do not 
have as much predictive power as we had anticipated: thus, for example, 
most confer relatively small increases—less than twofold—in the risk of 
developing a common disease.

In  contrast  to  polymorphisms,  rare  DNA  variants—those  much  less 
frequent  in  humans  than  SNPs—can  have  large  effects  on  the  risk  of 
developing some common diseases. For example, a number of different 
loss-of-function  mutations,  each  individually  rare,  have  been  found  to 
increase greatly the predisposition to autism and schizophrenia. Many of 
these are de novo mutations, which arose spontaneously in the germ-line 
cells  of  one  or  other  parent.  The  fact  that  these  mutations  arise  spon-
taneously with some frequency could help explain why these common 
disorders—each observed in about 1% of the population—remain with us, 
even though the affected individuals leave few or no descendants. These 
rare  mutations,  which  may  arise  in  any  one  of  hundreds  of  different 
genes,  can  greatly  increase  the  risk  of  autism  and  schizophrenia—and 
could explain much of their clinical variability. Because they are kept rare 
by natural selection, most such variants with a large effect on risk would 
be missed by genome-wide association studies. 

Now that the price of DNA sequencing has plummeted, the most efficient 
and  cost-effective  way  to  identify  these  rare,  large-effect  mutations  is 
by sequencing all the exons (the exome)—or even the whole genomes—
of affected individuals, along with those of their parents and siblings as 
controls. Although exome sequencing will miss the noncoding variations 
that  affect  gene  regulation,  the  majority  of  rare,  large-effect  mutations 
have thus far been found to lie within exons; common, small-effect vari-
ations, by contrast, have been found mainly in noncoding sequences.

Figure 19–38 Genes that affect the 
risk of developing a common disease 
can often be tracked down through 
linkage to SNPs. here, the patterns 
of SNps are compared between two 
sets of individuals—a set of healthy 
controls and a set affected by a particular 
common disease. a segment of a 
typical chromosome is shown. For most 
polymorphic sites in this segment, it is 
a random matter whether an individual 
has one SNp variant (red vertical bars) or 
another (blue vertical bars); and the same 
randomness is seen both for the control 
group and for the affected individuals. 
however, in the part of the chromosome 
that is shaded in darker gray, a bias is seen, 
such that most normal individuals have the 
blue SNp variants, whereas most affected 
individuals have the red SNp variants. 
this suggests that this region contains, 
or is close to, a gene that is genetically 
linked to these red SNp variants and that 
predisposes to the disease. Using carefully 
selected controls and thousands of affected 
individuals, this approach can help track 
down disease-related genes, even when 
they confer only a slight increase in the risk 
of developing the disease. 

QuESTION 19–5

In a recent automated analysis, 
thousands of SNps across the 
genome were analyzed in pooled 
DNA samples from humans who had 
been sorted into groups according 
to their age. For the vast majority of 
these sites, there was no change in 
the relative frequencies of different 
variants as these humans aged. 
Sometimes, albeit rarely, a particular 
variant at one position was found to 
decrease in frequency progressively 
for people over 50 years old. Which 
of the possible explanations seems 
most likely?
A.  The nucleotide in that SNp 
at that position is unstable, and 
mutates with age.
B.  Those people born more than  
50 years ago came from a 
population that tended to lack the 
disappearing SNp variant.
C.  The SNp variant alters an 
important gene product in a way 
that shortens the human life-span, or 
is linked to a neighboring allele that 
has this effect.

hOW WE KNOW
USING SNPs TO GET a haNDLE ON hUMaN DISEaSE

For diseases that have their roots in genetics, finding the 
gene or genes responsible can be the first step toward 
improved  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  even  prevention. 
The  task  is  not  simple,  but  having  access  to  polymor-
phisms such as SNPs can help. In 1999, an international 
group of scientists set out to collect and catalog 300,000 
SNPs—the  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  that  are 
common  in  the  human  population  (see  Figure  19–36). 
Today, the database has grown to include a catalog of 
more  than  17  million  SNPs.  These  SNPs  not  only  help 
to  define  the  differences  between  one  individual  and 
another;  for  geneticists,  they  also  serve  as  signposts 
that  can  point  the  way  toward  the  genes  involved  in 
common  human  disorders,  such  as  diabetes,  obesity, 
asthma,  arthritis,  and  even  gallstones  and  restless  leg 
syndrome.

Making a map
One  way  that  SNPs  have  facilitated  the  search  for 
alleles  that  predispose  to  disease  is  by  providing  the 
physical  markers  needed  to  construct  detailed  genetic 
linkage maps. A genetic linkage map displays the rela-
tive  locations  of  a  set  of  genes.  Such  maps  are  based 

on  the  frequency  with  which  two  alleles  are  co-inher-
ited—something  we  can  discover  by  seeing  how  often 
the phenotypic traits associated with those alleles show 
up  together  in  an  individual.  Genes  that  lie  close  to 
one  another  on  the  same  chromosome  will  be  inher-
ited together much more frequently than those that lie 
farther  apart.  By  determining  how  often  crossing-over 
separates  two  genes,  the  relative  distance  between 
them can be calculated (see Panel 19–1, p. 669).

The same sort of analysis can be used to discover link-
age between a SNP and an allele. One simply looks for 
co-inheritance of the SNP with a certain phenotype, such 
as an inherited disease. Finding such a linkage indicates 
that the mutation responsible for the phenotype is either 
the SNP itself or, more likely, that lies close to the SNP 
(Figure 19–39). And because we know the exact loca-
tion  in  the  human  genome  sequence  of  every  SNP  we 
examine, the linkage tells us the neighborhood in which 
the causative mutation resides. A more detailed analysis 
of the DNA in that region—to look for deletions, inser-
tions,  or  other  functionally  significant  abnormalities  in 
the  DNA  sequence  of  affected  individuals—can  then 
lead to a precise identification of the critical gene.

TESTS PERFORMED ON 7 CHILDREN

Disease is seen only in progeny with SNP genotype aa.
CONCLUSION:   Recessive mutation causing the disease is co-inherited with SNP a. If this same 
correlation is observed in other families that have been examined, the mutation causing the disease 
must lie close to SNP a.

Figure 19–39 SNP analysis can pin down the location of a mutation that causes a genetic disease. In this approach, one studies 
the co-inheritance of a specific human phenotype (here a genetic disease) with a particular set of SNps. the figure shows the logic for 
the common case of a family in which both parents are carriers of a recessive mutation. If individuals with the disease, and only such 
individuals, are homozygous for a particular SNp, then the SNp and the recessive mutation that causes the disease are likely to be close 
together on the same chromosome, as shown here. to prove that an apparent linkage is statistically significant, a few dozen individuals 
from such families may need to be examined. With more individuals and using more SNps, it is possible to locate the mutation more 
precisely. these days it can be just as fast and cheap to use whole-genome sequencing to find the mutation.

Such  linkage  analyses  are  usually  carried  out  in  fami-
lies that are particularly prone to a disorder—the larger 
the family, the better. And the method works best where 
there is a simple cause-and-effect relationship, such that 
a particular mutant gene directly and reliably causes the 
disorder—as  is  the  case,  for  example,  for  the  mutant 
gene that causes cystic fibrosis. But most common dis-
orders are not like this. Instead, many factors affect the 
disease risk—some genetic, some environmental, some 
just a matter of chance. For such conditions, a different 
approach is needed to identify risk genes. 

Making associations 
Genome-wide  association  studies  allow  us  to  discover 
common genetic variants that affect the risk for a com-
mon  disease,  even  if  each  variant  alters  susceptibility 
only slightly. Because mutations that destroy the activ-
ity  of  a  key  gene  are  likely  to  have  a  disastrous  effect 
on the fitness of the mutant individual, they tend to be 
eliminated from the population by natural selection and 
so are rarely seen. Genetic variants that alter a gene’s 
function only slightly, on the other hand, are much more 
common. By tracking down these common variants, or 
polymorphisms, we can sniff out some of the genes that 
contribute to the biology of common diseases.

Genome-wide association studies use genetic markers, 
such as SNPs, that are located throughout the genome 
to  compare  directly  the  DNA  sequences  of  two  popu-
lations:  individuals  who  have  a  particular  disease  and 
those who do not. The approach identifies SNPs that are 
present in the people who have the disease more often 
than would be expected by chance. 

Consider  the  case  of  age-related  macular  degenera-
tion (AMD), a degenerative disorder of the retina that is 
a  leading  cause  of  blindness  in  the  elderly.  To  search 
for  genetic  variations  that  are  associated  with  AMD, 
researchers looked at a panel of just over 100,000 SNPs 
that spanned the genome. They determined the nucle-
otide sequence at each of these SNPs in 96 people who 
had AMD, and 50 who did not. Among the 100,000 SNPs, 
they  discovered  that  one  particular  SNP  was  present 
significantly more often in the individuals who had the 
disease (Figure 19–40). 
The SNP is located in a gene called Cfh (complement fac-
tor H). But it falls within one of the gene’s introns and 
appears unlikely to have any effect on the protein prod-
uct. This SNP itself, therefore, did not seem likely to be 
the cause of the increase in susceptibility to AMD. But 
it  focused  the  researchers’  attention  on  the  Cfh  gene. 
So  they  resequenced  the  region  to  look  for  additional 
polymorphisms that might also be inherited more often 
by people with AMD, along with the SNP that they had 

already  identified.  They  discovered  three  variants  that 
affect the amino acid sequence of the Cfh protein. One 
substitutes  a  histidine  for  a  tyrosine  at  one  particu-
lar place in the protein, and it was strongly associated 
with  the  disease  (and  almost  always  coupled  with  the 
original SNP that had put the researchers on the track 
of the Cfh gene). Individuals who carried two copies of 
this risky allele were five to seven times more likely to 
develop AMD than those who harbored a different allele 
of the Cfh gene.

Several  other  research  teams,  using  a  similar  genetic 
association approach, have also pointed to Cfh variants 
as increasing the likelihood of developing AMD, making 
it almost certain that the Cfh gene has something to do 
with the biology of the disease. The Cfh protein is part 
of the complement system; it helps prevent the system 
from  becoming  overactive,  a  condition  that  can  lead 
to  inflammation  and  tissue  damage.  Interestingly,  the 
environmental risk factors associated with the disease—
smoking, obesity, and age—also affect inflammation and 
the activity of the complement system. Thus, whatever 
the  detailed  mechanism  by  which  the  Cfh  gene  influ-
ences the risk of AMD, the finding that complement is 
critical  could  lead  to  new  tests  for  the  early  diagnosis 
of  the  disorder,  as  well  as  potential  new  avenues  for 
treatment.

ChaPTER 19     Sexual reproduction and the power of Genetics

Exome and genome sequencing efforts are turning up many previously 
unreported  genetic  variants—in  both  disease  and  apparently  healthy 
populations. One recent study suggests that we all harbor about 100 loss-
of-function  mutations  in  protein-coding  genes—20  of  which  eliminate 
the activity of both gene copies—indicating that humans do not actually 
need all of our genes to develop and function as “normal.”

ESSENTIAL CONCEpTS

•	 Sexual	 reproduction	 involves	 the	 cyclic	 alternation	 of	 diploid	 and	
haploid states: diploid germ-line cells divide by meiosis to form hap-
loid gametes, and the haploid gametes from two individuals fuse at 
fertilization to form a new diploid cell—the zygote.

•	 During	 meiosis,	 the	 maternal	 and	 paternal	 homologs	 are	 parceled	
out  to  gametes  such  that  each  gamete  receives  one  copy  of  each 
chromosome.  Because  the  segregation  of  these  homologs  occurs 
randomly, and crossing-over occurs between them, many genetically 
different gametes can be produced from a single individual. 

•	

In	addition	to	enhancing	genetic	mixing,	crossing-over	helps	ensure	
the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis.

•	 Although	most	of	the	mechanical	features	of	meiosis	are	similar	to	
those of mitosis, the behavior of the chromosomes is different: meio-
sis produces four genetically distinct haploid cells by two consecutive 
cell  divisions,  whereas  mitosis  produces  two  genetically  identical 
diploid cells by a single cell division. 

•	 Mendel	unraveled	the	laws	of	heredity	by	studying	the	inheritance	of	

a handful of discrete traits in pea plants. 

•	 Mendel’s	 law	 of	 segregation	 states	 that	 the	 maternal	 and	 paternal	
alleles for each trait separate from one another during gamete forma-
tion and then reunite randomly during fertilization.

•	 Mendel’s	law	of	independent	assortment	states	that,	during	gamete	
formation,  different  pairs  of  alleles  segregate  independently  of  one 
another.

•	 The	 behavior	 of	 chromosomes	 during	 meiosis	 explains	 both	 of	

Mendel’s	laws.	

•	

If	 two	 genes	 are	 close	 to	 each	 other	 on	 a	 chromosome,	 they	 tend	
to be inherited as a unit; if they are far apart, they will typically be 
separated	by	crossing-over.	The	frequency	with	which	two	genes	are	
separated by crossovers can be used to construct a genetic map that 
shows their order on a chromosome.

•	 Mutant	alleles	can	be	either	dominant	or	recessive.	If	a	single	copy	
of the mutant allele alters the phenotype of an individual that also 
possesses a wild-type allele, the mutant allele is dominant; if not, it 
is recessive.

•	 Complementation	tests	reveal	whether	two	mutations	that	produce	

the same phenotype affect the same gene or different genes.

•	 Mutant	organisms	can	be	generated	by	treating	animals	with	muta-
gens,	 which	 damage	 DNA.	 Such	 mutants	 can	 then	 be	 screened	 to	
identify phenotypes of interest and, ultimately, to isolate the respon-
sible genes.

•	 With	the	possible	exception	of	identical	twins,	no	two	human	genomes	
are	alike.	Each	of	us	carries	a	unique	set	of	polymorphisms—varia-
tions	 in	 nucleotide	 sequence	 that	 in	 some	 cases	 contribute	 to	 our	
individual phenotypes.

•	 Some	 of	 the	 common	 polymorphisms—including	 SNPs,	 indels,	 and	

CNVs—provide	useful	markers	for	genetic	mapping.

•	 The	human	genome	consists	of	large	haplotype	blocks—segments	of	
nucleotide	 sequence	 that	 have	 been	 passed	 down	 intact	 from	 our	
distant ancestors and, in most individuals, have not yet been broken 
up	by	crossovers.	The	relative	sizes	of	haplotype	blocks	can	give	us	
clues to our evolutionary history.

•	 DNA	sequencing	studies	are	identifying	an	increasing	number	of	rare	
mutations that can greatly increase the risk of developing the most 
common human disorders.

It is easy to see how deleterious mutations in bacteria, 
which have a single copy of each gene, are eliminated by 
natural selection: the affected bacteria die and the mutation 
is thereby lost from the population. Eukaryotes, however, 
have two copies of most genes—that is, they are diploid. 
Often an individual with two normal copies of the gene 
(homozygous normal) is indistinguishable in phenotype from 
an individual with one normal copy and one defective copy 
of the gene (heterozygous). In such cases, natural selection 
can operate only against an individual with two copies of 
the defective gene (homozygous defective). Consider the 
situation in which a defective form of the gene is lethal 
when homozygous, but without effect when heterozygous. 
Can such a mutation ever be eliminated from the population 
by natural selection? Why or why not?

Early genetic studies in Drosophila laid the foundation for 
our current understanding of genes. Drosophila geneticists 
were able to generate mutant flies with a variety of easily 
observable phenotypic changes. Alterations from the fly’s 
normal brick-red eye color have a venerable history because 
the very first mutant found by Thomas Hunt Morgan was 
a white-eyed fly (Figure Q19–18). Since that time, a large 
number of mutant flies with intermediate eye colors have 
been isolated and given names that challenge your color 
sense: garnet, ruby, vermilion, cherry, coral, apricot, buff, 
and carnation. The mutations responsible for these eye-
color phenotypes are all recessive. To determine whether 
the mutations affected the same or different genes, 
homozygous flies for each mutation were bred to one 
another in pairs and the eye colors of their progeny were 
noted. In Table Q19–18, a + or a – indicates the phenotype 
of the progeny flies produced by mating the fly listed at the

Cell Communities: tissues, 
Stem Cells, and Cancer

Cells  are  the  building  blocks  of  multicellular  organisms.  This  seems  a 
simple statement, but it raises deep problems. Cells are not like bricks: 
they are small and squishy. How can they be used to construct a giraffe 
or a giant redwood tree? Each cell is enclosed in a flimsy membrane less 
than a hundred-thousandth of a millimeter thick, and it depends on the 
integrity of this membrane for its survival. How, then, can cells be joined 
together robustly to form muscles that can lift an elephant’s weight? Most 
mysterious of all, if cells are the building blocks, where is the builder and 
where are the architect’s plans? How are all the different cell types in a 
plant or an animal produced, with each in its proper place in an elaborate 
pattern (Figure 20–1)? 

Most of the cells in multicellular organisms are organized into coopera-
tive assemblies called  tissues,  such as  the nervous, muscle, epithelial, 
and connective tissues found in vertebrates (Figure 20–2). In this chap-
ter, we begin by discussing the architecture of tissues from a mechanical 
point of view. We will see that tissues are composed not only of cells, 
with  their  internal  framework  of  cytoskeletal  filaments  (discussed  in 
Chapter 17), but also of extracellular matrix, which cells secrete around 
themselves; it is this matrix that gives supportive tissues such as bone or 
wood their strength. The matrix provides one way to bind cells together, 
but cells can also attach to one another directly. Thus, we also discuss 
the cell junctions that link cells together in the flexible, mobile tissues of 
animals. These junctions transmit forces either from the cytoskeleton of 
one cell to that of the next, or from the cytoskeleton of a cell to the extra-
cellular matrix.

Figure 20–1 Multicellular organisms are built from organized 
collections of cells. this section of cells in the urine-collecting ducts 
of the kidney was stained with a combination of dyes, hematoxylin 
and eosin, commonly used in histology. each duct is made of closely 
packed “principal” cells (with nuclei stained red ), which form an 
epithelial tube, seen here in cross section as a ring. the ducts are 
embedded in an extracellular matrix, stained purple and populated 
by other types of cells. (From p.r. Wheater et al., Functional histology, 
2nd ed. London: churchill Livingstone, 1987.)

But there is more to the organization of tissues than mechanics. Just as a 
building needs plumbing, telephone lines, and other fittings, so an animal 
tissue requires blood vessels, nerves, and other components formed from 
a variety of specialized cell types. All the tissue components have to be 
appropriately organized and coordinated, and many of them require con-
tinual maintenance and renewal. Cells die and have to be replaced with 
new cells of the right type, in the right places, and in the right numbers. 
In the third section of this chapter, we discuss how these processes are 
organized, as well as the crucial role that stem cells, self-renewing undif-
ferentiated cells, play in the renewal and repair of some tissues.

Disorders of tissue renewal are a major medical concern, and those due 
to the misbehavior of mutant cells underlie the development of cancer. 
We discuss cancer in the final section of this chapter and of the book as a 
whole. Its study requires a synthesis of knowledge of cells and tissues at 
every level, from the molecular biology of DNA repair to the principles of 
natural selection and the social organization of cells in tissues. Many fun-
damental advances in cell biology have been driven by cancer research, 
and basic cell biology in return continues to deepen our understanding of 
the disease and provide us with renewed optimism about its treatment.

extracellular matrix and connective 
tissues
Plants  and  animals  have  evolved  their  multicellular  organization  inde-
pendently,  and  their  tissues  are  constructed  on  different  principles. 
Animals prey on other living things—and often are preyed on by other 
animals—and for this they must be strong and agile: they must possess 
tissues  capable  of  rapid  movement,  and  the  cells  that  form  those  tis-
sues must be able to generate and transmit forces and to change shape 
quickly. Plants, by contrast, are sedentary: their tissues are more or less 
rigid, although their cells are weak and fragile if isolated from the sup-
porting matrix that surrounds them.

outer layers of cells, which have only primary 
cell walls (deposited while the cell is still 
growing). cellulose is more plentiful in the 
inner layers, which have thicker, more rigid 
secondary cell walls (deposited after cell 
growth has ceased). (B) cells and their walls 
are clearly seen in this electron micrograph 
of the young cells in the root of the same

those in the stem, as can be seen by the 
different scale bars in the two micrographs.

In plants, the supportive matrix is called the cell wall, a boxlike struc-
ture that encloses, protects, and constrains the shape of each of its cells 
(Figure 20–3). Plant cells themselves synthesize, secrete, and control the 
composition of this extracellular matrix: a cell wall can be thick and hard, 
as in wood, or thin and flexible, as in a leaf. But the principle of tissue 
construction is the same in either case: many tiny boxes are cemented 
together, with a delicate cell living inside each one. Indeed, as we noted 
in Chapter 1, it was the close-packed mass of microscopic chambers that 
Robert Hooke saw in a slice of cork three centuries ago that inspired the 
term “cell.”

Animal tissues are more diverse. Like plant tissues, they consist of both 
cells  and  extracellular  matrix,  but  these  components  are  organized  in 
many different ways. In some tissues, such as bone or tendon, extracel-
lular matrix is plentiful and mechanically all-important; in others, such as 
muscle or epidermis, extracellular matrix is scanty, and the cytoskeletons 
of the cells themselves carry the mechanical load. We begin with a brief 
discussion of plant cells and tissues, before considering those of animals.

Plant cells Have tough external Walls
A naked plant cell, artificially stripped of its wall, is a delicate and vul-
nerable thing. With care, it can be kept alive in culture; but it is easily 
ruptured, and even a small decrease in the osmotic strength of the cul-
ture medium can cause the cell to swell and burst. Its cytoskeleton lacks 
the tension-bearing intermediate filaments found in animal cells, and as 
a result, it has virtually no tensile strength. An external wall, therefore, 
is essential.

The plant cell wall has to be tough, but it does not necessarily have to 
be  rigid.  Osmotic  swelling  of  the  cell,  limited  by  the  resistance  of  the 
cell wall, can keep the chamber distended, and a mass of such swollen 
chambers cemented together forms a semirigid tissue. Such is the state 
of a crisp lettuce leaf (Figure 20–4). If water is lacking so that the cells 
shrink, the leaf wilts. 

Most newly formed cells in a multicellular plant initially make relatively 
thin  primary  cell  walls,  which  can  slowly  expand  to  accommodate  cell 
growth (see Figure 20–3B). The driving force for cell growth is the same

Figure 20–5 a scale model shows a 
portion of a primary plant cell wall. the 
green bars represent cellulose microfibrils, 
which provide tensile strength. Other 
polysaccharides (red strands) cross-
link the cellulose microfibrils, while the 
polysaccharide pectin (blue strands) fills the 
spaces between the microfibrils, providing 
resistance to compression. the middle 
lamella (yellow) is rich in pectin and is the 
layer that cements one cell wall to another.

as that keeping the lettuce leaf crisp—a swelling pressure, called the tur-
gor pressure, that develops as the result of an osmotic imbalance between 
the interior of the plant cell and its surroundings. Once cell growth stops 
and the wall no longer needs to expand, a more rigid secondary cell wall 
is often produced (see Figure 20–3A)—either by thickening of the primary 
wall or by deposition of new layers with a different composition under-
neath the old ones. When plant cells become specialized, they generally 
produce specially adapted types of walls: waxy, waterproof walls for the 
surface epidermal cells of a leaf; hard, thick, woody walls for the xylem 
cells of the stem; and so on. 

ECB4 e20.05/20.05

cellulose microfibrils Give the Plant cell Wall its tensile 
strength
Like all extracellular matrices, plant cell walls derive their tensile strength 
from long fibers oriented along the lines of stress. In higher plants, the 
long fibers are generally made from the polysaccharide cellulose, the most 
abundant organic macromolecule on Earth. These cellulose microfibrils 
are interwoven with other polysaccharides and some structural proteins, 
all bonded together to form a complex structure that resists both com-
pression and tension (Figure 20–5). In woody tissue, a highly cross-linked 
network of lignin (a complex polymer built from aromatic alcohol groups) 
is deposited within this matrix to make it more rigid and waterproof. 

For a plant cell to grow or change its shape, the cell wall has to stretch 
or deform. Because the cellulose microfibrils resist stretching, their ori-
entation governs the direction in which the growing cell enlarges: if, for 
example,  they  are  arranged  circumferentially  as  a  corset,  the  cell  will 
grow more readily in length than in girth (Figure 20–6). By controlling the 

Figure 20–6 the orientation of cellulose microfibrils within the 
plant cell wall influences the direction in which the cell elongates. 
the cells in (a) and (B) start off with identical shapes (shown here as 
cubes) but with different orientations of cellulose microfibrils in their 
walls. although turgor pressure is uniform in all directions, each cell 
tends to elongate in a direction perpendicular to the orientation of the 
microfibrils, which have great tensile strength. the final shape of an 
organ, such as a shoot, is determined by the direction in which its cells 
expand.

way that it lays down its wall, the plant cell consequently controls its own 
shape and thus the direction of growth of the tissue to which it belongs. 

Cellulose is produced in a radically different way from most other extra-
cellular macromolecules. Instead of being made inside the cell and then 
exported  by  exocytosis  (discussed  in  Chapter  15),  it  is  synthesized  on 
the  outer  surface  of  the  cell  by  enzyme  complexes  embedded  in  the 
plasma membrane. These complexes transport sugar monomers across 
the plasma membrane and incorporate them into a set of growing poly-
mer chains at their points of membrane attachment. Each set of chains 
assembles to form a cellulose microfibril. The enzyme complexes move 
in the membrane, spinning out new polymers and laying down a trail of 
oriented cellulose microfibrils behind them (Figure 20–7a). 

The paths followed by the enzyme complexes dictate the orientation in 
which cellulose is deposited in the cell wall; but what guides the enzyme 
complexes?  Just  underneath  the  plasma  membrane,  microtubules  are 
aligned  exactly  with  the  cellulose  microfibrils  outside  the  cell  (Figure 
20–7B). These microtubules serve as tracks that help guide the movement 
of the enzyme complexes (Figure 20–7C). In this curiously indirect way, 
the cytoskeleton controls the shape of the plant cell and the modeling of 
the plant tissues. We will see that animal cells use their cytoskeleton to 
control tissue architecture in a much more direct manner.

complexes are integral membrane proteins 
that continuously synthesize cellulose 
microfibrils on the outer face of the plasma

microfibrils become integrated into the

at the other end pushes the synthase 
complex along in the plane of the plasma

Figure 20–8 extracellular matrix is 
plentiful in connective tissue such as 
bone. In this micrograph, cells in a cross 
section of bone appear as small, dark, 
antlike objects embedded in the bone 
matrix, which occupies most of the volume 
of the tissue and provides all its mechanical 
strength. the alternating light and dark 
bands are layers of matrix containing 
oriented collagen fibrils (made visible 
with the help of polarized light). calcium 
phosphate crystals (not visible) filling the 
interstices between the collagen fibrils make 
bone matrix resistant to both compression 
and tension, like reinforced concrete.

animal connective tissues consist largely of extracellular 
matrix
It is traditional to distinguish four major types of tissues in animals: con-
nective,  epithelial,  nervous,  and  muscular.  But  the  basic  architectural 
distinction is between connective tissues and the rest. In connective tis-
sues,  extracellular  matrix  is  plentiful  and  carries  the  mechanical  load. 
In other tissues, such as epithelia, extracellular matrix is scanty, and the 
cells  are  directly  joined  to  one  another  and  carry  the  mechanical  load 
themselves. We discuss connective tissues first.

ECB4 e20.08/20.08

Animal connective tissues are enormously varied. They can be tough and 
flexible like tendons or the dermis of the skin; hard and dense like bone; 
resilient and shock-absorbing like cartilage; or soft and transparent like 
the jelly that fills the interior of the eye. In all these examples, the bulk of 
the tissue is occupied by extracellular matrix, and the cells that produce 
the matrix are scattered within it like raisins in a pudding (Figure 20–8). 
In  all  of  these  tissues,  the  tensile  strength—whether  great  or  small—is 
chiefly  provided  not  by  a  polysaccharide,  as  in  plants,  but  by  a  fibrous 
protein: collagen. The various types of connective tissues owe their spe-
cific characters to the type of collagen that they contain, to its quantity, 
and, most importantly, to the other molecules that are interwoven with it 
in varying proportions. These include the rubbery protein elastin, which 
gives the walls of arteries their resilience as blood pulses through them, 
as well as a host of specialized polysaccharide molecules, which we dis-
cuss shortly.

collagen Provides tensile strength in animal connective 
tissues
Collagen is a protein found in all animals, and it comes in many varieties. 
Mammals have about 20 different collagen genes, coding for the variant 
forms  of  collagen  required  in  different  tissues.  Collagens  are  the  chief 
proteins in bone, tendon, and skin (leather is pickled collagen), and they 
constitute 25% of the total protein mass in a mammal—more than any 
other type of protein.

The characteristic feature of a typical collagen molecule is its long, stiff, 
triple-stranded  helical  structure,  in  which  three  collagen  polypeptide

collagens often have detrimental 
consequences, resulting in severely 
crippling diseases. Particularly 
devastating are mutations that 
change glycines, which are required 
at every third position in the 
collagen polypeptide chain so that it 
can assemble into the characteristic 
triple-helical rod (see Figure 20–9).

chains  are  wound  around  one  another  in  a  ropelike  superhelix  (see 
Figure  4–29A).  Some  types  of  collagen  molecules  in  turn  assem-
ble  into  ordered  polymers  called  collagen  fibrils,  which  are  thin  cables 
10–300  nm  in  diameter  and  many  micrometers  long;  these  can  pack 
together into still thicker collagen fibers (Figure 20–9). Other types of col-
lagen molecules decorate the surface of collagen fibrils and link the fibrils 
to one another and to other components in the extracellular matrix. 

ECB4 e20.09/20.09

The connective-tissue cells that manufacture and inhabit the extracellular 
matrix go by various names according to the tissue: in skin, tendon, and 
many other connective tissues, they are called fibroblasts (Figure 20–10 
and see Figure 20–9); in bone, they are called osteoblasts. They make both 
the collagen and the other macromolecules of the matrix. Almost all of 
these molecules are synthesized intracellularly and then secreted in the 
standard way, by exocytosis (discussed in Chapter 15). Outside the cell, 
they assemble into huge, cohesive aggregates. If assembly were to occur 
prematurely,  before  secretion,  the  cell  would  become  choked  with  its 
own  products.  In  the  case  of  collagen,  the  cells  avoid  this  catastrophe 
by secreting collagen molecules in a precursor form, called procollagen, 
with additional peptide extensions at each end that obstruct premature 
assembly into collagen fibrils. Extracellular enzymes—called procollagen 
proteinases—cut  off  these  terminal  extensions  to  allow  assembly  only 
after  the  molecules  have  emerged  into  the  extracellular  space  (Figure 
20–11).

Some  people  have  a  genetic  defect  in  one  of  these  proteinases,  or  in 
procollagen itself, so that their collagen fibrils do not assemble correctly.

Figure 20–11 procollagen precursors are cleaved to form mature 
collagen outside the cell. collagen is synthesized as a procollagen 
molecule that has unstructured peptides at either end. these peptides 
prevent collagen from assembling into a fibril inside the fibroblast. 
When the procollagen is secreted, an extracellular enzyme removes 
its terminal peptides, producing mature collagen molecules. these 
molecules can then self-assemble into ordered collagen fibrils (see 
also Figure 20–9).

As a result, their connective tissues have a lower tensile strength and are 
extraordinarily stretchable (Figure 20–12).

Cells  in  tissues  have  to  be  able  to  degrade  matrix  as  well  as  make  it. 
This ability is essential for tissue growth, repair, and renewal; it is also 
important where migratory cells, such as macrophages, need to burrow 
through the thicket of collagen and other extracellular matrix polymers. 
Matrix proteases that cleave extracellular proteins play a part in many 
disease  processes,  ranging  from  arthritis,  where  they  contribute  to  the 
breakdown of cartilage in affected joints, to cancer, where they help can-
cer cells invade normal tissue.

cells organize the collagen that they secrete
To  do  their  job,  collagen  fibrils  must  be  correctly  aligned.  In  skin,  for 
example, they are woven in a wickerwork pattern, or in alternating layers 
with different orientations so as to resist tensile stress in multiple direc-
tions (Figure 20–13). In tendons, which attach muscles to bone, they are 
aligned in parallel bundles along the major axis of tension. 

The  connective-tissue  cells  that  produce  collagen  control  this  orienta-
tion, first by depositing the collagen in an oriented fashion and then by 
rearranging it. During development of the tissue, fibroblasts work on the 
collagen they have secreted, crawling over it and pulling on it—helping 
to compact it into sheets and draw it out into cables. This mechanical 
role of fibroblasts in shaping collagen matrices has been demonstrated 
dramatically  in  cell  culture.  When  fibroblasts  are  mixed  with  a  mesh-
work  of  randomly  oriented  collagen  fibrils  that  form  a  gel  in  a  culture 
dish, the fibroblasts tug on the meshwork, drawing in collagen from their 
surroundings and compacting it. If two small pieces of embryonic tissue 
containing fibroblasts are placed far apart on a collagen gel, the inter-
vening collagen becomes organized into a dense band of aligned fibers 
that connect the two explants (Figure 20–14). The fibroblasts migrate out 
from the explants along the aligned collagen fibers. Thus, the fibroblasts 
influence  the  alignment  of  the  collagen  fibers,  and  the  collagen  fibers 
in turn affect the distribution of the fibroblasts. Fibroblasts presumably 
play  a  similar  role  in  generating  long-range  order  in  the  extracellular 
matrix inside the body—in helping to create tendons, for example, and 
the  tough,  dense  layers  of  connective  tissue  that  ensheathe  and  bind 
together most organs. Fibroblast migration is also important for healing 
wounds (Movie 20.1).

Figure 20–12 Incorrect collagen assembly can cause the skin to 
be hyperextensible. James Morris, “the elastic skin man,” from a 
photograph taken in about 1890. abnormally stretchable skin is part 
of a genetic syndrome that results from a defect in collagen assembly. 
In some individuals, this condition arises from a lack of an enzyme that 
converts procollagen to collagen.

Figure 20–13 Collagen fibrils in skin are arranged in a plywoodlike 
pattern. the electron micrograph shows a cross section of tadpole 
skin. Successive layers of fibrils are laid down nearly at right angles to 
each other (see also Figure 20–9). this arrangement is also found in 
mature bone and in the cornea. (courtesy of Jerome Gross.) 

integrins couple the matrix outside a cell to the 
cytoskeleton inside it
If cells are to pull on the matrix and crawl over it, they must be able to 
attach to it. Cells do not attach well to bare collagen. Another extracellu-
lar matrix protein, fibronectin, provides a linkage: part of the fibronectin 
molecule binds to collagen, while another part forms an attachment site 
for a cell (Figure 20–15a and B). 

A cell attaches itself to fibronectin by means of a receptor protein, called 
an integrin, which spans the cell’s plasma membrane. When the extracel-
lular domain of the integrin binds to fibronectin, the intracellular domain 
binds (through a set of adaptor molecules) to an actin filament inside the 
cell (Figure 20–15C). Without this internal anchorage to the cytoskeleton, 
integrins  would  be  ripped  out  of  the  flimsy  lipid  bilayer  of  the  plasma 
membrane as the cell attempted to pull itself along the matrix. 

It is the formation and breakage of the attachments on either end of an 
integrin molecule that allows a cell to crawl through a tissue, grabbing 
hold of the matrix at its front end and releasing its grip at the rear (see 
Figure  17–33).  Integrins  coordinate  these  “catch-and-release”  manoeu-
vers  by  undergoing  remarkable  conformational  changes.  Binding  to 
a  molecule  on  one  side  of  the  plasma  membrane  causes  the  integrin 
molecule to stretch out into an extended, activated state so that it can 
then latch onto a different molecule on the opposite side—an effect that 
operates in either direction across the membrane (Figure 20–16). Thus, 
an  intracellular  signaling  molecule  can  activate  the  integrin  from  the 
cytosolic side, causing it to reach out and grab hold of an extracellular 
structure. Similarly, binding to an external structure can switch on intra-
cellular signaling pathways by activating protein kinases that associate 
with  the  intracellular  end  of  the  integrin.  In  this  way,  a  cell’s  external 
attachments  help  regulate  whether  it  lives  or  dies,  and—if  it  does  sur-
vive—whether it grows, divides, or differentiates.

Humans make at least 24 kinds of integrins, each of which recognizes 
distinct extracellular molecules and has distinct functions, depending on

elsewhere in the culture dish, the collagen

the cell type in which it resides. For example, the integrins on white blood 
cells help the cells crawl out of blood vessels at sites of infection so as 
to deal with marauding microbes. People who lack this type of integrin 
develop  a  disease  called  leucocyte  adhesion  deficiency  and  suffer  from 
repeated  bacterial  infections.  A  different  form  of  integrin  is  found  on 
blood platelets, and individuals who lack this integrin bleed excessively 
because their platelets cannot bind to the necessary clotting factor in the 
extracellular matrix.

Figure 20–16 an integrin protein 
switches to an active conformation when 
it binds to molecules on either side 
of the plasma membrane. an integrin 
protein consists of two different subunits, 
α (green) and β (blue), which can switch 
between a folded, inactive form and an 
extended, active form. the switch to the 
activated state can be triggered by binding 
to an extracellular matrix molecule (such 
as fibronectin) or to intracellular adaptor 
proteins that then link the integrin to the 
cytoskeleton (see Figure 20–15). In both 
cases, the conformational change alters 
the integrin so that its opposite end rapidly 
forms a counterbalancing attachment to 
the appropriate structure. In this way, the 
integrin creates a mechanical linkage across 
the plasma membrane. (Based on t. Xiao at

Figure 20–17 Glycosaminoglycans (GaGs) 
are built from repeating disaccharide 
units. hyaluronan, a relatively simple GaG, 
is shown here. It consists of a single long 
chain of up to 25,000 repeated disaccharide 
units, each carrying a negative charge 
(red ). as in other GaGs, one of the sugar 
monomers (green) in each disaccharide 
unit is an amino sugar. Many GaGs have 
additional negatively charges, often from 
sulfate groups (not shown). 

animal tissues provides the complementary function, resisting compres-
sion.  These  are  the  glycosaminoglycans  (GAGs),  negatively  charged 
polysaccharide  chains  made  of  repeating  disaccharide  units  (Figure 
20–17).  GAGs  are  usually  covalently  linked  to  core  proteins  to  form 
proteoglycans, which are extremely diverse in size, shape, and chem-
istry. Typically, many GAG chains are attached to a single core protein, 
which may in turn be linked at one end to another GAG, creating an enor-
mous aggregate resembling a bottlebrush, with a molecular weight in the 
millions (Figure 20–18). 

ECB4 e20.16/20.17

In  dense,  compact  connective  tissues  such  as  tendon  and  bone,  the 
proportion of GAGs is small, and the matrix consists almost entirely of 
collagen  (or,  in  the  case  of  bone,  of  collagen  plus  calcium  phosphate 
crystals). At the other extreme, the jellylike substance in the interior of 
the eye consists almost entirely of one particular type of GAG, plus water,

Question 20–3

Proteoglycans are characterized by 
the abundance of negative charges 
on their sugar chains. How would 
the properties of these molecules 
differ if the negative charges were 
not as abundant?

with  only  a  small  amount  of  collagen.  In  general,  GAGs  are  strongly 
hydrophilic  and  tend  to  adopt  highly  extended  conformations,  which 
occupy  a  huge  volume  relative  to  their  mass  (see  Figure  20–18).  Thus 
GAGs act as effective “space fillers” in the extracellular matrix of connec-
tive tissues. 

Even at very low concentrations, GAGs form hydrophilic gels: their mul-
tiple  negative  charges  attract  a  cloud  of  cations,  such  as  Na+,  that  are 
osmotically active, causing large amounts of water to be sucked into the 
matrix. This gives rise to a swelling pressure, which is balanced by ten-
sion in the collagen fibers interwoven with the proteoglycans. When the 
matrix is rich in collagen and large quantities of GAGs are trapped in its 
meshes, both the swelling pressure and the counterbalancing tension are 
enormous.  Such  a  matrix  is  tough,  resilient,  and  resistant  to  compres-
sion. The cartilage matrix that lines the knee joint, for example, has this 
character: it can support pressures of hundreds of kilograms per square 
centimeter.

Proteoglycans perform many sophisticated functions in addition to pro-
viding hydrated space around cells. They can form gels of varying pore 
size and charge density that act as filters to regulate the passage of mol-
ecules through the extracellular medium. They can bind secreted growth 
factors  and  other  proteins  that  serve  as  extracellular  signals  for  cells. 
They can block, encourage, or guide cell migration through the matrix. 
In all these ways, the matrix components influence the behavior of cells, 
often the same cells that make the matrix—a reciprocal interaction that 
has important effects on cell differentiation and the arrangement of cells 
in a tissue. Much remains to be learned about how cells weave the tapes-
try of matrix molecules and how the chemical messages they deposit in 
this intricate biochemical fabric are organized and act.

ePitHelial sHeets and cell Junctions
There are more than 200 visibly different cell types in the body of a ver-
tebrate.  The  majority  of  these  are  organized  into  epithelia  (singular 
epithelium)—multicellular sheets in which the cells are joined together, 
side to side. In some cases, the sheet is many cells thick, or stratified, as 
in the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin); in other cases, it is a simple 
epithelium, only one cell thick, as in the lining of the gut. Epithelial cells 
can take many forms. They can be tall and columnar, squat and cuboi-
dal, or flat and squamous (Figure 20–19). Within a given sheet, the cells 
may be all the same type or a mixture of different types. Some epithelia, 
like  the  epidermis,  act  mainly  just  as  a  protective  barrier;  others  have 
complex biochemical functions. Some secrete specialized products such 
as  hormones,  milk,  or  tears;  others,  such  as  the  epithelium  lining  the 
gut, absorb nutrients; yet others detect signals, such as light, sensed by

the  epithelium  containing  the  auditory  hair  cells  in  the  ear  (see  Figure 
12–27).  Despite  these  and  many  other  variations,  one  can  recognize  a 
standard set of structural features that virtually all animal epithelia share. 
The arrangement of cells into epithelia is so commonplace that one eas-
ily takes it for granted; yet it requires a collection of specialized devices, 
as we will see, and these are common to a wide variety of epithelial cell 
types. 

Epithelia cover the external surface of the body and line all its internal 
cavities, and they must have been an early feature in the evolution of ani-
mals. Cells joined together into an epithelial sheet create a barrier, which 
has the same significance for the multicellular organism that the plasma 
membrane has for a single cell. It keeps some molecules in, and others 
out;  it  takes  up  nutrients  and  exports  wastes;  it  contains  receptors  for 
environmental signals; and it protects the interior of the organism from 
invading microorganisms and fluid loss. 

epithelial sheets are Polarized and rest on a Basal lamina
An epithelial sheet has two faces: the apical surface is free and exposed 
to the air or to a watery fluid; the basal surface is attached to a sheet 
of connective tissue called the basal lamina (Figure  20–20). The basal 
lamina consists of a thin, tough sheet of extracellular matrix, composed 
mainly  of  a  specialized  type  of  collagen  (type  IV  collagen)  and  a  pro-
tein  called  laminin  (Figure  20–21).  Laminin  provides  adhesive  sites  for 
integrin molecules in the basal plasma membranes of epithelial cells, and 
it  thus  serves  a  linking  role  like  that  of  fibronectin  in  other  connective 
tissues.

The  apical  and  basal  faces  of  an  epithelium  are  chemically  different, 
reflecting  the  polarized  organization  of  the  individual  epithelial  cells: 
each  has  a  top  and  a  bottom,  with  different  properties  and  functions. 
This polarity is crucial for epithelial function. Consider, for example, the 
simple columnar epithelium that lines the small intestine of a mammal. 
It mainly consists of two intermingled cell types: absorptive cells, which

because of the brushlike mass of microvilli 
on their apical surface; the microvilli serve 
to increase the area of apical plasma

take  up  nutrients,  and  goblet  cells  (so  called  because  of  their  shape), 
which secrete the mucus that protects and lubricates the gut lining (Figure

molecules  from  the  gut  lumen  through  their  apical  surface  and  export 
these molecules from their basal surface into the underlying tissues. To 
do this, absorptive cells require different sets of membrane transport pro-
teins in their apical and basal plasma membranes (see Figure 12–14). The 
goblet cells also have to be polarized, but in a different way: they have to 
synthesize mucus and then discharge it from their apical end only (see 
Figure 20–22); their Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, and cytoskeleton 
are all polarized so as to bring this about. For both types of epithelial cells 
polarity depends on the junctions that the cells form with one another 
and with the basal lamina. These in turn control the arrangement of an 
elaborate system of membrane-associated intracellular proteins that cre-
ate the polarized organization of the cytoplasm.

tight Junctions make an epithelium leak-proof and 
separate its apical and Basal surfaces
Epithelial  cell  junctions  can  be  classified  according  to  their  function. 
Some  provide  a  tight  seal  to  prevent  the  leakage  of  molecules  across 
the epithelium through the gaps between its cells; some provide strong 
mechanical attachments; and some provide for a special type of intimate 
chemical communication. In most epithelia, all these types of junctions 
are present. As we will see, each type of junction is characterized by its 
own class of membrane proteins.

The sealing function is served (in vertebrates) by tight junctions. These 
junctions seal neighboring cells together so that water-soluble molecules 
cannot  easily  leak  between  them.  If  a  tracer  molecule  is  added  to  one 
side of an epithelial cell sheet, it will usually not pass beyond the tight 
junction (Figure 20–23a and B). The tight junction is formed from pro-
teins called claudins and occludins, which are arranged in strands along 
the lines of the junction to create the seal (Figure 20–23C). Without tight

as barriers to solute diffusion. (a) Schematic drawing showing how a

junctions to prevent leakage, the pumping activities of absorptive cells 
such as those in the gut would be futile, and the composition of the extra-
cellular  fluid  would  become  the  same  on  both  sides  of  the  epithelium. 
ECB4 e20.23/20.23
Tight  junctions  also  play  a  key  part  in  maintaining  the  polarity  of  the 
individual epithelial cells in two ways. First, the tight junctions around 
the  apical  region  of  each  cell  prevents  diffusion  of  proteins  within  the 
plasma membrane and so keeps the apical domain of the plasma mem-
brane different from the basal (or basolateral) domain (see Figure 11–32). 
Second, in many epithelia, the tight junctions are sites of assembly for the 
complexes of intracellular proteins that govern the apico-basal polarity 
of the cell interior. 

cytoskeleton-linked Junctions Bind epithelial cells 
robustly to one another and to the Basal lamina
The cell junctions that hold an epithelium together by forming mechanical 
attachments are of three main types. Adherens junctions and desmosomes 
bind one epithelial cell to another, while hemidesmosomes bind epithe-
lial cells to the basal lamina. All of these junctions provide mechanical 
strength by the same strategy: the proteins that form the cell adhesion 
span the plasma membrane and are linked inside the cell to cytoskeletal 
filaments. In this way, the cytoskeletal filaments are tied into a network 
that extends from cell to cell across the whole expanse of the epithelial 
sheet.

Adherens junctions and desmosomes are both built around transmem-
brane proteins that belong to the cadherin family: a cadherin molecule 
in the plasma membrane of one cell binds directly to an identical cad-
herin molecule in the plasma membrane of its neighbor (Figure 20–24). 

698 

Chapter 20     cell communities: tissues, Stem cells, and cancer

Figure 20–24 Cadherin molecules mediate 
mechanical attachment of one cell to 
another. Identical cadherin molecules in the 
plasma membranes of adjacent cells bind 
to each other extracellularly; inside the cell, 
they are attached, via linker proteins, to 
cytoskeletal filaments—either actin filaments 
or keratin intermediate filaments. as cells 
touch one another, their cadherins become 
concentrated at the point of attachment 
(movie 20.2).

Such binding of like-to-like is called homophilic binding. In the case of 
cadherins, binding also requires that Ca2+ be present in the extracellular 
medium—hence the name. 

ECB4 e20.24/20.24

At an adherens junction, each cadherin molecule is tethered inside its 
cell,  via  several  linker  proteins,  to  actin  filaments.  Often,  the  adherens 
junctions form a continuous adhesion belt around each of the interact-
ing epithelial cells; this belt is located near the apical end of the cell, just 
below the tight junctions (Figure 20–25). Bundles of actin filaments are 
thus connected from cell to cell across the epithelium. This network of 
actin  filaments  can  contract,  giving  the  epithelial  sheet  the  capacity  to 
develop tension and to change its shape in remarkable ways. By shrink-
ing the apical surface of an epithelial sheet along one axis, the sheet can 
roll itself up into a tube (Figure 20–26a and B). Alternatively, by shrinking 
its apical surface locally along all axes at once, the sheet can invaginate 
into a cup and eventually create a spherical vesicle by pinching off from 
the rest of the epithelium (Figure 20–26C). Epithelial movements such as 
these are important in embryonic development, where they create struc-
tures such as the neural tube (see Figure 20–26B), which gives rise to the 
central  nervous  system,  and  the  lens  vesicle,  which  develops  into  the 
lens of the eye (see Figure 20–26C).

the apex of each cell. these bundles 
are linked to those in adjacent cells via 
transmembrane cadherin molecules (see 
Figure 20–24).

At a desmosome, a different set of cadherin molecules connects to kera-
tin  filaments—the  intermediate  filaments  found  specifically  in  epithelial 
cells (see Figure 17–5). Bundles of ropelike keratin filaments criss-cross 
the  cytoplasm  and  are  “spot-welded”  via  desmosome  junctions  to 
the  bundles  of  keratin  filaments  in  adjacent  cells  (Figure  20–27).  This 
arrangement  confers  great  tensile  strength  on  the  epithelial  sheet  and 
is characteristic of tough, exposed epithelia such as the epidermis of the 
skin.

Blisters are a painful reminder that it is not enough for epidermal cells 
to be firmly attached to one another: they must also be anchored to the 
underlying connective tissue. As we noted earlier, the anchorage is medi-
ated by integrins in the cells’ basal plasma membranes. The extracellular 
domains  of  these  integrins  bind  to  laminin  in  the  basal  lamina;  inside 
the cell, the integrin tails are linked to keratin filaments, creating a struc-
ture that looks superficially like half a desmosome. These attachments 

Figure 20–26 epithelial sheets can bend to form a tube 
or a vesicle. contraction of apical bundles of actin filaments 
linked from cell to cell via adherens junctions causes the 
epithelial cells to narrow at their apex. Depending on 
whether the contraction of the epithelial sheet is oriented 
along one axis, or is equal in all directions, the epithelium 
will either roll up into a tube or invaginate to form a vesicle.

is driven by an apical narrowing of epithelial cells in all 
directions. (B, courtesy of Jean-paul revel; c, courtesy

Question 20–4

analogs of hemidesmosomes are 
the focal contact sites described 
in chapter 17, which are also sites 
where the cell attaches to the 
extracellular matrix. these junctions 
are prevalent in fibroblasts but 
largely absent in epithelial cells. on 
the other hand, hemidesmosomes 
are prevalent in epithelial cells but 
absent in fibroblasts. in focal contact 
sites, intracellular connections are 
made to actin filaments, whereas 
in hemidesmosomes connections 
are made to intermediate filaments. 
Why do you suppose these two 
different cell types attach differently 
to the extracellular matrix?

of  epithelial  cells  to  basal  lamina  beneath  them  are  therefore  called 
hemidesmosomes (Figure 20–28). 

Gap Junctions allow cytosolic inorganic ions and  
small molecules to Pass from cell to cell
The final type of epithelial cell junction, found in virtually all epithelia and 
in many other types of animal tissues, serves a totally different purpose. 
In the electron microscope, this gap junction appears as a region where 
the membranes of two cells lie close together and exactly parallel, with 
a very narrow gap of 2–4 nm between them. The gap, however, is not 
entirely empty; it is spanned by the protruding ends of many identical, 
transmembrane protein complexes that lie in the plasma membranes of 
the two apposed cells. These complexes, called connexons, are aligned 
end-to-end to form narrow, water-filled channels across the two plasma 
membranes  (Figure  20–29a).  The  channels  allow  inorganic  ions  and 
small, water-soluble molecules (up to a molecular mass of about 1000 
daltons) to move directly from the cytosol of one cell to the cytosol of the 
other. This creates an electrical and a metabolic coupling between the 
cells. Gap junctions between cardiac muscle cells, for example, provide

Question 20–5

Gap junctions are dynamic structures 
that, like conventional ion channels, 
are gated: they can close by a 
reversible conformational change 
in response to changes in the cell. 
the permeability of gap junctions 
decreases within seconds, for 
example, when the intracellular ca2+ 
concentration is raised. speculate 
why this form of regulation might be 
important for the health of a tissue.

Gap junctions in many tissues can be opened or closed in response to 
extracellular or intracellular signals. The neurotransmitter dopamine, for 
example, reduces gap-junction communication within a class of neurons 
in the retina in response to an increase in light intensity (Figure 20–30). 
This reduction in gap-junction permeability alters the pattern of electri-
cal signaling and helps the retina switch from using rod photoreceptors, 
which  are  good  detectors  of  low  light,  to  cone  photoreceptors,  which 
detect color and fine detail in bright light. The function of gap junctions—
and  of  the  other  junctions  found  in  animal  cells—are  summarized  in 
Figure 20–31.

Plant tissues lack all the types of cell junctions we have discussed so far, 
as  their  cells  are  held  together  by  their  cell  walls.  Curiously,  however, 
they have a functional counterpart of the gap junction. The cytoplasms of 
adjacent plant cells are connected via minute communicating channels 
called  plasmodesmata,  which  span  the  intervening  cell  walls.  In  con-
trast to gap-junction channels, plasmodesmata are cytoplasmic channels 
lined  with  plasma  membrane  (Figure  20–32).  Thus  in  plants,  the  cyto-
plasm  is,  in  principle,  continuous  from  one  cell  to  the  next.  Inorganic  
small  molecules,  and  even  macromolecules—including  some  proteins 
and regulatory RNAs—can pass through plasmodesmata. The controlled 
traffic of transcription regulators and regulatory RNAs from one cell to 
another is important in plant development.

tissue maintenance and reneWal
One cannot contemplate the organization of tissues without wondering 
how these astonishingly patterned structures come into being. This ques-
tion  raises  an  even  more  challenging  one—a  puzzle  that  is  one  of  the 
most ancient and fundamental in all of biology: how is a complex multi-
cellular organism generated from a single fertilized egg?

ECB4 e20.22/20.31

In the process of development, the fertilized egg cell divides repeatedly to 
give a clone of cells—about 10,000,000,000,000 for a human—essentially 
all containing the same genome but specialized in different ways. This 
clone has a structure. It may take the form of a daisy or an oak tree, a sea 
urchin, a whale, or a mouse (Figure 20–33). The structure is determined 
by the genome that the fertilized egg contains. The linear sequence of A, 
G, C, and T nucleotides in the DNA directs the production of a variety of 
distinct cell types, each expressing different sets of genes and arranged 
in a precise, intricate, three-dimensional pattern, which self-assembles 
during development.

Although the final structure of an animal’s body may be enormously com-
plex, it is generated by a limited repertoire of cell activities. Examples of 
all these activities have been discussed in earlier pages of this book. Cells 
grow, divide, migrate, and die. They form mechanical attachments and 
generate forces that bind epithelial sheets. They differentiate by switch-
ing  on  or  off  the  production  of  specific  sets  of  proteins  and  regulatory

RNAs.  They  produce  molecular  signals  to  influence  neighboring  cells, 
and they respond to signals that neighboring cells deliver to them. They 
remember the effects of previous signals they have received, and so pro-
gressively become more and more specialized in the characteristics they 
adopt. The genome, identical in virtually every cell, defines the rules by 
which these various possible cell activities are called into play. Through 
its  operation  in  each  cell  individually,  the  genome  guides  the  whole 
intricate  process  by  which  a  multicellular  organism  is  generated  from 
a fertilized egg. Movies 1.1, 20.3, and 20.4 offer some visual examples 
of how development unfurls for the embryos of a frog, a fruit fly, and a 
zebrafish, respectively.

ECB4 e20.32/20.33

For  developmental  biologists,  the  challenge  is  to  explain  how  genes 
orchestrate the entire sequence of interlocking events that lead from the 
egg to the adult organism. We will not attempt to set out an answer to 
this  problem  here:  we  do  not  have  space  to  do  it  justice,  even  though 
a  great  deal  of  the  genetic  and  cell  biological  basis  of  development  is 
now understood. But the same basic activities that combine to create the 
organism  during  development  continue  even  in  the  adult  body,  where 
fresh cells are continually generated in precisely controlled patterns. It 
is this more limited topic that we discuss in this section, focusing on the 
organization and maintenance of the tissues of adult vertebrates. 

tissues are organized mixtures of many cell types
Although the specialized tissues in our body differ in many ways, they 
all have certain basic requirements, usually provided for by a mixture of 
cell types, as illustrated for the skin in Figure 20–34. As discussed earlier, 
all tissues need mechanical strength, which is often supplied by a sup-
porting framework of connective tissue inhabited by fibroblasts. In this 
connective  tissue,  blood  vessels  lined  with  endothelial  cells  satisfy  the 
need  for  oxygen,  nutrients,  and  waste  disposal.  Likewise,  most  tissues

are innervated by nerve-cell axons, which are ensheathed by Schwann 
cells  that  can  wrap  around  the  axons  to  provide  electrical  insulation. 
Macrophages  dispose  of  dead  and  damaged  cells  and  other  unwanted 
debris,  and  lymphocytes  and  other  white  blood  cells  combat  infection. 
Most of these cell types originate outside the tissue and invade it, either 
early in the course of its development (endothelial cells, nerve-cell axons, 
and  Schwann  cells)  or  continually  during  life  (macrophages  and  other 
white blood cells). 
A similar supporting apparatus is required to maintain the principal spe-
cialized cells of many tissues: the contractile cells of muscle, the secretory 
cells of glands, or the blood-forming cells of bone marrow, for example. 
Almost every tissue is therefore an intricate mixture of many cell types 
that must remain different from one another while coexisting in the same 
environment. Moreover, in almost all adult tissues, cells are continually 
dying and being replaced; throughout this hurly-burly of cell replacement 
and tissue renewal, the organization of the tissue must be preserved. 
Three main factors contribute to this stability. 

ECB4 e20.33/20.34

1.  Cell  communication:  each  type  of  specialized  cell  continually 
monitors its environment for signals from other cells and adjusts 
its  behavior  accordingly;  in  fact,  the  very  survival  of  most  cells 
depends  on  such  social  signals  (discussed  in  Chapter  16).  This 
communication ensures that new cells are produced and survive 
only when and where they are required.

2.  Selective  cell  adhesion:  because  different  cell  types  have  differ-
ent cadherins and other cell adhesion molecules in their plasma 
membrane, they tend to stick selectively, by homophilic binding, to 
other cells of the same type. They may also form selective attach-
ments to certain other cell types and to specific extracellular matrix 
components. The selectivity of these cell adhesions prevents the 
different cell types in a tissue from becoming chaotically mixed.

tissue Maintenance and renewal         

705

3.  Cell  memory:  as  discussed  in  Chapter  8,  specialized  patterns  of 
gene  expression,  evoked  by  signals  that  acted  during  embry-
onic development, are afterward stably maintained, so that cells 
autonomously preserve their distinctive character and pass it on to 
their progeny. A fibroblast divides to produce more fibroblasts, an 
endothelial cell divides to produce more endothelial cells, and so 
on. 

different tissues are renewed at different rates
Tissues vary enormously in their rate and pattern of cell turnover. At one 
extreme is nervous tissue, in which most of the nerve cells last a lifetime 
without replacement. At the other extreme is the intestinal epithelium, in 
which cells are replaced every three to six days. Between these extremes 
there is a spectrum of different rates and styles of cell turnover and tissue 
renewal. Bone (see Figure 20–8) has a turnover time of about ten years 
in humans, involving renewal of the matrix as well as of cells: old bone 
matrix is slowly eaten away by a set of cells called osteoclasts, akin to 
macrophages, while new matrix is deposited by another set of cells, oste-
oblasts, akin to fibroblasts. New red blood cells in humans are generated 
continually by blood-forming precursor cells in the bone marrow; they 
are  released  into  the  bloodstream,  where  they  recirculate  continually 
for about 120 days before being removed and destroyed in the liver and 
spleen. In the skin, the outer layers of the epidermis are continually flak-
ing off and being replaced from below, so that the epidermis is renewed 
with a turnover time of about two months. And so on. 

Our life depends on these renewal processes. A large dose of ionizing 
radiation blocks cell division and thus halts renewal: within a few days, 
the lining of the intestine, for example, becomes denuded of cells, leading 
to the devastating diarrhea and water loss characteristic of acute radia-
tion sickness.

Clearly,  there  have  to  be  elaborate  control  mechanisms  to  keep  cell 
production  and  cell  loss  in  balance  in  the  normal,  healthy  adult  body. 
Cancers  originate  through  violation  of  these  controls,  allowing  cells  in 
the self-renewing tissues to survive and proliferate to excess. To under-
stand cancer, therefore, it is important to understand the normal social 
controls on cell turnover that cancer perverts.

stem cells Generate a continuous supply of terminally 
differentiated cells
Most  of  the  specialized,  or  differentiated,  cells  that  need  continual 
replacement are themselves unable to divide. Red blood cells, the epider-
mal cells on the skin surface, and the absorptive and goblet cells of the 
gut epithelium are all examples of this type. Such cells are referred to as 
terminally differentiated: they lie at the dead end of their developmental 
pathway. 

The cells that replace the terminally differentiated cells that are lost are 
generated from a stock of proliferating precursor cells, which themselves 
usually derive from a much smaller number of self-renewing stem cells. 
Both stem cells and proliferating precursor cells are retained in the cor-
responding tissues along with the differentiated cells. Stem cells are not 
differentiated and can divide without limit (or at least for the lifetime of the 
animal). When a stem cell divides, though, each daughter has a choice: 
either it can remain a stem cell, or it can embark on a course leading to 
terminal  differentiation,  usually  via  a  series  of  precursor  cell  divisions 
(Figure 20–35). The job of the stem cells and precursor cells, therefore, 
is not to carry out the specialized function of the differentiated cells, but

Figure 20–35 when a stem cell divides, 
each daughter can either remain a stem 
cell or go on to become terminally 
differentiated. the terminally differentiated 
cells usually develop from precursor cells 
that divide a limited number of times before 
they terminally differentiate. Stem-cell 
divisions can also produce two stem cells or 
two precursor cells, as long as the pool of 
stem cells is maintained.

rather to produce cells that will. Stem cells are usually present in small 
numbers and often have a nondescript appearance, making them difficult 
to identify. Although stem cells and precursor cells are not differentiated, 
they  are  nonetheless  developmentally  restricted:  under  normal  condi-
tions, they stably express sets of transcription regulators that ensure that 
their differentiated progeny will be of the appropriate cell types. 

The pattern of cell replacement varies from one stem-cell-based tissue to 
another. In the lining of the small intestine, for example, the absorptive 
and secretory cells are arranged as a single-layered, simple epithelium 
covering the surfaces of the fingerlike villi that project into the gut lumen. 
This epithelium is continuous with the epithelium lining the crypts, which 
descend into the underlying connective tissue (Figure 20–36a). The stem 
cells  lie  near  the  bottom  of  the  crypts,  where  they  give  rise  mostly  to 
proliferating  precursor  cells,  which  move  upward  in  the  plane  of  the 
epithelial sheet. As they move upward, the precursor cells terminally dif-
ferentiate into absorptive or secretory cells, which are shed into the gut 
lumen and die when they reach the tips of the villi (Figure 20–36B). 

A contrasting example is the epidermis, a stratified epithelium. In the epi-
dermis,  proliferating  stem  cells  and  precursor  cells  are  confined  to  the 
basal layer, adhering to the basal lamina. The differentiating cells travel

a mixture of stem cells and dividing precursor cells that are produced from the stem cells. On emerging from the 
basal layer, the precursor cells stop dividing and move outward, differentiating as they go. eventually, the cells 
undergo a special form of cell death: the nucleus and other organelles disintegrate, and the cell shrinks to the form 
of a flattened scale, packed with keratin filaments. the scales are ultimately shed from the skin surface. (B) Light

of  the  cell  sheet;  terminally  differentiated  cells  and  their  corpses  are 
eventually shed from the skin surface (Figure 20–37). 

Often, a single type of stem cell gives rise to several types of differentiated 
progeny: the stem cells of the intestine, for example, produce absorptive 
cells, goblet cells, and several other secretory cell types. The process of 
blood-cell  formation,  or  hemopoiesis,  provides  an  extreme  example  of 
this phenomenon. All of the different cell types in the blood—both the red 
blood cells that carry oxygen and the many types of white blood cells that 
fight infection (Figure 20–38)—ultimately derive from a shared hemopoi-
etic stem cell found in the bone marrow (Figure 20–39). 

ECB4 e20.37/20.38

specific signals maintain stem-cell Populations
Every stem-cell system requires control mechanisms to ensure that new 
cells are generated in the appropriate places and in the right numbers. 
The  controls  depend  on  extracellular  signals  exchanged  between  the 
stem cells, their progeny, and other cell types in the area. These signals, 
and  the  intracellular  signaling  pathways  they  activate,  fall  into  a  sur-
prisingly small number of families, corresponding to half-a-dozen basic 
signaling mechanisms, some of which are discussed in Chapter 16. These 
few mechanisms are used again and again—in different combinations, 
evoking different responses in different contexts, in both the embryo and 
the adult. 

Almost all these signaling mechanisms contribute to the task of main-
taining  the  complex  organization  of  a  stem-cell  system  such  as  that 
of  the  intestine.  Thus,  a  class  of  signal  molecules  known  as  the  Wnt 
proteins serves to promote the proliferation of the stem cells and pre-
cursor  cells  at  the  base  of  each  intestinal  crypt  (Figure  20–40).  Cells 
in the crypt produce, in addition, other signals that act at longer range 
to prevent activation of the Wnt pathway outside the crypts. They also 
exchange yet other signals to control their diversification, so that some 
differentiate into secretory cells while others become absorptive cells.

cells lining the gut are renewed

Disorders of these signaling mechanisms disrupt the structure of the gut

stem cells can Be used to repair lost or damaged 
tissues
Because stem cells can proliferate indefinitely and produce progeny that 
differentiate,  they  provide  for  both  continual  renewal  of  normal  tissue 
and repair of tissue lost through injury. For example, by transfusing a few 
hemopoietic stem cells into a mouse whose own blood stem cells have 
been destroyed by irradiation, it is possible to fully repopulate the ani-
mal with new blood cells and ultimately rescue it from death by anemia, 
infection, or both. A similar approach is used in the treatment of human 
leukemia with irradiation (or cytotoxic drugs) followed by bone marrow 
transplantation.

Although stem cells taken directly from adult tissues such as bone mar-
row have already proven their clinical value, another type of stem cell, 
first  identified  through  experiments  in  mice,  may  have  even  greater

Figure 20–40 the wnt signaling pathway helps to control the 
production of differentiated cells from stem cells in the intestinal 
crypt. Wnt signaling maintains proliferation in the crypt. the Wnt 
proteins are secreted by cells in and around the crypt base, especially 
the paneth cells—a subclass of terminally differentiated secretory cells 
that are generated from the gut stem cells, but that move down to the 
crypt bottom instead of up to the tip of the villus. paneth cells have a 
dual function: they secrete antimicrobial peptides to keep infection at 
bay, and at the same time they provide the signals to sustain the stem-
cell population from which they themselves derive.

potential—both  for  treating  and  understanding  human  disease.  It  is 
possible,  through  cell  culture,  to  derive  from  early  mouse  embryos  an 
extraordinary  class  of  stem  cells  called  embryonic  stem  cells,  or  ES 
cells. Under appropriate conditions, these cells can be kept proliferating 
indefinitely in culture and yet retain unrestricted developmental potential 
and are thus said to be pluripotent: if the cells from the culture dish are 
put back into an early embryo, they can give rise to all the tissues and cell 
types in the body, including germ cells. Their descendants in the embryo 
are  able  to  integrate  perfectly  into  whatever  site  they  come  to  occupy, 
adopting the character and behavior that normal cells would show at that 
site. These cells can also be induced to differentiate in culture into a large 
variety of cell types (Figure 20–41).

Cells with properties similar to those of mouse ES cells can now be derived 
from early human embryos, creating a potentially inexhaustible supply of 
cells that might be used for the replacement or repair of mature human 
tissues that are damaged. For example, experiments in mice suggest that 
it should be possible to use ES cells to replace the skeletal muscle fibers 
that degenerate in victims of muscular dystrophy, the nerve cells that die 
in patients with Parkinson’s disease, the insulin-secreting cells that are 
destroyed in type 1 diabetics, and the cardiac muscle cells that die during 
a heart attack. Perhaps one day it might even become possible to grow 
entire organs from ES cells by a recapitulation of embryonic development 
(Figure 20–42). 

There are, however, many hurdles to be cleared before such dreams can 
become  reality.  One  major  problem  concerns  immune  rejection:  if  the 
transplanted cells are genetically different from the cells of the patient 
into whom they are grafted, they are likely to be rejected and destroyed 
by the immune system. Beyond the practical scientific difficulties, there 
have been ethical concerns about the use of human embryos and the pur-
poses to which human ES cells might be put. One anxiety, for example, 
has centered on the possibility of using ES cells for human “cloning.” But 
what exactly does this mean?

culture. If they are put back into an embryo, 
they will integrate perfectly and differentiate 
to suit whatever environment they are 
placed in. alternatively, these cells can be 
induced to differentiate into specific cell 
types in culture when provided with the 
appropriate extracellular signal molecules 
(movie 20.6). (Based on data from e. Fuchs

therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning are very 
different enterprises
The term “cloning” has been used in confusing ways as a shorthand term 
for several quite distinct types of procedure, particularly in public debates 
about the ethics of stem-cell research. It is important to understand the 
distinctions. 

ECB4 n20.100/20.43

As biologists define the term, a clone is simply a set of cells or individuals 
that are essentially genetically identical, by virtue of their descent from 
a single ancestor cell. The simplest type of cloning is the cloning of cells 
in a culture dish. For instance, one can take a single epidermal stem cell 
from the skin and let it proliferate in culture to obtain a large clone of 
genetically  identical  epidermal  cells.  Such  cells  could  be  used  to  help 
reconstruct the skin of a badly burned patient. This kind of cloning is no 
more than an extension by artificial means of the processes of cell prolif-
eration and differentiation that occur in a normal human body.

The cloning of entire multicellular animals, called reproductive cloning, 
is a very different enterprise, involving a far more radical departure from 
the ordinary course of nature. As we discuss in Chapter 19, each individ-
ual animal normally has both a mother and a father and is not genetically 
identical to either of them. In reproductive cloning, the need for two par-
ents and sexual union is bypassed. For mammals, this difficult feat has 
been achieved in mice and sheep and a variety of other domestic animals 
by a technique called nuclear transplantation. The procedure begins with 
an unfertilized egg cell. The nucleus of this haploid gamete is sucked out 
or destroyed, and in its place a nucleus from a regular diploid cell is intro-
duced. The diploid donor cell can, for example, be taken from a tissue of 
an adult individual. The hybrid cell, consisting of a diploid donor nucleus 
in a host egg cytoplasm, is allowed to develop for a few days in culture. 
In a small proportion of cases, this cell will give rise to an early embryo 
(a blastocyst) containing about 200 cells, which is then transferred into 
the uterus of a foster mother (Figure 20–43). If the experimenter is lucky, 
development continues as it would in a normal embryo, eventually giving 
rise to a whole new animal. An individual produced in this way, should 
be genetically identical to the adult individual who donated the diploid 
cell (except for the small amount of genetic information in mitochondria, 
which are inherited with the egg cytoplasm).

A  different  procedure,  called  therapeutic  cloning,  uses  the  technique 
of  nuclear  transplantation  to  produce  cultured  ES  cells,  rather  than  a 
cloned animal (see Figure 20–43). This approach is an elaborate method 
for generating personalized ES cells, with the aim of generating various 
cell types that can be used for tissue repair or to study disease mecha-
nisms. Because the cells obtained are genetically almost identical to the 
original donor cell, they can be grafted back into the adult from whom 
the donor nucleus was taken, thereby minimizing immunological rejec-
tion. Nuclear transplantation, however, is technically very difficult, and it 
has only recently been possible to use it to produce personalized human 
ES cells. Moreover, the procedure requires a supply of human egg cells, 
which raises ethical issues. Indeed, nuclear transplantation into human 
egg cells is outlawed in some countries.

ECB4 20.42/20.44

induced Pluripotent stem cells Provide a convenient 
source of Human es-like cells
The problems associated with making personalized ES cells by nuclear 
transplantation  can  now  be  bypassed  by  an  alternative  approach,  in 
which cells are taken from an adult tissue, grown in culture, and repro-
grammed into an ES-like state by artificially driving the expression of a 
set of three transcription regulators called Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4. This 
treatment is sufficient to convert fibroblasts into cells with practically all 
the properties of ES cells, including the ability to proliferate indefinitely 
and differentiate in diverse ways and to contribute to any tissue (Figure 
20–44).  These  ES-like  cells  are  called  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells 
(iPS cells). The conversion rate is low, however—only a tiny proportion 
of the fibroblasts make the switch—and there are serious worries about 
the  safety  of  implanting  into  humans  derivatives  of  cells  with  such  an 
abnormal developmental history. Much work remains to be done to allow 
this approach to be used to treat human diseases.

Figure 20–43 nuclear transplantation 
can be used for “cloning” in two 
quite different senses of the word. 
In reproductive cloning, a whole new 
multicellular individual is generated; in 
therapeutic cloning, only cells (personalized 
eS cells) are produced. Both procedures 
begin with nuclear transplantation, in 
which a nucleus taken from an adult cell 
is transferred into the cytoplasm of an 
enucleated egg cell, so as to create a cell 
that has an embryonic character but carries 
the genes of the adult cell.

Figure 20–44 Induced pluripotent stem 
cells (ipS cells) can be generated by 
transformation of cultured cells isolated 
from adult tissues. In the example shown, 
genes that encode several transcription 
regulators normally expressed in eS cells 
are introduced into cultured fibroblasts 
using genetically manipulated viruses as 
vectors. after a few weeks in culture, a 
small proportion of the fibroblasts have 
transformed into cells that look and behave 
like eS cells and have the same ability as 
eS cells to differentiate into any of the cell 
types in the body. 

712 

Chapter 20     cell communities: tissues, Stem cells, and cancer

Meanwhile, however, human ES cells and especially human iPS cells are 
proving to be valuable in other ways. They can be used to generate large, 
homogeneous populations of differentiated human cells of a specific type 
in culture; these can be used to test for potential toxic or beneficial effects 
of candidate drugs on specific human cell types. Moreover, it is possible 
to create iPS cells containing the genomes of patients who suffer from 
a  genetic  disease,  and  to  use  these  patient-specific  stem  cells  to  study 
the disease mechanism and to search for drugs that might be useful in 
the treatment of that disease. An example is Timothy syndrome, a rare 
genetic  disease  caused  by  mutations  in  a  gene  that  encodes  a  specific 
type of Ca2+ channel. The defective channel fails to close properly after 
opening, leading to abnormalities in heart rhythm and, in some individu-
als, to autism. The iPS cells produced from such individuals have been 
coaxed  to  differentiate  in  culture  into  neurons  and  heart  muscle  cells, 
which  are  now  being  used  to  study  the  physiological  consequences  of 
the Ca2+ channel abnormality and to hunt for drugs that can correct the 
defects.

In  addition,  experiments  on  the  pluripotent  stem  cells  themselves  are 
providing insights into some of the many unsolved mysteries of develop-
mental and stem-cell biology, including the mechanisms that make the 
specialized characters of most cells in adult tissues so remarkably stable 
under normal circumstances.

cancer
Humans pay a price for having tissues that can renew and repair them-
selves. The delicately adjusted mechanisms that control these processes 
can  go  wrong,  leading  to  catastrophic  disruption  of  tissue  structure. 
Foremost among the diseases of tissue renewal is cancer, which stands 
alongside  infectious  illness,  malnutrition,  war,  and  heart  disease  as 
a  major  cause  of  death  in  human  populations.  In  Europe  and  North 
America, for example, one in five of us will die of cancer. 

Cancer arises from violations of the basic rules of social cell behavior. To 
make sense of the origins and progression of the disease, and to devise 
treatments, we have to draw upon almost every part of our knowledge 
of how cells work and interact in tissues. Conversely, much of what we 
know about cell and tissue biology has been discovered as a by-product 
of  cancer  research.  In  this  section,  we  examine  the  causes  and  mech-
anisms  of  cancer,  the  types  of  cell  misbehavior  that  contribute  to  its 
progress, and the ways in which we hope to use our understanding to 
defeat these misbehaving cells and, hence, the disease. Although there 
are many types of cancer, each with distinct properties, we will refer to 
them  collectively  by  the  umbrella  term  “cancer,”  as  they  are  united  by 
certain common principles.

cancer cells Proliferate, invade, and metastasize
As tissues grow and renew themselves, each individual cell must adjust 
its behavior according to the needs of the organism as a whole. The cell 
must  divide  only  when  new  cells  of  that  type  are  needed,  and  refrain 
from dividing when they are not; it must live as long as it is needed, and 
kill itself when it is not; it must maintain its specialized character; and it 
must occupy its proper place and not stray into inappropriate territories.

In a large organism, no significant harm is done if an occasional single 
cell misbehaves. But a potentially devastating breakdown of order occurs 
when a single cell suffers a genetic alteration that allows it to survive and 
divide when it should not, producing daughter cells that behave in the 
same  antisocial  way.  Such  a  relentlessly  expanding  clone  of  abnormal

basal lamina, migrate through connective 
tissue, and get into either blood or

from the bloodstream or lymph and settle, 
survive, and proliferate in a new location.

cells can disrupt the organization of the tissue, and eventually that of the 
body as a whole. It is this catastrophe that happens in cancer.

ECB4 e20.44/20.46

Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties: they and their prog-
eny (1) proliferate in defiance of the normal constraints and (2) invade 
and colonize territories normally reserved for other cells (Movie  20.7). 
It is the combination of these socially deviant features that creates the 
lethal danger. Cells that have the first property but not the second prolif-
erate excessively but remain clustered together in a single mass, forming 
a tumor. But the tumor in this case is said to be benign, and it can usu-
ally be removed cleanly and completely by surgery. A tumor is cancerous 
only  if  its  cells  have  the  ability  to  invade  surrounding  tissue,  in  which 
case the tumor is said to be malignant. Malignant tumor cells with this 
invasive property often break loose from the primary tumor and enter the 
bloodstream or lymphatic vessels, where they form secondary tumors, or 
metastases, at other sites in the body (Figure 20–45). The more widely 
the cancer spreads, the harder it is to eradicate.

epidemiological studies identify Preventable causes of 
cancer
Prevention is always better than cure, but to prevent cancer we need to 
know what causes it. Do factors in our environment or features of our 
way of life trigger the disease and help it to progress? If so, what are they? 
Answers to these questions come mainly from epidemiology—the statisti-
cal analysis of human populations, looking for factors that correlate with 
disease incidence. This approach has provided strong evidence that the 
environment plays an important part in the causation of most cases of 
cancer. The types of cancers that are common, for example, vary from 
country to country, and studies of migrants show that it is usually where 
people live, rather than where they were born, that governs their cancer 
risk.

Chapter 20     cell communities: tissues, Stem cells, and cancer

Although  it  is  still  hard  to  discover  which  specific  factors  in  the  envi-
ronment  or  lifestyle  are  significant,  and  many  remain  unknown,  some 
have been precisely identified. For example, it was noted long ago that 
cervical  cancer,  which  arises  in  the  epithelium  lining  the  cervix  (neck) 
of  the  uterus,  was  much  more  common  in  women  who  were  sexually 
experienced than in those who were not, suggesting a cause related to 
sexual activity. We now know, through modern epidemiological studies, 
that  most  cases  of  cervical  cancer  depend  on  infection  of  the  cervical 
epithelium with certain subtypes of a common virus, called human papil-
lomavirus. This virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse and can 
sometimes, if one is unlucky, provoke uncontrolled proliferation of the 
infected  cells.  Knowing  this,  we  can  attempt  to  prevent  the  cancer  by 
preventing the infection—for example, by vaccination against papilloma- 
virus. Such a vaccine is now available, conferring a high level of protec-
tion if given to young people before they become sexually active.

In the great majority of human cancers, however, viruses do not appear 
to play a part: as we will see, cancer is not an infectious disease. But epi-
demiology reveals that other factors increase the risk of cancer. Obesity 
is  one  such  factor.  Smoking  tobacco  is  another:  tobacco  smoke  is  not 
only responsible for almost all cases of lung cancer, but it also raises the 
incidence of several other cancers, such as those of the bladder. By stop-
ping the use of tobacco, we could prevent about 30% of all cancer deaths. 
No  other  single  policy  or  treatment  is  known  that  would  have  such  a 
dramatic impact on the cancer death rate. 

As we will explain, although environmental factors affect the incidence of 
cancer and are critical for some forms of the disease, it would be wrong 
to conclude that they are the only cause of cancers. No matter how hard 
we try to prevent cancer by healthy living, we will never be able to eradi-
cate this disease. To devise effective treatments, we need to derive a deep 
understanding  of  the  biology  of  cancer  cells  and  the  mechanisms  that 
underlie the growth and spread of tumors.

cancers develop by an accumulation of mutations
Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease: it arises as a consequence of 
pathological changes in the information carried by DNA. It differs from 
other genetic diseases in that the mutations underlying cancer are mainly 
somatic  mutations—those  that  occur  in  individual  somatic  cells  of  the 
body—as opposed to germ-line mutations, which are handed down via 
the germ cells from which the entire multicellular organism develops. 

Most  of  the  identified  agents  known  to  contribute  to  the  causation  of 
cancer,  including  ionizing  radiation  and  most  chemical  carcinogens, 
are mutagens: they cause changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. 
But even in an environment that is free of tobacco smoke, radioactivity, 
and all the other external mutagens that worry us, mutations will occur 
spontaneously as a result of fundamental limitations on the accuracy of 
DNA replication and DNA repair (discussed in Chapter 6). In fact, envi-
ronmental carcinogens other than tobacco smoke probably account for 
only a small fraction of the mutations responsible for cancer, and elimi-
nation of all these external risk factors would still leave us prone to the 
disease. 

Although DNA is replicated and repaired with great accuracy, an average 
of one mistake slips by for every 109 or 1010 nucleotides copied, as we 
discuss in Chapter 6. This means that spontaneous mutations occur at an 
estimated rate of about 10–6 or 10–7 mutations per gene per cell division, 
even without encouragement by external mutagens. About 1016 cell divi-
sions take place in a human body in the course of an average lifetime; 
thus,  every  single  gene  is  likely  to  have  acquired  a  mutation  on  more 

than 109 separate occasions in any individual. From this point of view, 
the problem of cancer seems to be not why it occurs, but why it occurs 
so infrequently. 

The  explanation  is  that  it  takes  more  than  a  single  mutation  to  turn  a 
normal  cell  into  a  cancer  cell.  Precisely  how  many  are  required  is  still 
a matter of debate, but for most full blown cancers it could be at least 
10—and, as we will see, they have to affect the right type of gene. These 
mutations do not all occur at once, but sequentially, usually over a period 
of many years. 

Cancer,  therefore,  is  most  often  a  disease  of  old  age,  because  it  takes 
a long time for an individual clone of cells—those derived from a com-
mon  founder—to  accumulate  a  large  number  of  mutations  (see  Figure 
6–32).  In  fact,  most  human  cancer  cells  not  only  contain  many  muta-
tions,  but  they  are  also  genetically  unstable.  This  genetic  instability 
results  from  mutations  that  interfere  with  the  accurate  replication  and 
maintenance of the genome and thereby increase the mutation rate itself. 
Sometimes, the increased mutation rate may result from a defect in one 
of the many proteins needed to repair damaged DNA or to correct errors 
in DNA replication. Sometimes, there may be a defect in the cell-cycle 
checkpoint mechanisms that normally prevent a cell with damaged DNA 
from attempting to divide before it has completed the repair (discussed in 
Chapter 18). Sometimes, there may be a fault in the machinery of mitosis, 
which can lead to chromosomal damage, loss, or gain. These potential 
sources of genetic instability are summarized in table 20–1. 

Genetic instability can generate extra chromosomes, as well as chromo-
some breaks and rearrangements—gross abnormalities that can be seen 
in a karyotype (Figure 20–46). It can also help drive the evolution of can-
cer, as we now discuss.

cancer cells evolve, Giving them an increasingly 
competitive advantage
The mutations that lead to cancer do not cripple the mutant cells. On the 
contrary, they give these cells a competitive advantage over their neigh-
bors. It is this advantage enjoyed by the mutant cells that leads to disaster 
for  the  organism  as  a  whole.  As  an  initial  population  of  mutant  cells 
grows, it slowly evolves: new chance mutations occur, some of which are 
favored by natural selection because they enhance cell proliferation and

karyotype also contains 48 chromosomes, 
instead of the normal 46. Such abnormalities 
in chromosome number can further cause 
chromosome-segregation errors when the 
cell divides, so that the degree of genetic 
disruption goes from bad to worse (see

Figure 20–47 tumors evolve by repeated 
rounds of mutation, proliferation, and 
natural selection. the final outcome is a 
fully malignant tumor. at each step, a single 
cell undergoes a mutation that enhances 
its ability to proliferate, or survive, or both, 
so that its progeny become a dominant 
clone in the tumor. proliferation of this clone 
then hastens occurrence of the next step of 
tumor progression by increasing the size of 
the cell population at risk of undergoing an 
additional mutation. Some cancers contain 
multiple malignant clones, each with its 
own collection of mutations, in addition to 
a common set of mutations that reflect the 
tumor’s origin from a founding mutant cell 
(not shown).

cell survival. This process of random mutation followed by selection cul-
minates in the genesis of cancer cells that run riot within the population 
of cells that form the body, upsetting its regular structure (Figure 20–47). 

Non-mutagenic  environmental  or  lifestyle  factors  such  as  obesity  may 
favor the development of cancer by altering the selection pressures that 
operate in tissues. A glut of circulating nutrients, or abnormal increases 
in hormones, mitogens, or growth factors, for example, may help cells 
with dangerous mutations survive, grow, and proliferate. Eventually, cells 
emerge that have all the abnormalities required for full-blown cancer. 

To be successful, a cancer cell must acquire a whole range of abnormal 
properties—a collection of subversive behaviors. A proliferating precur-
sor  cell  in  the  epithelial  lining  of  the  gut,  for  example,  must  undergo 
changes that permit it to carry on dividing when it would normally stop 
(see Figure 20–36). That cell and its progeny must also be able to avoid 
cell  death,  displace  their  normal  neighbors,  and  attract  a  blood  supply 
to nourish continued tumor growth. For the tumor cells to then become 
invasive, they must be able to detach from the epithelial sheet and digest 
their way through the basal lamina into the underlying connective tissue. 
To spread to other organs and form metastases, they must be able to get 
in, and then out, of blood or lymph vessels and settle, survive, and prolif-
erate in new sites (see Figure 20–45).

require  different  combinations  of  properties. 
Different  cancers 
Nevertheless, we can draw up a general list of characteristics that distin-
guish cancer cells from normal cells.

1.  Cancer  cells  have  a  reduced  dependence  on  signals  from  other 
cells for their survival, growth, and division. Often, this is because 
they contain mutations in components of the cell signaling path-
ways that normally respond to such stimuli. An activating mutation 
in  a  Ras  gene  (discussed  in  Chapter  16),  for  example,  can  cause 
an intracellular signal for proliferation even in the absence of the 
extracellular  cue  that  would  normally  be  needed  to  turn  Ras  on, 
like a faulty doorbell that rings even when nobody is pressing the 
button.

2.  Cancer cells can survive levels of stress and internal derangement 
that  would  cause  normal  cells  to  kill  themselves  by  apoptosis. 
This  avoidance  of  cell  suicide  is  often  the  result  of  mutations  in 
genes that regulate the intracellular death program responsible for 
apoptosis (discussed in Chapter 18). For example, about 50% of all 
human cancers have an inactivating mutation in the p53 gene. The 
p53 protein normally acts as part of a DNA damage response that 
causes cells with DNA damage to either cease dividing (see Figure 
18–15) or die by apoptosis. Chromosome breakage, for example, 
if not repaired, will generally cause a cell to commit suicide; but 
if the cell is defective in p53, it may survive and divide, creating 
highly abnormal daughter cells that have the potential for further 
mischief.

3.  Unlike most normal human cells, cancer cells can often proliferate 
indefinitely.  Most  normal  human  somatic  cells  will  only  divide  a 
limited number of times in culture, after which they permanently 
stop;  this  is  at  least  partly  because  they  have  lost  the  ability  to 
produce  the  enzyme  telomerase,  so  the  telomeres  at  the  ends  of 
their  chromosomes  become  progressively  shorter  with  each  cell 
division (see page 210). Cancer cells typically break through this 
proliferation barrier by reactivating production of telomerase, ena-
bling them to maintain telomere length indefinitely.

4.  Most cancer cells are genetically unstable, with a greatly increased 

mutation rate and an abnormal number of chromosomes.

5.  Cancer cells are abnormally invasive, at least partly because they 
often lack certain cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, that 
help hold normal cells in their proper place.

6.  Cancer cells have an abnormal metabolism that makes them avid 
for nutrients, which they use to fuel their biosynthesis and growth, 
rather than for energy generation by oxidative phosphorylation.

7.  Cancer  cells  can  survive  and  proliferate  in  abnormal  locations, 
whereas most normal cells die when misplaced. This colonization 
of unfamiliar territory may result from the ability of cancer cells to 
produce  their  own  extracellular  survival  signals  and  to  suppress 
their apoptosis program (as described in #2, above).  

To understand the molecular biology of cancer, we have to identify the 
mutations responsible for these abnormal properties.

two main classes of Genes are critical for cancer: 
oncogenes and tumor suppressor Genes
Investigators have made use of a variety of approaches to track down the 
genes and mutations that are critical for cancer—from studying viruses 
that cause cancer in chickens to following families in which a particular 
cancer occurs unusually often. Though many of the most important of 
these genes have been identified, the hunt for others continues. 

For many cancer-critical genes, the dangerous mutations are ones that 
render the encoded protein hyperactive. These gain-of-function mutations 
have a dominant effect: only one gene copy needs to be mutated to cause 
trouble. The resulting mutant gene is called an oncogene, and the cor-
responding normal form of the gene is called a proto-oncogene (Figure 
20–48a). Figure 20–49 shows a variety of ways in which a proto-onco-
gene can be converted into its corresponding oncogene.

For other genes, the danger lies in mutations that destroy their activity. 
These loss-of-function mutations are generally recessive: both copies of 
the gene must be lost or inactivated before an effect is seen; the normal

for cancer are classified as proto-
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, 
according to whether the dangerous 
mutations are dominant or recessive. 
(a) Oncogenes act in a dominant manner: 
a gain-of-function mutation in a single 
copy of the proto-oncogene can drive a 
cell toward cancer. (B) Loss-of-function 
mutations in tumor suppressor genes 
generally act in a recessive manner: the 
function of both copies of the gene 
must be lost to drive a cell toward 
cancer. In this diagram, normal genes 
are represented by light blue squares, 
activating mutations by red rays, and 
inactivating mutations by hollow red 
rectangles.

Figure 20–49 Several kinds of genetic change can convert a proto-oncogene into an oncogene. In each case, 
the change leads to an increase in the gene’s function—that is, it is a gain-of-function mutation.

gene is called a tumor suppressor gene (Figure 20–48B). In addition to 
such  genetic  alterations,  tumor  suppressor  genes  can  also  be  silenced 
by  epigenetic  changes,  which  alter  gene  expression  without  changing 
the gene’s nucleotide sequence (as discussed in Chapter 8). Epigenetic 
changes  are  thought  to  silence  some  tumor  suppressor  genes  in  most 
human cancers. Figure 20–50 highlights a few of the ways in which the 
activity of a tumor suppressor gene can be lost.

The  variety  of  proto-oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor  genes  code  for 
proteins of many different types, corresponding to the many kinds of mis-
behavior that cancer cells display. Some of these proteins are involved in 
signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, cell growth, or cell divi-
sion. Others take part in DNA repair, mediate the DNA damage response, 
modify chromatin, or help regulate the cell cycle or apoptosis. Still others 
(such as cadherins) are involved in cell adhesion or other properties criti-
cal for metastasis, or have roles that we do not yet properly understand.

cancer-causing mutations cluster in a Few Fundamental 
Pathways
From the point of view of a cancer cell, oncogenes and tumor suppres-
sor genes—and the mutations that affect them—are flip sides of the same 
coin.  Activation  of  an  oncogene  and  inactivation  of  a  tumor  suppres-
sor gene can both promote the development of cancer. And both types 
of mutations are called into play in most cancers. In classifying cancer-
critical  genes,  it  seems  that  the  type  of  mutation—gain-of-function  or 
loss-of-function—matters less than the pathway in which it acts. 

Rapid,  low-cost  DNA  sequencing  is  now  providing  an  unprecedented 
amount of information about the mutations that drive a variety of can-
cers. We can now compare the complete genome sequences of the cancer 
cells from a patient’s tumor to the genome sequence of the noncancer-
ous cells in the same individual—or of cancer cells that have spread to 
another location in the body. By putting together such data from many 
different patients, we can begin to draw up exhaustive lists of the genes 
that are critical for specific classes of cancer; and by analysis of data from 
a single patient, we can deduce the “family tree” of his or her cancer cells, 
showing how the progeny of the original founder cell have evolved and 
diversified as they multiplied and metastasized to different sites.

One remarkable finding has been that many of the genes mutated in indi-
vidual tumors fall into a small number of key regulatory pathways: those 
that  govern  the  initiation  of  cell  proliferation,  control  cell  growth,  and 
regulate the cell’s response to DNA damage and stress. For example, in 
almost  every  case  of  glioblastoma—the  most  common  type  of  human 
brain  tumor—mutations  disrupt  all  three  of  these  fundamental  path-
ways, and the same pathways are subverted, in one way or another, in 
almost  all  human  cancers  (Figure  20–51).  In  any  given  patient,  only  a 
single  gene  tends  to  be  mutated  in  each  pathway,  but  not  always  the 
same gene: it is the under- or overactivity of the pathway that matters for 
cancer development, not the way in which this malfunction is achieved. 
Because the same three fundamental control systems are subverted in so 
wide a variety of cancers, it seems that their misregulation must be key 
to most cancers’ success.

colorectal cancer illustrates How loss of a tumor 
suppressor Gene can lead to cancer
Colorectal  cancer  provides  one  well-studied  example  of  how  a  tumor 
suppressor  can  be  identified  and  its  role  in  tumor  growth  determined. 
Colorectal  cancer  arises  from  the  epithelium  lining  the  colon  and  rec-
tum; most cases are seen in old people and do not have any discernible 
hereditary cause. A small proportion of cases, however, occur in families 
that are exceptionally prone to the disease and show an unusually early 
onset. In one set of such “predisposed” families, the affected individuals 
develop colorectal cancer in early adult life, and the onset of their disease 
is foreshadowed by the development of hundreds or thousands of little 
tumors, called polyps, in the epithelial lining of the colon and rectum. 

By studying these families, investigators traced the development of the 
polyps  to  a  deletion  or  inactivation  of  a  tumor  suppressor  gene  called 
APC—for Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. (Note that the protein encoded by 
this gene is different from the anaphase-promoting complex, also abbre-
viated  APC,  discussed  in  Chapter  18.)  Affected  individuals  inherit  one 
mutant  copy  of  the  gene  and  one  normal  copy.  Although  one  normal 
gene copy is enough for normal cell behavior, all the cells of these indi-
viduals are only one mutational step away from total loss of the gene’s 
function (as compared to two steps away for a person who inherits two 

720 

Chapter 20     cell communities: tissues, Stem cells, and cancer

normal copies of the gene). The individual tumors arise from cells that 
have undergone a somatic mutation that inactivates the remaining good 
copy. Because the number of new mutations required is smaller, the dis-
ease strikes these individuals at an earlier age. 

But  what  about  the  great  majority  of  colorectal  cancer  patients,  who 
have inherited two good copies of APC and do not have the hereditary 
condition or any significant family history of cancer? When their tumors 
are analyzed, it turns out that in more than 60% of cases, although both 
copies of APC are present in the adjacent normal tissue, the tumor cells 
themselves have lost or inactivated both copies of this gene, presumably 
through two independent somatic mutations. 

All these findings clearly identify APC as a tumor suppressor gene and, 
knowing its sequence and mutant phenotype, one can begin to decipher 
how  its  loss  helps  to  initiate  the  development  of  cancer.  As  explained 
in how we Know (pp. 722–723), the APC gene was found to encode an 
inhibitory protein that normally restricts the activation of the Wnt sign-
aling pathway, which is involved in stimulating cell proliferation in the 
crypts  of  the  gut  lining,  as  described  earlier  (see  Figure  20–40).  When 
APC is lost, the pathway is hyperactive and epithelial cells proliferate to 
excess, generating a polyp (Figure 20–52). Within this growing mass of 
tissue, further mutations occur, sometimes resulting in invasive cancer 
(Figure 20–53).

an understanding of cancer cell Biology opens the Way 
to new treatments
The better we understand the tricks that cancer cells use to survive, pro-
liferate, and spread, the better are our chances of finding ways to defeat 
them. The task is made more challenging because cancer cells are highly 
mutable and, like weeds or parasites, rapidly evolve resistance to treat-
ments  used  to  exterminate  them.  Moreover,  because  mutations  arise 
randomly, every case of cancer is likely to have its own unique combi-
nation of genes mutated. Even within an individual patient, tumor cells 
do  not  all  contain  the  same  genetic  lesions.  Thus,  no  single  treatment 
is  likely  to  work  in  every  patient,  or  even  for  every  cancer  cell  within 
the  same  patient.  And  the  fact  that  cancers  generally  are  not  detected 
until  the  primary  tumor  has  reached  a  diameter  of  1  cm  or  more—by 

Figure 20–52 Colorectal cancer often 
begins with loss of the tumor suppressor 
gene APC, leading to growth of a polyp. 
(a) thousands of small polyps, and a few 
much larger ones, are seen in the lining 
of the colon of a patient with an inherited 
APC mutation (whereas individuals without 
an APC mutation might have one or two 
polyps). through further mutations, some 
of these polyps will progress to become 
invasive cancers, unless the tissue is 
removed surgically. (B) cross section of one

Figure 20–53 a polyp in the epithelial lining of the colon or 
rectum, caused by loss of the APC gene, can progress to cancer by 
accumulation of further mutations. the diagram shows a sequence 
of mutations that might underlie a typical case of colorectal cancer. 
after the initial mutation, all subsequent mutations occur randomly 
in a single cell that had already acquired the previous mutations. a 
sequence of events such as that shown here would usually be spread 
over 10 to 20 years or more. though most colorectal cancers are 
thought to begin with loss of the APC tumor suppressor gene, the 
subsequent sequence of mutations is quite variable; indeed, many 
polyps never progress to cancer.

which  time  it  consists  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  cells  that  are  already 
genetically diverse and often have already begun to metastasize (Figure 
20–54)—makes treatment even harder still.

Yet,  in  spite  of  these  difficulties,  an  increasing  number  of  cancers  can 
be treated effectively. Surgery remains a highly effective tactic, and sur-
gical  techniques  are  continually  improving:  in  many  cases,  if  a  cancer 
has not spread far, it can often be cured by simply cutting it out. Where 
surgery fails, therapies based on the intrinsic peculiarities of cancer cells 
can be used. Lack of normal cell-cycle control mechanisms, for exam-
ple, may help make cancer cells particularly vulnerable to DNA damage: 
whereas  a  normal  cell  will  halt  its  proliferation  until  such  damage  is 
repaired, a cancer cell may charge ahead regardless, producing daughter 
cells that may die because they inherit too many unrepaired breakages 
in their chromosomes. Presumably for this reason, cancer cells can often 
be killed by doses of radiotherapy or DNA-damaging chemotherapy that 
leave normal cells relatively unharmed.

Surgery,  radiation,  and  chemotherapy  are  long-established  treatments, 
but many novel approaches are also being enthusiastically pursued. In 
some cases, as with loss of a normal response to DNA damage, the very 
feature that helps to make the cancer cell dangerous also makes it vulner-
able, enabling doctors to kill it with a properly targeted treatment. Some 
cancers of the breast and ovary, for example, owe their genetic instabil-
ity to the lack of a protein (Brca1 or Brca2) needed for accurate repair of 
double-strand breaks in DNA (discussed in Chapter 6); the cancer cells 
survive by relying on alternative types of DNA repair mechanisms. Drugs 
that inhibit one of these alternative DNA repair mechanisms kill the can-
cer cells by raising their genetic instability to such a level that the cells die 
from chromosome fragmentation when they attempt to divide. Normal 
cells, which have an intact double-strand break repair mechanism, are 
relatively unaffected, and the drugs seem to have few side effects.

Another set of strategies aims to use the immune system to kill the tumor 
cells,  taking  advantage  of  tumor-specific  cell-surface  molecules  to  tar-
get the attack. Antibodies that recognize these tumor molecules can be 
produced in vitro and injected into the patient to mark the tumor cells for 
destruction. Other antibodies, aimed at the immune cells, can promote 
the elimination of cancer cells by neutralizing the inhibitory cell-surface 
molecules that keep the immune system’s killer cells in check. The latter 
antibodies have been remarkably effective in clinical trials and, in princi-
ple, should be useful for treating a variety of different cancers.

In some cancers, it is becoming possible to target the products of specific 
oncogenes directly so as to block their action, causing the cancer cells 
to die. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the misbehavior of the can-
cer cells depends on a mutant intracellular signaling protein (a tyrosine 
kinase) that causes the cells to proliferate when they should not. A small 
drug molecule, called imatinib (trade name Gleevec), blocks the activity

MaKInG SenSe oF the GeneS that are CrItICal For CanCer

The search for genes that are critical for cancer some-
times  begins  with  a  family  that  shows  an  inherited 
predisposition  to  a  particular  form  of  the  disease. 
APC—a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently deleted 
or inactivated in colorectal cancer—was tracked down 
by searching for genetic defects in such families prone 
to the disease. But identifying the gene is only half the 
battle.  The  next  step  is  determining  what  the  normal 
gene does in a normal cell—and why alterations in the 
gene promote cancer.

Guilt by association
Determining  what  a  gene—or  its  encoded  product—
does inside a cell is not a simple task. Imagine isolating 
an  uncharacterized  protein  and  being  told  that  it  acts 
as  a  protein  kinase.  That  information  does  not  reveal 
how the protein functions in the context of a living cell. 
What proteins does the kinase phosphorylate? In which 
tissues is it active? What role does it have in the growth, 
development,  or  physiology  of  the  organism?  A  great 
deal of additional information is required to understand 
the biological context in which the kinase acts.

Most proteins do not function in isolation: they interact 
with other proteins in the cell. Thus one way to begin to 
decipher a protein’s biological role is to identify its bind-
ing partners. If an uncharacterized protein interacts with 
a protein whose role in the cell is understood, the func-
tion of the unknown protein is likely to be in some way 
related.  The  simplest  method  for  identifying  proteins 
that  bind  to  one  another  tightly  is  co-immunoprecipi-
tation  (see  Panel  4–3,  pp.  164–165).  In  this  technique, 
an antibody is used to capture and precipitate a specific 
target  protein  from  an  extract  prepared  by  breaking 
open cells; if this target protein is associated tightly with 
another  protein,  the  partner  protein  will  precipitate  as 
well. This is the approach that was taken to character-
ize the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene product, APC.

Two groups of researchers used antibodies against APC 
to isolate the protein from extracts prepared from cul-
tured human cells. The antibodies captured APC along 
with a second protein. When the researchers examined 
the amino acid sequence of this partner, they recognized 
the protein as β-catenin.
The discovery that APC interacts with β-catenin initially 
led  to  some  wrong  guesses  about  the  role  of  APC  in 
colorectal  cancer.  In  mammals,  β-catenin  was  known 
primarily  for  its  role  at  adherens  junctions,  where  it 
serves  as  a  linker  to  connect  membrane-spanning 
cadherin  proteins  to  the  intracellular  actin  cytoskel-
eton  (see,  for  example,  Figure  20–24).  Thus,  for  some 
time,  scientists  thought  that  APC  might  be  involved  in 
cell  adhesion.  But  within  a  few  years,  it  emerged  that 

β-catenin  also  has  another  completely  different  func-
tion. It is this unexpected function that turned out to be 
the one that is relevant for understanding APC’s role in 
cancer.

Wingless flies
Not  long  before  the  discovery  that  APC  binds  to 
β-catenin, developmental biologists working on the fruit 
fly Drosophila had noticed that the human β-catenin pro-
tein is very similar in amino acid sequence to a Drosophila 
protein called Armadillo. Armadillo was known to be a 
key protein in a signaling pathway that has an important 
role in normal development in flies. The pathway is acti-
vated by the Wnt family of extracellular signal proteins, 
the  founding  member  of  which  was  called  Wingless, 
after its mutant phenotype in flies. Wnt proteins bind to 
receptors on the surface of a cell, switching on an intra-
cellular  signaling  pathway  that  ultimately  leads  to  the 
activation  of  a  set  of  genes  that  influence  cell  growth, 
division,  and  differentiation.  Mutations  in  any  of  the 
proteins  in  this  pathway  lead  to  developmental  errors 
that  disrupt  the  basic  body  plan  of  the  fly.  The  least 
devastating  mutations  cause  flies  to  develop  without 
wings; most mutations, however, result in the death of 
the embryo. In either case, the damage is done through 
effects on gene expression. This strongly suggested that 
Armadillo, and hence its vertebrate homolog β-catenin, 
were  not  just  involved  in  cell  adhesion,  but  somehow 
mediated  the  control  of  gene  expression  through  the 
Wnt signaling pathway.

Although the Wnt pathway was discovered and studied 
intensively in fruit flies, it was later found to control many 
aspects  of  development  in  vertebrates,  including  mice 
and  humans.  Indeed,  some  of  the  proteins  in  the  Wnt 
pathway function almost interchangeably in Drosophila 
and vertebrates. The direct link between β-catenin and 
gene expression became clear from work in mammalian 
cells.  Just  as  APC  could  be  used  as  “bait”  to  catch  its 
partner β-catenin by immunoprecipitation, so β-catenin 
could  be  used  as  bait  to  catch  the  next  protein  in  the 
signaling  pathway.  This  was  found  to  be  a  transcrip-
tion regulator called LEF-1/TCF, or TCF for short. It too 
was found to have a Drosophila counterpart in the Wnt 
pathway, and a combination of Drosophila genetics and 
mammalian cell biology revealed how the gene control 
mechanism works. 

Wnt transmits its signal by promoting the accumulation 
of  “free”  β-catenin  (or,  in  flies,  Armadillo)—that  is,  of 
β-catenin that is not locked up in cell junctions. This free 
protein  migrates  from  the  cytoplasm  into  the  nucleus. 
There  it  binds  to  the  TCF  transcription  regulator,  cre-
ating  a  complex  that  activates  transcription  of  various

normally required for maintaining the pool of proliferat-
ing gut stem cells.

It turns out that APC regulates the activity of this path-
way by facilitating degradation of β-catenin and thereby 
preventing it from activating TCF in cells where no Wnt 
signal  has  been  received  (see  Figure  20–55A).  Loss  of 
APC  allows  the  concentration  of  β-catenin  to  rise,  so 
that  TCF  is  activated  and  Wnt-responsive  genes  are 
turned on even in the absence of a Wnt signal. But how 
does  this  promote  the  development  of  colorectal  can-
cer?  To  find  out,  researchers  turned  to  mice  that  lack 
TCF4, a member of the TCF gene family that is specifi-
cally expressed in the gut epithelial lining.

tales from the crypt
Although it may seem counterintuitive, one of the most 
direct ways of finding out what a gene normally does is 
to see what happens to the organism when that gene is 
missing. If one can pinpoint the processes that are dis-
rupted or compromised, one can begin to decipher the 
gene’s function.

With  this  in  mind,  researchers  generated  “knockout” 
mice in which the gene encoding TCF4 was disrupted. 
The  mutation  is  lethal:  mice  lacking  TCF4  die  shortly 
after  birth.  But  the  animals  showed  an  interesting 
abnormality  in  their  intestines.  The  intestinal  crypts, 
which contain the stem cells responsible for the renewal 
of  the  gut  lining  (see  Figure  20–36),  completely  failed 
to  develop.  The  researchers  concluded  that  TCF4  is  

When APC is missing, we see the other side of the coin: 
without  APC  to  promote  its  degradation,  β-catenin 
accumulates in excessive quantities, binds to the TCF4 
transcription  regulator,  and  thereby  overactivates  the 
TCF4-responsive  genes.  This  drives  the  formation  of 
polyps  by  promoting  the  inappropriate  proliferation  of 
gut  stem  cells.  Differentiated  progeny  cells  continue 
to  be  produced  and  discarded  into  the  gut  lumen,  but 
the crypt cell population grows too fast for this disposal 
mechanism  to  keep  pace.  The  result  is  crypt  enlarge-
ment and a steady increase in the number of crypts. The 
growing mass of tissue bulges out into the gut lumen as 
a polyp (see Figure 20–52 and Movie 20.8). A number of 
additional  mutations  are  needed,  however,  to  convert 
this primary tumor into an invasive cancer.

More  than  60%  of  human  colorectal  tumors  harbor 
mutations  in  the  APC  gene.  Interestingly,  among  the 
minority  class  of  tumors  that  retain  functional  APC, 
about a quarter have activating mutations in β-catenin 
instead.  These  mutations  tend  to  make  the  β-catenin 
protein more resistant to degradation and thus produce 
the  same  effect  as  loss  of  APC.  In  fact,  mutations  that 
enhance the activity of β-catenin have been found in a 
wide variety of other tumor types, including melanomas, 
stomach cancers, and liver cancers. Thus, the genes that 
encode proteins that act in the Wnt signaling pathway 
provide multiple targets for mutations that can spur the 
development of cancer.

Figure 20–55 the apC protein keeps

when the cell is not exposed to wnt 
protein. It does this by promoting 
degradation of the signaling molecule 
β-catenin. In the presence of Wnt, or in 
the absence of active apc, free β-catenin 
becomes plentiful and combines with 
the transcription regulator tcF to drive 
transcription of Wnt-responsive genes and, 
ultimately, the proliferation of stem cells 
in the intestinal crypt (see Figure 20–40). 
In the colon, mutations that inactivate 
apc initiate tumors by causing excessive 
activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.

a dramatic success: in many patients, the abnormal proliferation and sur-
vival of the leukemic cells are strongly inhibited, providing many years 
of symptom-free survival. The same drug is also effective in some other 
cancers that depend on similar oncogenes.

With  these  examples  before  us,  we  can  hope  that  our  modern  under-
standing of the molecular biology of cancer will soon allow us to devise 
effective rational treatments for even more forms of cancer. At the same 
time, cancer research has taught us many important lessons about basic 
cell biology. The applications of that knowledge go far beyond the treat-
ment  of  cancer,  giving  us  insight  into  the  way  the  whole  living  world 
works.

Questions

Question 20–9
Which of the following statements are correct? explain your 
answers.
a. Gap junctions connect the cytoskeleton of one cell to 
that of a neighboring cell or to the extracellular matrix.
B. a wilted plant leaf can be likened to a deflated bicycle 
tire.
c. Because of their rigid structure, proteoglycans can 
withstand a large amount of compressive force.
d. the basal lamina is a specialized layer of extracellular 
matrix to which sheets of epithelial cells are attached.
e. skin cells are continually shed and are renewed every few 
weeks; for a permanent tattoo, it is therefore necessary to 
deposit pigment below the epidermis. 
F. although stem cells are not differentiated, they are 
specialized and therefore give rise only to specific cell types.

Question 20–10
Which of the following substances would you expect to 
spread from one cell to the next through (a) gap junctions 
and (b) plasmodesmata: glutamic acid, mrna, cyclic amP, 
ca2+, G proteins, and plasma membrane phospholipids? 

Question 20–11
discuss the following statement: “if plant cells contained 
intermediate filaments to provide the cells with tensile 
strength, their cell walls would be dispensable.”

Question 20–12
through the exchange of small metabolites and ions, gap 
junctions provide metabolic and electrical coupling between 
cells. Why, then, do you suppose that neurons communicate 
primarily through synapses rather than through gap 
junctions?

Question 20–13
Gelatin is primarily composed of collagen, which is 
responsible for the remarkable tensile strength of 
connective tissue. it is the basic ingredient of jello; yet, 
as you probably experienced many times yourself while 
consuming the strawberry-flavored variety, jello has virtually 
no tensile strength. Why?

Question 20–14
“the structure of an organism is determined by the genome 
that the egg contains.” What is the evidence on which this 
statement is based? indeed, a friend challenges you and 
suggests that you replace the dna of a stork’s egg with 
human dna to see if a human baby results. How would you 
answer him?

Question 20–15
leukemias—that is, cancers arising through mutations that 
cause excessive production of white blood cells—have an 
earlier average age of onset than other cancers. Propose an 
explanation for why this might be the case.

Question 20–16
carefully consider the graph in Figure Q20–16, showing 
the number of cases of colon cancer diagnosed per 100,000 
women per year as a function of age. Why is this graph 
so steep and curved, if mutations occur with a similar 
frequency throughout a person’s life-span?

Question 20–18
High levels of the female sex hormone estrogen increase 
the incidence of some forms of cancer. thus, some early 
types of contraceptive pills containing high concentrations 
of estrogen were eventually withdrawn from use because 
this was found to increase the risk of cancer of the 
lining of the uterus. male transsexuals who use estrogen 
preparations to give themselves a female appearance have 
an increased risk of breast cancer. High levels of androgens 
(male sex hormones) increase the risk of some other forms 
of cancer, such as cancer of the prostate. can one infer that 
estrogens and androgens are mutagenic?

Trying to define life in terms of properties 
is an elusive business, as suggested by this scoring exercise 
(Table A1–1). Vacuum cleaners are highly organized objects, 
and take matter and energy from the environment and 
transform the energy into motion, responding to stimuli 
from the operator as they do so. On the other hand, they 
cannot reproduce themselves, or grow and develop—but 
then neither can old animals. Potatoes are not particularly 
responsive to stimuli, and so on. It is curious that standard 
definitions of life usually do not mention that living 
organisms on Earth are largely made of organic molecules, 
that life is carbon based. As we now know, the key types of 
“informational macromolecules”—DNA, RNA, and protein—
are the same in every living species.

Answer 1–2  Most random changes to the shoe design 
would result in objectionable defects: shoes with multiple 
heels, with no soles, or with awkward sizes would obviously 
not sell and would therefore be selected against by market 
forces. Other changes would be neutral, such as minor 
variations in color or in size. A minority of changes, however, 
might result in more desirable shoes: deep scratches in a 
previously flat sole, for example, might create shoes that 
would perform better in wet conditions; the loss of high 
heels might produce shoes that are more comfortable. 
The example illustrates that random changes can lead to 
significant improvements if the number of trials is large 
enough and selective pressures are imposed.

a spore from the air landed in your broth, germinated, 
and gave rise to the cells you observed. In the middle of 
the nineteenth century, Louis Pasteur invented a clever 
apparatus to disprove the then widely accepted belief that 
life could arise spontaneously. He showed that sealed flasks 
never grew anything if properly heat-sterilized first. He 
overcame the objections of those who pointed out the lack 
of oxygen or who suggested that his heat sterilization killed 
the life-generating principle, by using a special flask with 
a slender “swan’s neck,” which was designed to prevent 
spores carried in the air from contaminating the culture 
(Figure A1–3). The cultures in these flasks never showed any 
signs of life; however, they were capable of supporting life, 
as could be demonstrated by washing some of the “dust” 
from the neck into the culture.

Answer 1–4 
would have the same mass as the Earth. And  
6 × 1039 = 2t/20, according to the equation describing 
exponential growth. Solving this equation for t results in 
t = 2642 minutes (or 44 hours). This represents only 132 
generation times(!), whereas 5 × 1014 bacterial generation 
times have passed during the last 3.5 billion years. 
Obviously, the total mass of bacteria on this planet is 
nowhere close to the mass of the Earth. This illustrates that 
exponential growth can occur only for very few generations, 
i.e., for minuscule periods of time compared with evolution. 
In any realistic scenario, food supplies very quickly become 
limiting.

This simple calculation shows us that the ability to grow

in the survival of a species. Food is generally scarce, and 
individuals of the same species have to compete with one 
another for the limited resources. Natural selection favors

on them efficiently. Bacteria, in contrast, have no way of 
capturing lumps of food; they can export substances that 
help break down food substances in the environment, but 
the products of this labor must then be shared with other 
cells in the same neighborhood.

Answer 1–6  Conventional light microscopy is much 
easier to use and requires much simpler instruments. 
Objects that are 1 μm in size can easily be resolved; the 
lower limit of resolution is 0.2 μm, which is a theoretical limit 
imposed by the wavelength of visible light. Visible light is 
nondestructive and passes readily through water, making 
it possible to observe living cells. Electron microscopy, on 
the other hand, is much more complicated, both in the 
preparation of the sample (which needs to be extremely 
thinly sliced, stained with electron-dense heavy metal, 
and completely dehydrated) and in the nature of the 
instrument. Living cells cannot be observed in an electron 
microscope. The resolution of electron microscopy is much 
higher, however, and biological objects as small as 1 nm 
can be resolved. To see any structural detail, microtubules, 
mitochondria, and bacteria would need to be analyzed by 
electron microscopy. It is possible, however, to stain them 
with specific dyes and then determine their location by light 
microscopy; if the dye is fluorescent, the stained objects can 
be seen with high resolution in a fluorescence microscope.

Answer 1–7 
Because the basic workings of cells are so 
similar, a great deal has been learned from studying model 
systems. Brewer’s yeast is a good model system, because 
yeast cells are much simpler than human cancer cells. We 
can grow cells inexpensively and in vast quantities, and we 
can manipulate them genetically and biochemically much 
more easily than human cells. This allows us to use yeast 
to decipher the ground rules governing how cells divide 
and grow. Cancer cells divide when they should not (and 
therefore give rise to tumors), and a basic understanding of 
how cell division is normally controlled is therefore directly 
relevant to the cancer problem. Indeed, the National Cancer 
Institute, the American Cancer Society, and many other 
institutions that are devoted to finding a cure for cancer 
strongly support basic research on various aspects of cell 
division in different model systems, including yeast.

A.  False. The hereditary information is encoded in the cell’s 

DNA, which in turn specifies its proteins (via RNA). 

B.  True. Bacteria do not have a nucleus. 
C.  False. Plants are composed of eukaryotic cells that 
contain chloroplasts as cytoplasmic organelles. The 
chloroplasts are thought to be evolutionarily derived 
from prokaryotic cells. 

D.  True. The number of chromosomes varies from one 

organism to another, but is constant in all cells (except 
germ cells) of the same organism. 

E.  False. The cytosol is the cytoplasm excluding all 

membrane-enclosed organelles. 

F.  True. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane, and 

mitochondria are surrounded by both an inner and an 
outer membrane. 

G.  False. Protozoans are single-celled organisms and 

therefore do not have different tissues or cell types. 

They have a complex structure, however, that has highly 
specialized parts. 

H.  Somewhat true. Peroxisomes and lysosomes contain 
enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of substances 
produced in the cytosol or taken up by the cell. One 
can argue, however, that many of these substances are 
degraded to generate food molecules, and as such are 
certainly not “unwanted.”

Answer 1–10  One average brain cell weighs 10–9 g 
(= 1000 g/1012). Because 1 g of water occupies 
1 ml = 1 cm3 (= 10–6 m3), the volume of one cell is 10–15 m3 
(= 10–9 g × 10–6 m3/g). Taking the cube root yields a side 
length of 10–5 m, or 10 μm (106 μm = 1 m) for each cell. The 
page of the book has a surface of 0.057 m2 (= 21 cm × 
27.5 cm), and each cell has a footprint of 10–10 m2 (10–5 m × 
10–5 m). Therefore, 57 × 107 (= 0.057 m2/10–10 m2) cells fit 
on this page when spread out as a single layer. Thus, 1012 
cells would occupy 1750 pages (= 1012/[57 × 107]).

bar is about 10 μm, the width of the nucleus.
Answer 1–12  The three major filaments are actin 
filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Actin 
filaments are involved in rapid cell movement, and are the 
most abundant filaments in a muscle cell; intermediate 
filaments provide mechanical stability and are the most 
abundant filaments in epidermal cells of the skin; and 
microtubules function as “railroad tracks” for intracellular 
movements, and are responsible for the separation of 
chromosomes during cell division. Other functions of all 
these filaments are discussed in Chapter 17.

Answer 1–13 
It takes only 20 hours, i.e., less than a day, 
before mutant cells become more abundant in the culture. 
Using the equation provided in the question, we see that 
the number of the original (“wild-type”) bacterial cells at 
time t minutes after the mutation occurred is 106 × 2t/20. 
The number of mutant cells at time t is 1 × 2t/15. To find out 
when the mutant cells “overtake” the wild-type cells, we 
simply have to make these two numbers equal to each other 
(i.e., 106 × 2t/20 = 2t/15). Taking the logarithm to base 10 of 
both sides of this equation and solving it for t results in 
t = 1200 minutes (or 20 hours). At this time, the culture 
contains 2 × 1024 cells (106 × 260 + 1 × 280). Incidentally, 
2 × 1024 bacterial cells, each weighing 10–12 g, would weigh 
2 × 1012 g (= 2 × 109 kg, or 2 million tons!). This can only 
have been a thought experiment.

Answer 1–14  Bacteria continually acquire mutations in 
their DNA. In the population of cells exposed to the poison, 
one or a few cells may harbor a mutation that makes them 
resistant to the action of the drug. Antibiotics that are 
poisonous to bacteria because they bind to certain bacterial 
proteins, for example, would not work if the proteins have a 
slightly changed surface so that binding occurs more weakly 
or not at all. These mutant bacteria would continue dividing 
rapidly while their cousins are slowed down. The antibiotic-
resistant bacteria would soon become the predominant 
species in the culture.

much more slowly, however, or die because of their internal 
abnormalities or because they do not have sufficient blood 
supply, and the actual progression of cancer is therefore 
usually slower.

Answer 1–16  Living cells evolved from nonliving 
matter, but grow and replicate. Like the material they 
originated from, they are governed by the laws of physics, 
thermodynamics, and chemistry. Thus, for example, they 
cannot create energy de novo or build ordered structures 
without the expenditure of free energy. We can understand 
virtually all cellular events, such as metabolism, catalysis, 
membrane assembly, and DNA replication, as complicated 
chemical reactions that can be experimentally reproduced, 
manipulated, and studied in test tubes. 

Despite this fundamental reducibility, a living cell is 

more than the sum of its parts. We cannot randomly mix 
proteins, nucleic acids, and other chemicals together in a 
test tube, for example, and make a cell. The cell functions 
by virtue of its organized structure, and this is a product of 
its evolutionary history. Cells always come from preexisting 
cells, and the division of a mother cell passes both chemical 
constituents and structures to its daughters. The plasma 
membrane, for example, never has to form de novo, but 
grows by expansion of a preexisting membrane; there will 
always be a ribosome, in part made up of proteins whose 
function it is to make more proteins, including those that 
build more ribosomes. 

In a multicellular organism, different 

Answer 1–17 
cells take on specialized functions and cooperate with one 
another, so that any one cell type does not have to perform 
all activities for itself. Through such divisions of labor, 
multicellular organisms are able to exploit food sources 
that are inaccessible to single-celled organisms. A plant, for 
example, can reach the soil with its roots to take up water 
and nutrients, while at the same time, its leaves above 
ground can harvest light energy and CO2 from the air. By 
protecting its reproductive cells with other specialized cells, 
the multicellular organism can develop new ways to survive 
in harsh environments or to fight off predators. When food 
runs out, it may be able to preserve its reproductive cells 
by allowing them to draw upon resources stored by their 
companions—or even to cannibalize relatives (a common 
process, in fact).

Answer 1–18  The volume and the surface area are 
5.24 × 10–19 m3 and 3.14 × 10–12 m2 for the bacterial 
cell, and 1.77 × 10–15 m3 and 7.07 × 10–10 m2 for the animal 
cell, respectively. From these numbers, the surface-to-
volume ratios are 6 × 106 m–1 and 4 × 105 m–1, respectively. 
In other words, although the animal cell has a 3375-fold 
larger volume, its membrane surface is increased only  
225-fold. If internal membranes are included in the 
calculation, however, the surface-to-volume ratios of 
both cells are about equal. Thus, because of their internal 
membranes, eukaryotic cells can grow bigger and still 
maintain a sufficiently large membrane area, which—as we 
shall discuss in more detail in later chapters—is required for 
many essential functions.
Answer 1–19  There are many lines of evidence for a 
common ancestor. Analyses of modern-day living cells show 
an amazing degree of similarity in the basic components 
that make up the inner workings of otherwise vastly 
different cells. Many metabolic pathways, for example, are 
conserved from one cell to another, and the compounds 
that make up nucleic acids and proteins are the same in all 
living cells, even though it is easy to imagine that a different 
choice of compounds (e.g., amino acids with different side 
chains) would have worked just as well. Similarly, it is not 
uncommon to find that important proteins have closely 
similar detailed structures in prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
cells. Theoretically, there would be many different ways 
to build proteins that could perform the same functions. 
The evidence overwhelmingly shows that most important 
processes were “invented” only once and then became 
fine-tuned during evolution to suit the particular needs of 
specialized cells and specific organisms.

It seems highly unlikely, however, that the first cell 

survived to become the primordial founder cell of today’s 
living world. As evolution is not a directed process with a 
purposeful progression, it is more likely that there were a 
vast number of unsuccessful trial cells that replicated for 
a while and then became extinct because they could not 
adapt to changes in the environment or could not survive 
in competition with other types of cells. We can therefore 
speculate that the primordial ancestor cell was a “lucky” cell 
that ended up in a relatively stable environment in which it 
had a chance to replicate and evolve.

Answers

Answer 1–21  A quick inspection might reveal beating 
cilia on the cell surface; their presence would tell you that 
the cell was eukaryotic. If you don’t see them—and you 
are quite likely not to—you will have to look for other 
distinguishing features. If you are lucky, you might see the 
cell divide. Watch it then with the right optics, and you 
might be able to see condensed mitotic chromosomes, 
which again would tell you that it was a eukaryote. Fix the 
cell and stain it with a dye for DNA: if this is contained in a 
well-defined nucleus, the cell is a eukaryote; if you cannot 
see a well-defined nucleus, the cell may be a prokaryote. 
Alternatively, stain it with fluorescent antibodies that bind 
actin or tubulin (proteins that are highly conserved in 
eukaryotes but absent in bacteria). Embed it, section it, and 
look with an electron microscope: can you see organelles 
such as mitochondria inside your cell? Try staining it with 
the Gram stain, which is specific for molecules in the cell 
wall of some classes of bacteria. But all these tests might 
fail, leaving you still uncertain. For a definitive answer, you 
could attempt to analyze the sequences of the DNA and 
RNA molecules that it contains, using the sophisticated 
methods described later in this book. The sequences of 
highly conserved molecules, such as those that form the 
core components of the ribosome, provide a molecular 
signature that can tell you whether your cell is a eukaryote, 
a bacterium, or an archaeon. If you can’t detect any RNA, 
you are probably looking not at a cell but at a piece of dirt.

The chances are excellent because of 
the enormous size of Avogadro’s number. The original 
cup contained one mole of water, or 6 × 1023 molecules, 
and the volume of the world’s oceans, converted to cubic 
centimeters, is 1.5 × 1024 cm3. After mixing, there should be 
on average 0.4 of an ancient water molecule per cm3 
(6 × 1023/1.5 × 1024), or 7.2 molecules in 18 g of Pacific 
Ocean.

Answer 2–2
A.  The atomic number is 6; the atomic weight is 12 

(= 6 protons + 6 neutrons).

B.  The number of electrons is six (= the number of protons).
C.  The first shell can accommodate two and the second 

shell eight electrons. Carbon therefore needs four 
additional electrons (or would have to give up four 
electrons) to obtain a full outermost shell. Carbon is 
most stable when it shares four additional electrons with 
other atoms (including other carbon atoms) by forming 
four covalent bonds.

D.  Carbon 14 has two additional neutrons in its nucleus. 

Because the chemical properties of an atom are 
determined by its electrons, the chemical behavior of 
carbon 14 is identical to that of carbon 12.

The statement is correct. Both ionic and 

Answer 2–3 
covalent bonds are based on the same principles: electrons 
can be shared equally between two interacting atoms, 
forming a nonpolar covalent bond; electrons can be shared 
unequally between two interacting atoms, forming a polar 
covalent bond; or electrons can be completely lost from one 
atom and gained by the other, forming an ionic bond. There 
are bonds of every conceivable intermediate state, and for 
borderline cases it becomes arbitrary whether a bond is 
described as a very polar covalent bond or an ionic bond.

The statement is correct. The hydrogen–

Answer 2–4 
oxygen bond in water molecules is polar, so that the oxygen 
atom carries a more negative charge than the hydrogen 
atoms. These partial negative charges are attracted to the 
positively charged sodium ions but are repelled from the 
negatively charged chloride ions.

Answer 2–5
A.  Hydronium (H3O+) ions result from water dissociating 
into protons and hydroxyl ions, each proton binding  
to a water molecule to form a hydronium ion  
(2H2O → H2O + H+ + OH– → H3O+ + OH–). At neutral 
pH, i.e., in the absence of an acid providing more 
H3O+ ions or a base providing more OH– ions, the 
concentrations of H3O+ ions and OH– ions are equal. We 
know that at neutrality the pH = 7.0, and therefore, the 
H+ concentration is 10–7 M. The H+ concentration equals 
the H3O+ concentration.

B.  To calculate the ratio of H3O+ ions to H2O molecules, we 
need to know the concentration of water molecules. The 
molecular weight of water is 18 (i.e., 18 g/mole), and  
1 liter of water weighs 1 kg. Therefore, the 
concentration of water is 55.6 M (= 1000 [g/l]/[18 g/
mole]), and the ratio of H3O+ ions to H2O molecules 
is 1.8 × 10–9 (= 10–7/55.6); i.e., fewer than two water 
molecules in a billion are dissociated at neutral pH.

Answer 2–6 
The synthesis of a macromolecule with a 
unique structure requires that in each amino acid position 
only one stereoisomer is used. Changing one amino acid 
from its L- to its D-form would result in a different protein. 
Thus, if for each amino acid a random mixture of the 
D- and L-forms were used to build a protein, its amino 
acid sequence could not specify a single structure, but 
many different structures (2N different structures would 
be formed, where N is the number of amino acids in the 
protein). 
   Why l-amino acids were selected in evolution as the 
exclusive building blocks of proteins is a mystery; we could 
easily imagine a cell in which certain (or even all) amino acids 
were used in the D-forms to build proteins, as long as these 
particular stereoisomers were used exclusively.

Answer 2–7 
The term “polarity” can be used in two 
ways. In one meaning, it refers to directional asymmetry—
for example, in linear polymers such as polypeptides 
(which have an N-terminus and a C-terminus) or nucleic 
acids (which have a 3ʹ and a 5ʹ end). Because the covalent 
bonds that link the subunits together form only between 
the amino and the carboxyl groups of the amino acids 
in a polypeptide, and between the 3ʹ and the 5ʹ ends of 
nucleotides in a nucleic acid, polypeptides and nucleic acids 
always have two different ends, which give the chain a 
defined chemical polarity. 
   In the other meaning, polarity refers to a separation of 
electric charge in a bond or molecule. This kind of polarity 
promotes hydrogen-bonding to water molecules, and 
because the water solubility, or hydrophilicity, of a molecule 
depends upon its being polar in this sense, the term “polar” 
also indicates water solubility.

Answer 2–8  A major advantage of condensation 
reactions is that they are readily reversible by hydrolysis 
(and water is readily available in the cell). This allows cells 
to break down their macromolecules (or macromolecules of 
other organisms that were ingested as food) and to recover 

the subunits intact so that they can be “recycled,” i.e., used 
to build new macromolecules.
Answer 2–9  Many of the functions that macromolecules 
perform rely on their ability to associate with and dissociate 
from other molecules readily. This allows cells, for example, 
to remodel their interior when they move or divide, and 
to transport components from one organelle to another. 
Covalent bonds would be too stable for such a purpose, 
requiring a specific enzyme to break each kind of bond.

Answer 2–10
A.  True. All nuclei are made of positively charged protons 

and uncharged neutrons; the only exception is the 
hydrogen nucleus, which consists of only one proton.
B.  False. Atoms are electrically neutral. The number of 
positively charged protons is always balanced by an 
equal number of negatively charged electrons.

C.  True—but only for the cell nucleus (see Chapter 1), and 

not for the atomic nucleus discussed in this chapter.

D.  False. Elements can have different isotopes, which differ 

only in their number of neutrons.

E.  True. In certain isotopes, the large number of neutrons 

destabilizes the nucleus, which decomposes in a process 
called radioactive decay.

F.  True. Examples include granules of glycogen, a polymer 
of glucose, found in liver cells; and fat droplets, made of 
aggregated triacylglycerols, found in fat cells.

G.  True. Individually, these bonds are weak and readily 
broken by thermal motion, but because interactions 
between two macromolecules involve a large number of 
such bonds, the overall binding can be quite strong, and 
because hydrogen bonds form only between correctly 
positioned groups on the interacting macromolecules, 
they are very specific.

Answer 2–11
A.  One cellulose molecule has a molecular weight of 

n × (12[C] + 2 × 1[H] + 16[O]). We do not know n, but 
we can determine the ratio with which the individual 
elements contribute to the weight of cellulose. The 
contribution of carbon atoms is 40% [= 12/(12 + 2 + 16) 
× 100%]. Therefore, 2 g (40% of 5 g) of carbon atoms 
are contained in the cellulose that makes up this page. 
The atomic weight of carbon is 12 g/mole, and there are 
6 × 1023 atoms or molecules in a mole. Therefore, 1023 
carbon atoms [= (2 g/12 [g/mole]) × 6 × 1023 (molecules/
mole)] make up this page.

B.  The volume of the page is 4 × 10–6 m3 (= 21.2 cm × 

27.6 cm × 0.07 mm), which is the same as the volume 
of a cube with a side length of 1.6 cm (= 3√4 × 10–6 m2). 
Because we know from part A that the page contains 
1023 carbon atoms, geometry tells us that there could be 
about 4.6 × 107 carbon atoms (= 3√1023) lined up along 
each side of this cube. Therefore, in cellulose, about 
200,000 carbon atoms (= 4.6 × 107 × 0.07  × 10–3 m/1.6 
× 10–2 m) span the thickness of the page.

C.  If tightly stacked, 350,000 carbon atoms with a  

0.2-nm diameter would span the 0.07-mm thickness of 
the page. 

D.  There are two reasons for the 1.7-fold difference in 
the two calculations: (1) carbon is not the only atom 
in cellulose; and (2) paper is not an atomic lattice of 
precisely arranged cellulose molecules (as a diamond 
would be for precisely arranged carbon atoms), but a 
random meshwork of fibers.

Answer 2–13  Whether a substance is a liquid or gas 
at a given temperature depends on the attractive forces 
between its molecules. H2S is a gas at room temperature 
and H2O is a liquid because the hydrogen bonds that 
hold H2O molecules together do not form between H2S 
molecules. A sulfur atom is much larger than an oxygen 
atom, and because of its larger size, the outermost 
electrons are not as strongly attracted to the nucleus of the 
sulfur atom as they are in an oxygen atom. Consequently, 
the hydrogen–sulfur bond is much less polar than the 
hydrogen–oxygen bond. Because of the reduced polarity, 
the sulfur in a H2S molecule is not strongly attracted to the 
hydrogen atoms in an adjacent H2S molecule, and hydrogen 
bonds, which are so predominant in water, do not form.

B.  A protein with a molecular weight of 4800 daltons is 

made of about 40 amino acids; thus there are 1.1 × 1052 
(= 2040) different ways to make such a protein. Each 
individual protein molecule weighs 8 × 10–21 g 
(= 4800/6 × 1023); thus a mixture of one molecule of 
each weighs 9 × 1031 g (= 8 × 10–21 g × 1.1 × 1052), 
which is 15,000 times the total weight of the planet 
Earth, weighing 6 × 1024 kg. You would need a quite 
large container, indeed.

C.  Given that most cell proteins are even larger than the 

one used in this example, it is clear that only a minuscule

Answer 2–17  Because all living cells are made up of 
chemicals and because all chemical reactions (whether 
in living cells or in test tubes) follow the same rules, an 
understanding of basic chemical principles is fundamentally 
important to the understanding of cell biology. For this 
reason, in later chapters, we will frequently refer back to 
these principles, on which all of the more complicated 
pathways and reactions that occur in cells are based.

Answer 2–18
A.  Hydrogen bonds form between two specific chemical 

groups; one is always a hydrogen atom linked in a polar 
covalent bond to an oxygen or a nitrogen atom, and 
the other is usually a nitrogen or an oxygen atom. Van 
der Waals attractions are weaker and occur between 
any two atoms that are in close enough proximity. 
Both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals attractions 
are short-range interactions that come into play only 
when two molecules are already in close proximity. Both 
types of bonds can therefore be thought of as means of 
“fine-tuning” an interaction, i.e., helping to position two 
molecules correctly with respect to each other once they 
have been brought together by diffusion.

B.  Van der Waals attractions would occur in all three 
examples. Hydrogen bonds would form only in (c).

Answer 2–19  Noncovalent bonds form between the 
covalently linked subunits of a macromolecule such as a 
polypeptide or RNA chain causing the chain to fold into a 
unique shape. These noncovalent bonds include hydrogen 
bonds, ionic interactions, van der Waals attractions, and 
hydrophobic interactions. Because these interactions 
are weak, they can be broken with relative ease; thus, 
most macromolecules can be unfolded by heating, which 
increases thermal motion.

Answer 2–20  Amphipathic molecules have both a 
hydrophilic and a hydrophobic end. Their hydrophilic 

end can hydrogen-bond to water, but their hydrophobic 
end is repelled from water because it interferes with the 
water structure. Consequently, the hydrophobic ends of 
amphipathic molecules tend to be exposed to air at air–
water interfaces, or, in the interior of an aqueous solution, 
they will always cluster together to minimize their contact 
with water molecules. (See Figure A2–20.)

accompanied by a greater increase in disorder, which

neighboring carbon atom, however, loses a hydrogen atom 
(i.e., an electron and a proton) and hence becomes oxidized. 
The red carbon atom in (D) becomes oxidized because it 
loses a hydrogen atom, whereas the red carbon atom in (E) 
becomes reduced because it gains a hydrogen atom.

Answer 3–3
A.  Both states of the coin, H and T, have an equal 

probability. There is therefore no driving force, i.e., 
no energy difference, that would favor H turning to 
T or vice versa. Therefore, ΔG° = 0 for this reaction. 
However, a reaction proceeds if H and T coins are not 
present in the box in equal numbers. In this case, the 
concentration difference between H and T creates a 
driving force and ΔG ≠ 0; when the reaction reaches 
equilibrium—i.e., when there are equal numbers of  
H and T—ΔG = 0. 

B.  The amount of shaking corresponds to the temperature, 

as it results in the “thermal” motion of the coins. The 
activation energy of the reaction is the energy that 
needs to be expended to flip the coin, i.e., to stand it 
on its rim, from where it can fall back facing either side 
up. Jigglase would speed up the flipping by lowering 
the energy required for this; it could, for example, be 
a magnet that is suspended above the box and helps 
lift the coins. Jigglase would not affect where the 
equilibrium lies (at an equal number of H and T), but it 
would speed up the process of reaching the equilibrium, 
because in the presence of jigglase more coins would flip 
back and forth.

See Figure A3–4. Note that ΔG°X → Y is 

Answer 3–4 
positive, whereas ΔG°Y → Z and ΔG°X → Z are negative. The 
graph also shows that ΔG°X → Z = ΔG°X → Y + ΔG°Y → Z. 
We do not know from the information given in Figure 
3–12 how high the activation energy barriers are; they are 
therefore drawn to an arbitrary height (solid lines). The 
activation energies would be lowered by enzymes that 
catalyze these reactions, thereby speeding up the reaction 
rates (dotted lines), but the enzymes would not change the 
ΔG° values.
Answer 3–5 
The reaction rates might be limited by 
(1) the concentration of the substrate, i.e., how often a 
molecule of CO2 collides with the active site on the enzyme; 
(2) how many of these collisions are energetic enough to 
lead to a reaction; and (3) how fast the enzyme can release

energy or from point B to infinite energy indicates the total 
number of molecules that will react without or with the 
enzyme, respectively. Although not drawn to scale, the ratio

Answer 3–6  All reactions are reversible. If the 
compound AB can dissociate to produce A and B, then it 
must also be possible for A and B to associate to form AB. 
Which of the two reactions predominates depends on the

supplying A and B in relatively large amounts and measuring 
the amount of AB generated. But suppose, however, that 
in the cell there is a large concentration of AB, in which 
case the enzyme would actually catalyze AB → A + B. 
(This question is based on an actual example in which an 
enzyme was isolated and named according to the reaction 
in one direction, but was later shown to catalyze the reverse 
reaction in living cells.)

Answer 3–7
A.  The rocks in Figure 3–30B provide the energy to  

lift the bucket of water. In the reaction  
X + ATP → Y + ADP + Pi, ATP hydrolysis is driving the 
reaction; thus ATP corresponds to the rocks on top of 
the cliff. The broken debris in Figure 3–30B corresponds 
to ADP and Pi, the products of ATP hydrolysis. In the 
reaction, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the conversion of 
X to Y. X, therefore, is the starting material, the bucket 
on the ground, which is converted to Y, the bucket at its 
highest point.

B.  (i) The rock hitting the ground would be the futile 
hydrolysis of ATP—for example, in the absence of 
an enzyme that uses the energy released by the ATP 
hydrolysis to drive an otherwise unfavorable reaction; 
in this case, the energy stored in the phosphoanhydride 
bond of ATP would be lost as heat. (ii) The energy 
stored in Y could be used to drive another reaction. If 
Y represented the activated form of amino acid X, for 
example, it could undergo a condensation reaction to 
form a peptide bond during protein synthesis.

The free energy ΔG derived from ATP 

Answer 3–8 
hydrolysis depends on both the ΔG° and the concentrations 
of the substrate and products. For example, for a particular 
set of concentrations, one might have 
ΔG = –12 kcal/mole = –7.3 kcal/mole + 0.616 ln [ADP] × [Pi]
                                                                                [ATP]
ΔG is smaller than ΔG°, largely because the ATP 
concentration in cells is high (in the millimolar range) and 
the ADP concentration is low (in the 10 μM range). The 
concentration term of this equation is therefore smaller than 
1 and its logarithm is a negative number. 
   ΔG° is a constant for the reaction and will not vary with 
reaction conditions. ΔG, in contrast, depends on the 
concentrations of ATP, ADP, and phosphate, which can be 
somewhat different between cells.

Reactions B, D, and E all require coupling 

Answer 3–9 
to other, energetically favorable reactions. In each 
case, higher-order structures are formed that are more 
complicated and have higher-energy bonds than the starting 
materials. In contrast, reaction A is a catabolic reaction that 
leads to compounds in a lower energy state and will occur 
spontaneously. The nucleoside triphosphates in reaction C 
contain enough energy to drive DNA synthesis (see Figure 
3–41).

Answer 3–10
A.  Nearly true, but strictly speaking, false. Because 
enzymes enhance the rate but do not change the 
equilibrium point of a reaction, a reaction will always 
occur in the absence of the enzyme, though often at a 
minuscule rate. Moreover, competing reactions may use 
up the substrate more quickly, thus further impeding 

the desired reaction. Thus, in practical terms, without 
an enzyme, some reactions may never occur to an 
appreciable extent.

B.  False. High-energy electrons are more easily transferred, 

i.e., more loosely bound to the donor molecule. This 
does not mean that they move any faster.

C.  True. Hydrolysis of an ATP molecule to form AMP also 

produces a pyrophosphate (PPi) molecule, which in turn 
is hydrolyzed into two phosphate molecules. This second 
reaction releases almost the same amount of energy 
as the initial hydrolysis of ATP, thereby approximately 
doubling the energy total yield.

D.  True. Oxidation is the removal of electrons, which 

reduces the diameter of the carbon atom.

E.  True. ATP, for example, can donate both chemical-bond 

energy and a phosphate group.

F.  False. Living cells have a particular kind of chemistry 
in which most oxidations are energy-releasing events; 
under different conditions, however, such as in a 
hydrogen-containing atmosphere, reductions would be 
energy-releasing events.

G.  False. All cells, including those of cold- and warm-

blooded animals, radiate comparable amounts of heat 
as a consequence of their metabolic reactions. For 
bacterial cells, for example, this becomes apparent when 
a compost pile heats up.

H.  False. The equilibrium constant of the reaction  

X ↔ Y remains unchanged. If Y is removed by a second 
reaction, more X is converted to Y so that the ratio of X 
to Y remains constant.

Answer 3–11  The free-energy difference (ΔG°) between 
Y and X due to three hydrogen bonds is  
–3 kcal/mole. (Note that the free energy of Y is lower than 
that of X, because energy would need to be expended to 
break the bonds to convert Y to X. The value for ΔG° for 
the transition X → Y is therefore negative.) The equilibrium 
constant for the reaction is therefore about 100 (from Table 
3–1, p. 98); i.e., there are about 100 times more molecules 
of Y than of X at equilibrium. An additional three hydrogen 
bonds would increase ΔG° to –6 kcal/mole and increase the 
equilibrium constant about another 100-fold to 104. Thus, 
relatively small differences in energy can have a major effect 
on equilibria.

Answer 3–12
A.  The equilibrium constant is defined as  

K = [AB]/([A] × [B]). The square brackets indicate the 
concentration. Thus, if A, B, and AB are each 1 μM 
(10–6 M), K will be 106 liters/mole [= 10–6/ (10–6 × 10–6)]. 

B.  Similarly, if A, B, and AB are each 1 nM (10–9 M), then 

K will be 109 liters/mole. 

C.  This example illustrates that interacting proteins that 

are present in cells in lower concentrations need to bind 
to each other with higher affinities so that a significant 
fraction of the molecules are bound at equilibrium. 
In this particular case, lowering the concentration by 
1000-fold (from μM to nM) requires an increase in the 
equilibrium constant by 1000-fold to maintain the AB 
protein complex in the same proportion (corresponding 
to –4.3 kcal of free energy; see Table 3–1). This 
corresponds to about four or five extra hydrogen bonds. 

Answer 3–13  The statement is correct. The criterion for 
whether a reaction proceeds spontaneously is ΔG, not ΔG°, 

Answers

A:9

and takes the concentrations of the reacting components 
into account. A reaction with a negative ΔG°, for example, 
would not proceed spontaneously under conditions where 
there is a large enough excess of products, i.e., more than 
at equilibrium. Conversely, a reaction with a positive ΔG° 
might spontaneously go forward under conditions where 
there is a huge excess of substrate.

Answer 3–14
A.  A maximum of 57 ATP molecules (= 686/12) corresponds 

to the total energy released by the complete oxidation 
of glucose to CO2 and H2O.

B.  The overall efficiency of ATP production would be about 

53%, calculated as the ratio of actually produced ATP 
molecules (30) divided by the number of ATP molecules 
that could be obtained if all the energy stored in a 
glucose molecule could be harvested as chemical energy 
in ATP (57). 

C.  During the oxidation of 1 mole of glucose, 322 kcal 
(the remaining 47% of the available 686 kcal in one 
mole of glucose that is not stored as chemical energy in 
ATP) would be released as heat. This amount of energy 
would heat your body by 4.3°C (= 322 kcal/75 kg). This 
is a significant amount of heat, considering that 4°C of 
elevated temperature would be a quite incapacitating 
fever and that 1 mole (180 g) of glucose is no more than 
two cups of sugar. 

D.  If the energy yield were only 20%, then instead of 47% in 

the example above, 80% of the available energy would 
be released as heat and would need to be dissipated by 
your body. The heat production would be more than  
1.7-fold higher than normal, and your body would 
certainly overheat.

E.  The chemical formula of ATP is C10H12O13N5P3, and its 
molecular weight is therefore 503 g/mole. Your resting 
body therefore hydrolyzes about 80 moles  
(= 40 kg/0.503 kg/mole) of ATP in 24 hours (this 
corresponds to about 1000 kcal of liberated chemical 
energy). Because every mole of glucose yields  
30 moles of ATP, this amount of energy could be 
produced by oxidation of 480 g glucose  
(= 180 g/mole × 80 moles/30).

Answer 3–15  This scientist is definitely a fake. The 
57 ATP molecules would store 684 kcal (= 57 × 12 kcal) of 
chemical energy, which implies that the efficiency of ATP 
production from glucose would have been greater than 
99%. This impossible degree of efficiency would leave 
virtually no energy to be released as heat, and this release is 
required according to the laws of thermodynamics.

Answer 3–16
A.  From Table 3–1 (p. 98) we know that a free-energy 

difference of 4.3 kcal/mole corresponds to an 
equilibrium constant of 10–3, i.e., [A*]/[A] = 10–3. The 
concentration of A* is therefore 1000-fold lower than 
that of A at equilibrium. 

B.  The ratio of A to A* would be unchanged. Lowering 
the activation energy barrier with an enzyme would 
accelerate the rate of the reaction, i.e., it would allow 
more molecules in a given time period to convert from  
A → A* and from A* → A, but it would not affect the 
ratio of A → A* at equilibrium. 

Answer 3–17
A.  The mutant mushroom would probably be safe 

to eat. ATP hydrolysis can provide approximately  
–12 kcal/mole of energy. This amount of energy  
shifts the equilibrium point of a reaction by an enormous 
factor: about 108-fold (from Table 3–1, 
p. 98, we see that –5.7 kcal/mole corresponds  
to an equilibrium constant of 104; thus, 
–12 kcal/mole corresponds to about 108. Note 
that, for coupled reactions, energies are additive, 
whereas equilibrium constants are multiplied). Therefore, 
if the energy of ATP hydrolysis cannot be utilized by 
the enzyme, 108-fold less poison is made. This example 
illustrates that coupling a reaction to the hydrolysis of an 
activated carrier molecule can shift the equilibrium point 
drastically. 

B.  It would be risky to consume this mutant mushroom. 

Slowing down the reaction rate would not affect its 
equilibrium point, and if the reaction were allowed to 
proceed for a long enough time, the mushroom would 
likely be loaded with poison. It is possible that the 
reaction would not reach equilibrium, but it would not 
be advisable to take a chance.

Answer 3–18  Enzyme A is beneficial. It allows the 
interconversion of two energy-carrier molecules, both 
of which are required as the triphosphate form for many 
metabolic reactions. Any ADP that is formed is quickly 
converted to ATP, and thus the cell maintains a high 
ATP/ADP ratio. Because of enzyme A, called nucleotide 
phosphokinase, some of the ATP is used to keep the  
GTP/GDP ratio similarly high. 
    Enzyme B would be highly detrimental to the cell. Cells 
use NAD+ as an electron acceptor in catabolic reactions 
and must maintain high concentrations of this form of the 
carrier as it is used in reactions that break down glucose to 
make ATP. In contrast, NADPH is used as an electron donor 
in biosynthetic reactions and is kept at high concentration 
in the cells so as to allow the synthesis of nucleotides, fatty 
acids, and other essential molecules. Since enzyme B would 
deplete the cell’s reserves of both NAD+ and NADPH, it 
would decrease the rates of both catabolic and biosynthetic 
reactions.
Answer 3–19  Because enzymes are catalysts, enzyme 
reactions have to be thermodynamically feasible; the 
enzyme only lowers the activation energy barrier that 
otherwise slows the rate with which the reaction occurs. 
Heat confers more kinetic energy to substrates so that a 
higher fraction of them can surmount the normal activation 
energy barrier. Many substrates, however, have many 
different ways in which they could react, and all of these 
potential pathways will be enhanced by heat. An enzyme, 
by contrast, acts selectively to facilitate only one particular 
pathway that, in evolution, was selected to be useful for the 
cell. Heat, therefore, cannot substitute for enzyme function, 
and chicken soup must exert its claimed beneficial effects by 
other mechanisms, which remain to be discovered. 

Answer 3–20
A.  When [S] << KM, the term ([S] + KM) approaches KM. 
Therefore, the equation is simplified to rate = Vmax[S]/
KM. Therefore, the rate is proportional to [S]. 

B.  When [S] = KM, the term [S]/([S] + KM) equals ½. 

Therefore, the reaction rate is half of the maximal rate 
Vmax. 

A:10 

Answers

C.  If [S] >> KM, the term ([S] + KM) approaches [S]. 

Therefore, [S]/([S] + KM) equals 1 and the reaction occurs 
at its maximal rate Vmax. 

Answer 3–21  The substrate concentration is 1 mM. 
This value can be obtained by substituting values in the 
equation, but it is simpler to note that the desired rate  
(50 μmole/sec) is exactly half of the maximum rate, Vmax, 
where the substrate concentration is typically equal to the 
KM. The two plots requested are shown in Figure A3–21. 
A plot of 1/rate versus 1/[S] is a straight line because 
rearranging the standard equation yields the equation listed 
in Question 3–23B.

If [S] is very much smaller than KM, the

active site of the enzyme is mostly unoccupied. If [S] is very 
much greater than KM, the reaction rate is limited by the 
enzyme concentration (because most of the catalytic sites 
are fully occupied).

Answer 3–23
A,B. The data in the boxes have been used to plot the red 

curve and red line in Figure A3–23. From the plotted 
data, the KM is 1 μM and the Vmax is 2 μmole/min. Note 
that the data are much easier to interpret in the linear 
plot, because the curve in (A) approaches, but never 
reaches, Vmax. 

C.  It is important that only a small quantity of product is 
made, because otherwise the rate of reaction would 
decrease as the substrate was depleted and product 
accumulated. Thus the measured rates would be lower 
than they should be. 

D.  If the KM increases, then the concentration of substrate 

needed to give a half-maximal rate is increased. As 
more substrate is needed to produce the same rate, 
the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has been inhibited by 
the phosphorylation. The expected data plots for the 

phosphorylated enzyme are the green curve and the 
green line in Figure A3–23.

Answer 4–1  Urea is a very small organic molecule 
that functions both as an efficient hydrogen-bond donor 
(through its –NH2 groups) and as an efficient hydrogen-bond 
acceptor (through its –C=O group). As such, it can squeeze 
between hydrogen bonds that stabilize protein molecules 
and thus destabilize protein structures. In addition, the 
nonpolar side chains of a protein are held together in 
the interior of the folded structure because they would 
disrupt the structure of water if they were exposed. At 
high concentrations of urea, the hydrogen-bonded network 
of water molecules becomes disrupted so that these 
hydrophobic forces are significantly diminished. Proteins 
unfold in urea as a consequence of its effect on these two 
forces.

Answer 4–2 
The amino acid sequence consists of 
alternating nonpolar and charged or polar amino acids. 
The resulting strand in a β sheet would therefore be polar 
on one side and hydrophobic on the other. Such a strand 
would probably be surrounded on either side by similar 

strands that together form a β sheet with a hydrophobic 
face and a polar face. In a protein, such a β sheet (called 
“amphipathic,” from the Greek amphi, “of both kinds,” 
and pathos, “passion,” because of its two surfaces with 
such different properties) would be positioned so that the 
hydrophobic side would face the protein’s interior and the 
polar side would be on its surface, exposed to the water 
outside. 

Answer 4–3  Mutations that are beneficial to an 
organism are selected in evolution because they confer 
a reproductive or survival advantage to the organism. 
Examples might be the better utilization of a food source, 
enhanced resistance to environmental insults, or an 
enhanced ability to attract a mate for sexual reproduction. 
In contrast, useless proteins are detrimental to organisms, 
as the metabolic energy required to make them is a wasted 
cost. If such mutant proteins were made in excess, the 
synthesis of normal proteins would suffer because the 
synthetic capacity of the cell is limited. In more severe 
cases, a mutant protein could interfere with the normal 
workings of the cell; a mutant enzyme that still binds an 
activated carrier molecule but does not catalyze a reaction, 
for example, may compete for a limited amount of this 
carrier and therefore inhibit normal processes. Natural 
selection therefore provides a strong driving force that 
eliminates both useless and harmful proteins.

Answer 4–4 
Strong reducing agents that break all of

Indeed, strong reducing agents are used commercially in

Answer 4–6
A.  Feedback inhibition from Z that affects the reaction  

ess2 EA5.06/4.

B → C would increase the flow through the B → X → 
Y → Z pathway, because the conversion of B to C is 
inhibited. Thus, the more Z there is, the more production 
of Z would be stimulated. This is likely to result in an 
uncontrolled “runaway” amplification of this pathway. 
B.  Feedback inhibition from Z affecting Y → Z would only 
inhibit the production of Z. In this scheme, however, X 
and Y would still be made at normal rates, even though 
both of these intermediates are no longer needed at this 
level. This pathway is therefore less efficient than the 
one shown in Figure 4–38. 

C.  If Z is a positive regulator of the step B → X, then the 
more Z there is, the more B will be converted to X and 
therefore shunted into the pathway producing more Z. 
This would result in a runaway amplification similar to 
that described for (A). 

D.  If Z is a positive regulator of the step B → C, then 

accumulation of Z leads to a redirection of the pathway 
to make more C. This is a second possible way, in 
addition to that shown in the figure, to balance the 
distribution of compounds into the two branches of the 
pathway. 

Both nucleotide binding and 

Answer 4–7 
phosphorylation can induce allosteric changes in proteins. 
These can have a multitude of consequences, such as 
altered enzyme activity, drastic shape changes, and changes 
in affinity for other proteins or small molecules. Both 
mechanisms are quite versatile. An advantage of nucleotide 
binding is the fast rate with which a small nucleotide 
can diffuse to the protein; the shape changes that 
accompany the function of motor proteins, for example, 
require quick nucleotide replenishment. If the different 
conformational states of a motor protein were controlled 
by phosphorylation, for example, a protein kinase would 
either need to diffuse into position at each step, a much 
slower process, or be associated permanently with each 
motor protein. One advantage of phosphorylation is that it 
requires only a single amino acid on the protein’s surface, 
rather than a specific binding site. Phosphates can therefore 

A:12 

Answers

be added to many different side chains on the same protein 
(as long as protein kinases with the proper specificities 
exist), thereby vastly increasing the complexity of regulation 
that can be achieved for a single protein.

Answer 4–8 
In working together in a complex, all three 
proteins contribute to the specificity (by binding to the safe 
and key directly). They help position one another correctly, 
and provide the mechanical bracing that allows them to 
perform a task that they could not perform individually 
(the key is grasped by two of the proteins, for example). 
Moreover, their functions are generally coordinated in time 
(for instance, the binding of ATP to one subunit is likely to 
require that ATP has already been hydrolyzed to ADP by 
another).

The α helix is right-handed. The three 

Answer 4–9 
strands that form the large β sheet are antiparallel. There 
are no knots in the polypeptide chain, presumably because 
a knot would interfere with the folding of the protein into its 
three-dimensional conformation after protein synthesis. 

Answer 4–10
A.  True. Only a few amino acid side chains contribute to the 
active site. The rest of the protein is required to maintain 
the polypeptide chain in the correct conformation, 
provide additional binding sites for regulatory purposes, 
and localize the protein in the cell.

B.  True. Some enzymes form covalent intermediates with 

their substrates (see middle panels of Figure 4–35); 
however, in all cases the enzyme is restored to its 
original structure after the reaction. 

C.  False. β sheets can, in principle, contain any number of 
strands because the two strands that form the rims of 
the sheet are available for hydrogen-bonding to other 
strands. (β sheets in known proteins contain from 2 to 16 
strands.)

D.  False. It is true that the specificity of an antibody 

molecule is exclusively contained in polypeptide loops 
on its surface; however, these loops are contributed by 
both the folded light and heavy chains (see Figure 4–33). 

E.  False. The possible linear arrangements of amino acids 
that lead to a stably folded protein domain are so few 
that most new proteins evolve by alteration of old ones. 

F.  True. Allosteric enzymes generally bind one or more 
molecules that function as regulators at sites that are 
distinct from the active site. 

G.  False. Although single noncovalent bonds are 

weak, many such bonds acting together are a major 
contributor to the three-dimensional structure of 
macromolecules.

H.  False. Affinity chromatography separates specific 
macromolecules because of their interactions with 
specific ligands, not because of their charge. 

I.  False. The larger an organelle is, the more centrifugal 

force it experiences and the faster it sediments, despite 
an increased frictional resistance from the fluid through 
which it moves. 

In an α helix and in the central strands 

Answer 4–11 
of a β sheet, all of the N  –H and C=O groups in the 
polypeptide backbone are engaged in hydrogen bonds. This 
gives considerable stability to these secondary structural 
elements, and it allows them to form in many different 
proteins. 

Answer 4–12  No. It would not have the same or even a 
similar structure, because the peptide bond has a polarity. 
Looking at two sequential amino acids in a polypeptide 
chain, the amino acid that is closer to the N-terminal end 
contributes the carboxyl group and the other amino acid 
contributes the amino group to the peptide bond that 
links the two amino acids. Changing their order would 
put the side chains into different positions with respect to 
the peptide backbone and therefore change the way the 
polypeptide folds.

Answer 4–13  As it takes 3.6 amino acid residues to 
complete a turn of an α helix, this sequence of 14 amino 
acids would make close to 4 full turns. It is remarkable 
because its polar and hydrophobic amino acids are spaced 
so that all the polar ones are on one side of the α helix 
and all the hydrophobic residues are on the other. It is 
therefore likely that such an amphipathic α helix is exposed 
on the protein surface with its hydrophobic side facing the 
protein’s interior. In addition, two such helices might wrap 
around each other as shown in Figure 4–16.

Answer 4–14
A.  ES represents the enzyme–substrate complex. 
B.  Enzyme and substrate are in equilibrium between their 

free and bound states; once bound to the enzyme, a 
substrate molecule may either dissociate again (hence 
the bidirectional arrows) or be converted to product. 
As the substrate is converted to product (with the 
concomitant release of free energy), however, a reaction 
usually proceeds strongly in the forward direction, as 
indicated by the unidirectional arrow.

C.  The enzyme is a catalyst and is therefore liberated in an 

unchanged form after the reaction; thus,  
E appears at both ends of the equation. 

D.  Often, the product of a reaction resembles the substrate 

sufficiently that it can also bind to the enzyme. Any 
enzyme molecules that are bound to the product (i.e., 
are part of the EP complex) are unavailable for catalysis; 
excess P therefore inhibits the reaction by lowering the 
concentration of free E. 

E.  Compound X would act as an inhibitor of the reaction 

and work similarly by forming an EX complex. However, 
since P has to be made before it can inhibit the reaction, 
it takes longer to act than X, which is present from the 
beginning of the reaction.

Answer 4–15  The polar amino acids Ser, Ser-P, Lys, Gln, 
His, and Glu are more likely to be found on a protein’s 
surface, and the hydrophobic amino acids Leu, Phe, Val, 
Ile, and Met are more likely to be found in its interior. 
The oxidation of two cysteine residues to form a disulfide 
bond eliminates their potential to form hydrogen bonds 
and therefore makes them even more hydrophobic; thus 
disulfide bonds are usually found in the interior of proteins. 
Irrespective of the nature of their side chains, the most 
N-terminal amino acid and the most C-terminal amino acid 
each contain a charged group (the amino and carboxyl 
groups, respectively, that mark the ends of the polypeptide 
chain) and hence are usually found on the protein’s surface.

Answer 4–16  Many secondary structural elements are 
not stable in isolation but are stabilized by other parts of the 
polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic regions of fragments, which 
would normally be hidden in the inside of a folded protein, 

would be exposed to water in an aqueous solution; such 
fragments would tend to aggregate nonspecifically, and not 
have a defined structure, and they would be inactive for 
ligand binding, even if they contained all of the amino acids 
that would normally contribute to the ligand-binding site. A 
protein domain, in contrast, is considered a folding unit, and 
fragments of a polypeptide chain that correspond to intact 
domains are often able to fold correctly. Thus, separated 
protein domains often retain their activities, such as ligand 
binding, if the binding site is contained entirely within the 
domain. Thus the most likely place in which the polypeptide 
chain of the protein in Figure 4–19 could be severed to give 
rise to stable fragments is at the boundary between the two 
domains (i.e., at the loop between the two α helices at the 
bottom right of the structure shown).

Answer 4–17  Because of the lack of secondary structure, 
the C-terminal region of neurofilament proteins undergoes 
continual Brownian motion. The high density of negatively 
charged phosphate groups means that the C-terminals 
also experience repulsive interactions, which cause 
them to stand out from the surface of the neurofilament 
like the bristles of a brush. In electron micrographs of 
a cross section of an axon, the region occupied by the 
extended C-terminals appears as a clear zone around 
each neurofilament, from which organelles and other 
neurofilaments are excluded.

Answer 4–18  The heat-inactivation of the enzyme 
suggests that the mutation causes the enzyme to have a 
less stable structure. For example, a hydrogen bond that 
is normally formed between two amino acid side chains 
might no longer be formed because the mutation replaces 
one of these amino acids with a different one that cannot 
participate in the bond. Lacking such a bond that normally 
helps to keep the polypeptide chain folded properly, the 
protein partially or completely unfolds at a temperature at 
which it would normally be stable. Polypeptide chains that 
denature when the temperature is raised often aggregate, 
and they rarely refold into active proteins when the 
temperature is decreased.

Answer 4–19  The motor protein in the illustration can 
move just as easily to the left as to the right and so will not 
move steadily in one direction. However, if just one of the 
steps is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (for example, by making 
detachment of one foot dependent on binding of ATP and 
coupling the reattachment to hydrolysis of the bound ATP), 
then the protein will show unidirectional movement that 
requires the continued consumption of ATP. Note that, in 
principle, it does not matter which step is coupled to ATP 
hydrolysis (Figure A4–19).

molecules have access to many more spaces in the porous 
beads that are packed into the column than do larger 
molecules. However, it is important that the flow rate 
through the column is slow enough to give the smaller 
molecules sufficient time to diffuse into the spaces inside 
the beads. At very rapid flow rates, all molecules will move 
rapidly around the beads, so that large and small molecules 
will now tend to exit together from the column.
Answer 4–21  The α helix in the figure is right-handed, 
whereas the coiled-coil is left-handed. The reversal occurs 
because of the staggered positions of hydrophobic side 
chains in the α helix.
Answer 4–22  The atoms at the binding sites of proteins 
must be precisely located to fit the molecules that they 
bind. Their location in turn requires the precise positioning 
of many of the amino acids and their side chains in the core 
of the protein, distant from the binding site itself. Thus, 
even a small change in this core can disrupt protein function 
by altering the conformation at a binding site far away.

A.  False. The polarity of a DNA strand commonly refers to 

the orientation of its sugar–phosphate backbone, one

B.  True. G-C base pairs are held together by three

Answer 5–2  Histone octamers occupy about 9% of the 
volume of the nucleus. The volume of the nucleus is 
   V = 4/3 × 3.14 × (3 × 103 nm)3
   V = 1.13 × 1011 nm3
The volume of the histone octamers is
   V = 3.14 × (4.5 nm)2 × (5 nm) × (32 × 106)
   V = 1.02 × 1010 nm3
The ratio of the volume of histone octamers to the nuclear 
volume is 0.09; thus, histone octamers occupy about 9% of 
the nuclear volume. Because the DNA also occupies about 
9% of the nuclear volume, together they occupy about 18% 
of the volume of the nucleus.

In contrast to most proteins, which 

Answer 5–3 
accumulate amino acid changes over evolutionary time, 
the functions of histone proteins must involve nearly all of 
their amino acids, so that a change in any position would be 
deleterious to the cell.

Answer 5–4  Men have only one copy of the X 
chromosome in their cells; a defective gene carried on it 
therefore has no backup copy. Women, on the other hand, 
have two copies of the X chromosome in their cells, one 
inherited from each parent, so a defective copy of the 
gene on one X chromosome can generally be compensated 
for by a normal copy on the other chromosome. This 
is the case with regard to the gene that causes color 
blindness. However, during female development, one X 
chromosome in each cell is inactivated by compaction into 

A:14 

Answers

heterochromatin, shutting down gene expression from that 
chromosome (see Figure 5–30). This occurs at random in 
each cell to one or the other of the two X chromosomes, 
and therefore some cells of the woman will express the 
mutant copy of the gene, whereas others will express the 
normal copy. This results in a retina in which on average only 
every other cone cell is color sensitive, and women carrying 
the mutant gene on one X chromosome therefore see 
colored objects with reduced resolution.  
   A woman who is color-blind must have two defective 
copies of this gene, one inherited from each parent. 
Her father must therefore carry the mutation on his X 
chromosome; because this is his only copy of the gene, he 
would be color-blind. Her mother could carry the defective 
gene on either or both of her X chromosomes: if she carried 
it on both, she would be color-blind; if she carried it on 
one, she would have color vision but reduced resolution, as 
described above. Several different types of inherited color 
blindness are found in the human population; this question 
applies to only one type.

Answer 5–5
A.  The complementary strand reads 

5ʹ-TGATTGTGGACAAAAATCC-3ʹ. Paired DNA strands have 
opposite polarity, and the convention is to write a single-
stranded DNA sequence in the 5ʹ-to-3ʹ direction.

B.  The DNA is made of four nucleotides (100% = 13% A + 

x% T + y% G + z% C). Because A pairs with T, the two 
nucleotides are represented in equimolar proportions in 
DNA. Therefore, the bacterial DNA in question contains 
13% thymidine. This leaves 74% [= 100% – (13% + 13%)] 
for G and C, which also form base pairs and hence are 
equimolar. Thus y = z = 74/2 = 37.

C.  A single-stranded DNA molecule that is N nucleotides 
long can have any one of 4N possible sequences, but 
the number of possible double-stranded DNA molecules 
is more difficult to calculate. Many of the 4N single-
stranded sequences will be the complement of another 
possible sequence in the list; for example, 5ʹ-AGTCC-3ʹ 
and 5ʹ-GGACT-3ʹ form the same double-stranded DNA 
molecule and therefore count as a single, double-
stranded possibility. If N is an odd number, then every 
single-stranded sequence will complement another 
sequence in the list so that the number of double-
stranded sequences will be 0.5 × 4N. If N is an even 
number, then there will be slightly more than this, since 
some sequences will be self-complementary (such as 
5ʹ-ACTAGT-3ʹ) and the actual value can be calculated to 
be 0.5 × 4N + 0.5 × 4N/2.

D.  To specify a unique sequence which is N nucleotides 

long, 4N has to be larger than 3 × 106. Thus, 
4N > 3 × 106, solved for N, gives N > ln(3 × 106)/
ln(4) = 10.7. Thus, on average, a sequence of only 
11 nucleotides in length is unique in the genome. 
Performing the same calculation for the genome size of 
an animal cell yields a minimal stretch of 16 nucleotides. 
This shows that a relatively short sequence can mark 
a unique position in the genome and is sufficient, for 
example, to serve as an identity tag for one specific 
gene.

Answer 5–6 
incorporated during DNA replication, genetic information 
could not be inherited accurately. Life, as we know it, could 

If the wrong bases were frequently 

not exist. Although the bases can form hydrogen-bonded 
pairs as indicated, these do not fit into the structure of the 
double helix. The angle with which the A residue is attached 
to the sugar–phosphate backbone is vastly different in 
the A-C pair, and the spacing between the two sugar–
phosphate strands is considerably increased in the A-G pair, 
where two large purine rings interact. Consequently, it is 
energetically unfavorable to incorporate a wrong base in 
DNA, and such errors occur only very rarely.

Answer 5–7
A.  The bases V, W, X, and Y can form a DNA-like double-
helical molecule with virtually identical properties to 
those of bona fide DNA. V would always pair with X, 
and W with Y. Therefore, the macromolecules could 
be derived from a living organism that uses the same 
principles to replicate its genome as those used by 
organisms on Earth. In principle, different bases, such 
as V, W, X, and Y, could have been selected during 
evolution on Earth as building blocks for DNA. (Similarly, 
there are many more conceivable amino acid side chains 
than the set of 20 selected in evolution that make up all 
proteins.) 

B.  None of the bases V, W, X, or Y can replace A, T, G, or 

C. To preserve the distance between the two sugar– 
phosphate strands in a double helix, a pyrimidine always 
has to pair with a purine (see, for example, Figure 5–6). 
Thus, the eight possible combinations would be V-A, 
V-G, W-A, W-G, X-C, X-T, Y-C, and Y-T. Because of the 
positions of hydrogen-bond acceptors and hydrogen-
bond donor groups, however, no stable base pairs would 
form in any of these combinations, as shown for the 
pairing of V and A in Figure A5–7, where only a single 
hydrogen bond could form.

Answer 5–8  As the two strands are held together 
by hydrogen bonds between the bases, the stability of a 
DNA double helix is largely dependent on the number of 
hydrogen bonds that can be formed. Thus two parameters 
determine the stability: the number of nucleotide pairs and 
the number of hydrogen bonds that each nucleotide pair 

contributes. As shown in Figure 5–6, an A-T pair contributes 
two hydrogen bonds, whereas a G-C pair contributes three 
hydrogen bonds. Therefore, helix C (containing a total of 
34 hydrogen bonds) would melt at the lowest temperature, 
helix B (containing a total of 65 hydrogen bonds) would melt 
next, and helix A (containing a total of 78 hydrogen bonds) 
would melt last. Helix A is the most stable, largely owing 
to its high GC content. Indeed, the DNA of organisms that 
grow in extreme temperature environments, such as certain 
prokaryotes that grow in geothermal vents, has an unusually 
high GC content.

The DNA would be enlarged by a factor 

Answer 5–9 
of 2.5 × 106 (= 5 × 10–3/2 × 10–9 m). Thus the extension 
cord would be 2500 km long. This is approximately the 
distance from London to Istanbul, San Francisco to Kansas 
City, Tokyo to the southern tip of Taiwan, and Melbourne to 
Cairns. Adjacent nucleotides would be about 0.85 mm apart 
(which is only about the thickness of a stack of 12 pages of 
this book). A gene that is 1000 nucleotide pairs long would 
be about 85 cm in length.

Answer 5–10
A.  It takes two bits to specify each nucleotide pair (for 

example, 00, 01, 10, and 11 would be the binary codes 
for the four different nucleotides, each paired with its 
appropriate partner).

B.  The entire human genome (3 × 109 nucleotide pairs) 

could be stored on two CDs (3 × 109 × 2 bits/4.8 × 109

Answer 5–11
A.  True.
B.  False. Nucleosome core particles are approximately  

11 nm in diameter.

Answer 5–12  The definitions of the terms can be 
found in the Glossary. DNA assembles with specialized 
proteins to form chromatin. At a first level of packing, 
histones form the core of nucleosomes. In a nucleosome, 
the DNA is wrapped almost twice around this core. 
Between nuclear divisions—that is, in interphase—the 
chromatin of the interphase chromosomes is in a relatively 
extended form in the nucleus, although some regions of 
it, the heterochromatin, remain densely packed and are 
transcriptionally inactive. During nuclear division—that is, in 
mitosis—replicated chromosomes become condensed into 
mitotic chromosomes, which are transcriptionally inactive 
and are designed to be readily distributed between the two 
daughter cells. 

Answer 5–13  Colonies are clumps of cells that originate 
from a single founder cell and grow outward as the cells 
divide again and again. In the lower colony of Figure Q5–13, 
the Ade2 gene is inactivated when placed near a telomere, 
but apparently it can become spontaneously activated in a 
few cells, which then turn white. Once activated in a cell, the 
Ade2 gene continues to be active in the descendants of that 
cell, resulting in clumps of white cells (the white sectors) 
in the colony. This result shows both that the inactivation 
of a gene positioned close to a telomere can be reversed 
and that this change is passed on to further generations. 
This change in Ade2 expression probably results from a 
spontaneous decondensation of the chromatin structure 
around the gene.

In the electron micrographs, one can

detect chromatin regions of two different densities; the 
densely stained regions correspond to heterochromatin, 
while less condensed chromatin is more lightly stained. 
The chromatin in A is mostly in the form of condensed, 
transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin, whereas most 
of the chromatin in B is decondensed and therefore 
potentially transcriptionally active. The nucleus in A is 
from a reticulocyte, a red blood cell precursor, which is 
largely devoted to making a single protein, hemoglobin. 
The nucleus in B is from a lymphocyte, which is active in 
transcribing many different genes.

Answer 5–15  Helix A is right-handed. Helix C is left-
handed. Helix B has one right-handed strand and one 
left-handed strand. There are several ways to tell the 
handedness of a helix. For a vertically oriented helix, like 
the ones in Figure Q5–15, if the strands in front point up 
to the right, the helix is right-handed; if they point up to 
the left, the helix is left-handed. Once you are comfortable 
identifying the handedness of a helix, you will be amused 
to note that nearly 50% of the “DNA” helices shown 
in advertisements are left-handed, as are a surprisingly 
high number of the ones shown in books. Amazingly, 
a version of Helix B was used in advertisements for a 
prominent international conference, celebrating the 30-year 
anniversary of the discovery of the DNA helix.

Answer 5–16  The packing ratio within a nucleosome 
core is 4.5 [(147 bp × 0.34 nm/bp)/(11 nm) = 4.5]. If there 
is an additional 54 bp of linker DNA, then the packing ratio 
for “beads-on-a-string” DNA is 2.3 [(201 bp × 0.34 nm/
bp)/(11 nm + {54 bp × 0.34 nm/bp}) = 2.3]. This first level 
of packing represents only 0.023% (2.3/10,000) of the total 
condensation that occurs at mitosis.

Answer 6–1
A.  The distance between replication forks 4 and 5 is about 

280 nm, corresponding to 824 nucleotides  
(= 280/0.34). These two replication forks would collide 
in about 8 seconds. Forks 7 and 8 move away from each 
other and would therefore never collide. 

B.  The total length of DNA shown in the electron 

micrograph is about 1.5 μm, corresponding to 4400 
nucleotides. This is only about 0.002% [= (4400/1.8 × 
108) × 100%] of the total DNA in a fly cell.

Answer 6–2  Although the process may seem wasteful, 
it is not possible to proofread during the initial stages of 
primer synthesis. To start a new primer on a piece of single-
stranded DNA, one nucleotide needs to be put in place 
and then linked to a second and then to a third, and so on. 
Even if these first nucleotides were perfectly matched to 
the template strand, they would bind with very low affinity, 
and it would consequently be difficult to distinguish the 
correct from incorrect bases by a hypothetical primase with 
proofreading activity; the enzyme would therefore stall. The 
task of the primase is to “just polymerize nucleotides that 
bind reasonably well to the template without worrying too 
much about accuracy.” Later, these sequences are removed 
and replaced by DNA polymerase, which uses newly 
synthesized (and therefore proofread) DNA as its primer.

Answer 6–4  DNA damage by deamination and 
depurination reactions occurs spontaneously. This type 
of damage is not the result of replication errors and is 
therefore equally likely to occur on either strand. If DNA 
repair enzymes recognized such damage only on newly 
synthesized DNA strands, half of the defects would go 
uncorrected. The statement is therefore incorrect.

Answer 6–5 
If the old strand were “repaired” using the 
new strand that contains a replication error as the template, 
then the error would become a permanent mutation in 
the genome. The old information would be erased in the

between the two strands, there would be only a 50% chance 
that any given replication error would be corrected. 

The argument is severely flawed. You

cannot transform one species into another simply by 
introducing random changes into the DNA. It is exceedingly 
unlikely that the 5000 mutations that would accumulate 
every day in the absence of the DNA repair enzyme would 
be in the very positions where human and chimpanzee 
DNA sequences are different. It is very likely that, at such 
a high mutation frequency, many essential genes would be 
inactivated, leading to cell death. Furthermore, your body is 
made up of about 1013 cells. For you to turn into an ape, not 
just one but many of these cells would need to be changed. 
And even then, many of these changes would have to occur 
during development to effect changes in your body plan 
(making your arms longer than your legs, for example).

A.  False. Identical DNA polymerase molecules catalyze 

DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands 
of a bacterial replication fork. The replication fork is 
asymmetrical because the lagging strand is synthesized

B.  False. Only the RNA primers are removed by an RNA

cancer. 

Answer 6–8  With a single origin of replication, which 
launches two DNA polymerases in opposite directions on 
the DNA, each moving at 100 nucleotides per second, the 
number of nucleotides replicated in 24 hours will be  
1.73 × 107 (= 2 × 100 × 24 × 60 × 60). To replicate all the 
6 × 109 nucleotides of DNA in the cell in this time, 
therefore, will require at least 348 (= 6 × 109/1.73 × 107) 
origins of replication. The estimated 10,000 origins of 
replication in the human genome are therefore more than 
enough to satisfy this minimum requirement. 

Answer 6–9
A.  Dideoxycytosine triphosphate (ddCTP) is identical 

to dCTP, except it lacks the 3ʹ-hydroxyl group on the 
sugar ring. ddCTP is recognized by DNA polymerase 
as dCTP and becomes incorporated into DNA; because 
it lacks the crucial 3ʹ-hydroxyl group, however, its 
addition to a growing DNA strand creates a dead end 
to which no further nucleotides can be added. Thus, 
if ddCTP is added in large excess, new DNA strands 
will be synthesized until the first G (the nucleotide 
complementary to C) is encountered on the template 
strand. ddCTP will then be incorporated instead of C, 
and the extension of this strand will be terminated. 

B.  If ddCTP is added at about 10% of the concentration 
of the available dCTP, there is a 1 in 10 chance of its 
being incorporated whenever a G is encountered 
on the template strand. Thus a population of DNA 
fragments will be synthesized, and from their lengths 
one can deduce where the G residues are located on 
the template strand. This strategy forms the basis of 
methods used to determine the sequence of nucleotides 
in a stretch of DNA (discussed in Chapter 10). 
   The same chemical phenomenon is exploited by a 
drug, 3ʹ-azido-3ʹ-deoxythymidine (AZT), that is now 
commonly used in HIV-infected patients to treat AIDS. 
AZT is converted in cells to the triphosphate form and 
is incorporated into the growing viral DNA. Because 
the drug lacks a 3ʹ-OH group, it blocks DNA synthesis 
and replication of the virus. AZT inhibits viral replication 
preferentially because reverse transcriptase has a higher 
affinity for the drug than for thymidine triphosphate; 
human cellular DNA polymerases do not show this 
preference.

C.  Dideoxycytosine monophosphate (ddCMP) lacks the 

5ʹ-triphosphate group as well as the 3ʹ-hydroxyl group 
of the sugar ring. It therefore cannot provide the energy 
that drives the polymerization reaction of nucleotides 
into DNA and therefore will not be incorporated into the 
replicating DNA. Addition of this compound should not 
affect DNA replication.

nucleoside triphosphates into DNA, two phosphoanhydride 
bonds are broken for each nucleotide added: the nucleoside 
triphosphate is hydrolyzed to produce the nucleoside 
monophosphate added to the growing DNA strand, and 
the released pyrophosphate is hydrolyzed to phosphate. 
Therefore, 1.2 × 107 high-energy bonds are hydrolyzed 
during each round of bacterial DNA replication. This 
requires 4 × 105 (= 1.2 × 107/30) glucose molecules, which 
weigh 1.2 × 10–16 g (= 4 × 105 molecules × 180 g/mole/
6 × 1023 molecules/mole), which is 0.01% of the total weight 
of the cell.

Answer 6–12  The statement is correct. If the DNA 
in somatic cells is not sufficiently stable (that is, if it 
accumulates mutations too rapidly), the organism dies (of 
cancer, for example), and because this may often happen 
before the organism can reproduce, the species will die out. 
If the DNA in reproductive cells is not sufficiently stable, 
many mutations will accumulate and be passed on to future 
generations, so that the species will not be maintained.

Answer 6–13  As shown in Figure A6–13, thymine 
and uracil lack amino groups and therefore cannot be 
deaminated. Deamination of adenine and guanine produces 

Figure A6–13

purine rings that are not found in conventional nucleic 
acids. In contrast, deamination of cytosine produces uracil. 
Therefore, if uracil were a naturally occurring base in DNA 
(as it is in RNA), repair enzymes could not distinguish 
whether a uracil is the appropriate base or whether it arose 
through spontaneous deamination of cytosine. This dilemma 
is not encountered, however, because thymine, rather than 
uracil, is used in DNA. Therefore, if a uracil base is found in 
DNA, it can be automatically recognized as a damaged base 
and then excised and replaced by cytosine.

Answer 6–14
A.  Because DNA polymerase requires a 3ʹ-OH to synthesize 

DNA, without telomeres and telomerase, the ends of 
linear chromosomes would shrink during each round 
of DNA replication (Figure A6–14). For bacterial 
chromosomes, which have no ends, the problem does 
not arise; there will always be a 3ʹ-OH group available 
to prime the DNA polymerase that replaces the RNA 
primer with DNA. Telomeres and telomerase prevent the 
shrinking of chromosomes because they extend the  
3ʹ end of a DNA strand (see Figure 6–22). This extension 
of the lagging-strand template provides the “space” to 
begin the final Okazaki fragments.

B.  As shown in Figure A6–14, telomeres and telomerase 

are still needed even if the last fragment of the lagging 
strand were initiated by primase at the very 3ʹ end of 
chromosomal DNA, inasmuch as the RNA primer must 
be removed.

Answer 6–15
A.  If the single origin of replication were located exactly in 
the center of the chromosome, it would take more than 
8 days to replicate the DNA [= 75 × 106 nucleotides/
(100 nucleotides/sec)]. The rate of replication would 
therefore severely limit the rate of cell division. If the 
origin were located at one end, the time required to 
replicate the chromosome would be approximately 
double this.

B.  A chromosome end that is not “capped” with a telomere 

would lose nucleotides during each round of DNA 
replication and would gradually shrink. Eventually, 
essential genes would be lost, and the chromosome’s 
ends might be recognized by the DNA damage-response 
mechanisms, which would stop cell division or induce cell 
death. 

C.  Without centromeres, which attach mitotic chromosomes 

to the mitotic spindle, the two new chromosomes that 
result from chromosome duplication would not be 
partitioned accurately between the two daughter cells. 
Therefore, many daughter cells would die, because they 
would not receive a full set of chromosomes.

Answer 6–16 The addition of each nucleotide by a 
hypothetical polymerase that synthesized DNA in the 
reverse 3ʹ-to-5ʹ direction would require the energy provided 
by hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate bond at the  
5ʹ end of the growing chain—rather than at the 5ʹ end of 
the incoming nucleotide, as do the actual DNA polymerases. 
If an incorrectly incorporated nucleotide were removed  
from such a growing chain, DNA synthesis would grind to a 
halt, as there would be no high-energy bonds remaining at 
the 5ʹ end of the chain to fuel further polymerization (see 
Figure A6–16).

Perhaps the best answer was given by 

Answer 7–1 
Francis Crick himself, who coined the term in the mid-1950s: 
“I called this idea the central dogma for two reasons, I 
suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis 
in the sequence hypothesis, which proposes that genetic 
information is encoded in the sequence of the DNA 
bases, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new 
assumption was more central and more powerful…. As it 
turned out, the use of the word dogma caused more trouble 
than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed 
out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct 
use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be 
doubted. I did appreciate this in a vague sort of way but 
since I thought that all religious beliefs were without serious 
foundation, I used the word in the way I myself thought 
about it, not as the world does, and simply applied it to a 
grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct 
experimental support at the time.” (Francis Crick, What Mad 
Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery. Basic Books, 
1988.)

Answer 7–2  Actually, the RNA polymerases are not 
moving at all in the micrograph, because they have been 
fixed and coated with metal to prepare the sample for 

viewing in the electron microscope. However, before they 
were fixed, they were moving from left to right, as indicated 
by the gradual lengthening of the RNA transcripts. 
   The RNA transcripts are shorter because they begin to 
fold up (i.e., to acquire a three-dimensional structure) as 
they are synthesized (see, for example, Figure 7–5), whereas 
the DNA is an extended double helix.

Answer 7–3  At first glance, the catalytic activities of 
an RNA polymerase used for transcription could replace 
the DNA primase. Upon further reflection, however, there 
are some serious problems. (1) The RNA polymerase used 
to make primers would need to initiate every few hundred 
bases, which is much more often than promoters are spaced 
on the DNA. Initiation would therefore need to occur in a 
promoter-independent fashion or many more promoters 
would have to be present in the DNA, both of which would 
be problematic for the control of transcription. (2) Similarly, 
the RNA primers used in DNA replication are much shorter 
than mRNAs. The RNA polymerase would therefore need to 
terminate much more frequently than during transcription. 
Termination would need to occur spontaneously, i.e., 
without requiring a terminator sequence in the DNA, or 
many more terminators would need to be present. Again, 
both of these scenarios would be problematic for the 
control of transcription.  
   Although it might be possible to overcome this problem 
if special control proteins became attached to RNA 
polymerase during replication, the problem has been solved 
during evolution by using separate enzymes with specialized 
properties. Some small DNA viruses, however, do utilize 
the host RNA polymerase to make DNA primers for their 
replication.

Answer 7–4 
ribosome does not check the amino acid that is attached to 
a tRNA. Once an amino acid has been coupled to a tRNA, 
the ribosome will “blindly” incorporate that amino acid into 
the position according to the match between the codon 
and anticodon. We can therefore conclude that a significant 
part of the correct reading of the genetic code, i.e., the 
matching of a codon in an mRNA with the correct amino 
acid, is performed by the synthetase enzymes that correctly 
match tRNAs and amino acids.
Answer 7–5 
opposite to that of the DNA strand that serves as 
the template. Thus the mRNA sequence will read 
5ʹ-GAAAAAAGCCGUUAA-3ʹ. The N-terminal amino acid 
coded for by GAA is glutamic acid. UAA specifies a stop 
codon, so the C-terminal amino acid is coded for by CGU 
and is an arginine. Note that the convention in describing 
the sequence of a gene is to give the sequence of the DNA 
strand that is not used as a template for RNA synthesis; this 
sequence is the same as that of the RNA transcript, with  
T written in place of U.
Answer 7–6 
RNA is thought to have been the first self-replicating 
catalyst and, in modern cells, is no longer self-replicating. 
We can debate, however, whether this represents a “loss.” 
RNA now serves many roles in the cell: as messengers, 
as adaptors for protein synthesis, as primers for DNA 
replication, and as catalysts for some of the most 
fundamental reactions, especially RNA splicing and protein 
synthesis.

The first statement is probably correct: 

Answers

A:19

Answer 7–7
A.  False. Ribosomes can make any protein that is specified 
by the particular mRNA that they are translating. After 
translation, ribosomes are released from the mRNA and 
can then start translating a different mRNA. It is true, 
however, that a ribosome can only make one type of 
protein at a time.

B.  False. mRNAs are translated as linear polymers; there 
is no requirement that they have any particular folded 
structure. In fact, such structures that are formed by 
mRNA can inhibit its translation, because the ribosome 
has to unfold the mRNA in order to read the message it 
contains. 

C.  False. Ribosomal subunits exchange partners after each 
round of translation. After a ribosome is released from 
an mRNA, its two subunits dissociate and enter a pool of 
free small and large subunits from which new ribosomes 
assemble around a new mRNA. 

D.  False. Ribosomes are cytoplasmic organelles, but they 

are not individually enclosed in a membrane. 

E.  False. The position of the promoter determines the 

direction in which transcription proceeds and therefore 
which DNA strand is used as the template. Transcription 
in the opposite direction would produce an mRNA 
with a completely different (and probably meaningless) 
sequence. 

F.  False. RNA contains uracil but not thymine. 
G.  False. The level of a protein depends on its rate of 
synthesis and degradation but not on its catalytic 
activity.

Answer 7–8 
Because the deletion in the Lacheinmal 
mRNA is internal, it is likely that the deletion arises from 
an mRNA splicing defect. The simplest interpretation is 
that the Lacheinmal gene contains a 173-nucleotide-long 
exon (labeled “E2” in Figure A7–8), and that this exon is 
lost during the processing of the mutant precursor mRNA 
(pre-mRNA). This could occur, for example, if the mutation 
changed the 3ʹ splice site in the preceding intron (“I1”) so 
that it was no longer recognized by the splicing machinery 
(a change in the CAG sequence shown in Figure 7–19 could 
do this). The snRNP would search for the next available 3ʹ 
splice site, which is found at the 3ʹ end of the next intron 
(“I2”), and the splicing reaction would therefore remove E2 
together with I1 and I2, resulting in a shortened mRNA. The 
mRNA is then translated into a defective protein, resulting 
in the Lacheinmal deficiency.  
   Because 173 nucleotides do not amount to an integral 
number of codons, the lack of this exon in the mRNA will 
shift the reading frame at the splice junction. Therefore, the 
Lacheinmal protein would be made correctly only through 
exon E1. As the ribosome begins translating sequences in 
exon E3, it will be in a different reading frame and therefore 
will produce a protein sequence that is unrelated to the 
Lacheinmal sequence normally encoded by exon E3. Most 
likely, the ribosome will soon encounter a stop codon, 
which in RNA sequences that do not code for protein would 
be expected to occur on average about once in every 21 
codons (there are 3 stop codons in the 64 codons of the 
genetic code). 

Answer 7–9 
Sequence 1 and sequence 4 both code 
for the peptide Arg-Gly-Asp. Because the genetic code is 
redundant, different nucleotide sequences can encode the 
same amino acid sequence.

A.  Incorrect. The bonds are not covalent, and their

B.  Correct. The aminoacyl-tRNA enters the ribosome at the 
A site and forms hydrogen bonds with the codon in the 
mRNA.

C.  Correct. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, 

ECB2 EA7.09/

the tRNAs that have donated their amino acid to 
the growing polypeptide chain are ejected from the 
ribosome and the mRNA. The ejection takes place two 
cycles after the tRNA first enters the ribosome (see 
Figure 7–34).

Answer 7–11  Replication. Dictionary definition: the 
creation of an exact copy; molecular biology definition: 
the act of duplicating DNA. Transcription. Dictionary 
definition: the act of writing out a copy, especially from one 
physical form to another; molecular biology definition: the 
act of copying the information stored in DNA into RNA. 
Translation. Dictionary definition: the act of putting words 
into a different language; molecular biology definition: 
the act of polymerizing amino acids into a defined linear 
sequence using the information provided by the linear 
sequence of nucleotides in mRNA. (Note that “translation” 
is also used in a quite different sense, both in ordinary 
language and in scientific contexts, to mean a movement 
from one place to another.)

Answer 7–12  With four different nucleotides to choose 
from, a code of two nucleotides could specify 16 different 
amino acids (= 42), and a triplet code in which the position 
of the nucleotides is not important could specify 20 different 
amino acids (= 4 possibilities of 3 of the same bases + 

12 possibilities of 2 bases the same and one different + 
4 possibilities of 3 different bases). In both cases, these 
maximal amino acid numbers would need to be reduced by 
at least 1, because of the need to specify translation stop 
codons. It is relatively easy to envision how a doublet code 
could be translated by a mechanism similar to that used in 
our world by providing tRNAs with only two relevant bases 
in the anticodon loop. It is more difficult to envision how 
the nucleotide composition of a stretch of three nucleotides 
could be translated without regard to their order, because 
base-pairing can then no longer be used: AUG, for example, 
will not base-pair with the same anticodon as UGA.

It is likely that in early cells the matching 

Answer 7–13 
between codons and amino acids was less accurate than 
it is in present-day cells. The feature of the genetic code 
described in the question may have allowed early cells to 
tolerate this inaccuracy by allowing a blurred relationship 
between sets of roughly similar codons and roughly similar 
amino acids. One can easily imagine how the matching 
between codons and amino acids could have become more 
accurate, step by step, as the translation machinery evolved 
into that found in modern cells.
Answer 7–14  The codon for Trp is 5ʹ-UGG-3ʹ. Thus 
a normal Trp-tRNA contains the sequence 5ʹ-CCA-3ʹ as 
its anticodon (see Figure 7–30). If this tRNA contains a 
mutation so that its anticodon is changed to UCA, it will 
recognize a UGA codon and lead to the incorporation of a 
tryptophan residue instead of causing translation to stop. 
Many other protein-encoding sequences, however, contain 
UGA codons as their natural stop sites, and these stops 
would also be affected by the mutant tRNA. Depending on 
the competition between the altered tRNA and the normal 
translation release factors (Figure 7–38), some of these 
proteins would be made with additional amino acids at their 
C-terminal end. The additional lengths would depend on the 
number of codons before the ribosomes encounter a non-
UGA stop codon in the mRNA in the reading frame in which 
the protein is translated.

Answer 7–15  One effective way of driving a reaction to 
completion is to remove one of the products, so that the 
reverse reaction cannot occur. ATP contains two high-energy 
bonds that link the three phosphate groups. In the reaction 
shown, PPi is released, consisting of two phosphate groups 
linked by one of these high-energy bonds. Thus PPi can be 
hydrolyzed with a considerable gain of free energy, and 
thereby can be efficiently removed. This happens rapidly in 
cells, and reactions that produce and further hydrolyze PPi 
are therefore virtually irreversible (see Figure 3–40).

Answer 7–16
A.  A titin molecule is made of 25,000 (3,000,000/120) amino 

acids. It therefore takes about 3.5 hours [(25,000/2 )× 
(1/60) × (1/60)] to synthesize a single molecule of titin in 
muscle cells.

B.  Because of its large size, the probability of making a titin 

molecule without any mistakes is only 0.08  
[= (1 – 10–4)25,000]; i.e., only 8 in 100 titin molecules 
synthesized are free of mistakes. In contrast, over 97% 
of newly synthesized proteins of average size are made 
correctly.

C.  The error rate limits the sizes of proteins that can 
be synthesized accurately. Similarly, if a eukaryotic 

ribosomal protein were synthesized as a single molecule, 
a large portion (87%) of this hypothetical giant ribosomal 
protein would be expected to contain at least one 
mistake. It is therefore more advantageous to make 
ribosomal proteins individually, because in this way 
only a small proportion of each type of protein will 
be defective, and these few bad molecules can be 
individually eliminated by proteolysis to ensure that 
there are no defects in the ribosome as a whole.

D.  To calculate the time it takes to transcribe a titin mRNA, 

you would need to know the size of its gene, which is 
likely to contain many introns. Transcription of the exons 
alone (25,000 × 3 = 75,000 nucleotides) requires about 
42 minutes [(75,000/30) × (1/60)]. Because introns can 
be quite large, the time required to transcribe the entire 
gene is likely to be considerably longer.

Answer 7–17  Mutations of the type described in 
(B) and (D) are often the most harmful. In both cases, 
the reading frame would be changed, and because this 
frameshift occurs near the beginning or in the middle of 
the coding sequence, much of the protein will contain a 
nonsensical and/or truncated sequence of amino acids. In 
contrast, a reading-frame shift that occurs toward the end 
of the coding sequence, as described in (A), will result in a 
largely correct protein that may be functional. Deletion of 
three consecutive nucleotides, as described in (C), leads 
to the deletion of an amino acid but does not alter the 
reading frame. The deleted amino acid may or may not 
be important for the folding or activity of the protein; in 
many cases such mutations are silent, i.e., have no or only 
minor consequences for the organism. Substitution of 
one nucleotide for another, as in (E), is often completely 
harmless. In some cases, it will not change the amino acid 
sequence of the protein; in other cases it will change a 
single amino acid; at worst, it may create a new stop codon, 
giving rise to a truncated protein.

A.  Transcription of the tryptophan operon would no longer 
be regulated by the absence or presence of tryptophan; 
the enzymes would be permanently turned on in

scenario (3).

B.  In scenarios (1) and (2), the normal tryptophan repressor 

molecules would completely restore the regulation 
of the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes. In contrast, 
expression of the normal protein would have no effect 
in scenario (3), because the tryptophan operator would 
remain occupied by the mutant protein, even in the 
presence of tryptophan.

A.  UV light throws the switch from the prophage to the 

lytic state: when cI protein is destroyed, Cro is made and 
turns off the further production of cI. The virus produces 
coat proteins, and new virus particles are made.

B.  When the UV light is switched off, the virus remains in 
the lytic state. Thus, cI and Cro form a gene regulatory 
switch that “memorizes” its previous setting.

C.  This switch makes sense in the viral life cycle: UV light 
tends to damage the bacterial DNA (see Figure 6–24), 
thereby rendering the bacterium an unreliable host for 
the virus. A prophage will therefore switch to the lytic 
state and leave the “sinking ship” in search for new host 
cells to infect.

Answer 8–5
A.  True. Prokaryotic mRNAs are often transcripts of entire 
operons. Ribosomes can initiate translation at internal 
AUG start sites of these “polycistronic” mRNAs (see 
Figures 7–36 and 8–6). 

B.  True. The major groove of double-stranded DNA is 
sufficiently wide to allow a protein surface, such as 
one face of an α helix, access to the base pairs. The 
sequence of H-bond donors and acceptors in the major 
groove can then be “read” by the protein to determine 
the sequence and orientation of the DNA.

C.  True. It is advantageous to exert control at the earliest

energy because unnecessary products are not made in

would expect their function to be relatively independent of 
their distance from the promoter—possibly weakening as 
this distance increases. The surprising feature of the data 
(which have been adapted from an actual experiment) is 
the periodicity: the enhancer is maximally active at certain 
distances from the promoter (50, 60, or 70 nucleotides), 
but almost inactive at intermediate distances (55 or 65 
nucleotides). The periodicity of 10 suggests that the mystery 
can be explained by considering the structure of double-
helical DNA, which has 10 base pairs per turn. Thus, placing

The affinity of the dimeric λ repressor 

Answer 8–7 
for its binding site is the sum of the interactions made by 
each of the two DNA-binding domains. A single DNA-
binding domain can make only half the contacts and provide 
just half the binding energy compared with the dimer. 
Thus, although the concentration of binding domains is 
unchanged, they are no longer coupled, and their individual 
affinities for DNA are sufficiently weak that they cannot 
remain bound. As a result, the genes for lytic growth are 
turned on.

The function of these Arg genes is to 

Answer 8–8 
synthesize arginine. When arginine is abundant, expression 
of the biosynthetic genes should be turned off. If ArgR acts 
as a gene repressor (which it does in reality), then binding 
of arginine should increase its affinity for its regulatory 
sites, allowing it to bind and shut off gene expression. If 
ArgR acted as a gene activator instead, then the binding 
of arginine would be predicted to reduce its affinity for its 
regulatory DNA, preventing its binding and thereby shutting 
off expression of the Arg genes.

looping, which should not be affected by the protein bridge 
(so long as it allowed the DNA to bend, which it does). The 
scanning or entry-site model, however, is predicted to be 
affected by the nature of the linkage between the enhancer 
and the promoter. If the proteins enter at the enhancer 
and scan to the promoter, they would have to traverse the 
protein linkage. If such proteins are geared to scan on DNA, 
they would likely have difficulty scanning across such a 
barrier.

Answer 8–10  The most definitive result is one showing 
that a single differentiated cell taken from a specialized

Experiments of this type are summarized in Figure 8–2.

by adding an additional transcription regulator). MyoD by 
itself is sufficient to induce muscle-specific gene expression 
only in certain cell types, such as some kinds of fibroblasts. 
The action of MyoD is therefore consistent with the model 
shown in Figure 8–17: if muscle cells were specified, for 
example, by the combination of transcription regulators

only two of the cell types of Figure 8–17 (cells F and H) to

protein that stimulates its own synthesis can create a 
positive feedback loop that can produce cell memory. 
The continued self-stimulated synthesis of activator A can 
in principle last for many cell generations, serving as a 
constant reminder of an event that took place in the past. 
By contrast, the induction of a transcriptional repressor that 
inhibits its own synthesis creates a negative feedback loop 
which ensures that the response to the transient stimulus 
will be similarly transient. Because repressor R shuts off its 

Answers

A:23

own synthesis, the cell will quickly return to the state that 
existed before the signal.

Answer 8–13  Many transcription regulators are 
continually made in the cell; that is, their expression is 
constitutive and the activity of the protein is controlled by 
signals from inside or outside the cell (e.g., the availability 
of nutrients, as for the tryptophan repressor, or by 
hormones, as for the glucocorticoid receptor), thereby 
adjusting the transcriptional program to the physiological 
needs of the cell. Moreover, a given transcription 
regulator usually controls the expression of many different 
genes. Transcription regulators are often used in various 
combinations and can affect each other’s activity, thereby 
further increasing the possibilities for regulation with a 
limited set of proteins. Nevertheless, most cells devote 
a large fraction of their genomes to the control of 
transcription: about 10% of genes in eukaryotic cells code 
for transcription regulators.

Answer 9–1  When it comes to genetic information, a 
balance must be struck between stability and change. If the 
mutation rate were too high, a species would eventually die 
out because all its individuals would accumulate mutations 
in genes essential for survival. And for a species to be 
successful—in evolutionary terms—individual members must 
have a good genetic memory; that is, there must be high 
fidelity in DNA replication. At the same time, occasional 
changes are needed if the species is to adapt to changing 
conditions. If the change leads to an improvement, it 
will persist by selection; if it is neutral, it may or may 
not accumulate; but if the change proves disastrous, the 
individual organism that was the unfortunate subject of 
nature’s experiment will die, but the species will survive.

Answer 9–2 
In single-celled organisms, the genome is 
the germ line and any modification is passed on to the next 
generation. By contrast, in multicellular organisms, most 
of the cells are somatic cells and make no contribution to 
the next generation; thus, modification of those cells by 
horizontal gene transfer would have no consequence for the 
next generation. The germ-line cells are usually sequestered 
in the interior of multicellular organisms, minimizing their 
contact with foreign cells, viruses, and DNA, thus insulating 
the species from the effects of horizontal gene transfer. 
Nevertheless, horizontal gene transfer is possible for 
multicellular organisms. For example, the genomes of some 
insect species contain DNA that was horizontally transferred 
from bacteria that infect them.

It is unlikely that any gene came into 

Answer 9–3 
existence perfectly optimized for its function. Ribosomal 
RNA genes presumably varied a great deal when they 
first appeared on Earth. But this would have been at the 
very early stage of a common ancestral cell (see Figure 
9–23). Since then there has been much less leeway for 
change since ribosomal RNA (and other highly conserved 
genes) play such a fundamental role in living processes. 
Nonetheless, the environment an organism finds itself in is 
changeable, so no gene can be optimal indefinitely. Thus 
we find there are indeed significant differences in ribosomal 
RNAs among species.

Answer 9–4  Each time another copy of a transposon 
is inserted into a chromosome, the change can be either 
neutral, beneficial, or detrimental for the organism. Because 
individuals that accumulate detrimental insertions would 
be selected against, the proliferation of transposons is 
controlled by natural selection. If a transposon arose that 
proliferated uncontrollably, it is unlikely that a viable host 
organism could be maintained. For this reason, most 
transposons have evolved to transpose only rarely. Many 
transposons, for example, synthesize only infrequent bursts 
of very small amounts of the transposase that is required for 
their movement. 

Viruses cannot exist as free-living 

Answer 9–5 
organisms: they have no metabolism, do not communicate 
with other viruses, and cannot reproduce themselves. 
They thus have none of the attributes that one normally 
associates with life. Indeed, they can even be crystallized. 
Only inside cells can they redirect normal cellular 
biosynthetic activities to the task of making more copies of 
themselves. Thus, the only aspect of “living” that viruses 
display is their capacity to direct their own reproduction 
once inside a cell.

Answer 9–6  Mobile genetic elements could provide 
opportunities for homologous recombination events, 
thereby causing genomic rearrangements. They could 
insert into genes, possibly obliterating splicing signals and 
thereby changing the protein produced by the gene. They 
could also insert into the regulatory region of a gene, where 
insertion between an enhancer and a transcription start 
site could block the function of the enhancer and therefore 
reduce the level of expression of a gene. In addition, the 
mobile genetic element could itself contain an enhancer and 
thereby change the time and place in the organism where 
the gene is expressed.

Answer 9–7  With their ability to facilitate genetic 
recombination, mobile genetic elements have almost 
certainly played an important part in the evolution of 
modern-day organisms. They can facilitate gene duplication 
and the creation of new genes via exon shuffling, and they 
can change the way in which existing genes are expressed. 
Although the transposition of a mobile genetic element 
can be harmful for an individual organism—if, for example, 
it disrupts the activity of a critical gene—these agents of 
genetic change may well be beneficial to the species as a 
whole.

Answer 9–8  About 7.6% of each gene is converted 
to mRNA [(5.4 exons/gene × 266 nucleotide pairs/exon)/
(19,000 nucleotide pairs/gene) = 7.6%]. Protein-coding 
genes occupy about 28% of Chromosome 22 [(700 genes × 
19,000 nucleotide pairs/gene)/(48 × 106 nucleotide pairs) = 
27.7%]. However, over 90% of this DNA is made of introns.

Answer 9–9 
This statement is probably true. For 
example, nearly half our DNA is composed of defunct 
mobile genetic elements. And only about 9% of the human 
genome appears to be under positive selection. However, 
it is possible that future research will uncover a function for 
some portion of our seemingly unimportant DNA.

Answer 9–10  The HoxD cluster is packed with complex 
and extensive regulatory sequences that direct each of its 
genes to be expressed at the correct time and place during 
development. Insertion of mobile genetic elements into the

HoxD cluster is thought to be selected against because it 
would disrupt proper regulation of its resident genes.

Answer 9–11
A.  The exons in the human β-globin gene correspond to 

the positions of sequence similarity (in this case identity) 
with the cDNA, which is a direct copy of the mRNA and 
thus contains no introns. The introns correspond to the 
regions between the exons. The positions of the introns 
and exons in the human β-globin gene are indicated 
in Figure A9–11A. Also shown (in open bars) are 
sequences present in the mature β-globin mRNA (and in 
the gene) that are not translated into protein.

B.  From the positions of the exons, as defined in Figure 

A9–11A, it is clear that the first two exons of the 
human β-globin gene have counterparts, with similar 
sequence, in the mouse β-globin gene (Figure A9–11B). 
However, only the first half of the third exon of the 
human β-globin gene is similar to the mouse β-globin 
gene. The similar portion of the third exon contains 
sequences that encode protein, whereas the portion 
that is different represents the 3ʹ untranslated region 
of the gene. Because this portion of the gene does not 
encode protein (nor does it contain extensive regulatory 
sequences), its sequence is not constrained and the 
mouse and human sequences have drifted apart.

C.  The human and mouse β-globin genes are also similar at 
their 5ʹ ends, as indicated by the cluster of points along 
the same diagonal as the first exon (Figure A9–11B). 
These sequences correspond to the regulatory regions 
upstream of the start sites for transcription. Functional 
sequences, which are under selective pressure, diverge 
much more slowly than sequences without function.

D.  The diagon plot shows that the first intron is nearly the 

same length in the human and mouse genes, but the 
length of the second intron is noticeably different (Figure 
A9–11B). If the introns were the same length, the line 
segments that represent sequence similarity would fall 
on the same diagonal. The easiest way to test for the 
colinearity of the line segments is to tilt the page and 
sight along the diagonal. It is impossible to tell from this 
comparison if the change in length is due to a shortening 
of the mouse intron or to a lengthening of the human 
intron, or some combination of those possibilities.

Answer 9–12  Computer algorithms that search for 
exons are complex affairs, as you might imagine. To identify 
unknown genes, these programs combine statistical 
information derived from known genes, such as:
1.  An exon that encodes protein will have an open reading 

frame. If the amino acid sequence specified by this 

open reading frame matches a protein sequence in any 
database, there is a high likelihood that it is an authentic 
exon.

2.  The reading frames of adjacent exons in the same gene 

will match up when the intron sequences are omitted.

3.  Internal exons (excluding the first and the last) will have 

splicing signals at each end; most of the time (98.1%) 
these will be AG at the 5ʹ ends of the exons and GT at 
the 3ʹ ends.

4.  The multiple codons for most individual amino acids are 

not used with equal frequency. This so-called coding 
bias can be factored in to aid in the recognition of true 
exons.

5.  Exons and introns have characteristic length 

distributions. The median length of exons in human 
genes is about 120 nucleotide pairs. Introns tend to be 
much larger: a median length of about 2 kb in genomic 
regions of 30–40% GC content, and a median length of 
about 500 nucleotide pairs in regions above 50% GC.

6.  The initiation codon for protein synthesis (nearly always 

an ATG) has a statistical association with adjacent 
nucleotides that seem to enhance its recognition by 
translation factors.

7.  The terminal exon will have a signal (most commonly 

AATAAA) for cleavage and polyadenylation close to its  
3ʹ end.

The statistical nature of these features, coupled with the low 
frequency of coding information in the genome (2–3%) and 
the frequency of alternative splicing (an estimated 95% of 
human genes), makes it especially impressive that current 
algorithms can identify more than 70% of individual exons in 
the human genome. As shown in Figure 9–37, bioinformatic 
approaches are usually coupled with direct experimental 
data, such as those obtained from RNA Seq.

Figure 4-34

Answer 4-26

It is not a simple matter to determine the 

Answer 9–13 
function of a gene from scratch, nor is there a universal 
recipe for doing so. Nevertheless, there are a variety of 
standard questions whose answers help to narrow down the 
possibilities. Below we list some of these questions.

In what tissues is the gene expressed? If the gene is 

expressed in all tissues, it is likely to have a general function. 
If it is expressed in one or a few tissues, its function is 
likely to be more specialized, perhaps related to the 
specialized functions of the tissues. If the gene is expressed 
in the embryo but not the adult, it probably functions in 
development.

In what compartment of the cell is the protein found? 

Knowing the subcellular localization of the protein—nucleus, 
plasma membrane, mitochondria, etc.—can also help to 

Answers

A:25

suggest categories of potential function. For example, a 
protein that is localized to the plasma membrane is likely 
to be a transporter, a receptor or other component of a 
signaling pathway, a cell-adhesion molecule, etc.

What are the effects of mutations in the gene? Mutations 

that eliminate or modify the function of the gene product 
can also provide clues to function. For example, if the gene 
product is critical at a certain time during development, 
mutant embryos will often die at that stage or develop 
obvious abnormalities. Unless the abnormality is highly 
specific, it is usually difficult to deduce its function. And 
often the links are indirect, becoming apparent only after 
the gene’s function is known.

With what other proteins does the encoded protein 
interact? In carrying out their function, proteins often 
interact with other proteins involved in the same or closely 
related processes. If an interacting protein can be identified, 
and if its function is already known (through previous 
research or through the searching of databases), the range 
of possible functions can be narrowed dramatically.

Can mutations in other genes alter effects of mutation in 

the unknown gene? Searching for such mutations can be 
a very powerful approach to investigating gene function, 
especially in organisms such as bacteria and yeast, which 
have simple genetic systems. Although much more 
difficult to perform in the mouse, this type of approach 
can nonetheless be used. The rationale for this strategy 
is analogous to that of looking for interacting proteins: 
genes that interact genetically—so that the double mutant 
phenotype is more selective than either of the individual 
mutants—are often involved in the same process or 
in closely related processes. Identification of such an 
interacting gene (and knowledge of its function) would 
provide an important clue to the function of the unknown 
gene.

Addressing each of these questions requires specialized 
experimental expertise and a substantial time commitment 
from the investigator. It is no wonder that progress is made 
much more rapidly when a clue to a gene’s function can be 
found simply by identifying a similar gene of known function 
in the database. As more and more genes are studied, this 
strategy will become increasingly successful.

In a very long, random sequence of 

Answer 9–14 
DNA, each of the 64 different codons will occur with equal 
frequency. Because 3 of the 64 are stop codons, they will be 
expected to occur on average every 21 codons  
(64/3 = 21.3).

Answer 9–15  On the surface, its resistance to mutation 
suggests that the genetic code was shaped by forces of 
natural selection. An underlying assumption, which seems 
reasonable, is that resistance to mutation is a valuable 
feature of a genetic code. This reasoning suggests that it 
would have been a lucky accident indeed—roughly a one-in-
a-million chance—to stumble on a code as error-proof as our 
own.

But all is not so simple. If resistance to mutation is an 
essential feature of any code that can support complex 
organisms such as ourselves, then the only codes we could 
observe are ones that are error-resistant. A less favorable 
frozen accident, giving rise to a more error-prone code, 
might have limited the complexity of life to organisms too 
simple to contemplate their own genetic code. This is akin 
to the anthropic principle of cosmology: many universes 

may be possible, but few are compatible with life that can 
ponder the nature of the universe.

Beyond these considerations, there is ample evidence 
that the code is not static, and thus could respond to the 
forces of natural selection. Altered versions of the standard 
genetic code have been identified in the mitochondrial and 
nuclear genomes of several organisms. In each case, one or 
a few codons have taken on a new meaning.

Answer 9–16  All of these mechanisms contribute to 
the evolution of new protein-coding genes. A, B, C, and 
E were discussed in the text. Recent studies indicate that 
certain short protein-coding genes arose from previously 
untranslated regions of genomes, so choice D is also 
correct.

Answer 9–17
A.  Because synonymous changes do not alter the amino 

acid sequence of the protein, they usually do not affect 
the overall fitness of the organism and are therefore not 
selected against. By contrast, nonsynonymous changes, 
which substitute a new amino acid in place of the original 
one, can alter the function of the encoded protein and 
change the fitness of the organism. Since most amino 
acid substitutions probably harm the protein, they tend 
to be selected against.

B.  Virtually all amino acid substitutions in the histone H3 

protein are deleterious and are therefore selected 
against. The extreme conservation of histone H3 argues 
that its function is very tightly constrained, probably 
because of extensive interactions with other proteins 
and with DNA.

C.  Histone H3 is clearly not in a “privileged” site in the 

genome because it undergoes synonymous nucleotide 
changes at about the same rate as other genes.

Answer 9–18
A.  The data embodied in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 
Q9–18) refutes the hypothesis that plant hemoglobin 
genes were acquired by horizontal transfer. Looking 
at the more familiar parts of the tree, we see that 
the hemoglobins of vertebrates (fish to human) have 
approximately the same phylogenetic relationships as 
do the species themselves. Plant hemoglobins also form 
a distinct group that displays accepted evolutionary 
relationships, with barley, a monocot, diverging before 
bean, alfalfa, and lotus, which are all dicots (and 
legumes). The basic hemoglobin gene, therefore, was 
in place long ago in evolution. The phylogenetic tree of 
Figure Q9–18 indicates that the hemoglobin genes in 
modern plant and animal species were inherited from a 
common ancestor.

B.  Had the plant hemoglobin genes arisen by 

horizontal transfer from a nematode, then the plant 
sequences would have clustered with the nematode 
sequences in the phylogenetic tree in Figure Q9–18.

In each human lineage, new mutations will 

Answer 9–19 
be introduced at a rate of 10–10 alterations per nucleotide 
per cell generation, and the differences between two human 
lineages will accumulate at twice this rate. To accumulate 
10–3 differences per nucleotide will thus take 10–3/
(2 × 10–10) cell generations, corresponding to (1/200) × 
10–3/(2 × 10–10) = 25,000 human generations, or 750,000 
years. In reality, we are not descended from one pair of 
genetically identical ancestral humans; rather, it is likely that 

A:26 

Answers

we are descended from a relatively small founder population 
of humans who were already genetically diverse. More 
sophisticated analysis suggests that this founder population 
existed about 150,000 years ago.

Answer 9–20  The AIDS virus (the human 
immunodeficiency virus, HIV) is a retrovirus, and thus 
synthesizes DNA from an RNA template using reverse 
transcriptase. This leads to frequent mutation of the viral 
genome. In fact, AIDS patients often carry many different 
genetic variants of HIV that are distinct from the original 
virus that infected them. This poses great problems in 
treating the infection: drugs that block essential viral 
enzymes work only temporarily, because new strains of the 
virus resistant to these drugs arise rapidly by mutation. 
   RNA replicases (enzymes that synthesize RNA using RNA 
as a template) do not proofread either. Thus, RNA viruses 
that replicate their RNA genomes directly (that is, without 
using DNA as an intermediate) also mutate frequently. In 
such a virus, this tends to produce changes in the coat 
proteins that cause the mutated virus to appear “new” to 
our immune systems; the virus is therefore not suppressed 
by immunity that has arisen to the previous version. This is 
part of the explanation for the new strains of the influenza 
(flu) virus and the common cold virus that regularly appear.

Chapter 10

Answer 10–1  The presence of a mutation in a gene 
does not necessarily mean that the protein expressed from 
it is defective. For example, the mutation could change 
one codon into another that still specifies the same amino 
acid, and so does not change the amino acid sequence of 
the protein. Or, the mutation may cause a change from one 
amino acid to another in the protein, but in a position that 
is not important for the folding or function of the protein. 
In assessing the likelihood that such a mutation might cause 
a defective protein, information on the known β-globin 
mutations that are found in humans is essential. You would 
therefore want to know the precise nucleotide change 
in your mutant gene, and whether this change has any 
known or predictable consequences for the function of the 
encoded protein. If your mate has two normal copies of the 
globin gene, 50% of your children would be carriers of your 
mutant gene.

3ʹ-TTCTTAACGCCTTAA   GCCC   GGAATTCGCGGCGCAGCTCC   GGAATTT-5ʹ
ANSWER 10–3  Protein biochemistry is still very important 
because it provides the link between the amino acid 
sequence (which can be deduced from DNA sequences) 
and the functional properties of the protein. We are still not 
able to infallibly predict the folding of a polypeptide chain 
from its amino acid sequence, and in most cases information 
regarding the function of the protein, such as its catalytic 

activity, cannot be deduced from the gene sequence alone. 
Instead, such information must be obtained experimentally 
by analyzing the properties of proteins biochemically. 
Furthermore, the structural information that can be deduced 
from DNA sequences is necessarily incomplete. We cannot, 
for example, accurately predict covalent modifications of 
the protein, proteolytic processing, the presence of tightly 
bound small molecules, or the association of the protein 
with other subunits. Moreover, we cannot accurately predict 
the effects these modifications might have on the activity of 
the protein.

Answer 10–4
A.  After an additional round of amplification there will be 2 
gray, 4 green, 4 red, and 22 yellow-outlined fragments; 
after a second additional round there will be 2 gray, 5 
green, 5 red, and 52 yellow-outlined fragments. Thus the 
DNA fragments outlined in yellow increase exponentially 
and will eventually overrun the other reaction products. 
Their length is determined by the DNA sequence that 
spans the distance between the two primers plus the 
length of the primers. 

B.  The mass of one DNA molecule 500 nucleotide pairs 

long is 5.5 × 10–19 g [= 2 × 500 × 330 (g/mole)/6 × 1023 
(molecules/mole)]. Ignoring the complexities of the first 
few steps of the amplification reaction (which produce 
longer products that eventually make an insignificant 
contribution to the total DNA amplified), this amount of 
product approximately doubles for every amplification 
step. Therefore, 100 × 10–9 g = 2N × 5.5 × 10–19 g, 
where N is the number of amplification steps of the 
reaction. Solving this equation for N = log(1.81 × 1011)/
log(2) gives N = 37.4. Thus, only about 40 cycles of 
PCR amplification are sufficient to amplify DNA from a 
single molecule to a quantity that can be readily handled 
and analyzed biochemically. This whole procedure is 
automated and takes only a few hours in the laboratory.

If the ratio of dideoxyribonucleoside 

Answer 10–5 
triphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
is increased, DNA polymerization will be terminated 
more frequently and thus shorter DNA strands will be 
produced. Such conditions are favorable for determining 
nucleotide sequences that are close to the DNA 
primer used in the reaction. In contrast, decreasing 
the ratio of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to 
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates will produce longer 
DNA fragments, thus allowing one to determine nucleotide 
sequences more distant from the primer.

Answer 10–6  Although several explanations are 
possible, the simplest is that the DNA probe has hybridized 
predominantly with its corresponding mRNA, which is 
typically present in many more copies per cell than is the 
gene. The different extents of hybridization probably reflect 
different levels of gene expression. Perhaps each of the 
different cell types that make up the tissue expresses the 
gene at a different level. 

Answer 10–7  Like the vast majority of mammalian genes, 
the attractase gene likely contains introns. Bacteria do not 
have the splicing machinery required to remove introns, 
and therefore the correct protein would not be expressed 
from the gene. For expression of most mammalian genes in 
bacterial cells, a cDNA version of the gene must be used.

Answer 10–8
A.  False. Restriction sites are found at random throughout 

the genome, within as well as between genes. 

B.  True. DNA bears a negative charge at each phosphate, 

giving DNA an overall negative charge. 

C.  False. Clones isolated from cDNA libraries do not 

contain promoter sequences. These sequences are not 
transcribed and are therefore not part of the mRNAs 
that are used as the templates to make cDNAs. 

D.  True. Each polymerization reaction produces double-

stranded DNA that must, at each cycle, be denatured to 
allow new primers to hybridize so that the DNA strand 
can be copied again. 

E.  False. Digestion of genomic DNA with restriction 

nucleases that recognize four-nucleotide sequences 
produces fragments that are on average 256 nucleotides 
long. However, the actual lengths of the fragments 
produced will vary considerably on both sides of the 
average. 

F.  True. Reverse transcriptase is first needed to copy the 

mRNA into single-stranded DNA, and DNA polymerase 
is then required to make the second DNA strand.

G.  True. Using a sufficient number of STRs, individuals can 

be uniquely “fingerprinted” (see Figure 10–18).

H.  True. If cells of the tissue do not transcribe the gene 

of interest, it will not be represented in a cDNA 
library prepared from this tissue. However, it will be 
represented in a genomic library prepared from the 
same tissue.

Answer 10–9
A.  The DNA sequence, from its 5ʹ end to its 3ʹ end, is read 
starting from the bottom of the gel, where the smallest 
DNA fragments migrate. Each band results from the 
incorporation of the appropriate dideoxyribonucleoside 
triphosphate, and as expected there are no two 
bands that have the same mobility. This allows one to 
determine the DNA sequence by reading off the bands 
in strict order, proceeding upward from the bottom of 
the gel, and assigning the correct nucleotide according 
to which lane the band is in. 
   The nucleotide sequence of the top strand (Figure 
A10–9A) was obtained directly from the data of Figure 
Q10–9, and the bottom strand was deduced from the 
complementary base-pairing rules.

B.  The DNA sequence can then be translated into an amino 

acid sequence using the genetic code. However, there 
are two strands of DNA that could be transcribed into 
RNA and three possible reading frames for each strand. 
Thus there are six amino acid sequences that can in 
principle be encoded by this stretch of DNA. Of the 
three reading frames possible from the top strand, only 
one is not interrupted by a stop codon (yellow blocks in 
Figure A10–9b).
   From the bottom strand, two of the three reading 
frames also have stop codons (not shown). The third 

Answers

A:27

 

frame gives the following sequence:  
SerAlaLeuGlySerSerGluAsnArgProArgThrProAlaArg 
ThrGlyCysProValTyr
   It is not possible from the information given to tell 
which of the two open reading frames corresponds to 
the actual protein encoded by this stretch of DNA. What 
additional experiment could distinguish between these 
two possibilities?

Answer 10–10
A.  Cleavage of human genomic DNA with HaeIII would 

generate about 11 × 106 different fragments 
[= 3 × 109/44] and with EcoRI about 730,000 different 
fragments [= 3 × 109/46]. There will also be some 
additional fragments generated because the maternal 
and paternal chromosomes are very similar but not 
identical in DNA sequence. 

B.  A set of overlapping DNA fragments will be generated. 

Libraries constructed from sets of overlapping fragments 
are valuable because they can be used to order cloned 
sequences in relation to their original order in the 
genome and thus obtain the DNA sequence of a long 
stretch of DNA (see Figure 10–26).

Answer 10–11 By comparison with the positions of 
the size markers, we find that EcoRI treatment gives two 
fragments of 4 kb and 6 kb; HindIII treatment gives one 
fragment of 10 kb; and treatment with EcoRI + HindIII gives 
three fragments of 6 kb, 3 kb, and 1 kb. This gives a total 
length of 10 kb calculated as the sum of the fragments  
in each lane. Thus the original DNA molecule must be  
10 kb (10,000 nucleotide pairs) long. Because treatment 
with HindIII gives a fragment 10 kb long it could be that 
the original DNA is a linear molecule with no cutting site for 
HindIII. But we can rule that out by the results of the EcoRI 
+ HindIII digestion. We know that EcoRI cleavage alone 
produces two fragments of 6 kb and 4 kb, and in the double 
digest this 4-kb fragment is further cleaved by HindIII into 
a 3-kb and a 1-kb fragment. The DNA therefore contains a 
single HindIII cleavage site, and thus it must be circular, as 
a single fragment of 10 kb is produced when it is cut with 
HindIII alone. Arranging the cutting sites on a circular DNA 
to give the appropriate sizes of fragments produces the 
map illustrated in Figure A10–11.

Answers

Answer 10–12
A.  The genetic code is degenerate, and there is more 

than one possible codon for each amino acid, with the 
exception of tryptophan and methionine. Therefore, to 
detect the nucleotide sequence that codes for the amino 
acid sequence of the protein, many DNA molecules must 
be made and pooled to ensure that the mixture will 
contain the one that exactly matches the DNA sequence 
of the gene. For the three peptide sequences given in 
this question, the following probes need to be made 
(alternative bases at the same position are given in 
parentheses):

  Peptide 1:  
 

5ʹ-TGGATGCA(C,T)CA(C,T)AA(A,G)-3ʹ
Because of the three twofold degeneracies, you would 
need eight (= 23) different DNA sequences in the 
mixture.

  Peptide 2: 

 

 

5ʹ(T,C)T(G,A,T,C)(A,T)(G,C)(G,A,T,C)(A,C)
G(G,A,T,C)(T,C)T(G,A,T,C)(A,C)G(G,A,T,C)-3ʹ
The mixture representing peptide sequence #2 is much 
more complicated. Leu, Ser, and Arg are each encoded 
by six different codons; you would therefore need 
to synthesize a mixture of 7776 (= 65) different DNA 
molecules. 

  Peptide 3:  
 

5ʹ-TA(C,T)TT(C,T)GG(G,A,T,C)ATGCA(A,G)3ʹ
Because of three twofold and one fourfold degeneracies, 
you would need 32 (= 23 × 4) different sequences in the 
mixture.
   You would probably first use probe #1 to screen your 
library by hybridization. Because there are only eight 
possible DNA sequences, the ratio of the one correct 
sequence to the incorrect ones is highest, giving you 
the best chance of finding a matching clone. Probe #2 
is practically useless, because only 1/7776 of the DNA 
in the mixture would perfectly hybridize to your gene of 
interest. You could use probe #3 to verify that the clone 
you obtained is correct. Any library clones that hybridize 
to probes #1 and #3 are very likely to contain the gene 
of interest. 

B.  Knowing that peptide sequence #3 contains the last 

amino acid of the protein is valuable information because 
it tells you that the other two peptide sequences must 
precede it, that is, they must be located farther toward 
the N-terminal end of the protein. Knowing this order is 
important, because DNA primers can be extended by 
DNA polymerases only from their 3ʹ ends; thus, the 3ʹ 
ends of two primers need to “face” each other during 
a PCR amplification reaction (see Figure 10–14). A PCR 
primer based on peptide sequence #3 must therefore be 
the complementary sequence of probe #3 (so that its 3ʹ 
end corresponds to the first nucleotide of the sequence 
complementary to the Trp codon): 

  5ʹ-(TC)TGCAT(G,A,T,C)CC(G,A)AA(G,A)TA-3ʹ
 

   As before, this “primer” would contain 32 different 
DNA sequences, only one of which will perfectly match 
the gene. Probe #1 could be your choice for the second 
primer. Probe #2, again because of its high degeneracy, 
would be a much less suitable choice.

C.  The ends of the final amplification product are derived 
from the primers, which are each 15 nucleotides long. 
Therefore, a 270-nucleotide segment of the cDNA 
of the gene has been amplified. This will encode 90 

amino acids; adding the amino acids encoded by the 
primers gives you a protein-coding sequence of 100 
amino acids. This is unlikely to represent the whole 
gene. To your satisfaction, however, you note that 
CTATCACGCTTAGG encodes peptide sequence #2. This 
information therefore confirms that your PCR product 
indeed encodes a fragment of the protein you originally 
isolated.

Answer 10–13 The products will comprise a large number 
of different single-stranded DNA molecules, one for each 
nucleotide in the sequence. However, each DNA molecule 
will be one of four colors, depending on which of the four 
dideoxyribonucleotides terminated the polymerization 
reaction of that chain. Separation by gel electrophoresis will 
generate a ladder of bands, each one nucleotide apart, and 
the sequence can be read from the order of colors (Figure 
A10–13). The method described here forms the basis for 
the DNA sequencing strategy used in most automated DNA 
sequencing machines (see Figure 10–21).

Answer 10–14
A.  cDNA clones could not be used because there is no 
overlap between cDNA clones from adjacent genes. 

B.  Such repetitive DNA sequences can confuse 

chromosome walks, because the walk would appear 
to branch off in many different directions at once. The 
general strategy for avoiding these problems is to use 
genomic clones that are sufficiently long to span beyond 
the repetitive DNA sequences.

ECB2 A10.15

Answer 10–15
A.  Infants 2 and 8 have identical STR patterns and therefore 

must be identical twins. Infants 3 and 6 also have 
identical STR patterns and must also be identical twins. 
The other two sets of twins must be fraternal twins 
because their STR patterns are not identical. Fraternal 
twins, like any pair of siblings born to the same parents, 
will have roughly half their genome in common. Thus, 
roughly half the STR polymorphisms in fraternal twins 
will be identical. Using this criterion, you can identify 
infants 1 and 7 as fraternal twins and infants 4 and 5 as 
fraternal twins.

B.  You can match infants to their parents by using the 
same sort of analysis of STR polymorphisms. Every 
band present in the analysis of an infant should have 
a matching band in one or the other of the parents, 
and, on average, each infant will share half of its 

polymorphisms with each parent. Thus, the degree 
of match between each child and each parent will be 
approximately the same as that between fraternal twins.

Answer 10–16 Mutant bacteria that do not produce 
ice-protein have probably arisen many times in nature. 
However, bacteria that produce ice-protein have a slight 
growth advantage over bacteria that do not, so it would be 
difficult to find such mutants in the wild. Recombinant DNA 
technology makes these mutants much easier to obtain. 
In this case, the consequences, both advantageous and 
disadvantageous, of using a genetically modified organism 
are therefore nearly indistinguishable from those of a 
natural mutant. Indeed, bacterial and yeast strains have 
been selected for centuries for desirable genetic traits 
that make them suitable for industrial-scale applications 
such as cheese and wine production. The possibilities of 
recombinant DNA technology are endless, however, and 
as with any technology, there is a finite risk of unforeseen 
consequences. Recombinant DNA experimentation, 
therefore, is regulated, and the risks of individual projects 
are carefully assessed by review panels before permissions 
are granted. The state of our knowledge is sufficiently 
advanced that the consequences of some changes, such as 
the disruption of a bacterial gene in the example above, can 
be predicted with reasonable certainty. Other applications, 
such as germ-line gene therapy to correct human disease, 
may have far more complex outcomes, and it will take many 
more years of research and ethical debate to determine 
whether such treatments will eventually be used.

Answer 11–1  Water is a liquid, and thus hydrogen bonds 
between water molecules are not static; they are continually 
formed and broken again by thermal motion. When a water 
molecule happens to be next to a hydrophobic molecule, it 
is more restricted in motion and has fewer neighbors with 
which it can interact because it cannot form any hydrogen 
bonds in the direction of the hydrophobic molecule. It 
will therefore form hydrogen bonds to the more limited 
number of water molecules in its proximity. Bonding to 
fewer partners results in a more ordered water structure, 
which represents the cagelike structure in Figure 11–9. 
This structure has been likened to ice, although it is a 
more transient, less organized, and less extensive network 
than even a tiny ice crystal. The formation of any ordered 
structure decreases the entropy of the system and is thus 
energetically unfavorable (discussed in Chapter 3).

(B) is the correct analogy for lipid bilayer 

Answer 11–2 
assembly because exclusion from water rather than 
attractive forces between the lipid molecules is involved. 
If the lipid molecules formed bonds with one another, the 
bilayer would be less fluid, and might even become rigid, 
depending on the strength of the interaction.

Answer 11–3  The fluidity of the bilayer is strictly 
confined to one plane: lipid molecules can diffuse laterally 
in their own monolayer but do not readily flip from one 
monolayer to the other. Specific types of lipid molecules 
inserted into one monolayer therefore remain in it unless 
they are actively transferred by an enzyme—called a 
flippase.

Internal hydrogen bonds between the peptide bonds

and therefore hydrophilic. The OH group and the C–O–C

bonds with water molecules and are therefore hydrophilic. 
In contrast, the blue portions of the detergents are either 
hydrocarbon chains or aromatic rings, neither of which has 
polar groups that could form hydrogen bonds with water 
molecules; they are therefore hydrophobic. (See Figure

Answer 11–6  Some of the molecules of the two different 
transmembrane proteins are anchored to the spectrin 
filaments of the cell cortex. These molecules are not free to 
rotate or diffuse within the plane of the membrane. There 
is an excess of transmembrane proteins over the available 
attachment sites in the cortex, however, so that some of 
the transmembrane protein molecules are not anchored 
and are free to rotate and diffuse within the plane of the 
membrane. Indeed, measurements of protein mobility show 
that there are two populations of each transmembrane 
protein, corresponding to those proteins that are anchored 
and those that are not.

ECB2 EA11.05

Answer 11–7  The different ways in which membrane 
proteins can be restricted to different regions of the 
membrane are summarized in Figure 11–31. The mobility 
of the membrane proteins is drastically reduced if they are 
bound to other proteins such as those of the cell cortex 
or the extracellular matrix. Some membrane proteins are 
confined to membrane domains by barriers, such as tight 
junctions. The fluidity of the lipid bilayer is not significantly 
affected by the anchoring of membrane proteins; the sea of 
lipid molecules flows around anchored membrane proteins 
like water around the posts of a pier.

Answer 11–8  All of the statements are correct.
A, B, C, D. The lipid bilayer is fluid because its lipid

Some special glycolipids, such as phosphatidylinositol

G.  Examples include the many membrane enzymes involved

H.  Polysaccharides are the main constituents of mucus and

Answer 11–9 
are free to move only in one plane; the molecules in a 
normal fluid, in contrast, can move in three dimensions.

In a two-dimensional fluid, the molecules 

Answer 11–10
A.  You would have a detergent. The diameter of the lipid 

head would be much larger than that of the hydrocarbon 
tail, so that the shape of the molecule would be a 
cone rather than a cylinder, and the molecules would 
aggregate to form micelles rather than bilayers.

B.  Lipid bilayers formed would be much more fluid, as 

the tails would have less tendency to interact with one 
another. The bilayers would also be less stable, as the 
shorter hydrocarbon tails would be less hydrophobic, so 
the forces that drive the formation of the bilayer would 
be reduced.

C.  The lipid bilayers formed would be much less fluid. 

Whereas a normal lipid bilayer has the viscosity of olive 
oil, a bilayer made of the same lipids but with saturated 
hydrocarbon tails would have the consistency of bacon 
fat.

D.  The lipid bilayers formed would be much more fluid. 

Also, because the lipids would pack together less well, 
there would be more gaps and the bilayer would be 
more permeable to small, water-soluble molecules.

E.  If we assume that the lipid molecules are completely 

intermixed, the fluidity of the membrane would be 
unchanged. In such bilayers, however, the saturated lipid 
molecules would tend to aggregate with one another 
because they can pack so much more tightly and would 
therefore form patches of much-reduced fluidity. The 
bilayer would not, therefore, have uniform properties 
over its surface. Because, normally, one saturated and 
one unsaturated hydrocarbon tail are linked to the same 
hydrophilic head in membrane phospholipid molecules, 
such segregation does not occur in cell membranes.

F.  The lipid bilayers formed would have virtually unchanged 

properties. Each lipid molecule would now span the 
entire membrane, with one of its two head groups 
exposed at each surface. Such lipid molecules are found 
in the membranes of thermophilic bacteria, which can 
live at temperatures approaching boiling water. Their 
bilayers do not come apart at elevated temperatures, as 
usual bilayers do, because the original two monolayers 
are now covalently linked into a single structure.

Answer 11–11 Phospholipid molecules are approximately 
cylindrical in shape. Detergent molecules, by contrast, 
are conical or wedge-shaped. A phospholipid molecule 
with only one hydrocarbon tail, for example, would be 
a detergent. To make a phospholipid molecule into a 
detergent, you would have to make its hydrophilic head 
larger or remove one of its tails so that it could form a 
micelle. Detergent molecules also usually have shorter 
hydrocarbon tails than phospholipid molecules. This makes 

them slightly water-soluble, so that detergent molecules 
leave and re-enter micelles frequently in aqueous solution. 
Because of this, some monomeric detergent molecules are 
always present in aqueous solution and therefore can enter 
the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane to solubilize the proteins 
(see Figure 11–26).

Answer 11–12 
A.  There are about 4000 lipid molecules, each 0.5 nm wide, 

between one end of the bacterial cell and the other.  
So if a lipid molecule at one end moved directly in a 
straight line it would require only 4 × 10–4 sec 
(= 4000 × 10–7) to reach the other end. In reality, 
however, the lipid molecule would move in a random 
path so that it would take considerably longer. We 
can calculate the approximate time required from the 
equation: t = x2/2D where x is the average distance 
moved, t is the time taken, and D is a constant called the 
diffusion coefficient. Inserting step values x = 0.5 nm and 
t = 10–7 sec we obtain D = 1.25 × 10–7 cm2/sec. Using 
this value in the same equation but with distance  
x = 2 × 10–4 cm (= 2 μm) gives the time taken 
t = 1.6 seconds.

B.  Similarly, if a 4-cm ping-pong ball exchanged partners 

every 10–7 seconds and moved in a linear fashion it 
would reach the opposite wall in 1.5 × 10–5 sec (traveling 
at 1,440,000 km/hr. But a random walk would take 
longer. Using the equation above, we calculate the 
constant D in this case to be 8 × 107 cm2/sec and the 
time required to travel 6 m about 2 msec (= 6002/(1.6 × 
108)).

Answer 11–13 Transmembrane proteins anchor

Answer 11–14 The hydrophilic faces of the five 
membrane-spanning α helices, each contributed by

can pass through this hydrophilic pore without coming 
into contact with the hydrophobic lipid tails of the bilayer. 
The hydrophobic side chains on the opposite face of the α 
helices interact with the hydrophobic lipid tails.

Answer 11–16 Membrane fusion does not alter the 
orientation of the membrane proteins with their attached

is exposed to the cytosol always remains exposed to the 
cytosol, and the portion exposed to the outside always 
remains exposed to the outside despite diffusional mixing 
(Figure A11–16). At 0ºC, the fluidity of the membrane

significantly slowed.

Answer 11–17 The exposure of hydrophobic amino acid 
side chains to water is energetically unfavorable. There are 
two ways that such side chains can be sequestered away 
from water to achieve an energetically more favorable 
state. First, they can form transmembrane segments that 
span a lipid bilayer. This requires about 20 of them to be 
located sequentially in the polypeptide chain. Second, the 
hydrophobic amino acid side chains can be sequestered 
in the interior of the folded polypeptide chain. This is one 
of the major forces that lock the polypeptide chain into 
a unique three-dimensional structure. In either case, the 
hydrophobic forces in the lipid bilayer or in the interior of a 
protein are based on the same principles.

C contains many charged amino acids (K, R, H, E, D), which 
would be energetically disfavored in the hydrophobic 
interior of the lipid bilayer.

Answer 12–1
A.  The movement of a solute mediated by a transporter 

can be described by a strictly analogous equation:

equation 1: T + S ↔ TS → T + S*

  where S is the solute, S* is the solute on the other 

side of the membrane (i.e., although it is still the same 
molecule, it is now located in a different environment), 
and T is the transporter. 

B.  This equation is useful because it describes a binding 

step, followed by a delivery step. The mathematical 
treatment of this equation would be very similar to 
that described for enzymes (see Figure 3–24); thus 

Answers

A:31

transporters are characterized by a KM value that 
describes their affinity for a solute and a Vmax value that 
describes their maximal rate of transfer. 
   To be more accurate, one could include the 
conformational change of the transporter in the reaction 
scheme: 

 

equation 2: T + S ↔ TS ↔ T*S* → T* + S*
equation 3: T ↔ T*

  where T* is the transporter after the conformational 

change that exposes its solute-binding site on the other 
side of the membrane. This account requires a second 
equation (3) that allows the transporter to return to its 
starting conformation.

C.  The equations do not describe the behavior of channels 
because solutes passing through channels do not bind to 
them in the way that a substrate binds to an enzyme.
If the Na+ pump is not working at full 
Answer 12–2 
capacity because it is partially inhibited by ouabain or 
digitalis, the electrochemical gradient of Na+ that the 
pump generates is less steep than that in untreated cells. 
Consequently, the Ca2+-Na+ antiport works less efficiently, 
and Ca2+ is removed from the cell more slowly. When 
the next cycle of muscle contraction begins, there is still 
an elevated level of Ca2+ left in the cytosol. The entry 
of the same number of Ca2+ ions into the cell therefore 
leads to a higher Ca2+ concentration than in untreated 
cells, which in turn leads to a stronger and longer-lasting 
muscle contraction. Because the Na+ pump fulfills essential 
functions in all animal cells, both to maintain osmotic 
balance and to generate the Na+ gradient used to power 
many transporters, the drugs are deadly poisons if too much 
is taken. 

Answer 12–3
A.  The properties define a transporter acting as a symport. 
B.  No additional properties need to be specified. The 

important feature that provides the coupling of the two 
solutes is that the protein cannot switch its conformation 
if only one of the two solutes is bound. Solute B, which 
is driving the transport of solute A, is in excess on the 
side of the membrane from which transport initiates and 
therefore occupies its binding site most of the time. In 
this state, the transporter is prevented from switching 
its conformation until a solute A molecule binds, which 
it will occasionally. With both binding sites occupied, the 
transporter switches conformation. Now exposed to the 
other side of the membrane, the binding site for solute B 
is mostly empty because there is little of it in the solution 
on this side of the membrane. Although the binding site 
for A is now more frequently occupied, the transporter 
can switch back only after solute A is unloaded as well. 

C.  An antiport could be similarly constructed with a 

transmembrane protein with the following properties. 
It has two binding sites, one for solute A and one for 
solute B. The protein can undergo a conformational 
change to switch between two states: either both 
binding sites are exposed exclusively on one side of 
the membrane or both are exposed exclusively on 
the other side. The protein can switch between the 
two conformational states only if one binding site 
is occupied, but not if both binding sites are either 
occupied or empty. 
   Note that these rules described in B and C provide 
an alternative model to that shown in Figure 12–14.

Answers

Thus, in principle, there are two possible ways to couple 
the transport of two solutes: (1) provide cooperative 
solute-binding sites and allow the transporter to switch 
between the two states randomly as shown in Figure 
12–14 or (2) allow independent binding of both solutes 
and make the switch between the two states conditional 
on the occupancy of the binding sites. As the structure 
of a coupled transporter has not yet been determined, 
we do not know which of the two mechanisms such 
transporters use.

Answer 12–4 
A.  Each of the rectangular peaks corresponds to the 

opening of a single channel that allows a small current 
to pass. You note from the recording that the channels 
present in the patch of membrane open and close 
frequently. Each channel remains open for a very 
short, somewhat variable time, averaging about 10 
milliseconds. When open, the channels allow a small 
current with a unique amplitude (4 pA; one picoampere 
= 10–12 A) to pass. In one instance, the current doubles, 
indicating that two channels in the same membrane 
patch opened simultaneously. 

B.  If acetylcholine is omitted or is added to the solution 

outside the pipette, you would measure only the 
baseline current. Acetylcholine must bind to the 
extracellular portion of the acetylcholine receptor in the 
membrane patch to allow the channel to open frequently 
enough to detect; in the membrane patch shown in 
Figure 12–24, only, the cytoplasmic side of the receptor 
is exposed to the solution outside the microelectrode.

Answer 12–5  The equilibrium potential of K+ is –90 mV 
[= 62 mV log10 (5 mM/140 mM)], and that of Na+ is 
+72 mV [= 62 mV log10 (145 mM/10 mM)]. The K+ leak 
channels are the main ion channels open in the plasma 
membrane of a resting cell, and they allow K+ to come to 
equilibrium; the membrane potential of the cell is therefore 
close to –90 mV. When Na+ channels open, Na+ rushes in, 
and, as a result, the membrane potential reverses its polarity 
to a value nearer to +72 mV, the equilibrium value for Na+. 
Upon closure of the Na+ channels, the K+ leak channels 
allow K+, now no longer at equilibrium, to exit from the cell 
until the membrane potential is restored to the equilibrium 
value for K+, about –90 mV.
Answer 12–6  When the resting membrane potential of 
an axon (inside negative) rises to a threshold value, voltage-
gated Na+ channels in the immediate neighborhood open 
and allow an influx of Na+. This depolarizes the membrane 
further, causing more voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, 
including those in the adjacent plasma membrane. This 
creates a wave of depolarization that spreads rapidly along 

the axon, called the action potential. Because Na+ channels 
become inactivated soon after they open, the outward 
flow of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels and K+ 
leak channels is rapidly able to restore the original resting 
membrane potential. (96 words)

If the number of functional acetylcholine 

Answer 12–7 
receptors is reduced by the antibodies, the neurotransmitter 
(acetylcholine) that is released from the nerve terminals 
cannot (or can only weakly) stimulate the muscle to contract. 

Answer 12–8  Although the concentration of Cl– outside 
cells is much higher than inside, when transmitter-gated Cl– 
channels open in the plasma membrane of a postsynaptic 
neuron in response to an inhibitory neurotransmitter, very 
little Cl– enters the cell. This is because the driving force 
for the influx of Cl– across the membrane is close to zero at 
the resting membrane potential, which opposes the influx. 
If, however, the excitatory neurotransmitter opens Na+ 
channels in the postsynaptic membrane at the same time 
that an inhibitory neurotransmitter opens Cl– channels, the 
resulting depolarization caused by the Na+ influx will cause 
Cl– to move into the cell through the open Cl– channels, 
neutralizing the effect of the Na+ influx. In this way, 
inhibitory neurotransmitters suppress the production of an 
action potential by making the target cell membrane much 
harder to depolarize.
Answer 12–9  By analogy to the Na+ pump shown 
in Figure 12–9, ATP might be hydrolyzed and donate 
a phosphate group to the transporter when—and only 
when—it has the solute bound on the cytosolic face of the 
membrane (step 1 → 2). The attachment of the phosphate 
would trigger an immediate conformational change 
(step 2 → 3), thereby capturing the solute and exposing 
it to the other side of the membrane. The phosphate 
would be removed from the protein when—and only 
when—the solute had dissociated, and the now empty, 
nonphosphorylated transporter would switch back to the 
starting conformation (step 3 → 4) (Figure A12–9).
Answer 12–10
A.  False. The plasma membrane contains transport proteins 

that confer selective permeability to many but not all 
charged molecules. In contrast, a pure lipid bilayer 
lacking proteins is highly impermeable to all charged 
molecules.

B.  False. Channels do not have binding pockets for the 

solute that passes through them. Selectivity of a channel 
is achieved by the size of the internal pore and by 
charged regions at the entrance of the pore that attract 
or repel ions of the appropriate charge. 

C.  False. Transporters are slower. They have enzymelike 

properties, i.e., they bind solutes and need to undergo

conformational changes during their functional cycle. 
This limits the maximal rate of transport to about 1000 
solute molecules per second, whereas channels can pass 
up to 1,000,000 solute molecules per second. 

D.  True. The bacteriorhodopsin of some photosynthetic 

bacteria pumps H+ out of the cell, using energy captured 
from visible light.

E.  True. Most animal cells contain K+ leak channels in their 

plasma membrane that are predominantly open. The 
K+ concentration inside the cell still remains higher than 
outside, because the membrane potential is negative 
and therefore inhibits the positively charged K+ from 
leaking out. K+ is also continually pumped into the cell 
by the Na+ pump.

F.  False. A symport binds two different solutes on the 

same side of the membrane. Turning it around would 
not change it into an antiport, which must also bind 
to different solutes, but on opposing sides of the 
membrane.

G.  False. The peak of an action potential corresponds 

to a transient shift of the membrane potential from a 
negative to a positive value. The influx of Na+ causes the 
membrane potential first to move toward zero and then 
to reverse, rendering the cell positively charged on its 
inside. Eventually, the resting potential is restored by an 
efflux of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels and K+ 
leak channels.

Answer 12–11 The permeabilities are N2 (small and 
nonpolar) > ethanol (small and slightly polar) > water (small 
and polar) > glucose (large and polar) > Ca2+ (small and 
charged) > RNA (very large and charged).

Answer 12–12
A.  Both couple the movement of two different solutes 

across a cell membrane. Symports transport both solutes 
in the same direction, whereas antiports transport the 
solutes in opposite directions.

B.  Both are mediated by membrane transport proteins. 
Passive transport of a solute occurs downhill, in the 
direction of its concentration or electrochemical 
gradient, whereas active transport occurs uphill and 
therefore needs an energy source. Active transport 
can be mediated by transporters but not by channels, 
whereas passive transport can be mediated by either.

C.  Both terms describe gradients across a membrane. The 
membrane potential refers to the voltage gradient; the 
electrochemical gradient is a composite of the voltage 
gradient and the concentration gradient of a specific 
charged solute (ion). The membrane potential is defined 
independently of the solute of interest, whereas an 
electrochemical gradient refers to the particular solute.

D.  A pump is a specialized transporter that uses energy 

to transport a solute uphill—against an electrochemical 
gradient for a charged solute or a concentration for an 
uncharged solute.

E.  Both transmit electrical signals by means of electrons in 
wires and ion movements across the plasma membrane 
in axons. Wires are made of copper, axons are not. 
The signal passing down an axon does not diminish in 
strength, because it is self-amplifying, whereas the signal 
in a wire decreases over distance (by leakage of current 
across the insulating sheath).

F.  Both affect the osmotic pressure in a cell. An ion is a 

solute that bears a charge.

Answer 12–13 A bridge allows vehicles to pass over 
water in a steady stream; the entrance can be designed 
to exclude, for example, oversized trucks, and it can be 
intermittently closed to traffic by a gate. By analogy, 
gated channels allow ions to pass across a cell membrane, 
imposing size and charge restrictions. 
   A ferry, in contrast, loads vehicles on one side of the 
body of water, crosses, and unloads on the other side—a 
slower process. During loading, particular vehicles could be 
selected from the waiting line because they fit particularly 
well on the car deck. By analogy, transporters bind 
solutes on one side of the membrane and then, after a 
conformational movement, release them on the other side. 
Specific binding selects the molecules to be transported. 
As in the case of coupled transport, sometimes you have to 
wait until the ferry is full before you can go.

Answer 12–14 Acetylcholine is being transported 
into the vesicles by an H+–acetylcholine antiport in the 
vesicle membrane. The H+ gradient that drives the uptake 
is generated by an ATP-driven H+ pump in the vesicle 
membrane, which pumps H+ into the vesicle (hence the 
dependence of the reaction on ATP). Raising the pH of 
the solution surrounding the vesicles decreases the H+ 
concentration of the solution, thereby increasing the 
outward gradient across the vesicle membrane, explaining 
the enhanced rate of acetylcholine uptake.

Answer 12–15 The voltage gradient across the membrane 
is about 150,000 V/cm (70 × 10–3 V/4.5 × 10–7 cm). This 
extremely powerful electric field is close to the limit at 
which insulating materials—such as the lipid bilayer—
break down and cease to act as insulators. The large field 
indicates what a large amount of energy can be stored in 
electrical gradients across the membrane, as well as the 
extreme electrical forces that proteins can experience 
in a membrane. A voltage of 150,000 V would instantly 
discharge in an arc across a 1-cm-wide gap (that is, air would 
be an insufficient insulator for this strength of field). 

Answer 12–16
A.  Nothing. You require ATP to drive the Na+ pump.
B.  The ATP becomes hydrolyzed, and Na+ is pumped into 

the vesicles, generating a concentration gradient of Na+ 
across the membrane. At the same time, K+ is pumped 
out of the vesicles, generating a concentration gradient 
of K+ of opposite polarity. When all the K+ is pumped 
out of the vesicle or the ATP runs out, the pump would 
stop.

C.  The pump would initiate a transport cycle and then 
cease. Because all reaction steps must occur strictly 
sequentially, dephosphorylation and the accompanying 
conformational switch cannot occur in the absence 
of K+. The Na+ pump will therefore become stuck in 
the phosphorylated state, waiting indefinitely for a 
potassium ion. The number of sodium ions transported 
would be minuscule, because each pump molecule 
would have functioned only a single time.  
   Similar experiments, leaving out individual ions and 
analyzing the consequences, were used to determine the 
sequence of steps by which the Na+ pump works.

D.  ATP would become hydrolyzed, and Na+ and K+ would 

be pumped across the membrane as described in (B). 
However, the pump molecules that sit in the membrane 
in the reverse orientation would be completely inactive 

A:34 

Answers

(i.e., they would not—as one might have erroneously 
assumed—pump ions in the opposite direction), 
because ATP would not have access to the site on 
these molecules where phosphorylation occurs, which is 
normally exposed to the cytosol. ATP is highly charged 
and cannot cross membranes without the help of specific 
transporters. 

E.  ATP becomes hydrolyzed, and Na+ and K+ are pumped 
across the membrane, as described in (B). K+, however, 
immediately flows back into the vesicles through the 
K+ leak channels. K+ moves down the K+ concentration 
gradient formed by the action of the Na+ pump. 
With each K+ that moves into the vesicle through a 
leak channel, a positive charge is moved across the 
membrane, generating a membrane potential that is 
positive on the inside of the vesicles. Eventually, K+ 
will stop flowing through the leak channels when the 
membrane potential balances the K+ concentration 
gradient. The scenario described here is a slight 
oversimplification: the Na+ pump in mammalian 
cells actually moves three sodium ions out of cells 
for each two potassium ions that it pumps, thereby 
driving an electric current across the membrane and 
making a small additional contribution to the resting 
membrane potential (which therefore corresponds only 
approximately to a state of equilibrium for K+ moving via 
K+ leak channels).

Answer 12–17 Ion channels can be ligand-gated, voltage-
gated, or mechanically (stress) gated. 

Answer 12–18 The cell has a volume of 10–12 liters 
(= 10–15 m3) and thus contains 6 × 104 calcium ions 
(= 6 × 1023 molecules/mole × 100 × 10–9 moles/liter × 
10–12 liters). Therefore, to raise the intracellular Ca2+ 
concentration fiftyfold, another 2,940,000 calcium ions have 
to enter the cell (note that at 5 μM concentration there are 
3 × 106 ions in the cell, of which 60,000 are already present 
before the channels are opened). Because each of the 1000 
channels allows 106 ions to pass per second, each channel 
has to stay open for only 3 milliseconds. 

Answer 12–19 Animal cells drive most transport 
processes across the plasma membrane with the 
electrochemical gradient of Na+. ATP is needed to fuel the 
Na+ pump to maintain the Na+ gradient.

Answer 12–20
A.  If H+ is pumped across the membrane into the 

endosomes, an electrochemical gradient of H+ results—
composed of both an H+ concentration gradient and 
a membrane potential, with the interior of the vesicle 
positive. Both of these components add to the energy 
that is stored in the gradient and that must be supplied 
to generate it. The electrochemical gradient will limit 
the transfer of more H+. If, however, the membrane also 
contains Cl– channels, the negatively charged Cl– in the 
cytosol will flow into the endosomes and diminish their 
membrane potential. It therefore becomes energetically 
less expensive to pump more H+ across the membrane, 
and the interior of the endosomes can become more 
acidic. 

B.  No. As explained in (A), some acidification would still 

occur in their absence.

Answer 12–21
A.  See Figure A12–21A. 
B.  The transport rates of compound A are proportional 
to its concentration, indicating that compound A can 
diffuse through membranes on its own. Compound A is 
likely to be ethanol, because it is a small and relatively 
nonpolar molecule that can diffuse readily through the 
lipid bilayer (see Figure 12–2).  
   In contrast, the transport rates of compound B 
saturate at high concentrations, indicating that 
compound B is transported across the membrane by 
some sort of membrane transport protein. Transport 
rates cannot increase beyond a maximal rate at which 
this protein can function. Compound B is likely to be 
acetate, because it is a charged molecule that could not 
cross the membrane without the help of a membrane 
transport protein. 

C.  For ethanol, the graph shows a linear relationship 

between concentration and transport rate. Thus, at  
0.5 mM the transport rate would be 10 μmol/min, and at 
100 mM the transport rate would be 2000 μmol/min 
(2 mmol/min).
   For the transport-protein-mediated movement of 
acetate, the relationship between concentration, S, 
and transport rate can be described by the Michaelis–
Menten equation, which describes simple enzyme

equation 1: transport rate = Vmax × S/[KM + S]

 

Recall from Chapter 3 (see Question 3–20, p. 118) that 
to determine the Vmax and KM, a trick is used in which 
the Michaelis–Menten equation is transformed so that 
it is possible to plot the data as a straight line. A simple 
transformation yields

equation 2: 1/rate = (KM/Vmax) (1/s) + 1/Vmax
(i.e., an equation of the form y = ax + b)

  Calculation of 1/rate and 1/S for the given data and 
plotting them in a new graph as in Figure A12–21b 
gives a straight line. The KM (= 1.0 mM) and Vmax 
(= 200 μmol/min) are determined from the intercept of 
the line with the y axis (1/Vmax) and from its slope (KM/
Vmax). Knowing the values for KM and Vmax allows you 
to calculate the transport rates for 0.5 mM and 100 mM 
acetate using equation (1). The results are 67 μmol/min 
and 198 μmol/min, respectively.

Answer 12–22 The membrane potential and the steep 
extracellular Na+ concentration provide a large inward 
electrochemical driving force and a large reservoir of Na+ 
ions, so that mostly Na+ ions enter the cell as acetylcholine 
receptors open. Ca2+ ions will also enter the cell, but 
their influx is much more limited because of their lower 
extracellular concentration. (Most of the Ca2+ that enters 
the cytosol to stimulate muscle contraction is released from 
intracellular stores, as we discuss in Chapter 17). Because 
of the high intracellular K+ concentration and the opposing 
direction of the membrane potential, there will be little if 
any movement of K+ ions upon opening of a cation channel.
Answer 12–23 The diversity of neurotransmitter-gated 
ion channels is a good thing for the industry, as it raises 
the possibility of developing new drugs specific for each 
channel type. Each of the diverse subtypes of these 
channels is expressed in a narrow subset of neurons. This 
narrow range of expression should make it possible, in 
principle, to discover or design drugs that affect particular 
receptor subtypes present in a selected set of neurons, thus 
to target particular brain functions with greater specificity.

Answer 13–1  To keep glycolysis going, cells need 
to regenerate NAD+ from NADH. There is no efficient 
way to do this without fermentation. In the absence of 
regenerated NAD+, step 6 of glycolysis (the oxidation of 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate 
(Panel 13–1, pp. 428–429) could not occur and the product 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate would accumulate. The same 
thing would happen in cells unable to make either lactate or 
ethanol: neither would be able to regenerate NAD+, and so 
glycolysis would be blocked at the same step.

Answer 13–2  Arsenate instead of phosphate becomes 
attached in step 6 of glycolysis to form 1-arseno-3-
phosphoglycerate (Figure A13–2). Because of its sensitivity 
to hydrolysis in water, the high-energy bond is destroyed 
before the molecule that contains it can diffuse to 
reach the next enzyme. The product of the hydrolysis, 
3-phosphoglycerate, is the same product normally formed 
in step 7 by the action of phosphoglycerate kinase. But 
because hydrolysis occurs nonenzymatically, the energy 
liberated by breaking the high-energy bond cannot be

captured to generate ATP. In Figure 13–7, therefore, the 
reaction corresponding to the downward-pointing arrow 
would still occur, but the wheel that provides the coupling 
to ATP synthesis is missing. Arsenate wastes metabolic 
energy by uncoupling many phosphotransfer reactions by 
the same mechanism, which is why it is so poisonous.

Answer 13–3  The oxidation of fatty acids breaks the 
carbon chain into two-carbon units (acetyl groups) that 
become attached to CoA. Conversely, during biogenesis, 
fatty acids are constructed by linking together acetyl 
groups. Most fatty acids therefore have an even number of 
carbon atoms.

(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:21)

Answer 13–4  Because the function of the citric acid 
cycle is to harvest the energy released during the oxidation, 
it is advantageous to break the overall reaction into as many 
steps as possible (see Figure 13–1). Using a two-carbon 
compound, the available chemistry would be much more 
limited, and it would be impossible to generate as many 
intermediates.

It is true that oxygen atoms are returned 

Answer 13–5 
as part of CO2 to the atmosphere. The CO2 released 
from the cells, however, does not contain those specific 
oxygen atoms that were consumed as part of the oxidative 
phosphorylation process and converted into water. One can 
show this directly by incubating living cells in an atmosphere 
that includes molecular oxygen containing the 18O isotope 
of oxygen instead of the naturally abundant isotope, 16O. 
In such an experiment, one finds that all the CO2 released 
from cells contains only 16O. Therefore, the oxygen atoms 
in the released CO2 molecules do not come directly from 
the atmosphere but from organic molecules that the cell has 
first made and then oxidized as fuel (see top of first page of 
Panel 13–2, pp. 434–435).

Answer 13–6  The cycle continues because intermediates 
are replenished as necessary by reactions leading into 
the citric acid cycle (instead of away from it). One of the 
most important reactions of this kind is the conversion 
of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate 
carboxylase:

pyruvate + CO2 + ATP + H2O → 
oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi + 2H+

This is one of the many examples of how metabolic 
pathways are carefully coordinated to work together to 
maintain appropriate concentrations of all metabolites 
required by the cell (see Figure A13–6).
Answer 13–7  The carbon atoms in sugar molecules are

Answer 13–8
A.  False. If this were the case, then the reaction would 
be useless for the cell. No chemical energy would be 
harvested in a useful form (e.g., ATP) to be used for 
metabolic processes. (Cells would be nice and warm, 
though!)

B.  False. No energy-conversion process can be 100% 

efficient. Recall that entropy in the universe always has 
to increase, and for most reactions this is accomplished 
by releasing heat.

C.  True. The carbon atoms in glucose are in a reduced state 

compared with those in CO2, in which they are fully 
oxidized.

D.  False. The reaction does indeed produce some water, 

but water is so abundant in the biosphere that this is no 
more than “a drop in the ocean.”

E.   True. If it had occurred in only one step, then all the 

energy would be released at once and it would be 
impossible to harness it efficiently to drive other 
reactions, such as the synthesis of ATP.

F.   False. Molecular oxygen (O2) is used only in the very last 

step of the reaction.

G.  True. Plants convert CO2 into sugars by harvesting the 
energy of light in photosynthesis. O2 is produced in the 
process and released into the atmosphere by plant cells.

H.  True. Anaerobically growing cells use glycolysis to 

oxidize sugars to pyruvate. Animal cells convert pyruvate 
to lactate, and no CO2 is produced; yeast cells, however, 
convert pyruvate to ethanol and CO2. It is this CO2 
gas, released from yeast cells during fermentation, that 
makes bread dough rise and that carbonates beer and 
champagne.

Answer 13–9  Darwin exhaled the carbon atom, which 
therefore must be the carbon atom of a CO2 molecule. 
After spending some time in the atmosphere, the CO2 
molecule must have entered a plant cell, where it became 
“fixed” by photosynthesis and converted into part of a 

sugar molecule. While it is certain that these early steps 
must have happened this way, there are many different 
paths from there that the carbon atom could have taken. 
The sugar could have been broken down by the plant cell 
into pyruvate or acetyl CoA, for example, which then could 
have entered biosynthetic reactions to build an amino 
acid. The amino acid might have been incorporated into 
a plant protein, maybe an enzyme or a protein that builds 
the cell wall. You might have eaten the delicious leaves of 
the plant in your salad, and digested the protein in your 
gut to produce amino acids again. After circulating in your 
bloodstream, the amino acid might have been taken up by 
a developing red blood cell to make its own protein, such 
as the hemoglobin in question. If we wish, of course, we can 
make our food chain scenario more complicated. The plant, 
for example, might have been eaten by an animal that in 
turn was consumed by you during lunch break. Moreover, 
because Darwin died more than 100 years ago, the carbon 
atom could have traveled such a route many times. In each 
round, however, it would have started again as fully oxidized 
CO2 gas and entered the living world following its reduction 
during photosynthesis.

Answer 13–10 Yeast cells grow much better aerobically. 
Under anaerobic conditions they cannot perform oxidative 
phosphorylation and therefore have to produce all their 
ATP by glycolysis, which is less efficient. Whereas one 
glucose molecule yields a net gain of two ATP molecules 
by glycolysis, the additional use of the citric acid cycle and 
oxidative phosphorylation boosts the energy yield up to 
about 30 ATP molecules.

Answer 13–11 The amount of free energy stored in 
the phosphate bond in creatine phosphate is larger than 
that of the anhydride bonds in ATP. Hydrolysis of creatine 
phosphate can therefore be directly coupled to the 
production of ATP.

creatine phosphate + ADP → creatine + ATP

The ΔGº for this reaction is –3 kcal/mole, indicating that it 
proceeds rapidly to the right, as written.

Answer 13–12 The extreme conservation of glycolysis is 
some of the evidence that all present cells are derived from 
a single founder cell as discussed in Chapter 1. The elegant 
reactions of glycolysis would therefore have evolved only 
once, and then they would have been inherited as cells 
evolved. The later invention of oxidative phosphorylation 
allowed follow-up reactions to capture 15 times more 
energy than is possible by glycolysis alone. This remarkable 
efficiency is close to the theoretical limit and hence virtually 
eliminates the opportunity for further improvements. Thus, 
the generation of alternative pathways would result in no 
obvious reproductive advantage that would have been 
selected in evolution.

Answer 13–13 If one glucose produces 30 ATPs, then 
to generate 109 ATP molecules will require 1 × 109/30 = 
3.3 × 107 glucose molecules and 6 × 3.3 × 107 = 
2 × 108 molecules of oxygen. Thus in one minute the cell will 
consume 2 × 108/(6 × 1023) or 3.3 × 10 –16 moles of oxygen, 
which would occupy 3.3 × 10 –16 × 22.4 = 7.4 × 10–15 liters in 
gaseous form. The volume of the cell is 10–15 cubic meters 
(= (10–5)3), which is 10 –12 liter. The cell therefore consumes 
about 0.7% of its volume of O2 gas every minute, or its own 
volume of O2 gas in 2 hours and 15 minutes.

Answer 14–1  By making membranes permeable to

A:37

diminishes—the proton gradient across the inner 
mitochondrial membrane. Cells continue to oxidize food 
molecules to feed high-energy electrons into the electron-
transport chain, but H+ ions pumped across the membrane 
flow back into the mitochondria in a futile cycle. As a result, 
the energy of the electrons cannot be tapped to drive ATP 
synthesis, and instead is released as heat. Patients who have 
been given small doses of DNP lose weight because their 
fat reserves are used more rapidly to feed the electron-
transport chain, and the whole process simply “wastes” 
energy as heat. 
   A similar mechanism of heat production is used naturally 
in a specialized tissue composed of brown fat cells, which 
is abundant in newborn humans and in hibernating animals. 
These cells are packed with mitochondria that leak part of 
their H+ gradient futilely back across the membrane for the 
sole purpose of warming up the organism. These cells are 
brown because they are packed with mitochondria, which 
contain high concentrations of pigmented proteins, such as 
cytochromes.

Answer 14–2  The inner mitochondrial membrane is the 
site of oxidative phosphorylation, and it produces most 
of the cell’s ATP. Cristae are portions of the mitochondrial 
inner membrane that are folded inward. Mitochondria that 
have a higher density of cristae have a larger area of inner 
membrane and therefore a greater capacity to carry out 
oxidative phosphorylation. Heart muscle expends a lot of 
energy during its continuous contractions, whereas skin 
cells have a smaller energy demand. An increased density of 
cristae therefore increases the ATP-production capacity of 
the heart muscle cell. This is a remarkable example of how 
cells adjust the abundance of their individual components 
according to need.

Answer 14–3 
A.  The DNP collapses the electrochemical proton gradient 
completely. H+ ions that are pumped to one side of the 
membrane flow back freely, and therefore no energy to 
drive ATP synthesis can be stored across the membrane. 

B.  An electrochemical gradient is made up of two 

components: a concentration gradient and an electrical 
potential. If the membrane is made permeable to K+ 
with nigericin, K+ will be driven into the matrix by the 
electrical potential of the inner membrane (negative 
inside, positive outside). The influx of positively charged 
K+ will abolish the membrane’s electrical potential. 
In contrast, the concentration component of the H+ 
gradient (the pH difference) is unaffected by nigericin. 
Therefore, only part of the driving force that makes it 
energetically favorable for H+ ions to flow back into the 
matrix is lost.

Answer 14–4 
A.  Such a turbine running in reverse is an electrically 

driven water pump, which is analogous to what the 
ATP synthase becomes when it uses the energy of ATP 
hydrolysis to pump protons against their electrochemical 
gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

B.  The ATP synthase should stall when the energy that it 
can draw from the proton gradient is just equal to the 
ΔG required to make ATP; at this equilibrium point 
there will be neither net ATP synthesis nor net ATP 
consumption. 

C.  As the cell uses up ATP, the ATP/ADP ratio in the matrix

falls below the equilibrium point just described, and ATP 
synthase uses the energy stored in the proton gradient 
to synthesize ATP in order to restore the original ATP/
ADP ratio. Conversely, when the electrochemical proton 
gradient drops below that at the equilibrium point, ATP 
synthase uses ATP in the matrix to restore this gradient.

Answer 14–5   An electron pair causes 10 H+ to be 
pumped across the membrane when passing from NADH 
to O2 through the three respiratory complexes. Four H+ are 
needed to make each ATP: three for synthesis from ADP 
and one for ATP export to the cytosol. Therefore, 2.5 ATP 
molecules are synthesized from each NADH molecule. 

Answer 14–6  One can describe four essential roles for 
the proteins in the process. First, the chemical environment 
provided by a protein’s amino acid side chains sets the 
redox potential of each Fe ion such that electrons can be 
passed in a defined order from one component to the next, 
giving up their energy in small steps and becoming more 
firmly bound as they proceed. Second, the proteins position 
the Fe ions so that the electrons can move efficiently 
between them. Third, the proteins prevent electrons from 
skipping an intermediate step; thus, as we have learned for 
other enzymes (discussed in Chapter 4), they channel the 
electron flow along a defined path. Fourth, the proteins 
couple the movement of the electrons down their energy 
ladder to the pumping of protons across the membrane, 
thereby harnessing the energy that is released and storing it 
in a proton gradient that is then used for ATP production.

It would not be productive to use the

same carrier in two steps. If ubiquinone, for example, could 
transfer electrons directly to the cytochrome c oxidase, the 
cytochrome c reductase complex would often be skipped 
when electrons are collected from NADH dehydrogenase. 
Given the large difference in redox potential between 
ubiquinone and cytochrome c oxidase, a large amount of 
energy would be released as heat and thus be wasted. 
Electron transfer directly between NADH dehydrogenase 
and cytochrome c would similarly allow the cytochrome c 
reductase complex to be bypassed. 

Answer 14–8  Protons pumped across the inner 
mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space 
equilibrate with the cytosol, which functions as a huge 
H+ sink. Both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol 
support many metabolic reactions that require a pH 
around neutrality. The H+ concentration difference, ΔpH, 
that can be achieved between the mitochondrial matrix 
and the cytosol is therefore relatively small (less than one 
pH unit). Much of the energy stored in the mitochondrial 
electrochemical proton gradient is instead due to the 
membrane potential (see Figure 14–15).  
   In contrast, chloroplasts have a smaller, dedicated 
compartment into which H+ ions are pumped. Much 
higher concentration differences can be achieved (up to a 
thousandfold, or 3 pH units), and much of the energy stored 
in the thylakoid H+ gradient is due to the H+ concentration 
difference between the thylakoid space and the stroma. 

Answer 14–9  NADH and NADPH differ by the presence 
of a single phosphate group. That phosphate gives NADPH 
a slightly different shape from NADH, which allows these 
molecules to be recognized by different enzymes, and 
thus to deliver their electrons to different destinations. 

Such a division of labor is useful because NADPH tends to 
be involved in biosynthetic reactions, where high-energy 
electrons are used to produce energy-rich biological 
molecules. NADH, on the other hand, is involved in 
reactions that oxidize energy-rich food molecules to 
produce ATP. Inside the cell, the ratio of NAD+ to NADH is 
kept high, whereas the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH is kept 
low. This provides plenty of NAD+ to act as an oxidizing 
agent and plenty of NADPH to act as a reducing agent—as 
required for their special roles in catabolism and anabolism, 
respectively.

Answer 14–10 
A.  Photosynthesis produces sugars, most importantly 

sucrose, that are transported from the photosynthetic 
cells through the sap to root cells. There, the sugars are 
oxidized by glycolysis in the root cell cytoplasm and by 
oxidative phosphorylation in the root cell mitochondria 
to produce ATP, as well as being used as the building 
blocks for many other metabolites. 

B.  Mitochondria are required even during daylight hours in 

chloroplast-containing cells to supply the cell with ATP 
derived by oxidative phosphorylation. Glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate made by photosynthesis in chloroplasts 
moves to the cytosol and is eventually used as a source 
of energy to drive ATP production in mitochondria.

Answer 14–11 All statements are correct. 
A.  This is a necessary condition. If it were not true, 

electrons could not be removed from water and the 
reaction that splits water molecules (H2O → 2H+ + ½O2 
+ 2e–) would not occur.

B.  Only when excited by light energy does chlorophyll have 

a low enough affinity for an electron to pass it to an 
electron carrier with a low electron affinity. This transfer 
allows the energy of the photon to be harnessed as 
energy that can be utilized in chemical conversions. 

C.  It can be argued that this is one of the most important 

obstacles that had to be overcome during the 
evolution of photosynthesis: partially reduced oxygen 
molecules, such as the superoxide radical O2
dangerously reactive and will attack and destroy almost 
any biologically active molecule. These intermediates 
therefore have to remain tightly bound to the metals in 
the active site of the enzyme until all four electrons have 
been removed from two water molecules. This requires 
the sequential capture of four photons by the same 
reaction center.

Answer 14–12
A.  True. NAD+ and quinones are examples of compounds 

that do not have metal ions but can participate in 
electron transfer. 

B.  False. The potential is due to protons (H+) that are 

pumped across the membrane from the matrix to the 
intermembrane space. Electrons remain bound to 
electron carriers in the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

C.  True. Both components add to the driving force that 

makes it energetically favorable for H+ to flow back into 
the matrix.

D.  True. Both move rapidly in the plane of the membrane.
E.  False. Not only do plants need mitochondria to make 
ATP in cells that do not have chloroplasts, such as root 
cells, but mitochondria make most of the cytosolic ATP 
in all plant cells.

F.  True. Chlorophyll’s physiological function requires it 
to absorb light; heme just happens to be a colored 
compound from which blood derives its red color. 

G.  False. Chlorophyll absorbs light and transfers energy in 
the form of an energized electron, whereas the iron in 
heme is a simple electron carrier. 

H.  False. Most of the dry weight of a tree comes from 

carbon derived from the CO2 that has been fixed during 
photosynthesis.

Answer 14–13 It takes three protons. The precise value of 
the ΔG for ATP synthesis depends on the concentrations of 
ATP, ADP, and Pi (as described in Chapter 3). The higher the 
ratio of the concentration of ATP to ADP, the more energy 
it takes to make additional ATP. The lower value of 11 kcal/
mole therefore applies to conditions where cells have 
expended a lot of energy and have therefore decreased the 
normal ATP/ADP ratio. 
Answer 14–14 If no O2 is available, all components of 
the mitochondrial electron-transport chain will accumulate 
in their reduced form. This is the case because electrons 
derived from NADH enter the chain but cannot be 
transferred to O2. The electron-transport chain therefore 
stalls with all of its components in the reduced form. If O2 is 
suddenly added again, the electron carriers in cytochrome 
c oxidase will become oxidized before those in NADH 
dehydrogenase. This is true because, after O2 addition, 
cytochrome c oxidase will donate its electrons directly 
to O2, thereby becoming oxidized. A wave of increasing 
oxidation then passes backward with time from cytochrome 
c oxidase through the components of the electron-transport 
chain, as each component regains the opportunity to pass 
on its electrons to downstream components.

Answer 14–15 As oxidized ubiquinone becomes reduced, 
it picks up two electrons but also two protons from water 
(Figure 14–23). Upon oxidation, these protons are released. 
If reduction occurs on one side of the membrane and 
oxidation at the other side, a proton is pumped across 
the membrane for each electron transported. Electron 
transport by ubiquinone thereby contributes directly to the 
generation of the H+ gradient.
Answer 14–16 Photosynthetic bacteria and plant cells 
use the electrons derived in the reaction 2H2O → 4e– + 
4H+ + O2 to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, which is then used 
to produce useful metabolites. If the electrons were used 
instead to produce H2 in addition to O2, the cells would 
lose any benefit they derive from carrying out the reaction, 
because the electrons could not take part in metabolically 
useful reactions. 

Answer 14–17
A.  The switch in solutions creates a pH gradient across 

the thylakoid membrane. The flow of H+ ions down its 
electrochemical potential drives ATP synthase, which 
converts ADP to ATP. 

B.  No light is needed, because the H+ gradient is 

established artificially without a need for the light-driven 
electron-transport chain. 

C.  Nothing. The H+ gradient would be in the wrong 

direction; ATP synthase would not work. 

D.  The experiment provided early supporting evidence for 
the chemiosmotic model by showing that an H+ gradient 
alone is sufficient to drive ATP synthesis.

Answer 14–18
A.  When the vesicles are exposed to light, H+ ions 

(derived from H2O) pumped into the vesicles by the 
bacteriorhodopsin flow back out through the ATP 
synthase, causing ATP to be made in the solution 
surrounding the vesicles in response to light. 

B.  If the vesicles are leaky, no H+ gradient can form and 

thus ATP synthase cannot work. 

C.  Using components from widely divergent organisms 

can be a very powerful experimental tool. Because 
the two proteins come from such different sources, 
it is very unlikely that they form a direct functional 
interaction. The experiment therefore strongly suggests 
that electron transport and ATP synthesis are separate 
events. This approach is therefore a valid one.

Answer 14–19 The redox potential of FADH2 is too low 
to transfer electrons to the NADH dehydrogenase complex, 
but high enough to transfer electrons to ubiquinone (Figure 
14–24). Therefore, electrons from FADH2 can enter the 
electron-transport chain only at this step (Figure A14–19). 
Because the NADH dehydrogenase complex is bypassed, 
fewer H+ ions are pumped across the membrane and less 
ATP is made. This example shows the versatility of the 
electron-transport chain. The ability to use vastly different 
sources of electrons from the environment to feed electron 
transport is thought to have been an essential feature in the 
early evolution of life.

Answer 14–20 If these bacteria used a proton gradient 
to make their ATP in a fashion analogous to that in other 
bacteria (that is, fewer protons inside than outside), they 
would need to raise their cytoplasmic pH even higher than 
that of their environment (pH 10). Cells with a cytoplasmic 
pH greater than 10 would not be viable. These bacteria 
must therefore use gradients of ions other than H+, such 
as Na+ gradients, in the chemiosmotic coupling between 
electron transport and an ATP synthase.

Answer 14–21 Statements A and B are accurate.

Answer 14–22 This experiment would suggest a two-step 
model for ATP synthase function. According to this model, 
the flow of protons through the base of the synthase drives 
rotation of the head, which in turn causes ATP synthesis. In 
their experiment, the authors have succeeded in uncoupling 
these two steps. If rotating the head mechanically is 
sufficient to produce ATP in the absence of any applied 
proton gradient, the ATP synthase is a protein machine 
that indeed functions like a “molecular turbine.” This would 
be a very exciting experiment indeed, because it would 
directly demonstrate the relationship between mechanical 
movement and enzymatic activity. There is no doubt that it 
should be published and that it would become a “classic.”

Answer 14–23 Only under condition (E) is electron 
transfer observed, with cytochrome c becoming reduced. 
A portion of the electron-transport chain has been 
reconstituted in this mixture, so that electrons can flow 
in the energetically favored direction from reduced 
ubiquinone to the cytochrome c reductase complex to 
cytochrome c. Although energetically favorable, the transfer 
in (A) cannot occur spontaneously in the absence of the 
cytochrome c reductase complex to catalyze this reaction. 
No electron flow occurs in the other experiments, whether 
the cytochrome c reductase complex is present or not: in 
experiments (B) and (F) both ubiquinone and cytochrome c 
are oxidized; in experiments (C) and (G) both are reduced; 
and in experiments (D) and (H) electron flow is energetically 
disfavored because an electron in reduced cytochrome c 
has a lower free energy than an electron added to oxidized 
ubiquinone.

Answer 15–1  Although the nuclear envelope forms 
one continuous membrane, it has specialized regions 
that contain special proteins and have a characteristic 
appearance. One such specialized region is the inner nuclear 
membrane. Membrane proteins can indeed diffuse between 
the inner and outer nuclear membranes, at the connections 
formed around the nuclear pores. Those proteins with 
particular functions in the inner membrane, however, are 
usually anchored there by their interaction with other 
components such as chromosomes and the nuclear lamina (a 
protein meshwork underlying the inner nuclear membrane 
that helps give structural integrity to the nuclear envelope). 

Answer 15–2  Eukaryotic gene expression is more 
complicated than prokaryotic gene expression. In particular, 
prokaryotic cells do not have introns that interrupt the 
coding sequences of their genes, so that an mRNA can 
be translated immediately after it is transcribed, without 
a need for further processing (discussed in Chapter 7). In 
fact, in prokaryotic cells, ribosomes start translating most 
mRNAs before transcription is finished. This would have 
disastrous consequences in eukaryotic cells, because most 
RNA transcripts have to be spliced before they can be 
translated. The nuclear envelope separates the transcription 
and translation processes in space and time: a primary RNA 
transcript is held in the nucleus until it is properly processed 
to form an mRNA, and only then is it allowed to leave the 
nucleus so that ribosomes can translate it. 

population, however, is not static; the mRNA is continuously 
moved through the ribosome. Those ribosomes that 
have finished translation dissociate from the 3ʹ end of the 
mRNA and from the ER membrane, but the mRNA itself 
remains bound by other ribosomes, newly recruited from 
the cytosolic pool, that have attached to the 5ʹ end of the 
mRNA and are still translating the mRNA. Depending on its 
length, there are about 10–20 ribosomes attached to each 
membrane-bound mRNA molecule.

Answer 15–4
A.  The internal signal sequence functions as a membrane 

anchor, as shown in Figure 15–17. Because there is 
no stop-transfer sequence, however, the C-terminal 
end of the protein continues to be translocated into 
the ER lumen. The resulting protein therefore has its 
N-terminal domain in the cytosol, followed by a single 
transmembrane segment, and a C-terminal domain in 
the ER lumen (Figure A15–4A).

B.  The N-terminal signal sequence initiates translocation of 
the N-terminal domain of the protein until translocation 
is stopped by the stop-transfer sequence. A cytosolic 
domain is synthesized until the start-transfer sequence 
initiates translocation again. The situation now resembles 
that described in (A), and the C-terminal domain of 
the protein is translocated into the lumen of the ER. 
The resulting protein therefore spans the membrane 
twice. Both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains are 
in the ER lumen, and a loop domain between the two 
transmembrane regions is exposed in the cytosol (Figure 
A15–4b).

C.  It would need a cleaved signal sequence, followed by 

an internal stop-transfer sequence, followed by pairs of 
start- and stop-transfer sequences (Figure A15–4c).

These examples demonstrate that complex protein 
topologies can be achieved by simple variations and 
combinations of the two basic mechanisms shown in Figures 
15–16 and 15–17.

A.  Clathrin coats cannot assemble in the absence of

Answers

A:41

adaptins that link the clathrin to the membrane. At high 
clathrin concentrations and under the appropriate ionic 
conditions, clathrin cages assemble in solution, but 
they are empty shells, lacking other proteins, and they 
contain no membrane. This shows that the information 
to form clathrin baskets is contained in the clathrin 
molecules themselves, which are therefore able to self-
assemble. 

B.  Without clathrin, adaptins still bind to receptors in the 
membrane, but no clathrin coat can form and thus no 
clathrin-coated pits or vesicles are produced. 

C.  Deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits form on the 
membrane, but they do not pinch off to form closed 
vesicles (see Figure A15–13).

D.  Prokaryotic cells do not perform endocytosis. A 

prokaryotic cell therefore does not contain any receptors 
with appropriate cytosolic tails that could mediate 
adaptin binding. Therefore, no clathrin can bind and no 
clathrin coats can assemble. 

Answer 15–6  The preassembled sugar chain allows 
better quality control. The assembled oligosaccharide 
chains can be checked for accuracy before they are added 
to the protein; if a mistake were made in adding sugars 
individually to the protein, the whole protein would have to 
be discarded. Because far more energy is used in building 
a protein than in building a short oligosaccharide chain, 
this is a much more economical strategy. This difficulty 
becomes apparent as the protein moves to the cell 
surface: although sugar chains are continually modified by 
enzymes in various compartments of the secretory pathway, 
these modifications are often incomplete and result in 
considerable heterogeneity of the glycoproteins that leave 
the cell. This heterogeneity is largely due to the restricted 
access that the enzymes have to the sugar trees attached 
to the surface of proteins. The heterogeneity also explains 
why glycoproteins are more difficult to study and purify than 
nonglycosylated proteins.

Answer 15–7  Aggregates of the secretory proteins 
would form in the ER, just as they do in the trans Golgi 
network. As the aggregation is specific for secretory 
proteins, ER proteins would be excluded from the 
aggregates. The aggregates would eventually be degraded.

Answer 15–8  Transferrin without Fe bound does not 
interact with its receptor and circulates in the bloodstream 
until it catches an Fe ion. Once iron is bound, the iron–
transferrin complex can bind to the transferrin receptor on 
the surface of a cell and be endocytosed. Under the acidic 
conditions of the endosome, the transferrin releases its 
iron, but the transferrin remains bound to the transferrin 
receptor, which is recycled back to the cell surface, where 
it encounters the neutral pH environment of the blood. The 
neutral pH causes the receptor to release the transferrin 
into the circulation, where it can pick up another Fe ion to 
repeat the cycle. The iron released in the endosome, like the 
LDL in Figure 15–33, moves on to lysosomes, from where it 
is transported into the cytosol. 
   The system allows cells to take up iron efficiently even 
though the concentration of iron in the blood is extremely 
low. The iron bound to transferrin is concentrated at the 
cell surface by binding to transferrin receptors; it becomes 
further concentrated in clathrin-coated pits, which collect 

the transferrin receptors. In this way, transferrin cycles 
between the blood and endosomes, delivering the iron that 
cells need to grow.

Answer 15–9
A.  True. 
B.  False. The signal sequences that direct proteins to 
the ER contain a core of eight or more hydrophobic 
amino acids. The sequence shown here contains many 
hydrophilic amino acid side chains, including the charged 
amino acids His, Arg, Asp, and Lys, and the uncharged 
hydrophilic amino acids Gln and Ser. 

C.  True. Otherwise they could not dock at the correct 
target membrane or recruit a fusion complex to a 
docking site. 

D.  True. 
E.  True. Lysosomal proteins are selected in the trans Golgi 

network and packaged into transport vesicles that 
deliver them to the late endosome. If not selected, they 
would enter by default into transport vesicles that move 
constitutively to the cell surface. 

F.  False. Lysosomes also digest internal organelles by 

autophagy. 

G.  False. Mitochondria do not participate in vesicular 

transport, and therefore N-linked glycoproteins, 
which are exclusively assembled in the ER, cannot be 
transported to mitochondria.

Answer 15–10 They must contain a nuclear localization 
signal as well. Proteins with nuclear export signals shuttle 
between the nucleus and the cytosol. An example is the A1 
protein, which binds to mRNAs in the nucleus and guides 
them through the nuclear pores. Once in the cytosol, a 
nuclear localization signal ensures that the A1 protein is  
re-imported so that it can participate in the export of 
further mRNAs.

Answer 15–11 Influenza virus enters cells by endocytosis 
and is delivered to endosomes, where it encounters 
an acidic pH that activates its fusion protein. The viral 
membrane then fuses with the membrane of the endosome, 
releasing the viral genome into the cytosol (Figure A15–11). 
NH3 is a small molecule that readily penetrates membranes. 
Thus, it can enter all intracellular compartments, including

Answer 15–12
A.  The problem is that vesicles having two different kinds 
of v-SNAREs in their membrane could dock on either of 
two different membranes.

B.  The answer to this puzzle is currently not known, but 

we can predict that cells must have ways of turning 
the docking ability of SNAREs on and off. This may be 
achieved through other proteins that are, for example, 
co-packaged in the ER with SNAREs into transport 
vesicles and facilitate the interactions of the correct 
v-SNARE with the t-SNARE in the cis Golgi network.

Answer 15–13 Synaptic transmission involves the release 
of neurotransmitters by exocytosis. During this event, the 
membrane of the synaptic vesicle fuses with the plasma 
membrane of the nerve terminals. To make new synaptic 
vesicles, membrane must be retrieved from the plasma 
membrane by endocytosis. This endocytosis step is blocked 
if dynamin is defective, as the protein is required to pinch 
off the clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles. The first clue 
to deciphering the role of dynamin came from electron 
micrographs of synapses of the mutant flies (Figure 
A15–13). Note that there are many flasklike invaginations 
of the plasma membrane, representing deeply invaginated 
clathrin-coated pits that cannot pinch off. The collars visible 
around the necks of these invaginations are made of mutant 
dynamin.

ECB2 EA14.13/A15.13

Answer 15–15 The protein is translocated into the ER. 
Its ER signal sequence is recognized as soon as it emerges 
from the ribosome. The ribosome then becomes bound 
to the ER membrane, and the growing polypeptide chain 
is transferred through the ER translocation channel. The 
nuclear localization sequence is therefore never exposed to 
the cytosol. It will never encounter nuclear import receptors, 
and the protein will not enter the nucleus. 

Answer 15–16 (1) Proteins are imported into the 
nucleus after they have been synthesized, folded, and, 
if appropriate, assembled into complexes. In contrast, 
unfolded polypeptide chains are translocated into the ER 
as they are being made by the ribosomes. Ribosomes are 
assembled in the nucleus yet function in the cytosol, and 

the enzyme complexes that catalyze RNA transcription 
and splicing are assembled in the cytosol yet function 
in the nucleus. Thus, both ribosomes and these enzyme 
complexes need to be transported through the nuclear 
pores intact. (2) Nuclear pores are gates, which are always 
open to small molecules; in contrast, translocation channels 
in the ER membrane are normally closed, and open only 
after the ribosome has attached to the membrane and the 
translocating polypeptide chain has sealed the channel from 
the cytosol. It is important that the ER membrane remain 
impermeable to small molecules during the translocation 
process, as the ER is a major store for Ca2+ in the cell, and 
Ca2+ release into the cytosol must be tightly controlled 
(discussed in Chapter 16). (3) Nuclear localization signals 
are not cleaved off after protein import into the nucleus; in 
contrast, ER signal peptides are usually cleaved off. Nuclear 
localization signals are needed to repeatedly re-import 
nuclear proteins after they have been released into the 
cytosol during mitosis, when the nuclear envelope breaks 
down. 

Answer 15–17 The transient intermixing of nuclear 
and cytosolic contents during mitosis supports the idea 
that the nuclear interior and the cytosol are indeed 
evolutionarily related. In fact, one can consider the nucleus 
as a subcompartment of the cytosol that has become 
surrounded by the nuclear envelope, with access only 
through the nuclear pores.

Answer 15–18 The actual explanation is that the single 
amino acid change causes the protein to misfold slightly 
so that, although it is still active as a protease inhibitor, it 
is prevented by chaperone proteins in the ER from exiting 
this organelle. It therefore accumulates in the ER lumen 
and is eventually degraded. Alternative interpretations 
might have been that (1) the mutation affects the stability 
of the protein in the bloodstream so that it is degraded 
much faster in the blood than the normal protein, or (2) the 
mutation inactivates the ER signal sequence and prevents 
the protein from entering the ER. (3) Another explanation 
could have been that the mutation altered the sequence to 
create an ER retention signal, which would have retained the 
mutant protein in the ER. One could distinguish between 
these possibilities by using fluorescently tagged antibodies 
against the protein or by expressing the protein as a fusion 
with GFP to follow its transport in the cells (see How We 
Know, pp. 512–513).

Answer 15–19 Critique: “Dr. Outonalimb proposes to 
study the biosynthesis of forgettin, a protein of significant 
interest. The main hypothesis on which this proposal is 
based, however, requires further support. In particular, it is 
questionable whether forgettin is indeed a secreted protein, 
as proposed. ER signal sequences are normally found at 
the N-terminus. C-terminal hydrophobic sequences will be 
exposed outside the ribosome only after protein synthesis 
has already terminated and can therefore not be recognized 
by an SRP during translation. It is therefore unlikely that 
forgettin will be translocated by an SRP-dependent 
mechanism; it is more likely that it will remain in the cytosol. 
Dr. Outonalimb should take these considerations into 
account when submitting a revised application.”

receptor, a one-to-one complex of steroid and receptor

there is thus no amplification between ligand binding

each of which is translated to give many copies of the 
protein it encodes (discussed in Chapter 7). For the ion-
channel-coupled receptors, a single ion channel will let 
through thousands of ions in the time it remains open; this 
serves as the amplification step in this type of signaling 
system.
Answer 16–5  The mutant G protein would be almost 
continuously activated, because GDP would dissociate 
spontaneously, allowing GTP to bind even in the absence 
of an activated GPCR. The consequences for the cell would 
therefore be similar to those caused by cholera toxin, which 
modifies the α subunit of Gs so that it cannot hydrolyze 
GTP to shut itself off. In contrast to the cholera toxin case, 
however, the mutant G protein would not stay permanently 
activated: it would switch itself off normally, but then 
it would instantly become activated again as the GDP 
dissociated and GTP re-bound.
Answer 16–6  Rapid breakdown keeps the intracellular 
cyclic AMP concentrations low. The lower the cAMP levels 
are, the larger and faster the increase achieved upon 
activation of adenylyl cyclase, which makes new cyclic AMP. 
If you have $100 in the bank and you deposit another $100, 
you have doubled your wealth; if you have only $10 to start 
with and you deposit $100, you have increased your wealth 
tenfold, a much larger proportional increase resulting from 
the same deposit.
Answer 16–7  Recall that the plasma membrane 
constitutes a rather small area compared with the total 
membrane surfaces in a cell (discussed in Chapter 15). The 
endoplasmic reticulum is especially abundant and spans the 
entire volume of the cell as a vast network of membrane 
tubes and sheets. The Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic 
reticulum can therefore be released throughout the cytosol. 
This is important because the rapid clearing of Ca2+ ions 
from the cytosol by Ca2+ pumps prevents Ca2+ from 
diffusing any significant distance in the cytosol. 
Answer 16–8  Each reaction involved in the amplification 
scheme must be turned off to reset the signaling pathway 
to a resting level. Each of these off switches is equally 
important.

(Figure A15–20), which still communicates with the 
ER by vesicular transport. For the newly evolved Golgi 
compartment to be useful, transport vesicles would also 
have to have evolved. 

Answer 15–21 This is a chicken-and-egg question. 
In fact, the situation never arises in present-day cells, 
although it must have posed a considerable problem 
for the first cells that evolved. New cell membranes are 
made by expansion of existing membranes, and the ER 
is never made de novo. There will always be an existing 
piece of ER with translocation channels to integrate new 
translocation channels. Inheritance is therefore not limited 
to the propagation of the genome; a cell’s organelles must 
also be passed from generation to generation. In fact, the 
ER translocation channels can be traced back to structurally 
related translocation channels in the prokaryotic plasma 
membrane.

Answer 15–23  A single, incomplete round of nuclear 
import would occur. Because nuclear transport is fueled by 
GTP hydrolysis, under conditions of insufficient energy, GTP 
would be used up and no Ran-GTP would be available to 
unload the cargo protein from its nuclear import receptor 
upon arrival in the nucleus (see Figure 15–10). Unable to 
release its cargo, the nuclear import receptor would be 
stuck at the nuclear pore and not return to the cytosol. 
Because the nuclear cargo protein is not released, it would 
not be functional, and no further import could occur.

A:44 

Answers

Answer 16–9  Because each antibody has two antigen-
binding sites, it can cross-link the receptors and cause them 
to cluster on the cell surface. This clustering is likely to 
activate RTKs, which are usually activated by dimerization. 
For RTKs, clustering allows the individual kinase domains 
of the receptors to phosphorylate adjacent receptors in 
the cluster. The activation of GPCRs is more complicated, 
because the ligand has to induce a particular conformational 
change; only very special antibodies mimic receptor ligands 
sufficiently well to induce the conformational change that 
activates a GPCR. 

Answer 16–10 The more steps there are in an intracellular 
signaling pathway, the more places the cell has to regulate 
the pathway, amplify the signal, integrate signals from 
different pathways, and spread the signal along divergent 
paths (see Figure 16–13).

Answer 16–11
A.  True. Acetylcholine, for example, slows the beating of 

heart muscle cells by binding to a GPCR and stimulates 
the contraction of skeletal muscle cells by binding to a 
different acetylcholine receptor, which is an ion-channel-
coupled receptor. 

B.  False. Acetylcholine is short-lived and exerts its effects 

locally. Indeed, the consequences of prolonging its 
lifetime can be disastrous. Compounds that inhibit the 
enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which normally breaks 
down acetylcholine at a nerve–muscle synapse, are 
extremely toxic: for example, the nerve gas sarin, used 
in chemical warfare, is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. 

C.  True. Nucleotide-free βγ complexes can activate ion 

channels, and GTP-bound α subunits can activate 
enzymes. The GDP-bound form of trimeric G proteins is 
the inactive state. 

D.  True. The inositol phospholipid that is cleaved to 

produce IP3 contains three phosphate groups, one of 
which links the sugar to the diacylglycerol lipid. IP3 is 
generated by a simple hydrolysis reaction (see Figure 
16–27). 

E.  False. Calmodulin senses but does not regulate 

intracellular Ca2+ levels. 
F.  True. See Figure 16–40.
G.  True. See Figure 16–32.

Answer 16–12
1.  You would expect a high background level of Ras 

activity, because Ras cannot be turned off  
efficiently. 

2.  Because some Ras molecules are already GTP-bound, 

Ras activity in response to an extracellular signal would 
be greater than normal, but this activity would be liable 
to saturate when all Ras molecules are converted to the 
GTP-bound form. 

3.  The response to a signal would be much less rapid, 

because the signal-dependent increase in GTP-bound 
Ras would occur over an elevated background of 
preexisting GTP-bound Ras (see Question 16–6).

4.  The increase in Ras activity in response to a signal would 
also be prolonged compared to the response in normal 
cells.

Answer 16–13
A.  Both types of signaling can occur over a long range: 
neurons can send action potentials along very long 

axons (think of the axons in the neck of a giraffe, for 
example), and hormones are carried via the bloodstream 
throughout the organism. Because neurons secrete large 
amounts of neurotransmitters at a synapse, a small, well-
defined space between two cells, the concentrations 
of these signal molecules are high; neurotransmitter 
receptors, therefore, need to bind to neurotransmitters 
with only low affinity. Hormones, in contrast, are vastly 
diluted in the bloodstream, where they circulate at often 
minuscule concentrations; hormone receptors therefore 
generally bind their hormone with extremely high 
affinity. 

B.  Whereas neuronal signaling is a private affair, with one 
neuron talking to a select group of target cells through 
specific synaptic connections, endocrine signaling 
is a public announcement, with any target cell with 
appropriate receptors able to respond to the hormone in 
the blood. Neuronal signaling is very fast, limited only by 
the speed of propagation of the action potential and the 
workings of the synapse, whereas endocrine signaling is 
slower, limited by blood flow and diffusion over larger 
distances.

Answer 16–14
A.  There are 100,000 molecules of X and 10,000 molecules 

of Y in the cell (= rate of synthesis × average lifetime). 

B.  After one second, the concentration of X will have 

increased by 10,000 molecules. The concentration of X, 
therefore, one second after its synthesis is increased, 
is about 110,000 molecules per cell—which is a 10% 
increase over the concentration of X before the boost 
of its synthesis. The concentration of Y will also increase 
by 10,000 molecules, which, in contrast to X, represents 
a full twofold increase in its concentration (for simplicity, 
we can neglect the breakdown in this estimation 
because X and Y are relatively stable during the one-
second stimulation).

C.  Because of its larger proportional increase, Y is the 

preferred signaling molecule. This calculation illustrates 
the surprising but important principle that the time it 
takes to switch a signal on is determined by the lifetime 
of the signaling molecule.

Answer 16–15 The information transmitted by a cell 
signaling pathway is contained in the concentration of the 
messenger, be it a small molecule or a phosphorylated 
protein. Therefore, to allow the detection of a change 
in concentration, the original messenger has to be both 
rapidly destroyed and rapidly resynthesized. The shorter the 
average lifetime of the messenger population, the faster 
the system can respond to changes. Human communication 
relies on messages that are delivered only once and that are 
generally not interpreted by their abundance but by their 
content. So it is a mistake to kill the human messengers; 
they can be used more than once.

Answer 16–16
A.  The mutant RTK lacking its extracellular ligand-binding 
domain is inactive. It cannot bind extracellular signals, 
and its presence has no consequences for the function of 
the normal RTK (Figure A16–16A). 

B.  The mutant RTK lacking its intracellular domain is also 

inactive, but its presence will block signaling by the 
normal receptors. When a signal molecule binds to 
either receptor, it will induce their dimerization. Two

tend to dimerize, thereby bringing their intracellular kinase 
domains into proximity so that they can cross-phosphorylate 
and activate each other (Figure A16–17b). 

Answer 16–18 Activation in both cases depends on 
proteins that catalyze GDP–GTP exchange on the G 
protein or Ras protein. Whereas activated GPCRs perform 
this function directly for G proteins, enzyme-linked 
receptors assemble multiple signaling proteins into a 
signaling complex when the receptors are activated by 
phosphorylation; one of these is an adaptor protein that 
recruits a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that fulfills 
this function for Ras.

Answer 16–19 Because the cytosolic concentration of 
Ca2+ is so low, an influx of relatively few Ca2+ ions leads 
to large changes in its cytosolic concentration. Thus, a 
tenfold increase in cytosolic Ca2+ can be achieved by 
raising its concentration into the micromolar range, which 
would require far fewer ions than would be required to 
change significantly the cytosolic concentration of a more 
abundant ion such as Na+. In muscle, a greater than tenfold 
change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration can be achieved 
in microseconds by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum, a task that would be difficult to accomplish if 
changes in the millimolar range were required.

Answer 16–20 In a multicellular organism such as an 
animal, it is important that cells survive only when and 
where they are needed. Having cells depend on signals 
from other cells may be a simple way of ensuring this. A 
misplaced cell, for example, would probably fail to get 
the survival signals it needs (as its neighbors would be 
inappropriate) and would therefore kill itself. This strategy 
can also help regulate cell numbers: if cell type A depends 
on a survival signal from cell type B, the number of B cells 
could control the number of A cells by making a limited 
amount of the survival signal, so that only a certain number 
of A cells could survive. There is indeed evidence that such a 
mechanism does operate to help regulate cell numbers—in 
both developing and adult tissues (see Figure 18–41).
Answer 16–21 Ca2+-activated Ca2+ channels create a 
positive feedback loop: the more Ca2+ that is released, the 
more Ca2+ channels open. The Ca2+ signal in the cytosol 
is therefore propagated explosively throughout the entire 
muscle cell, thereby ensuring that all myosin–actin filaments 
contract almost synchronously. 

Answer 16–22 K2 activates K1. If K1 is permanently 
activated, a response is observed regardless of the status of 
K2. If the order were reversed, K1 would need to activate 
K2, which cannot occur because in our example K2 contains 
an inactivating mutation.

Answer 16–23
A.  Three examples of extended signaling pathways to the 

nucleus are (1) extracellular signal → RTK → adaptor 
protein → Ras-activating protein → MAP kinase 
kinase kinase → MAP kinase kinase → MAP kinase → 
transcription regulator; (2) extracellular signal → GPCR 
→ G protein → phospholipase C → IP3 → Ca2+ → 
calmodulin → CaM-kinase → transcription regulator; 
(3) extracellular signal → GPCR → G protein → adenylyl 
cyclase → cyclic AMP → PKA → transcription regulator.
B.  An example of a direct signaling pathway to the nucleus 
is Delta → Notch → cleaved Notch tail → transcription.

normal receptors have to come together to activate 
each other by phosphorylation. In the presence of an 
excess of mutant receptors, however, normal receptors 
will usually form mixed dimers, in which their intracellular 
domain cannot be activated because their partner is a  
mutant and lacks a kinase domain (Figure A16–16b).

Answer 16–17 The statement is correct. Upon ligand 
binding, transmembrane helices of multispanning receptors, 
like the GPCRs, shift and rearrange with respect to one 
another (Figure A16–17A). This conformational change is 
sensed on the cytosolic side of the membrane because of 
a change in the arrangement of the cytoplasmic loops. A 
single transmembrane segment is not sufficient to transmit 
a signal across the membrane directly; no rearrangements 
in the membrane are possible upon ligand binding. Upon

Answer 16–24 When PI 3-kinase is activated by an

is permanently associated with the membrane also helps 
activate Akt (see Figure 16–35).

Answer 16–25 Animals and plants are thought to have

On the other hand, animal and plant cells are thought to

Chapter 17

Answer 17–1  Cells that migrate rapidly from one place 
to another, such as amoebae (A) and sperm cells (F), do not 
in general need intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm, 
since they do not develop or sustain large tensile forces. 
Plant cells (G) are pushed and pulled by the forces of wind 
and water, but they resist these forces by means of their 
rigid cell walls rather than by their cytoskeleton. Epithelial 
cells (B), smooth muscle cells (C), and the long axons of 
nerve cells (E) are all rich in cytoplasmic intermediate 
filaments, which prevent them from rupturing as they are 
stretched and compressed by the movements of their 
surrounding tissues. 
   All of the above eukaryotic cells possess at least 
intermediate filaments in their nuclear lamina. Bacteria, such 
as Escherichia coli (D), have none whatsoever.

Answer 17–2  Two tubulin dimers have a lower affinity for 
each other (because of a more limited number of interaction 
sites) than a tubulin dimer has for the end of a microtubule 
(where there are multiple possible interaction sites, both 
end-to-end of tubulin dimers adding to a protofilament 
and side-to-side of the tubulin dimers interacting with 
tubulin subunits in adjacent protofilaments forming the 
ringlike cross section). Thus, to initiate a microtubule from 
scratch, enough tubulin dimers have to come together and 
remain bound to one another for long enough for other 
tubulin molecules to add to them. Only when a number 
of tubulin dimers have already assembled will the binding 
of the next subunit be favored. The formation of these 
initial “nucleating sites” is therefore rare and will not occur 
spontaneously at cellular concentrations of tubulin.  
   Centrosomes contain preassembled rings of γ-tubulin 
(in which the γ-tubulin subunits are held together in much 
tighter side-to-side interactions than αβ-tubulin can form) 
to which αβ-tubulin dimers can bind. The binding conditions 
of αβ-tubulin dimers resemble those of adding to the end 
of an assembled microtubule. The γ-tubulin rings in the 
centrosome can therefore be thought of as permanently 
preassembled nucleation sites.

Answer 17–3 
A.  The microtubule is shrinking because it has lost its 

GTP cap, i.e., the tubulin subunits at its end are all in 

their GDP-bound form. GTP-loaded tubulin subunits 
from solution will still add to this end, but they will be 
short-lived—either because they hydrolyze their GTP 
or because they fall off as the microtubule rim around 
them disassembles. If, however, enough GTP-loaded 
subunits are added quickly enough to cover up the GDP-
containing tubulin subunits at the microtubule end, a 
new GTP cap can form and regrowth is favored. 

B.  The rate of addition of GTP-tubulin will be greater at 

higher tubulin concentrations. The frequency with which 
shrinking microtubules switch to the growing mode will 
therefore increase with increasing tubulin concentration. 
The consequence of this regulation is that the system is 
self-balancing: the more microtubules shrink (resulting 
in a higher concentration of free tubulin), the more 
frequently microtubules will start to grow again. 
Conversely, the more microtubules grow, the lower the 
concentration of free tubulin will become and the rate of 
GTP-tubulin addition will slow down; at some point GTP 
hydrolysis will catch up with new GTP-tubulin addition, 
the GTP cap will be destroyed, and the microtubule will 
switch to the shrinking mode. 

C.  If only GDP were present, microtubules would continue 

to shrink and eventually disappear, because tubulin 
dimers with GDP have very low affinity for each other 
and will not add stably to microtubules.

D.  If GTP is present but cannot be hydrolyzed, microtubules 

will continue to grow until all free tubulin subunits have 
been used up.

If all the dynein arms were equally 

Answer 17–4 
active, there could be no significant relative motion of one 
microtubule to the other as required for bending (think of a 
circle of nine weightlifters, each trying to lift his neighbor off 
the ground: if they all succeeded, the group would levitate!). 
Thus, a few ciliary dynein molecules must be activated 
selectively on one side of the cilium. As they move their 
neighboring microtubules toward the tip of the cilium, the 
cilium bends away from the side containing the activated 
dyneins. 

Answer 17–5  Any actin-binding protein that stabilizes 
complexes of two or more actin monomers without blocking 
the ends required for filament growth will facilitate the 
initiation of a new filament (nucleation).

Answer 17–6  Only fluorescent actin molecules 
assembled into filaments are visible, because unpolymerized 
actin molecules diffuse so rapidly they produce a dim 
uniform background. Since, in your experiment, so few 
actin molecules are labeled (1:10,000), there should be at 
most one labeled actin monomer per filament (see Figure 
17–29). The lamellipodium as a whole has many actin 
filaments, some of which overlap and therefore show a 
random speckled pattern of actin molecules, each marking a 
different filament.  
   This technique (called “speckle fluorescence”) can be used 
to follow the movement of polymerized actin in a migrating 
cell. If you watch this pattern with time, you will see that 
individual fluorescent spots move steadily back from the 
leading edge toward the interior of the cell, a movement 
that occurs whether or not the cell is actually migrating. 
Rearward movement takes place because actin monomers 
are added to filaments at the plus end and are lost from 
the minus end (where they are depolymerized) (see Figure 

17–35B). In effect, actin monomers “move through” the 
actin filaments, a phenomenon termed “treadmilling.” 
Treadmilling has been demonstrated to occur in isolated 
actin filaments in solution and also in dynamic microtubules, 
such as those within a mitotic spindle.

Answer 17–7  Cells contain actin-binding proteins that 
bundle and cross-link actin filaments (see Figure 17–32). 
The filaments extending from lamellipodia and filopodia 
become firmly connected to the filamentous meshwork of 
the cell cortex, thus providing the mechanical anchorage 
required for the growing rodlike filaments to deform the cell 
membrane. 
Answer 17–8  Although the subunits are indeed held 
together by noncovalent bonds that are individually weak, 
there are a very large number of them, distributed among 
a very large number of filaments. As a result, the stress a 
human being exerts by lifting a heavy object is dispersed 
over so many subunits that their interaction strength is not 
exceeded. By analogy, a single thread of silk is not nearly 
strong enough to hold a human, but a rope woven of such 
fibers is.
Answer 17–9  Both filaments are composed of subunits 
in the form of protein dimers that are held together by 
coiled-coil interactions. Moreover, in both cases, the dimers 
polymerize through their coiled-coil domains into filaments. 
Whereas intermediate filament dimers assemble head-to-
head, however, and thereby create a filament that has no 
polarity, all myosin molecules in the same half of the myosin 
filament are oriented with their heads pointing in the same 
direction. This polarity is necessary for them to be able to 
develop a contractile force in muscle.
Answer 17–10
A.  Successive actin molecules in an actin filament are 
identical in position and conformation. After a first 
protein (such as troponin) had bound to the actin 
filament, there would be no way in which a second 
protein could recognize every seventh monomer in a 
naked actin filament. Tropomyosin, however, binds along 
the length of an actin filament, spanning precisely seven 
monomers, and thus provides a molecular “ruler” that 
measures the length of seven actin monomers. Troponin 
becomes localized by binding to the evenly spaced ends 
of tropomyosin molecules. 

B.  Calcium ions influence force generation in the actin–

myosin system only if both troponin (to bind the calcium 
ions) and tropomyosin (to transmit the information 
that troponin has bound calcium to the actin filament) 
are present. (i) Troponin cannot bind to actin without 
tropomyosin. The actin filament would be permanently 
exposed to the myosin, and the system would be 
continuously active, independently of whether calcium 
ions were present or not (a muscle cell would therefore 
be continuously contracted with no possibility of 
regulation). (ii) Tropomyosin would bind to actin and 
block binding of myosin completely; the system would 
be permanently inactive, no matter whether calcium 
ions were present, because tropomyosin is not affected 
by calcium. (iii) The system will contract in response to 
calcium ions.

Answer 17–11
A.  True. A continual outward movement of ER is required; 
in the absence of microtubules, the ER collapses toward 

Answers

the center of the cell. 

B.  True. Actin is needed to make the contractile ring that 

causes the physical cleavage between the two daughter 
cells, whereas the mitotic spindle that partitions the 
chromosomes is composed of microtubules. 

C.  True. Both extensions are associated with 

transmembrane proteins that protrude from the plasma 
membrane and enable the cell to form new anchor 
points on the substratum. 

D.  False. To cause bending, ATP is hydrolyzed by the 

dynein motor proteins that are attached to the outer 
microtubules in the flagellum. 

E.  False. Cells could not divide without rearranging 
their intermediate filaments, but many terminally 
differentiated and long-lived cells, such as nerve cells, 
have stable intermediate filaments that are not known to 
depolymerize. 

F.  False. The rate of growth is independent of the size of 

the GTP cap. The plus and minus ends have different 
growth rates because they have physically distinct 
binding sites for the incoming tubulin subunits; the rate 
of addition of tubulin subunits differs at the two ends. 

G.  True. Both are nice examples of how the same 

membrane can have regions that are highly specialized 
for a particular function. 

H.  False. Myosin movement is activated by the 

phosphorylation of myosin, or by calcium binding to 
troponin.

Answer 17–12 The average time taken for a small 
molecule (such as ATP) to diffuse a distance of 10 μm is 
given by the calculation

(10–3)2 / (2 × 5 × 10–6) = 0.1 seconds

Similarly, a protein takes 1 second and a vesicle 10 seconds 
on average to travel 10 μm. A vesicle would require on 
average 109 seconds, or more than 30 years, to diffuse to 
the end of a 10-cm axon. This calculation makes it clear why 
kinesin and other motor proteins evolved to carry molecules 
and organelles along microtubules.

Answer 17–13 (1) Animal cells are much larger and more 
diversely shaped, and do not have a cell wall. Cytoskeletal 
elements are required to provide mechanical strength and 
shape in the absence of a cell wall. (2) Animal cells, and 
all other eukaryotic cells, have a nucleus that is shaped 
and held in place in the cell by intermediate filaments; the 
nuclear lamins attached to the inner nuclear membrane 
support and shape the nuclear membrane, and a meshwork 
of intermediate filaments surrounds the nucleus and spans 
the cytosol. (3) Animal cells can move by a process that 
requires a change in cell shape. Actin filaments and myosin  
motor proteins are required for these activities.  
(4) Animal cells have a much larger genome than bacteria; 
this genome is fragmented into many chromosomes. 
For cell division, chromosomes need to be accurately 
distributed to the daughter cells, requiring the function of 
the microtubules that form the mitotic spindle. (5) Animal 
cells have internal organelles. Their localization in the cell 
is dependent on motor proteins that move them along 
microtubules. A remarkable example is the long-distance 
travel of membrane-enclosed vesicles (organelles) along 
microtubules in an axon that can be up to 1 m (≈3 ft) long in 
the case of the nerve cells that extend from your spinal cord 
to your feet.

filaments, intermediate filaments therefore have no polarity.

Answer 17–15 Intermediate filaments have no polarity; 
their ends are chemically indistinguishable. It would

Answer 17–16 Katanin breaks microtubules along their 
length, and at positions remote from their GTP caps. The 
fragments that form therefore contain GDP-tubulin at 
their exposed ends and rapidly depolymerize. Katanin 
thus provides a very quick means of destroying existing 
microtubules. 

Answer 17–17 Cell division depends on the ability of 
microtubules both to polymerize and to depolymerize. This 
is most obvious when one considers that the formation of 
the mitotic spindle requires the prior depolymerization of 
other cellular microtubules to free up the tubulin required 
to build the spindle. This rearrangement is not possible 
in Taxol-treated cells, whereas in colchicine-treated cells, 
division is blocked because a spindle cannot be assembled. 
On a more subtle but no less important level, both drugs 
block the dynamic instability of microtubules and would 
therefore interfere with the workings of the mitotic spindle, 
even if one could be properly assembled. 

Answer 17–18 Motor proteins are unidirectional in 
their action; kinesin always moves toward the plus end 
of a microtubule and dynein toward the minus end. Thus 
if kinesin molecules are attached to glass, only those 
individual motors that have the correct orientation in 
relation to the microtubule that settles on them can attach 
to the microtubule and exert force on it to propel it forward. 
Since kinesin moves toward the plus end of the microtubule, 
the microtubule will always crawl minus-end first over the 
coverslip.

Answer 17–19
A.  Phase A corresponds to a lag phase, during which 

tubulin molecules assemble to form nucleation centers 
(Figure A17–19A). Nucleation is followed by a rapid 
rise (phase B) to a plateau value as tubulin dimers add 
to the ends of the elongating microtubules (Figure 
A17–19b). At phase C, equilibrium is reached with some 
microtubules in the population growing while others are 
rapidly shrinking (Figure A17–19c). The concentration 
of free tubulin is constant at this point, because 
polymerization and depolymerization are balanced (see 
also Question 17–3, p. 577). 

B.  The addition of centrosomes introduces nucleation sites 
that eliminate the lag phase A as shown by the red curve 
in Figure A17–19D. The rate of microtubule growth (i.e., 
the slope of the curve in the elongation phase B) and 
the equilibrium level of free tubulin remain unchanged, 
because the presence of centrosomes does not affect 
the rates of polymerization and depolymerization.

Answer 17–20 The ends of the shrinking microtubule 
are visibly frayed, and the individual protofilaments appear 
to come apart and curl as the end depolymerizes. This 
micrograph therefore suggests that the GTP cap (which is 
lost from shrinking microtubules) holds the protofilaments 
properly aligned with each other, perhaps by strengthening 
the side-to-side interactions between αβ-tubulin subunits 
when they are in their GTP-bound form.

Answer 17–21 Cytochalasin interferes with actin filament 
formation, and its effect on the cell demonstrates the 
importance of actin to cell locomotion. The experiment with 
colchicine shows that microtubules are required to give a 
cell a polarity that then determines which end becomes 
the leading edge (see Figure 17–14). In the absence of 
microtubules, cells still go through the motions normally 
associated with cell movement, such as the extension of 
lamellipodia, but in the absence of cell polarity these are 
futile exercises because they happen indiscriminately in all 
directions.  
   Antibodies bind tightly to the antigen (in this case 
vimentin) to which they were raised (see Panel 4–2,  
pp. 146–147). When bound, an antibody can interfere with 

the function of the antigen by preventing it from interacting 
properly with other cell components. The antibody injection 
experiment therefore suggests that intermediate filaments 
are not required for the maintenance of cell polarity or for 
the motile machinery. 

Answer 17–22 Either (B) or (C) would complete the 
sentence correctly. The direct result of the action potential 
in the plasma membrane is the release of Ca2+ into the 
cytosol from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; muscle cells are 
triggered to contract by this rapid rise in cytosolic Ca2+. 
Calcium ions at high concentrations bind to troponin, which 
in turn causes tropomyosin to move to expose myosin-
binding sites on the actin filaments. (A) and (D) would be 
wrong because Ca2+ has no effect on the detachment 
of the myosin head from actin, which is the result of ATP 
hydrolysis. Nor does it have any role in maintaining the 
structure of the myosin filament.

Answer 17–23 Only (D) is correct. Upon contraction, the 
Z discs move closer together, and neither actin nor myosin 
filaments contract (see Figures 17–41 and 17–42).

Chapter 18

Answer 18–1  Because all cells arise by division of 
another cell, this statement is correct, assuming that “first 
cell division” refers to the division of the successful founder 
cell from which all life as we know it has derived. There were 
probably many other unsuccessful attempts to start the 
chain of life.

Answer 18–2  Cells in peak B contain twice as much DNA 
as those in peak A, indicating that they contain replicated 
DNA, whereas the cells in peak A contain unreplicated DNA. 
Peak A therefore contains cells that are in G1, and peak B 
contains cells that are in G2 and mitosis. Cells in S phase 
have begun but not finished DNA synthesis; they therefore 
have various intermediate amounts of DNA and are found 
in the region between the two peaks. Most cells are in G1, 
indicating that it is the longest phase of the cell cycle (see 
Figure 18–2).

Answer 18–3  For multicellular organisms, the control of 
cell division is extremely important. Individual cells must not 
proliferate unless it is to the benefit of the whole organism. 
The G0 state offers protection from aberrant activation of 
cell division, because the cell-cycle control system is largely 
dismantled. If, on the other hand, a cell just paused in G1, 
it would still contain all of the cell-cycle control system and 
could readily be induced to divide. The cell would also have 
to remake the “decision” not to divide almost continuously. 
To re-enter the cell cycle from G0, a cell has to resynthesize 
all of the components that have disappeared.

Answer 18–4  The cell would replicate its damaged 
DNA and therefore would introduce mutations to the two 
daughter cells when the cell divides. Such mutations could 
increase the chances that the progeny of the affected 
daughter cells would eventually become cancer cells.

Answer 18–5  Before injection, the frog oocytes must 
contain inactive M-Cdk. Upon injection of the M-phase 
cytoplasm, the small amount of the active M-Cdk in 
the injected cytoplasm activates the inactive M-Cdk by 
switching on the activating phosphatase (Cdc25), which 

Answers

A:49

removes the inhibitory phosphate groups from the inactive 
M-Cdk (see Figure 18–17). An extract of the second oocyte, 
now in M phase itself, will therefore contain as much active 
M-Cdk as the original cytoplasmic extract, and so on. 

Answer 18–6  The experiment shows that kinetochores 
are not preassigned to one or other spindle pole; 
microtubules attach to the kinetochores that they are able 
to reach. For the chromosomes to remain attached to a 
microtubule, however, tension has to be exerted. Tension 
is normally achieved by the opposing pulling forces from 
opposite spindle poles. The requirement for such tension 
ensures that if two sister kinetochores ever become 
attached to the same spindle pole, so that tension is not 
generated, one or both of the connections would be lost, 
and microtubules from the opposing spindle pole would 
have another chance to attach properly.

Answer 18–7  Recall from Figure 18–30 that the new 
nuclear envelope reassembles on the surface of the 
chromosomes. The close apposition of the envelope to 
the chromosomes prevents cytosolic proteins from being 
trapped between the chromosomes and the envelope. 
Nuclear proteins are then selectively imported through 
the nuclear pores, causing the nucleus to expand while 
maintaining its characteristic protein composition.

Answer 18–8  The membranes of the Golgi vesicles fuse 
to form part of the plasma membranes of the two daughter 
cells. The interiors of the vesicles, which are filled with cell-
wall material, become the new cell-wall matrix separating 
the two daughter cells. Proteins in the membranes of the 
Golgi vesicles thus become plasma membrane proteins. 
Those parts of the proteins that were exposed to the lumen 
of the Golgi vesicle will end up exposed to the new cell wall 
(Figure A18–8).

In a eukaryotic organism, the genetic 

Answer 18–9 
information that the organism needs to survive and 
reproduce is distributed between multiple chromosomes. It 
is therefore crucial that each daughter cell receives a copy 
of each chromosome when a cell divides; if a daughter cell 
receives too few or too many chromosomes, the effects 
are usually deleterious or even lethal. Only two copies of 
each chromosome are produced by chromosome replication 
in mitosis. If the cell were to randomly distribute the 
chromosomes when it divided, it would be very unlikely 
that each daughter cell would receive precisely one copy 

A:50 

Answers

of each chromosome. In contrast, the Golgi apparatus 
fragments into tiny vesicles that are all alike, and by random 
distribution it is very likely that each daughter cell will 
receive an approximately equal number of them.

Answer 18–10 As apoptosis occurs on a large scale 
in both developing and adult tissues, it must not trigger 
alarm reactions that are normally associated with cell injury. 
Tissue injury, for example, leads to the release of signal 
molecules that stimulate the proliferation of surrounding 
cells so that the wound heals. It also causes the release of 
signals that can cause a destructive inflammatory reaction. 
Moreover, the release of intracellular contents could elicit an 
immune response against molecules that are normally not 
encountered by the immune system. Such reactions would 
be self-defeating if they occurred in response to the massive 
cell death that occurs in normal development.

Answer 18–11 Because the cell population is increasing 
exponentially, doubling its weight at every cell division, the 
weight of the cell cluster after N cell divisions is 
2N × 10–9 g. Therefore, 70 kg (70 × 103 g) = 2N × 10–9 g, 
or 2N = 7 × 1013. Taking the logarithm of both sides 
allows you to solve the equation for N. Therefore, 
N = ln (7 × 1013) / ln 2 = 46; i.e., it would take only 
46 days if cells proliferated exponentially. Cell division in 
animals is tightly controlled, however, and most cells in 
the human body stop dividing when they become highly 
specialized. The example demonstrates that exponential cell 
proliferation occurs only for very brief periods, even during 
embryonic development.

Answer 18–12 The egg cells of many animals are big 
and contain stores of enough cell components to last for 
many cell divisions. The daughter cells that form during 
the first cell divisions after fertilization are progressively 
smaller in size and thus can be formed without a need for 
new protein or RNA synthesis. Whereas normally dividing 
cells would grow continuously in G1, G2, and S phases, until 
their size doubled, there is no cell growth in these early 
cleavage divisions, and both G1 and G2 are virtually absent. 
As G1 is usually longer than G2 and S phase, G1 is the most 
drastically reduced in these divisions.

Answer 18–13
A.  Radiation leads to DNA damage, which activates a 

checkpoint mechanism (mediated by p53 and p21; see 
Figure 18–15) that arrests the cell cycle until the DNA 
has been repaired.

B.  The cell will replicate damaged DNA and thereby 

introduce mutations in the daughter cells when the cell 
divides. 

C.  The cell will be able to divide normally, but it will be 

prone to mutations, because some DNA damage always 
occurs as the result of natural irradiation caused, for 
example, by cosmic rays. The checkpoint mechanism 
mediated by p53 is mainly required as a safeguard 
against the devastating effects of accumulating DNA 
damage, but not for the natural progression of the cell 
cycle in undamaged cells. 

D.  Cell division in humans is an ongoing process that does 

not cease upon reaching maturity, and it is required 
for survival. Blood cells and epithelial cells in the skin 
or lining the gut, for example, are being constantly 
produced by cell division to meet the body’s needs;  

each day, your body produces about 1011 new red blood 
cells alone.

Answer 18–14
A.  Only the cells that were in the S phase of their cell cycle 

(i.e., those cells making DNA) during the 30-minute 
labeling period contain any radioactive DNA.

B.  Initially, mitotic cells contain no radioactive DNA 

because these cells were not engaged in DNA synthesis 
during the labeling period. Indeed, it takes about two 
hours before the first labeled mitotic cells appear. 

C.  The initial rise of the curve corresponds to cells that 

were just finishing DNA replication when the radioactive 
thymidine was added. The curve rises as more labeled 
cells enter mitosis; the peak corresponds to those cells 
that had just started S phase when the radioactive 
thymidine was added. The labeled cells then exit from 
mitosis, and are replaced by unlabeled mitotic cells, 
which were not yet in S phase during the labeling period. 
After 20 hours the curve starts rising again, because the 
labeled cells enter their second round of mitosis. 

D.  The intial two-hour lag before any labeled mitotic cells 
appear corresponds to the G2 phase, which is the time 
between the end of S phase and the beginning of 
mitosis. The first labeled cells seen in mitosis were those 
that were just finishing S phase (DNA synthesis) when 
the radioactive thymidine was added.

Answer 18–15 Loss of M cyclin leads to inactivation of 
M-Cdk. As a result, the M-Cdk target proteins become 
dephosphorylated by phosphatases, and the cells exit from 
mitosis: they disassemble the mitotic spindle, reassemble 
the nuclear envelope, decondense their chromosomes, and 
so on. The M cyclin is degraded by ubiquitin-dependent 
destruction in proteasomes, and the activation of M-Cdk 
leads to the activation of the APC, which ubiquitylates 
the cyclin, but with a substantial delay. As discussed in 
Chapter 7, ubiquitylation tags proteins for degradation in 
proteasomes.

Answer 18–16 M cyclin accumulates gradually as it is 
steadily synthesized. As it accumulates, it will tend to 
form complexes with the mitotic Cdk molecules that are 
present. After a certain threshold level has been reached, 
a sufficient amount of M-Cdk has been formed so that it 
is activated by the appropriate kinases and phosphatases 
that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate it. Once activated, 
M-Cdk acts to enhance the activity of the activating 
phosphatase; this positive feedback leads to the explosive 
activation of M-Cdk (see Figure 18–17). Thus, M-cyclin 
accumulation acts like a slow-burning fuse, which eventually 
helps trigger the explosive self-activation of M-Cdk. The 
precipitous destruction of M cyclin terminates M-Cdk 
activity, and a new round of M-cyclin accumulation begins.

Answer 18–17 The order is G, C, B, A, D. Together, these 
five steps are referred to as mitosis (F). No step in mitosis 
is influenced by the phases of the moon (E). Cytokinesis is 
the last step in M phase, which overlaps with anaphase and 
telophase. Mitosis and cytokinesis are both part of M phase.

Answer 18–18 If the growth rate of microtubules is 
the same in mitotic and in interphase cells, their length is 
proportional to their lifetime. Thus, the average length of 
microtubules in mitosis is 1 μm (= 20 μm × 15 s/300 s).

Answer 18–19 As shown in Figure A18–19, the 
overlapping interpolar microtubules from opposite poles 
of the spindle have their plus ends pointing in opposite 
directions. Plus-end-directed motor proteins cross-link 
adjacent antiparallel microtubules together and tend to 
move the microtubules in the direction that will push the 
two poles of the spindle apart, as shown in the figure. 
Minus-end-directed motor proteins also cross-link adjacent 
antiparallel microtubules together but move in the opposite 
direction, tending to pull the spindle poles together (not 
shown).

Answer 18–20 The sister chromatid becomes committed 
when a microtubule from one of the spindle poles 
attaches to the kinetochore of the chromatid. Microtubule 
attachment is still reversible until a second microtubule from 
the other spindle pole attaches to the kinetochore of its 
partner sister chromatid so that the duplicated chromosome 
is now put under mechanical tension by pulling forces from 

both poles. The tension ensures that both microtubules 
remain attached to the chromosome. The position of a 
chromatid in the cell at the time that the nuclear envelope 
breaks down will influence which spindle pole it will be 
pulled to, as its kinetochore is most likely to become 
attached to the spindle pole toward which it is facing.

Answer 18–21 It is still not certain what drives the 
poleward movement of chromosomes during anaphase. 
In principle, two possible models could explain it (Figure 
A18–21). In the model shown in (A), microtubule motor 
proteins associated with the kinetochore dash toward the 
minus end of the depolymerizing microtubule, dragging 
the chromosome toward the pole. Although this model 
is appealingly simple, there is little evidence that motor 
proteins are required for chromosome movement during 
anaphase. Instead, current experimental evidence 
greatly supports the model outlined in (B). In this model, 
chromosome movement is driven by kinetochore proteins

that cling to the sides of the depolymerizing microtubule. 
These proteins frequently detach from—and reattach to—
the kinetochore microtubule. As tubulin subunits continue to 
dissociate, the kinetochore must slide poleward to maintain 
its grip on the retreating end of the shrinking microtubule.

Answer 18–22 Both sister chromatids could end up in the 
same daughter cell for any of a number of reasons. (1) If the 
microtubules or their connections with a kinetochore were 
to break during anaphase, both sister chromatids could be 
drawn to the same pole, and hence into the same daughter 
cell. (2) If microtubules from the same spindle pole attached 
to both kinetochores, the chromosome would be pulled to 
the same pole. (3) If the cohesins that link sister chromatids 
were not degraded, the pair of chromatids might be pulled 
to the same pole. (4) If a duplicated chromosome never 
engaged microtubules and was left out of the spindle, it 
would also end up in one daughter cell. 

Some of these errors in the mitotic process would be 

expected to activate a checkpoint mechanism that delays 
the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are attached 
properly to both poles of the spindle. This “spindle 
assembly checkpoint” mechanism should allow most 
chromosome attachment errors to be corrected, which is 
one reason why such errors are rare. 
   The consequences of both sister chromatids ending 
up in one daughter cell are usually dire. One daughter 
cell would contain only one copy of all the genes carried 
on that chromosome and the other daughter cell would 
contain three copies. The altered gene dosage, leading 
to correspondingly changed amounts of the mRNAs and 
proteins produced, is often detrimental to the cell. In 
addition, there is the possibility that the single copy of the 
chromosome may contain a defective gene with a critical 
function, which would normally be taken care of by the 
good copy of the gene on the other chromosome that is 
now missing.

Answer 18–23
A.  True. Centrosomes replicate during interphase, before M 

phase begins. 

B.  True. Sister chromatids separate completely only at the 

start of anaphase. 

C.  False. The ends of interpolar microtubules overlap and 

attach to one another via proteins (including motor 
proteins) that bridge between the microtubules. 

D.  False. Microtubules and their motor proteins play no role 

in DNA replication. 

E.  False. To be a correct statement, the terms 

“centromere” and “centrosome” must be switched. 

Answer 18–24 Antibodies bind tightly to the antigen 
(in this case myosin) to which they were raised. When 
bound, an antibody can interfere with the function of the 
antigen by preventing it from interacting properly with 
other cell components. (A) The movement of chromosomes 
at anaphase depends on microtubules and their motor 
proteins and does not depend on actin or myosin. Injection 
of an anti-myosin antibody into a cell will therefore have no 
effect on chromosome movement during anaphase.  
(B) Cytokinesis, on the other hand, depends on the 
assembly and contraction of a ring of actin and myosin 
filaments, which forms the cleavage furrow that splits the 
cell in two. Injection of anti-myosin antibody will therefore 
block cytokinesis.

Answer 18–25 The plasma membrane of the cell that 
died by necrosis in Figure 18–37A is ruptured; a clear break 
is visible, for example, at a position corresponding to the 
12 o’clock mark on a watch. The cell’s contents, mostly 
membranous and cytoskeletal debris, are seen spilling 
into the surroundings through these breaks. The cytosol 
stains lightly, because most soluble cell components were 
lost before the cell was fixed. In contrast, the cell that 
underwent apoptosis in Figure 18–37B is surrounded by 
an intact membrane, and its cytosol is densely stained, 
indicating a normal concentration of cell components. The 
cell’s interior is remarkably different from a normal cell, 
however. Particularly characteristic are the large “blobs” 
that extrude from the nucleus, probably as the result of the 
breakdown of the nuclear lamina. The cytosol also contains 
many large, round, membrane-enclosed vesicles of unknown 
origin, which are not normally seen in healthy cells. The 
pictures visually confirm the notion that necrosis involves 
cell lysis, whereas cells undergoing apoptosis remain 
relatively intact until they are phagocytosed and digested 
by another cell.

Answer 18–26
A.  False. There is no G1 to M phase transition. The 

statement is correct, however, for the G1 to S phase 
transition, in which cells commit themselves to a division 
cycle. 

B.  True. Apoptosis is an active process carried out by 

special proteases (caspases).

C.  True. This mechanism is thought to adjust the number of 

neurons to the number of specific target cells to which 
the neurons connect.

D.  True. An amazing evolutionary conservation! 
E.  True. Association of a Cdk protein with a cyclin is 

required for its activity (hence its name cyclin-dependent 
kinase). Furthermore, phosphorylation at a specific site 
and dephosphorylation at other sites on the Cdk protein 
are required for the cyclin–Cdk complex to be active. 

Answer 18–27 Cells in an animal must behave for the 
good of the organism as a whole—to a much greater 
extent than people generally act for the good of society as 
a whole. In the context of an organism, unsocial behavior 
would lead to a loss of organization and to cancer. Many 
of the rules that cells have to obey would be unacceptable 
in a human society. Most people, for example, would be 
reluctant to kill themselves for the good of society, yet our 
cells do it all the time.

Answer 18–28 The most likely approach to success (if that 
is what the goal should be called) is plan C, which should 
result in an increase in cell numbers. The problem is, of 
course, that cell numbers of each tissue must be increased 
similarly to maintain balanced proportions in the organism, 
yet different cells respond to different growth factors. As 
shown in Figure A18–28, however, the approach has indeed 
met with limited success. A mouse producing very large 
quantities of growth hormone (left)—which acts to stimulate 
the production of a secreted protein that acts as a survival 
factor, growth factor, or mitogen, depending on the cell 
type—grows to almost twice the size of a normal mouse 
(right). To achieve this twofold change in size, however, 
growth hormone was massively overproduced (about 
fiftyfold). And note that the mouse did not even attain the 
size of a rat, let alone a dog.

The other approaches have conceptual problems: 
A.  Blocking all apoptosis would lead to defects in 

development, as rat development requires the selective 
death of many cells. It is unlikely that a viable animal 
would be obtained. 

B.  Blocking p53 function would eliminate an important 

checkpoint of the cell cycle that detects DNA damage 
and stops the cycle so that the cell can repair the 
damage; removing p53 would increase mutation rates 
and lead to cancer. Indeed, mice without p53 usually 
develop normally but die of cancer at a young age.

Answer 18–29 The on-demand, limited release of PDGF 
at a wound site triggers cell division of neighboring cells 
for a limited amount of time, until the PDGF is degraded. 
This is different from the continuous release of PDGF from 
mutant cells, where PDGF is made in an uncontrolled way 
at high levels. Moreover, the mutant cells that make PDGF 
often express their own PDGF receptor inappropriately, 
so that they can stimulate their own proliferation, thereby 
promoting the development of cancer. 

Answer 18–30 All three types of mutant cells would be 
unable to divide. The cells 
A.  would enter mitosis but would not be able to exit 

mitosis.

B.  would arrest permanently in G1 because the cyclin–Cdk 

complexes that act in G1 would be inactivated.

C.  would not be able to activate the transcription of 

genes required for cell division because the required 
transcription regulators would be constantly inhibited by 
unphosphorylated Rb. 

Answer 18–31 In alcoholism, liver cells proliferate 
because the organ is overburdened and becomes 
damaged by the large amounts of alcohol that have to be 
metabolized. This need for more liver cells activates the 
control mechanisms that normally regulate cell proliferation. 
Unless badly damaged and full of scar tissue, the liver will 
usually shrink back to a normal size after the patient stops 
drinking excessively. In liver cancer, in contrast, mutations 
abolish normal cell proliferation control and, as a result, 
cells divide and keep on dividing in an uncontrolled manner, 
which is usually fatal.

Answer 19–1  Although each daughter cell ends up with 
a diploid amount of DNA after the first meiotic division, 
each cell has effectively only a haploid set of chromosomes 
(albeit in two copies), representing only one or other 
homolog of each type of chromosome (although some 
mixing will have occurred during crossing-over). Because 
the maternal and paternal chromosomes of a pair will carry 
different versions of many of the genes, these daughter 
cells will not be genetically identical; each one will, however, 
have lost either the paternal or the maternal version of each 
chromosome. In contrast, somatic cells dividing by mitosis 
inherit a diploid set of chromosomes, and all daughter 
cells are genetically identical and inherit both maternal 
and paternal gene copies. The role of gametes produced 
by meiosis is to mix and reassort gene pools during sexual 
reproduction, and thus it is a definite advantage for each 
of them to have a slightly different genetic constitution. 
The role of somatic cells on the other hand is to build an 
organism that contains the same genes in all its cells and 
retains in each cell both maternal and paternal genetic 
information.

Answer 19–2  A typical human female produces fewer 
than 1000 mature eggs in her lifetime (12 per year over 
about 40 years); this is less than one-tenth of a percent 
of the possible gametes, excluding the effects of meiotic 
crossing-over. A typical human male produces billions of 
sperm during a lifetime, so in principle, every possible 
chromosome combination is sampled many times.

Answer 19–3  For simplicity, consider the situation 
where a father carries genes for two dominant traits, M 
and N, on one of his two copies of human Chromosome 1. 
If these two genes were located at opposite ends of this 
chromosome, and there were one and only one crossover 
event per chromosome as postulated in the question, half 
of his children would express trait M and the other half 
would express trait N—with no child resembling the father 
in carrying both traits. This is very different from the actual 
situation, where there are multiple crossover events per 
chromosome, causing the traits M and N to be inherited as 
if they were on separate chromosomes. By constructing a 
Punnett square like that in Figure 19–27, one can see that 
in this latter, more realistic case, we would actually expect 
one-fourth of the children of this father to inherit both traits, 
one-fourth to inherit trait M only, one-fourth to inherit trait 
N only, and one-fourth to inherit neither trait.

Answer 19–4 
Inbreeding tends to give rise to individuals 
who are homozygous for many genes. To see why, consider 
the extreme case where inbreeding takes the form of 
brother–sister matings (as among the Pharaohs of ancient 
Egypt): because the parents are closely related, there is 
a high probability that the maternal and paternal alleles 
inherited by the offspring will be the same. Inbreeding 
continued over many generations gives rise to individuals 
who are all alike and homozygous for almost every 
gene. Because of the randomness of the mechanism of 
inheritance, there is a large chance that some deleterious  
alleles will become prevalent in the population in this way, 
giving all individuals a reduced fitness. In another, separate 
inbred population, the same thing will happen, but chances 
are a different set of deleterious alleles will become 

A:54 

Answers

prevalent. When individuals from the two separate inbred 
populations mate, their offspring will inherit deleterious 
alleles of genes A, B, and C for example, from the mother, 
but good alleles of those genes from the father; conversely, 
they will inherit deleterious alleles of genes D, E, and F from 
the father, but good alleles of those genes from the mother. 
Most deleterious mutations are recessive. The hybrid 
offspring, because they are heterozygous for these genes, 
will thus escape the deleterious effects seen in the parents. 

Answer 19–5  Although any one of the three 
explanations could in principle account for the observed 
result, A and B can be ruled out as being implausible. 
A.  There is no precedent for any instability in DNA so great 

as to be detectable in such a SNP analysis; in any case, 
the hypothesis would predict a steady decrease in the 
frequency of the SNP with age, not a drop in frequency 
that begins only at age 50. 

B.  Human genes change only very slowly over time (unless 

a massive population migration brings an influx of 
individuals who are genetically different). People born 
50 years ago will be, on average, virtually the same 
genetically as the population being born today. 

C.  This hypothesis is correct. A SNP with these properties 
has been used to discover a gene that appears to cause 
a substantial increase in the probability of death from 
cardiac abnormalities.

Answer 19–6  Natural selection alone is not sufficient 
to eliminate recessive lethal genes from the population. 
Consider the following line of reasoning. Homozygous 
defective individuals can arise only as the offspring of a 
mating between two heterozygous individuals. By the rules 
of Mendelian genetics, offspring of such a mating will be 
in the ratio of 1 homozygous normal: 2 heterozygous: 1 
homozygous defective. Thus, statistically, heterozygous 
individuals should always be more numerous than the 
homozygous, defective individ uals. And although natural 
selection effectively eliminates the defective genes in 
homozygous individuals through death, it cannot act to 
eliminate the defective genes in heterozygous individuals 
because they do not affect the phenotype. Natural selection 
will keep the frequency of the defective gene low in 
the population, but, in the absence of any other effect, 
there will always be a reservoir of defective genes in the 
heterozygous individuals.

    At low frequencies of the defective gene, another 

important factor—chance—comes into play. Chance 
variation can increase or decrease the frequency of 
heterozygous individuals (and thereby the frequency of 
the defective gene). By chance, the offspring of a mating 
between heterozygotes could all be normal, which would 
eliminate the defective gene from that lineage. Increases 
in the frequency of a deleterious gene are opposed by 
natural selection; however, decreases are unopposed and 
can, by chance, lead to elimination of the defective gene 
from the population. On the other hand, new mutations 
are continually occurring, albeit at a low rate, creating 
fresh copies of the deleterious recessive allele. In a large 
population, a balance will be struck between the creation 
of new copies of the allele in this way, and their elimination 
through the death of homozygotes.

Answer 19–7
A.  True.

B.  True.
C.  False. Mutations that occur during meiosis can be 

propagated, unless they give rise to nonviable gametes.

Answer 19–8  Two copies of the same chromosome can 
end up in the same daughter cell if one of the microtubule 
connections breaks before sister chromatids are separated. 
Alternatively, microtubules from the same spindle pole 
could attach to both kinetochores of the chromosome. As 
a consequence, one daughter cell would receive only one 
copy of all the genes carried on that chromosome, and 
the other daughter cell would receive three copies. The 
imbalance of the genes on this chromosome compared 
with the genes on all the other chromosomes would 
produce imbalanced levels of protein which, in most cases,  
is detrimental to the cell. If the mistake happens during 
meiosis, in the process of gamete formation, it will be 
propagated in all cells of the organism. A form of mental 
retardation called Down syndrome, for example, is due to 
the presence of three copies of Chromosome 21 in all of the 
nucleated cells in the body.

Answer 19–9  Meiosis begins with DNA replication, 
producing a tetraploid cell containing four copies of each 
chromosome. These four copies have to be distributed 
equally during the two sequential meiotic divisions into four 
haploid cells. Sister chromatids remain paired so that (1) the 
cells resulting from the first division receive two complete 
sets of chromosomes and (2) the chromosomes can be 
evenly distributed again in the second meiotic division. If 
the sister chromatids did not remain paired, it would not 
be possible in the second division to distinguish which 
chromatids belong together, and it would therefore be 
difficult to ensure that precisely one copy of each chromatid 
is pulled into each daughter cell. Keeping two sister 
chromatids paired in the first meiotic division is therefore 
an easy way to keep track of which chromatids belong 
together.

   This biological principle suggests that you might 

consider clamping your socks together in matching pairs 
before putting them into the laundry. In this way, the 
cumbersome process of sorting them out afterward—and 
the seemingly inevitable mistakes that occur during that 
process—could be avoided.

Answer 19–10
A.  A gene is a stretch of DNA that codes for a protein 
or functional RNA. An allele is an alternative form of 
a gene. Within the population, there are often several 
“normal” alleles, whose functions are indistinguishable. 
In addition, there may be many rare alleles that are 
defective to varying degrees. An individual, however, 
normally carries a maximum of two alleles of each gene.
B.  An individual is said to be homozygous if the two alleles 

of a gene are the same. An individual is said to be 
heterozygous if the two alleles of a gene are different. 
An individual can be heterozygous for gene A and 
homozygous for gene B.

C.  The genotype is the specific set of alleles present in 

the genome of an individual. In practice, for organisms 
studied in a laboratory, the genotype is usually specified 
as a list of the known differences between the individual 
and the wild type, which is the standard, naturally 
occurring type. The phenotype is a description of the 
visible characteristics of the individual. In practice, the 

Answers

A:55

phenotype is usually a list of the differences in visible 
characteristics between the individual and the wild type.

D.  An allele A is dominant (relative to a second allele a) if 

the presence of even a single copy of A is enough to 
affect the phenotype; that is, if heterozygotes (with 
genotype Aa) appear different from aa homozygotes. 
An allele a is recessive (relative to a second allele A) 
if the presence of a single copy makes no difference 
to the phenotype, so that Aa individuals look just like 
AA individuals. If the phenotype of the heterozygous 
individual differs from the phenotypes of individuals that 
are homozygous for either allele, the alleles are said to 
be co-dominant.

Answer 19–11
A.  Since the pea plant is diploid, any true-breeding plant 
must carry two mutant copies of the same gene—both 
of which have lost their function.

B.  No, the same phenotype can be produced by mutations 

in different genes.

C.  If each plant carries a mutation in a different gene, this 

will be revealed by complementation tests (see Panel 
19–1, p. 669). When plant A is crossed with plant B, all 
of the F1 plants will produce only round peas. And the 
same result will be obtained when plant B is crossed 
with plant C, or when plant A is crossed with plant C. In 
contrast, a cross between any two true-breeding plants 
that carry loss-of-function mutations in the same gene 
should produce only plants with wrinkled peas. This is 
true if the mutations themselves lie in different parts of 
the gene.

Answer 19–12
A.  The mutation is likely to be dominant, because roughly 

half of the progeny born to an affected parent—in 
each of three marriages to hearing partners—are deaf, 
and it is unlikely that all these hearing partners were 
heterozygous carriers of the mutation.

B.  The mutation is present on an autosome. If it were 
instead carried on a sex chromosome, either only 
the female progeny should be affected (expected if 
the mutation arose in a gene on the grandfather’s X 
chromosome), or only the male progeny should be 
affected (expected if the mutation arose in a gene on 
the grandfather’s Y chromosome). In fact, the pedigree 
reveals that both males and females have inherited the 
mutant form of the gene.

 

C.  Suppose that the mutation was present on one of the 
two copies of the grandfather’s Chromosome 12. Each 
of these copies of Chromosome 12 would be expected 
to carry a different pattern of SNPs, since one of them 
was inherited from his father and the other was inherited 
from his mother. Each of the copies of Chromosome 
12 that was passed to his grandchildren will have gone 
through two meioses—one meiosis per generation.
   Because two or three crossover events occur per 
chromosome during a meiosis, each chromosome 
inherited by a grandchild will have been subjected 
to about five crossovers since it left the grandfather, 
dividing it into six segments. An identical pattern 
of SNPs should surround whatever gene causes the 
deafness in each of the four affected grandchildren; 
moreover, this SNP pattern should be clearly different 
from that surrounding the same gene in each of the 
seven grandchildren who are normal. These SNPs 

would form an unusually long haplotype block—one 
that extends for about one-sixth of the length of 
Chromosome 12. (One-quarter of the DNA of each 
grandchild will have been inherited from the grandfather, 
in roughly 70 segments of this length scattered among 
the grandchild’s 46 chromosomes.)

Answer 19–13 Individual 1 might be either heterozygous 
(+/–) or homozygous for the normal allele (+/+). Individual 2 
must be homozygous for the recessive deafness allele (–/–). 
(Both his parents must have been heterozygous because 
they produced a deaf son.) Individual 3 is almost certainly 
heterozygous (+/–) and responsible for transmitting the 
mutant allele to his children and grandchildren. Given 
that the mutant allele is rare, individual 4 is most probably 
homozygous for the normal allele (+/+). 

Answer 19–14 Your friend is wrong. 
A.  Mendel’s laws, and the clear understanding that we now 

have concerning the mechanisms that produce them, 
rule out many false ideas concerning human heredity. 
One of them is that a first-born child has a different 
chance of inheriting particular traits from its parents than 
its siblings. 

B.  The probability of this type of pedigree arising by 

chance is one-fourth for each generation, or one in 64 
for the three generations shown. 

C.  Data from an enlarged sampling of family members, or 

from more generations, would quickly reveal that the 
regular pattern observed in this particular pedigree 
arose by chance. 

D.  An opposite result, if it had strong statistical significance, 

would suggest that some process of selection was 
involved: for example, parents who had had a first child 
that was affected might regularly opt for screening of 
subsequent pregnancies and selectively terminate those 
pregnancies in which the fetus was found to be affected. 
Fewer second children would then be born with the 
abnormality.

Answer 19–15 Each carrier is a heterozygote, and 50% 
of his sperm or her eggs will carry the lethal allele. When 
two carriers marry, there is therefore a 25% chance that any 
baby will inherit the lethal allele from both parents and so 
will show the fatal phenotype. Because one person in 100 
is a carrier, one partnership in 10,000 (100 × 100) will be a 
partnership of carriers (assuming that people choose their 
partners at random). Other things being equal, one baby in 
40,000 will then be born with the defect, or 25 babies per 
year out of a total of a million babies born.

Answer 19–16 A dominant-negative mutation gives rise 
to a mutant gene product that interferes with the function 
of the normal gene product, causing a loss-of-function 
phenotype even in the presence of a normal copy of the 
gene. For example, if a protein forms a hexamer, and 
the mutant protein can interact with the normal subunits 
and inhibit the function of the hexamer, the mutation will 
be dominant. This ability of a single defective allele to 
determine the phenotype is the reason why such an allele 
is dominant. A gain-of-function mutation increases the 
activity of the gene or makes it active in inappropriate 
circumstances. The change in activity often has a phenotypic 
consequence, which is why such mutations are usually 
dominant.

Answer 19–17 This statement is largely true. Diabetes 
is one of the oldest diseases described by humans, dating 
at least back to the time of the ancient Greeks. Diabetes 
itself comes from the Greek word for siphon, which was 
used to describe the main symptoms: “The disease was 
called diabetes, as though it were a siphon, because it 
converts the human body into a pipe for the transflux of 
liquid humors” (in other words, untreated patients have 
constant thirst, balanced by high output of urine). If there 
were no human disease, the role of insulin would not have 
come to our attention in so demanding a way. We would 
have ultimately understood its role—and by now may have. 
Yet it is difficult to overstate the case for the role of disease 
in focusing our efforts toward a molecular understanding. 
Even today, the quest to understand and alleviate human 
disease is a principal driving force in biomedical research.

Answer 19–18
A.  As outlined in Figure A19–18, if flies that are defective 

in different genes mate, their progeny will have one 
normal gene at each locus. In the case of a mating 
between a ruby-eyed fly and a white-eyed fly, every 
progeny fly will inherit one functional copy of the white 
gene from one parent and one functional copy of the 
ruby gene from the other parent. Note that the normal 
white allele produces brick-red eyes and the mutated 
form of the gene produces white eyes. Because each 
of the mutant alleles is recessive to the corresponding 
wild-type allele, the progeny will have the wild-type 
phenotype—brick-red eyes.

B.  Garnet, ruby, vermilion, and carnation complement one 

another and the various alleles of the white gene (that is, 
when these mutant flies are mated with each other, they 
produce flies with a normal eye color); thus each of these 
mutants defines a separate gene. In contrast, white, 
cherry, coral, apricot, and buff do not complement each 
other; thus, they must be alleles of the same gene, 

which has been named the white gene. Thus, these nine 
different eye-color mutants define five different genes.
C.  Different alleles of the same gene, like the five alleles 

of the white gene, often have different phenotypes. 
Different mutations compromise the function of the 
gene product to different extents, depending on the 
location of the mutation. Alleles that do not produce any 
functional product (null alleles), even if they result from 
different DNA sequence changes, do have the same 
phenotype.

Answer 19–19 SNPs are single-nucleotide differences 
between individuals for which two or more variants are each 
found at high frequency in the population. In the human 
population, SNPs occur roughly once per 1000 nucleotides 
of sequence. Many have been identified and mapped in 
various organisms, including several million in the human 
genome. SNPs, which can be detected by sequencing or 
oligonucleotide hybridization, serve as physical markers 
whose genomic locations are known. By tracking a mutant 
gene through different matings, and correlating the 
presence of the gene with the co-inheritance of particular 
SNP variants, one can narrow down the potential location of 
a gene to a chromosomal region that may contain only a few 
genes. These candidate genes can then be tested for the 
presence of a mutation that could account for the original 
mutant phenotype (see Figure 19–38).

Answer 20–2
A.  As three collagen chains have to come together to 

form the triple helix, a defective molecule will impair 
assembly, even if normal collagen chains are  
present at the same time. Collagen mutations are 
therefore dominant; that is, they have a deleterious 
effect even in the presence of a normal copy of  
the gene. 

B.  The different severity of the mutations results from a 
polarity in the assembly process. Collagen monomers 
assemble into the triple-helical rod starting from their 
amino-terminal ends. A mutation in an “early” glycine 
therefore allows only short rods to form, whereas a 
mutation farther downstream allows for longer, more 
normal rods. 

Answer 20–3  The remarkable ability to swell and thus 
occupy a large volume of space depends on the negative 
charges. These attract a cloud of positive ions, chiefly Na+, 
which by osmosis draw in large amounts of water, thus 
giving proteoglycans their unique properties. Uncharged 
polysaccharides such as cellulose, starch, and glycogen, by 
contrast, are easily compacted into fibers or granules.

Answer 20–4  Focal contact sites are common in 
connective tissue, where fibroblasts exert traction forces 
on the extracellular matrix, and in cell culture, where cell 
crawling is observed. The forces for pulling on matrix or 
for driving crawling movement are generated by the actin 
cytoskeleton. In mature epithelium, focal contact sites are 
presumably less prominent because the cells are largely 
fixed in place and have no need to crawl over the basal 
lamina or actively pull on it.

Answer 20–5  Suppose a cell is damaged so that its 
plasma membrane becomes leaky. Ions present in high 
concentration in the extracellular fluid, such as Na+ and 
Ca2+, then rush into the cell, and valuable metabolites leak 
out. If the cell were to remain connected to its healthy 
neighbors, these too would suffer from the damage. But 
the influx of Ca2+ into the sick cell causes its gap junctions 
to close immediately, effectively isolating the cell and 
preventing damage from spreading in this way.

through matter, knocking electrons out of their orbits and 
breaking chemical bonds. In particular, it creates breaks and 
other damage in DNA, and thus causes cells to arrest in 
the cell cycle (discussed in Chapter 18). If the damage is so 
severe that it cannot be repaired, cells become permanently 
arrested and undergo apoptosis; that is, they activate a 
suicide program.

Answer 20–7  Cells in the gut epithelium are exposed to 
a quite hostile environment, containing digestive enzymes 
and many other substances that vary drastically from day 
to day depending on the food intake of the organism. 
The epithelial cells also form a first line of defense against 
potentially hazardous compounds and mutagens that are 
ubiquitous in our environment. The rapid turnover protects 
the organism from harmful consequences, as wounded and 
sick cells are discarded. If an epithelial cell started to divide 
inappropriately as the result of a mutation, for example, 

it and its unwanted progeny would most often simply be 
discarded by natural disposal from the tip of a villus: even 
though such mutations must occur often, they rarely give 
rise to a cancer. 

A neuron, on the other hand, lives in a very protected 

environment, insulated from the outside world. Its function 
depends on a complex system of connections with other 
neurons—a system that is created during development and 
is not easy to reconstruct if the neuron subsequently dies.

Answer 20–8  Every cell division generates one 
additional cell; so if the cells were never lost or discarded 
from the body, the number of cells in the body should equal 
the number of divisions plus one. The number of divisions is 
1000-fold greater than the number of cells because, in the 
course of a lifetime, 1000 cells are discarded by mechanisms 
such as apoptosis for every cell that is retained in the body. 

Answer 20–9
A.  False. Gap junctions are not connected to the 
cytoskeleton; their role is to provide cell–cell 
communication by allowing small molecules to pass from 
one cell to another. 

B.  True. Upon wilting, the turgor pressure in the plant cell is 

reduced, and consequently the cell walls, having tensile 
but little compressive strength, like a rubber tire, no 
longer provide rigidity. 

C.  False. Proteoglycans can withstand a large amount of 

compressive force but do not have a rigid structure. 
Their space-filling properties result from their tendency 
to absorb large amounts of water. 

D.  True. 
E.  True. 
F.  True. Stem cells stably express control genes that ensure 

that their daughter cells will be of the appropriate 
differentiated cell types. 

Answer 20–10 Small cytosolic molecules, such as glutamic 
acid, cyclic AMP, and Ca2+ ions, pass readily through both 
gap junctions and plasmodesmata, whereas large cytosolic 
macromolecules, such as mRNA and G proteins, are 
excluded. Plasma membrane phospholipids diffuse in the 
plane of the membrane through plasmodesmata because 
the plasma membranes of adjacent cells are continuous 
through these junctions. This traffic is not possible through 
gap junctions, because the membranes of the connected 
cells remain separate. 

Answer 20–11 Plants are exposed to extreme changes 
in the environment, which often are accompanied by huge 
fluctuations in the osmotic properties of their surroundings. 
An intermediate filament network as we know it from animal 
cells would not be able to provide full osmotic support for 
cells: the sparse, rivetlike attachment points would not be 
able to prevent the membrane from bursting in response to 
a huge osmotic pressure applied from the inside of the cell.

Answer 20–12 Action potentials can, in fact, be passed 
from cell to cell through gap junctions. Indeed, heart muscle 
cells are connected in this way, which ensures that they 
contract synchronously when stimulated. This mechanism of 
passing the signal from cell to cell is rather limited, however. 
As we discuss in Chapter 12, synapses are far more 
sophisticated and allow signals to be modulated and to be 
integrated with other signals received by the cell. Thus, gap 
junctions are like simple soldered joints between electrical 

Answer 20–17 During exposure to the carcinogen, 
mutations are induced, but the number of relevant 
mutations in any one cell is usually not enough to convert 
it directly into a cancer cell. Over the years, the cells that 
have become predisposed to cancer through the induced 
mutations accumulate progressively more mutations. 
Eventually, one of them will turn into a cancer cell. The long 
delay between exposure and cancer has made it extremely 
difficult to hold cigarette manufacturers or producers of 
industrial carcinogens legally responsible for the damage 
that is caused by their products.

Answer 20–18 By definition, a carcinogen is any 
substance that promotes the occurrence of one or more 
types of cancer. The sex hormones can therefore be 
classified as naturally occurring carcinogens. Although 
most carcinogens act by directly causing mutations, 
carcinogenic effects are also often exerted in other ways. 
The sex hormones increase both the rate of cell division and 
the numbers of cells in hormone-sensitive organs such as 
breast, uterus, and prostate. The first effect increases the 
mutation rate per cell, because mutations, regardless of 
environmental factors, are spontaneously generated in the 
course of DNA replication and chromosome segregation; 
the second effect increases the number of cells at risk. In 
these and possibly other ways, the hormones can favor the 
development of cancer, even though they do not directly 
cause mutations.

Answer 20–19 The short answer is no—cancer in 
general is not a hereditary disease. It arises from new 
mutations occurring in our own somatic cells, rather than 
mutations we inherit from our parents. In some rare types 
of cancer, however, there is a strong heritable risk factor, 
so that parents and their children both show the same 
predisposition to a specific form of the disease. This occurs, 
for example, in families carrying a mutation that knocks 
out one of the two copies of the tumor suppressor gene 
APC; the children then inherit a propensity to colorectal 
cancer. Much weaker heritable tendencies are also seen in 
several other cancers, including breast cancer, but the genes 
responsible for these effects are still mostly unknown.

Answer 20–13 To make jello, gelatin is boiled in water, 
which denatures the collagen fibers. Upon cooling, the 
disordered fibers form a tangled mess that solidifies into a 
gel. This gel actually resembles the collagen as it is initially 
secreted by fibroblasts. It is not until the fibers have been 
aligned, bundled, and cross-linked that they acquire their 
ability to resist tensile forces.

Answer 20–14 The evidence that DNA is the blueprint 
that specifies all the structural characteristics of an organism 
is based on observations that small changes in the DNA 
by mutation result in changes in the organism. Although 
DNA provides the plans that specify structure, these plans 
need to be executed during development. This requires 
a suitable environment (a human baby would not fit into 
a stork’s egg shell), suitable nourishment, suitable tools 
(such as the appropriate transcription regulators required 
for early development), suitable spatial organization 
(such as the asymmetries in the egg cell required to allow 
for appropriate cell differentiation during the early cell 
divisions), and so on. Thus inheritance is not restricted 
to the passing on of the organism’s DNA, because 
development requires appropriate conditions to be set 
up by the parent. Nevertheless, when all these conditions 
are met, the plans that are archived in the genome will 
determine the structure of the organism to be built.

Answer 20–15 White blood cells circulate in the 
bloodstream and migrate into and out of tissues in 
performance of their normal function of defending the 
body against infection: they are naturally invasive. Once 
mutations have occurred to upset the normal controls on 
production of these cells, there is no need for additional 
mutations to enable the cells to spread through the body. 
Thus, the number of mutations that have to be accumulated 
in order to give rise to leukemia is smaller than for other 
types of cancer.

Answer 20–16 The shape of the curve reflects the need 
for multiple mutations to accumulate in a cell before a 
cancer results. If a single mutation were sufficient, the 
graph would be a straight horizontal line: the likelihood of 
occurrence of a particular mutation, and therefore of cancer, 
would be the same at any age. If two specific mutations 
were required, the graph would be a straight line sloping 
upward from the origin: the second mutation has an equal 
chance of occurring at any time, but will tip the cell into 
cancerous behavior only if the first mutation has already 
occurred in the same cell lineage; and the likelihood that the 
first mutation has already occurred will be proportional to 
the age of the individual. The steeply curved graph shown 
in the figure goes up approximately as the fifth power of 
the age, and this indicates that far more than two mutations 
have to be accumulated before cancer sets in. It is not easy 
to say precisely how many, because of the complex ways 
in which cancers develop. Successive mutations can alter 
cell numbers and cell behavior, and thereby change both 
the probability of subsequent mutations and the selection 
pressures that drive the evolution of cancer.

Typical  non-mutant  form  of  a  species,  gene,  or 
characteristic as it occurs in nature.

Wnt protein

Member of a family of extracellular signal molecules 
that regulates cell proliferation and migration during 
embryonic  development  and  that  maintains  stem 
cells in a proliferative state. 

X chromosome

Larger  of  the  two  sex  chromosomes  in  mammals. 
The cells of males contain one, and females possess 
two. 

X-ray crystallography

Technique used to determine the three-dimensional 
structure  of  a  protein  molecule  by  analyzing  the 
pattern produced when a beam of X-rays is passed 
through an ordered array of the protein.

GLOSSARY

Y chromosome

Smaller of the two sex chromosomes of mammals. 
Present  in  a  single  copy  only  in  the  cells  of  males, 
contains genes that direct the development of male 
sex organs and characteristics.

yeast

Common  term  for  several  families  of  eukaryotic 
unicellular fungi used as model organisms. Includes 
species used for brewing beer and making bread, as 
well as species that cause disease.  

zygote

Diploid  cell  produced  by  fusion  of  a  male  and  a 
female gamete. A fertilized egg.
