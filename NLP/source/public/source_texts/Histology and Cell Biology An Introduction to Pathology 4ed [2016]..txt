PREFACE
The fourth edition of Histology and Cell Biology: An Introduction to Pathology contains revi-
sions and additions that strengthen the visual approach to learning histology within the 
context of cell biology and pathology introduced in the previous editions. New in the fourth 
edition are a greater emphasis on pathology topics and the online audiovisual version of the 
histology-oriented Concept Mappings. The combined histology–cell biology–pathology 
approach intends to prepare medical students for the forthcoming learning of pathophysiol-
ogy and clinical medicine. The practice of medicine changes relentlessly as new knowledge 
becomes known. Future physicians can ﬁnd in this book the basis for continuing education 
to better help their patients by constantly integrating basic and clinical sciences. 

   The visual approach presented in this book emerged from many years of practicing pathol-
ogy and teaching cell biology, histology, and pathology to medical students. Through the 
years, it became clear the need to communicate and reinforce relevant concepts of histol-
ogy and pathology to be mastered under increasing time constraints resulting from changes 
in the basic science curriculum in most medical schools.  The focal point of the teaching 
approach is to provide medical students with an integrated method wherein the learning of 
normal structure and pathologic conditions can reinforce each other. The cell biology and 
pathology components, although not complete, provide the necessary foundation for further 
learning and integration with medical sciences. Pathology students and residents may ﬁnd 
this book useful for refreshing basic concepts of histology and cell biology. Histology and pa-
thology are visually oriented sciences, and the visual cues included in this book can facilitate 
interpretation opportunities in clinical practice.  

   Similar to the previous editions, the fourth edition consists of six parts.  Part I brings 
together histology, cell biology, and general pathology within the context of the basic tissues. 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling, is an uncommon section in a histology book. It serves to unify 
the concept that the study of tissues and organs cannot be separated from molecular biology 
and general pathology.  Parts II through VI present several organ systems grouped by their 
most relevant function for the purpose of integration. Instructors and students may ﬁnd the 
grouping of organs useful for teaching and learning. Teachers may ﬁnd the material beneﬁ-
cial for delivering a lecture using the same or a different presentation sequence. In Part VI, 
Organ Systems: The Reproductive System, the chapter headings depart from the traditional 
designation to emphasize prominent functions. All the information is presented in a clear, 
concise, and student-friendly manner using color graphics and photographs that are meant 
to be studied. In some cases the graphics reiterate the concise text; in others they add new 
information complementing or extending the text. Several boxes dispersed in most of the 
chapters introduce students to clinical and pathologic conditions based on recent and evolv-
ing molecular and biochemical knowledge. 

   Most chapters include one or more Concept Mappings. Each Concept Mapping provides 
a basic framework of interconnected concepts arranged in a hierarchical form leading to 
integration and critical thinking. Concept Mapping and Essential Concepts highlight key 
issues to remember, correlate, and extend in forthcoming courses during medical education. 
Students may ﬁnd the new online audiovisual version of Concept Mappings  convenient for 
reviewing and integrating the material when the time of in-course and board examinations 
arrives. 

   There are many people to be acknowledged and thanked. We are grateful for the numer-
ous suggestions, comments, and encouragements from faculty and students.  All of them 
provided valuable feedback to make the message clearer and more consistent.  We also thank 
publishers who made available to students the Chinese, French, Greek, Japanese, Portuguese, 
Spanish, and Turkish editions. Our special appreciation goes to the production team of Else-
vier in the Philadelphia and St. Louis ofﬁces for their magniﬁcent effort in making sure that 
the fourth edition met high publishing standards.

PART I    BASIC TISSUES | INTEGRATED CELL BIOLOGY AND GENERAL PATHOLOGY

1. Epithelium

Epithelia separate the internal environment from the external environment by forming sheets of polarized cells 
held together by specialized junctional complexes and cell adhesion molecules. Epithelial cells participate in 
embryo morphogenesis and organ development in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signaling by tailoring cell 
proliferation, differentiation and cell death. We address the structural characteristics of epithelial cells within a 
biochemical and molecular framework as an introduction to the transition from a normal to a pathologic status.

General classiﬁcation of epithelia  
The epithelium is a tightly cohesive sheet of cells 
that  covers  or  lines  body  surfaces  (for  example, 
skin,  intestine,  secretory  ducts)  and  forms  the 
functional units of secretory glands (for example, 
salivary glands, liver).  The main characteristics of 
epithelia are summarized in Box 1-A. 

The  traditional  classiﬁcation  and  nomenclature 
of different types of epithelia are based on two pa-
rameters: 

1. The shapes of individual cells.
2. The arrangement of the cells in one or more 

layers (Figure 1-1). 

Individual epithelial cells can be ﬂattened (squa-
mous cells), have equal dimensions (cuboidal cells), 
and be taller than wider (columnar cells).

According to the number of cell layers, an epithe-
lium consisting of a single cell layer is classiﬁed as 
simple epithelium. 

Simple  epithelia,  in  turn,  are  subdivided  into 

simple squamous epithelium, simple cuboidal epi-
thelium, and simple columnar epithelium, according 
to the shape of their cell components. The speciﬁc 
name endothelium is used for the simple squamous 
epithelium lining the blood and lymphatic vessels. 
Mesothelium  is  the  simple  squamous  epithelium 
lining  all  body  cavities  (peritoneum,  pericardium, 
and pleura). Figure 1-2 provides examples of simple 
epithelia. 

Stratiﬁed  epithelia  are  composed  of  more  than 
one  cell  layer.  Stratiﬁed  epithelia  are  subclassiﬁed 
according to the shapes of the cells at the superﬁcial 
or outer layer into stratiﬁed squamous epithelium, 
stratiﬁed cuboidal epithelium, and stratiﬁed colum-
nar epithelium. 

Stratiﬁed  squamous  is  the  epithelium  most  fre-
quently found and can be subdivided into moderately 
keratinized (also known as nonkeratinizing) or highly 
keratinized types (Figure 1-3). The cells of the outer 
layer of a nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium retain

 Box 1-A | Main characteristics of epithelia

•  Epithelia derive from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
•  Epithelia line and cover all body surfaces except the articular cartilage, the 
enamel of the tooth, and the anterior surface of the iris.
•  The basic functions of epithelia are protection (skin), absorption (small and 
large intestine), transport of material at the surface (mediated by cilia), secre-
tion (glands), excretion (tubules of the kidneys), gas exchange (lung alveolus), 
and gliding between surfaces (mesothelium).
•  Most epithelial cells renew continuously by mitosis.
•  Epithelia lack a direct blood and lymphatic supply.  Nutrients are delivered by 
diffusion.
• Epithelial cells have almost no free intercellular substances (in contrast to con-
nective tissue).
•  The cohesive nature of an epithelium is maintained by cell adhesion mol-
ecules and junctional complexes.
•  Epithelia are anchored to a basal lamina. The basal lamina and connective 
tissue components cooperate to form the basement membrane.
•  Epithelia have structural and functional polarity.

nuclei (for example, esophagus and vagina). Nuclei 
are absent in the outer layer of the highly keratin-
ized stratiﬁed squamous epithelium (for example, 
the epidermis of the skin). Stratiﬁed epithelia have 
basal cells aligned along the basal lamina. Basal cells 
are mitotically active and continuously replace the 
differentiating cells of the upper layers.

Although rare, there are also stratiﬁed cuboidal 
epithelia (for example, in the ovarian follicles) and 
stratiﬁed cuboidal epithelia (for example, lining the 
intralobular ducts of salivary glands). 

Two  special  categories  are  the  pseudostratiﬁed 
epithelium and the urothelium. The pseudostrati-
ﬁed epithelium consists of basal and columnar cells 
resting on the basal lamina. Only the columnar cells 
reach the luminal surface. Because the nuclei of the 
basal and columnar cells are seen at different levels, 
one has the impression of a stratiﬁed epithelial or-
ganization. 

Within  this  category  are  the  pseudostratified 
columnar ciliated epithelium of the trachea and the 
pseudostratiﬁed columnar epithelium with stereo-
cilia of the epididymis (Figure 1-4). 

The epithelium of the human urinary passages, also 
referred to as urothelium, has the characteristics of a 
pseudostratiﬁed epithelium: it consists of basal cells, 
intermediate cells and columnar dome-shaped cells, 
each extending thin cytoplasmic processes reaching 
the basal lamina (Figure 1-4). An important feature 
of  this epithelium is its transitional height that var-
ies with distention and contraction of the organ (see 
Chapter 14, Urinary System).

Epithelial cell polarity
An important aspect of an epithelium is its polarity. 
Polarity is essential to carry out speciﬁc functions of 
the various organ systems. Polarity is determined by 

the distribution of proteins and lipids and the rear-
rangement of the cytoskeleton.

Most epithelial cells lining surfaces and cavities and 

have three geometric domains (Figure 1-5):

1. The apical (uppermost) domain is exposed to 
the lumen or external environment and displays apical 
differentiations.

2. The lateral domain faces neighboring epithelial 
cells linked to each other by cell adhesion molecules 
and junctional complexes. 

3. The  basal  domain  is  associated  with  a  basal 
lamina that separates the epithelium from underlying 
connective tissue, representing the internal environ-
ment. The basal lamina, of epithelial cell origin, is 
reinforced by components of the connective tissue. 
The basal lamina–connective tissue complex is des-
ignated the basement membrane. 

From the functional perspective, sealing junctions 
segregate the plasma membrane of an epithelial cell  
into an apical domain and a basolateral domain. This 
segregation is supported by the asymmetric distribu-
tion  of  transporting  molecules  ensuring  polarized 
secretory and absorptive functions of an epithelium.
For  example,  the  apical  domain  has  structures 
important  for  the  protection  of  the  epithelial  sur-
face (such as cilia in the respiratory tract)  or for the 
absorption of substances (such as microvilli  in the 
intestinal  epithelium).  In  contrast,  the  basolateral 
domain facilitates directional or vectorial transport 
functions  prevented  from  trespassing  the  sealing 
junctions. 

Apical differentiations
The apical domain of some epithelial cells can display 
three types of differentiation: 

1. Cilia.  
2. Microvilli.  
3. Stereocilia.

Cilia
There are two types of cilia (singular, cilium; Figure 
1-6): multiple motile cilia and a single or a primary 
non-motile cilium. 

Ciliogenesis, the assembly process of both types 
of  cilia,  is  initiated  by  the  basal  body,  a  structure 
originated  from  a  basal  body  precursor  located  in 
the  centrosome. The  basal  body  precursor  multi-
plies  and  undergoes  differentiation  under  control 
of  six  small,  non-protein  coding  microRNAs  that 
inhibit the translation of the mRNA encoding the 
centrosomal  protein  CP110.  If  the  expression  of 
CP110 protein increases by deletion of the regulatory 
microRNAs, basal bodies fail to dock to the apical 
plasma membrane, disrupting ciliogenesis and giv-
ing rise to human respiratory disease and primary 
ciliary dyskinesia.

Microvilli participate in the absorption of proteins, sugar, and lipids, 
which are released at the basolateral domain into the blood 

circulation for transport to the liver.
Goblet cells are present among the columnar epithelial cells.  They 
can be distinguished by a dilated, goblet-like apical cytoplasm 
containing a light-stained mucus material. Mucus is released into 
the lumen and coats the epithelial cell surface. The lamina propria  
consists of loose connective tissue located beneath the epithelium.

tissue from the mechanical action of ingested food. The 
outermost cells retain their nuclei. This epithelium is also

This highly keratinized epithelium also consists of basal cells

abundant keratin to prevent water loss and penetration of chemical 
and physical insults. The outermost cells lack nuclei. This 
epithelium is also known as keratinizing.

Under  normal  conditions,  basal  bodies  migrate 
to  the  apical  plasma  membrane  and  extend  into 
the extracellular space the axoneme, a microtubular 
structure that forms the basic structure of the cilium.  

Multiple motile cilia
Multiple motile cilia function to coordinate ﬂuid or 
cargo ﬂow on the surface of an epithelium. They 
are  cell  projections  originating  from  basal  bodies 
anchored  by  rootlets  to  the  apical  portion  of  the 
cytoplasm (Figure 1-6). 

A basal body contains nine triplet microtubules in 

a helicoid array without a central microtubular com-
ponent. By contrast, a cilium consists of an axoneme 
formed by a central pair of microtubules surrounded 
by nine concentrically arranged microtubular pairs. 
This assembly is known as the  9 + 2  microtubular 
doublet arrangement. The axoneme is also a com-
ponent of the sperm tail, or ﬂagellum. 

The trachea and the oviduct are lined by ciliated 
epithelial cells. In these epithelia, ciliary activity is 
important  for  the  local  defense  of  the  respiratory 
system and for the transport of the fertilized egg to 
the uterine cavity.

of them extending cytoplasmic processes anchored to the basal

characteristic of the urothelium is its transitional configuration in 
response to distension and contraction tensional forces caused by 
urine. Plaques of aggregated proteins (uroplakins) are found on the 
apical plasma membrane of the dome-shaped superficial cells.

Single or primary non-motile cilium
Some cells have a single or primary non-motile cili-
um. The importance of a single cilium emerges from 
rare recessive human disorders known as ciliopathies 
caused by structural  or functional abnormalities of 
cilia. The structure and mechanism of assembly of a 
single cilium are shown in Figure 1-6. 

The signiﬁcant aspects of a primary cilium are: 
1. It functions as a sensor that provides the cell 
with  information  about  the  surrounding  external 
environment.

2. It participates in the early stages of embryonic 

patterning leading to organogenesis.

3. Many components of the hedgehog signaling 
pathway, essential at least in early development, are 
present in a single cilium.

4. The position of the single cilium, called kino-
cilium, of the hair cell of the organ of Corti in the in-
ner ear determines the correct polarity of the adjacent 
actin-containing stereocilia, essential for maintaining 
body balance and for hearing (see Chapter 9, Sensory  
Organs: Vision and Hearing).

Microvilli
Microvilli  (singular,  microvillus;  Figure  1-7)  are 
ﬁnger-like cell projections of the apical epithelial cell 
surface containing a core of cross-linked microﬁla-
ments (a polymer of G-actin monomers). 

At the cytoplasmic end of the microvillus, bundles 
of actin and other proteins extend into the terminal 
web, a ﬁlamentous network of cytoskeletal proteins 
running parallel to the apical domain of the epithe-
lial cell. 

The  intestinal  epithelium  and  portions  of  the 
nephron in the kidney are lined by epithelial cells with 
microvilli forming a brush border. In general, a brush 
border indicates the absorptive function of the cell.

Epithelial cell polarity

Stereocilia (stereovilli)
Stereocilia  (singular,  stereocilium;  see  Figure  1-7) 
are long and branching ﬁnger-like projections of the 
apical  epithelial  cell  surface.  Similar  to  microvilli, 
stereocilia contain a core of cross-linked actin with 
other proteins. Stereocilia (or stereovilli) do not have 
axonemes.  Stereocilia/stereovilli are typical of the epi-
thelial lining of the epididymis and contribute to the 
process of sperm maturation occurring in this organ.

Cell adhesion molecules 
A sheet of epithelial cells results from the tight attach-
ment of similar cells to each other and to the basal 
lamina, a component of the extracellular matrix. Cell 
adhesion molecules enable interepithelial cell contact, 
and this contact is stabilized by specialized cell junc-
tions. A consequence of this arrangement is the apical 
and basolateral domain polarity of an epithelial sheet. 
Although cell adhesion molecules and cell junctions 
are considered here within the framework of epithelia, 
nonepithelial cells also can use cell adhesion molecules 
and junctions to establish contact with each other, en-
abling cell-cell communication. A typical example of 
nonepithelial cells connected by specialized junctions 
is the cardiac muscle (see Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue).
There are two major groups of cell adhesion mol-

ecules (see Box 1-B): 

1. Ca2+-dependent molecules, including cadherins 

and selectins. 

2. Ca2+-independent molecules, which compose 

the immunoglobulin superfamily and integrins. 
      Many  cells  can  use  different  cell  adhesion  mol-
ecules to mediate cell-cell attachment. Integrins are 
mainly involved in cell–extracellular matrix interac-
tions.  Cadherins  and  integrins  establish  a  link  be-
tween the internal cytoskeleton of a cell and the ex-
terior of another cell (cadherins) or the extracellular 
matrix (integrins).

Cadherins
Cadherins (Figure 1-8) are a family of  Ca2+-depen-
dent molecules with a major role in cell adhesion and 
morphogenesis. 

The importance of cadherins in human disease 
is  indicated  by  the  process  known  as  epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT).  EMT is the switch-
ing of polarized epithelial cells to a ﬁbroblast-like or 
mesenchymal phenotype characterized by the loss of 
intercellular adhesion and increased cell migration. 
During EMT, epithelial cadherins (E-cadherins), 
Crumbs  (a  group  of  apical  polarity  proteins)  and 
cytokeratins  (a  cytoskeletal  intermediate  ﬁlament 
protein)  are  downregulated,  whereas  mesenchymal 
markers,  such  as  vimentin  (another  intermediate 
ﬁlament protein), are upregulated. 

A loss of E-cadherins is associated with the acquisi-

Cilia develop from basal bodies located in the apical domain of the cytoplasm. Basal 
body precursors derive from the centrosome, multiply, mature and dock to the apical 
plasma membrane of the cell. A basal body, consisting of nine peripheral 
microtubule triplets (93 [triplets] + 0) in a helicoidal arrangement, extends into the 
extracellular space an axoneme, a microtubular structure surrounded by the plasma 
membrane.  Rootlets anchor the basal body to the cytoplasm. Central microtubules 
are not present in basal bodies and centrioles. The cilium consists of a concentric 
array of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of microtubules (92 
[doublets] + 2).

Assembly of the cilium

The cilium is formed and maintained by the transport of tubulins along the axoneme 
mediated by proteins of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. IFT trafficking from 
the base of the cilium to the tip (anterograde transport; to the microtubule plus end) 
is mediated by kinesin motor proteins mobilizing IFT protein complexes.  Dynein 
motor participates in retrograde transport (to the microtubule minus end; base of the 
cilium).  IFT proteins form a platform for transporting cargo between the base and tip 
of the cilium. 
    Disruption of the kinesin motor or IFT proteins blocks cilia formation. Basal body 
proteins influence ciliary trafficking. Among these are components of the BBSome, 
which are named after their association with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). 
BBSome proteins may help loading protein cargo to the ciliary axoneme. 
    Proteins of the hedgehog signaling pathway participate in intraciliary and 
intraflagellar transport.  

Primary cilium and Hedgehog signaling

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling requires primary cilia for activation. The trafficking of Hh 
pathway proteins along primary cilia is a key factor in epithelial cell differentiation. 
     In the absence of Hh secretory protein, Ptc (for patched; the receptor of Hh),  
1
the transmembrane protein Smo (for Smoothened) is blocked from entering the 
cilium. Smo is stored in vesicles near the basal body. 
     Upon Hh binding, Ptc is internalized and Smo, free from blocking, moves to 
2
the plasma membrane       and activates the Hh pathway by antagonizing the 
function of Sufu (suppressor of fused)       .
     The motor kinesin KIF7 transports Gli (for glioma) transcription factors to the 
5
tip of the cilium. If Smo is not available to inactivate Sufu (because of the absence 
of Hh), Gli is degraded or processed to become a repressor. If the suppressive 
function of Sufu is antagonized, Gli is processed to an activator form (GliA)      . 
6
     Activated GliA is then transported out of the cilium into the nucleus (by dynein 
7
motor and IFT proteins) to activate epithelial differentiation genes.

tion of invasive behavior by tumor cells (metastasis) 
as we discuss in Chapter 4, Connective Tissue and 
Chapter 17, Digestive Glands.

 There are more than 40 different cadherins. E-
cadherin is found along the lateral cell surfaces and 
is responsible for the maintenance of most epithelial 
layers. The removal of calcium or the use of a block-
ing antibody to E-cadherin in epithelial cell cultures 
breaks down cell-cell attachment, and the formation 
of stabilizing junctions is disrupted.  E-cadherin mol-
ecules form cis-homophilic dimers (“like-to-like”),  
which bind to dimers of the same or different class 
of cadherins in the opposite cell membrane (trans-
homophilic or heterophilic [“like-to-unlike”] interac-
tion). These forms of binding require the presence of 
calcium and result in a specialized  zipper-like cell-cell 
adhesion pattern.

N-cadherin is found in the central nervous system, 

the lens of the eye, and in skeletal and cardiac muscle.  
P-cadherin is observed in placenta (trophoblast).

The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins is linked to 
actin through intermediate proteins known collec-
tively as the catenin (Latin catena, chain) complex.  
The  complex  includes  catenins  ((cid:95)(cid:11)(cid:3) (cid:96)(cid:11)(cid:3) and  p120) 
and actin-binding proteins ((cid:95)-actinin, vinculin, and 
formin-1, among others). 

The catenin complex has at least three distinct roles 

in the function of cadherins: 

1. Catenins mediate a direct link to ﬁlamentous 

actin.

2. They interact with regulatory molecules of the 

actin cytoskeleton.

3. They control the adhesive state of the extracel-

lular domain of cadherins. 

The  association  of  actin  to  the  cadherin-catenin 
complex is essential for cell morphogenesis, changes

Members of the cadherin family also are present 
between cytoplasmic plaques of the zonula and the 
macula adherens. (cid:96)-catenin plays a signiﬁcant role 
in colorectal carcinogenesis (see Chapter 16, Lower 
Digestive Segment).

Selectins
Selectins  (Figure  1-9),  similar  to  cadherins,  are 
Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecules. In contrast 
to  cadherins,  selectins  bind  to  carbohydrates  and 
belong to the family of C-type lectins (Latin lectum, 
to select). 

Each  selectin  has  a  carbohydrate-recognition 
domain  (CRD)  with  binding  afﬁnity  to  a  speciﬁc 
oligosaccharide attached to a protein (glycoprotein) 

 Box 1-B | Cell adhesion molecules: Highlights to remember

• Cell adhesion molecules can be classiﬁed as  Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-
independent.  
• Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules include cadherins and selectins.
• Ca2+-independent adhesion molecules include cell adhesion molecules of the 
immunoglobulin superfamily (CAMs) and integrins.
• Cadherins and CAMs display trans-homophilic interaction across the intercel-
lular space.
• Integrins are the only cell adhesion molecules consisting of two subunits: (cid:95) and 
(cid:96).
• Cadherins and integrins interact with F-actin through adapters (catenins for 
cadherins, and vinculin, talin, and (cid:95)-actinin for integrins).

or a lipid (glycolipid). The molecular conﬁguration 
of the CRD is controlled by calcium.  

Selectins participate in the movement of  leuko-
cytes (Greek leukos, white, kytos, cell) circulating in 
blood (neutrophils, monocytes, B and T cells) toward 
tissues by extravasation. Extravasation is the essence 
of  homing, a mechanism that enables leukocytes to 
escape from blood circulation and reach the sites of 
inﬂammation (see Figure 1-12). Homing also permits 
thymus-derived T  cells  to  home  in  on  peripheral 
lymph nodes  (see Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic 
System).

The  three  major  classes  of    cell  surface  selectins 

are as follows: 

1.  P-selectin,  found  in  platelets  and  activated 

endothelial cells lining blood vessels. 

2. E-selectin, found on activated endothelial cells.
3. L-selectin, found on leukocytes.
P-selectin is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles in en-
dothelial cells. When endothelial cells are activated 
by inﬂammatory signaling, P-selectin appears on the 
cell surface. 

On their surface, leukocytes contain sialyl Lewis-
x  antigen,  a  speciﬁc  oligosaccharide  ligand  for  P-
selectin. P-selectin binding to the antigen slows down 
streaming leukocytes in blood, and they begin to roll 
along the endothelial cell surfaces. P-selectins get ad-
ditional help from members of the immunoglobulin 
(Ig) superfamily and integrins to stabilize leukocyte 
attachment, leading to extravasation (see Figure 1-12).

Ig superfamily
N-CAM (for neural cell adhesion molecule) belongs 
to the Ig superfamily and mediates homophilic and 
heterophilic interactions. 

In contrast to cadherins and selectins, members of 
the Ig superfamily are Ca2+-independent cell adhesion 
molecules and are encoded by a single gene. Members 
of the Ig superfamily are generated by the alternative 
messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and have differ-
ences in glycosylation. 

A conserved feature shared by all members of the 
Ig superfamily is an extracellular segment with one 
or more folded domains characteristic of immuno-
globulins (Figure 1-10). 

Of  particular  interest  is  CD4,  a  member  of  the 
Ig superfamily and the receptor for the human im-
munodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in a subclass 
of lymphocytes known as T cells or helper cells. We 
discuss  the  signiﬁcance  of  several  members  of  the 
Ig superfamily in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic 
System.

Other members of the Ig superfamily play impor-
tant roles in the homing process during inﬂammation. 
Examples include intercellular adhesion molecules 
1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) on endothelial cell

(EGF-like). 
3. Many consensus repeats found in complement regulatory proteins.
    There are three major types of selectins: 
1. L-selectin, carried by lymphocytes and with binding affinity to sulfated 
carbohydrates. 
2. E-selectin, expressed by activated endothelial cells. 
3. P-selectin, expressed by platelets and activated endothelial cells.
    Selectins, together with integrins and intercellular cell adhesion molecules 
(ICAMs), play a significant role in inflammation and in the periodic migration of 
lymphocytes from the circulation into lymphoid organs (homing).

surfaces. ICAM-1 is expressed when an inﬂamma-
tion is in progress to facilitate the transendothelial 
migration of leukocytes (see Chapter 6, Blood and 
Hematopoiesis).

Integrins
Integrins  (Figure  1-11)  differ  from  cadherins,  se-
lectins, and members of the Ig superfamily in that 
integrins are heterodimers formed by two associated 
(cid:95) and (cid:96)(cid:3)subunits encoded by different genes. There 
are about 22 integrin heterodimers consisting of 17 
forms of  (cid:95) subunits and 8 forms of (cid:96) subunits.

Almost every cell expresses one or several integrins. 
Similar to cadherins, the cytoplasmic domain of  (cid:96) 
integrin subunit is linked to actin ﬁlaments through 
connecting proteins (see Figure 1-11). 

The  extracellular  domain  of  (cid:96)  integrin  subunit 
binds to the tripeptide RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence 
present in laminin and ﬁbronectin, two major com-
ponents of the basement membrane, a speciﬁc type 
of  extracellular  matrix.  Laminin  and  ﬁbronectin 
interact with various collagen types (including type 
IV collagen), heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, 
and entactin (also called nidogen).

The  integrin–extracellular  matrix  relationship  is 
critical for cell migration to precise sites during em-
bryogenesis and can be regulated when cell motility 
is required.  In addition to their role in cell-matrix in-
teractions, integrins also mediate  cell-cell interaction. 
Integrins containing (cid:96)(cid:16) subunits are expressed on 
the surface of leukocytes and mediate cell-cell binding 
in preparation for extravasation. An example is (cid:95)(cid:15)(cid:96)(cid:16)(cid:3)
integrin on non-adherent leukocytes that bind to li-
gands on endothelial cell surfaces following activation 
by  extracellular  stimulation,  resulting  in  leukocyte 
extravasation  during  homing  (the  recruitment  of 
leukocytes  to  extravascular  spaces). We  discuss  the 
mechanism of cell homing in Figure 1-12 and expand 
it within the context of inﬂammation in Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System.   

Integrins  are  bidirectional  signaling  receptors.  
Integrins  can  be  activated  by  proteins  binding  to 
their extracellular and intracellular domains. When 
integrins  bind  to  extracellular  matrix  molecules,  a 
protein complex binds to the cytoskeleton and several 
signaling pathways are activated. 

Genetic mutations of integrins or integrin regula-
tors have been associated with Glanzmann’s thrombo-
asthenia (mutations in (cid:96)3 integrin subunit), leukocyte 
adhesion deﬁciency (type I, caused by mutations in (cid:96)2 
integrin subunit; type II, resulting from the absence 
of fucosyl-containing ligands for selectins due to a 
hereditary defect of endogenous fucose metabolism; 
and type III, determined by mutations in kindlin) 
and skin diseases (mutations in kindlin, (cid:95)2, (cid:95)6, and 
(cid:96)4 integrin subunits).   

Integrin, a bidirectional signaling receptor

Integrins differ from the other cell adhesion proteins: 
1. They consist of two subunits. 
2. They have a dual function: they bind to the 
extracellular matrix and the internal cytoskeleton. 
   The (cid:95) subunit of an integrin has two chains linked by 
a disulfide linkage and a globular head with binding 
sites for divalent cations.
   The (cid:96) subunit  has two significant characteristics: (1) 
The extracellular chain contains repeating cysteine-rich 
regions. (2) The intracellular portion interacts with actin 
filaments through connecting proteins: talin and focal 
adhesion kinase, the first proteins to be recruited. 
   In its active conformation, talin binds the (cid:96)-integrin 
cytoplasmic domain. Kindlin, an integrin coactivator, 
binds to the (cid:96)-integrin cytoplasmic domain and 
increases talin-induced integrin activation. The IPP 
complex (consisting of intergrin-linked kinase, PINCH 
[for Particularly Interesting New Cysteine-Histidine-rich 
protein] and parvin) recruits (cid:95)-actinin and paxillin to 
the cell adhesion site.  
   In its active conformation state, (cid:96)-integrin connects  
actin to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and 
laminin, through their RGD-binding sites.

ADAM proteins
The  reversal  of  integrin-mediated  cell  binding  to 
the extracellular matrix can be disrupted by proteins 
called ADAM (for a disintegrin and metalloprotease). 
ADAMs have pivotal roles in fertilization, angiogen-
esis,  neurogenesis,  heart  development,  cancer  and 
Alzheimer’s disease (see Chapter 8, Nervous Tissue). 
A typical ADAM protein (Figure 1-13) contains an 
extracellular domain and an intracellular domain. 
The extracellular domain consists of several portions 
including a disintegrin domain and a metallopro-
tease domain.  

1.  A  disintegrin  domain  binds  to  integrins  and 
competitively prevents integrin-mediated binding of 
cells to laminin, ﬁbronectin, and other extracellular 
matrix proteins. 

2.  A  metalloprotease  domain  degrades  matrix 

components and enables cell migration. 

A  significant  function  of  ADAMs  is  protein 
ectodomain shedding, consisting of the proteolytic 
release  of  the  ectodomain  of  a  membrane  protein 
cleaved adjacent to the plasma membrane. ADAMs 
are members of the family of sheddases.

Ectodomain shedding targets for cleavage the pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor   ligand 
(TNFL)  and  all  ligands  of  the  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptor.  A  released  soluble  ectodomain  of 
a cytokine or growth factor can function at a dis-
tance from the site of cleavage (paracrine signaling). 
Ectodomain  shedding  of  a  receptor  can  inactivate 

the receptor by functioning as a decoy sequestering 
soluble  ligands  away  from  the  plasma  membrane-
bound unoccupied receptor. 

A defect in TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) shedding, 
determined by a mutation in the receptor cleavage 
site, causes a periodic febrile  because of continuous 
availability of   TNFR1 for TNFL binding. Conse-
quently, recurring fever occurs by increased inﬂam-
matory responses.

Cell junctions
Although cell adhesion molecules are responsible for 
cell-cell adhesion, cell junctions are necessary for pro-
viding stronger stability. In addition, the movement of 
solutes, ions, and water through an epithelial layer oc-
curs across and between individual cell components. 
The transcellular pathway is controlled by numer-

ous channels and transporters. 

The paracellular pathway is regulated by a con-
tinuous  intercellular  contact  or  cell  junctions.  A 
deﬁciency in the cell junctions accounts for acquired 
and inherited diseases caused by inefﬁcient epithelial 
barriers.
  Cell junctions are symmetrical structures formed 
between  two  adjacent  cells. There  are  three  major 
classes  of  symmetrical  cell  junctions  (Figure  1-14; 
see Box 1-C): 

1. Tight junctions. 
2. Anchoring junctions. 
3. Gap or communicating junctions.

3         Integrin receptors for endothelial 
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 ligands are 
rapidly activated on the leukocyte 
surface during rolling. Chemical 
mediators in the sites of inflammation 
stimulate the activation of integrins (cid:96)1 
and (cid:96)2. Integrins strengthen leukocyte 
binding to endothelial cell surfaces.

4
        Transendothelial 
migration is mediated 
by integrins interacting 
with ligands on 
endothelial cell 
surfaces. F-actin 
dynamics participate in 
this process.

Most leukocytes circulate in blood without interacting with other 
blood cells or endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.  However, a 
subset of lymphocytes participates in a continuous recirculation 
process through lymphoid tissues. This homing process involves 
many diverse adhesion molecules that help lymphocytes to home to 
various lymphoid compartments of the body.  

   The lymphocyte-endothelial cell interaction requires two types of 
cell adhesion proteins: selectins and integrins. Neutrophils use a 
similar mechanism to escape from blood vessels, primarily 
postcapillary venules, into inflammatory sites. The migration of 
leukocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue occurs in several steps 
as illustrated.

Tight junctions
Tight  junctions  (also  called  occluding  junctions) 
(Figure 1-15) have two major functions:  

1.  They  determine  epithelial  cell  polarity  by 
separating  the  apical  domain  from  the  basolateral 
domain and preventing the free diffusion of lipids 
and proteins between them.

2. They  prevent  the  free  passage  of  substances 
across an epithelial cell layer (paracellular pathway 
barrier). 

Cell  membranes  of  two  adjacent  cells  come  to-
gether at regular intervals to seal the apical intercel-
lular  space. These  areas  of  close  contact  continue 
around  the  entire  surface  of  the  cell  like  a  belt, 
forming anastomosing strips of the transmembrane 

proteins occludin and claudin. Occludin and claudin 
belong to the family of tetraspanins with four trans-
membrane domains, two outer loops, and two short 
cytoplasmic tails. 

 Occludin interacts with four major zonula occlu-
din (ZO) proteins: ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and afadin. 
Claudin  (Latin  claudere,  to  close),  a  family  of  16 
proteins forming linear ﬁbrils in the tight junctions, 
confers barrier properties on the paracellular pathway. 
A mutation in the gene encoding claudin 16 is the 
cause  of  a  rare  human  renal  magnesium  wasting 
syndrome  characterized  by  hypomagnesemia  and 
seizures.

Two members of the Ig superfamily, nectins and 
junctional  adhesion  molecules  (JAMs),  are  pres-

The metalloprotease degrades

participates in the cleavage of a 
membrane protein at the plasma 
membrane level, which results in the 
release of its soluble ectodomain. This 
process is known as ectodomain 
shedding. 
   Ectodomain shedding targets a 
number of molecules, including  the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor 
necrosis factor ligand and all 
epidermal growth factor receptor 
ligands.

Figure 1-13. ADAM protein, a sheddase

ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) proteins are 
membrane-anchored metalloproteases. The proteolytic activity of 
metalloproteases depends on a metal ion (Zn2+) for their activity.
   An ADAM protein has an extracellular domain that contains an N-terminal 
metalloprotease domain and a disintegrin domain.

could sequester a ligand.

ent in tight junctions. Both form homodimers (cis 
homodimers) and then trans homodimers across the 
intercellular  space.  Nectins  are  connected  to  actin 
ﬁlaments through the protein afadin. The targeted 
deletion of the afadin gene in mice results in em-
bryonic  lethality.  A  mutation  in  the  nectin-1  gene 
is  responsible  for  cleft  lip/palate  and  ectodermal 
dysplasia (CLEPD1) of skin, hairs, nails, and teeth 
in humans. Nectin-2–deﬁcient male mice are sterile.
 Tight junctions can be visualized by freeze-frac-
turing  a network of  branching and anastomosing 
sealing strands. We discuss in Chapter 2, Epithelial 
Glands,  the  procedure  of  freeze-fracturing  for  the 
study of cell membranes.

Anchoring junctions
Anchoring junctions are found below the tight junc-
tions, usually near the apical surface of an epithelium. 
There are three classes of anchoring junctions (see 
Figures 1-14, 1-16, 1-18, and 1-19): 

1. The zonula adherens or belt desmosome
2. The macula adherens or spot desmosome
3. The hemidesmosome 

Zonula adherens or belt desmosome
Similar to the tight junctions, the zonula adherens 
is a beltlike junction. The zonula adherens (Figure 
1-16) is associated with actin microﬁlaments. This as-
sociation is mediated  by the interaction of cadherins 
(desmocollins and desmogleins) with catenins ((cid:95)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:96)(cid:11)(cid:3)
and p120). The main desmogleins expressed in the 
epidermis of the skin are desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 
3 (Figure 1-17).

Macula adherens or spot desmosome
The macula adherens (also called desmosome) is a 
spotlike junction associated with keratin intermediate 
ﬁlaments (also known as tonoﬁlaments) extending 
from one spot to another on the lateral and basal cell 
surfaces of epithelial cells (Figure 1-18). Spot desmo-

somes provide strength and rigidity to an epithelial 
cell layer. Spot desmosomes are also present in the in-
tercalated disks linking adjacent cardiocytes in heart 
(see Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue) and in the meninges 
lining the outer surfaces of the brain and spinal cord.
In contrast to  occluding junctions, adjacent cell 
membranes linked by zonula and macula adherens 
are separated by a relatively wide intercellular space. 
This space is occupied by the glycosylated portion 
of proteins of the cadherin family, desmogleins and 
desmocollins, anchored to cytoplasmic plaques con-
taining desmoplakin,  plakoglobin, and plakophilin. 
The cytoplasmic plaques are attached to the cyto-
solic face of the plasma membrane. The interlocking  
of similar cadherins binds two cells together by Ca2+-
dependent homophilic or heterophilic interaction, as 
we have already seen. Inherited disorders of  some 
of  the  desmosomal  components  are  indicated  in 
Figure 1-18.

The human desmosomal cadherins genes include 
four  desmogleins  and  three  desmocollins. Their 
cytoplasmic regions interact with plakoglobin and 
plakophilin. 

Desmoplakin  interacts  with  the  intermediate 
ﬁlaments keratin in epidermis, desmin in the inter-
calated disks, and vimentin in the meninges.  Desmo-
glein 1 and desmoglein 3 maintain the cohesiveness 
of the epidermis, a stratiﬁed squamous epithelium. 
Autoantibodies  to  desmoglein  1  cause  a  blistering 
disease (disruption of cell adhesion) of the skin called 
pemphigus foliaceus (see Figure 1-17).

Hemidesmosomes
Hemidesmosomes are asymmetrical structures an-
choring the basal domain of an epithelial cell to the 
underlying basal lamina (Figure 1-19).

Hemidesmosomes  have  a  different  organization 
compared with a macula adherens or a desmosome. 
A hemidesmosome consists of: 

1.  An  inner  cytoplasmic  plate  associated  with 
intermediate ﬁlaments (also called keratins or tono-
ﬁlaments)  

2.    An  outer  membrane  plaque  linking  the 
hemidesmosome to the basal lamina by  anchoring 
ﬁlaments (composed of laminin 5) and integrin (cid:95)(cid:20)(cid:96)(cid:18)
 Although  hemidesmosomes look like half-desmo-
somes, none of the biochemical components present 
in  the  desmosome  is  found  in  hemidesmosomes.  
Hemidesmosomes  increase  the  overall  stability  of 
epithelial tissues by linking intermediate ﬁlaments of 
the cytoskeleton with components of the basal lamina.
We consider additional details of the hemidesmo-
somes and their role in autoimmune diseases of the 
skin when we discuss the structure of intermediate 
ﬁlaments in the cytoskeleton section.

Gap junctions or communicating junctions
Gap  junctions  are  symmetrical  communicating 
junctions  formed  by  integral  membrane  proteins 
called connexins. 

Six connexin monomers associate to form a con-
nexon, a hollow cylindrical structure that spans the 
plasma  membrane.   The  end-to-end  alignment  of

Tight junctions are circumferential 
belts at the apical domain of 
epithelial cells and linking adjacent

adjacent epithelial cells 
(paracellular pathway). Molecules 
across the cell follow a

the fractured protoplasmic face (PF).

usually found below tight junctions.

connexons in adjacent cells provides a direct chan-
nel of communication (1.5 to 2  nm in diameter) 
between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells (Figure 
1-20). Connexons have a clustering tendency and 
can form patches about 0.3 mm in diameter.

These junctions facilitate the movement of mol-
ecules 1.2 nm in diameter (for example, Ca2+ and 

cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]) between 
cells). The connexon axial channels close when the 
concentration of Ca2+ is high. This junction is re-
sponsible for the chemical and electrical “coupling”
between adjacent cells.  A typical example is  cardiac 
muscle cells connected by gap junctions to enable 
the transmission of electrical  signals.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Connexin mutations 
Several  diseases  occur  when  genes  encoding  con-
nexins are mutated. Mutations in the connexin 26 
(Cx26) gene, highly expressed in cells of the cochlea, 
are associated with deafness.

Mutations  in  the  connexin  32  (Cx32)  gene  are 
found  in  X-linked  Charcot-Marie-Tooth  demy-
elinating neuropathy resulting in progressive degen-
eration of peripheral nerves, characterized by distal 
muscle  weakness  and  atrophy  and  impairment  of 
deep tendon reﬂexes. 

Connexin  32  (Cx32)  protein  is  expressed  in 
Schwann  cells,  which  are  involved  in  the  produc-
tion of rolled myelin tubes around the axons in the 
peripheral nervous system (see Chapter 8, Nervous 
Tissue). Gap junctions couple different parts of the 
rolled myelin tubes of the same Schwann cell, rather 
than different cells. A loss of the functional axial chan-
nels in myelin leads to the demyelinating disorder.
Mutations in the connexin 50 (Cx50) gene are asso-
ciated with congenital cataracts, leading to blindness.
Bone cells (osteoblasts/osteocytes) are connected 
by gap junctions and express connexin 43 (Cx43) 
and connexin 45 (Cx45) proteins. A deletion of the 
Cx43 gene determines skeletal defects and delays in 
mineralization.  

Basement membrane 

The basement membrane consists of two compo-

nents (Figure 1-21):  

1. The  basal  lamina,  a  sheetlike  extracellular 
matrix in direct contact with epithelial cell surfaces. 
The  basal  lamina  results  from  the  self-assembly  of 
laminin molecules with type IV collagen, entactin, 
and proteoglycans. 

2. A reticular lamina, formed by type III collagen 
ﬁbers, supports the basal lamina and is continuous 
with the connective tissue. 

The  basal  and  reticular  laminae  can  be  distin-
guished  by  electron  microscopy.  Under  the  light 
microscope, the combined basal and reticular laminae 
receive the name of basement membrane, which can 
be recognized by the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain 
(see Figure 1-21; see Box 1-D). 

The PAS stain enables the pathologist to determine 
whether an epithelial malignant tumor has invaded 
the  subjacent  connective  tissue  by  cancerous  cells 
breaking through the basement membrane.

The basal lamina has speciﬁc functions in different 
tissues. The double basal lamina of the renal corpuscle 
constitutes the most important element of the glo-
merular ﬁltration barrier during the initial step in the 
formation of urine (see Chapter 14, Urinary System). 
In skeletal muscle, the basal lamina  maintains the 
integrity of the tissue, and its disruption gives rise to 
muscular dystrophies (see Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue). 
Laminin  (Figure  1-22)  is  a  cross-shaped  protein 
consisting of three chains:  the (cid:95) chain, the (cid:96) chain, 
and the (cid:97) chain. Laminin molecules can associate with 
each other to form a meshlike polymer. Laminin and 
type IV collagen are the major components of the 
basal lamina, and both are synthesized by epithelial 
cells resting on the lamina. 

Laminin has binding sites for nidogen (also called 
entactin), proteoglycans (in particular, heparan sulfate 
perlecan),  (cid:95)-dystroglycan  (see  Chapter  7,  Muscle 
Tissue), and integrins.

Plakoglobin and plakophilins (types1-4). Plakoglobin 
interacts directly with the intracellular region of 
cadherins and also binds to desmoplakin and 
plakophilins. Plakophilins participate in the recruitment 
of proteins to the plasma membrane.

Fibronectin  (see  Figure  1-22)  consists  of  two 
protein  chains  cross-linked  by  disulfide  bonds. 
Fibronectin  is  the  main  adhesion  molecule  of  the 
extracellular matrix of the connective tissue and is 
produced by ﬁbroblasts. Fibronectin has binding sites 
for heparin present in proteoglycans, several types of 
collagens (types I, II, III, and V), and ﬁbrin (derived 
from ﬁbrinogen during blood coagulation).

Fibronectin circulating in blood is synthesized in 
the liver by hepatocytes. It differs from ﬁbronectin 

produced by ﬁbroblasts in that it lacks one or two 
repeats (designated EDA and EDB for extra domain 
A and extra domain B) as a result of alternative mRNA 
splicing.  Circulating  ﬁbronectin  binds  to  ﬁbrin,  a 
component of the blood clot formed at the site of 
blood vessel damage. The RGD domain of immobi-
lized ﬁbronectin binds to integrin expressed on the 
surface of  activated platelets, and the blood clot en-
larges. We return to the topic of blood coagulation or 
hemostasis in Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis.

The intercellular channel is an axial 
channel that allows the direct 
passage of small signaling 
molecules between adjacent cells 
to coordinate cell responses. 

Clusters of intercellular 
channels are known as gap 
junctions because of the 
narrow extracellular gap that 
separates the apposed plasma 
membranes.

Six connexin monomers assemble to form a hexameric connexon, a

of one cell align with connexons of an adjacent cell, forming a hydrophilic 
intercellular channel connecting the cytoplasm of the apposed cells.  

 Box 1-C | Cell junctions: Highlights to remember  

•  Cell junctions can be classiﬁed as symmetrical and asymmetrical. Sym-
metrical junctions include tight junctions, belt desmosome (zonula adherens),  
desmosomes (macula adherens), and gap junctions. The hemidesmosome is an 
asymmetrical junction
•  Tight junctions contain occludin and claudin, belonging to the protein family 
of tetraspanins because four segments of each protein span the plasma mem-
brane. An additional component is the afadin-nectin protein complex.
   Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), zonula occludens (ZO) proteins ZO-1, 
ZO-2, and ZO-3 and F-actin are additional protein components. Tight junctions 
form a circumferential gasket that controls the paracellular pathway of molecules.
•  Zonula adherens (belt desmosome) consists of a plaque that contains 
desmoplakin, plakoglobin, and plakophilin. Cadherins, mainly desmocollins and 
desmogleins dimers, and the afadin-nectin complex extend from the plaque to 
the extracellular space. A catenin complex links actin ﬁlaments to the plaque. 
Similar to tight junctions, the belt desmosome forms a circumferential gasket at 
the apical region of epithelial cells.
•  Macula adherens (spot desmosome) are structurally comparable with the 
zonula adherens except that the afadin-nectin and catenin complexes are absent 
and intermediate  ﬁlaments (tonoﬁlaments), instead of actin ﬁlaments, are at-
tached to the plaque.
•  Hemidesmosomes consist of an inner membrane plate, to which tonoﬁla-
ments attach, and an outer membrane plaque, linked by integrin (cid:95)6(cid:96)4 and 
laminin 5 to the basal lamina.
•  Tight junctions, belt desmosomes, spot desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes 
are anchoring junctions. Gap junctions are not anchoring junctions. Instead, 
gap junctions are communicating junctions connecting adjacent cells. The basic 
unit of a gap junction is the connexon, formed by 6 connexin molecules encir-
cling a central channel.

Cell junctions

Epithelium: Highlights to remember  
Figure 1-23 presents the highlights of cell adhesion 
molecules and cell junctions. 

1. An epithelium is a continuous sheet of polarized 

cells supported by a basement membrane. 

2. The polarized nature of an epithelium depends 
on the tight junctions that separate the polarized cells 
into apical and basolateral regions. 

3. Tight junctions control the paracellular pathway 
of solutes, ions, and water. Tight junctions form a belt 
around the circumference of each cell. 

4. Endothelial cells, the constituents of a simple 
squamous epithelium, are linked by tight and spot 
desmosomes  tightly  regulated  to  maintain  the  in-
tegrity  of  the  endothelium  and  protect  the  vessels 
from unregulated permeability, inﬂammation, and 
reactions leading to blood coagulation in the lumen 
(see Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System). 

5. Leukocytes reach the site of infection by attach-
ing  to  endothelial  cell  surfaces  and  migrate  across 
the  endothelium  into  the  underlying  tissues  by  a 
mechanism called diapedesis. Leukocytes ﬁnd their 
way  through  endothelial  cell-cell  junctions  after 
docking to activated or resting endothelial cells by 
the endothelial cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and 
VCAM-1 (see Figure 1-10). ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 
bind  to  (cid:96)2  and  (cid:96)1  integrin  subunits  in  leukocytes 
(see Figure 1-12).

6. The  cohesive  nature  of  the  epithelium  de-
pends on three factors: cell junctions, cell adhesive 
molecules and the interaction of integrins with the 
extracellular matrix, produced to a large extent by 
ﬁbroblasts. 

7. The basal lamina is essential for the differentia-

tion of epithelial cells during embryogenesis.

Note in Figure 1-23 that:

1. The  basal  domain  of  epithelial  cells  interacts 
with  the  basal  lamina  through  hemidesmosomes 
and integrins. Hemidesmosomes, so called because 
of their appearance as half-desmosomes in electron 
micrographs, are anchored to the basal lamina ouside 
the cell and to a network of keratin intermediate ﬁla-
ments inside the cell through a plate-plaque complex. 
Mutations  in  hemidesmosome  components  cause 
severe skin blistering as a result of a rupture of the 
anchoring molecular integrity.

2.  Integrins  interact  directly  with  laminin  and 
ﬁbronectin, in particular the RGD domain to which 
integrins bind. Inside the cell, integrins interact with 
actin microﬁlaments.  Integrins connect the extra-
cellular environment to the intracellular space. We 
have seen that some ADAM proteins can use their 
disintegrin  domain  to  prevent  integrin  binding  to 
extracellular matrix ligands.

3.  Collagens  and  proteoglycans  do  not  interact 
directly  with  the  basal  domain  of  epithelial  cells.

The basement membrane, an extracellular component in direct 
contact with the basal domain of epithelial cells, is visible under the 
light microscope after staining with the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) 
reagent technique.
       At the electron microscopic level, the basement membrane is 
defined by two layers or laminae: 
   1. A basal lamina, which contains laminin, fibronectin, type IV 
collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and nidogen (also called 
entactin). 
    2. A reticular lamina, which contains type III collagen (reticular 
fibers) 
The components of these two laminae are glycoproteins. They are 
PAS positive.

Under light microscopy, both laminae are resolved as 
a single basement membrane after staining with the 
PAS technique.

Each lamina can be resolved as a separate entity by electron microscopy.

Instead, this interaction is mediated by laminin and

4. The lateral domains of  adjacent epithelial cells 
communicate by gap junctions (not shown in Figure 
1-23). In contrast to tight junctions and belt and spot 
desmosomes, gap junctions are not anchoring devices. 
They consist of intercellular channels connecting the

•  PAS is a widely used histochemical technique to show 1,2-glycol or 1,2-amino-
alcohol groups, such as those present in glycogen, mucus, and glycoproteins.
•  Periodic acid, an oxidant, converts these groups to aldehydes.  The Schiff 
reagent, a colorless fuchsin, reacts with the aldehydes to form a characteristic 
red-purple (magenta) product.
•  Some important PAS-positive structures are the basement membrane, 
glycocalyx, mucus produced by goblet cells, stored glycoprotein hormones in 
cells of the pituitary gland, and collagens.

cytoplasm of adjacent cells. They are communicating 
junctions.

5.  Cadherins  and  the  afadin-nectin  complex  are 
present in tight junctions and zonula adherens. Actin 
microﬁlaments are associated with these two junctions 
but there is a difference: catenins are present in zonula 
adherens but not in tight junctions.

Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton  is  a  three-dimensional  network  of 
proteins  distributed  throughout  the  cytoplasm  of 
eukaryotic cells. 

The cytoskeleton has roles in:  
1. Cell movement (crawling of blood cells along 
blood-vessel  walls,  migration  of  ﬁbroblasts  during 
wound healing, and movement of cells during em-
bryonic development)

chains. Variants for each chain 
give rise to several laminin 
isoforms with different structure 
and function.

cell surface receptors 
(integrins), type IV collagen, 
and other adhesion proteins 
(e.g., nidogen, also known as

There are two forms of fibronectin:

by hepatocytes and secreted into 
the bloodstream.  
   2. Cellular fibronectin, produced 
by fibroblasts, forms part of the 
extracellular matrix.

6. Changes in cell shape 
The components of the cytoskeleton were origi-
nally identiﬁed by electron microscopy.  These early 
studies described a system of cytoplasmic “cables” that 
fell into three size groups, as follows: 

1. Microﬁlaments (7 nm thick)  
2. Intermediate ﬁlaments (10 nm thick)  
3. Microtubules (25 nm in diameter)  
Biochemical  studies,  involving  the  extraction  of 
cytoskeletal proteins from cells with detergents and 
salts  and  in  vitro  translation  of  speciﬁc  mRNA, 
showed that each class of ﬁlaments has a unique pro-
tein organization. When cytoskeletal proteins were 
puriﬁed, they were used as antigens for the produc-
tion of antibodies. Antibodies are used as tools for 
the localization of the various cytoskeletal proteins 
in the cell.  The immunocytochemical localization 

of cytoskeletal proteins (Figure 1-24) and cell treat-
ment with various chemical agents disrupting the 
normal organization of the cytoskeleton have been 
instrumental in understanding the organization and 
function of the cytoskeleton.

Microﬁlaments
The  main  component  of  microﬁlaments  is  actin. 
Actin ﬁlaments are composed of globular monomers 
(G-actin,  42  kd),  which  polymerize  to  form  long 
helical ﬁlaments intertwined in a helix (F-actin). 

Actin  is  a  versatile  and  abundant  cytoskeletal 
component forming static and contractile bundles 
and ﬁlamentous networks speciﬁed by actin-binding 
proteins and their distinctive location and function 
in a cell.  F-actin bundles are present in the microvilli 
of  the intestinal  (Figure 1-25) and renal epithelial 
cells (brush border) and the stereocilia from the hair 
cells of the inner ear.  

We have already seen that the intracellular portion 
of the cell adhesion molecules cadherins and integrin 
(cid:96)1  interacts  with  F-actin  through    linker  proteins 
(see Figures 1-8 and 1-11).  As discussed in Chapter 
6,  Blood  and  Hematopoiesis,  actin,  together  with 
spectrin, forms a ﬁlamentous network on the inner 
face of the red blood cell membrane that is crucial 
for maintaining the shape and integrity of red blood 
cells. Spectrin is a tetramer consisting of two distinct 
polypeptide chains ((cid:95) and (cid:96)).

Actin  ﬁlaments  are  polar.  Growth  of  actin  ﬁla-
ments  may  occur  at  both  ends;  however,  one  end 
(the “barbed end” or plus end) grows faster than the 
other end (the “pointed end” or  minus end). The 
names correspond to the arrowhead appearance of 
myosin head bound at an angle to actin.  

Actin  ﬁlaments  can  branch  in  the  leading  edge 
(lamellipodia) of cells involved in either motility or 
interaction with other cell types. F-actin branching 
is initiated from the side of a preexisting actin ﬁla-
ment by Arp2/3 (for actin-related protein), an actin 
nucleating complex of  seven proteins (Figure 1-26).  
Formin regulates the assembly of unbranched actin 
in cell protrusions such as the intestinal microvilli 
(see Figure 1-25).

 Actin monomers have a binding site for adenos-
ine  triphosphate  (ATP),  which  is  hydrolyzed  to 
adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP)  as  polymerization 
proceeds. Actin polymerization is ATP-dependent 
(see Box 1-E).

The  kinetics  of  actin  polymerization  involves  a 
mechanism known as treadmilling: G-actin mono-
mers assembled at one end of the ﬁlament concur-
rently disassemble at the other end (see Figure 1-26). 
Four types of proteins control treadmilling (see Figure 
1-26), as follows: 

1. Thymosin sequesters pools of G-actin mono-

mers within cells.

Cell junctions

Figure 1-23. Summary of cell junctions and cell adhesion molecules

Zonula adherens (belt desmosome)
It consists of a dense plaque associated with the catenin complex ((cid:95)-catenin, (cid:96)-catenin and p120), 
(cid:95)-actinin, vinculin and formin-1.  Actin filaments are attached to the catenin complex. The 
intercellular space is bridged by cadherins and the afadin-nectin complex connecting the opposite 
dense plaques.

Immunoglobulin superfamily
Cell adhesion molecules belong 
to the immunoglobulin 
superfamily because they 
contain domains similar to 
immunoglobulins. CAMs do not 
require Ca2+ to maintain 
homophilic adhesive 
interactions.

Selectin
Selectins are 
Ca2+-dependent molecules 
with binding affinity for 
sugars. Selectins have an 
important role in the homing 
process.  

Hemidesmosomes
Hemidesmosomes consist of 
an inner plate, the anchoring 
site of the intermediate 
filament keratin and an outer 
plaque, attached to the basal 
lamina by two major 
components: anchoring 
filaments (laminin 5) and 
integrin (cid:95)6(cid:96)4.

Tight junctions (occluding junctions)
Consist of the transmembrane proteins 
occludin and claudins, associated with 
ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, and the afadin-nectin 
complex at the intracellular side. Occludin 
and claudins seal the intercellular space.

Macula adherens (spot

Desmosomes are 
symmetrical structures 
consisting of: (1) plaques

plakoglobin and 
plakophilins (2) linking 
cadherins (mainly 
desmocollins and 
desmogleins) and (3) 
keratin filaments attached 
to the plaques. 

Integrins
On the extracellular side, 
integrins interact directly 
with fibronectin and 
laminin. On the 
intracellular side, the (cid:96) 
subunits of integrin 
interact with actin through 
intermediate proteins 
(including (cid:95)-actinin, 
vinculin, and talin). 

Laminin
Laminin consists of three 
polypeptide chains ((cid:95), (cid:96), 
and (cid:97)) with binding sites 
for type IV collagen, 
proteoglycan perlecan, 
integrin, and nidogen.

2. Proﬁlin suppresses nucleation of G-actin and 
promotes F-actin growth at the barbed end. Proﬁlin 
can favor the assembly of monomeric G-actin into 
filaments  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  bound 
ADP for ATP. Only ATP-actin monomers can be 
assembled into ﬁlaments. 

3. Coﬁlin (also known as actin depolymerizing fac-
tor) triggers depolymerization of ADP-bound actin 
at the pointed end. Similar to proﬁlin and thymosin, 
coﬁlin forms a dimeric complex with G-actin.

4. Gelsolin has a dual role: it is a capping protein 
and prevents the loss and addition of actin mono-
mers, and it is a severing protein. In the presence of 
Ca2+, gelsolin fragments actin ﬁlaments and remains 
bound to the barbed end, forming a cap that prevents 
further ﬁlament growth.

In  the  core  of  the    intestinal  microvilli,  the  as-
sembly of G-actin monomers into ﬁlaments and the 
organization of these ﬁlaments into thick bundles are 
controlled by various types of actin-binding or actin-
related proteins.  A bundle of parallel nonbranching 
actin ﬁlaments, forming the core of the microvillus, 
is held together by actin-linking proteins, villin and 
ﬁmbrin. Side arms of myosin-I and the Ca2+-binding 
protein calmodulin anchor the bundle to the plasma 
membrane (see Figure 1-25). 

Arp2/3 and additional regulatory proteins form a 
nucleation complex for the assembly of branching 
actin ﬁlaments. 

Branching  actin  ﬁlaments  assemble  at  the  lead-
ing edge of a cell during cell motility. In  microvilli,

Direct  immunocytochemistry involves  
a specific antibody or some agent with 
specific binding affinity to an antigen 
tagged with a visible marker.  Visible 
markers attached to the immunoglobulin 
molecule can be a fluorescent dye such 
as fluorescein (green fluorescence) or 
rhodamine (red fluorescence). When  
examined with a fluorescence 
microscope, only labeled  components 
are visible as bright, fluorescent 
structures. Direct immunofluorescence 
involves a single incubation step and 
provides a simple detection system.

homology domains, FH1 and FH2), instead of the 
Arp2/3 complex, seem to regulate the elongation of 
nonbranching actin ﬁlaments, while remaining at-
tached to the barbed end (see Box 1-E). 

Formins are located at the tip of the microvillus, 

the cap region (see Figure 1-25). 

Male patients with defects in proteins that activate 
the Arp2/3 complex, in particular a protein of the 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, 
display recurrent respiratory infections because of he-
reditary immunodeﬁciency, thrombocytopenia (low 
platelet count) present from birth on and eczema of 
the skin after the ﬁrst month of life (see Box 1-F). 
The mutation is inherited from the mother, a healthy 
carrier of the defective gene.  

Microvilli  and  stereocilia  are  comparable  struc-
tures, although they differ in length and the number 
of actin ﬁlaments: 

1. Intestinal microvilli are 1 to 2 (cid:43)m long, 0.1 (cid:43)m 
wide, and consist of 20 to 30 bundled actin ﬁlaments.
2. Stereocilia in hair cells of the inner ear have a 
tapered shape at their base, the length range is 1.5 to 
5.5 (cid:43)m, and each actin bundle contains up to 900 
actin ﬁlaments. 

Hair  cells  are  extremely  sensitive  to  mechanical 
displacement, and a slight movement of the stereo-
cilium is ampliﬁed into changes in electric potential 
transmitted to the brain. 

We study hair cells of the inner ear in Chapter 9,

and(cid:3) (cid:96)-tubulin. Tubulin  subunits  are  arranged  in 
longitudinal  rows  called  protoﬁlaments. Thirteen 
protoﬁlaments associate side by side with each other 
to form a cylinder of microtubules with a hollow core. 
The diameter of a microtubule is 25 nm.  

Similar to actin ﬁlaments, microtubules are struc-
turally  polarized.  Microtubules  have  a  plus  end, 
which grows more rapidly than the minus end (see 
Figure 1-27).

In  contrast  to  actin  ﬁlaments,  most  individual 
microtubules  seem  to  undergo  alternate  phases  of 
slow  growth  and  rapid  depolymerization. This 
process, called dynamic instability, consists of three 
major steps:

Most individual microtubules

known as dynamic

   Dynamic instability results 
from the hydrolysis of 
GTP-tubulin dimers, release

and subsequent release of 
GDP-tubulin subunits.

Each protofilament has a 
definite structural polarity: 
(cid:96)-tubulin is exposed at one

(cid:95)-tubulin is exposed at the 
other end (the minus end).
   Polarity is essential for the 
dynamics of microtubule 
growth and the directional 
movement of organelles 
along microtubules and 
separation of chromosomes 
during cell division.

•  The Arp2/3 complex is necessary for nucleating the assembly of branched 
networks of actin ﬁlaments. The function of phagocytic cells and platelets 
depends on a functional actin cytoskeleton. 
•  Numerous proteins activate the Arp2/3 complex. Without these proteins, the 
Arp2/3 complex is inactive.
•  Two major proteins that bind and activate the Arp2/3 complex include the 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, which consists of several 
members (WASP, neuronal WASP [N-WASP] and SCAR/WAVE1-3 [suppressor 
of cAMP receptor/WASP family verprolin-homologous protein 1-3]). Additional 
members belong to the cortactin family, which includes cortactin and hemato-
poietic-speciﬁc protein.
•  Mutations in the WASP gene, present in the X chromosome, are character-
ized by recurrent respiratory infections (defective function of T and B cells), a 
reduction in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) leading to increased 
susceptibility to bleeding, and eczema of the skin. Males but not females are 
affected by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

tubulin subunits are released from the minus end at 
a fast rate. 

The polymerization-to-depolymerization transition 
frequency is known as catastrophe; the depolymeriza-
tion-to-polymerization transition frequency is known 
as rescue.

 The stability of microtubules can be modiﬁed by 
microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs are 
classiﬁed into two groups: 

1.  Classical  MAPs,  such  as  MAP1A,  MAP1B, 

MAP2, and tau.

2. Nonclassical MAPs, including Lis1 and DCX 
family  members.  MAPs  stabilize  microtubules  by 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. 

In Chapter 7, Nervous Tissue, we discuss the sig-
niﬁcance of tau phosphorylation and dephosphory-
lation  in  Alzheimer’s  disease.  A  lack  of  expression 
of Lis1 causes a sever brain developmental disorder 
called lissencephaly. 

Centrosome 
The centrosome, the major microtubule-organizing 
center  in  cells,  consist  of  a  pair  of  centrioles  sur-
rounded  by  the  pericentriolar  material,  an  amor-
phous, electron-dense substance rich in proteins such 
as pericentrin and (cid:97)-tubulin. 

The centrosome has four major functions: 
1. It nucleates the polymerization of tubulin sub-

units into microtubules.

2. It organizes microtubules into functional units, 

for example, the mitotic spindle.

3. It duplicates once every cell cycle in preparation 

for cell division.

4. It gives rise to basal body precursors, the origina-

tors of multiple or single cilia. 

Centrosome abnormalities, in particular an increase 
in their number, are frequent in human tumors and 
correlate with advanced tumor grade and metastasis.  
Therefore,  centrosome  ampliﬁcation  has  a  lethal 
effect  by  preventing  cells  to  assemble  normal    mi-
totic  spindles  but  also  enhancing  the  potential  of 
tumorigenesis. 

Centrosomes are part of the mitotic center, which, 
together  with  the  mitotic  spindle,  constitutes  the 
mitotic  (or  meiotic)  apparatus  (Figure  1-28).    A 
centriole is a small cylinder (0.2 (cid:43)m wide and 0.4 
(cid:43)m  long)  composed  of  nine  microtubule  triplets 
in a helicoid array.  In contrast to most cytoplasmic 
microtubules, which display dynamic instability, the 
centriolar microtubules are very stable. 

During interphase, centrioles are oriented at right 
angles to each other. Before mitosis, centrioles repli-
cate and form two pairs. During mitosis, each pair 
can be found at opposite poles of the cell, where they 
direct the formation of the mitotic or meiotic spindle. 
There are three types of microtubules extending 

The mitotic (or meiotic) apparatus 
consists of two components:
1. The mitotic center.
2. The mitotic spindle. 
The three components of the mitotic 
center are the microtubule 
organizing center surrounding a pair 
of centrioles and radiating 
microtubules (also called astral 
microtubules) anchoring the mitotic 
center to the plasma membrane.
   The mitotic spindle consists of two 
major classes of microtubules 
originating in the mitotic center: the 
kinetochore microtubules, anchored 
to the centromeres of the metaphase 
chromosomes, and the polar 
microtubules, which overlap with 
each other in the center of the cell 
and are not attached to 
chromosomes.

3.  Polar  microtubules,  extending  from  the  two 
poles of the spindle where opposite centrosomes are 
located (see Figure 1-28). 

Kinetochores  are  formed  by  several  proteins  as-
sembled  on  centromeric  DNA  during  mitosis  and 
meiosis. The  centromere  is  the  chromosomal  site 
where the kinetochore assembles. If kinetochores fail 
to assemble, chromosomes cannot segregate properly 
(see Box 1-H).

The pericentriolar material contains the (cid:97)-tubulin 
ring complex and numerous proteins, including peri-

One of the principal functions of the inner sheath and radial spokes is 
the stabilization of axonemal bending. Tektins are filamentous proteins

provide a scaffold to microtubules or have a role in the assembly of 
axoneme-associated structures.

Figure 1-30. Agents that prevent microtubular function

Colchicine binding to tubulin dimers 
prevents their assembly into microtubules. 
Vinblastine and vincristine, used in 
antitumor therapy, also inhibit tubulin 
polymerization. Nocodazole is another 
protein inhibitor of tubulin polymerization.

Tubulin-colchicine complex

Taxol binds to microtubules preventing 
their depolymerization. Taxol disrupts 
mitosis by affecting the dynamic assembly 
and disassembly of the mitotic spindle 
required for the separation of 
chromosomes into daughter cells.

Antimitotic drugs are potent inhibitors of the 
polymerization and depolymerization of 
microtubules of the mitotic spindle. 
Antimitotic drugs bind to diverse sites on 
tubulin, and their combination can be 
therapeutically more efficient.

centrin. Each (cid:97)-tubulin ring complex is the nucle-
ation site or template for the assembly and growth of 
one microtubule. The centrioles do not have a direct 
role in the nucleation of microtubules in the centro-
some. Tubulin dimers associate to the (cid:97)-tubulin ring 
by the (cid:95)-tubulin subunit. Consequently, the minus 
end of each microtubule points to the centrosome; 
the plus end, the growing end, is oriented outward, 
free in the cytoplasm.   

The axoneme of cilia and ﬂagella
Early in this chapter, we indicate that centrosomes 
give  rise  to  precursor  basal  bodies,  which  are  the 
outgrowth origin of cilia (see Figure 1-6) and ﬂagella. 
Motile cilia and ﬂagella are cytoplasmic extensions 

 Box 1-G |  Microtubules: Highlights to remember

•  Microtubules are structures consisting of tubulin dimers, (cid:95) and (cid:96), which 
polymerize in the presence of GTP into longitudinal rows of protoﬁlaments. Each 
tubulin monomer binds one GTP molecule. Thirteen parallel protoﬁlaments form 
a cylinder or microtubule 25 nm in diameter.
•  Similar to F-actin, microtubules have a distinct polarity: a  plus or polymerizing 
end and a minus or depolymerizing end.
•  Microtubules undergo alternate phases of slow growth and rapid depolymer-
ization, a process known as dynamic instability.
•  Centrioles, basal bodies, and axonemes of cilia and ﬂagella contain a precise 
array of microtubules.
•  Kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, two molecular motor proteins, use microtu-
bules as tracks for the transport of vesicle and nonvesicle cargos.

containing a core of microtubules, the axoneme (Fig-
ure 1-29). The axoneme consists of nine peripheral 
microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of 
microtubules. This arrangement is known as the 9 + 2
conﬁguration. 

Each  peripheral  doublet  consists  of  a  complete 
microtubule  (called  an  A  tubule,  with  13  proto-
ﬁlaments), sharing its wall with a second, partially 
completed microtubule (called a B tubule, with 10 
to 11 protoﬁlaments).  Extending inward from the A 
tubule are radial spokes that insert into an amorphous 
inner  sheath  surrounding  the  central  microtubule 
pair. Adjacent peripheral doublets are linked by the 
protein nexin (see Box 1-I).

Projecting from the sides of the A tubule are sets 
of protein arms: the inner and outer arms of dynein, 
a  microtubule-associated  adenosine  triphosphatase 
(ATPase).  In  the  presence  of  ATP,  the  sliding  of 
peripheral doublets relative to each other bends cilia 
and ﬂagella. Sliding and bending of microtubules are 
the basic events of their motility.

Ciliopathies can occur when defects occur during:
1. The multiplication and docking of the centro-
some-derived precursor basal bodies. An example is 
the enhanced expression of the protein CP110   that 
prevents the attachment of basal bodies to the plasma 
membrane, leading to primary ciliary dyskinesia. 

2.   The transport of proteins during the assembly 
of  cilia  and  ﬂagella,  resulting  in  the  Bardet-Biedl 
syndrome (see Box 1-J; see Figure 1-6). 

Clinical  signiﬁcance:  Microtubule-targeted  drugs. 
Sterility
Two groups of antimitotic drugs act on microtubules:
1. Microtubule-destabilizing agents, which inhibit 

microtubule polymerization.

2.  Microtubule-stabilizing  agents,  which  affect 
microtubule  function  by  suppressing  dynamic  in-
stability. 

 The  ﬁrst  group  includes  colchicine,  colcemid, 
vincristine, and vinblastine, which bind to tubulin 
and  inhibit  microtubule  polymerization,  blocking 
mitosis. Colchicine is used clinically in the treatment 
of gout. Vincristine and vinblastine, from Vinca alka-
loids isolated from the leaves of the periwinkle plant, 
have been successfully used  in childhood hematologic 
malignancies  (leukemias).    Neurotoxicity,  resulting 
from the disruption of the microtubule-dependent 
axonal ﬂow (loss of microtubules and binding of mo-
tor proteins to microtubules), and myelosuppression 
are two side effects of microtubule-targeted drugs. 

The  second  group  includes  taxol  (isolated  from 
the bark of the yew tree) with an opposite effect: It 
stabilizes microtubules instead of inhibiting their as-
sembly (Figure 1-30).  Paclitaxel (taxol) has been  used 
widely to treat breast and ovarian cancers. Similar to 
Vinca alkaloids, its main side effects are neurotoxicity

(leading to sterility).

Box 1-H  |  Differences between centromeres and kinetochores

•  The terms centromere and kinetochore are often used synonymously, but do 
not mean the same thing.
•  The centromere (not the centrosome) is the chromosomal site associated with 
microtubules of the spindle. Centromeres can be recognized cytologically as a nar-
row chromatin region on metaphase chromosomes known as primary constriction 
where centromeric DNA is present.
•  The kinetochore consists of proteins assembled on the centromeric chromatin 
on sister chromatids.  The assembly of the kinetochore depends exclusively on the 
presence of centromeric DNA sequences. The centromere and the kinetochore 
mediate attachment of the kinetochore microtubules of the spindle. 

Microtubules: Cargo transport and motor proteins
The transport of vesicles and nonvesicle cargos occurs 
along microtubules and F-actin. 

Speciﬁc molecular motors associate to microtubules 
and  F-actin  to  mobilize  cargos  to  speciﬁc  intracel-
lular sites. 

Microtubule-based  molecular  motors  include 
kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein for the long-range
transport of cargos. 

F-actin–based molecular motors include uncon-
ventional myosin Va and VIIa for the short-range 
transport of cargos. We discuss additional aspects of 
the F-actin–based cargo transport mechanism dur-
ing  the  transport  of  melanosomes  in  Chapter  11, 
Integumentary System.

  Three  examples  of  microtubule-based  cargo 
transport in mammalian systems are as follows (see 
Box 1-K): 

1. Axonemal transport, including ﬂagella (intraﬂa-
gellar  transport)  and  cilia  (intraciliary  transport) 
(Figure 1-31).  During axonemal transport, particles 
are  mobilized  by  kinesin  and  cytoplasmic  dynein 
along the microtubule doublets of the axoneme.

Box 1-I | Major components of the ciliary and ﬂagellar axonemes

•  Microtubules: Major component of the axoneme.  Motor proteins use microtu-
bules of the axoneme as tracks for intraciliary or intraﬂagellar cargo transport. 
Microtubule-based axonal transport also depends on motor proteins. 

•  Tektins: Intermediate ﬁlament-like proteins extending along the length of 

axonemal microtubules and, presumably, adding mechanical strength to the 
axoneme.

•  Dynein arms: ATPase responsible for ciliary and ﬂagellar movement. The 

heads are in contact with the adjacent outer microtubules at a periodic distance 
and move along them.

•  Nexin links: A beltlike arrangement stabilizing the nine outer concentric pairs 

of microtubules.

• Radial spokes: Project from each of the nine outer microtubule doublets to the 

inner sheath surrounding the central pair. 

• Inner sheath: A structure surrounding the central pair of microtubules, in 

contact with the globular end of the radial spokes.

of the manchette,  a transient structure assembled 
during  the  elongation  of  the  spermatid  head  (see 
Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis).

Microtubules: Axonal transport
Axons are cytoplasmic extensions of neurons respon-
sible for the conduction of neuronal impulses. Mem-
brane-bound vesicles containing neurotransmitters 
produced in the cell body of the neuron travel to the 
terminal portion of the axon, where the content of 
the vesicle is released at the synapse. 

Bundles of microtubules form tracks within the 
axon to carry these vesicles. Vesicles are transported 
by two motor proteins (see Figure 1-31): 

1. Kinesin  
2. Cytoplasmic dynein
Kinesins and cytoplasmic dyneins participate in 

two types of intracellular transport movements: 

1. Saltatory movement, deﬁned by the continuous 
and random movement of mitochondria and vesicles. 
2.  Axonal  transport,  a  more  direct  intracellular 

movement of membrane-bound structures.  

Kinesins  and  cytoplasmic  dyneins  have  two 
ATP-binding heads and a tail. Energy derives from 
continuous ATP hydrolysis by ATPases present in the 
heads. The head domains interact with microtubules, 
and the tail binds to speciﬁc receptor binding sites 

Box 1-J |  Bardet-Biedl syndrome                  

•  Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic (multisystemic) disorder that 
includes age-related retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal dysplasia, 
reproductive tract abnormalities, and learning disabilities. 
•  BBS is a disorder of basal bodies and cilia resulting from a defective 
microtubule-based transport function (intraciliary transport) required for the 
assembly, maintenance, and function of basal bodies, cilia, and ﬂagella  
(intraﬂagellar transport).
•  Eight BBS genes (BBS1-8) have been identiﬁed. The degree of clinical vari-
ability in BBS is not fully explained.

on the surface of  vesicles and organelles. 

 Kinesin uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to move 
vesicles from the cell body of the neuron toward the 
end  portion  of  the  axon  (anterograde  transport). 
Cytoplasmic dynein also uses ATP to move vesicles in 
the opposite direction (retrograde transport).

Myosin family of proteins
Members of the myosin family of proteins bind and 
hydrolyze ATP to provide energy for their movement 
along actin ﬁlaments from the pointed (minus) end 
to the barbed (plus) end. Myosin I and myosin II 
are the predominant members of the myosin family 
(Figure 1-32; see Box 1-L).

Myosin I, regarded as an unconventional myosin, is 
found in all cell types and has only one head domain 
and a tail. The head is associated with a single light 
chain. The head interacts with actin ﬁlaments and 
contains ATPase, which enables myosin I to move 
along the ﬁlaments by binding, detaching, and re-
binding. The tail binds to vesicles or organelles. When 
myosin I moves along an actin ﬁlament, the vesicle 
or organelle is transported. Myosin I molecules are 
smaller than myosin II molecules, lack a long tail, and 
do not form dimers.

Myosin II, a conventional myosin, is present in 
muscle and nonmuscle cells. Myosin II consists of a 
pair of identical molecules. Each molecule consists 
of  an  ATPase-containing  head  domain  and  a  long 
rodlike tail. The tails of the dimer link to each other 
along  their  entire  length  to  form  a  two-stranded 
coiled rod. The tail of myosin II self-assembles into 
dimers,  tetramers,  and  a  bipolar  ﬁlament  with  the 
heads pointing away from the midline. 

The  two  heads,  linked  together  but  pointing  in 
opposite directions, bind to adjacent actin ﬁlaments 
of opposite polarity. Each myosin head bound to F-
actin moves toward the barbed (positive) end. Con-
sequently, the two actin ﬁlaments are moved against 
each other, and contraction occurs (see Figure 1-32).  
Heads  and  tails  of  myosin  II  can  be  cleaved  by 
enzymes (trypsin or papain) into light meromyosin 
(LMM)  and  heavy  meromyosin  (HMM).  LMM 
forms ﬁlaments, but lacks ATPase activity and does 
not bind to actin. HMM binds to actin, is capable of 
ATP hydrolysis, and does not form ﬁlaments. HMM 
is  responsible  for  generating  force  during  muscle 
contraction. HMM can be cleaved further into two 
subfragments called S1. Each S1 fragment contains 
ATPase and light chains and binds actin. 

Myosin V, an unconventional myosin, is double-
headed  with  a  coiled  double  tail. The  head  region 
binds to F-actin; the distal globular ends of the tails 
bind to Rab27a, a receptor on vesicle membranes. 
Myosin Va mediates vesicular transport along F-actin 
tracks. A speciﬁc example is the transport of melano-

 Box 1-K | Microtubule-based cargo transport by molecular motors
  

•  Microtubules participate in the intracellular trafﬁc of vesicles and nonvesicle 
materials or cargos. 
•  Molecular motor proteins, such as kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, mediate 
the long-range transport of cargos, whereas short-range transport occurs on 
actin ﬁlaments.
•There are speciﬁc microtubule-based transport systems: 
  (1) Intraﬂagellar transport (IFT) , including intraciliary transport. 
  (2) Axonal transport. 
  (3) Intramanchette transport (IMT).
  • IFT transport is essential for the delivery of tubulin dimers and other 
molecules to the distal polymerization end of microtubules of cilia and ﬂagella. 
Axonemes originate from basal bodies, centriole-derived, microtubule-contain-
ing structures. 
  • Axonal transport is required for the trafﬁc of neurotransmitter-containing 
vesicles and mitochondria to neuronal synapses. 
  • IMT transport has similar mechanistic characteristics and common boundar-
ies with IFT.  The manchette is a transient microtubule-containing structure that 
organizes during the elongation of the spermatid head and then disassembles.

somes from melanocytes to keratinocytes, ﬁrst along 
microtubules and later along F-actin (see Chapter 11, 
Integumentary System). 

Mutations  in  the  Rab27a  and  myosin Va  genes 
disrupt the F-actin transport of melanosomes. An 
example in humans is Griscelli syndrome, a rare au-
tosomal recessive disorder characterized by pigment 
dilution of the hair caused by defects in melanosome 
transport and associated with disrupted T cell cyto-
toxic activity and neurologic complications. 

Figure 1-33 summarizes the relevant structural and 

functional characteristics of motor proteins.

 Box 1-L | The myosin family

•  Myosins are members of a large family of motor proteins that generate move-
ment along actin ﬁlaments using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. 
•  Two groups of myosins exist: conventional myosin (myosin II), which 
drives muscle contraction and contractile processes in nonmuscle cells, and 
unconventional (nonmuscle) myosins (myosin I and myosin V among others), 
involved in the movement of vesicle cargos inside cells.  
•  Myosin I is single-headed and has a tail shorter than myosin II. Myosin I is 
involved in vesicle transport along F-actin.
•  Myosin II consists of two polypeptides, each displaying a globular head at-
tached to a tail coiled around the tail of its partner.  The tails can self-assemble 
into bipolar ﬁlaments. Each head, which also contains a light chain, has an 
actin-binding site with ATPase activity stimulated by actin binding and regulated 
by the light chain.
•  Myosin V is double-headed with coiled double tails. The heads contain ATP 
and actin binding sites.  The distal end of  the tails is recruited by vesicles. The 
recruitment is mediated by the vesicle receptor Rab27a. 
•  Myosin V-Rab27a interaction plays a role in the transfer of melanosomes from 
melanocytes to keratinocytes. Defective transfer of melanosome from melano-
cytes to keratinocytes of the hair shaft by a mutation of Rab27a or myosin Va 
genes is the cause of Griscelli syndrome type I and II.  Patients with Griscelli 
syndrome have silvery hair, partial albinism, occasional neurologic defects, and 
immunodeﬁciency.

Myosin light-chain kinase 
The  self-assembly  of  myosin  II    and  interaction 
with actin ﬁlaments in nonmuscle cells takes place 
in certain sites according to functional needs. These 
events are controlled by the enzyme myosin light-
chain  kinase  (MLCK),  which  phosphorylates  one 
of  the  myosin  light  chains  (called  the  regulatory 
light chain) present on the myosin head. The activity 
of MLCK is regulated by the Ca2+-binding protein 
calmodulin (Figure 1-34). 

MLCK has a catalytic domain and a regulatory 
domain.  When  calmodulin  and  Ca2+  bind  to  the 
regulatory domain, the catalytic activity of the kinase 
is released. The MLCK–calmodulin–Ca2+ complex 
catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP 
to the myosin light chain, and myosin cycles along 
F-actin to generate force and muscle contraction.

Phosphorylation of one of the myosin light chains 

results in two effects: 

1. It exposes the actin-binding site on the myosin 
head. This step is essential for an interaction of the 
myosin head with the F-actin bundle.

2.  It  releases  the  myosin  tail  from  its  sticky  at-
tachment site near the myosin head. This step also 
is critical because only myosin II stretched tails can 
self-assemble  and  generate  bipolar  ﬁlaments,  a  re-
quirement for muscle contraction (see Figure 1-33).  
In smooth muscle cells, a phosphatase removes the 
phosphate group from myosin light chains. Skeletal 
muscle contraction does not require phosphorylation 
of the myosin light chains. We discuss additional de-
tails of muscle contraction when we study the muscle 
tissue (see Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue).

Intermediate ﬁlaments
Intermediate  ﬁlaments  (Figure  1-35)  represent  a 
heterogeneous group of structures so named because 
their  diameter  (10  nm)  is    intermediate    between 
those of microtubules (25 nm) and microﬁlaments 
(7 nm). Intermediate ﬁlaments are the most stable 
cytoskeletal structures. 

Detergent and salt treatments extract microﬁlament 
and microtubule components and leave intermediate 
ﬁlaments insoluble. The structure of the intermedi-
ate  ﬁlament  does  not  ﬂuctuate  between  assembly 
and disassembly states similar to microtubules and 
microfilaments.  Note  that  in  contrast  to  micro-
tubules  and  actin  ﬁlaments,  which  are  assembled 
from globular proteins with nucleotide-binding and 
hydrolyzing activity, intermediate ﬁlaments consists 
of ﬁlamentous monomers lacking enzymatic activity. 
In contrast to actin and tubulin, the assembly and 
disassembly of intermediate ﬁlament monomers are 
regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphoryla-
tion, respectively. 

Intermediate ﬁlament protein monomers consist of

three domains (see Figure 1-35): A  central (cid:95)-helical 
rod domain is ﬂanked by a nonhelical N-terminal 
head domain and a C-terminal tail domain. 

The assembly of intermediate ﬁlaments occurs in 

four steps:

1.  A  pair  of  ﬁlamentous  monomers  of  variable 
length and amino acid sequence of the head and tail 
domains, form a parallel dimer through their central 
rod domain coiled around each other.

2.  A  tetrameric  unit  is  then  assembled  by  two 
antiparallel half staggered coiled dimers. Therefore, 
in contrast to microtubules and actin ﬁlaments, the 
antiparallel alignment of the initial tetramers deter-
mines a lack of structural polarity of intermediate 
ﬁlament (absence of plus and minus ends). One end 

of an intermediate ﬁlament cannot be distinguished 
from  another.  If  molecular  motors  associate  to  an 
intermediate ﬁlament, they would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to 
identify one direction from another.  

3. Eight tetramers associate laterally to form a 16 

nm-thick unit length ﬁlament (ULF). 

4. Individual ULFs join end-to-end to form a short 
ﬁlaments  that  continue  growing  longitudinally  by 
annealing to other ULFs and existing intermediate 
ﬁlaments. The elongation of the ﬁlament is followed 
by internal compaction to achieve the 10 nm-thick 
intermediate ﬁlament.

The  tight  association  of  dimers,  tetramers  and 
ULFs provide intermediate ﬁlaments with high tensile 
strength  and  resistance  to  stretching,  compression, 
twisting and bending forces.

Intermediate ﬁlaments provide structural strength 
or scaffolding for the attachment of other structures. 
Intermediate  ﬁlaments  form  extensive  cytoplasmic 
networks  extending  from  cage-like  perinuclear  ar-
rangements to the cell surface. 

Intermediate  filaments  of  different  molecular 
classes are characteristic of particular tissues or states 
of differentiation (for example, in the epidermis of 
skin). Five major types of intermediate ﬁlament pro-
teins have been identiﬁed on the basis of sequence 
similarities  in  the  (cid:95)-helical  rod  domain. They  are 
referred  to  as  types  I  through  V  (see  Box  1-M). 
About 50 intermediate ﬁlament proteins have been 
reported so far.

Figure 1-34. Light-chain phosphorylation of myosin II in nonmuscle cells

In skeletal muscle, the regulation of actin-myosin 
interaction is mediated by the binding of Ca2+ to 
troponin. 
   In smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, 
contraction is regulated by the phosphorylation of one 
of the myosin light chains.

Type    I  (acidic  keratins)  and  type  II  (neutral 
to basic keratins). This class of proteins forms the 
intermediate ﬁlament cytoskeleton of epithelial cells 
(called  cytokeratins  to  distinguish  them  from  the 
keratins of hair and nails).  Equal amounts of acidic 
(40 to 60 kd) and neutral-basic (50 to 70 kd) cyto-
keratins combine to form this type of intermediate 

 Box 1-M | Intermediate ﬁlament proteins: Highlights to remember

•  Type I (acidic) and type II (basic)
    Keratins (40-70 kd): Keratins assemble as type I and type II heteropolymers. 
Different keratin types are coexpressed in epithelial cells, hair, and nails. Kera-
tin gene mutations occur in several skin diseases (blistering and epidermolysis 
diseases).

•  Type III (can self-assemble as homopolymers)
   Vimentin (54 kd): Present in mesenchymal-derived cells.
    Desmin (53 kd):  A component of Z disks of striated muscle and smooth 

muscle cells.

    Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP 51 kd): Present in astrocytes.
    Peripherin (57 kd): A component of axons in the peripheral nervous system.
•  Type IV
    Neuroﬁlaments (NF): Three forms coexpressed and forming heteropolymers 

in neurons: NF-L (light, 60 to 70 kd), NF-M (medium, 105 to 110 kd) and NF-H 
(heavy, 135 to 150 kd).

   Lamin A and lamin B (60 to 70 kd, 63-68 kd):  Present in the nuclear lamina as-
sociated to the inner layer of the nuclear envelope. Maintain the integrity of the 
nuclear envelope. A group of human diseases, laminopathies, is associated 
with lamin A gene (LMNA) mutations (see Box 1-N).

ﬁlament protein.  Type I and type II intermediate 
ﬁlament  keratins  form  tonoﬁlaments  associated 
with molecules present in the cytoplasmic plaques 
of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes (see Figures 
1-18 and 1-19). We come back to intermediate ﬁla-
ment–binding proteins, such as ﬁlaggrins, when we 
discuss  the  differentiation  of  keratinocytes  in  the 
epidermis  of  the  skin  (Chapter  11,  Integumentary 
System), and plectin, when we analyze the cytoskeletal 
protective network of skeletal muscle cells (Chapter 
7, Muscle Tissue). 

In the epidermis, the basal cells express keratins 
K5 and K14. The upper differentiating cells express 
keratins K1 and K10. In some  regions of the epider-
mis, such as in the palmoplantar region, keratin K9 is 
found.  Mutations in K5 and K14  cause hereditary 
blistering skin diseases belonging to the clinical type 
epidermolysis  bullosa  simplex  (see  later,  Clinical 
signiﬁcance: Intermediate ﬁlaments and skin blister-
ing diseases).

Type III. This group includes the following inter-

mediate ﬁlament proteins: 

Vimentin  (54  kd)  is  generally  found  in  cells  of 

mesenchymal origin.   

Desmin (53 kd) is a component of skeletal muscle 
cells and is localized to the Z disk of the sarcomere
(see Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue).  This intermediate 
ﬁlament protein keeps individual contractile elements 
of the sarcomeres attached to the Z disk and plays a 
role in coordinating muscle cell contraction. Desmin 

 Box 1-N | Clinical features of laminopathies           

•  Classiﬁed into three distinct categories: muscular dystrophy, partial lipodystro-
phy, and neuropathy. Caused by lamin A or C mutations affecting skeletal and 
cardiac muscle and fat distribution.
•  Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (phenotype inherited by autosomal 
dominant, recessive and X-linked mechanisms, the latter caused by mutations in 
emerin gene):  Achilles tendon contractures, slow and progressive muscle weak-
ness and wasting, cardiomyopathy with conduction defects.  
•  Limb girdle muscular dystrophy: Progressive muscle weakness of hip girdle 
and proximal arm and muscle of the leg. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
•  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder type 2B1: Motor and sensory deﬁcit neuropathy 
distal in the upper limbs and proximal and distal in the lower limbs. Note: X-linked 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease also displays motor and sensory neuropa-
thies of the peripheral nervous system, but is caused by a mutation in the con-
nexin32 (Cx32) gene expressed in Schwann cells. It affects myelin.
• Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy: Becomes evident at puberty with a 
loss of subcutaneous fat from the trunk and limbs and accumulation of fat in the 
face and neck.   

is also found in smooth muscle cells.

Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (51 kd) is 
observed in astrocytes and some Schwann cells (see 
Chapter 8, Nervous Tissue).

Peripherin (57 kd) is a component of neurons of 
the  peripheral  nervous  system  and  is    coexpressed 
with neuroﬁlament proteins (see Chapter 8, Nervous 
Tissue). 

Type  IV.    This  group  includes  neuroﬁlaments, 
nestin, syncoilin and (cid:95)-internexin. Neuroﬁlaments 
are the main components.

Neuroﬁlaments  (NFs)  are  found  in  axons  and 

dendrites  of  neurons. Three  types  of  proteins  can 
be found in a neuroﬁlament: NF-L (60 to 70 kd), 
NF-M (105 to 110 kd), and NF-H (135 to 150 kd), 
for low-molecular-weight, middle-molecular-weight, 
and high-molecular-weight neuroﬁlaments. Abnor-
mal accumulations of neuroﬁlaments (neuroﬁbrillary 
tangles) are a characteristic feature of a number of 
neuropathologic conditions. 

(cid:95)-Internexin (66 kd) is found predominantly in 
the central nervous system (particularly in the  spinal 
cord and optic nerve). 

Type V. Proteins of this group, the nuclear lamins, 
are encoded by three genes: LMNA, LMNB1, and 
LMNB2. 

Lamin A and lamin C arise from the alternative 
splicing of transcripts encoded by the LMNA gene. 
The LMNB1 gene encodes lamin B1 expressed in all 
somatic cells. The LMNB2 gene encodes lamin B2, 
expressed in all somatic cells, and lamin B3, that is 
speciﬁc for spermatogenic cells. 

Nuclear lamins (60 to 75 kd) differ from the other 
intermediate ﬁlament proteins in that they organize 
an  orthogonal  meshwork, the  nuclear  lamina, in 
association with the inner membrane of the nuclear 
envelope.  

Lamins provide mechanical support for the nuclear 
envelope and bind chromatin. Because of their clini-
cal relevance, we come back to nuclear lamins and 
associated proteins when we discuss the organization 
of the nuclear envelope.

A group of human diseases, known as laminopa-
thies, are linked to defects in proteins of the nuclear 
envelope, including lamins (see Box 1-N). Numerous 
laminopathies    affect  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle, 
adipose  tissue  (lipodystrophies),  and  motor    and 
sensory peripheral nerves. 

Two hypotheses concerning the pathogenic mecha-

nism of laminopathies have been considered: 

1. The gene expression hypothesis regards lamin A 

and lamin C as essential for the correct tissue-speciﬁc 
expression of certain genes. 

2. The mechanical stress hypothesis proposes that a 
defect in lamin A and lamin C weakens the structural 
integrity of the nuclear envelope. 

During  mitosis,  the  phosphorylation  of    lamin 
serine residues causes a transient disassembly of the 
meshwork, followed by a breakdown of the nuclear 
envelope into small fragments.  At the end of mi-
tosis, lamins are dephosphorylated, and the lamin 
meshwork and the nuclear envelope reorganize. See 
the cell nucleus section concerning the mechanism 
of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of lamins 
during the cell cycle.

Hemidesmosomes and intermediate ﬁlaments
Hemidesmosomes are specialized junctions observed 
in basal cells of the stratiﬁed squamous epithelium 
attaching to the basement membrane (Figure 1-36). 
Inside  the  cell,  the  proteins  BPAG1  (for  bullous 
pemphigoid antigen 1) and plectin (members of the 
plakin family of cross-linker proteins) are associated 
to intermediate ﬁlaments (also called tonoﬁlaments). 
Plectin connects intermediate ﬁlaments to the inte-
grin subunit (cid:96)4.

On the extracellular side, integrin (cid:95)6(cid:96)4, BPAG2
(for  bullous  pemphigoid  antigen  2)  and  laminin 
5, a protein present in specialized structures called 
anchoring  ﬁlaments,  link  hemidesmosomes  to  the 
basal lamina.

intermediate filament proteins.
   
   Mutations of emerin, which binds to both lamins 
A and B, and lamin B receptor, which binds to 
lamin B, give rise to Emery-Dreifuss muscular 
dystrophy and Pelger-Huet anomaly in blood 
granulocytes (incomplete differentiation).  

Homozygous mutation in lamin B receptor causes 
Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, an embryonic 
lethal chondrodystrophy.

The  plakin-related  protein  BPAG1  associates  to 
BPAG2, a transmembrane protein with an extracel-
lular collagenous domain.  

Putting all things together, BPAG1 constitutes a 
bridge between the transmembrane protein BPAG2 
and intermediate ﬁlaments. If this bridge is disrupted, 
as in bullous pemphigoid, the epidermis becomes de-
tached from the basal lamina anchoring sites. BPAG1 
and BPAG2 were discovered in patients with bullous 
pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Skin blistering diseases
Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering 
disease similar to pemphigus vulgaris (called “pem-
phigoid”,  similar  to  pemphigus).  Blisters  or  bullae 
develop  at  the  epidermis-dermis  junction  when 
circulating  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  cross-reacts 
with bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 or 2. IgG-antigen 
complexes lead to the formation of complement com-
plexes (C3, C5b, and C9), which damage the attach-
ment of hemidesmosomes and perturb the synthesis

 Box 1-O | Nuclear lamina: Highlights to remember      

•  Lamins, type V intermediate ﬁlament proteins, are the main components of the 
nuclear lamina. 
•  Lamins bind to proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, including emerin (with 
eight transmembrane spans), lamin B receptor, lamina-associated polypeptides 
1 and 2(cid:96)(cid:11)(cid:3)and nesprin-1(cid:95), a protein with several spectrin-like repeats that binds 
lamin A and emerin (see Figure 1-39). 
•  Lamins and their associated proteins have roles in chromatin organization, 
spacing of nuclear pore complexes, and reassembly of the nucleus after cell 
division.
•  Mutations of lamins and lamin-binding proteins cause various diseases (called 
laminopathies)  (see Box 1-N). Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (prema-
ture aging) is caused by a mutation in lamin A.  

of anchoring proteins by basal cells (Figure 1-37).

The  production  of  local  toxins  causes  the  de-
granulation of mast cells and release of chemotactic 
factors attracting eosinophils. Enzymes released by 
eosinophils cause blisters or bullae.

Intermediate  filaments  strengthen  the  cellular 
cytoskeleton. The  expression  of  mutant  keratin 
genes  results  in  the abnormal  assembly  of  keratin 
ﬁlaments, which weakens the mechanical strength 
of cells and causes inherited skin diseases, as shown 
in Figure 1-38: 

1. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), charac-
terized by skin blisters after minor  trauma. EBS is 
determined by keratin 5 and 14 mutant genes. 

2. Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EH), in which 
patients have excessive keratinization of the epidermis 
owing to mutations of keratin 1 and 10 genes. 

3.  Epidermolytic  plantopalmar  keratoderma 
(EPPK), a skin disease producing fragmentation of 
the  epidermis  of  the  palms  and  soles,  caused  by  a 
mutation of the keratin 9 gene.

Figure 1-40. Ran GTPase directs nucleocytoplasmic transport

Basic concepts: (1) Ran exists in GTP- and GDP-bound forms that interact 
differently with proteins. (2) A gradient in Ran-GTP/Ran-GDP concentration across 
the nuclear envelope controls the directional transport of many proteins across the 
nuclear pores. (3) Conversion between these forms and the assembly/disassembly 
of protein complexes require regulatory proteins.

1. The nuclear envelope.
2. Chromatin.
3. The nucleolus. 
The nuclear envelope consists of two concentric 
membranes separated by a perinuclear space. The in-
ner nuclear membrane is associated with the nuclear 
lamina (see Box 1-O), chromatin, and ribonucleo-
proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous 
with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum 
and can be associated with ribosomes.

The nuclear pore complex has a tripartite struc-
ture, composed of a central cylindrical body placed 
between inner and outer octagonal rings, each con-
sisting of eight protein particles. The central cylinder 
consists of a central plug and eight radiating spokes 
(Figure 1-39). The exact role of individual nuclear 
pore  complex  proteins  in  nucleocytoplasmic  traf-
ﬁcking is unclear.

Drumstick in 
a neutrophil 

Barr body in scrapped 

cells of the oral 

epithelium

Dosage compensation

The inactive X chromosome remains condensed during most of the interphase 
of the cell cycle.
    It is visualized as a densely stained chromatin mass (Barr body or X 
chromatin) in a variable number of nuclei (about 30%-80%) of a normal female. 
A small drumstick is observed in 1% to 10% of neutrophils in the female.
   The inactivation of one of the X chromosomes is random (paternal or 
maternal X chromosome).
   If a cell has more than two X chromosomes, the extra ones are inactivated 
and the maximum number of Barr bodies per nucleus will be one less than the 
total number of X chromosomes in the karyotype. 

Nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear 
envelope establish bidirectional communication gates 
for  the  trafﬁcking  of  macromolecules  between  the 
cytoplasm  and  the  nucleus.    Small  molecules  (less 
than 40 to 60 kd) can diffuse passively through the 
nuclear pore complex. Proteins of any size, containing 
a nuclear localization amino acid sequence (NLS, 
Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val),  can  be  imported 
into the nucleus, however, by an energy-dependent 
mechanism (requiring ATP and GTP). 

Nucleocytoplasmic transport: Ran-GTPase  
Protein nuclear import/export is controlled by Ran 
(for  Ras-like  nuclear  GTPase),  a  small  GTPase  of 
the Ras superfamily that dictates the directionality 
of nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Ran  shuttles  across  the  nuclear  pores  and  accu-
mulates  inside  the  nucleus  by  an  active  transport 
mechanism (Figure 1-40).

1. In the nucleus, a high concentration of Ran-
GTP  is achieved by RCC1, a GDP-GTP exchanger 
protein bound to chromatin. Ran-GTP determines 
the dissociation of imported proteins containing NLS
by binding to importin (cid:96), the transporter receptor 
protein. 

2. In the opposite direction, from the nucleus to 
the cytoplasm, binding of Ran-GTP to the carrier 
protein  exportin/Crm1  facilitates  the  assembly  of 
complexes containing proteins with nuclear export 
sequence (NES). 

3.  In  the  cytoplasm,  Ran-GTP  is  converted  to 
Ran-GDP  by  Ran-GTPase,  which  is  activated  by 
two cooperating proteins: Ran-GAP (Ran-GTPase-
activating protein) and RanBP (Ran-GTP binding 
protein). Consequently, the exported protein is disso-
ciated from its transporter receptor protein exportin/
Crm1  and  Ran-GTP.  Importin  and  exportins  are 
recycled  by  transport  back  across  the  nuclear  pore 
complex.

Chromatin
Chromatin is deﬁned as particles or “beads” (called 
nucleosomes)  on  a  double-  stranded  DNA  string 
(Figure 1-41).  Each nucleosome consists of a histone 
octamer core and about two turns of DNA wound 
around the histone core.  The histone octamer con-
tains two molecules each of  H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 
histones. H1 histone cross-links the DNA molecule 
wrapped around the octamer.

Chromatin is packed in separate chromosomes that 
can be visualized during mitosis (or meiosis). During 
interphase (phases G1, S, and G2 of the cell cycle), 
individual chromosomes cannot be identiﬁed as such, 
but are present in a diffuse or noncondensed state.  
Diffuse  chromatin,  called  euchromatin  (“good 
chromatin”),  is  transcriptionally  (RNA  synthesis) 
active and represents about 10% of total chromatin.

Figure 1-43. Components of the nucleus and nucleolus

The nucleus of eukaryotic cells is separated from the 
cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope, a double concentric 
membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. 
The nuclear envelope is interrupted at random intervals 
by nuclear pore complexes, nucleoporin-containing 
structures that regulate the passage of molecules 
between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

Nucleolar proteins nucleolin and fibrillarin are found in 
the dense fibrillar component. Nucleostemin is present in 
the granular component. RNA polymerase I occupies the 
fibrillar center.

(“different  chromatin”),  is  transcriptionally  inac-
tive  and  represents  about  90%  of  total  chromatin 
(Figure 1-42). 

Dosage compensation: X chromosome inactivation
X  chromosome  inactivation,  known  as  dosage 
compensation,  starts  early  in  embryonic  stem  cell 
differentiation and is characterized by four features:
1. All but one of the X chromosomes undergoes 

inactivation.

2. The choice of the inactivated X chromosome 
is  random.  Either  the  paternal  or  the  maternal  X 
chromosome is inactivated.  

3. The inactivation processes is heritable through 
subsequent rounds of cell division. The choice re-
mains nonrandom for all subsequent cell descendants. 
4. Both X chromosomes in oocytes remain active. 
The transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X 
chromosomes is observed in the trophoblast  on day 
12 after fertilization and on day 16 in the embryo.

In  humans,  the  inactivated  X  chromosome  is 
recognized  by  the  presence  of  the  Barr  body,  a

 Box 1-P | Nucleolus: Highlights to remember

•  The nucleolus is the site of synthesis, processing, and modiﬁcation of pre-
rRNA and initial preribosomal assembly.  It also houses proteins unrelated to 
ribosome synthesis and shuttling between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm 
to serve speciﬁc functions.
•  The nucleolus consists of three components: (1) ﬁbrillar centers; (2) a dense 
ﬁbrillar component surrounding the ﬁbrillar centers; and (3) a granular compo-
nent. Pre-rRNA synthesis occurs at the interface between the ﬁbrillar centers 
and the surrounding dense ﬁbrillar component.  Nascent pre-rRNA transcripts 
extend into the dense ﬁbrillar component and migrate to the granular compo-
nent where processing, modiﬁcation, and preribosomal assembly occur.
•  The ﬁbrillar centers contain chromatin and transcription factors, including 
RNA polymerase I.  The dense ﬁbrillar component, the site of initial pre-rRNA 
processing, contains small ribonucleoproteins involved in RNA modiﬁcation. 
The granular component accounts for about 75% of the nucleolar mass; the 
granules correspond to preribosomes.
•  The nucleolus disappears during mitotic prophase and reassembles at the 
end of telophase at speciﬁc chromosomal regions named nucleolar-organizer 
regions (NORs).    

gastrin-releasing peptide receptor is associated with 
an increased risk in lung cancer in women. We come 
back to X-linked dominant and recessive inheritance 
at the end of this chapter.

Nucleolus
The nucleolus is the site of  synthesis and process-
ing  of  ribosomal  RNA  (rRNA)  and  assembly  of 
ribosomal subunits. The rRNA genes are arranged 
in an array of multiple copies transcribed by RNA 
polymerase I. 

The nucleolus houses several proteins, including 
ﬁbrillarin  and    nucleolin,  required  for  pre-rRNA 
processing. In addition, the nucleolus contains nucle-
ostemin, a protein unrelated to ribosomal biogenesis. 
Nucleolin and nucleostemin are shuttling proteins; 

Box 1-Q | PAS and Feulgen reactions

•  Both reactions use the Schiff reagent.
•  In the PAS reaction, periodic acid forms aldehyde groups in sugars of glyco-
proteins by an oxidation process.
•  In the Feulgen reaction, hydrochloric acid forms aldehyde groups in deoxy-
ribose by hydrolysis.

Box 1-R | Basophilia and acidophilia 

Many cytologic stains use acidic and basic dyes.
•  Basic or cationic dyes have positively charged color radicals forming elec-
trostatic linkages with acidic groups (e.g., phosphate groups in nucleic acids).  
Toluidine blue is a cationic dye that binds to phosphate groups in DNA and 
RNA to give a blue color. DNA and RNA are considered to be basophilic (having 
binding afﬁnity for a basic dye).
•  Acidic or anionic dyes have negatively charged color radicals establishing 
electrostatic linkages with basic groups. Eosin is an anionic dye that stains many 
basic proteins. Basic proteins are considered to be acidophilic (having afﬁnity 
for an acidic dye).

they relocalize from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm 
where  they  interact  with  protein  p53,  a  protector 
of DNA damage by preventing DNA replication in 
response  to  genomic  stress. We  come  back  to  p53 
later (see Figure 1-52). 

Essentially,  the  nucleolus  is  a  multifunctional 
nuclear  structure  consisting  of  stable  proteins  in-
volved in ribosomal synthesis and molecules shuttling 
between  the  nucleolus  and  nucleoplasm  to  fulﬁll 
non-nucleolar functions. 

 Structurally, the nucleolus consists of three major 

components (Figure 1-43; see Box 1-P): 

1. A ﬁbrillar center (corresponding to chromatin 
containing repeated rRNA genes and the presence of 
RNA polymerase I and signal recognition particle 
[SRP] RNA). 

2.  A  dense  ﬁbrillar  component  (where  nascent 
rRNA  is  present  and  undergoing  some  of  its  pro-
cessing). Fibrillarin and nucleolin are found in the 
ﬁbrillar dense component.

3. A granular component (where the assembly of 
ribosomal  subunits, containing  18S  rRNA    [small 
subunit] and 28S rRNA [large subunit], is complet-
ed). Nucleostemin, a protein unrelated to ribosomal 
biogenesis, coexists with the granular components. 
Nucleoli  are  typically  surrounded  by  a  shell  of 
heterochromatin,  mostly  from  centromeric  and 
pericentromeric chromosomal regions.  

The nucleolus dissociates during mitosis, then reap-
pears at the beginning of the G1 phase.  More than 
one nucleolar mass, each representing the product of 
a chromosome with a nucleolar organizing region 
(NOR), can be observed in the nucleus.  In some 
cells with an extended interphase, such as neurons, 
a single large nucleolus is organized by the fusion of 
several nucleolar masses.

The active process of rRNA synthesis can be visual-
ized at the electron microscopic level (Figure 1-44) 
by  spreading  the  contents  of  nuclei  of  cells  with 
hundreds of nucleoli (e.g., amphibian oocytes). rRNA 
genes can be seen as repeating gene units along the 
chromatin axis, like “Christmas trees,” pointing in 
the same direction and separated by nontranscribed 
spacers. The entire rRNA gene region is covered by 
more than 100 RNA polymerase I molecules syn-
thesizing an equivalent number of ﬁbrils, each with 
a terminal granule.  

Each ﬁbril represents an rRNA precursor (45S) 
ribonucleoprotein  molecule  oriented  perpendicu-
larly to the chromatin axis similar to the branches of 
a tree. The 45S  rRNA precursor is detached from 
the chromatin axis and cleaved into 28S, 18S, and 
5.8S rRNAs. 

The 18S rRNA and associated proteins form the 
small ribosomal subunit. The 28S and 5.8S, together 
with 5S rRNA made outside the nucleolus, and as-
sociated proteins form the large ribosomal subunit.

Cell division in eukaryotic cells: the nuclear 

cycle and centrosome cycle  
  

The cell cycle is divided into four phases: G1 (gap 
1), S, G2 (gap 2), and mitosis. Mitosis is followed in 
most cases by cytokinesis. DNA replication occurs 
during the S phase  and can be detected by 
autoradiography using [3H]thymidine as a labeled  
precursor.
   The duration of the phases of the cell cycle 
varies.  The mitotic phase is the shortest (about 1 
hour for a total cycle time of 24 hours). The G1 
phase is the longest (about 11 hours). The S phase 
is completed within 8 hours; G2 in about 4 hours.
   Some cells stop cell division or divide 
occasionally to replace cells lost by injury or cell 
death. These cells leave  the G1 phase of the cell 
cycle and become quiescent by entering the 
so-called G0 phase. Although G0 cells are 
metabolically active, they have lost their 
proliferation potential unless appropriate 
extracellular signals enable their reentry to the cell 
cycle.

The mRNA precursor is transcribed by RNA poly-
merase II, and the tRNA precursor is transcribed by 
RNA polymerase III.

Localization of nucleic acids
Cytochemistry and autoradiography (Figure 1-45) 
provide information about the cellular distribution 
and synthesis of nucleic acids. The Feulgen reaction 
is speciﬁc for the localization of DNA (see Box 1-Q). 

Box 1-T | Cell cycle: Highlights to remember

• Cell division requires the coordination of three cycles: cytoplasmic cycle, nuclear 
cycle, and centrosome cycle. The centrosome cycle plays a role in regulating the 
cytoplasmic and nuclear cycles. 
• The cytoplasmic cycle depends on the availability of cyclins activated and de-
activated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks).  Cdk inhibitors inactivate Cdk-cyclin 
complexes. Cdk inhibitors are up-regulated at the transcriptional level to arrest, if 
necessary, the cytoplasmic and nuclear cycle.
• The nuclear cycle involves DNA duplication and chromosomal condensation. 
Cdk2 phosphorylation of a protein complex bound to the origin of DNA replication 
recruits DNA polymerase to initiate and complete DNA synthesis in S-phase. Cdk1 
phosphorylation  triggers  chromosomal  condensation  (mediated  by  histone H3 
phosphorylation) and breakdown of the nuclear envelope (determined by nuclear 
lamin phosphorylation).
•  During the centrosome cycle, the two centrioles of a centrosome duplicate dur-
ing S-phase after phosphorylation of centrosome substrates by Cdk2.  Daughter 
centrioles derive from each centriole.
• Cdks are involved in the coordination of the cytoplasmic, nuclear, and centrosome 
cycles. 
• Cdk2 activity is required to initiate DNA replication and centriolar duplication.

Basic dyes, such as toluidine blue, stain DNA and 
RNA (see Box 1-R). Pretreatment with  deoxyribo-
nuclease (DNAse) and ribonuclease (RNAse) deﬁnes 
the distribution sites of DNA and RNA by selective 
removal of one of the nucleic acids. 

Box 1-S provides basic information about the most 
frequently cytochemical techniques used in Histology 
and Pathology.

Autoradiography and radiolabeled precursors for 
one of the nucleic acids can determine the timing of 
their synthesis. In this technique, a radioactive precur-
sor of DNA ([3H]thymidine) or RNA  ([3H]uridine) 
is exposed to living cells. As a result of exposure to the 
radiolabel, any synthesized DNA or RNA contains 
the precursor. The radioactivity is detected by coating 
the cells with a thin layer of a photographic emulsion. 
Silver-containing crystals of the emulsion are exposed 
to structures of the cell containing radioactive DNA 
or RNA. After development of the emulsion, silver 
grains indicate the location of the labeled structures. 
This approach has been used extensively for determin-
ing the duration of several phases of the cell cycle.

Cell cycle
The cell cycle is deﬁned as the interval between two 
successive mitotic divisions resulting in the produc-
tion of two daughter cells (Figure 1-46).  

The  cell  cycle  is  traditionally  divided  into  two 

major phases:

Cell cycle events occur by 
complex combinations of 
cyclin-dependent kinases 
(Cdks) and cyclins in 
different phases of the cell 
cycle, which in turn provide 
additional control to the cell 
cycle machinery.

1. Interphase.
2. Mitosis (also known as the M  phase).
The  most  relevant  event  of  interphase  is  the  S 
phase, when the DNA in the nucleus is replicated.  S 
phase is preceded by an interval or gap called the G1 
phase.  The beginning of mitosis is preceded by the 
G2 phase, a phase in which the cell ensures that  DNA 
replication is completed before starting the M phase.  
Essentially, G1 and G2  phases provide time for cell 
growth before and after DNA synthesis.  Cell growth 
is required for doubling the cell mass in preparation 
for cell division.  

Cells in G1 can make a commitment to DNA repli-
cation and enter the S phase or stop their progression 
into the following S phase.   If  a cell does not enter 
the S phase, it remains in a resting state known as 
G0, where it can remain for days, months, or years 
before reentering the cell cycle. 

In a more contemporary view, the cycle is regarded 
as  the  coordinated  progression  and  completion  of 
three separate cycles: 

1. A cytoplasmic cycle, consisting of the sequential 
activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases in the 
presence of cyclins. 

2. A nuclear cycle, in which DNA is replicated 
and chromosomes condense in preparation for cell 
division.

3.  A  centrosome  cycle,  consisting  of  the  dupli-
cation  of  the  two  centrioles,  called  mother  and 
daughter centrioles, and assembly of  pericentriolar 

proteins in preparation for the organization of the 
mitotic spindle curing mitosis or meiosis (see Figure 
1-46).  Recall  from  our  previous  discussion  on  the 
centrosome as a microtubule organizing center that  
(cid:97)-tubulin ring complexes are microtubule-nucleating 
complexes interacting with the protein pericentrin
in  the  pericentriolar  material.  If  this  interaction  is 
disrupted, the cell cycle is arrested during the G2-M 
phase transition, and the cell undergoes programmed 
cell death or apoptosis. Basal bodies,  the origin site 
of cilia and ﬂagella, derive from centrosomes.

 The activities of cyclin-dependent protein kinases–
cyclin complexes coordinate the timed progression 
of  the  nuclear  and  centrosome  cycles.  Figure  1-47 
provides additional details. 

Autoradiography and FACS 
The various phases of the cell cycle can be studied 
by  autoradiography.  Cells  in  the  S  phase  can  be 
recognized by detecting the synthesis of DNA using 
[3H]thymidine as a radiolabeled precursor. Cells can 
be stained through the developed emulsion layer to 
determine the precise localization sites of the overlap-
ping silver grains.

The time progression of cells through the differ-
ent phases of the cell cycle can be estimated using 
both  brief  and  prolonged  [3H]thymidine  pulses.  
The number of cells radiolabeled during interphase 
(generally about 30%) represent the labeling index of 
the S phase.  The fraction of radiolabeled cells seen in

Cells are stained with a  ﬂuorescent dye, which binds 
to DNA.  The amount of ﬂuorescence detected by 
the FACS is equivalent to the amount of DNA in 
each cell (for example, 2C in G1; 4C at the end of S 
phase; 4C during G2).

Breakdown and reassembly of the nuclear 
envelope
The  disassembly  of  the  nuclear  envelope  occurs  at 
the end of the mitotic and meiotic prophase. It in-
volves the fragmentation of the nuclear envelope, the 
dissociation of the nuclear pore complexes, and the 
depolymerization of the nuclear lamina (Figure 1-48).
The nuclear lamina is composed of type V inter-
mediate ﬁlament proteins, lamins A, B, and C, which 
associate with each other to form the nuclear lamina. 
Phosphorylation  of  lamins,  catalyzed  first  by 
protein  kinase  C  and  later  by  cyclin  A–activated 
Cdk1 kinase, results in the disassembly of the nuclear 
lamina. In addition, the components of the nuclear 
pore complex, the nucleoporins, and the membranous 
cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum also disperse. 
The endoplasmic reticulum is the nuclear membrane 
reservoir for nuclear envelope reassembly.

During  anaphase,  nucleoporins  and  three  trans-
membrane protein components of the inner nuclear 
membrane, lamina-associated polypeptide 2(cid:96), lamin 
B receptor, and emerin, attach to the surface of the 
chromosomes  (chromatin). Then,  cisternae  of  the 
endoplasmic reticulum are recruited by nucleoporins 
and inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the nuclear 
envelope is rebuilt by the end of telophase. 

A ﬁnal step in the reconstruction of the nuclear 
envelope  is  the  dephosphorylation  of  lamin  B  by 
protein phosphatase 1. Dephosphorylated lamin B 
associates with lamins A and C to form the nuclear 
lamina before cytokinesis. 

This  sequence  of  events  stresses  the  impact  of 
gene mutations affecting the expression of lamin A 
or lamin-binding proteins (see Box 1-N) as causes of 
laminopathies.

Tumor-suppressor genes: The retinoblastoma 
model 
Not only Cdk-cyclin complexes control the progress-
sion and completion of the cell cycle. Tissues use two 
strategies to restrict cell proliferation: 

1. By limiting mitogenic factors, such as  platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF) and ﬁbroblast-growth 
factor (FGF), which stimulate cell growth.

2. By regulatory genes that actively suppress prolif-
eration. These genes, called suppressor genes, control 
normal cell proliferation.

The  retinoblastoma  model  provides  important 
clues on how suppressor genes work  (Figure 1-49). 
Each cell has  duplicate copies of the retinoblastoma

      The telomerase complex is assembled in Cajal bodies in the nucleus and

is shuttled to the telomeres by the accessory protein TCAB1.

      The ATPases pontin and reptin activate the telomeric complex at the 
2
chromosome ends and initiate nucleotide addition. By this mechanism, the 
telomeric complex compensates for the shortening of telomeres, maintaining 
telomere length and stability. Telomere stability is essential for the highly 
proliferative stem cells. A complex of six proteins, called shelterin, regulates 
the length of the telomere (not shown).

(Rb) gene as a safety backup. When the two copies 
of the Rb gene are mutated, an abnormal Rb protein
induces  cancerous growth of retinal cells.  

When a single copy of the Rb gene pair is mutated, 
the  remaining  Rb  gene  copy  functions  normally 
and suppresses unregulated cell proliferation unless 
a second mutation occurs. In children with only a 
single intact Rb gene copy, all cells of the develop-
ing embryo grow normally. Late in gestation, retinal 
cells may lose the normal copy of the Rb gene, and a 
retinoblastoma develops.  

The Rb gene speciﬁes a nuclear protein involved 
in regulating the activity of a group of proteins, tran-
scription factors, involved in DNA synthesis and cell 
cycle progression. When Rb protein is dephosphory-
lated, it binds to transcription factors. Although the 
Rb protein–transcription factor complex can bind to 
target genes, the activity of the transcription factors 
is repressed. 

When Rb protein is phosphorylated by the Cdk4–
cyclin D complex, it dissociates from the transcrip-
tion  factor  complex,  which  activates  speciﬁc  gene 
expression (Figure 1-50). Phosphorylated Rb protein 
switches  transcription  factors  from  suppression  to 
activation required for DNA synthesis and progres-
sion of the cell cycle.

MOC

Centrosome (mitotic center)

Prophase
1. Opposite centrosomes (each consisting of a pair of centrioles embedded in proteins of the 
microtubular organizing center, MOC) initiate the assembly of the mitotic spindle.
2. The nuclear envelope breaks down when lamins phosphorylate.
   
3. Replicated chromosomes condense. Each chromosome consists of two identical  
chromatids (called sister chromatids) held together at the centromere or primary  
 
constriction of the chromosome.  A chromatin-binding protein, called cohesin, links sister 
chromatids to each other. Condensin at the periphery of the chromatids compacts chromatin. 

Kinetochore microtubule
Polar microtubule

Mitotic spindle

Metaphase
1. The kinetochore develops at the centromeric region. The kinetochore is a structural 
specialization of the surface of the chromosome into which microtubules insert.  Microtubules 
extending from the centrosome to the kinetochore are kinetochore microtubules.
2. Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate (also called the metaphase plate).
3. Microtubules extending from one cell pole to the other are polar microtubules.  Radiating 
microtubules project from the centrosome. They are not attached to the kinetochore.
4. During the metaphase, two opposing but balanced forces maintain the chromosomes at the 
equatorial plate. Kinetochore microtubules pull chromosomes toward one of the poles; 
radiating microtubules stabilize the centrosome by anchoring to the plasma membrane.
5.  The anaphase-promoting complex (APC), disassembles when the attachment of 
kinetochore microtubules to the kinetochore is correct. If the kinetochore is not attached to the 
microtubules, the APC arrests the mitotic cycle at the metaphase by delaying cyclin activity.

Anaphase

1. Sister chromatids separate by the synchronous detachment of the centromeres.
2. Topoisomerase, an enzyme present in the kinetochore region, frees entangled chromatin 
fibers to facilitate the separation of the sister chromatids.
3. Chromatids are pulled to opposite poles by two independent but coincidental processes: (1) 
The kinetochore microtubules shorten and chromatids move away from the equatorial plane 
toward their respective poles. This step is usually referred to as anaphase A. (2) The cell poles 
separate by the elongation of the polar microtubules. This step is known as anaphase B.
4. Aneuploidy (abnormal chromosomal number) can result from improper allocation of the two 
chromatids of a chromosome to the two daughter cells. Failure of the kinetochore microtubules 
to attach to the kinetochore can block the onset of anaphase. A checkpoint mechanism 
operates at the kinetochore to prevent aneuploidy.

Telophase

1. The nuclear envelope gradually reforms; lamins dephosphorylate and assemble the 
nuclear lamina.
2. Chromosomes decondense.
3.  A transient contractile ring, composed of actin and myosin, develops during cytokinesis 
around the equatorial region and contracts to separate the two daughter cells by a process 
called abscission (from Latin abscindo, to cut away from).  
4. Residual microtubules can be found in the core of the contractile ring. They form a structure 
known as the midbody.
5. Radiating, kinetochore, and polar microtubules disappear.

Box 1-U | p53: Highlights to remember

• The tumor-suppressor protein p53 protects the integrity of DNA in response to 
harmful stress, called genotoxic stress. 
• The protective function depends on the ability of p53 to induce programmed cell 
death or apoptosis or arrest cell cycle activities, when a cell undergoes genotoxic 
stress.
• How does p53 work? As a transcription factor, p53 controls the transcriptional 
activation of proapoptotic genes and the inactivation of antiapoptotic genes.  By 
this mechanism, a cell affected by genotoxic stress is eliminated.
•  What can go wrong? A loss of p53 function may occur by a mutation of the TP53 
gene, which encodes p53, or by an abnormal signaling pathway controlling p53 
function (see Figure 1-52). 
•  Why is p53 important? Cancer cells are highly sensitive to apoptotic signals, but 
can survive if there is a loss of p53 function. 

 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Retinoblastoma tumors
Retinoblastoma,  a  tumor  that  occurs  early  in  life, 
arises as a consequence of mutations in Rb1 gene, 
which encodes the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor 
protein Rb. 

Children with the familial form of retinoblastoma 
usually have multiple tumor sites growing in both 
eyes.   

A  second  type  of  retinoblastoma,  the  sporadic 
form, is seen in children whose parents have no histo-
ry of the disease. Once cured, these patients, as adults, 
do not transmit the disease to the next generation. 
Children with the sporadic retinoblastoma are geneti-
cally normal at fertilization, but during embryonic 
development two somatic mutations occur in a cell 
lineage, giving rise to the cone photoreceptor precur-
sor of the retina. The resulting double-mutated Rb 
genes induce cone photoreceptor precursor cells to 
proliferate into a retinoblastoma. 
   In familial retinoblastoma, the fertilized egg already 
carries a single mutant Rb gene, acquired from the 
sperm or egg. All cells derived from the zygote carry 
this mutation, including the cells of the retina. The 
remaining normal Rb gene must undergo a mutation 
to reach the double-mutated condition required for 
tumor formation. 

Retinoblastoma is only one of several tumors that 
arise  through  loss  or  inactivation  of  critical  genes. 
Wilms’ tumor of the kidney is caused by the loss of 

Box 1-V | Li-Fraumeni syndrome

•  Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized 
by a predisposition to cancer.
•  Several types of cancer develop in a young individual (younger than 45 years 
old): brain tumors, breast tumors (40% of the tumors in females), acute leukemia, 
and soft tissue and bone sarcomas.
•  LFS syndrome is caused by a mutation of the tumor-suppressor gene encoding 
p53, a transcription factor with a cell cycle regulatory function.
•  The incidence of LFS is low. Although the initial cancer can be successfully treated 
in affected children, there is a signiﬁcant risk in the subsequent development of a 
second primary malignant tumor.

a growth-regulating gene, called WT-1.  Similar to 
the Rb gene, both copies must be mutated before a 
cell begins to grow out of control.  

One suppressor gene that does not ﬁt easily into 
this model is p53, the most frequently mutated gene 
in  human  tumors  (leukemias,  lymphomas,  brain 
tumors, and breast cancer, among others).  The p53 
gene encodes the p53 protein, a tetramer that binds 
to a speciﬁc sequence of DNA involved in the tran-
scriptional control of certain genes. 

A mutation that affects one of the four subunits of 
p53 may compromise the function of the remaining 
three subunits.  In contrast to the mutations that af-
fect most other suppressor genes by knocking out gene 
function completely, the p53 mutations can result in 
either mild or aggressive growth. We discuss below 
details of p53 functional regulation.

In  Chapter  16,  Lower  Digestive  Segment,  we 
study  the tumor-suppressor adenomatous polyposis 
coli  (APC)  gene  responsible  for  a  hereditary  form 
of  colon  cancer  (familial  adenomatous  polyposis) 
derived from the malignant transformation of some 
of  the  many  polyps  (benign  tumors)  observed  in 
individuals affected by this condition.

Telomerase: Aging, senescence, and cancer
Somatic cells can undergo a limited number of cell 
divisions, after which they enter a state of senescence. 
In contrast, tumor cells have an unlimited life span 
required for the formation of a tumor. In vitro stud-
ies using cultured cells have provided a model for the 
study of the biological clock of normal somatic cells.
The loss of telomeres represent a sort of molecu-
lar clock that appears to drive aging. The telomeres 
are  the  ends  of  chromosomes  formed  by  a  stretch 
of repeated nucleotide sequences (see Figure 1-51). 
Telomeres are responsible for maintaining chromo-
somal integrity and represent the cellular biological 
clock.  When  DNA  polymerases  fail  to  copy  the 
chromosomal ends, telomeres decrease in size with 
every cell division. Cellular senescence occurs when 
the telomeres shorten to a point at which the integrity 
of a chromosome cannot be maintained. 

The length of the telomeres in male and female 
germinal cells and hematopoietic stem cells is pro-
tected by the enzyme telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein 
with reverse transcriptase activity that uses an RNA 
template  to  maintain  the  length  of  the  telomeres. 
Telomerase is not present in somatic cells.

Most tumor cells express high levels of telomerase. 
The telomerase complex (see Figure 1-51) consists 
of  the  catalytic  telomerase  reverse  transcriptase 
(TERT), the RNA subunit telomerase template RNA 
(TR),  which  provides  the  template  for  repeat  syn-
thesis of chromosome ends, and dyskerin (DKC1), 
an auxiliary protein.  This complex is assembled in 
Cajal  bodies  in  the  nucleus  and  is  transported  to

the  telomeres  by  an  accessory  protein,  telomerase 
Cajal  protein  1  (TCAB1). Two  ATPases,  pontin 
and reptin, activate the telomerase complex at the 
chromosomal end and initiate nucleotide addition. 
Telomere dysfunction has been directly implicated 
in  two  diseases:  dyskeratosis  congenita  and  idio-
pathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis. Dyskeratosis congenita 
is characterized by bone marrow failure, abnormal 
skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia 
(patches of keratosis on the tongue and the inside of 
the cheeks). Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis leads to 
the progressive destruction of the lung tissue with a 
fatal outcome. Short telomeres are observed in both 
diseases.

Senescence appears to be triggered by more than a 
single mechanism. The accumulation of damage and 
stress in cells is the consequence of additive factors de-
rived from shorter telomeres, reactive oxygen species 
and mitochondrial dysfunction. The dysfunction of 
the tumor suppressive retinoblastoma pathway, that 
we have already discussed, and the tumor suppressive 
p53 signaling pathway, that we are describing below, 
added to an unstable telomerase pathway, may push 
cells towards senescence or malignancy.

Clinical signiﬁcance: The p53 signaling pathway  
p53 is a critical transcriptional activator of numerous 
target genes (see Box 1-U). Its role, as a cellular stress 
sensor, is to respond to DNA damage, oxidative stress 
and ischemia by controlling apoptosis  through tran-
scription-dependent and transcription independent 
(mitochondrial dysfunction) mechanisms leading to 
cell cycle arrest or limit cell damage. 

Autophagy, necrosis and apoptosis are three distinct 
forms of cell death following acute cell injury (for 
example, ischemia/reperfusion injury and oxidative 
damage occurring in cerebral stroke and myocardial 
infarction). 

Under low levels of genotoxic stress, p53 induces 
the expression of antioxidants, thereby supporting cell 
survival. Increasing levels of DNA damage stimulate 
the generation of increased reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)  levels  to  eliminate  cells  that  are  not  ﬁt  to 
survive or sustain too much damage.

Loss of p53 function by mutations in p53 or by a 
disruption of the p53 signaling pathway is frequently 
associated  with  human  cancers. This  observation 
underscores  the  signiﬁcant  importance  of  p53  in 
tumor suppression.

As tumor suppressor, the function of p53 is con-
trolled by sequestration and inhibition of its negative 
regulator, the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (Figure 
1-52). When MDM2 is inhibited, p53 remain stable 
and  active  to  operate  within  the  context  of  DNA 
damage or tumor suppression leading to apoptosis or 
cell cycle arrest. If MDM2 is active, p53 is degraded 

and the tumor suppression effect is lost.  

Mutations of the TP53 gene, which encodes the 
p53 protein, are observed in 50% of  human cancers. 
The loss of TP53 gene expression by an autosomal 
dominant mutation is responsible for a multicancer 
phenotype  known  as  Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  (see 
Box 1-V). 

The inactivation of p53 tumor suppression role has  
important therapeutic implications in cancer patients 
receiving chemotherapy with a potential genotoxic 
effect. A negative side effect of chemotherapy is the 
p53-driven apoptosis in sensitive tissues (for example, 
stem cells in bone marrow and intestinal epithelium) 
thus compromising effective tumor suppressor func-
tion.  Efforts are directed towards understanding the 
molecular mechanisms by which p53 can discriminate 
between acute DNA damage (genotoxic insult) and 
tumor suppression (oncogenic signaling). The goal is 
to block p53-dependent side effects of chemotherapy 
without the risk of compromising p53 tumor sup-
pression function. 

Pharmacologic  agents  binding  to  MDM2  could 
stabilize and increase the levels of p53 in cancer cells 
to exert a tumor-suppressor activity through its death-
inducing functions.  

Mitosis
Mitosis is preceded by the duplication of a pair of 
centrioles during the S phase of the cell cycle to form 
two centrosomes.  Centrioles are embedded in pro-
teins of the microtubule-organizing center (MOC).
Each centrosome moves toward opposite sites of the 
nucleus.  

The  primary  function  of  the  centrosome  is  the 
formation and maintenance of the mitotic spindle 
consisting of microtubules. About 1000 new micro-
tubules can be generated per minute on each centro-
some using a pool of tubulin dimers derived from 
disassembled cytoplasmic microtubules. 

Mitosis is divided into four substages: prophase, 
metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The highlights 
of mitosis are summarized in Figure 1-53. 

Basic Concepts of Medical Genetics
Medical genetics studies human biological variations 
related to health and disease. Figure 1-54 provides a 
Concept Mapping to help you integrate the relevant 
aspects of human development and genetics diseases 
described  below.  Box  1-W  illustrates  the  standard 
genetic symbols used for pedigree analysis. 

Genetic diseases can be caused by:
1.  Chromosomal  disorders:  chromosome  nu-
merical  abnormalities  and  chromosome  structural 
abnormalities.

2. Mendelian inheritance: Single gene defects 
3.  Non-mendelian  inheritance:  Multifactorial

disorders, somatic cell genetics disorders, and mi-
tochondrial disorders.

We  start  this  section  by  deﬁning  basic  aspects 
of  human  development,  with  particular  reference 
to teratogens, and by describing speciﬁc aspects of 
congenital disease, congenital malformations and 
congenital deformations.

Human development is divided into an embryonic 
period  and  a  fetal  period. The  embryonic  period 
starts at fertilization and ends 10 weeks later, when 
the age of the embryo is 8 weeks. At this time, all the 
precursor organs are formed. During the embryonic 
period,  the  embryo  is  susceptible  to  birth  defects 
caused  by  teratogens  (Greek  teras,  monster;  gen, 
producing), including:

1. Alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome). 
2.  Maternal  infections  (rubella,  toxoplasmosis, 

cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus).

3. Radiation (x-ray  exposure or radiation therapy).
4. Nutritional deﬁciencies (such as spina biﬁda, 

caused by a folate deﬁciency).

 After 8 weeks, the developing organism is called 
fetus and continues its development, completed by 
week 40.

A congenital disease is present at birth but may 
not be apparent after a few years (for example, an 
abnormality in heart development such as an atrial 
or ventricular septum defect). 

A congenital malformation occurs during embry-
onic development and is caused by a genetic defect. 
Congenital malformations include:

1. Agenesis: an organ fails to develop.
2. Hypoplasia (Greek hypo, under; plasis, y mold-
ing): an organ fails to achieve complete development.
3. Dysplasia (Preﬁx Greek dys, difﬁcult; plasis, a 

molding): the organization of a tissue is abnormal.

4.  Dysraphism  (dys;  rhaphe,  suture):  a  failure 
during embryonic fusion (for example, a myelome-
ningocele, known as spina biﬁda).

5. Atresia (Preﬁx Greek a, not; tresis, a hole): the 

lumen of an organ is not formed.

6. Ectopia (Greek ektopos, out of place): an organ or 
tissue failing to reach a normal location (for example, 
testicular maldescent or crytorchid).

 7. Lack of involution by apoptosis of a temporary 
embryological  structure  (for  example,  persistent 
thyroglossal duct).

A congenital deformation, such as hip dislocation 
or  clubfoot,  is  the  result  of  maternal  mechanical 
factors affecting fetal development (for example, a 
distorted uterus due to leiomyomas, benign tumors 
of the smooth muscle cell wall).

Chromosomal disorders 
Chromosomal  disorders  can  be  in  the  number  of 
individual chromosomes or structural abnormalities 
of individual chromosome.

Regarding chromosome numerical abnormalities:
1. Normal human somatic cells contain 46 chro-

mosomes, the diploid number.

2.  Normal  human  gamete  cells,  sperm  and  egg, 
contain 22 autosome chromosomes and 1 sex chro-
mosome  (X  or  Y  in  males  and  X  in  females),  the 
haploid number.

3. Polyploidy is the condition whereby the chromo-
some number exceeds the diploid number and this 
number is an exact multiple of the haploid number. 
Tetraploidy  is  four  times  the  haploid  number  (92 
chromosomes). Tetraploid hepatocytes  are observed 
during  liver  regeneration.  Megakaryocytes  are 
normally polyploid cells (they have 8-16 times the 
haploid number).

4. Aneuploidy (Greek an, without; eu, good; ploidy,  
condition)  arises  from  non-disjunction  of  paired 
sister  chromatids  (during  ﬁrst  meiotic  division)  or 
chromosomes  (during  second  meiotic  division). 
An  aneuploidy  individual  has  fewer  or  more  than 
the normal diploid number of chromosomes. This 
condition is usually deleterious, in particular when 
it affects the number of autosomes. 

A  lack  of  an  X  chromosome  in  female  cells  has 
severe  effects;  but  females  with  supernumerary  X 
chromosomes are usually normal or nearly normal 
because of X chromosome inactivation, a mechanism 
that balances the dosage of X-linked genes with that 
of XY males.

Chromosome structural abnormalities are the re-
sult of chromosomal breakage observed by exposure to 
ionizing radiations and in inherited conditions (such 
as in ataxia telangiectasia and Fanconi syndrome):

1. Translocation is the transfer of broken chromo-

somal material between chromosomes. 

There  are  three  forms  of  translocation:  recipro-
cal translocation, when there is reciprocal breaking 
and rejoining of any pair of chromosomes without 
overall gain or loss of genetic material; centric fusion 
(Robertsonian translocation), when two acrocentric 
chromosomes break close or at the centromere and 
rejoin into a single chromosome with two centromeres 
(dicentric chromosome) and a fragment with no cen-
tromere (acentric) that will be lost at the subsequent 
cell division; and insertional translocation, involving 
three breaks in one or two chromosomes, resulting in 
an interstitial deletion of a segment of one chromo-
some, that is inserted into the gap of the other. 

2. Deletion: a chromosomal segment breaks and 

is lost. 

3.  Inversion:  a  broken  chromosome  segment  is 
reinserted in the same chromosome but in an inverted 
orientation.  

4. Ring chromosome: the terminal ends of the arms 
of a chromosome are lost and the two proximal ends 
rejoin to form a closed circle.

5. Duplications, when an additional copy of a chro-
mosome is present. Duplications are more frequent 
than deletions and less harmful.

6. Isochromosome: a chromosome with a deletion 

of one arm with a duplication of the other.

Other chromosomal variants are:
1. Mosaic: an individual with two or more cell lines 
derived from a single zygote. For example, in female 
mammalian somatic tissues, one X chromosome is 
active and the other is transcriptionally inactive (an 
indication  of  dosage  compensation,  as  you  know). 
These tissues are regarded mosaic (whether the ma-
ternal or paternal X chromosome is active in cells of 
the somatic tissues).

2. Chimera: an individual with two or more cell 

lines derived from two separate zygotes.  

Mendelian inheritance: Single gene disorders
In human, there are 44 autosomes consisting of 22 
homologous pairs, with genes present in pairs (one of 
paternal origin and the other from maternal origin) 
and located in a speciﬁc site, or locus, within each 
chromosome. Alternative forms of a gene are called 
alleles (Greek allelon, reciprocally).  

If both pairs of genes are identical, the individual 
is  homozygous;  if  different,  the  individual  is  het-
erozygous. 

Any gene determines a characteristic, or trait. A 

Box 1-W | Pedigree analysis: Highlights to remember

•  The pedigree is a common tool used in medical genetics. It is constructed like 
a tree using standard genetic symbols to show inheritance patterns for speciﬁc 
phenotypic characteristics. A human pedigree starts with a family member, called 
the propositus, that attracts the attention of the geneticist as a means to trace 
back the progression of the phenotype through the family.

trait expressed in the heterozygote is dominant, and, 
if only expressed in the homozygote, it is recessive.
  Genetic diseases can be caused by defects in a single 
gene or a group of genes. The defects are expressed 
as dominant or recessive (mendelian inheritance).
 or require a coexisting environmental factor before 
a  disease  is  produced  (polygenic  or  multifactorial 
inheritance),  with  partial  contribution  of  genetic 
factors. 

Single gene defect disorders can be:
1. Autosomal chromosome-linked or sex chromo-
some-linked (mainly X chromosome-linked, affecting 
males devoid of dosage compensation as in females). 
As  we  have  seen,  one  of  the  X  chromosomes  in 
XX female cells undergoes inactivation. A structural 
representation  of  X  chromosome  inactivation  is  a 
condense chromatin structure at the nuclear periphery 
of female cells, known as Barr body. X chromosome 
inactivation silences most of the genes encoded on this 
chromosome, a condition called functional unisomy. 
Unisomy is the condition of an individual or cell 
carrying only one member of a pair of homologous 
chromosomes.  For  example,  male  cells  have  only 
one  X  chromosome,  a  situation  known  as genetic 
unisomy.

2. Homozygous, when the defective gene is present 

on both members of a chromosomal pair.

3. Heterozygous, when the defective gene is present 

on only one member of a chromosomal pair.

The  mendelian  inheritance  patterns  of  a  single 

gene defect are the following:

1.  Autosomal  dominant  inheritance:  expressed 
in heterozygotes; on the average half of offspring 
is affected. 

For  example,  familial  hypercholesterolemia  is 
caused by a single mutant gene on the short arm of 
chromosome 19, encoding a receptor for low density 
lipoprotein (LDL). Defect in the receptor results in 
defective  clearance  of  circulating  LDL,  including 
cholesterol.  Males  and  females  are  affected,  each 
is  a  heterozygote    and  can  transmit  the  condition 
if  each  has  married  an  affected  person  (a  normal 
homozygote). The  expected  proportion  of  affected 
individuals is 50%.

2. Autosomal recessive inheritance: expressed in 

homozygotes; low risk to offspring. 

For  example,  sickle  cell  disease  is  produced  by 
sickled-shaped red blood cells that may occlude blood 
vessels, causing recurrent infarctions of the lung and 
spleen (see Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis). 

The disease results from defective hemoglobin S 
(HbS) caused by a substitution of valine for glutamic 
acid. The predominant hemoglobin in normal indi-
viduals is HbA. A parent with sickle cell anemia that 
marries to a homozygous normal person (HbA/HbA) 
will produce unaffected heterozygous (HbA/HbS). If

a HbS/HbS individual marries a heterozygote, there is 
one in two chance on the average that each child may 
be affected. If both parents have sickle cell disease, 
all children will have sickle cell disease.

3.  Sex-linked  recessive  inheritance.  Male-to-
female X chromosome trait transmission will result 
in all daughter carriers (female-to-female transmis-
sion, 50% of the daughters are carriers). There is no 
male-to-male transmission of a gene defect. 

An  example  is  muscular  dystrophy  (Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy), a condition that causes progres-
sive muscular weakness with signiﬁcant elevation of 
creatine kinase and other muscle enzymes in blood. 
Heterozygous females are carriers  (clinically unaf-
fected) but transmit the condition. When a carrier 

female that marries a normal male, one-half of the 
daughters will be carriers and one-half of the sons 
will be affected.

4. Sex-linked dominant inheritance. X chromo-
some  disorders  are  observed  in  the  heterozygous 
female and in the heterozygous male (with a mutant 
allele on his single X chromosome). An affected male 
transmits the trait to all his daughters but none of 
his  sons.  Direct  male-to  male  transmission  cannot 
take place. 

Vitamin D-resistant rickets (even the dietary in-
take of vitamin D is normal) and the X-linked form 
of  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary motor 
and sensory neuropathy) are X chromosome-linked 
dominant conditions.

Cardiac malformations increase the death 
rate during infancy.

Similarly,  in  Y  chromosome-linked  dominant 
inheritance, only males are affected when the male 
transmits a Y-linked trait. 

Non-mendelian Inheritance
Polygenic diseases arise from the participation  of dis-
persed genes, each contributing to the characteristics 
of the disease lacking a distinct phenotype.  

Multifactorial disorders arise on a conditioning 
genetic  background  (predisposition  to  a  disease) 
that will only occur when triggering environmental 
factors are present. 

Multifactorial traits may be discontinuous (dis-
tinct phenotypes) or continuous (a lack of distinct 
phenotypes). Cleft lip and palate, congenital heart 
disease, neural tube defect and pyloric stenosis are 

congenital malformation inherited as a discontinu-
ous  multifactorial  traits.  Examples  of  continuous 
multifactorial  traits  are  height,  weight,  skin  color, 
and blood pressure..

In  contrast  to  mendelian  inheritance  disorders, 
pedigree analysis is not applicable and twin concor-
dance and family correlations studies are required. 

Twins may be genetically identical (monozygotic) 
or non-identical (dizygotic). Monozygotic twins arise 
from a single zygote which splits into two embryos. 
Dizygotic twins result from two eggs each fertilized 
by a sperm, have two amniotic sacs and two placentas, 
each  with  separate  circulation.  Most  monozygotic 
twins  have  a  single  placenta  with  common  blood 
circulation. 

Twins are concordant if they show a discontinu-

54

Medical genetics

ous trait  (such as height) and discordant if only one 
shows  the  trait.  Monozygotic  twins  have  identical 
genotypes; dizygotic twins are like siblings (brothers 
and sisters). If there is a chromosomal disorder or a 
speciﬁc single gene trait, the monozygotic concor-
dance rate will be 100%. For discontinuous multi-
factorial traits of genetic and environmental nature, 
the monozygotic concordance rate will be less than 
100% but higher than in the dizygotic twins. This 
range tells us about the increasing importance of the 
genetic contribution and heritability to a chromo-
somal disorder or a speciﬁc single gene trait when 
monozygotic concordance is higher. 

Relatives  share  a  proportion  of  their  genes  and 
family correlations studies can provide support for 
multifactorial inheritance of a trait.

Most cancers are regarded as somatic cell genetic 
disorders. Some familial cancers have germline muta-
tions; others display somatic cell mutations leading 
to malignancy. A mutation in a fertilized egg that 
occurs  after  the  ﬁrst  cell  division,  may  affect  the 
gonadal cells (gonadal mosaic) or the somatic cells 
(somatic mosaic). 

Mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in 
DNA mitochondrial are transmitted to all children 
of an affected mother but not to the offspring of an 
affected  father. We  discuss  further  the  patterns  of 
maternal inheritance of mitochondrial disorders in 
Chapter 2, Epithelial Glands.

Karyotyping (chromosome analysis)
Cytogenetics is the analysis of the structure of normal 
and abnormal chromosomes (Greek chromos, colored; 
soma, body). 

A  karyotype  (or  chromosome  analysis)  is  a  de-
scription of the number and structure of the chro-
mosomes. A standard karyotype is based on the use 
of metaphase cells from any population of dividing 

cells (Figure 1-55). Lymphocytes in peripheral blood 
are the most frequently used cells, but bone marrow 
cells, cultured ﬁbroblasts or cells from amniotic ﬂuid 
or chorionic villi can also be used.

 Cells are cultured in the presence of a mitogen 
(for example, phytohemagglutinin) for 3-4 days and 
treated  with  colcemid  to  disrupt  mitotic  spindles 
to  enrich  the  sample  in  metaphase  cells.  Cells  are 
collected and treated with an hypotonic solution to 
swell the cells and disperse chromosomes on a micro-
scope before ﬁxation and staining.  Giemsa staining 
is  generally  used  to  produce  G-banding,  alternate 
light and dark band patterns characteristic for each 
chromosome pair. 

There are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of 
sex chromosomes (XX or XY) in the human. Chro-
mosomes  can  be  classiﬁed  according  to  the  length 
and position of the centromere. 

In the notation of human cytogenetics, the total 
number  of  chromosomes  (46)  is  followed  by  the 
total number of sex chromosomes (see Figure 1-55). 
A normal male is identiﬁed as 46,XY (46 chromo-
somes, including the XY chromosomal pair) and a 
female  as  46,XX  (46  chromosomes,  including  the 
XX chromosomal pair). 

Extra  autosomes  are  indicated  by  placing  the 
number  of  the  extra  chromosomes  after  the  sex 
chromosomes  with  a  plus  (+)  sign.  47,XY+21  is 
the  karyotype  of  a  male  with  trisomy  21  (Down 
syndrome, see Figure 1-55).  

A male with an extra X chromosome is symbolized 
as 47,XXY. A plus or minus sign is placed following 
a  chromosome  symbol  to  indicate  the  increase  or 
decrease in arm length. The letter p symbolizes the 
short arm and q the long arm. 47,XY,+17p+ identi-
ﬁes  a  male  with  47  chromosomes,  including  an 
additional chromosome 17, with an increase in the 
length of its short arm.

Essential concepts

Epithelium 

• Epithelium is one of the four basic tissues. 
The three additional basic tissues are connec-
tive tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. 
  Epithelia can be classiﬁed into three major 
groups based on:
  (1) The number of cell layers (one layer: 
simple epithelium; more than one layer: strati-
ﬁed epithelium).
  (2) The shape of the cells (squamous 
epithelium, cuboidal epithelium, and columnar 
epithelium).
  (3) The shape of the cells at the outermost 
layer (stratiﬁed squamous epithelium, stratiﬁed 
cuboidal epithelium, and stratiﬁed columnar 
epithelium). 
  The stratiﬁed squamous epithelium can be 
subdivided into moderately keratinized (usually 
called nonkeratinized) and highly keratinized 

types. The name endothelium identiﬁes the 
simple squamous epithelium lining blood and 
lymphatic vessels. The name mesothelium 
is used to describe the simple squamous or 
cuboidal lining of serosa (peritoneum, pleura, 
and pericardium). Tumors originating in the 
mesothelium are called mesotheliomas.

• An important cytoskeletal component of 
epithelial cells are keratin proteins (cytokera-
tins). The pathologist looks for the presence 
of keratins to determine the epithelial origin 
of a tumor (called carcinoma, in contrast 
to connective tissue–derived tumors called 
sarcomas).

• An intermediate type is the pseudostratiﬁed 
epithelium, in which all the cells are in contact 

with the basal lamina, but not all of them 
reach the lumen. The transitional epithelium, 
or urothelium, lining the urinary passages, can 
be regarded as a pseudostratiﬁed epithelium, 
although it has the appearance of a stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. The outermost cells 
of the urothelium of the urinary bladder have 
the property of changing their geometry and 
surface conﬁguration in response to tensional 
forces exerted by urine. 

• A reﬁnement in the classiﬁcation of selected 
epithelia relies on apical differentiations, such 
as cilia, microvilli, and stereocilia. A pseudo- 
stratiﬁed epithelium with cilia is seen along 
the respiratory tract and the oviduct. Simple 
cuboidal epithelium of speciﬁc segments 
of the nephron and the simple columnar 

Karyotyping

55

epithelium of the small intestine contain mi-
crovilli forming a brush border along the apical 
domain. Stereocilia are seen in the epithelial 
lining of the epididymis and hair cells of the 
inner ear. 
  Epithelial cells organize layers of cells that are 
closely linked by specialized plasma mem-
brane–associated structures, such as tight 
junctions, anchoring junctions (belt and spot 
desmosomes and hemidesmosomes), and 
gap junctions.

• Epithelial cells are highly polarized. They have 
an apical domain and a basolateral domain. 
The boundaries of the domains are deﬁned 
by the distribution of junctions and their com-
ponents, the polarized distribution of the actin 
cytoskeleton, and the presence of a basement 
membrane at the basal surface. 

• The apical domain of some epithelial cells 
displays differentiations projecting into the lu-
men. The apical differentiations can be motile 
(multiple cilia) and nonmotile (primary cilium, 
microvilli and stereocilia/stereovilli). 
  There are multiple motile cilia, that coordi-
nate ﬂuid or cargo ﬂow on the surface of an 
epithelium and a single or primary non-motile 
cilium, a mechanosensor that houses compo-
nents of the hedgehog signaling system. 
  Cilia contain an axoneme, formed by a 
concentric array of nine microtubule doublets 
surrounding a central pair. Cilia originate from 
a basal body precursor—a centrosome deriva-
tive—inserted in the apical plasma membrane.
  In contrast to the axoneme, the basal body 
and the centriole are formed by nine microtu-
bule triplets in a helicoid arrangement. There 
are no central microtubules in basal bodies 
and centrioles. The nonmotile microvilli and 
stereocilia contain an actin microﬁlament core.  
Microvilli have a uniform length. Stereocilia 
are longer, their length is variable, and, in the 
epididymal epithelium, they have a tendency 
to branch.

• The position and stability of the epithelial 

cell layer are maintained by cell adhesion 
molecules and cell junctions.

• Cell adhesion molecules can be classiﬁed as:
  (1) Ca2+-dependent.
  (2) Ca2+-independent. 
  Cadherins and selectins are Ca2+-dependent. 
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the 
immunoglobulin-like family and integrins are 
Ca2+-independent. In contrast to cadherins, 
selectins, and CAMs, integrins consist of two 
subunits, (cid:95)(cid:3)and (cid:96), forming a heterodimer.
   Cadherins constitute homophilic cis-homodi-
mers (like-to-like), which interact through the 
extracellular domain with similar or different 
dimers present in the adjacent epithelial cell 
(forming trans-homodimers or trans-heterodi-
mers [like to unlike]). The intracellular domain 
of cadherins interacts with the catenin complex 
consisting of catenins (cid:95) and (cid:96) and p120. The 
catenin complex interacts with ﬁlamentous 
actin through adapter proteins ((cid:95)-actinin, 
formin-1, and vinculin).
   Selectins bind carbohydrate ligands through 
their carbohydrate recognition domain. 
Selectins play an important role in homing, 
the transendothelial migration of neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, and macrophages during inﬂam-
mation and the deposit of fatty streaks in the 
subendothelial space of blood vessels during 
early atherosclerotic lesions.  
   The extracellular immunoglobulin-like 
domain of CAMs binds to identical (homotypic 
binding) or different molecules (heterotypic 
binding) on another adjacent cell. The CAM 
CD4 is the receptor of HIV-1 in T cells (helper 
cells).
   Integrins are heterodimers formed by two 
associated subunits, (cid:95) and (cid:96). The extracellular 
domain of the integrin subunit (cid:96) binds to lam-
inin and ﬁbronectin, two components of the
basal lamina. Proteoglycans and collagens bind 
to laminin and ﬁbronectin to form the reticular 
lamina. The intracellular domain of integrin 
subunit (cid:96) binds to ﬁlamentous actin through 
the adapter proteins, including (cid:95)-actinin, 
vinculin, kindlin, and talin. Integrins establish a 

link between the extracellular matrix and the 
internal cytoskeleton. 
 
• The basement membrane is a PAS-positive 
(periodic acid-Schiff staining) structure present 
at the basal domain of epithelial cells. It con-
sists of a basal lamina and a reticular lamina, 
which can be deﬁned by electron micros-
copy. The pathologist looks for the integrity 
of the basal lamina to determine if growing 
malignant epithelial cells are restricted to the 
epithelial layer (carcinoma in situ) or have in-
vaded the underlying connective tissue where 
blood and lymphatic vessels are present.

  • Related to the function of integrins are the 
ADAM proteins. The disintegrin domain of 
selected ADAMs can block integrin-binding 
afﬁnities. The metalloprotease domain of 
ADAMs can participate in the shedding of the 
extracellular domain of plasma membrane–
anchored growth factors, cytokines, and 
receptors.  ADAMs have roles in angiogenesis, 
apoptosis, neurogenesis, and cancer.

• Cell junctions not only maintain the me-
chanical integrity of the epithelium but also 
can function as signaling structures reporting 
cell position and are able to modulate cell 
growth or programmed cell death (apoptosis). 
Intercellular junctions can be:
  (1) Symmetrical, such as tight junctions, 
belt desmosomes (zonula adherens), spot 
desmosomes (macula adherens) and gap 
junctions.
  (2) Asymmetrical, such as hemidesmo-
somes.
 
• Tight junctions consist of two transmem-
brane proteins—the tetraspanins occludin 
and claudin—and two immunoglobulin-like 
proteins—junctional adhesion molecules 
(JAMs) and nectins. Nectins are associated to 
the protein afadin forming the afadin-nectin 
complex. JAMs and nectins form dimers 
(called cis-dimers) and dimers inserted in 
the opposing plasma membrane interact with

  The adapter proteins zonula occludens ZO-1, 
ZO-2, and ZO-3 link occludin, claudins, JAMs, 
and the afadin-nectin complex to actin micro-
ﬁlaments. Claudins constitute the backbone of 
tight junction strands visualized on freeze-
fracture electron micrographs. 
  Tight junctions constitute a circumferential 
fence separating the apical domain from the 
basolateral domain. Materials can cross epi-
thelial and endothelial cellular sheets by two 
distinct pathways: the transcellular pathway 
and the paracellular pathway. Tight junctions 
regulate the paracellular transport of ions and 
molecules in a charge-dependent and size-
dependent fashion.
   Similar to tight junctions, zonula adherens 
(belt desmosome) also have a circumferen-
tial distribution and interact with ﬁlamentous 
actin. A distinctive feature is the presence of a 
plaque containing desmoplakin, plakoglobins 
and plakophilins. Cadherins (desmocollins and 
desmogleins) and the afadin-nectin complex 
link the plasma membranes of adjacent 
epithelial cells. The intracellular region of cad-
herins interacts with actin through the catenin 
complex.
   Macula adherens (spot desmosome) pro-
vides strength and rigidity to the epithelial cell 
layer, particularly in the stratiﬁed squamous ep-
ithelium, and links adjacent cardiocytes (fascia 
adherens and desmosome) as a component 
of the intercalated disk.  In contrast to the belt 
desmosome, spot desmosomes are spotlike. 
The plaque—which contains desmoplakin, 
plakoglobins, and plakophilins—is the insertion 
site of intermediate ﬁlament keratins (called 
tonoﬁlaments) or desmin (intercalated disk). 
The intermediate ﬁlament-binding protein 
in the plaque is desmoplakin. The catenin 
complex is not present. Desmocollins and 
desmogleins are the predominant cadherins.

Hemidesmosomes are asymmetrical 

anchoring junctions found at the basal region 
of epithelial cells. Hemidesmosomes consist 
of two components: an inner plate, associated 
to intermediate ﬁlaments, and an outer plaque 
anchoring the hemidesmosome to the basal 
lamina by anchoring ﬁlaments (laminin 5).

Gap junctions are symmetrical com-

municating junctions (instead of anchoring 
junctions). Gap junctions consist of clusters 
of intercellular channels connecting the 
cytoplasm of adjacent cells. There are more 
than 20 connexin monomers, each identiﬁed 
by the assigned molecular mass. Six connexin 
monomers form a connexon inserted into the 
plasma membrane. Connexons pair with their 
counterparts in the plasma membrane of an 
adjacent cell and form an axial intercellular 
channel allowing the cell-to-cell diffusion of 
ions and small molecules. A mutation in con-
nexin32 (Cx32) gene in the myelin-producing 
Schwann cell is the cause of the X-chromo-
some–linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, 
a demyelinating disorder of the peripheral 
nervous system.

• The basement membrane consists of two 
components: 

  (1) A basal lamina, in direct contact with the 
epithelial basal cell surface.
  (2) A reticular lamina, formed by ﬁbronectin 
and collagen ﬁbers and continuous with the 
connective tissue. 
  The basal lamina consists of laminin, type 
IV collagen, entactin, and proteoglycans. The 
basal lamina is an important component of the 
glomerular ﬁltration barrier in the kidneys.  A 
basal lamina covers the surface of muscle cells 
and contributes to maintaining the integrity of 
the skeletal muscle ﬁber during contraction. A 
disruption of the basal lamina–cell muscle re-
lationship gives rise to muscular dystrophies. 
The basement membrane can be recognized 
by light microscopy by the PAS stain. 

• The cytoskeleton consists of:
  (1) Microﬁlaments (7 nm thick).
  (2) Microtubules (25 nm in diameter).
  (3) Intermediate ﬁlaments (10 nm in diam-
eter). 
  The basic unit of a microﬁlaments is the 
G-actin monomer.  The ATP-dependent po-
lymerization of monomers forms a 7-nm-thick 
F-actin ﬁlament.  Monomers added on the 
barbed end of the ﬁlament move, or treadmill, 
along the ﬁlament until they detach by depoly-
merization at the pointed end. 
   Motor proteins, such as myosin Va, transport 
vesicle cargos along F-actin. Defective myosin 
Va is the cause of Griscelli syndrome, a 
disorder in the transport of melanosomes from 
melanocytes to keratinocytes in the epidermis. 
Patients with Griscelli syndrome have silvery 
hair, partial albinism, occasional neurologic 
defects, and immunodeﬁciency. 
   F-actin associated with myosin II forms the 
contractile structures of skeletal and cardiac 
muscle cells. They represent the myoﬁlament 
components of myoﬁbrils. Myoﬁbrils, consist-
ing of a linear chain of sarcomeres, are the 
basic contractile unit found in the cytoplasm of 
striated muscle cells.
  Microtubules are composed of (cid:95) and (cid:96)(cid:3)
tubulin dimers. Tubulin dimers arranged 
longitudinally form protoﬁlaments. Thirteen 
protoﬁlaments associate side-by-side with each 
other to form a microtubule.  Microtubules 
undergo alternate phases of slow growth and 
rapid depolymerization, a process called dy-
namic instability. The polymerization of tubulin 
subunits is GTP-dependent. 
   The centrosome consists of a pair of cen-
trioles surrounded by a pericentriolar protein 
matrix. Each centriole consists of nine triplets 
of microtubules arranged in a helicoid manner. 
Centrioles duplicate during the cell cycle in 
preparation for the assembly of the mitotic 
spindle during cell division. A basal body 
precursor is produced inside the centrosome, 
multiplies, differentiates into basal a basal 
body and docks to the plasma membrane to 
develop a cilium.  
  The mitotic apparatus consists of two op-
posite mitotic centers bridged by the mitotic 
spindle. Each mitotic center is represented 
by the centrosome (a pair of centrioles 
embedded in a protein matrix, the microtu-
bular organizing center, MOC) and radiating 

microtubules. The mitotic spindle consists of 
kinetochore microtubules and polar microtu-
bules. Kinetochore microtubules attach to the 
kinetochore, a cluster of proteins associated 
with the centromere, the primary constriction 
of a chromosome. Centrosome and centro-
mere sound alike words but they represent 
two different structures.
   Microtubules are a target of cancer che-
motherapy with the purpose of blocking 
cell division of tumor cells by destabilizing or 
stabilizing dynamic instability. Derivatives of 
Vinca alkaloids and taxol have been widely 
used.
  The axoneme consists of nine microtubule 
doublets in a concentric array, surround-
ing a central pair of microtubules. Each 
doublet consists of a tubule A, formed by 
13 protoﬁlaments and closely attached to 
tubule B, formed by 10 to 11 protoﬁlaments. 
Axonemes are present in cilia and ﬂagella of 
the sperm tail. Dynein arms, an ATPase, are 
linked to tubule A. ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to 
use energy for the sliding of microtubules, the 
basis for ciliary and ﬂagellar movement.
  Microtubules provide tracks for motor pro-
tein transporting vesicle and nonvesicle cargos 
within the cell. Molecular motors, such as 
kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, mediate the 
transport of cargos. 
  There are three speciﬁc microtubule-based 
transport systems: 
  (1) Axonemal transport, which includes 
intraciliary and intraﬂagellar transport.
  (2) Axonal transport.
  (3) Intramanchette transport. Manchette is 
a transient microtubular structure involved in 
sperm development.
  Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a disorder of 
basal bodies and cilia resulting from defective 
intraciliary transport, is characterized by retinal 
dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal dysplasia, 
reproductive tract abnormalities, and learning 
disabilities. 
   Kartagener’s syndrome, characterized by 
defective or absent dynein arms, is associated 
with bronchiectasis and infertility (reduced 
sperm motility and egg transport in the 
oviduct).
   Intermediate ﬁlaments are formed by 
monomers displaying a central coiled-coil 
ﬂanked by globular regions. A pair of mono-
mers form a parallel dimer. A tetramer is 
assembled by two antiparallel half staggered 
dimers. Eight tetramers associate side-by-side 
to form a unit length ﬁlament (ULF). ULFs join 
end-to-end and continue extending longitu-
dinally by adding ULFs to form 10 nm-thick 
intermediate ﬁlaments. 
  In contrast to F-actin and microtubules, the 
assembly of intermediate ﬁlaments is regu-
lated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. 
  There are several types of intermediate ﬁla-
ments, including:
  (1) Type I and Type II keratins (markers of 
epithelial cells).
  (2) Type III:  Vimentin (present in mesen-
chymal-derived cells), desmin (abundant in 
muscle cells), and glial fribrillary acidic protein 
(a marker of glial cells).

  (3) Type IV: Neuroﬁlaments (found in 
neurons).
  (4) Type V: Lamins (forming the nuclear 
lamina associated to the inner layer of the 
nuclear envelope). 
   Disorders of keratins cause blistering 
diseases of the skin.  Defective gene expres-
sion of lamins causes a group of diseases 
called laminopathies affecting muscle tissue 
(e.g., Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy), 
nervous tissue (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease type 2B1), and adipose tissue (e.g., 
Dunnigan-type familial lipodystrophy).

• The cell nucleus consists of the nuclear 
envelope, chromatin, and the nucleolus. 
The nuclear envelope has nuclear pores, a 
tripartite structure consisting of inner and outer 
octagonal rings and a central cylindrical body. 
Nuclear pores contain several proteins called 
nucleoporins. Ran-GTPase regulates nucleo-
cytoplasmic transport across nuclear pores 
by enabling the passage of proteins with a 
nuclear import sequence bound to a protein 
complex of importins (cid:95) and (cid:96) and Ran-GDP. 
In the nucleus, Ran-GDP is converted to 
Ran-GTP by RCCI, a GDP-GTP exchanger and 
the importin-imported protein complex is 
dissociated. Ran-GTP associates with exportins, 
and proteins with a nuclear export sequence 
are transported to the cytoplasm. Ran-GTP 
interacts with Ran-GBP1, and is converted to 
Ran-GDP by hydrolysis stimulated by Ran-GAP. 
The cargo is discharged, and Ran-GDP is ready 
to initiate another transport cycle.
  Two forms of chromatin exist: heterochro-
matin (transcriptionally inactive) and euchro-
matin (transcriptionally active). One of the 
two X chromosomes in every female somatic 
cell remains condensed, a process known 
as dosage compensation. The condensed X 
chromosome can be visualized as a mass of 
heterochromatin adjacent to the nuclear enve-
lope (called Barr body) and in the form of a 
drumstick in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
  The nucleolus consists of a ﬁbrillar center 
(chromatin containing repeat rRNA genes, 
RNA polymerase I, and SRP); a dense ﬁbrillar 
component (containing the proteins ﬁbrillarin 
and nucleolin); and a granular component 
(the assembly sites of ribosomal subunits).

• Staining techniques and autoradiography 
can determine the localization of nucleic acids 
in cells. The Feulgen reaction detects DNA. 
Basic dyes can localize DNA and RNA. RNAse 
and DNAse cell pretreatment can deﬁne the 
identity of the basophilic staining.  Autoradi-
ography is based on the administration of a 
radiolabeled precursor to living cells. Radioac-
tive sites can be traced using a photographic 
emulsion, which after developing and ﬁxation, 
produces silver grain in sites where the radiola-
beled precursor is localized. This procedure 
enables the study of the cell cycle and the 
detection of sites involved in protein synthesis, 
glycosylation, and transport. Fluorescence-
activated cell sorting enables the identiﬁcation 
and separation of cell types using cell surface 

markers, and the study of the cell cycle based 
on the content of DNA.

• Cell cycle is deﬁned as the interval between 
two successive cell divisions resulting in the 
production of two daughter cells. Traditionally, 
the cell cycle consists of two major phases: 
  (1) Interphase.
  (2) Mitosis. 
  Interphase includes the S phase (DNA 
synthesis), preceded by the G1 phase and 
followed by the G2 phase. The phases of 
mitosis are: 
  (1)  Prophase: the centrosomes organize the 
mitotic spindle; lamins phosphorylate and the 
nuclear envelope breaks down; each chromo-
some consists of sister chromatids held to-
gether at the centromere; the protein cohesin 
holds together the noncentromeric regions; 
condensin compacts the chromatin.  
  (2) Metaphase: kinetochore microtubules 
attach to the kinetochore present in each chro-
mosome; chromosomes align at the equatorial 
plate; the anaphase-promoting complex disas-
sembles if the attachment of the kinetochore 
microtubules is correct. 
  (3)  Anaphase: topoisomerase frees en-
tangled chromatin ﬁbers; chromatids separate 
from each other and move closer to their 
respective poles—anaphase A—and cell poles 
separated by the action of polar microtu-
bules—anaphase B.
  (4) Telophase: lamins dephosphorylate 
and the nuclear envelope reassembles; 
chromosomes decondense; a contractile ring 
(actin-myosin) develops during cytokinesis; 
microtubules of the spindle disappear.   
  In a more contemporary view, the cell cycle 
consists of three distinct cycles: 
  (1) Cytoplasmic cycle (sequential activation 
of cyclin-dependent protein kinases.
  (2) Nuclear cycle (DNA replication and chro-
mosome condensation).
  (3) Centrosome cycle (duplication of the two 
centrioles—mother and daughter centrioles—
in preparation for assembly of the mitotic 
apparatus).

• Cyclin-dependent protein kinases control the 
progression and completion of the cell cycle.
  Tumor-suppressor proteins control cell cycle 
progression. Dephosphorylated Rb protein, a 
tumor-suppressor, binds to transcription factors 
and represses gene activity. Transcription fac-
tors dissociate from phosphorylated Rb protein 
and stimulate cell cycle progression. Retino-
blastoma, a malignant tumor of the eye, is 
observed when the Rb gene is mutated. 
  Another tumor-suppressor protein is p53, a 
transcription factor with a cell cycle regulatory 
function. Mutations of the p53 gene are seen 
in patients with leukemias, lymphomas, and 
brain tumors. p53 has a protective cell func-
tion: it can induce apoptosis or arrest the cell 
cycle when the cell undergoes harmful stress 
(called genotoxic stress). Mutations of the 
p53 gene prevent this protective function.
  Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a muta-
tion of the p53 gene. Young patients have a 

predisposition to cancer (e.g., brain tumors, 
breast tumors, acute leukemia, and soft tissue 
and bone sarcomas).

• Breakdown of the nuclear envelope oc-
curs at the end of prophase. It involves 
the fragmentation of the nuclear envelope, 
dissociation of nuclear pore complexes, and 
phosphorylation of lamins (depolymerization). 
Reassembly of the nuclear envelope involves 
the dephosphorylation of lamins by a protein 
phosphatase.  
  Telomeres at the end regions of chromo-
somes are formed by a stretch of repeated 
nucleotide sequences. When DNA poly-
merase fails to copy the chromosomal ends, 
telomeres decrease in length with every cell 
division until the integrity of the chromosome 
cannot be maintained. Male and female 
germinal cells can protect the telomeres by 
the enzyme telomerase, which is not present 
in somatic cells. Most tumor cells express 
telomerase.

• Genetic diseases can be caused by:
  (1) Chromosomal disorders (numerical 
[polyploidy, tetraploidy and aneuploidy] and 
structural [translocation, deletion, inversion, 
ring chromosome, duplication and isochromo-
some] abnormalities).
  (2) Mendelian inheritance (autosomal or sex 
chromosome-linked dominant and recessive 
single gene defects that can be homozygous 
or heterozygous).
  (3) Non-mendelian inheritance (including 
multifactorial disorders [discontinuous or con-
tinuous], somatic cell genetic disorders [can-
cer] and mitochondrial disorders [determined 
by mutations in mitochondrial DNA transmit-
ted to all children of an affected mother but 
not to the offspring of an affected father]).
  Human development is divided into an 
embryonic period (from fertilization to the 
8-week embryo) and a fetal period (after 
week 8 to week 40). Birth defects caused by 
teratogens predominate during the embryonic 
period. Teratogens include alcohol (fetal alco-
hol syndrome), maternal infections, exposure 
to radiations, nutritional deﬁciencies (spina 
biﬁda caused by a folate deﬁciency).
  Congenital diseases are present at birth but 
not fully apparent after a few years. Con-
genital malformations (including agenesis, 
hypoplasia, dysplasia, dysraphism, atresia, 
ectopia and lack of involution by apoptosis) 
take place during embryonic development 
and are caused by genetic defects.  Congeni-
tal deformations occur in utero by mechanical 
factors. 
  Karyotyping is the structural and numeri-
cal analysis of metaphase chromosomes. A 
normal male has a chromosomal comple-
ment 46,XY (46 chromosomes, including the 
XY chromosomal pair). A normal female has 
46,XX (46 chromosomes, including the XX 
chromosomal pair). Depending on the posi-
tion of the centromere or primary constriction, 
chromosomes are classiﬁed as metacentric, 
submetacentric, and acrocentric.

1. EPITHELIUM      

Essential concepts

2. Epithelial Glands

There are two types of epithelial glands: exocrine glands and endocrine glands. Exocrine glands secrete their 
product onto body surfaces through a duct; endocrine glands are ductless and secrete their products, hormones, 
into the interstitial spaces before entering the blood circulation. Exocrine glands are classiﬁed as simple and 
branched or compound glands. Secretory cells of exocrine glands discharge their products in three different 
mechanisms: a merocrine mechanism, utilizing membrane-bound secretory vesicles; an apocrine mechanism, 
by releasing a secretory product surrounded by a rim of cytosol; and a holocrine mechanism,  involving the 
release of a disintegrating cell that becomes the secretory product. This chapter integrates the structure and 
function of exocrine glands with basic concepts of cell and molecular biology.  

Development of epithelial glands
Most  glands  develop  as  epithelial  outgrowths  into 
the underlying connective tissue (Figure 2-1). Exo-
crine glands remain connected to the surface of the 
epithelium by an excretory duct that transports the 
secretory product to the outside.  Endocrine glands 
lack an excretory duct, and their product is released 
into the blood circulation.

Endocrine  glands  are  surrounded  by  fenestrated 
capillaries  and  commonly  store  the  secretions  they 
synthesize and release  after stimulation by chemical 
or electrical signals. Exocrine and endocrine glands 
can be found together (for example, in the pancreas), 
as  separate  structures  in  endocrine  organs  (thyroid 
and parathyroid glands), or as single cells (enteroen-
docrine cells). Endocrine glands will be studied later 
in Chapter 18, Neuroendocrine System, and Chapter 
19, Endocrine System.

Classiﬁcation of epithelial glands
Glands are classiﬁed according to the type of excretory 
duct  into  simple  and  branched  (also  called  com-
pound) glands. The gland can be simple (Figure 2-2) 
when the excretory duct is unbranched. The gland 
can be branched when the excretory duct subdivides
(Figure 2-3).
 
Secretory portion: Unicellular and multicellular 
An exocrine gland has two components: a secretory 
portion and an excretory duct. The secretory portion
of a gland may be composed of  one cell type (unicel-
lular, for example, goblet cells in the respiratory epi-
thelium and intestine) or many cells (multicellular).

General organization of a branched (compound) gland

1

A branched gland is surrounded by a connective tissue capsule 
that sends partitions or septa        inside the gland to organize 
large units called lobes (interlobar septa; not shown). 
  Lobes are subdivided by connective tissue interlobular septa into 
small subunits called lobules      .      
  A branched gland consists of a varying number of secretory units 
classified according to their morphology as tubular, acinar      , or 

3

tubuloacinar. The secretion drains into excretory ducts located 
between lobules (interlobular ducts       ).  Within a lobule, 
intercalated ducts      , smaller than the diameter of an acinus, 
connect acini with striated ducts (      ). Striated ducts, present only 
in salivary glands but not in pancreas, drain into interlobular ducts.  
Interlobular ducts converge to form lobar ducts (not shown). See 
Figure 2-4, and Chapter 17, Digestive Glands, for additional 
information.

According to the shape of the secretory portion 
(see  Figures  2-2  and  2-3),  glands  can  be  tubular, 
coiled, or alveolar (Latin alveolus, small hollow sac; 
plural alveoli), also called acinar (Latin acinus, grape; 
plural acini).  

Simple tubular glands are found in the small and 
large intestine. The sweat glands of the skin are typi-
cal coiled glands. The sebaceous gland of the skin is 
an example of an alveolar gland. The gastric mucosa 
and endometrium have branched secretory units.

All branched exocrine glands contain epithelial components 
(secretory acini and ducts) called parenchyma, and supporting 
connective tissue, including blood and lymphatic vessels and 
nerves, called the stroma.
   The gland is enclosed by a connective tissue capsule that 
branches inside the gland forming septa (singular septum) that 
subdivide the parenchyma. 
    In large branched glands, the parenchyma is anatomically 
subdivided into lobes. Adjacent lobes are separated by interlobar 
septa.  A lobe is formed by lobules, separated from each other by 

a thin interlobular septa.
   Septa support the major branches of the excretory duct, blood 
and lymphatic vessels, and nerves. Interlobular ducts extend 
along interlobular septa; lobar ducts extend along interlobar 
septa. Intercalated and striated ducts lie within lobules and are 
surrounded by little connective tissue.  
  Intercalated and striated ducts are lined by a simple 
cuboidal-to-simple columnar epithelium, whereas the epithelial 
lining of interlobular ducts is pseudostratified columnar. Lobar 
ducts are lined by a stratified columnar epithelium.

Shape of the secretory portion 
Glands can be classiﬁed as simple tubular or simple 
alveolar  (or  acinar)  according  to  the  shape  of  the 
secretory portion. In addition, tubular and alveolar 
secretory  portions  can  coexist  with  branching  ex-
cretory  ducts;  the  gland  is  called  a  branched  (or 
compound)  tubulo-alveolar  (or  acinar)  gland  (for 
example, the salivary glands).  The mammary gland 
is an example of a branched alveolar gland.

A branched gland (Figure 2-4) is surrounded by 
a  connective  tissue  capsule.  Septa  or  trabeculae 
extend  from  the  capsule  into  the  glandular  tissue. 
Large interlobar septa divide the gland into a num-
ber  of  lobes.  Branches  from  the  interlobar  septa, 
interlobular septa, subdivide the lobes into smaller 
compartments called lobules.

During development, a main excretory duct gives 
rise  to  branches  that  lie  between  lobes,  inside  the 
interlobar septa. Small branches derived from each 
of  these  ducts  generate  small  subdivisions. These 
branches  can  be  found  ﬁrst  between  lobules  (in 
interlobular septa) and within lobules (intercalated 
and striated ducts). Additional details are presented 
in Chapter 17, Digestive Glands.

Types of secretion
Based on the type of secretion, exocrine glands can 
be classiﬁed as mucous glands, when their products 
are rich in glycoproteins and water; serous glands, 
with  secretions  enriched  with  proteins  and  water; 
and mixed glands, which contain both mucous and 
serous cells (Figure 2-5).

Mixed secretory portion 
(submandibular or submaxillary gland)
The submandibular gland contains both serous and 
mucous secretory portions and they produce a 
seromucous secretion delivered into the same lumen. 
Mixed secretory units are made up of mucous cells and a 
small cap of serous cells on one side. The cap is called 
the serous demilune because of its crescent moon 
shape. Surrounding each secretory unit and the initial 
portion of the excretory duct are the myoepithelial cells. 
Myoepithelial cells are placed between the secretory 
cells and the basal lamina and their long and branched 
cytoplasmic processes form a loose basket. Their 
function is to contract and squeeze the secretion out of 
the secretory portion and along the duct system.

Mucous secretory portion (sublingual gland)
The sublingual gland contains mucous secretory 
portions that appear pale because of the high content 
of mucus-containing secretory vesicles. The nuclei 
generally lie flattened against the basal portion of the 
secretory cells. The secretory content can be 
demonstrated by the PAS reaction, which stains 
glycoproteins. Myoepithelial cells are also present 
around the mucous secretory portions.

Serous secretory portion (parotid gland)
The parotid gland contains serous secretory portions. 
The serous-secreting cells have a large spherical 
nucleus, a basal region in which the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum predominates, and an apical region with red- 
stained zymogen granules. Zymogen granules 
represent secretory vesicles containing enzyme 
precursors.

Mechanisms of secretion
Exocrine glands can also be classiﬁed on the basis of 
how the secretory product is released (Figure 2-6).
In merocrine secretion (Greek meros, part; krinein, 
to separate), the product is released by exocytosis. 
Secretory  granules  are  enclosed  by  a  membrane 

that fuses with the apical plasma membrane during 
discharge or exocytosis. An example is the secretion 
of zymogen granules by the pancreas.

In apocrine secretion (Greek apoknino, to separate), 
the release of the secretory product involves partial 
loss of the apical portion of the cell. An example is

Merocrine secretion

The secretory vesicle approaches the apical 
domain of an epithelial cell. The vesicular 
membrane fuses with the plasma membrane 
to release its contents into the extracellular 
space.
   The fused plasma membrane can be taken 
back into the cell by endocytosis and 
recycled for further use by secretory vesicles.

Apocrine secretion

Holocrine secretion

 Some of the apical cytoplasm is pinched off 
with the contained secretions.
   Mammary glands secrete milk lipids by 
apocrine secretion and the milk protein 
casein by merocrine secretion. 

The cell produces and accumulates a 
secretory product in the cytoplasm, such as 
sebum in sebaceous glands, and then 
disintegrates to release the secretory 
material.

the secretion of lipids by epithelial cells of the mam-
mary gland. Proteins secreted by epithelial cells of 
the mammary gland follow the merocrine pathway 
(exocytosis).

In holocrine secretion (Greek holos, all), the se-
cretory  product  constitutes  the  entire  cell  and  its 
product. An example is the sebaceous glands of the 
skin, which produce a secretion called sebum.

Plasma membrane and cytomembranes
A review of major concepts of cell membranes and 
organelles and their clinical relevance are presented 
in  this  chapter.  Epithelial  glands  are  a  convenient 
topic for this integration. We initiate the review by 
addressing the structural and biochemical characteris-
tics of the plasma membrane. Additional information 
related to plasma membrane–mediated cell signaling 
is presented in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling. 

The plasma membrane determines the structural 
and  functional  boundaries  of  a  cell.    Intracellular 
membranes, called cytomembranes, separate diverse 
cellular processes into compartments known as or-
ganelles. The nucleus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, 
and  lysosomes  are  membrane-bound  organelles; 
lipids and glycogen are not membrane-bound and 
are known as inclusions.

Plasma membrane
The plasma membrane consists of lipids and pro-
teins. The phospholipid bilayer is the fundamental 
structure of the membrane and forms a bilayer barrier 
between  two  aqueous  compartments:  the  extracel-
lular  and  intracellular  compartments.  Proteins  are 

embedded within the phospholipid bilayer and carry 
out speciﬁc functions of the plasma membrane such 
as  cell-cell  recognition  and  selective  transport  of 
molecules (see Box 2-A).

Phospholipid bilayer
Membrane lipids have three general functions:

1. Cell membranes consist of polar lipids with a 
hydrophobic portion that self-associates, and a hydro-
philic portion, that interacts with water–containing 
molecules. This amphipathic property enables cells 
and organelles to establish an internal setting sepa-
rated from the external environment.

2. Lipids enable some intramembranous proteins 

to aggregate and others to disperse.

Phospholipids, ceramide and cholesterol are syn-
thesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Sphingolipids 
synthesis takes place in the Golgi apparatus. 

3.  Lipids  can  participate  in  cell  signaling  (for 

example, phosphatidylinositol and diacylglycerol).

  The four major phospholipids of plasma mem-
branes are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyletha-
nolamine,  phosphatidylserine  and  sphingomyelin 
(Figure  2-7). They  represent  more  than  one  half  
the lipid of most membranes. A ﬁfth phospholipid, 
phosphatidylinositol, is localized to the inner leaﬂet 
of the plasma membrane.

In  addition  to  phospholipids,  the  plasma  mem-
brane of animal cells contains glycolipids and cho-
lesterol. Glycolipids, a minor membrane component, 
are found in the outer leaﬂet, with the carbohydrate 
moieties exposed on the cell surface.

Cholesterol,  a  major  membrane  constituent,  is

 Box 2-A | Lipid rafts

•  A lipid raft is a region of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and 
sphingolipids. Although the classic lipid raft lacks structural proteins, others 
are enriched in a particular structural protein that modiﬁes the composition and 
function of the lipid raft. 
•  Caveolin proteins are components of lipid rafts participating in the trafﬁc of 
vesicles or caveolae (see Figure 7-22 in Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue).   Caveolae 
are found in several cell types, particularly in ﬁbroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial 
cells, type I alveolar cells, epithelial cells, and smooth and striated muscle cells.
•  Other protein families, in addition to the caveolin protein family (caveolin-1, 
-2, and -3), can modify the structure and function of lipid rafts. These proteins in-
clude ﬂotillins, glycosphingolipid-linked proteins, and Src tyrosine kinases.
•  Lipid rafts can participate in cell signaling by concentrating or separating 
speciﬁc membrane-associated proteins in unique lipid domains. 

present in about the same amounts as are phospho-
lipids. Cholesterol, a rigid ring structure, is inserted 
into the phospholipid bilayer to modulate membrane 
ﬂuidity by restricting the movement of phospholipid 
fatty acid chains at high temperatures. Cholesterol is 
not present in bacteria.

Two  general  aspects  of  the  phospholipid  bilayer 

are important to remember:

1. The structure of phospholipids accounts for 
the function of membranes as barriers between two 
aqueous compartments. The hydrophobic fatty acid 
chains in the interior of the phospholipid bilayer are 
responsible for the membranes being impermeable 
to water-soluble molecules.  

2. The phospholipid bilayer is a viscous ﬂuid. The 
long hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids of most 
phospholipids are loosely packed and can move in 
the interior of the membrane. Therefore, phospho-
lipids  and  proteins  can  diffuse  laterally  within  the 
membrane to perform critical membrane functions.

Membrane proteins
Most plasma membranes consist of about 50% lipid 
and 50% protein. The carbohydrate component of 
glycolipids and glycoproteins represents 5% to 10% 
of  the  membrane  mass. The  surface  of  a  plasma 
membrane is coated by a glycocalyx (see Box 2-B).
According to the ﬂuid mosaic model of the mem-
brane  structure,  membranes  are  two-dimensional 
ﬂuids in which proteins are inserted into lipid bilayers. 
It is difﬁcult for membrane proteins and phospholip-
ids to switch back and forth between the inner and 
outer  leaﬂets  of  the  membrane.  However,  because 
they exist in a ﬂuid environment, both proteins and 
lipids are able to diffuse laterally through the plane of 
the membrane. However, not all proteins can diffuse 
freely; the mobility of membrane proteins is limited 
by their association with the cytoskeleton. 

Restrictions in the mobility of membrane proteins 
are responsible for the polarized nature of epithelial 
cells,  divided  into  distinct  apical  and  basolateral 
domains that differ in protein composition and func-
tion. Tight junctions between adjacent epithelial cells

Cholesterol is a major membrane component but it does 
not form the membrane by itself. Cholesterol has an effect 
on membrane fluidity by modulating the movement of the 
fatty acid chains of phospholipids in a temperature- 
dependent manner.

The outer leaflet consists mainly of phosphatidylcholine, 
sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylethanolamine. 
Glycolipids are found only in the outer leaflet, with their 
carbohydrate portion exposed to the extracellular space. 

The inner leaflet consists mainly of phosphatidylserine, 
phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. 
The head groups of phosphatidylserine and 
phosphatidylinositol are negatively charged, so the 
cytosolic face of the plasma membrane has a net negative 
charge.  Phosphatidylinositol plays a significant role in 
signaling (see Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).

Plasma membrane

 Box 2-B | Glycocalyx

• The extracellular domain of a plasma membrane is generally glycosylated by the 
carbohydrate portions of glycolipids and transmembrane glycoproteins. The surface 
of the cell is, therefore, covered by a carbohydrate coat, known as the glycocalyx.
• The glycocalyx protects the cell surface and facilitates cell-cell interactions. An 
appropriate example is the mechanism of homing, a process allowing leukocytes 
to leave blood vessels and mediate inﬂammatory responses. As you recall, the 
initial step in adhesion between endothelial cells and leukocytes is mediated by 
selectins, a family of transmembrane proteins which recognize speciﬁc sugars 
on the cell surface.

(discussed in Chapter 1, Epithelium) not only seal 
the space between cells but also serve as barriers to 
the diffusion of proteins and lipids between the apical 
and basolateral domains of the plasma membrane. 
Two major classes of membrane-associated proteins 

are recognized (Figure 2-8):  

1. Peripheral proteins.
2. Integral membrane proteins. 
Peripheral  membrane  proteins  are  not  inserted 
into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane but 
are,  instead,  indirectly  associated  with  membranes 
through  protein-protein  ionic  bond  interactions, 
which are disrupted by solutions of high salt con-
centration or extreme pH. 

Portions of integral membrane proteins are inserted 
into  the  lipid  bilayer. They  can  only  be  released 
by  solubilization  using  detergents.  Detergents  are 
chemical agents that contain both hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic groups. The hydrophobic groups of the 
detergent penetrate the membrane lipids and bind to 
the membrane-inserted hydrophobic portion of the 

protein. The hydrophilic groups combine with the 
protein, forming aqueous-soluble detergent-protein 
complexes.

Numerous integral proteins are transmembrane 
proteins, spanning the lipid bilayer, with segments 
exposed  on  both  sides  of  the  membrane. Trans-
membrane proteins can be visualized by the freeze-
fracture technique.

Freeze-fracture:  Differences  between  a  surface 
and a face
The  freeze-fracture  technique  is  valuable  for  the 
visualization of intramembranous proteins with the 
electron microscope. This technique provided the 
ﬁrst evidence for the presence of transmembrane pro-
teins in the plasma membrane and cytomembranes. 
Specimens  are  frozen  at  liquid  nitrogen  tem-
perature (–196oC) and “split” with  a knife (under 
high vacuum)  along the hydrophobic core of the 
membrane. As a result, two complementary halves, 
corresponding to each membrane bilayer, are pro-
duced. Each membrane half has a surface and a face. 
The face is artiﬁcially produced during membrane 
splitting. 

A replica of the specimen is generated by evapo-
rating a very thin layer of a heavy metal (generally 
platinum with a thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 nm) at a 45o 
angle  to  produce  a  contrasting  shadowing  effect. 
The platinum replica is then detached from the real 
specimen by ﬂoating it on a water surface, mounted 
on a metal grid, and examined under the electron 
microscope. 

Figure  2-9  indicates  the  nomenclature  for  the

Figure 2-9.  Freeze-fracture: Differences between surface and face

Freeze-fracture of a cell membrane splits the bilayer into two leaflets. Each 
leaflet has a surface and a face. The surface of each leaflet faces either the 
extracellular surface (ES) or intracellular or protoplasmic surface (PS).  The 
extracellular and protoplasmic faces (EF and PF) are artificially produced by 
splitting the membrane bilayer along its hydrophobic core. After membrane 
fracture, membrane proteins remain associated to the protoplasmic membrane 
leaflet and appear as particles in the PF replica. The region once occupied by 
the protein shows a complementary pit in the EF replica.

identiﬁcation of surfaces and faces in electron mi-

The surface of the plasma membrane exposed to 
the  extracellular  space  is  labeled  ES,  for  extracel-
lular surface. The surface of the plasma membrane 
exposed to the cytoplasm (also called protoplasm) is 
labeled PS, for protoplasmic surface. 

The face of the membrane leaﬂet looking to the 
extracellular space (the exocytoplasmic leaﬂet in the 
illustration) is labeled EF, for extracellular face. Simi-
larly, the face of the  leaﬂet facing the protoplasmic 
space (identiﬁed as a protoplasmic leaﬂet) is PF, for 
protoplasmic face. 

Now  that  we  have  an  understanding  of  what 
surface and face represent, remember that faces  are 
chemically hydrophobic and surfaces are chemically 
hydrophilic. One last point: Note that a transmem-
brane  protein  stays  with  the  protoplasmic  leaﬂet, 
leaving a complementary pit  in the opposite exo-
cytoplasmic leaﬂet. Why? Cytoskeletal components 
may be directly or indirectly attached to the tip of 
the protein exposed to the cytoplasmic side and will 
not let go.

Transporter and channel proteins 
Most  biological  molecules  cannot  diffuse  through 
the  phospholipid  bilayer.  Speciﬁc  transport  pro-
teins, such as carrier proteins and channel proteins, 
mediate  the  selective  passage  of  molecules  across 
the membrane, thus allowing the cell to control its 
internal composition.

Molecules (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) 
can cross the plasma membrane down their concen-

tration gradient by dissolving ﬁrst in the phospholipid 
bilayer and then in the aqueous environment at the 
cytosolic or extracellular side of the membrane. This 
mechanism,  known  as  passive  diffusion,  does  not 
involve  membrane  proteins.  Lipid  substances  can 
also cross the bilayer.

Other  biological  molecules  (such  as  glucose, 
charged molecules, and small ions H+, Na+, K+  and 
Cl–) are unable to dissolve in the hydrophobic interior 
of the phospholipid bilayer. They require the help of 
speciﬁc transport proteins (Figure 2-10) and chan-
nel proteins, which facilitate the diffusion of most 
biological molecules. 

Similar to passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion of 
biological molecules is determined by concentration 
and electrical gradients across the membrane. How-
ever, facilitated diffusion requires one of the following: 
1. Carrier proteins, which can bind speciﬁc mol-

ecules to be transported.

2. Channel proteins, forming open gates through 

the membrane. 

Carrier  proteins  transport  sugars,  amino  acids 

and nucleosides. 

Channel proteins are ion channels involved in the 
rapid transport of ions (faster transport than carrier 
proteins), are highly selective of molecular size and 
electrical charge, and are not continuously open. 

Some  channels  open  “gates”  in  response  to  the 
binding of a signaling molecule and are called ligand-
gated channels. 

Other  channels  open  in  response  to  changes  in 
electric potential across the membrane and are called 
voltage-gated channels.

Endoplasmic reticulum
The  endoplasmic  reticulum    is  an  interconnected 
network  of  membrane-bound  channels  within  the 
cytoplasm,  part  of  the  cytomembrane  system  and 
distinct from the plasma membrane.

The endoplasmic reticulum system, consisting of 
cisternae (ﬂat sacs), tubules, and vesicles, divides the 
cytoplasm into two compartments: 

1. The luminal or endoplasmic compartment.
2. The cytoplasmic or cytosolic compartment. 

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes 
and is generally in proximity to deposits of glycogen 
and lipids in the cytoplasm. The smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum  has  an  important  role  in  detoxiﬁcation 
reactions  required  for  the  conversion  of  harmful

lipid-soluble or water-insoluble  substances into wa-

by the kidneys. It also participates in steroidogenesis 
(see Chapter 19, Endocrine System).

Products released into the luminal compartment 
of the endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the 
Golgi apparatus by a transporting vesicle and eventu-
ally to the exterior of the cell by exocytosis. 

One can visualize the sequence in which the lu-
men of the cytomembrane system is interconnected 
and remains as such in an imaginary stage; you can 
visualize that the luminal compartment  of a secre-
tory cell is continuous with the exterior of the cell 
(Figure 2-11). The surrounding space is the cytosolic 
compartment in which soluble proteins, cytoskeletal 
components, and organelles are present.

Now, let us visualize the membrane of each com-
ponent of the cytomembrane system as consisting of 
two leaﬂets (Figure 2-12): 

1. The exocytoplasmic leaﬂet (facing the extracel-

lular space).

2. The protoplasmic leaﬂet (facing the cytosolic 

compartment). 

Let us imagine that exocytoplasmic and protoplas-
mic leaﬂets form a continuum. During the freeze-
fracturing process, the knife fractures the membrane 
as it jumps from one fracture plane to the other across 
the hydrophobic core and splits membranes into two 
leaﬂets. The knife cannot stay with a single membrane 
because  cytomembrane-bound  organelles  occupy 
different levels and have random orientations within 
the cell. This randomness will be apparent during the 
examination of the replica. 

The sample may contain a combination of exocy-
toplasmic and protoplasmic leaﬂets which, in turn, 
can expose surfaces and faces.  As you already know, 
membrane proteins tend to remain associated with 
the  protoplasmic  leaﬂet and appear as particles on 
the PF (protoplasmic face). A shallow complemen-
tary pit is visualized in the EF (extracellular face).

Rough endoplasmic reticulum
The  rough  endoplasmic  reticulum    is  recognized 
under  the  light  microscope  as  a  diffuse  basophilic 
cytoplasmic structure called ergastoplasm. 

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is involved in 
the synthesis of proteins, carried out by their attached 
ribosomes (Figure 2-13). In contrast, the membranes 
of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum lack attached 
ribosomes (see Figure 2-13). Most proteins exit the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum in vesicles transported 
to the cis portion of the Golgi apparatus (see Figures 
2-16 and 2-17). Other proteins are retained by the 
rough  endoplasmic  reticulum  to  participate  in  the 
initial  steps  of  protein  synthesis  (see  Figure  2-15). 
The retained proteins contain the targeting sequence

stabilized by golgins,  a family of coiled-coil proteins. 
Each Golgi stack has: 

1. An entry, or cis, face, adjacent to the endoplas-

2.  An  exit,  or  trans,  face,  continuous  with  the 
trans-Golgi  network  (TGN),  pointing  toward  the 
plasma membrane or the nucleus. 

Cisternae of the medial-Golgi are interposed be-

tween the cis-Golgi and the trans-Golgi.   

Cargos derived from the endoplasmic reticulum 
transport soluble proteins and membrane to the cis-
Golgi. Cargo designates newly synthesized membrane 
and proteins destined to be stored within a cell com-
partment or secreted to the cell exterior. 

The material travels through the cisternae by means 
of transport vesicles that bud off from one cisterna 
and tether and fuse with the next in the presence of 
golgins. Golgins form an appendicular network on 
the cis-Golgi, around the rims of the sacs and on the 
trans-Golgi, with roles in Golgi structure stabilization 
and vesicle trafﬁcking. 

Finally, vesicle cargos translocate from the trans-
Golgi to the TGN, the tubular-vesicular distribution 
center of cargos to the cell surface or to another cel-
lular compartment (for example, lysosomes).

The  Golgi  apparatus  undergoes  a  permanent 
turnover. It disassembles during mitosis/meiosis and 
reassembles in interphase. 

Functions of the Golgi apparatus  
Three  speciﬁc  functions  are  carried  by  the  Golgi 
apparatus: 

1.  Modiﬁcation  of  carbohydrates  attached  to 
glycoproteins and proteoglycans received from the 
endoplasmic reticulum. This process is called glyco-
sylation. A characteristic glycosylation event within 
the Golgi is the modiﬁcation of N-linked oligosac-
charides on glycoproteins. More than 200 enzymes 
participate in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and 
glycolipids  in  the  Golgi  apparatus. The  enzymes 
called glycosyltransferases add speciﬁc sugar residues; 
the enzymes called glycosidases remove speciﬁc sugar 
residues. 

2. Sorting of cargos to several destinations within 
the cell. We discuss in another section of this chapter 
how the Golgi apparatus marks speciﬁc proteins for 
sorting to lysosomes. 

3. The  synthesis  of  sphingomyelin  and  glyco-

sphingolipids.

Once  processed,  cargos  bud  off  from  the  Golgi 
apparatus and are either sorted to the secretory of 
lysosomal  sorting  pathway  (anterograde  trafﬁc) 
or back to the endoplasmic reticulum (retrograde 
trafﬁc) (see Figure 2-16). 

Certain classes of cargos are stored into secretory 
granules for later release in response to an extracel-

The  role  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  in  protein 
synthesis and sorting was demonstrated by incubat-
ing pancreatic acinar cells in a medium containing 
radiolabeled amino acids and localizing radiolabeled 
proteins by autoradiography. 

The secretory pathway taken by secretory proteins 
includes the following sequence: rough endoplasmic 
reticulum, to Golgi apparatus, to secretory vesicles, to 
the extracellular space or lumen (Figure 2-14). Plasma 
membrane  and  lysosomal  proteins  also  follow  the 
sequence of rough endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi 
apparatus but are retained within the cell. 

Proteins targeted to the nucleus, mitochondria, or 
peroxisomes are synthesized on free ribosomes and 
then released into the cytosol. In contrast, proteins for 
secretion or targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, 
Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, or plasma membrane are 
synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes and then 
transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum as protein 
synthesis progresses.

Ribosomes attach to the endoplasmic reticulum 
under the guidance of the amino acid sequence of 
the polypeptide chain being synthesized. Ribosomes 
synthesizing proteins for secretion are directed to the 
endoplasmic reticulum by a signal sequence at the 
growing end of the polypeptide chain. 

The mechanism by which secretory proteins are 
directed to the endoplasmic reticulum is explained 
by the signal hypothesis (Figure 2-15).

Golgi apparatus 
 The Golgi apparatus consists of a cluster of ﬂattened 
stacks of sacs called cisternae (Figures 2-16 and 2-17)

regulated  secretion.  Other  cargos  can  be  secreted 
continuously  without  a  need  of  a  stimulus. This 
mechanism is called constitutive secretion; it sup-
plies  newly  synthesized  lipids  and  proteins  to  the 

plasma membrane or proteins to be released outside 
the cell such as proteins of the extracellular matrix or 
immunoglobulins during immune reactions.

    When cells were labeled with a radioactive amino

localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum       .  
    Later on, the radiolabeled proteins were found to 
translocate to the Golgi apparatus       and then, within 
secretory vesicles as zymogen granules      , to the 
plasma membrane and the extracellular space      .

ence of speciﬁc lipids domains in the membrane of 
a vesicle cargo recruit coating proteins and tethering 
golgins to sort the cargo in the direction of an accep-
tor membrane site. Essentially, the sorting and trans-
port of cargos depend on specialized coats preparing 
the cargo to be moved along the cytoskeleton by mo-
lecular motor proteins. Tethering golgins (coiled-coil 
proteins) attach the cargo to the cytoskeleton. When 
the vesicle cargo reaches an acceptor membrane, it 
fuses with the help of fusion proteins.

Vesicle transport
Vesicle transport involves the mobilization of proteins 
and  membrane  between  cytomembrane  compart-
ments. The exocytosis or secretory pathway starts 
in the endoplasmic reticulum, continues through the 
Golgi apparatus, and ends on the cell surface. The 
endocytic  pathway  consists  in  the  internalization 
and degradation of extracellular material from the 
plasma membrane, through endosomes to lysosomes. 
These two events depend on distinctive proteins 
coating the cytosolic side of the membrane of the 
transport vesicle that becomes a coated vesicle. The 
coat helps the recruitment of molecules for transport. 
Before fusion with the acceptor membrane, the vesicle 
sheds its coat, allowing the membranes to interact 
directly and fuse. 

Transport vesicles are coated by the protein clathrin. 
Clathrin-coated  vesicles  are  seen  in  the  exocytosis/
secretory and endocytosis pathway. 

In the endocytosis pathway (Figure 2-18), vesicles 
start at the plasma membrane as clathrin-coated pits. 
Clathrin molecules assemble in a basket-like arrange-
ment on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane 
and the pit shape changes into a vesicle. 

Dynamin, a small GTP-binding protein, surrounds 
the neck of the invaginated coated pit, causing the 
neck  of  the  vesicle  to  pinch  off  from  the  plasma 
membrane. A second class of coat proteins are the 
adaptins. Adaptins stabilize the clathrin coat to the 
vesicle membrane and assist in the selection of cargos 
for transport by binding to cargo receptors on the 
vesicle membrane. When the cargo reaches the target 
acceptor membrane, the coat proteins are shed and 
the membranes can fuse.

Sorting of clathrin-coated vesicles and COP-coated 
vesicles  
A continual process of budding and fusion of trans-
port vesicles mobilizes products from the endoplasmic 
reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (anterograde trafﬁc), 
between membranous stacks of the Golgi apparatus, 
and  from  the  Golgi  apparatus  to  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum (retrograde trafﬁc) (see Figure 2-16).

       The synthesis of a protein starts with a leading signal peptide. A 
signal recognition particle (SRP) binds to the ribosome and stops 
further growth of the protein. The complex is anchored to the cytoplasmic 
side of the endoplasmic reticulum cisterna where SRP binds to the SRP 
receptor.  After binding, SRP is removed from the complex.
      The protein reinitiates its growth and the leading peptide crosses the

       Signal peptidase removes the leading peptide and protein

The vesicular transport mechanism involves two 

types of coated vesicles (Figure 2-19):

1. Clathrin-coated vesicles, transporting products 
from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes, and carrying 
products from the exterior of the cell to lysosomes 
(for example, cholesterol; see Figure 2-18).

2.  COP-coated  vesicles  (COP  stands  for  coat 
protein), transporting products between stacks of the 
Golgi apparatus (COPI-coated vesicles), and from 
the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus 
(COPII-coated vesicles).

We have already seen that adaptins mediate the 
binding of clathrin to the vesicular membrane as well 
as select speciﬁc molecules to be trapped in a vesicle. 

What about COP-coated vesicles? 

A guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein 
called  ARF  (for  adenosine  diphosphate  [ADP]-
ribosylation factor), is required for the assembly of 
COPI and COPII molecules to form a protein coat 
called a coatomer on the cytosolic side of a transport-
ing vesicle.  

When GTP is converted to guanosine diphosphate 
(GDP) by hydrolysis, the coatomer dissociates from 
the vesicle just before the vesicle fuses with a target 
membrane. ARF is related to Ras proteins, a group 
of oncogene proteins also regulated by the alternate 
binding  of  GTP  and  GDP  (see  the  MAP  kinase 
pathway in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).

The cisterna closest to the endoplasmic reticulum is the cis-Golgi, whereas 
the cisterna closest to the apical domain of the cell is the trans-Golgi.  
Cisterna of the medial-Golgi are in between the cis-Golgi and the 
trans-Golgi. The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the sorting site of vesicles or 
cargos. Transporting vesicles bud from one stack and fuse with the next in an 
anterograde traffic (endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi) or retrograde traffic 
(Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum). Golgins stabilize cisternae and vesicles.

Vesicle  fusion  to  a  target  membrane:  NSF  and 
SNARE proteins
The fusion of a transporting vesicle to a target mem-
brane (Figure 2-20) requires the recognition  of the 
speciﬁc target membrane so the vesicle and target 
membranes can fuse to deliver the transported cargo.
 Vesicle fusion is mediated by two interacting cyto-
solic proteins: NSF (for N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive 
fusion)  and  SNAPs  (for  soluble  NSF  attachment 
proteins).  NSF  and  SNAP  bind  to  speciﬁc  mem-
brane receptors called SNARE (for SNAP receptors).  
SNAREs  are  present  on  the  transporting  vesicle 
(v-SNARE) and target membranes (t-SNARE) and 
represent docking proteins.  Following docking, the 
SNARE complex recruits NSF and SNAPs to produce 
the fusion of the vesicle and target membranes.

Lysosomal sorting pathway: M6P and its receptor  
Lysosomal hydrolases are synthesized in the endo-
plasmic reticulum, transported to the cis-Golgi, and 
ﬁnally sorted to lysosomes. This sorting mechanism 
involves two important steps (Figure 2-21): 

1. The  insertion  in  the  cis-Golgi  of  mannose-
6-phosphate (M6P) into oligosaccharides attached 
to glycoproteins destined to lysosomes. 

2. The presence in the TGN of the transmembrane 

M6P receptor protein in the sorting vesicle.

By  this  mechanism,  M6P-containing  lysosomal 
enzymes are separated from other glycoproteins in 
vesicles  with  the  M6P  receptor.  After  being  trans-
ported  to  a  clathrin-coated  transporting  vesicle, 
lysosomal enzymes dissociate from the M6P receptor 
and become surrounded by a membrane to form a 
lysosome. Membranes containing  free M6P receptor 
are returned to the Golgi apparatus for recycling.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis: Cholesterol
uptake 
Receptor-mediated endocytosis  increases the capac-
ity of the cell to internalize speciﬁc macromolecules 
with great efﬁciency and in large amount. A classic 
example is the uptake of cholesterol used to make new 
cell membranes. As you recall from your biochemistry 
course, cholesterol is highly insoluble and is mobilized 
in the bloodstream bound to protein as low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) particles. LDL carries about 75% 
of the cholesterol and circulates in blood for about 
2 to 3 days. Approximately 70% of LDL is cleared 
from blood by cells containing LDL receptors; the 
remainder is removed by a scavenger pathway using 
a receptor-independent mechanism.

The internalization of a ligand (such as LDL, trans-
ferrin, polypeptide hormones, or growth factors) by a 
cell requires a speciﬁc membrane receptor. The LDL

The Golgi apparatus is visualized under the electron microscope 
as a series of curved flattened saccules or cisternae stacked upon 
one another. The ends of the saccules are dilated and can form 
spherical vesicles. The saccules and vesicles contain proteins being 
glycosylated for further secretion or sorting. 

  The Golgi apparatus consists of four major functionally distinct 
compartments:

1. The cis-Golgi is the entry site to the Golgi apparatus of 
products derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. 
2. The trans-Golgi is the exit site of cargos.
3. The medial-Golgi is interposed between the cis-Golgi and 
the trans-Golgi. 
4. The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the sorting site of cargos 
for transport to lysosomes or secretion (exocytosis).

receptor–LDL complex is internalized by receptor-
mediated endocytosis.  We have seen that this process 
involves the assembly of the protein clathrin on the 
cytosolic side of the plasma membrane, which forms 
a coated pit (see Figure 2-18). 

The function of clathrin, together with adaptin, is 
to concentrate  receptor-ligand complexes in a small 
surface area of the plasma membrane. Receptors with 
their bound ligands move by lateral diffusion in the 

plane of the lipid bilayer.  The coated pit invaginates 
to  form  a  coated  vesicle,  which  pinches  off  from 
the plasma membrane to transport receptor-ligand 
complexes to a speciﬁc intracellular pathway, usually 
an endosome. Recall that dynamin assembles around 
the neck of the budding coated vesicle to pinch off 
the vesicle from the plasma membrane with the help 
of other proteins recruited to the neck site. 

After internalization, clathrin of the coated vesicle

changes into a secondary lysosome engaged in sub-
strate degradation. LDL is broken down by lysosomal 
hydrolytic enzymes and is released into the cytosol 
as  free  cholesterol,  where  it  can  be  used  for  new 
membrane synthesis.

The LDL receptor, in turn, is continuously recycled 
back to the plasma membrane to be used again. The 
LDL receptor can recycle every 10 minutes and can 
make several hundred cycles in its 20-hour life span.  
Cholesterol is required for the synthesis of steroid 
hormones, the production of bile acids in liver hepa-
tocytes, and the synthesis of cell membranes. 

 Box 2-C | Macroautophagy and autophagy

•  There are  different types of autophagy. Macroautophagy (commonly referred 
to autophagy) is non-selective and consists in the random sequestration, degra-
dation and recycling of intracellular components into double-membraned autopha-
gosomes. Autophagy is a selective process deﬁned by the type of material being 
delivered across the lysosomal membrane (chaperone-mediated autophagy).   
•  Non-selective macroautophagy and selective autophagy use proteins encoded 
by autophagy-related (Atg) genes to form autophagosomes that fuse with lyso-
somes to become degradative autolysosomes.  
•  Tumor cells induce autophagy in response to starvation or damaging stress 
to promote cell survival.  This particular aspect suggests that inhibition of the 
mechanism of autophagy could be useful to improve cancer therapy. Alternatively, 
defective chronic autophagy may lead to a damaging tissue inﬂammatory state 
conducive to tumor development, an important aspect of cancer prevention.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Familial hypercholesterolemia
The  mechanism  of  cholesterol  uptake  is  disrupted 
in  familial  hypercholesterolemia,  characterized  by 
an  elevation  of  LDL,  the  predominant  cholesterol 
transport protein in the plasma. The primary defect is 
a mutation in the gene encoding the LDL receptor, 
required for the internalization of dietary cholesterol 
by  most  cells.  High  levels  of    LDL  cholesterol  in 
blood plasma lead to the formation of atherosclerotic 
plaques in the coronary vessels, a common cause of
myocardial infarction.

Patients  with  familial  hypercholesterolemia  have 

three types of defective receptors: 

1.  LDL  receptors  incapable  of  binding  LDL. 
   2.  LDL receptors that bind LDL but at a reduced 
capacity.

3.  LDL receptors that can bind LDL normally but 

are incapable of internalization.

Lysosomes  
Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles of hetero-
geneous size and morphology that contain acid hydro-
lases. Lysosomes are regarded as the end degradation 
compartment  of  the  endocytic  pathway  and  also 
participate in the digestion of intracellular material 
during the non-selective process of macroautophagy, 
commonly referred to autophagy (see Box 2-C). In 
addition, lysosomes function as secretory organelles 
in response to external stimulation (see Box 2-D)

Two types of lysosomes are recognized:

Vesicular transport consists of:
   1. The formation of a vesicle by budding from a membrane.
   2. The assembly of a protein coat on the cytosolic surface of  
       transport vesicles. 
   There are two types of coated vesicles:
   1. Clathrin-coated, found in endocytic vesicles and vesicles  
       sorted from the trans-Golgi network to a lysosome.
   2.  COP-coated vesicles (COP stands for coat protein),  
       observed in transporting vesicles between stacks of the Golgi  
      apparatus (COPI-coated vesicles) or from the endoplasmic   
      reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (COPII-coated vesicles).

 

COP assembly is regulated by two different mechanisms:
   1.  Clathrin binding to a vesicle is mediated by adaptins.
   2.  COP binding to a vesicle is mediated by GTP-bound ARF.        
        The coatomer sheds when GTP hydrolysis changes ARF-GTP   
        bound to ARF-GDP-bound. Then, the vesicle fuses with the  
        acceptor or target membrane.
   ARF is a member of the Ras protein family (involved as 
oncogenes in cancer; see the MAP kinase pathway in Chapter 3, 
Cell Signaling). 
   Ras-related proteins (called Rab proteins) are also involved in 
vesicular transport.

primary storage site of lysosomal hydrolases.

2.  Secondary    lysosomes  (corresponding  to 
phagolysosomes  and  autolysosomes),  regarded  as 
lysosomes engaged in a substrate degradation process.  
As discussed, the plasma membrane can internal-
ize  extracellular  particles  and  ﬂuids  using  vesicles 
resulting from the invagination of the membrane by 
a process called endocytosis.  Endocytosis has two 
important goals: to bring material into the cell, and 
to recycle the plasma membrane. The reverse process, 

called exocytosis, is the transport outside the cell of 
products processed or synthesized by the cell.

Endocytosis involves three major types of vesicles:
1. Clathrin-free phagosomes, used to internalize 
large particles (for example, virus, bacteria, or cell 
debris).

2. Clathrin-coated vesicles, to take in small mac-

romolecules.

3.  Pinocytosis  (cellular  drinking),  to  internalize 
ﬂuids in a vesicle called caveola coated by caveolin.

10,  Immune-Lymphatic  System  (macrophages  and 
antigen-presenting  cells).  Phagocytic  cells  scavenge 
cell remnants during apoptosis and aging blood cells 
in spleen. 

In addition to hydrolytic enzymes, the lysosome 
has  membrane-bound  transporters  that  allow  di-
gested  products,  such  as  amino  acids,  sugars,  and 
nucleotides, to reach the cytosol for reuse or excretion. 
The  lysosomal  membrane  also  contains  an  ATP-
dependent pump that provides H+ into the lysosome 
to maintain an acidic environment (see Figure 2-22). 
We now review the lysosomal sorting pathway (see  

Figure 2-21) to highlight important steps: 

1. Lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal membrane 
proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum  and  transported  through  the  Golgi  apparatus 
to the TGN.

2. An important event in the cis-Golgi is the tagging 
of lysosomal enzymes with a speciﬁc phosphorylated 
sugar group, M6P, that is recognized in membranes of 
the trans-Golgi region by the corresponding receptor, 
M6P receptor.

3. The tagging enables enzymes to be sorted and 
packaged into transport vesicles that leave the TGN 
network toward the lysosomes.

There is a coordinated genetic control of lysosomal 
biogenesis. The transcription factor TFEB (for tran-
scription factor EB) regulates the expression of several 
lysosomal genes and also coordinates the formation 
of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes. 
Overexpression of TFEB increases the formation of 
new lysosomes during starvation and autophagy.

Phagocytosis, endocytosis, and macroautophagy
The different endocytic pathways of various materials 
to lysosomes are illustrated in Figure 2-22. Note some 
important events and corresponding terminology:  
1. Lysosomes can fuse with endosomes, autopha-
gosomes and phagosomes to form a hybrid organelle 
(a secondary lysosome) by mixing their contents so 
the bulk of the endocytic cargo can be degraded. 

2. Endocytic vesicles fuse with early endosomes 
and late endosomes before cargo delivery to a lyso-
some. Endosomes lack M6P receptor, a distinction 
from lysosomes. 

3. The fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes 
results in a depletion of lysosomes.  Lysosomes are 
recovered from the hybrid organelle by the removal 
of late endosome constituents. Small vesicular struc-
tures with lysosomal protease content in the presence 
of proton-pumping ATPase and Ca2+ bud off from

Lysosomes

Lysosomes are organelles, which contain about 40 types of 
hydrolytic enzymes active in an acidic environment (pH ~5.0). Their 
function is to degrade proteins, nucleic acids, oligosaccharides, 
and phospholipids.

   The surrounding membrane has three characteristics: 
   1. It separates hydrolytic enzymes from the cytosol. 
   2. It harbors transport proteins (LIMPs, LAMPs, and NPC1) that 
translocate hydrolases into the lysosome (LIMPs and LAMPs) and  
with a role in lysosomal cholesterol efflux (NPC1). 
3. It contains an ATP-dependent H+ pump to maintain an acidic 
intralysosomal environment.

   There are three major pathways for the intracellular degradation 
of materials. Extracellular  particles can be taken up by 
phagocytosis and endocytosis. Aged intracellular components are 
degraded by macroautophagy, a non-selective process.

      Phagocytosis: The material that is phagocytosed is enclosed 
1
within a phagosome, which then fuses with a lysosome to form a 
phagolysosome. Abundant phagosomes are observed in 
macrophages.     
      Endocytosis: The material that is endocytosed is delivered to an 
2
early endosome and then to a late endosome. The membrane of a 
late endosome contains the H+ pump, the early endosome does not. 
A lysosome fuses with the late endosome (hybrid organelle) to begin 
its catalytic function.  Endocytosis is characteristic of receptor-
mediated endocytosis of polypeptide hormones and growth factors. A 
residual body is a structure containing partially digested material.
      Macroautophagy: Macroautophagy starts with the endoplasmic 
3
reticulum enclosing an aged cell component to form an 
autophagosome, which then fuses with a lysosome to form a hybrid 
autolysosome and its content is digested.

Gangliosides are sphingolipids rich in 
carbohydrates predominant in the nervous 
system. Gangliosides are degraded inside 
lysosomes by removing their terminal sugars. 
   In Tay-Sachs disease, the content of 
ganglioside M2 (GM2) in the brain is high 
because the removal of the terminal 
N-acetylgalactosamine is slow or it does not 
occur. The missing lysosomal enzyme is   
(cid:96)-N-acetylhexosaminidase. 
   Affected neurons contain lipids within 
lysosomes. Retarded psychomotor 
development and weakness are early 
symptoms. Dementia, blindness, and death 
usually occur within 3 years after birth.    
Amniocentesis to assay for  
(cid:96)-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity during 
prenatal development can diagnose the 
inherited autosomal recessive disease.

Lysosomal storage disorders

                                                                              
The hydrolytic enzymes within lysosomes are involved in the 
breakdown of sphingolipids, glycoproteins, and glycoproteins into 
soluble products. These molecular complexes can derive from the 
turnover of intracellular organelles or enter the cell by phagocytosis.

   A number of genetic diseases lacking lysosomal enzymes result in 
the progressive accumulation within the cell of partially degraded 
insoluble products. This condition leads to clinical conditions known 
as lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). 

   These disorders include broad categories depending on the major 
accumulating insoluble product and the substrate for the defective 
lysosomal enzyme. 

   The deficient breakdown of sphingolipids is the cause of: 
   1. Gaucher's disease, characterized by defective activity of a 
glucocerebrosidase, resulting in the accumulation of 
glucocerebrosides in the spleen and central nervous system.
   2. Niemann-Pick disease, defined by a defective 
sphingomyelinase, leading to the accumulation of sphingomyelin 
and cholesterol in the spleen and central nervous system.
   3. Tay-Sachs disease, characterized by a deficiency of  (cid:3)
(cid:96)-N-acetylhexosaminidase, resulting in the accumulation of 
gangliosides in the central nervous system.
   The diagnosis of these three lysosomal storage disorders is 
based on the detection of enzymatic activity in leukocytes and 
cultured fibroblasts of the patients.

Gaucher’s disease 
(or glucosylceramide lipidosis) is 
characterized by three forms:
   Type 1 does not have a neurologic  
component and occurs in late childhood 
or adolescence. It affects bone, liver, 
spleen (see histologic image) and lungs.
   Type 2 occurs early one, at 2 to 3 
months of age, is associated with 
neurologic symptoms and death usually 
occurs by 2 years of age.
   Type 3 is seen in the adult, is 
associated with hepatosplenomegaly 
and has a neurologic component. Death 
occurs by the fourth decade.

5.  Macroautophagy  involves  the  degradation  of 
cytoplasmic components of the cell itself enclosed 
in an autophagosome that fuses with a lysosome to 
form a hybrid autolysosome. 

Note  that  autophagosomes  are  structures  with 
a  double  membrane. The  sequestered  cytoplasmic 

material is degraded into small molecules transported 
across  the  lysosomal  membrane  to  the  cytosol  for 
reuse (for example, the production of new proteins). 
Autophagy is essential for cell survival and cell homeo-
stasis. We discuss molecular aspects of authophagy in 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Lysosomal storage disorders 
Lysosomal storage disorders or diseases (LSDs) are 
caused by the progressive accumulation of cell mem-
brane components within cells because of a hereditary 
deﬁciency of enzymes required for their breakdown.
 Loss of function mutations in proteins critical for 
lysosomal function (such as lysosomal enzymes, lyso-
somal integral membrane proteins, proteins involved 
in post-translational modiﬁcations and trafﬁcking of 
lysosomal proteins) cause substrate accumulation and 
lysosomal storage defects. 

Two-thirds of LSDs lead to neuronal dysfunction 
and neurodegeneration. Many affected individuals 
are clinically normal at birth, an indication that im-
paired lysosomal function does not affect neuronal 
function during early brain development. 

You may like to focus again on Figure 2-21 and 
Figure  2-22  to  review  the  pathway  followed  by 
hydrolytic enzymes to reach the lysosome and the 
highlights  of  the  sequence  steps  of  endocytosis, 
phagocytosis  and  macroautophagy. These  cellular 
trafﬁcking pathways are the bases for understanding 
the  clinical  value  of  substrate  reduction  therapy 
(SRT; using inhibitors to block substrate synthesis), 
and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; utilizing the 
membrane-associated M6P receptor for the uptake 
of  lysosomal  enzymes  into  cells  after  intravenous 
administration). 

An important pathologic concept to grasp is that 
defective lysosomal enzyme carriers, rather than the 
lysosomal storage material itself, can account for 
the cellular pathologies in LSDs. Essentially, not all 
lysosomal diseases are storage disorders. 

For example, a deﬁciency in the lysosomal integral 

 Box 2-D | Secretory lysosomes

•  Some cell types can store and secrete lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes. An 
example is the osteoclast, a cell involved in bone resorption following the re-
lease of the enzyme cathepsin K from a lysosomal compartment into the acidic 
environment created by an H+-ATPase pump within the Howship’s lacuna (see 
Chapter 4, Connective Tissue). 
•  Secretory lysosomes are found in cells of the immune system. CD8+ cytolytic 
T cells and natural killer cells secrete the pore-forming protein perforin by 
means of secretory lysosomes to destroy target cells (see Chapter 10, Immune-
Lymphatic System).  
•  Melanocytes have melanosomes, lysosomal-related organelles transporting 
melanin to keratinocytes to produce skin and hair pigmentation (see Chapter 
11, Integumentary System).
•  A number of autosomal human genetic diseases give rise to immune dysfunc-
tion and defects in pigmentation (for example, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and 
Griscelli syndrome 1 (see Chapter 11, Integumentary System).

membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2), with binding 
afﬁnity to the lysosomal enzyme (cid:96)-glucocerebrosidase 
((cid:96)-Glc) in the endoplasmic reticulum and involved in 
the transport of (cid:96)-Glc to the lysosome, is deﬁcient in 
Gaucher disease. Consequently, LIMP-2 mutations 
determine a reduction in lysosomal (cid:96)-Glc activity.

Furthermore, the microscopic analysis of biopsied 
tissues  and  biochemical  evaluation  of  accumulated 
cellular  substrates  can  determine  the  underlying 
enzymatic defects of lysosomal storage material. For 
example, deﬁciencies in the proteins Niemann-Pick 
disease type C1 and C3 (NPC1 and NPC2), required 
for  the  release  of  cholesterol  from  the  lysosome, 
causes  cholesterol  accumulation  in  Niemann-Pick 
disease. In other words, although the precise transport 
mechanism is sometimes not entirely clear, a cellular 
storage defect can often offer clues for SRT and ERT 
clinical strategies.

Additional  details  on  the  mechanism  leading  to 
Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis), character-
ized by an increased in brain weight due to gliosis 
(proliferation  of  glial  cells  in  response  to  damage 
of  the  central  nervous  system),  neuronal  atrophy 
(caused by abnormal whorled lysosomes displacing 
the  nucleus)  and  axonal  defects  abnormalities  in 
myelin), are presented in Figure 2-23.

Mitochondria
The mitochondrion  (Greek mito, thread; chondrion, 
granule) is a highly compartmentalized organelle. The 
primary  function  of  mitochondria  is  to  house  the 
enzymatic machinery for oxidative phosphorylation 
resulting in the production of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) and the release of energy from the metabolism 
of molecules.  

A  mitochondrion  consists  of  an  outer  mito-
chondrial membrane and an inner mitochondrial 
membrane  creating  an  intermembrane  space  be-
tween them (Figure 2-24). The inner mitochondrial 
membrane surrounds a large compartment called the 
matrix. The matrix is partitioned by infoldings of 
the inner mitochondrial membrane known as cristae. 
Cristae amplify the inner mitochondrial membrane 
on which ATP synthesis takes place. 

Mitochondria contain DNA and RNA, including 
ribosomes to synthesize some of their own proteins 
in the matrix. Only 1% of mitochondrial proteins 
are encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Most of mi-
tochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, 
synthesized in cytosol  ribosomes and imported into 
mitochondria by targeting signals that are recognized 
by the translocase of the outer mitochondrial mem-
brane complex (TOM) on the outer mitochondrial 
membrane. TOM is the most common entry route 
of imported mitochondrial proteins. Targeting poly-
peptide signals and chaperones (Hsp60 and Hsp70)

1      Pyruvate and fatty acids are transported from the cytosol to the 
mitochondria across the outer mitochondrial membrane and 
converted in the mitochondrial matrix into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl 
CoA) by enzymes of the citric acid cycle. CO2 is released from the 
cell as waste metabolic product. Porins are permeable aqueous 
channels located along the outer mitochondrial membrane.

      The citric acid cycle generates high-energy electrons carried by 
2
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine 
dinucleotide (FADH2). These carriers donate their high-energy 
electrons to the electron-transport chain located in the inner 
mitochondrial membrane. High-energy electrons produced during the 
citric acid cycle are utilized by the electron-transport chain 
complexes (I, II, III, and IV) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

      The electrons pass along the chain to molecular oxygen (O2) to 
3
form water (H2O). Four electrons and four H+ added to each molecule 
of O2 for two molecules of H2O.
 
     As electrons travel through the chain, energy in the form of protons 
4
(H+) is released across the inner membrane into the intermembrane 
space. The resulting H+ gradient drives ATP synthesis by ATP 
synthase (V) utilizing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and Pi coming 
from the cytosol. ATP produced in the mitochondrial matrix is 
released into the cytosol. 

     Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) is the 
5
common entry gate of precursor proteins encoded by the cell nucleus. 
After passing through the TOM complex, the precursos use different 
mitochondrial pathways.   

enable proteins to reach the matrix (Figure 2-25).

The  outer  mitochondrial  membrane  is  perme-
able. It contains porins, proteins that form aqueous 
channels permeable to water-soluble molecules with 
a reduced molecular mass (less than 5 kd), such as 
sugars, amino acids and ions. The inner mitochon-
drial  membrane  is  impermeable  to  the  passage  of 
ions and small molecules.

The inner mitochondrial membrane is the site of 
electron-transport and proton (H+) pumping and 
contains the ATP synthase.  Most of the proteins 
embedded  in  the  inner  mitochondrial  membrane 

are  components  of  the  electron-transport  chain, 
involved in oxidative phosphorylation. 

The mechanism of ATP synthesis is called oxida-
tive phosphorylation. It consists in the addition of 
a phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
to form ATP and the utilization of O2.  It is also 
called chemiosmotic because it involves a chemical 
component (the synthesis of ATP) and an osmotic 
component (the electron-transport and H+ pump-
ing process).  

The mitochondrial matrix contains pyruvate (de-
rived from carbohydrates) and fatty acids (derived

from fat). These two small molecules are selectively 
transported  across  the  inner  mitochondrial  mem-
brane  and  then  converted  to  acetyl  coenzyme  A 
(acetyl CoA) in the matrix. 

The citric acid cycle converts acetyl CoA to CO2 
(released from the cell as waste metabolic product) 
and high-energy electrons, carried by nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NADH)– and ﬂavin adenine 
dinucleotide (FADH2)–activated carrier molecules.

NADH and FADH2 donate high-energy electrons 
to the electron-transport chain lodged in the inner 
mitochondrial membrane and become oxidized to 
NAD+ and FAD. The electrons travel rapidly along 
the transport chain to O2 to form water (H2O).

  As  the  high-energy  electrons  travel  along  the 
electron-transport chain, energy is released by pro-
ton  pumps  as  H+  across  the  inner  mitochondrial 
membrane into the intermembrane space. The H+

gradient then drives the synthesis of ATP. 

Note that:
1. The inner mitochondrial membrane converts 
the energy derived from the high-energy electrons 
of NADH into a different type of energy: the high-
energy phosphate bond of ATP. 

2.  The  electron-transport  chain  (or  respiratory 
chain) contributes to the consumption of O2 as a 
phosphate group is added to ADP to form ATP.  

The components of the electron-transport chain 
are present in many copies embedded in the lipid 
bilayer of the inner mitochondrial membrane. They 
are  grouped  into  three  large  respiratory  enzyme 
complexes in the receiving order of electrons:

1. The NADH dehydrogenase complex.
2. The cytochrome b-c1 complex.
3. The cytochrome oxidase complex. 
Each complex is a system that pumps H+ across the 
inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermem-
brane space as electrons travel through the complex.  
If this mechanism did not exist, the energy released 
during electron transfer would produce heat. 

Cyanide and azide are poisons that bind to cyto-
chrome oxidase complexes to stop electron transport, 
thereby blocking ATP production.   

Cytochrome  c  is  a  small  protein  that  shuttles 
electrons between the cytochrome b-c1 complex and 
the cytochrome oxidase complex. 

When the cytochrome oxidase complex receives 
electrons from cytochrome c, it becomes oxidized 
and  donates  electrons  to  O2  to  form  H2O.  Four 
electrons from cytochrome c and four H+ from the 
aqueous environment are added to each molecule of 
O2 to form 2H2O. 

The H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial 
membrane  is  used  to  steer  ATP  synthesis.  ATP 
synthase is a large enzyme embedded in the inner 
mitochondrial membrane involved in ATP synthesis.
H+ ﬂow back across the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane down the electrochemical gradient through 
a hydrophilic route within ATP synthase to drive 
the reaction between ADP and Pi to produce ATP.  
This  reaction  takes  place  in  the  enzymatic 
component  of  ATP  synthase  projecting  into  the 
mitochondrial  matrix  like  a  lollipop  head.  About 
100  molecules  of  ATP  are  produced  per  second. 
About  three  H+  cross  the  ATP  synthase  to  form 
each molecule of ATP.  ADP molecules produced by 
ATP hydrolysis in the cytosol are drawn back into 
mitochondria for recharging to ATP.  ATP molecules 
produced in the mitochondrial matrix are released 
into the cytosol for their use. 

Mitochondria participate in apoptosis, steroidogen-
esis, and thermogenesis
Mitochondria participate in three signiﬁcant func-
tions: 

1. Programmed cell death or apoptosis.
2.  Steroidogenesis  (production  of  steroid  hor-

mones).

3. Thermogenesis. 
Concerning  apoptosis,  mitochondria  contain 
procaspases-2, -3, and -9 (precursors of proteolytic 
enzymes), apoptosis initiation factor (AIF), and cyto-
chrome c. The release of these proteins in the cytosol 
initiates apoptosis. We come back to mitochondria 
and apoptosis in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling.

With  regard  to  steroidogenesis,  mitochondrial 
membranes contain enzymes involved in the synthesis 
of the steroids aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens. 
We discuss the participation of mitochondria in ste-
roid production in Chapter 19, Endocrine System, 
and Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis.

Concerning  thermogenesis,  most  of  the  en-
ergy from oxidation is dissipated as heat rather than 
converted  to  ATP.    Uncoupling  proteins  (UCPs),  
members of the superfamily of mitochondrial anion-
carrier proteins present in the mitochondrial inner 
membrane,  mediate  the  regulated  discharge  of  H+ 
(called proton leak), resulting in the release of heat. 
Proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane  
is mediated by UCP-1.   

UCP-1  is  present  in  the  mitochondrial  inner 
membrane of brown adipocytes. Its role is to me-
diate  regulated  thermogenesis  in  response  to  cold 
exposure (see section on adipose tissue in Chapter 4, 
Connective Tissue).  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Mitochondrial maternal 
inheritance
Mitochondrial  DNA  (mtDNA)  is  transmitted  by 
the mother (maternal inheritance). Both males and 
females can be affected by mitochondrial diseases, but 
males seem unable to transmit the disorder to the off-
spring. Maternal inheritance of  mtDNA is regarded 
as  an  evolutionary  advantageous  event  because  of 
the potential damage of mtDNA by reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) involved in fertilization. 

Motile sperm reaching the oviduct for fertilization 
eliminate their mtDNA before fertilization, leaving 
vacuolar mitochondria. Yet, residual mtDNA in the 
fertilizing sperm can be unevenly distributed in the 
zygote  during  early  embryo  development.  Conse-
quently, paternal mtDNA inheritance effects cannot 
be disregarded. 

Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red ﬁbers ( MERRF) 
is  characterized  by  generalized  muscle  weakness, 
loss of  coordination (ataxia), and multiple seizures. 
The major complications are respiratory and cardiac 
failure because the respiratory and cardiac muscles 
are affected. Muscle cells and neurons are the most 
affected because of their need for signiﬁcant amounts 
of ATP to function.

       Zellweger syndrome, one of the four diseases within

the group of peroxisome biogenesis disorders, is a fatal 
condition caused by the defective assembly of peroxisomes 
due to mutations in genes encoding PEX1, PEX2, PEX3, 
PEX5, PEX6, and PEX12. 
   Newly synthesized peroxisomal enzymes remain in the 
cytosol and eventually are degraded. Cells in patients with 
Zellweger syndrome contain empty peroxisomes. 

       Catalase, the major protein of the peroxisome, decomposes H2O2 into 
3
H2O. 
   Catalase is a tetramer of apocatalase molecules assembled within the 
peroxisome. 
   Heme is added to each monomer to prevent it from moving back into the 
cytosol across the peroxisomal membrane. 
   Peroxisomes are abundant in the liver (hepatocytes).

Histologic preparations of  muscle biopsies of indi-
viduals with MERRF display a peripheral red-stained 
material corresponding to aggregates of abnormal 
mitochondria,  giving  a  ragged  appearance  to  red 
muscle ﬁbers. MERRF is caused by a point mutation 
in a mitochondrial DNA gene encoding tRNA for 
lysine. An abnormal tRNA causes a deﬁciency in the 
synthesis of proteins required for electron transport 
and ATP production.  

 Three maternally inherited mitochondrial diseases 

affect males more severely than females: 

1. About 85% of individuals affected by Leber’s 
hereditary  optic  neuropathy  (LHON)  are  male.  
The disease is conﬁned to the eye. Individuals suf-
fer a sudden loss of vision in the second and third 
decades of life.   

2. Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome (anemia 
and mitochondrial myopathy observed in childhood). 
3. Male infertility. Almost all the energy for sperm 

motility derives from mitochondria.
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes,  organelles  present  in  all  mammalian 

cells except erythrocytes, contain at least one oxidase 
and  one  catalase  for  the  (cid:96)-oxidation  of  very  long 
chain fatty acids (VLCFA) as well as to the (cid:95)-oxida-
tion of branched-chain fatty acids. In addition, several 
of  the  peroxisomal  pathways  are  conducive  to  the 
production of hydrogen peroxide, and its subsequent 
breakdown by catalase. 

Peroxisomes  are  bound  by  single  membranes 
enclosing a dense matrix containing metabolic en-
zymes, substrates and cofactors forming crystalloid 
cores (Figure 2-26). The peroxisomal membrane is a 
lipid bilayer with embedded peroxisomal membrane 
proteins synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol 
and then imported into peroxisomes. 

Peroxisome biogenesis can take place through two 

pathways:

1. De novo generation pathway: Peroxisomes can 
be  formed  from  pre-peroxisomal  vesicles  budding 
off from the endoplasmic reticulum and fusing with 
each other to form mature peroxisomes. 

2. Fission generation pathway: Pre-existing per-
oxisomes can generate new peroxisomes by growth

and ﬁssion (mediated by PEX11, dynamin-related 
proteins and a ﬁssion protein), using new proteins 
and  lipids  derived  from  vesicles  originated  in  the 
endoplasmic reticulum.

  Peroxisomes contain different peroxisomal pro-
teins, including peroxins (PEX), involved in peroxi-
somal biogenesis. PEX are receptor proteins shuttling 
between the cytosol and the peroxisome after binding 
to  the  peroxisome  targeting  signal  (PTS)  of  the 
protein to be imported. PEX uncouple from the PTS 
before the protein is imported (see Figure 2-26). PEX 
are encoded by PEX genes, some of them associated 
with peroxisome biogenesis disorders. To date, 15 
human PEX genes have been identiﬁed.

Peroxisome biogenesis involves the targeting and 
import into pre-existing peroxisomes of matrix pro-
teins and peroxisomal membrane proteins. 

Matrix proteins are targeted to peroxisomes from 
the cytosol by the PTS recognized in the cytosol by 
the  shuttling  receptor  PEX5.   The  import  process  
consists of three consecutive steps (see Figure 2-26):
1. PEX5 interacts with PEX14 at the peroxisomal 

membrane forming a transport pore or channel.

2. Matrix proteins dock and translocate inside the 

peroxisome across the transport pore.

3. The  importing  pore  disassembles  and  PEX5 
recycles back to the cytosol for another import round. 
Peroxisomal membrane proteins are targeted to 
peroxisomal  membranes  through  the  interaction 
of  the  PTS  with  the  shuttling  receptor  PEX19  in 
the  cytosol  and  then  the  docking  of  this  complex 
to  PEX16  bound  to  the  peroxisomal  membrane. 
Peroxisomal membrane proteins can also be targeted 
to peroxisomes by insertion into the membrane of 
the  sendoplasmic  reticulum  followed  by  vesicular 
transport to peroxisomes. 

Catalase  (peroxidase),  a  major  peroxisome  en-
zyme, decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water or 
is utilized to oxidize other organic compounds (uric 
acid, amino acids, and fatty acids). Peroxisomes, like 
mitochondria, degrade fatty acids. The oxidation of 
fatty acids by mitochondria and peroxisomes provides 
metabolic energy.

Peroxisomes  participate  in  the  biosynthesis  of 
lipids.  Cholesterol  and  dolichol  are  synthesized  in 
both peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. In the 
human liver, peroxisomes are involved in the synthesis 
of bile acids (derived from cholesterol). 

Peroxisomes contain enzymes involved in the syn-
thesis of plasmalogens, phospholipids in which one 
of the hydrocarbon chains is linked to glycerol by an 
ether bond (instead of an ester bond). Plasmalogens 
contribute  more  than  80%  of  the  phospholipid 

content of myelin in brain and are involved in the 
protection of cells from ROS reduced damage. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Peroxisomal disorders  
The signiﬁcant role that peroxisomes play in human 
metabolism is highlighted by devastating disorders 
attributed  to  defects  in  peroxisome  biogenesis  and 
function.

There are two types of peroxisomal disorders: 
1. Single peroxisomal enzyme deﬁciencies, caused 
by mutations of genes encoding peroxisomal enzymes.
2.  Peroxisomal  biogenesis  disorders  (PBDs), 
determined  by  mutations  of  PEX  genes,  involved 
in peroxisome biogenesis and function. Most PBDs 
consist of severe neurologic dysfunction due to central 
nervous system malformations, myelin abnormalities, 
and neuronal degeneration.

PBDs  include  four  diseases:  infantile  Refsum 
disease  (IRD),  neonatal  adrenoleukodystrophy 
(NALD),  rhizomelic  chondrodysplasia,  and  the 
cerebrohepatorenal Zellweger syndrome (ZS). 

All peroxisomal disorders, except X-linked NALD, 
are autosomal recessive. A defect in the transport of 
VLCFA  across  the  peroxisomal  membrane  is  the 
cause  of  NALD.  Accumulation  of  VLCFA  in  the 
adrenal cortex causes adrenal atrophy. Incorporation 
of VLCFA in myelin disrupts its structure.

IRD, NALD and ZS are caused by mutations of 
PEX genes. Therefore, they share  a common patho-
genic feature: deﬁcient peroxisomal assembly.

ZS (see Figure 2-26) is the most severe within the 
group of  PBDs. It is fatal within the ﬁrst year of life.  
The  primary  defect  is  the  mutation  of  the  PEX1, 
PEX2, PEX3, PEX5, PEX6 AND PEX12  genes encod-
ing proteins necessary for the import of membrane 
and matrix proteins. 

The clinical characteristics of ZS include:
1.  Dysmorphic  facial  features  (prominent  fore-
head, broad nasal bridge, large fontanelles and ﬂat 
supraorbital ridges).

2. Hepatomegalia (enlargement of the liver; hepatic 
ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis). Hepatocellular peroxisomes are 
absent or severely decreased.

3. Neurologic abnormalities (defective neuronal 
migration).  Affected  children  may  show  at  birth 
muscle  hypotonicity,  an  inability  to  move,  and  a 
failure to suck or swallow. 

We have seen than peroxisomes are the sites for 
oxidation of VLCFA. So increased level of this mol-
ecule in blood plasma is an indication of ZS. Prenatal 
analysis for VLCFA and plasmalogen are used from 
amniotic  tests  and  absence  of  peroxisomes  in  liver 
biopsy is another indicator of ZS.

Epithelial Glands

• There are two types of glands: 
  (1) Exocrine glands, that secrete their prod-
ucts through ducts onto an internal or external 
space.
  (2) Endocrine glands, that lack ducts and 
secrete their products into the blood.

• There are different types of exocrine glands:
  (1) Unicellular  (a single cell, for example, 
the goblet cell of the intestinal or respiratory 
epithelium).
  (2) Multicellular glands. Multicellular glands 
form the parenchyma of organs such as the 
pancreas and the prostate.

• Exocrine glands have two structural compo-
nents: 
  (1) The secretory units, whose cells synthe-
size and secrete a product called secretion.
  (2) The excretory ducts, that transport the 
secretion to an epithelial surface. 

• Glands with a single unbranched duct are 
called simple glands. Larger glands have a 
branched duct system and are called branched 
or compound glands. Branched glands are sur-
rounded by a connective tissue capsule that 

sends partitions or septa (together with blood 
vessels and nerve ﬁbers) into the mass of the 
gland, which becomes partitioned into lobes. 
  Thinner septa divide lobes into smaller units 
called lobules. Duct branches are present in 
the interlobar, interlobular, and intralobular 
connective tissue septa as interlobar ducts, in-
terlobular ducts, and intercalated/striated ducts 
connected to the secretory units (acini).

• A simple gland can be straight, coiled, or 
branched (the term “branched” refers to the 
secretory unit, but not to the excretory duct). 
The gland is called simple tubular, simple 
coiled, or simple branched tubular. 
  A gland with a secretory unit with a rounded 
form is called simple acinar or alveolar gland. 
The secretory unit can be tubular and the 
gland is called simple tubular.  

• In a branched acinar gland, the acini are lined 
by secretory cells surrounding a narrow lumen. 
The acini and alveoli of the salivary glands and 
the mammary glands contain contractile bas-
ket-like  myoepithelial cells. The acinar cellular 
organization can be part of the wall of short 
tubular ducts and also form their endings. The 

gland is then called branched tubuloacinar 
gland (for example, mammary gland). 

• Glands can secrete:
  (1) Mucus (mucous glands).
  (2) Proteins (serous glands).
  (3) A combination of mucus and proteins 
(mixed glands). Mixed glands contain both 
mucous and serous cells, the latter forming 
a crescentic or half-moon–shaped region 
(serous demilunes) capping the acini. 

• When a gland releases its product by exocy-
tosis, it is called merocrine gland (such as the 
pancreas). A gland in which the apical region 
of a cell is pinched off and released into the 
lumen is called apocrine gland (an example 
is the mammary gland). When the whole cell 
is released and is part of the secretion, the 
gland is called holocrine gland (such as the 
sebaceous glands of the skin). 

Cytomembranes and the plasma mem-
brane. Intracellular membranes, called 
cytomembranes, separate diverse cellular 
processes into compartments. Cytomem-
branes are components of the endoplasmic

reticulum and Golgi apparatus.  The nucleus, 
mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes 
are bound by cytomembranes and are called 
organelles. The nucleus and mitochondria 
are surrounded by a double membrane; lyso-
somes and peroxisomes are surrounded by a 
single membrane. Lipids and glycogen are not 
membrane-bound and are called inclusions. 

• The plasma membrane is the structural and 
functional boundary of a cell. It separates the 
intracellular environment from the extracellular 
space. 
   The plasma membrane consists of lipids and 
proteins. Phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, 
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine 
and sphingomyelin) form a bilayer consisting 
of outer and inner leaﬂets. Phosphatidylinositol 
is another phospholipid, with an important 
role in cell signaling,  localized to the inner 
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane. Cholesterol 
is inserted into the phospholipid bilayer and 
modulates membrane ﬂuidity. 
   Integral membrane proteins are trans-
membrane proteins spanning the lipid 
bilayer through (cid:95)-helical regions. Peripheral 
membrane proteins are indirectly linked to 
the plasma membrane by protein-protein 
interactions. Peripheral membrane proteins 
exposed to the cytosol interact with cytoskel-
etal components. The extracellular portion of 
integral and peripheral membrane proteins is 
generally glycosylated. A glycocalyx coats the 
surface of most epithelial cells.

• Freeze-fracture combined with electron 
microscopy enables the visualization of intra-
membranous proteins. A frozen and fractured 
specimen is used to produce a thin metal 
replica of the two surfaces of a membrane 
and its  two artiﬁcial faces.
   The lipid bilayer membranes are frozen at 
liquid nitrogen temperature (–196oC) and 
“split” along the middle of the hydrophobic 
core. As a result, two complementary halves of 
a membrane are produced and the hydropho-
bic face exposed.
  Each half or monolayer of the membrane has 
a surface and a face. The original monolayer 
facing the extracellular environment exhibits a 
surface designated extracellular surface (ES); 
the corresponding area facing the hydrophobic 
core of the membrane becomes the extracel-
lular face (EF) and was created artiﬁcially 
after “splitting” the membrane.  The original 
monolayer facing the intracellular or proto-
plasmic environment has a surface called  the 
protoplasmic surface (PS); the corresponding 
area facing the hydrophobic core is the proto-
plasmic face (PF).
   Membrane proteins tend to remain associ-
ated to the cytoplasmic or protoplasmic leaﬂet 
and appear as particles on the P fracture face 
(PF). Pits complementary to the particles and 
representing the space once occupied by the 
protein, are present on the E fracture face 
(EF).

• Transporters include carrier proteins and 
channel proteins. They mediate the selective 

passage of molecules across the cell mem-
brane. Gases (such as oxygen and carbon 
dioxide) can cross membranes by passive 
diffusion. Glucose, electrically charged 
molecules, and small ions require transport 
proteins and channel proteins for facilitated 
diffusion across a membrane.
   Channel proteins can be ligand-gated 
channels (gates which open upon ligand 
binding) or voltage-gated channels (which 
open in response to changes in electrical 
potential across the membrane). 

• Cytomembranes, represented in part by the 
endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, 
establish a continuum between intracellular 
compartments and the extracellular space. 
The lumen of cisternae, tubules, and vesicles 
is continuous with the extracellular space. 
The membranous wall separates the luminal 
compartment from the cytosolic compart-
ment. Products released into the lumen of 
the endoplasmic reticulum are transported 
to the Golgi apparatus by transporting 
vesicles and eventually to the cell exterior by 
exocytosis. 
   Imagine that there is a continuum in 
this secretory sequence and that all the 
luminal spaces are virtually interconnected 
and continuous with the cell exterior. The 
freeze-fracture technique takes advantage of 
this virtual arrangement if you consider that 
the membrane splitting knife can jump from 
the exocytoplasmic leaﬂet of a membrane-
bound vesicle to the exocytoplasmic leaﬂet 
of the plasma membrane exposed to the 
environment. 

• The cytomembranes of the endoplasmic 
reticulum can be associated with ribosomes 
(rough endoplasmic reticulum) or lack ribo-
somes (smooth endoplasmic reticulum). The 
rough endoplasmic reticulum participates in 
protein synthesis and transport to the Golgi 
apparatus. 
   The smooth endoplasmic reticulum has a 
signiﬁcant role in cell detoxiﬁcation reactions 
required for converting harmful lipid-soluble 
substances into water-insoluble material.   
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is gener-
ally adjacent to glycogen deposits and lipid 
droplets (nonmembrane-bound inclusions).
 
   Proteins targeted to the nucleus, mito-
chondria, or peroxisomes and cytoskeletal 
proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes 
(polyribosomes) and released in the cytosol.

• The Golgi apparatus is involved in the 
attachment of oligosaccharides to proteins 
and lipids involving glycosyltransferases. It 
consists of four compartments: 
  (1) A cis-Golgi, the receiving site from the 
endoplasmic reticulum.
  (2) A medial-Golgi, interposed between the 
cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi.
  (3) A trans-Golgi, the exit site.
  (4) A trans-Golgi network (TGN), a sorting 
site. 
  Golgins, a family of coiled-coil proteins, 

stabilize the ﬂattened stacks of sacs of the Golgi 
apparatus.
Clathrin-coated vesicles are observed during 
lysosomal sorting and endocytosis.  COP- (for 
coat proteins) coated vesicles are seen trafﬁck-
ing between Golgi stacks (COPI) and from the 
endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (COPII). 
 Golgi-derived products can be released from 
the cell by exocytosis or sorted to lysosomes.   
Exocytosis can be continuous and does not 
require a triggering signal. This form of secre-
tion is called constitutive secretion.  
 Certain classes of Golgi-derived cargos are 
stored into secretory granules and released 
by exocytosis under control of a chemical or 
electrical signal. This mechanism  is called 
facultative or regulated secretion. 
  The sorting mechanism of lysosomes involves 
two steps: 
  (1) The insertion of mannose-6-phosphate 
(M6P) into glycoproteins destined to lyso-
somes.
  (2) The presence of the transmembrane 
M6P receptor protein in the membrane of the 
transporting vesicle. This mechanism separates 
M6P-containing lysosomal enzymes from other 
glycoproteins.

• Lysosomes are organelles surrounded by a 
single membrane. Two types of lysosomes are 
recognized: 
  (1) Primary lysosomes (inactive), the primary 
storage of lysosomal enzymes.
  (2) Secondary lysosomes (autolysosomes), 
engaged in a catalytic process. 
   Lysosomes target internalized extracellular 
material for degradation through the activity of 
lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes operating at an 
acidic pH (5.0). 
   There are three major pathways involved in 
intracellular degradation of materials: 
  (1) Phagocytosis (the pagocytosed material 
is enclosed within a phagosome that fuses with 
a lysosome to form a phagolysosome).
  (2) Endocytosis (the endocytosed material is 
delivered to an early endosome and then to a 
late endosome that fuses with a lysosome). 
  (3) Macroautophagy (the endoplasmic 
reticulum encloses an aged cell component to 
form an autophagosome that fuses with a lyso-
some to form an autolysosome).

   Speciﬁc cells have secretory lysosomes 
(hydrolytic enzymes are secreted). Examples 
include:
  (1) The osteoclast, involved in bone resorp-
tion.
  (2) Cytolytic T cells and natural killer cells, 
engaged in the destruction of target cells.
  (3) Melanocytes, releasing melanin derived 
from melanosomes (lysosome-related organ-
elles) to produce skin and hair pigmentation.  

   Lysosomal storage disorders occur when 
hereditary deﬁciency in lysosomal enzymes 
prevents the normal breakdown of cell compo-
nents that accumulate progressively in cells.. Ex-
amples are Tay-Sachs disease (accumulation 
of ganglioside GM2 in the brain), Gaucher’s 
disease (accumulation of glucocerebrosides

in the spleen and central nervous system), 
and Niemann-Pick disease (accumulation 
of sphingomyelin in the spleen and central 
nervous system). 
 
   Internalization of material occurs by the 
process of endocytosis. The reverse process 
is called exocytosis. Endocytosis involves the 
internalization of virus or bacteria by phagocy-
tosis using clathrin-independent vesicles and 
the uptake of small macromolecules utilizing 
clathin-coated vesicles.
   Receptor-mediated endocytosis of a ligand 
requires a plasma membrane receptor. The 
ligand-receptor complex is internalized by the 
process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
  This process involves: 
  (1) The formation of a clathrin-coated pit (to 
concentrate ligand-receptor complexes in a 
small surface area).
  (2) The invagination of the coated pit to 
form a coated vesicle.
  (3) The pinching off of the coated vesicle 
from the plasma membrane.
  (4) Transport of the vesicle to an endosome.
  (5) Removal of the clathrin coat before fu-
sion of the vesicle with the endosome.
  (6) Recycling back of the receptor-containing 
vesicle to the plasma membrane. 
   This transport mechanism is defective in 
familial hypercholesterolemia because of a 
mutation in the gene encoding the receptor 
for the ligand low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
  High levels of cholesterol in blood plasma 
result in the formation of atheromas in the 
intima of blood vessels.

• The fusion of a vesicle to a target membrane 
requires: 
  (1) Recognition of a speciﬁc target mem-
brane site.
  (2) Vesicle-membrane fusion. 
  Vesicle-membrane fusion is mediated by two 
interacting cytosolic proteins: 
  (1) NSF (for N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive 
fusion.

  (2) SNAP (for soluble NSF attachment 
protein). 
  NSF and SNAP bind to speciﬁc membrane 
receptors called SNARE (for SNAP receptors). 
  SNARE ligands on the membrane of the 
transporting vesicle (vesicle-SNARE, v-SNARE) 
and the target membrane receptor (target-
SNARE, t-SNARE) are responsible for docking 
the vesicle to the target membrane. Follow-
ing docking, NSF and SNAP are recruited to 
produce fusion.  

• Mitochondria are organelles surrounded by 
a double membrane. The outer mitochondrial 
membrane is separated by an intermembrane 
space from the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane. The inner membrane folds into cristae 
extending into the mitochondrial matrix.
  The inner mitochondrial membrane harbors 
the electron-transport chain and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) synthase. 
  The mitochondrial matrix contains most of 
the enzymes of the citric acid cycle. Mitochon-
dria participate in apoptosis (programmed cell 
death), steroidogenesis, and thermogenesis in 
brown fat.
   Mitochondria are transmitted by the mother 
(maternal inheritance). Males do not transmit 
mitochondria at fertilization. Both males and 
females can be affected by mitochondrial 
disease, but males never transmit the disorder. 
   Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red ﬁbers 
(MERRF) manifests with muscle weakness, 
loss of coordination (ataxia), and multiple 
sizures. MERRF is caused by a mutation in a 
mitochondrial DNA gene encoding lysine tRNA.
  Maternally inherited mitochondrial diseases 
affecting males more severely than females 
are Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy 
(LHON), Pearson marrow-pancreas syn-
drome, and male infertility.  

• Peroxisomes are organelles surrounded by 
a single membrane. Peroxisomes contain crys-
taloid cores containing oxidases and catalases, 
enzymes that oxidize organic compounds and 

decompose hydrogen peroxide into water. 
Peroxisomes are involved in the synthesis of 
bile acids and biosynthesis of lipids.
   Peroxisome biogenesis involve two path-
ways: 
  (1) De novo generation pathway,  consisting 
in pre-peroxisomal vesicles budding off from 
the endoplasmic reticulum and fusing to form 
mature peroxisomes.
  (2) The ﬁssion generation pathway, derived 
from the ﬁssion and growth of a pre-existing 
peroxisome.
   Peroxisomes contain peroxins, receptor 
proteins shuttling between the cytosol and the 
peroxisome, matrix proteins, and peroxisomal 
membrane proteins. 
  How do peroxins work? Peroxins bind to 
the peroxisome targeting signal of the matrix 
proteins to be imported across transporting 
pores or channels. 
  In fact, peroxisomal membrane proteins 
build the pores serving as transporting gates 
for proteins that need to gain access inside 
the peroxisome. 
  Thus, mutations in the peroxin encoding 
genes (about 15 genes in human) determine 
peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs). 
  There are two types of PBDs: 
  (1) Single peroxisomal enzyme deﬁciencies.
  (2) PBDs caused by mutations of peroxin 
genes. 
   Neurologic dysfunction–caused by mal-
formations of the central nervous system, 
myelinization abnormalities and neuronal 
defective migration–characterize PBDs.

  Zellweger syndrome, a severe and fatal 
cerebrohepatorenal disorder,  is determined 
by the failure of peroxisomal enzymes to be 
imported from the cytosol into the peroxi-
some. Deﬁcient peroxisomal assembly in 
hepatocytes is associated with ﬁbrosis and 
cirrhosis. 
  Additional PBDs include infantile Refsum 
disease, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and 
rhizomelic chondrodysplasia.

3. Cell Signaling

Cells respond to extracellular signals produced by other cells or by themselves. This mechanism, called cell signal-
ing, allows cell-cell communication and is necessary for the functional regulation and integration of multicellular 
organisms.  Our discussion in this chapter not only provides the basis for understanding cell signaling pathways 
but serves also as an introduction to General Pathology, including aging, cell senescence and neoplasia and 
the role of cell injury in human disease, including necrosis, apoptosis and necroptosis and the mechanisms of 
autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis and mitophagy.

Signaling  molecules  can  transmit  information  by 
acting as ligands binding to receptors expressed by 
their target cells. Some signaling molecules can act on 
the cell surface after binding to cell surface receptors; 
others can cross the plasma membrane and bind to 
intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm and nucleus.  
An understanding of the molecular aspects of cell 
signaling is clinically relevant to uncover potential 
targets  of  novel  therapeutics  for  the  treatment  of 
metabolic dysfunctions and diseases. 

Types of cell signaling and feedback action
Signaling molecules use different routes to reach their 
targets (Figure 3-1):  

1.  Endocrine  cell  signaling  involves  a  signaling 
molecule,  a  hormone,  secreted  by  an  endocrine 
cell  and transported through the circulation to act 
on  distant  target  cells.  An  example  is  the  steroid 
hormone  testosterone  produced  in  the  testes,  that 
stimulates the development and maintenance of the 
male  reproductive  tract  using  the  vascular  route. 
Neuroendocrine cell signaling is a speciﬁc form of 
endocrine  signaling  involving  a  product  secreted 
by a nerve cell into the bloodstream and acting on 
distant cells.

2. Paracrine cell signaling is mediated by a mol-
ecule  acting  locally  to  regulate  the  behavior  of  a 
nearby cell. A paracrine molecule diffuses over small 
distances to reach a target cell.

Neurotransmitter  or  synaptic  cell  signaling  is 
a specialized form of paracrine signaling. Neurons 
secrete neurotransmitters that diffuse short distances 
and bind to receptors on target cells.

Juxtacrine cell signaling is contact-dependent sig-
naling. It requires the contact of proteins of adjacent 
plasma membranes for signaling to occur. An example 
is the immunologic synapse, a combination of cell-
cell adhesion and signaling that takes place when the 
plasma membranes of an antigen-presenting cells and 
a T cell are in contact with each other. 

3.  Autocrine  cell  signaling  is  deﬁned  by  cells 
responding to signaling molecules that they them-
selves produce. A classic example is the response of 

cells  of  the  immune  system  to  foreign  antigens  or 
growth factors that trigger their own proliferation and 
differentiation. Abnormal autocrine signaling  leads 
to the unregulated growth of cancer cells.

Cell signaling mechanisms require a feedback ac-
tion. In general, after a signaling molecule binds to 
its receptor, the target cells exerts either a negative or 
positive feedback action to regulate the release of the 
targeting hormone (Figure 3-2).

Hormones and ligands 
Binding of a hormone or ligand to its receptor initi-
ates a cascade of intracellular reactions (called signal 
transduction) to regulate critical functions such as 
embryonic  and  fetal  development,  cell  prolifera-
tion  and  differentiation,  movement,  metabolism, 
and behavior.

Ligands include:
1. Steroid hormones. 
2. Peptide hormones, neuropeptides and growth 

factors. 

3. Nitric oxide. 
4. Neurotransmitters. 
5. Eicosanoids.

Steroid hormones
Steroid hormones (Box 3-A) are lipid-soluble mol-
ecules that diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer of 
the plasma membrane of target cells, bind to intra-
cellular receptors in the cytoplasm, enter the nucleus 
as  steroid  hormone-receptor  complexes  and  bind 
to speciﬁc receptor sites  on chromatin (speciﬁcally 
hormone-response elements at the DNA) to activate 
or repress gene expression (Figure 3-3). Steroid recep-
tors are members of the steroid receptor superfamily.
Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol 
and include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone  and 
corticosteroids. Steroid hormones are usually secreted 
as  they  are  synthesized  and  are  transported  in  the 
bloodstream bound to protein carriers.

 Testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone are sex 
steroids and are produced predominantly by the go-
nads. In the androgen insensitivity syndrome (also

                     Endocrine signaling

Endocrine cells secrete a polypeptide or steroid 
hormone into a blood vessel. The hormone is then 
carried to a target cell, which may be located at a 
considerable distance from the secreting cell.
   An example of a polypeptide hormone is 
thyrotrophic hormone, secreted by the hypophysis 
and acting on the thyroid gland. An example of a 
steroid hormone is estradiol, produced by the 
ovaries and acting on the endometrium.

              Neuroendocrine signaling

In response to a neural signal, neuroendocrine 
cells secrete a hormone into the blood to travel to 
a target organ.  An example is norepinephrine 
acting on hepatocytes or adipocytes.

In an immunologic synapse, an antigen-presenting

ligand secreted by one cell binds to the receptor of 
the other cell to trigger a response.

• They derive from cholesterol.
• They bind mainly to intracellular receptors in the cytosol and nucleus.
• They circulate in blood bound to a protein.
• They are nonpolar molecules.
• Steroid hormones are not stored in the producing endocrine cell. 
• Steroid hormones can be administered orally and are readily absorbed in the 
gastrointestinal tract.

Various feedback loops 
coordinate the secretion of 
hormones. For example, a 
negative feedback loop 
prevents the unregulated release 
of a hormone from the 
hypophysis into the blood 
circulation when the target cell or 
tissue may be nonresponsive.
  A positive feedback loop 
occurs when the hypophysis 
senses a decrease in the blood 
levels of a hormone produced by 
the target cell or tissue.

There are types of cell signaling molecules  structur-
ally and functionally distinct from steroids but act 
on target cells by binding to intracellular receptors 
after entering the cell by diffusion across the plasma

to regulate development, wound healing and epider-
mal differentiation; see Chapter 11, Integumentary 
System). The synthetic pathway of thyroid hormones 
and some of their actions are presented in Chapter 
19, Endocrine System.

Peptide hormones and growth factors
A  large  variety  of  signaling  molecules  bind  to  cell 
surface receptors. Unlike intracellular steroid recep-
tors, membrane bound receptors of peptide/protein 
ligands affect cellular function by transduction signal-
ing. Several groups are recognized:

1. Peptide hormones (see Box 3-B): This group 
includes  insulin,  glucagon  and  hormones  secreted 
by the hypophysis and peptides secreted by neurons 
(enkephalins  and  endorphins),  that  decrease  pain 
responses in the central nervous system. See Chapter 
18,  Neuroendocrine  System,  and  Chapter  19,  En-
docrine System, for a  detailed  discussion of peptide 
hormones and neuropeptides.

2. Growth factors: This group of peptides controls 
cell growth and differentiation (nerve growth factor, 
NGF;  epidermal  growth  factor,  EGF;  platelet-
derived growth factor, PDGF). 

NGF is a member of a family of peptides called 
neurotrophins,  which regulate the development and 
viability of neurons. EGF stimulates cell proliferation 
and is essential during embryonic development and 
in the adult. PDGF  is stored in blood platelets and 
released during clotting.

Nitric oxide
Nitric  oxide  is  a  simple  gas  synthesized  from  the 
amino  acid  arginine  by  the  enzyme  nitric  oxide 
synthase.  It acts as  a paracrine signaling molecule in 
the nervous, immune, and circulatory systems. Like 
steroid hormones,  nitric oxide can diffuse across the 
plasma membrane of its target cells. Unlike steroids, 
nitric oxide does not bind to an intracellular recep-
tor to regulate transcription. Instead, it regulates the 
activity of intracellular target enzymes. 

The following are relevant characteristics of nitric 

oxide: 

1. It is an unstable molecule with a limited half-life 

(seconds). 

2. It has local effects. 
3. A well-deﬁned function of nitric oxide signal-
ing  is  the  dilation  of  blood  vessels.  For  example, 
the  release  of  the  neurotransmitter  acetylcholine 
from nerve cell endings in the blood vessel muscle 
cell wall stimulates the release of nitric oxide from 
endothelial cells. 

Nitric  oxide  increases  the  activity  of  the  second

 Box 3-B  |  Peptide hormones

• They are synthesized as precursor molecules (prohormones).
• They are stored in membrane-bound secretory vesicles.
• They are generally water soluble (polar).
• They circulate in blood as unbound molecules.
• Peptide hormones cannot be administered orally.
• They usually bind to cell surface receptors.

messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
in smooth muscle cells, which then causes cell muscle 
relaxation and blood vessel dilation (see Chapter 21, 
Sperm Transport and Maturation). 

Nitroglycerin, a pharmacologic agent used  in the 
treatment of heart disease, is converted to nitric oxide, 
which increases heart blood ﬂow by  dilation of the 
coronary blood vessels.

Neurotransmitters
These cell signaling molecules are released by neurons 
and act on cell surface receptors present in neurons 
or other type of target cells (such as muscle cells). 

This  group  includes  acetylcholine,  dopamine, 
epinephrine  (adrenaline),  serotonin,  histamine, 
glutamate, and (cid:97)-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  The 
release of neurotransmitters from neurons is triggered 
by an action potential. Released neurotransmitters 
diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to surface 
receptors on the target cells.

There are differences  that distinguish the mecha-
nism of action of neurotransmitters.  For example, 
acetylcholine  is  a  ligand-gated  ion  channel.  It 
induces a change in  conformation of ion channels 
to control  ion ﬂow across the plasma membrane in 
target cells. 

Neurotransmitter  receptors    can  be  associated 
to G proteins (see below), a class of signaling mol-
ecules linking cell surface receptors to intracellular 
responses. 

Some  neurotransmitters  have  a  dual  function. 
For example, epinephrine (noradrenaline; produced 
in  the  medulla  of  the  adrenal  gland)  can  act  as  a 
neurotransmitter  and  as  a  hormone  to  induce  the 
breakdown of glycogen in muscle cells.

Eicosanoids
Eicosanoids are lipid-containing inﬂammatory me-
diators produced in leukocytes and other cells of the 

 Box 3-C  |  Eicosanoids

• They derive from polyunsaturated fatty acids with 18, 20, and 22 carbons.
• Arachidonic acid is the main precursor.
• This group includes prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and 
prostacyclin.
• They have primary autocrine and paracrine actions.
• The synthesis of eicosanoids is regulated by hormones.
• They usually bind to cell surface receptors.

Cell surface receptors

immune system that, in contrast to steroids, bind to 
cell surface receptors (Box 3-C). 

Prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxanes, and 
leukotrienes are members of this group of molecules. 
They stimulate blood platelet aggregation, inﬂam-
matory responses, and smooth muscle contraction.
Leukotrienes  (Greek  leukos,  white;  Chemistry 
triene, a compound containing three double bonds) 
are synthesized by the oxidation of arachidonic acid 
by the enzyme arachidonate lipoxygenase. 

During the synthesis of prostaglandins, arachidonic 
acid is converted  to prostaglandin H2 by the enzyme 
prostaglandin synthase. This enzyme is inhibited by 
aspirin  and  anti-inﬂammatory  drugs.  Inhibition 
of prostaglandin synthase by aspirin reduces pain, 
inﬂammation, platelet aggregation, and blood clot-
ting (prevention of strokes).

Cell surface receptors
Most ligands responsible for cell signaling and signal-
ing transduction bind to receptors on the surface of 
target cells. 

Ligand binding to hormone  and growth factor 
receptors  activates  a  series  of  intracellular  targets 
located downstream of the receptor, in particular 
the  activity  of  intracellular  proteins,  or,  like  neu-
rotransmitter receptors, controlling the ﬂow of water 
(aquaporins) and electrolytes across ligand-gated ion 
channels located on the plasma membrane.  

Several functional aspects of speciﬁc cell surface 

receptors are relevant:

1. G protein–coupled receptors. 
2. Receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases.
3. Cytokine receptors.
4. Tyrosine  phosphatases  and  serine–threonine 

kinases. 

G protein–coupled receptors  
Members of a large family of G proteins (more than 
1000  guanine  nucleotide–binding  proteins)  are 
present at the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane 
(Figure 3-4). 

When  a  signaling  molecule  or  receptor  ligand 
binds  to  the  extracellular  portion  of  a  cell  surface 
receptor, its cytosolic domain undergoes a confor-
mational change that enables binding of the receptor 
to the G protein complex. This contact activates G 
protein, which then dissociates from the receptor and 
triggers an intracellular signal to an enzyme or ion 
channel. We return to G protein when we discuss the 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway.

Receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases 
There are two main classes of tyrosine kinases: 

1. Receptor tyrosine kinases are transmembrane 
proteins with a ligand-binding extracellular domain 
and an intracellular kinase domain (Figure 3-5).

                                              G protein

       G protein consists of three subunits ((cid:95), (cid:96), and (cid:97)). The (cid:95) subunit 
1
regulates G protein activity. 
  In the resting state, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is bound to the (cid:95) subunit 
in a complex with (cid:96) and (cid:97) subunits.
       G protein transmits a cell surface signal to an adjacent target molecule 
2
(adenylyl cyclase or ion channel).
       Hormone binding stimulates the release of GDP and its exchange for 
3
guanosine triphosphate (GTP).  
   The activated GTP-bound (cid:95) subunit dissociates from (cid:96) and (cid:97) and interacts 
with a target to induce a response.

2.  Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are located in 
the  cytosol,  nucleus  and  inner  side  of  the  plasma 
membrane.

Receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (see  Figure  3-5),  in 
contrast  with  G  protein–coupled  receptors,    are  
enzymes  that  phosphorylate  substrate  proteins  on 
tyrosine  residues.  EGF,  NGF,  PDGF,  insulin  and 
several growth factors are receptor tyrosine kinases. 
Most  of  the  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  consist  of  
single  polypeptides,  although  the  insulin  receptor 

and other growth factors consist of a pair of poly-
peptide chains.

Binding of a ligand (such as a growth factor) to 
the extracellular domain of these receptors induces 
receptor dimerization that results in receptor auto-
phosphorylation (the two polypeptide chains phos-
phorylate one another). The autophosphorylation of 
the receptors determines the binding of downstream 
signaling molecules to the tyrosine kinase domain.

Downstream  signaling  molecules  bind  to  phos-
photyrosine residues through  SH2 domains (for Src 
homology 2). Src (for sarcoma) is a gene present in 
the tumor-producing Rous sarcoma virus and encodes 
a protein that functions as a tyrosine kinase.

  The  subfamily  of  nonreceptor  tyrosine  kinases 
includes the Src family, the Fujinami poultry sar-
coma/feline  sarcoma  (Fps/Fes),  and  Fes-related 
(Fer) subfamily.

How do receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases 
differ functionally from each other? In the absence of a 
ligand, receptor tyrosine kinases are unphosphorylated 
and monomeric, whereas nonreceptor tyrosine kinase 
is maintained in an inactive state by cellular inhibi-
tor proteins. Activation occurs when the inhibitors 
are dissociated or by recruitment to transmembrane 
receptors that trigger autophosphorylation. Tyrosine 
kinase activity terminates when tyrosine phosphatases 
hydrolyze  tyrosyl  phosphates  and  by  induction  of 
inhibitory molecules. 

The activity of tyrosine kinases in cancer cells can 
be affected by unregulated autophosphorylation in the 
absence of a ligand, by disrupting autoregulation of 
the tyrosine kinase, or by overexpression of receptor 
tyrosine kinase and/or its ligand. Abnormal activation 
of tyrosine kinases can stimulate the proliferation and 
anticancer drug resistance of malignant cells. 

Tyrosine kinase activity can be inhibited by ima-

(chronic  myelomonocytic  leukemia)  and  c-kit 
(systemic  mastocytosis  and  mast  cell  leukemias). 
Imatinib has been successfully used in the treatment 
of gastrointestinal solid tumors.

Cytokine receptors
This family of receptors consists of several subfamilies 
classiﬁed on their differing structure and activities. 
They include:

1. Type I cytokine receptors (to which interleukin 
ligands bind) and type II cytokine receptors (mainly 
for interferon ligands). 

2. Chemokine receptors and chemokine ligands 
(CC, CXC, CX3C and CXCR1; the spacing between 
cysteins (C) determines the bound type of chemokine 
ligand). 

3. Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. 
4. Transforming growth factor-(cid:96) (TGF(cid:96)) recep-

tors.  

All cytokine receptors are associated with one or 
more members of the JAK-STAT pathway. Cytokines 
and cytokine receptors regulate hematopoiesis, im-
mune  responses,  inﬂammation  and  tissue  healing 
through the JAK-STAT pathway that, consequently, 
represents a potential therapeutic target. We discuss 
below details of the JAK-STAT pathway (see Figure 
3-9). 

Note that tyrosine kinases are not intrinsic com-
ponents of the cytokine receptors but instead they 
are  noncovalently  linked.  Upon  ligand  binding  to 
the  cytokine  receptor,  the  activity  of  intracellular 
tyrosine  kinases  is  stimulated.  A  ligand  induces 
the dimerization and cross-phosphorylation of the 
associated  JAK  tyrosine  kinases.  Activated  kinases 
phosphorylate  tyrosine  residues  on  the  receptors, 
providing  binding  sites  for  downstream  signaling 
molecules that contain the SH2 domain. 

Hyperactivation mutations of the type I cytokine 
receptor signaling pathway are associated with myelo-
proliferative diseases and other hematologic defects. 
Abnormal activation of type I cytokine receptor cor-
relates with leukemias and lymphomas.  Defective 
type II cytokine receptor signaling are associated with 
immune deﬁciencies and inﬂammatory conditions.
The chemokine receptor  consists of seven trans-
membrane domains with extracellular loops (deter-
mining ligand speciﬁcity)  and  G–coupled proteins 
at the intracellular domain (to enable downstream 
signaling). Chemokine ligands (CC, CXC, CX3C 
and CXCR1) are  8 kd to 14 kd in size. Binding of 

chemokine  ligands  to  chemokine  receptors  induce 
chemotaxis (cell migration during homing) of target 
inflammatory  cells.  Migrating  cells  are  attracted  
to  sites  with  higher  concentrations  of  chemokines 
(concentration gradient). We discuss homing and in-
ﬂammation in Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis.
The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) su-
perfamily (death receptors) belongs to the cytokine 
receptor group.  The receptors and ligands (TNFL) of 
this family participate in signaling pathways for cell 
proliferation,  survival,  and  differentiation. TNFR/
TNFL  participate  in  chronic  inﬂammatory  condi-
tions  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis  (see  Chapter  5, 
Osteogenesis) and inﬂammatory bowel disease (see 
Chapter 16, Lower Digestive Segment). 

TNFR  are  active  as  self-assembling  noncovalent 
trimers. The  cytoplasmic  domain  of TNFR  is  the 
docking  site  of    signaling  molecules,  such  as  the 
cytoplasmic adaptor protein TRAF (TNF receptor–
associated factors) and  Dead Domain (DD). From 
a functional perspective, adaptor proteins allow the 
regulatory  ﬂexibility  of  the  dead  receptors.  As  we 
discuss in the Apoptosis section of this chapter (see 
Figure 3-15), the Fas receptor has a DD domain that 
binds  to  the  Fas-associated  DD  (FADD)  protein 
adaptor that ultimately recruits and activates caspase 
8 to cause cell death.

Finally,  RANKL  (for  transmembrane  receptor 
for  activation  of  nuclear  factor  kappa  B  ligand),  a 
member  of  the TNF  superfamily  with  binding  af-
ﬁnity to RANK receptor, has a signiﬁcant tole in the 
development of osteoclasts from monocyte precursors 
(see Chapter 4, Connective Tissue). RANK/RANKL 
signaling regulates the differentiation of mammary 
gland  alveolar  buds  into  tubulo-alveolar  structures 
in preparation for lactation.

Members of the TGF-(cid:96) family are protein kinases 
that  phosphorylate  serine  and  threonine  residues 
(rather  than  tyrosine). TGF-(cid:96)  inhibits  the  prolif-
eration of their target cells. Like tyrosine kinase and 
cytokine receptors, binding of ligand to the TGF-(cid:96) 
receptor  induces  receptor  dimerization  and  the 
cytosolic  serine  or  threonine  kinase  domain  cross-
phosphorylates the polypeptide chains of the receptor.

  

Receptors  linked  to  tyrosine  phosphatases  and 
serine-threonine kinases 
So far, we have seen that receptors with enzymatic 
activity  stimulate  protein  phosphorylation  at  tyro-
sine  residues.  However  other  receptors  have  other 
enzymatic activities.  

Some receptors associate with tyrosine phospha-
tases to remove phosphate groups from phosphoty-
rosine residues. Therefore, they regulate the effect 
of tyrosine kinases by arresting signals initiated by  
tyrosine phosphorylation.

Major signal transduction pathways 
Upon  ligand  binding,  most  cell  surface  receptors 
stimulate  intracellular  target  enzymes  to  transmit 
and  amplify  a  signal.  An  ampliﬁed  signal  can  be 
propagated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression 
in response to an external cell stimulus. 

The major intracellular signaling pathways include:
1. The cAMP pathway.
2. The cGMP pathway. 
3. The phospholipid–Ca2+ pathway. 
4. The Ca2+-calmodulin pathway. 
5. The Ras (for rat sarcoma virus), Raf (for rapidly 
accelerated  ﬁbrosarcoma)  and  MAP  (for  mitogen-
activated protein) kinase pathway. 

6. The JAK-STAT (for Janus kinase–signal trans-

ducers and activators of transcription) pathway. 

7. The NF-(cid:103)B (for nuclear factor involved in the 
transcription of the (cid:103) light chain gene in B lympho-
cytes) transcription factor pathway. 

8. The integrin-actin pathway. 
   

The cAMP pathway
The  intracellular  signaling  pathway  mediated  by 
cAMP was discovered in 1958 by Earl Sutherland 
while studying the action of epinephrine, a hormone 
that breaks down glycogen into glucose before muscle 
contraction. 

When epinephrine binds to its receptor, there is an 
increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP.  
cAMP is formed  from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
by the action of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and de-
graded to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by the 
enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase. This mechanism 
led to the concept of a ﬁrst messenger (epinephrine) 
mediating  a  cell-signaling  effect  by  a  second  mes-
senger,  cAMP. The  epinephrine  receptor  is  linked 
to adenylyl cyclase by G protein, which stimulates 
cyclase activity upon epinephrine binding.

The intracellular signaling effects of cAMP (Figure 
3-6) are mediated by the enzyme cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase (or protein kinase A). In its inactive 
form, protein kinase A is a tetramer composed of 
two regulatory subunits (to which cAMP binds) and 
two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP results in 
the dissociation of the catalytic subunits. Free cata-
lytic subunits can phosphorylate serine residues on 
target proteins.

In  the  epinephrine-dependent  regulation  of  gly-
cogen metabolism, protein kinase A phosphorylates 
two enzymes:  

1. Phosphorylase kinase, which in turn phosphory-
lates glycogen phosphorylase to break down glycogen 
into glucose-1-phosphate.

2.  Glycogen  synthase,  which  is  involved  in  the 
synthesis of glycogen. Phosphorylation of glycogen 
synthase prevents the synthesis of glycogen. 

Note that an elevation of cAMP results in two 
distinct  events:  the  breakdown  of  glycogen  and, 
at the same time, a blockage of  further glycogen 
synthesis. Also note that the binding of epinephrine 
to  a  single  receptor  leads  to  a  signal  ampliﬁcation 
mechanism during intracellular signaling mediated 
by many molecules of cAMP. cAMP signal ampliﬁca-
tion is further enhanced by the phosphorylation of 
many  molecules  of  phosphorylase  kinase  and  gly-
cogen synthase by the catalytic subunits dissociated 
from protein kinase A. It is important to realize that 
protein phosphorylation can be rapidly reversed by 
protein phosphatases present in the cytosol and as 
transmembrane proteins. These protein phosphatases 
can terminate responses initiated by the activation of 
kinases by removing phosphorylated residues. 

cAMP also has an effect on the transcription of spe-
ciﬁc target genes that contain a regulatory sequence 
called the cAMP response element (CRE). Catalytic 
subunits of protein kinase A enter the nucleus after 
dissociation from the regulatory subunits. Within the 
nucleus, catalytic subunits phosphorylate a transcrip-
tion  factor  called  CRE-binding  protein  (CREB), 

96

3. CELL SIGNALING       Phospholipid–calcium pathway

which activates cAMP-inducible genes.

Finally, cAMP effects can be direct, independent 
of protein phosphorylation. An example is the direct 
regulation of ion channels in the olfactory epithe-
lium. Odorant receptors in sensory neurons of the 
olfactory epithelium are linked to G protein, which 
stimulates  adenylyl  cyclase  to  increase  intracellular 
cAMP (see Chapter 13, Respiratory System). 

cAMP  does  not  stimulate  protein  kinase  A  in 
sensory neurons but acts directly to open Na+ chan-
nels in the plasma membrane to initiate membrane 
depolarization and nerve impulses.

The cGMP pathway
cGMP  is  also  a  second  messenger.  It  is  produced 
from  guanosine  triphosphate  (GTP)  by  guanylate 
cyclase and degraded to GMP by a phosphodiesterase. 
Guanylate cyclases are activated by nitric oxide and 
peptide signaling molecules. 

The best characterized  role of cGMP is in photo-
receptor rod cells of the retina, where it converts light 
signals to nerve impulses. Chapter 9, Sensory Organs: 
Vision and Hearing, in the eye section, provides a 
detailed description of this cell signaling process.

The phospholipid–calcium  pathway 
Another second messenger involved in intracellular 
signaling derives from the phospholipid phosphati-
dylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) present in the 
inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (Figure 3-7). 
The hydrolysis of PIP2 by the enzyme phospholi-
pase C (PLC), stimulated by a number of hormones 
and growth factors, produces two second messengers: 
diacylglycerol  and  inositol  1,4,5-trisphosphate 
(IP3). These  two  messengers  stimulate  two  down-
stream signaling pathway cascades: protein kinase C 
and Ca2+ mobilization.

Two  forms  of  PLC  exist:  PLC-(cid:96)  and  PLC-(cid:97).  
PLC-(cid:96)  is  activated  by  G  protein.  PLC-(cid:97)  contains 
SH2 domains that enable association with receptor 
tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation increases 
PLC-(cid:97) activity, which in turn stimulates the break-
down of PIP2.

Diacylglycerol,  derived  from  PIP2  hydrolysis, 
activates  members  of  the  protein  kinase  C  family 
(protein serine and threonine kinases). 

Phorbol esters are tumor growth–promoting agents 
acting, like diacylglycerol, by stimulation of protein 
kinase C activities. Protein kinase C activates other 
intracellular  targets  such  as  protein  kinases  of  the 
MAP kinase pathway to phosphorylate transcription 
factors leading to changes in gene expression and cell 
proliferation.

mains  associated  with  the  plasma  membrane,  the 
other  second  messenger  IP3,  derived  from  PIP2, 
is  released  into  the  cytosol  to  activate  ion  pumps 
and free Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites. High 
cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (from a basal level of 
0.1 (cid:43)M to an increased 1.0 (cid:43)M concentration after 
cytosolic  release)  activate  several  Ca2+-dependent 
protein kinases and phosphatases. 

Calmodulin is a Ca2+-dependent protein that is ac-
tivated when the Ca2+ concentration increases to 0.5 
(cid:43)M.  Ca2+-calmodulin complexes bind to a number 
of cytosolic target proteins to regulate cell responses. 
Note that Ca2+ is an important second messen-
ger and that its intracellular concentration can be 
increased not only by its release from intracellular 
storage sites but also by increasing the entry of Ca2+ 
into the cell from the extracellular space.  The regu-
lation of myosin light chain kinase activity by the 

calcium-calmodulin pathway is described in Chapter 
1, Epithelium.

The Ras, Raf, and MAP kinase pathway
This  pathway  involves  evolutionarily  conserved 
protein kinases (yeast to humans) with roles in cell 
growth and differentiation. MAP kinases are protein 
serine  and  threonine  kinases  activated  by  growth 
factors and other signaling molecules (Figure 3-8).  
A  well-characterized  form  of  MAP  kinase  is  the 
ERK family. Members of the ERK (for extracellular 
signal–regulated  kinase)  family  act  through  either 
protein  tyrosine  kinase  or  G  protein–associated 
receptors.  Both  cAMP  and  Ca2+-dependent  path-
ways can stimulate or inhibit the ERK pathway in 
different cell types.

The activation of ERK is mediated by two protein 
kinases:  Raf,  a  protein  serine  or  threonine  kinase, 
which, in turn, activates a second kinase called MEK
(for MAP kinase or ERK kinase). Stimulation of a 
growth factor receptor leads to the activation of the 
GTP-binding  protein  Ras  (for  rat  sarcoma  virus), 
which interacts with Raf.  Raf phosphorylates and 
activates MEK, which then activates ERK by phos-
phorylation of serine and threonine residues. ERK 
then  phosphorylates  nuclear  and  cytosolic  target 
proteins. 

In the nucleus, activated ERK phosphorylates the 
transcription factors Elk-1 (for E-26-like protein 1) 
and serum response factor (SRF), which recognize 
the regulatory sequence called serum response ele-
ment (SRE).

In addition to ERK, mammalian cells contain two 
other MAP kinases called JNK and p38 MAP kinases. 
Cytokines,  heat  shock  and  ultraviolet  irradiation 
stimulate JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation medi-
ated by small GTP-binding proteins different from 
Ras. These kinases are not activated by MEK but by 
a distinct dual kinase called MKK (for MAP kinase 
kinase).  JNK kinases have been associated with the 
development of insulin restistance.

A key element in the ERK pathway are the Ras 
proteins,  a  group  of  oncogenic  proteins  of  tumor 
viruses that cause sarcomas in rats. Mutations in the 
Ras  gene  have  been  linked  to  human  cancer.  Ras 
proteins  are  guanine  nucleotide–binding  protein 
with functional properties similar to the G protein 
(cid:95)  subunits  (activated  by  GTP  and  inactivated  by 
guanosine diphosphate [GDP]).

 A difference with G protein is that Ras proteins 
do not associate with (cid:96)(cid:97) subunits. Ras is activated 
by guanine nucleotide exchange factors to facilitate 
the release of GDP in exchange for GTP. The activ-
ity of the Ras-GTP complex is terminated by GTP 
hydrolysis, which is stimulated by GTPase-activating 
proteins. 

In human cancers, mutation of Ras genes results

mutated  Ras  protein  remains  continuously  in  the 
active GTP-bound form.

The JAK-STAT pathway
The  preceding  MAP  kinase  pathway  links  the  cell 
surface to the nucleus signaling mediated by a protein 
kinase cascade leading to the phosphorylation of tran-
scription factors. The development of the erythroid 
lineage (red blood cell formation) in bone marrow 
stimulated by erythropoietin involves the JAK-STAT 
pathway (see Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis).
The JAK-STAT pathway provides a  close connec-
tion between protein tyrosine kinases and transcrip-
tion factors by directly affecting transcription factors 
(Figure 3-9). 

STAT  (for  signal  transducers  and  activators  of 
transcription)  proteins  are  transcription  factors 
with an SH2 domain. STAT proteins are present in 
the cytoplasm in an inactive state. Stimulation of a 
receptor by ligand binding recruits STAT proteins, 
which bind to the cytoplasmic portion of  receptor-
associated  JAK  protein  tyrosine  kinase  through 
their  SH2  domain  and  become  phosphorylated. 
Phosphorylated  STAT  proteins  then  dimerize  and

translocate into the nucleus, where they activate the 
transcription of target genes.

NF-(cid:103)B transcription factor pathway 
NF-(cid:103)B (for nuclear factor involved in the transcrip-
tion of the (cid:103) light chain gene in B lymphocytes) is 
a transcription factor involved in immune responses 
in several cells. NF-(cid:103)B is activated by protein kinase 
C (Figure 3-10). 

In  its  inactive  state,  the  NF-(cid:103)B  protein  het-
erodimer is bound to the inhibitory subunit I-(cid:103)B 
and the complex is retained in the cytoplasm. The 
phosphorylation of I-(cid:103)B, triggered by protein kinase 
C, leads to the destruction of  I-(cid:103)B by the 26S pro-
teasome and the release of NF-(cid:103)B. The free NF-(cid:103)B 
heterodimer translocates into the nucleus to activate 
gene transcription in response to immunologic and 
inﬂammatory signaling. 

The integrin-actin pathway
As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  Epithelium,  integrin 
heterodimers are cell surface receptors that interact 
with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin 
cytoskeleton  through  intermediary  proteins.  Cell 
adhesion to the ECM is essential for embryonic de-
velopment, tissue stability, homing and homeostasis. 
Actin relationship to integrins enables not only a 
mechanical role of F-actin in cell adhesion buy also 
the transmission of chemical signals inside the cell 
initiated  at  the  ECM.  Although  integrin  subunits 
(cid:95)  and  (cid:96)  do  not  have  an  intrinsic  kinase  domain, 
they  utilize  associated  proteins  to  transmit  signals. 
Integrin-mediated interaction between the ECM and 
the actin cytoskeleton generally takes place at focal 
adhesion  sites  on  the  cell  surface  where  integrins 
aggregate. 

As shown in Figure 1-11 in Chapter 1, Epithelium, 
talin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of  (cid:96) subunit 
of integrin. Vinculin does not interact directly with 
(cid:96) subunit tails, but interacts with talin and (cid:95)-actinin; 
the latter interacts with F-actin. Focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK),  which  interacts  with  talin,  phosphorylates  
their associated proteins, including paxillin.  These 
interactions determine a conformational change that 
enables the extracellular domain of integrins to in-
crease their binding afﬁnity for extracellular  ligands. 
As you recall, the (cid:96) subunit of integrin binds to the 
RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) domain pres-
ent in laminin and ﬁbronectin, two ligands present 
in the ECM.

General Pathology: Speciﬁc signaling pathways
There are additional signaling pathways with impor-
tant roles in embryonic and fetal development, body 
axis patterning, cell migration and cell proliferation. 
All of them contain numerous components subject 
to diverse regulatory steps and crosstalk mechanisms.

The clinical relevance and multifunctional nature 
of these pathways are represented by mutations lead-
ing to a number of diseases. We will refer to these 
pathways in several chapters. 

General Pathology: Stem cell niches and stemness
Cells in the body show a remarkable range in ability 
to divide and grow. Some cells (for example, nerve 
cells and erythrocytes) reach a mature, differentiated 
state and usually do not divide. Such cells are referred 
to as postmitotic cells. 

Other  cells,  called  stem  cells,  show  continuous 
division throughout life (for example, epithelial cells 
lining the intestine and stem cells that give rise to 
the various blood cell types). Many other cells are 
intermediate between these two extremes and remain 
quiescent most of the time but can be triggered to 
divide by appropriate signals. Liver cells are an ex-
ample. If the liver is damaged, cell division can be 

triggered to compensate for the lost cells.

Stem cells have three properties (Figure 3-11): 
1. Self-renewal.
2. Proliferation.
3. Differentiation. 
These  properties  depend  in  part  on  the  speciﬁc 
microenvironment  where  they  reside,  called  stem 
cell niche. The stem cell niche provides stem cells the 
appropriate signals to remain into a quiescent state, 
preventing their progression towards ﬁnal differentia-
tion, or to become activated. 

The interplay between the stem cell niche and the 
cellular state of a stem cell is governed by stemness.
Stemness is the characteristic gene expression proﬁle 
of different stem cells not observed in ordinary, non-
stem cells. Stemness genes (enriched in stem cells) 
include Nanog, Oct4, Myc, Sox2 and Klf4 (Krüpel-like 
factor 4). The concept of stemness is relevant to the 
pursuit of reprogramming other cells into stem cells, 
the realm of regenerative medicine.

Stem  cells  have  the  potential  to  generate  a  large 
number  of  mature  cells  continuously  throughout 
life.  When  stem  cells  divide  by  mitosis,  some  of 
the progeny differentiates into  a speciﬁc cell type. 
Other progeny remains as stem cells within the stem 
cell niche. 

The intestinal epithelium, the epidermis of the skin, 
the hematopoietic system, and spermatogenic cells of 
the seminiferous epithelium share this property. We  
discuss in detail the signiﬁcance of stem cells in each 
of these tissues in the appropriate chapters.

Key functions: Involved in switching Gli factors from transcriptional repressors into 
activators in the cytoplasm to allow HH-specific transcriptional events. 
Pathway: HH proteins bind to the receptor PTCH1 and then signal through SMO, 
a transmembrane protein, to regulate gene transcription by repressing or activating 
Gli3, a transcription factor. If SMO is not present, Sufu permits the truncated Gli3 
repressor to block HH-specific gene expression. If SMO is present, activated 
full-length Gli2A translocates to the cell nucleus to regulate HH-specific gene 
expression (the expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, Myc and Patched).
HH ligands: Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh) and Desert (Dhh).
Pathogenesis: Gorlin syndrome, basal cell carcinoma (skin), medulloblastoma.

Key functions: Regulation of stem cell differentiation during development through 
(cid:96)-catenin–dependent or (cid:96)-catenin–independent pathways. This pathway integrates 
signals from other signaling pathways (FGF, TGF-(cid:96) and BMP).
Pathway: In the (cid:96)-catenin-dependent pathway, Wnt secretory glycoprotein 
binds to FZD receptor and coreceptors LRP5/LRP6 to stabilize (cid:96)-catenin in the 
cytoplasm. Then, (cid:96)-catenin translocates to the nucleus and stimulates the 
transcription of Wnt target genes by interacting with the coactivators LEF1 
(lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1) and TCF (T cell factor) 1, TCF3 and TCF4 
(not shown). In the (cid:96)-catenin independent pathway, Wnt protein induces G 
protein-coupled phosphatidylinositol to activate PKC(cid:98).
Pathogenesis: Point mutations of (cid:96)-catenin in human colorectal tumors prevent 
phosphorylation of the kinase GSK-3(cid:96)(cid:3)(see Chapter 16, Lower Digestive Segment).

Transcription factor

Key functions: The  Notch signaling pathway mediated cell-cell communication 
(juxtacrine cellular signaling) by direct cell-cell contact.
Pathway: Following ligand binding (JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DDL3 and DLL4), Notch 
receptors (1 to 4) undergo proteolytic cleavage catalyzed by the (cid:97)-secretase 
complex that includes presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS2. The intracellular domain (NICD) 
of Notch receptor is released from the plasma membrane and translocates to the 
nucleus. In the nucleus, NICD interacts with the transcription factor CSL and 
activates the transcription of target genes (such as HES and HEY family of 
transcription factors, not shown) to regulate the expression of other genes.
Pathogenesis: The nuclear accumulation of NICD is obsereved in acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma.  Non-functional Notch receptor and 
ligands are implicated in the autosomal dominant form of cerebral arteriopathy. 

Regenerative medicine by cell reprogramming
Following stress and injury, other tissues, such as the 
liver, muscle, and the nervous system, can regenerate 
mature cells. For example, bone marrow stem cells 
can produce muscle tissue as well as hematopoietic 
tissue in an appropriate host system (see Chapter 7, 
Muscle Tissue).  Cultured  stem  cells  of  the  central 
nervous  system  are  capable  of  hematopoiesis  in 
transplanted irradiated mouse recipients.

Recall  that  embryonic  stem  cells,  forming  the 
inner cell mass (embryoblast) of the early embryo 
(the blastocyst), have the potential to differentiate 
into almost all tissues and organs except the placenta. 
Patient-derived pluripotent embryonic stem cells, 
matching  genetically  the  own  cells  of  a  patient, 
provide an experimental source of medically useful 
differentiating tissues (such as pancreatic islets for the 
treatment of diabetes, skin for the treatment of burns 

and wounds, regenerating cartilage for the treatment 
of  arthritis,  and  endothelial  cells  for  the  repair  of 
blood vessels affected by arteriosclerosis) and reduce 
the risk of rejection by the immune system.

Three cell reprogramming methods have been used 
in  culture  to  produce  patient-derived  pluripotent 
embryonic stem cells: 

1. To induce programmed stem cells (iPS) from 
mature cells grown in the presence of  a transcription 
factor cocktail. 

2.  By somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), or 
cloning, consisting in the removal of the nucleus from 
an  egg  and  replaced  with  the  nucleus  of  a  mature 
donor somatic cell. As the embryo develops, nuclear 
transfer embryonic cells (NT ES) are removed from 
the inner cell mass. Note that NT ES are genetically 
matched to the donor cell.

Key functions: BMPs are members of the TGF-(cid:96) superfamily and regulate cell 
growth, differentiation, and development in a wide range of biological processes by 
activating SMAD proteins. 
Pathway: BMP/TGF-(cid:96)(cid:3)ligands induce the oligomerization of serine/ threonine 
receptor kinases and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic signaling molecules 
SMAD2 and SMAD3 for the TGF-β pathway, or SMAD1/5/8 for the BMP pathway.  
The common SMAD4 transducer translocates to the nucleus. Activated SMADs 
regulate several biological processes by cell-specific modulation of transcription.
Pathogenesis: TGF-(cid:96) is a tumor suppressor of pre-malignant cells but enhances 
invasion and metastasis of more advanced carcinomas. Mutations of SMAD4 genes 
are frequent in gastrointestinal and pancreatic tumors. TGF-(cid:96)(cid:3)and BMP can be 
involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; see Box 3-F).

Key functions: The FGF signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of several 
developmental processes including patterning, morphogenesis, differentiation, cell 
proliferation or migration.
Pathway: Ligand binding to tyrosine kinase FGF receptors 1 to 4, results in the 
dimerization and subsequent transactivation by phosphorylation of tyrosine 
residues.  The four main activated signaling pathways are:  JAK/STAT (not shown), 
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (not shown), Phospholipase C-(cid:97) (PLC(cid:97)(cid:9) and 
MAPK/ERK. MAPK/ERK translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates specific 
transcription factors. PIP2: phosphatidyl-inositol; IP3: inositol-triphosphate; DAG:

mass of embryos derived from in vitro fertilization 
(IVF) to generate unprogrammed embryonic stem 
cells (IVF ES). 

Although  human  pluripotent  stem  cells  are  im-
portant for regenerative medicine, there are poten-
tial  complication  derived  from  the  three  available 
approaches. For example, human iPS are not fully 
reprogrammed and have epigenetic differences with 
NT ES and IVF ES. As we discuss in Chapter 20, 
Spermatogenesis,  epigenetic  deﬁnes  the  genomic 
modiﬁcations that impact on gene expression without 
modifying DNA sequence. 

 Box 3-F  |  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)

• Epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurs when epithelial cells lose intercel-
lular junctions, adhesion molecules and apical–basolateral polarity and become 
migratory and even invasive, as in the case of cancer.
• Epithelial cells adopt a mesenchymal phenotype: they establish interactions with  
the extracellular matrix, lose cell-cell contacts by downregulating the expression 
of E-cadherin, disrupt their apical-basal polarity and reorganize their cytoskel-
eton.
• Induction of EMT involves the activation of SNAIL transcription factors to 
repress E-cadherin and the nuclear translocation of SMAD proteins in response 
to key transcription factor activation of TGF-(cid:96)/BMP and Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin signaling.
• EMT is classiﬁed as: (1) Type 1 EMT, that takes place during embryonic devel-
opment. An example are cells of the neural crest that become mobile and migrate 
and localize into various organs. (2) Type 2 EMT, that is observed during ﬁbrosis 
following tissue injury and inﬂammation. An example is ﬁbrogenesis, that occurs 
during chronic liver disease and can lead to cirrhosis. (3) Type 3 EMT, that oc-
curs in cancer and metastasis when tumor cells disassemble cell-cell contacts. 

At present, IVF ES exhibit properties close to the 
intact blastocysts but they are allogenic (they exhibit 
properties close to the intact blastocysts but are ge-
netically different and potentially incompatible when 
transplanted).  NT ES are epigenetically stable (like 
IVF ES) and histocompatible (like iPS).

  

Cell culture
Cell culture techniques have been a powerful tool for 
examining the factors that regulate cell growth and for 
comparing the properties of normal and cancer cells.
Many cells grow in tissue culture, but some are 
much easier to grow than others. Culture medium 
contains salts, amino acids, vitamins, and a source 
of  energy  such  as  glucose.  In  addition,  most  cells 
require  a  number  of  hormones  or  growth  factors 
for sustained culture and cell division. These factors 
are  usually  provided  by  addition  of  serum  to  the 
culture medium. 

For some cell types the components supplied by 
serum have been identiﬁed, and these cells can be 
grown  in  serum-free,  hormone  and  growth  fac-
tor–supplemented medium. Some of these factors 
are hormones, such as insulin, and growth factors, 
including EGF,  FGF, and PDGF.

When normal cells are placed in culture in the pres-
ence of adequate nutrients and growth factors, they 
will grow until they cover the bottom of the culture 
dish, forming a monolayer.  Further cell division then 
ceases. This is called density-dependent inhibition

of growth. The cells become quiescent but can be 
triggered to enter the cell cycle and divide again by 
an additional dose of growth factor or by replating 
at a lower cell density.

Cells cultured from a tissue can be kept growing 
and dividing by regularly replating the cells at lower 
density once they become conﬂuent. After about 50 
cell divisions, however, the cells begin to stop dividing 
and the cultures become senescent. 

The  number  of  divisions  at  which  this  occurs 
depends  on  the  age  of  the  individual  from  which 
the initial cells were taken. Cells from an embryo, 
human  embryonic  stem  cells  (HESCs),  have  two 
unique properties: self-renewal (the ability to pro-

identity), and pluripotency (the ability to differenti-
ate into all the cell types of the embryo). Yet, HESCs 
share  cellular  and  molecular  aspects  with  tumor 
cells: rapid proliferation, lack of contact inhibition, 
genomic  instability,  high  telomerase  activity  and 
high expression of oncogenes. When injected into 
immunodeﬁcient  mice,  HESCs  form  teratomas, 
benign  tumors  consisting  of  differentiated  tissues 
from all three germinal layers. HESCs can also form 
teratocarcinomas, aggressive tumors representing the 
malignant equivalents of the teratomas.

(self-renewal)

Stem cells have three characteristics: self- 
renewal, proliferation, and differentiation into 
mature cells. Stem cells are housed in niches 
consisting of stromal cells that provide factors for 
their maintenance. 
   Stem cells of the embryo can give rise to cell 
precursors that generate all the tissues of the body. 
This property defines stem cells as multipotent.
   Stem cells are difficult to identify morphologically. 
Their identification is based on specific cell surface 
markers (cell surface antigens recognized by 
specific monoclonal antibodies) and on the lineage 
they generate following transplantation. 
    Three typical examples are the stem cells of 
bone marrow, intestine, and testes.  

  Occasionally, cells that would normally stop grow-
ing become altered and appear to become immortal. 
Such cells are called a cell line.  Cell lines are very 
useful experimentally and still show most of the phe-
notype and growth characteristics of the original cells.
An additional change known as transformation is 
associated with the potential for malignant growth. 
Transformed  cells  no  longer  show  normal  growth 
control and have many alterations, such as anchorage-
independent growth. In contrast, normal cells grow 
when anchored to a solid substrate.

Cells in culture can be transformed by chemical 
carcinogens  or  by  infection  with  certain  viruses 
(tumor viruses). Tumor viruses will also cause tumors 
in certain host animals, but in different species they 
may cause ordinary infections. Cancer cells cultured 
from tumors also show the characteristics of trans-
formation. We will discuss the role of retroviruses in 
carcinogenesis at the end of this chapter.

General Pathology: Cellular senescence and cancer
Aging  is  the  gradual  decline  over  time  in  cell  and 
tissue function that often, not always, decreases the  
longevity of an individual. Cellular senescence (Latin 
senex,  old  man  or  old  age)  speciﬁes  the  molecular 
aspects of loss of function of mitotic cells during ag-
ing. Senescence is used interchangeably with aging. 
At older age, cellular senescence in humans deter-
mines typical pathologies, including atherosclerosis 
(leading to brain stroke), heart failure, osteoporosis, 
macular  degeneration,  cardiopulmonary  and  renal 
failure  and  neurodegenerative  diseases  such  as  Al-
zheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

1        ATP depletion and an increase of ROS (superoxide, hydrogen 
peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) impact on several cellular activities 
that may lead to necrosis or apoptosis, depending on the type and 
intensity of an injury and the characteristics of the injured cell.
2
        Nonfunctional ATP-dependent pumps fail to regulate the normal 
influx and efflux of electrolytes and water. An increase in intracellular 
Ca2+ activates cytosolic enzymes (proteases, phospholipases, 
endonucleases and ATPases) and enhance mitochondrial 

permeability (a process called mitochondrial permeability 
transition).
       Lysosomal membrane damage determines the leakage of 
3
hydrolytic lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol. 
       Persistence of mitochondrial damage leads to either necrosis 
4
or apoptosis (triggered by the leakage of mitochondrial cytochrome 
c). Activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation and formation of 
apoptotic bodies take place. 

An irreversible arrest in cell proliferation takes place 
when senescent cells experience DNA damage at telo-
meres and  mitogenic signalling fail to prompt them 
to resume the cell cycle.  In our discussion of mitosis 
(see Figure 1-51 in Chapter 1, Epithelium),  we call 
attention to the role of telomerase, an enzyme that 
maintains the ends of chromosomes, or telomeres. 
In  normal  cells,  insufﬁcient  telomerase  activity 
limits  the  number  of  mitotic  divisions  and  forces 
the cell into senescence. Telomere shortening and 
the limited life span of a cell are regarded as potent 
tumor suppressor mechanisms. Most human tumors 
express  human  telomerase  reverse  transcriptase 
(hTERT). The ectopic expression of hTERT in pri-
mary human cells confers endless growth in culture. 
The use of telomerase inhibitors in cancer patients 
is currently being pursued. 
 
General Pathology: Cell and tissue injury
Cell and tissue injury consists in a number of bio-
chemical  and  morphologic  changes  resulting  from 
exogenous or endogenous causes leading to a revers-
ible or irreversible disruption of normal cell function 
(Figure 3-12). 

Exogenous  causes  of  injury  include  physical 
injury  (trauma),  thermal  injury    (heat  or  cold), 
radiation injury (ultraviolet light or ionizing radia-

tion), chemical  injury (caustic material), bacterial 
toxicity  (cholera  toxin  inducing  watery  diarrhea),
drug toxicity (mercury toxicity to the kidneys) and 
environmental injury (air pollutants). Endogenous 
causes of injury include genetic defects (inborn errors 
of metabolism) and nutritional deﬁciency (intestinal 
malabsorption resulting from celiac disease).

The most relevant causes of cell injury are hypoxia, 
determined by a decrease in the supply of oxygen, and 
anoxia,  caused  by  a  complete  block  in  the  oxygen 
supply. Hypoxia and anoxia result from inadequate 
oxygen supply (low concentration of oxygen in air at 
high altitude, drowning or lung disease), a failure in 
oxygen transport in blood (anemia), a disruption in 
blood ﬂow (ischemia, determined by heart failure), 
blood vessel obstruction (thrombosis or embolism), 
disruption in blood supply (rupture of an aneurysm) 
or a consequence of inhibition of cellular respiration 
(cyanide poisoning). 

Complete  ischemia  by  blockage  of  an  arterial 
branch of the coronary artery causes infarction of the 
cardiac muscle supplied by that blood vessel. If the 
occluded blood vessel is reopened soon after ischemic 
injury  (by  angioplasty  and  thrombolysis),  injured 
cardiocytes may recover by reperfusion. Irreversibly 
injured cardiocytes may not recover by reperfusion.
 Reperfusion may be detrimental to viable cardio-

oxygen metabolism, are active chemical compounds 
that react with lipids, proteins and DNA. Free radicals 
damage cell membranes by lipid peroxidation, cause 
DNA  breakage  and  inactivate  enzymes  by  protein 
crosslinking  when protective mechanisms (such as 
superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) are 
not functional. 

Recall that oxygen is essential for aerobic respira-
tion. Hypoxia disrupts normal oxidative phosphory-
lation to the point that the capacity of mitochondria 

to generate ATP is reduced. ATP provides energy for 
the function of Na+/K+ ATPase pumps, necessary for 
maintaining high concentration of sodium in the ex-
tracellular space and high concentration of potassium 
inside the cell.  The unregulated cell inﬂux of sodium, 
calcium and water from the extracellular space and 
the leakage of potassium out of the cell result in cell 
swelling (see Figure 3-12). 

Severe cell injury can be monitored by the release 
of  cytoplasmic  enzymes  into  the  blood,  such  as 
creatinine kinase (skeletal or cardiac muscle injury), 
aspartate aminotransferase, AST, and alanine ami-
notransferase, ALT (injured hepatocytes), and lactate 
dehydrogenase, LDH (disrupted cells, including red 
blood cells).

Depending on the removal or persistence of the 
cause and the cell type, cell injury can be reversible 
or  irreversible.  Irreversible  cell  injury  leads  to  cell 
death, or necrosis (Greek nekrós, dead) or apoptosis.  

General Pathology: Necrosis  
Necrosis can be recognized by speciﬁc microscopic 
and macroscopic changes (Figure 3-13). Microscopi-
cally, in addition to cell membrane breakdown caused 
by cell swelling, the cell nucleus displays pyknosis 
(Greek pyknos, crowed; osis, condition; condensation 
of  chromatin),  karyolysis  (Greek  karyon,  nucleus;  
lysis, dissolution; breakdown of chromatin by endo-
nucleases) and karyorrhexis (Greek karyon + rhexis, 
rupture;  presence  of  fragmented  chromatin  in  the 
cytoplasm).

Several forms of necrosis can be recognized at the 

macroscopic level. 

1. Coagulative necrosis, the most common form 
of  necrosis  resulting  from  vascular  occlusion,  is 

characterized by a paler than normal tissue area that 
retains  its  overall  shape  but  all  cell  functions  have 
stopped. The initial inﬂammatory response (inﬁltra-
tion of neutrophils during the ﬁrst 24 and 48 hours) 
is followed days later by the eosinophilic staining of 
anucleated cell remnants. An example is myocardial 
infarct,  caused  by  ischemia  associated  to  blockage 
of a branch of the coronary artery (see Figure 3-13). 
2.  Liquefactive  necrosis  is  recognized  by  the 
softening of the necrotic tissue caused by hydrolytic 
lysosomal enzymes released from dead cells and neu-
trophils. Examples include brain infarct, wherein the 
necrotic tissue is removed by macrophages and the 
remaining cavity is ﬁlled by ﬂuid derived from the 
surrounding  brain  interstitial  spaces;  an  abscess,  a 
localized purulent infection of the affected organ or 
tissue, deﬁned by a cavity occupied with pus (lique-
ﬁed tissue previously inﬁltrated with neutrophils, see 
Figure 3-13); and wet gangrene of extremities, seen 
in patients with diabetes, resulting from the tissue 
liqueﬁed action of enzymes released from infecting 
bacteria (Clostridium perfringens). 

3. The  crumble  consistency  and  opaque  aspect 
of  the  necrotic  tissue  in  caseous  necrosis,  found 
tuberculous and histoplasmosis granulomas (nodular 
inﬂammatory lesions), mimics cottage cheese. 

4. Fat necrosis occurs after enzymatic and trau-

matic injury. 

Enzymatic  fat  necrosis  involves  adipose  tissue 
within and around the pancreas. The release of lipases 
from exocrine pancreatic cells during acute pancre-
atitis destroys the plasma membrane of adipose cells 
followed by the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty 
acids. Fatty acids combine with interstitial calcium, 
giving the necrotic adipose tissue a chalky white ap-
pearance by a process called fat saponiﬁcation (Latin 
sapon, soap). 

Traumatic fat necrosis is the consequence of trau-
matic injury (sports and accidents affecting adipose 
tissue of the breasts, thigh and other locations).

5. Fibrinoid necrosis is restricted to the smooth 
muscle  wall  of  small  arteries,  arterioles  and  renal 
glomeruli affected by autoimmune diseases such as 
systemic  lupus  erythematosus.  Fibrin-like  eosino-
philic material impregnates the vascular wall. It can 
be recognized under the microscope because it does 
not have distinct macroscopic features.

General Pathology: Apoptosis 
Under normal physiologic conditions, cells deprived 
of survival factors, damaged, or senescent commit sui-
cide through an orderly regulated cell death program 
called  apoptosis  (Greek  apo,  off;  ptosis,  fall). Viral 
infection can induce apoptosis to prevent viral replica-
tion, viral dissemination or persistent viral infection 
of the cell. Anticancer drugs as inducers of apoptosis 
of cancer cells represent a therapeutic strategy.

Pyroptosis

Pyroptosis is a specialized form of programmed cell 
death that involves the activity of caspase 1. It is 
characterized by cell swelling, plasma membrane 
breakdown, and DNA fragmentation. The cytoplasmic 
content is released into the extracellular space to 

enhance inflammatory and repair responses.  
   In contrast to pyroptotic cells, apoptotic cells fail to 
trigger inflammatory responses because cell 
components are packaged in apoptotic bodies, and (2) 
caspase 1 is not involved in the induction of apoptosis.

4      Procaspases consist of 
two subunits (p10 and p20) 
and an N-terminal recruitment 
domain.
    Caspases can be upstream 
initiators with a long 
N-terminal prodomain called 
CARD (such as procaspase 8) 
or downstream executioners 
with a short N-terminal 
prodomain called DED (such 
as procaspase 3). Activated 
caspases are heterotetramers. 
Upstream caspases can 
activate downstream 
executioner caspases.

      Activated caspase 8 can

DNAse. CAD migrates to the

cytochrome c into the 
cytoplasm.

      Activated caspases

cleave two DNA repair 
enzymes (PARP and DNA 
protein kinase). DNA 
fragmentation proceeds 
undisturbed.

Apoptosis is different from necrosis. As we have 
seen, necrosis is a nonphysiologic process that occurs 
after acute injury (for example, in an ischemic stroke). 
Necrotic cells lyse and release cytoplasmic and nuclear 
contents  into  the  environment,  thus  triggering  an 
inﬂammatory reaction. 

Cells undergoing apoptosis lose intercellular adhe-
sion, fragment the chromatin, and break down into 
small  blebs  called  apoptotic  bodies  (Figure  3-14). 
Apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed by macrophages 
and inﬂammation does not occur. 

Apoptotic  cell  death  is  observed  during  normal 

fetal  development.  For  example,  the  formation  of 
ﬁngers and toes of the fetus requires the elimination 
by apoptosis of the tissue between them. During fetal 
development of the central nervous system, an excess 
of neurons, eliminated later by apoptosis, is required 
to  establish  appropriate  connections  or  synapses 
between them (see Chapter 8, Nervous Tissue). The 
regression of the embryonic müllerian duct in the 
male fetus is triggered by Sertoli cell-derived anti-
müllerian hormone, AMH (see Chapter 21, Sperm 
Transport and Maturation).

2
and OMM.
        Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 blocks Bax, which 
3
facilitates the release of cytochrome c and

        During apoptosis, cytochrome c and 
4
SIMPs are released across the OMM and 
interact with apoptosis protease activating 
factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome 
(together with ATP and procascapse 9).         
   Apaf-1 activates procaspase 9. Caspase 9 
activates caspase 7 and caspase 10 leading to 
the proteolytic destruction of the cell.
        Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a

mitochondrial protein that can be released into 
the cytoplasm, migrate to the cell nucleus, bind 
to DNA and trigger DNA fragmentation in the 
absence of caspases.

trium during the premenstrual phase and the regres-
sion of the corpus luteum in the ovary are determined 
by a hormonal-regulated ischemia and consequent 
hypoxia (see Chapter 22, Follicle Development and 
The Menstrual Cycle).  

Mature  granulocytes  in  peripheral  blood  have  a 
life span of 1 to 2 days before undergoing apoptosis. 
The  clonal  selection  of   T  cells  in  the  thymus 
(to  eliminate  self-reactive  lymphocytes  to  prevent 
autoimmune  diseases;  see  Chapter  10,  Immune-
Lymphatic System) and cellular immune responses 
involve apoptosis.

What a nematode worm told us about apoptosis
The genetic and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis  
emerged from studies of the nematode worm Cae-
norhabditis elegans, in which 131 cells are precisely 
killed and 959 remain. 

In this worm, four genes are required for the or-
derly cell death program: ced-3 (for cell death defec-
tive-3), ced-4, egl-1 (for egg laying-1), and ced-9. The 
products of the ﬁrst three genes mediate cell death.  
The gene ced-9 is an inhibitor of apoptosis. 

The  proteins  encoded  by  these  four  genes  in 
the  worm  are  found  in  vertebrates.  Protein  ced-3 
is  homologous  to  caspases;  ced-4  corresponds  to 
Apaf-1 (for apoptotic protease activating factor-1), 
ced-9 to Bcl-2 (for B-cell leukemia-2); and egl-1 is 
homologous to Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3)-only 
proteins.

Extrinsic and intrinsic signals of apoptosis
Extrinsic and intrinsic signals determine cell apopto-
sis. Extrinsic signals bind to cell surface receptors (for 
example, Fas ligand and granzyme B/perforin) (Figure 
3-15). Intrinsic signals (for example, the release of 
cytochrome c from mitochondria) can trigger cell 
death (see Figure 3-15 and Figure 3-16).

Fas receptor (also known as APO-1 or CD95) is 
a cell membrane protein that belongs to the TNF  
receptor family (already discussed in the Cytokine 
receptor  and  ligand  section).  Fas  receptor  has  an 
intracellular cell death domain. 

Fas  ligand  binds  to  Fas  receptor  and  causes  its 
trimerization. Fas ligand initiates programmed cell 
death by binding to the Fas receptor and triggers a 
cell  signaling  cascade  consisting  of  the  sequential 
activation of procaspases into active caspases. The 
trimerized  cell  death  domain  recruits  procaspase 
8  through  the  FADD  (for  Fas-associated  protein 
with death domain) adaptor and forms a DISC (for 
death-inducing signaling complex). DISC consists 
of Fas receptor, FADD, and procaspase 8.

Procaspase 8 autoactivated at DISC becomes active 

caspase 8. Active caspase 8 can do two things: 

1. It can process procaspase 3 to active caspase 3, 
which can cleave several cellular proteins, including 
ICAD (for inhibitor of CAD) giving rise to CAD. 
CAD (for caspase-activated DNAse) is released from 
ICAD, translocates to the cell nucleus, and breaks 
down chromosomal DNA.

2. Caspase 8 can cleave Bid, a proapoptotic mem-
ber of the Bcl-2 family. The truncated Bid translocates 
to  mitochondria  to  release  cytochrome  c  into  the 
cytoplasm. 

As discussed in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic 
System, a cytotoxic T cell destroys a target cell (for 
example, a virus-infected cell) by the activation of 
procaspase  8  by  the  combined  Fas/Fas  ligand  and 
granzyme B/perforin pathways. 

Remember that caspase activation, the key event of 
apoptosis, involves two extrinsic pathways: the Fas/
Fas ligand and the granzyme B/perforin pathways and 
an intrinsic pathway, the mitochondrial cytochrome 
c pathway (see Concept Mapping in Figure 3-13)

  

Caspases: Initiators and executioners of cell death
Caspases (for cysteine aspartic acid–speciﬁc prote-
ases) exist as inactive precursors (procaspases), which 
are activated to  produce directly or indirectly cellular 
morphologic changes during apoptosis. 

Procaspases  consist  of  two  subunits  (p10  and 
p20)  and  an  N-terminal  recruitment  domain  (see 
Figure 3-15).  Activated caspases are heterotetramers 
consisting of two p10 subunits and two p20 subunits 
derived from two procaspases. 

Caspases can be upstream initiators and down-
stream executioners. Upstream initiators are activated 
by  the  cell-death  signal  (for  example,  Fas  ligand 
or TNFL).  Upstream  initiator  caspases  activate 
downstream  caspases,  which  directly  mediate  cell 
destruction. 

Completion of the cell death process occurs when 
executioner caspases activate the DNA degradation 
machinery. Caspases cleave two DNA repair enzymes 
(poly-ADP–ribose polymerase  [PARP], and DNA 
protein kinase), and unrestricted fragmentation of 
chromatin occurs.

As you realize, the key event in caspase-mediated 
cell  death  is  the  regulatory  activation  of  initiator 
caspases. 

Upstream (initiator) procaspases include procas-
pases 8, 9, and 10 with a long N-terminal prodomain 
called  CARD  (for  caspase-recruiting  domain). 
Downstream  (executioner)  procaspases  comprise 
procaspases  3,  6,  and  7  with  a  short  N-terminal 
prodomain called DED (for death-effector domain). 
Caspase activation takes place when a caspase-spe-
ciﬁc regulatory molecule (for example, FADD) binds 
to the CARD/DED domain. Caspase activation may 
become out of control and destroy the cell. To prevent 
this uncontrolled event, inhibitors of apoptosis are 
available to interact with modulators of cell death, 
thus preventing unregulated caspase activation.  

Intrinsic pathway: Mitochondrial cytochrome c 
Cytochrome c is a component of the mitochondria 
electron-transporting chain involved in the produc-

tion of ATP, and also a trigger of the caspase cascade. 
The  cell  death  pathway  can  be  activated  when 
cytochrome  c  is  released  from  the  mitochondria 
into  the  cytoplasm.  How  does  cytochrome  c  leave 
mitochondria? To answer this question, we need to 
consider aspects of members of the Bcl-2 family. 

Bcl-2  family  members  can  have  proapoptotic 
or  antiapoptotic  activities.  Bcl-2  and  Bcl-xL  have  
antiapoptotic activity. Bax, Bak, Bid, and Bad are 
proapoptotic proteins. Bcl-2 is associated with the 
outer  mitochondrial  membrane  of  viable  cells  and 
prevents  Bax  from  punching  holes  in  the  outer 
mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome c to 
leak out. A balance between proapoptotic Bax and 
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins controls the release of 
cytochrome c.  

In  the  cytoplasm,  leaking  cytochrome  c,  in  the 
presence of ATP, soluble internal membrane proteins 
(SIMPs), and procaspase 9, binds to Apaf-1 to form 
a complex called an apoptosome. The apoptosome 
determines the activation of caspase 9, an upstream 
initiator  of  apoptosis  (see  Figure  3-16).  Caspase  9 
activates caspase 3 and caspase 7, leading to cell death. 
As you can see, exogenous activators, such as Fas 
ligand  and  Granzyme  B(cid:11)  and  the  endogenous  mi-
tochondrial permeability transition, leading to an 
abrupt release of cytochrome c, are three key triggers 
of apoptosis. However, AIF (for apoptosis-inducing 
factor) is a protein of the intermitochondrial mem-
brane space that can be released into the cytoplasm, 
migrate to the nucleus, bind to DNA, and trigger cell 
destruction without participation of caspases. 

General Pathology: Apoptosis in the immune 
system
Mutations in the Fas receptor, Fas ligand, or caspase 
10 genes can cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative 
syndrome (ALPS). ALPS is characterized by the ac-
cumulation of mature lymphocytes in lymph nodes 
and spleen causing lymphoadenopathy (enlargement 
of lymph nodes) and splenomegaly (enlargement of 
the spleen), and the existence of autoreactive lym-
phocyte clones  producing autoimmune conditions 
such  as  hemolytic  anemia  (caused  by  destruction 
of red blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (reduced 
number of platelets).

General Pathology: Apoptosis in neurodegenerative 
diseases
Neurologic diseases are examples of the mechanism 
of cell death. For example, an ischemic stroke can 
cause an acute neurologic disease in which necrosis 
and activation of caspase 1 are observed. Necrotic cell 
death occurs in the center of the infarction, where the 
damage is severe. Apoptosis may be observed at the 
periphery of the infarction, because the damage is not 
severe due to collateral blood circulation. Pharmaco-

6       The TNFR complex II consists of 
TRADD, FADD, caspase 8 and caspase 
8-inactivated RIPK1 and RIPK3. Inactivation 
of REIPK1 and RIPK3 leads to caspase 
8-dependent execution of apoptosis. FLIP 
forms a heterodimer with caspase 8.

7       The necrosome complex consists of 
PKR-mediated phosphorylated RIPK1 and 
RIPK3, which in turn phosphorylate MLKL. 
The necrosome determines caspase 
8-independent execution of necroptosis. 
Note that necrostatin 1 and 
necrosulfonamide block necroptosis by 
preventing the activity of RIPK1 and MLKL, 
respectively. 

logic treatment with caspase inhibitors can reduce 
tissue damage leading to neurologic improvement.  
Caspase  activation  is  associated  with  the  fatal 
progression of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Hunting-
ton’s disease are two examples. 

ALS  consists  in  the  progressive  loss  of  motor 
neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. A 
mutation in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 
1 (SID1) has been identiﬁed in patients with familial 
ALS.  Activated  caspase  1  and  caspase  3  have  been 
found in spinal cord samples of patients with ALS.

Motor neurons and axons die and reactive microglia 
and astrocytes are present. We come back to ALS in 
Chapter 8, Nervous Tissue.

Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by a move-
ment  disorder  (Huntington’s  chorea). The  disease 
is caused by a mutation in the protein huntingtin. 
Huntingtin  protein  fragments  accumulate  and  ag-
gregate in the neuronal nucleus and transcription of 
the caspase 1 gene is upregulated. Caspase 1 activates 
caspase 3 and both caspases cleave the allelic wild-type 
form of huntingtin, which becomes depleted. As the 
disease progresses, Bid is activated and releases mito-
chondrial cytochrome c. Apoptosomes are assembled  
and further caspase activation leads to neuronal death.

General Pathology: Necroptosis
We learned that apoptosis is a form of programmed 
cell death during development and disease and that 
necrosis is an unregulated process of cell death. How-
ever, necrosis can take place in a regulated manner by 
the molecular mechanism of necroptosis. 

Necroptosis  is  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
ischemic-reperfusion  injury,  stroke,  neurodegen-
eration and viral infection. Therefore, programmed 
necroptosis is a desirable process to be intercepted in 
the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion, neurodegen-
eration, inﬂammatory bowel disease and bacterial and 
viral infection, conditions that display morphologic  
aspects of necrosis. 

It  is  important  to  stress  from  the  start  that  the 
death domain-containing receptor-interacting pro-
tein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as an important 
upstream regulator that exerts a strategic control at 
the crossroad of two important events: cell death and 
inﬂammation. Therefore, RIPK1 is a signiﬁcant and 
useful target for developing new therapies for patho-
logic processes involving inﬂammation and cell death.
Necroptosis can be initiated at the Fas/Fas ligand, 
TNF  receptor  1  (TNFR1),  cell  surface  Toll-like 
receptors  (see  Chapter  10,  Immune-Lymphatic 
System),  and  the  cytoplasmic  viral  RNA  sensor 
DAI  (for  DNA-dependent  activator  of  interferon 
regulatory factors).

As we have seen, Fas/Fas ligand activate the apop-
totic  machinery  involving  initiator  and  execution 
caspases and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. 
The most characterized pathway leading to necrop-
tosis is initiated by TNF ligand binding to TNFR1 
(Figure 17). It can lead to cell survival, apoptosis or 
necroptosis.

Necroptosis involves:
1.  The  activity  of  ubiquitinated  or  deubiquiti-

nated RIPK3.

2. An execution phase involving the necrosome, a 
phosphorylated protein multicomplex that includes 

RIPK1 and RIPK3 in addition to the mixed lineage 
kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein complex. The 
execution phase does not involve caspase 8. In fact 
the function of caspase 8 is inhibited. The outcome 
of necroptosis is the disintegration of mitochondria, 
lysosomes  and  plasma  membrane,  including  the 
production of non-mitochondrial ROS.

Figure  3-17  illustrates  the  different  pathways 
following  binding  of TNFL  to TNFR1.  Note  the 
following:

1. Upstream signaling elements of apoptosis and 
necroptosis  are  shared  and  regulated  in  opposing 
ways.  Note  that  TNFR  complex  I  includes  ubiq-
uitinated  RIPK1,  ubiquitinated  TRAF  (for TNF 
receptor-associated  factors  )  2  and  ubiquitinated 
TRAF 5. Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis  (cIAPs) 
and deubiquitinases are regulatory molecules of the 
TNFR complex I.

2. The TNFR complex I signals through the NF-kB 
activation pathway. It requires ubiquitinated RIPK1 
to  recruit  transforming  growth  factor-(cid:96)  activated 
kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) 
and TAB3.    As  you  realize,  ubiquitin  sequesters 
RIPK1 thereby preventing it from engaging in cell 
death so that cell survival can take place because of 
NF-kB activation. We have already seen details of 
the NF-kB activation pathway and its signiﬁcance in 
immunologic and inﬂammatory signaling. 

3. Deubiquitinated RIPK1 dictates the assembly 
of the TNFR complex II (leading to apoptosis) or 
the necrosome (leading to necroptosis). Essentially, 
deubiquitinated RIPK1 relinquishes its pro-survival 
function and triggers cell death.

4. The TNFR complex II includes RIPK1, RIPK3. 
TRADD (the adapter protein TNFR-associated death 
domain), to link to FADD (the Fas-associated death 
domain protein) that binds to procaspase 8. As you 
recall, procaspase 8 is autocatalytically activated to 
caspase 8 following homodimer formation. Caspase 8 
inactivates RIPK1 and RIPK3 by proteolytic cleavage 
and the caspase-dependent executioner machinery is 
ready for apoptosis.

5. The necrosome is assembled when there is no 
activation or function of caspase 8. The necrosome 
consists  of  phosphorylated  RIPK1,  RIPK3  and 
MLKL by the action of protein kinase R (PKR). 

6. Plasma membrane channels release ROS to pro-
voke swelling of necroptotic cells leading to a break-
down of the plasma membrane. Note that riboﬂavin 
kinase (RFK) links the death domain of TNRF1 to 
p22phox, a subunit of NADPH oxidases, including 
NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), to produce ROS.

7.  Necrostatin  1  prevents  the  deubiquitination 
of RIPK1. Consequently, RIPK1 retaining a polyu-
biquitin  chain  is  not  available  for  organizing  the 
necrosome.  Necrostatin 1 has a protective effect in

experimental  models  of  brain  ischemia.  Necrosul-
fonamide  inhibits  MLKL  and  prevents  the  activ-
ity  of  the  necrosome.  Necroptosis  inhibitors  have 
clinical-therapeutic  relevance  in  transplantation  of 
solid organs by preventing harmful immunologic re-
sponses and reducing proinﬂammatory parenchymal 
responses that may activate rejection.  

8.  Apoptosis  and  necroptosis  may  occur  in  the 

same tissue.

General  Pathology:  Mitochondrial  permeability 
transition
We have previously referred to mitochondrial perme-
ability transition when we discussed the molecular 
biology of cell injury (see Figure 3-12). 

Mitochondrial permeability transition is a process 
that induces regulated cell death necrosis mediated 
by cyclophilin D, a mitochondrial matrix protein. 
Cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant drug widely 
used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection, 
blocks cyclophilin to prevent  mitochondrial perme-
ability transition as a means to reduce inﬂammatory 
responses  and  necroptosis,  thus  improving  graft 
survival  and  protection  from  ischemia-reperfusion 
injury.

Mitochondrial permeability transition occurs by 
the opening of the permeability transition pore. The 
permeability transition pore consists of the voltage-
dependent anion channel (in the outer mitochondrial 
membrane), the adenine-nucleotide translocase (in 
the inner mitochondrial membrane) and cyclophilin 
D (in the mitochondrial matrix).  

A  prolonged  opening  of  permeability  transition 
pores  determines  a  sudden  increase  in  the  perme-
ability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ions 
and  small  molecular  mass  solutes. This  condition 
determines  osmotic  swelling  of  the  mitochondrial 
matrix and breakdown of the outer mitochondrial 
membrane. 

General Pathology: Intracellular degradation
The intracellular degradation of organelles and resid-
ual or misfolded proteins (Figure 3-18) can occur by:

1. The autophagy pathway.
2. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. 
3. The mitophagy signaling pathway.
The autophagy pathway involves the sequestration 
of cytoplasmic components within autophagosomes. 
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway utilizes a catalytic 
multisubunit    structure,  the  26S  proteasome,  that 
recognizes ubiquitinated proteins for degradation.  
The autophagy pathway is a self-degradation and 
cytoprotective  process  involved  in  the  turnover  of 
cytoplasmic organelles as an adaptation to declining 
nutrient resources or  as a form of cell death (when 
the  intensity  and  duration  of  stress  are  excessive). 

Autophagy  and  apoptosis  often  occur  in  the  same 
cell, with autophagy preceding apoptosis. 

The  ubiquitin-proteasome  pathway  pursues  the 
degradation  of  proteins  that  have  already  accom-
plished a speciﬁc function (such as speciﬁc cyclins 
during  the  cell  cycle)  or  proteins  that  have  folded 
incorrectly because of faulty translation or encoded 
by defective genes. As we have seen, the apoptosis 
pathway  is  concerned  with  the  turnover  of  entire 
cells. While apoptosis and the ubiquitin-proteasome 
activities take place in the cytosol, autophagy occurs 
within a sealed compartment, the autophagosomes, 
with the assistance of lysosomes.

The mitophagy signaling pathway eliminates dam-
aged mitochondria to maintain normal cell function. 
Defects  in  mitochondria  function  are  the  cause  of 
reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and speciﬁc neurode-
generative disorders, such as some familial forms of 
Parkinson’s disease. 

 

Autophagy pathway
The process of autophagy starts with, the phagophore, 
a  cytomembrane  derived  from  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum, Golgi or plasma membrane. The phago-
phore expands, surrounds and encloses a cytoplasmic 
components (such as mitochondria, see Figure 3-18) 
that is  captured within a double membrane struc-
ture, the autophagosome. Lysosomes fuse with the 
autophagosome to form an autolysosome (also called 
autophagolysosome) where autophagic degradation 
takes place by the activity of lysosomal acid hydro-
lases. Lysosomal permeases and transporter proteins 
export the breakdown products back to the cytoplasm. 
As  you  can  see,  autophagy  is  a  cellular  cleansing 
and  recycling  pathway.  Progressive  dysfunction  of 
autophagy is likely to lead to aging.

The  autophagy  pathway  includes  the  following 

steps:

1. Cytomembrane selection to become a phago-
some.  Autophagy  starts  with  the  formation  of  a 
membranous  phagophore,  usually  at  endoplasmic 
reticulum-mitochondria  contact  sites  (see  Figure 
3-18).  Multiple  protein  components  participate  in 
the initiation of a phagophore. The ULK1 complex, 
with kinase  activity, triggers mTOR complex (a nega-
tive autophagy regulator), to initiate autophagy by 
selecting a cytomembrane to become a phagophore, 
the precursor of an autophagosome. Then a complex 
of autophagy (Atg) proteins (Atg5-Atg12) conjugate 
and interact with LC3 (protein light chain 3) at the 
phagophore (see Figure 3-18).

2. Formation of an autophagosome. The phago-
phore  double  membrane  extends  and  encloses  at 
random or selectively an organelle or cell component 
for degradation within the autophagosome. Recycling 
of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L and some LC3 takes place.

tophagy regulator. Hypoxia and a decrease in ATP

nutrients and growth factors keeps mTOR’s  cyto-

First, E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, activates 
ubiquitin in the presence of ATP to form a thioester 
bond. Then, E2, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, 
uses the thioester bond to conjugate activated ubiq-
uitin to the target protein. E2 transfers the activated 
ubiquitin to a lysine residue of the substrate with the 
help of E3, a speciﬁc ubiquitin-protein ligase. This 
process is repeated several times to generate a long 
polyubiquitin chain attached to the substrate protein 
destined for degradation in the 26S proteasome.

2. Recognition of the ubiquitin-conjugated protein 
by the 26S proteasome. A protein subunit (designated 
S5a) in the 19S cap of the proteasome acts as a recep-
tor for the polyubiquitin chain.

3. Degradation of the ubiquitin-conjugated pro-
tein into oligopeptides in the 26S barrel, the inner 
proteolytic chamber of the proteasome, in the pres-
ence of ATP.  

4. The release and recycling of ubiquitin. 
The 26S proteasome is a giant (~2000 kd) multi-
meric protease present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. 
Structurally, the 26S proteasome consists of a barrel-
shaped core capped by two structures that recognize 
ubiquitinated proteins. Protein degradation occurs 
within a chamber of the barrel-shaped core. As we 
have indicated, proteins degraded by the 26S protea-
some include proteins involved in the regulation of 
the cell cycle (cyclins), transcription factors, and the 
processing of antigens involved in the activation of 
inﬂammatory and immune responses.

Mitophagy signaling pathway 
The mitophagy signaling pathway pursues the dis-
posal  of  damaged  mitochondria  and  involves  two 
enzymes (see Figure 3-18):

General Pathology: Neoplasia 
Neoplasia means poorly regulated new cell growth 
(Greek neos, new; plasma, things formed) and the term 
is interchangeable with tumor  (Latin tumor, swell-
ing). Cancer (Latin, a crab) is a malignant neoplasm 
or malignant tumor. The cells of origin derive from 
the  three  embryonic  layers  (ectoderm,  mesoderm 
and endoderm)

Two types of tumors are considered from a clinical 
perspective: benign tumors and malignant tumors. 
A benign tumor is characterized by localized active 
growth and results in the development of a cellular 
mass, or tumor, with similar structural, and some-
times,  functional  features  resembling  the  cells  of 
origin. 

Benign  neoplasms  or  benign  tumors  are  for  the 
most  part  encapsulated,  grow  slowly  and  do  not 
spread at a distance by invading blood or lymphatic 
vessels. However, benign tumors can compress adja-
cent tissues (for example, compression of the urethra 
by a prostatic benign tumor or a benign tumor of the 
brain stem). A benign tumor can grow in the lumen 
of an organ (for example, the intestine) and cause an 
obstruction.

A malignant tumor can be differentiated, resem-
bling the tissue of origin, poorly differentiated, by 
retaining some of the characteristics of the tissue of 
origin, and undifferentiated or anaplastic, when the 
cell or tissue origin cannot be identiﬁed. 

Tumor  staging  system  (TNM:  tumors/nodes/
metastases) is based on three parameters (Cuthbert 
Dukes [1890-1977] staging for colorectal cancer):

1. The size of the tumor and the degree of local 

2. PINK1, a protein kinase, associated with the

outer mitochondrial membrane.

In  response  to  mitochondrial  damage,  PINK1 

recruits and activates parkin.

Activated parkin exerts its ubiquitin ligase activity 
by  transferring  polyubiquitin  to  proteins  attached 
to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Ubiquitin-
tagged proteins are recognized by the proteasomal 
proteolytic  machinery  to  initiate  mitochondrial 
degradation.

Note  that  the  goal  of  the  parkin-PINK1  com-
plex  is  to  eliminate  defective  mitochondria.  If  the 
parkin-PINK1  complex  is  defective,  dysfunctional 
mitochondrial  are  not  cleared  and  cell  function  is 
compromised. Parkinson’s disease is an example of a 
neurodegenerative disease caused by mitochondrial 
dysfunction determined by mutations in the ubiqui-
tin ligase parkin and protein kinase PINK1. 

Also note the clear difference of the lysosomal–

2. The involvement of regional lymph nodes (N).
3. The presence of metastasis (M).
For example, T1, N0, M0 signiﬁes small tumor, 
no  regional  lymph  node  involved  and  absence  of 
metastases. 

Most carcinomas (Greek karkinoma, cancer; oma, 
tumor) are malignant neoplasms of epithelial cell ori-
gin (ectoderm and endoderm). An adenocarcinoma 
is  a malignant tumor resembling glandular pattern. 
Sarcomas (Greek sarkoma, ﬂeshly excrescence; oma, 
tumor)  are  malignant  neoplasms  of  mesenchyme 
(mesoderm) origin (Figure 3-19).

In general, carcinomas develop from a dysplasia 
(Greek dys, difﬁcult; plasis, a molding), a process that 
involves genetic alterations and the participation of 
diverse cellular signaling pathways (see Box 3-D).

Dysplasia occurs in epithelial tissues. It is deﬁned by 
an increase in the rate of mitosis, lack of complete cell

• p53:  Inactivation of this tumor suppressor protein, a transcription factor 
expressed in response to DNA damage (see Chapter 1, Epithelium), is associ-
ated with 50% to 60% of human cancers. Inactive p53 enables the progression 
through the cell cycle of cells containing damaged DNA. 

differentiation and abnormal cell-cell relationships. 
Dysplasia can progress into carcinoma in situ and 
then to invasive tumor.

Carcinoma in situ is restricted to an epithelial layer 
without breaking through the basement membrane 
to reach the subjacent connective tissue. Carcinomas 
in situ are usually found in the uterine cervix, skin, 
and breast, localized in the lactiferous ducts (intra-
ductal carcinoma) or in the mammary lobular tissue 
(intralobular carcinoma).  

Neoplastic adenomatous polyps have similar fea-
tures of carcinoma in situ and are precursors of carci-
nomas in some organs such as colon (see Chapter 16, 
Lower Digestive Segment). A polyp grows outwards 
from an epithelial surface, representing a neoplasm 
(adenoma) or an inﬂammatory process.

In addition to local invasion, carcinoma cells spread 
through lymphatic vessels, giving rise to metastases 
in lymph nodes. Some carcinoma cells invade blood 
vessels  to  produce  hematogenous  metastases.  Me-
tastasis (Greek meta, on the midst of; stasis, placing), 
or secondary tumors, originate from cells detached 
from a primary tumor.

Sarcomas  originate  in  mesenchyme-derived  soft 
tissues, are locally invasive and spread predominantly 
through blood vessels. Sarcomas progenitor cells are 
not restricted by a basement membrane like epithe-
lial  cell  progenitors.  Sarcomas  consist  of  fusiform 
cells, whereas carcinomas tend to retain an epithelial 
conﬁguration  stabilized  by  cell  junctions  and  cell 
adhesion molecules.

Note in Figure 3-19 the designation of benign and 

malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin. 

Figure 3-19 also shows the designation of a number 
of tumors that do not conform with the carcinoma 
and sarcoma designation. They are named on the basis 
of their cell or tissue origin:

1. Lymphomas, when they originate in the lym-

3. Leukemias (Greek leukos, white; haima, blood), 
when the malignancy develops from multipotential 
stem cells or committed progenitor cells and spreads 
through the body after crossing endothelial cell bar-
riers.  Hematopoietic  neoplasms  can    arise  from  a 
preceding myelodysplasia, an equivalent to epithelial 
dysplasia.

4. Teratoma, when benign or malignant tumoral 
cells derive from the three embryological layers (ec-
toderm,  mesoderm  and  endoderm),  the  male  and 
female gonads or non-gonadal sites. 

5. Hamartomas, when developmental abnormali-
ties (such as  hemangiomas) produce tumoral masses 
in a normal site (skin).

6. Choristomas, when tissue overgrowth takes place 
in an aberrant site and mimics a tumor. Choristomas 
can be localized in the head and neck region (pharynx, 
oral cavity and middle ear). Several different tissue 
types  can  occur  in  the  oral  cavity  as  choristomas 
(cartilage, bone, glial tissue and thyroid tissue).

In  addition,  a  number  of  tumors  are  identiﬁed 
by the name of the discoverer (see Figure 3-19). For 
example,  Ewing’s  sarcoma,  a  bone  tumor  highly 
sensitive to radiation therapy that affects children and 
young adults, belongs to the group of  Ewing’s Sar-

 Box 3-H  |  Proto-oncogenes and oncogenes

• A proto-oncogene is a normal gene encoding a regulatory protein of the cell 
cycle, cell differentiation, or a cell-signaling pathway. Proto-oncogenic proteins 
mimic growth factors, hormone receptors, G proteins, intracellular enzymes, and 
transcription factors.
• An oncogene is a mutated proto-oncogene that encodes an oncoprotein 
able to disrupt the normal cell cycle and to cause cancer.
• Proto-oncogenes and oncogene are designated by an italicized three-letter 
name. An oncogene present in a virus has the preﬁx v. A proto-oncogene pres-
ent in a cell has the preﬁx c.
•  A protein encoded by a proto-oncogene or oncogene has the same three-
letter designation as the proto-oncogene or oncogene; however, the letters are 
not italicized and the ﬁrst letter is capitalized.
• Anti-oncogenes are also called  tumor suppressor genes. Uncontrolled  
activity of a tumor suppressor gene product results in constitutive activation of 
cell growth (uncontrolled cell division), leading to cancer.

coma Family of Tumor (ESFT). ESFT is characterized 
by a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, 
t(11;22) of a gene in chromosome 22, that encodes 
the Ewing sarcoma gene (EWS), and the transcription 
factor  encoding  gene  FLI1  from  chromosome  11. 
The result is a new fused gene, EWA/FLI, encoding 
an abnormal protein. 

Burkitt’s lymphoma is described in Box 3-G. De-
tails on Hodgkin’s disease or lymphoma are included 
in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System. Kaposi’s 
sarcoma  (a  tumor  originated  in  endothelial  cells 
caused by human herpesvirus 8 [HHV8], also known 
as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]) 
is discussed in Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System.

General Pathology: Proto-oncogenes, oncogenes, 
and tumor suppressor genes
Mutations of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes lead to cancer. The mutated version of a proto-
oncogene (Greek prõtos, ﬁrst; genos, birth) (see Box 
3-H) is called oncogene (Greek onkos, bulk, mass).  
Mutations  of  proto-oncogenes  are  dominant 
because the mutation of a single allele can lead to 
cellular  transformation.  In  contrast,  the  mutation 
of a tumor suppressor gene is recessive: both alleles 
of a tumor suppressor gene must be mutated for cell 
transformation to take place. 

Oncogenes express constantly active products lead-
ing to unregulated cell growth and differentiation, 
the two properties of cancer cells.  A cell becomes 
transformed  when  it  changes  from  regulated  to 
unregulated growth. 

Mutations can be in the gene sequence (point mu-
tations, deletions, insertions or gene ampliﬁcation) 
or by chromosomal translocation or chromosomal 
fusion (by placing a gene in a different regulatory 
environment). Note that the terms proto-oncogenes 
and oncogenes are not interchangeable. 

Figure 3-20 integrates the six major categories of 

oncogene products within the oncogene functional 
pathway.  

Oncogene genes are involved in several regulatory 

functions as (Figure 3-21):  

1. Growth factors.
2. Growth factor receptors.
3. Signal transduction molecules.
4. Transcription factors. 
5. Other factors.
1.  Growth  factors:    Oncogene-derived  proteins 
are capable to induce the abnormal proliferation of 
nearby cells (paracrine), distant cells (endocrine) or 
their own (autocrine). Examples are platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF) released from platelets dur-
ing coagulation and the Wingless family of  secreted 
glycoproteins (see Box 3-D) 

2.  Growth  factor  receptors  (receptor  tyrosine 
kinases):  As  we  have  already  seen  earlier  in  this 
chapter,  tyrosine  kinases  add  phosphate  groups  to 
tyrosine residues in target proteins to switch them on 
or off. When a cell surface receptor is constitutively 
tyrosine phosphorylated (in the absence of a ligand), 
it transmits signals inside the cell leading to cancer. 
Examples are the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR),  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor 
(PDGFR),  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  re-
ceptor (VEGFR), human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2), and c-kit receptor (involved in 
the migration of mast cells to the connective tissue 
and the colonization of the gonadal ridges by primor-
dial germ cells during development).

3. Signal transducer molecules, including:  
Cytoplasmic  tyrosine  kinases.  Examples  of  in-
tracellular  oncogenes  with  tyrosine  kinase  activity  
include the c-abl gene in chronic myeloid leukemia 
and the Src family (see Box 3-G). 

Cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases. Examples 
include  Raf  kinase,  that  activates  a  second  kinase, 
MEK (see The Ras, Raf and MAP kinase pathway) 
and cyclin-dependent kinases, discussed in Chapter 
1, Epithelium,in our discussion of the cell cycle.

Regulatory  GTPases.  An  example  is  the  Ras 
protein, a membrane associated GTP binding/GTP 
ase. After interacting with Raf cytoplasmic protein 
serine kinase, Ras breaks down GTP into GDP and 
a phosphate following activation by the ligands EGF 
or TGF-(cid:96). Ras protein, acting as an on/off switch in 
major signaling pathways, stimulates cell growth and 
proliferation.

4.  Transcription  factors:  Oncogenes  coding  for 
sequence-speciﬁc  DNA  binding  proteins  include 
myb (for avian myeloblastosis virus) and ets (for E26 
transformation speciﬁc). An example for transcription 
factor is the c-myc gene, that regulates the transcrip-
tion of genes inducing cell proliferation.

The c-myc gene is an example of proto-oncogene 
activation by chromosomal translocation. The c-myc 
gene is translocated to one of the immunoglobulin 
loci in Burkitt’s lymphomas (see Box 3-G). The c-myc 
gene is a target of the APC/(cid:96)-catenin/Tcf pathway in 
colon carcinoma cells (see Chapter 16, Lower Diges-
tive Segment). 

5.  Other  factors,  inluding  the  activation  of  the 
oncogene  Bcl-2,  associated  with  mitochondrial 
membranes, can block apoptosis, as we have already 
discussed; the APC gene, a negative regulator of (cid:96)-
catenin signaling in Adenomatous polyposis coli, and 
others (see Figure 3-21). 

Tumor suppressor genes encode proteins that un-

der normal conditions prevent the development of 
tumors. In general, they inhibit the cell cycle. When 
this inhibitory function is lost because of a mutation 
of a tumor suppressor gene, a condition known as 
loss-of-function  mutations,  cancer  development 
occurs.  As  indicated  above,  a  mutation  in  tumor 
suppressor genes is recessive because inactivation of 
both alleles is required in an individual cell. 

Tumor suppressor genes include the p53 gene the 
retinoblastoma  (Rb) gene (see Chapter 1, Epithe-
lium). Their function is to regulate the cell cycle.

An  additional  group  includes  the  BRCA1  and 
BRCA2  genes,  tumor  suppressor  genes  associated 
with breast and ovarian cancer. Their function is to 
maintain DNA integrity. 

The gene products encoded by the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2  genes  are  nuclear  proteins  that  co-localize 
with RAD-51 at sites of DNA damage and participate 
in  homologous  recombination  repair  of  double-
stranded breaks. 

A loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene function encodes 
defective protein products resulting in the accumu-
lation of genetic defects that can lead to cancer. We 
come back to the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 
breast cancer in Chapter 23, Fertilization, Placenta-
tion, and Lactation.  

Identiﬁcation of oncogenes in retroviruses
Although most animal viruses destroy the cells they 
infect, several types of viruses are able to establish a 
long-term infection, in which the cell is not killed. 
This  stable  virus–host  cell  interaction  perpetuates 
the  viral  information  in  the  cell,  usually  by  direct 
insertion into cellular DNA. 

The ﬁrst oncogenes to be identiﬁed came from the 
study of retroviruses. All vertebrate animals, includ-
ing humans, inherit genes related to retroviral genes 
and transmit them to their progeny. These are called 
endogenous proviruses, whereas those that infect a 
cell are called exogenous proviruses. 

Cancer viruses isolated from every type of verte-
brate  animal  induce  a  wide  variety  of  tumors  and 
belong to several virus types: RNA-containing tumor 
viruses,  called  retroviruses,  and  DNA-containing 
tumor  viruses,  including  the  polyomaviruses,  the 
papillomaviruses,  the  adenoviruses,  and  the  her-
pesviruses.

RNA-containing retroviruses have a distinct cell 
cycle. In the initial stages of infection, the viral RNA 
is copied into DNA by the viral enzyme reverse tran-

scriptase. Once synthesized, the viral DNA molecule 
is transported into the nucleus and inserted randomly 
as a provirus at any one of the available sites of host 
chromosomal DNA. Proviruses contain signals for the 
regulation of their own viral genes, but such signals 
can  be  transmitted  to  the  proto-oncogene,  forcing 
it to produce larger than normal amounts of RNA 
and a protein. 

Retroviruses  and  polyomaviruses  have  received 
the  most  attention  because  they  carry  one  or  two 
genes that have speciﬁc cancer-inducing properties: 
so-called viral oncogenes. Retroviruses and polyoma-
viruses like cellular genes, are subject to mutations. 
A  group  of  such  mutants  of  Rous  sarcoma  virus 
(RSV; species of origin: chicken) has proved useful 
for determining the role of the viral gene v-src. The 
src-like sequences in normal cells constitute a cellular 
gene called c-src, a proto-oncogene.

The viral src derives directly from the cellular src. 
A precursor of RSV seems to have acquired a copy 
of  c-src  during  infection  of  a  chicken  cell.  c-src  is 
harmless but its close relative, v-src, causes tumors 
and transform cells after RSV infection. A chicken 
ﬁbroblast produces about 50 times more src RNA 
and protein than an uninfected ﬁbroblast contain-
ing only the c-src gene. The c-src gene assumed great 
signiﬁcance when it was recognized that many other 
retroviruses carry oncogenes, often different from v-
src. Each of these genes is also derived from a distinct, 
normal cellular precursor.

The classiﬁcation of genes as proto-oncogenes is 
based  on  the  understanding  that  mutant  forms  of 
these genes participate in the development of cancer 
(see Box 3-G). However, proto-oncogenes serve dif-
ferent biochemical functions in the control of normal 
growth and development.

RSV-infected cells produce a 60-kd protein. This 
protein was identiﬁed as the product that the v-src 
gene uses to transform cells. It was named p60v-src.   
This protein can function as a protein kinase and, 
within  a  living    cell,  many  proteins  can  be  phos-
phorylated  by  Src  kinase  activity. The  target  for 
phosphorylation is tyrosine residues.

Cell transformation by the v-src oncogene causes a 
tenfold increase in total cellular phosphotyrosine in 
cellular target proteins restricted to the inner side of 
the cell membrane. Many other proteins encoded by 
proto-oncogenes or involved in control of cell growth 
function like the Src protein, such as protein kinases, 
are often speciﬁc for tyrosine.

Essential concepts

Cell Signaling

• Cell signaling is the mechanism by which 
cells respond to chemical signals. Signaling 
molecules are either secreted or expressed 
on the cell surface of cells. When a signaling 
molecule binds to its receptor, it initiates intra-
cellular reactions to regulate cell proliferation, 
differentiation, cell movements, metabolism, 
and behavior.

• There are several cell signaling mechanisms:
  (1) Endocrine signaling involves a hormone 
secreted by an endocrine cell and transported 
through blood circulation to act on a distant 
target. 
  (2) Paracrine signaling is mediated by mol-
ecules acting locally to regulate the function of 
a neighboring cell. 
  (3) Autocrine signaling consists in cells 
responding to signaling molecules that are 
produced by themselves. 
  (4) Neurotransmitter signaling is a speciﬁc 
form of paracrine signaling involving neurons 
and neurotransmitter molecules released at a 
synapse. 
  (5) Neuroendocrine signaling consists in a 
neuroendocrine cell releasing a hormone into 
the bloodstream in response to a stimulus 
released from an axon terminal.    
   Cell signaling requires negative or positive 
feedback action to regulate the release of the 
targeting hormone or ligand.

• Hormones or ligands can be: 
  (1) Steroid hormones (for example, 
cholesterol-derived testosterone, estrogen, 
progesterone, and corticosteroids). 
  (2) Peptide hormones (for example, insulin, 
neuropeptides secreted by neurons, and 

growth factors). Steroid hormones bind to 
cytosol and nuclear receptors. Nonsteroid 
signaling molecules, such as thyroid hormone, 
vitamin D3, and retinoids (vitamin A), bind to 
intracellular receptors.
Peptide hormones and growth factors bind to 
a cell surface receptor.    
  Several speciﬁc signaling molecules exist:
  (1) Epinephrine can be a neurotransmit-
ter and also a hormone released into the 
bloodstream. 
  (2) Eicosanoids and leukotrienes (derived 
from arachidonic acid) are lipid-containing 
signaling molecules, which bind to cell surface 
receptors.  

• Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule of very 
short half-life (seconds). Nitric oxide is synthe-
sized from arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide 
synthase. Nitric oxide can diffuse across the 
plasma membrane but it does not bind to a 
receptor. Its major function is the regulation of 
the activity of intracellular enzymes. One of the 
relevant functions of nitric oxide is the dilation 
of blood vessels. Nitroglycerin, an agent used 
in the treatment of heart disease, is converted 
to nitric oxide, which increases heart blood 
ﬂow by dilation of the coronary artery.

• After binding to a cell surface receptor, pep-
tide hormones or growth factors activate intra-
cellular targets downstream of the receptor. 
  (1) G protein–coupled receptors consist of 
three subunits ((cid:95)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:96)(cid:3)and (cid:97)) forming a complex. 
The (cid:95) subunit binds GDP (guanosine diphos-
phate) and regulates G protein activity. When a 
signaling molecule binds to its receptor, the (cid:95)(cid:3)
subunit of the associated G protein dissoci-

ates, releases GDP, and binds GTP (guanosine 
triphosphate) to activate an adjacent target 
molecule.
  (2) Tyrosine kinases can be a transmem-
brane protein or present in the cytosol. The 
ﬁrst form is called tyrosine kinase receptor; 
the second form is known as  nonreceptor 
tyrosine kinase. Binding of a ligand to tyrosine 
kinase receptor produces its dimerization 
resulting in autophosphorylation of the 
intracellular domain. Downstream molecules 
with SH2 (Src homology 2) domains bind to 
the catalytic kinase domain of tyrosine kinase 
receptor. The activity of tyrosine kinase recep-
tor  can be disrupted by inducing unregulated 
autophosphorylation in the absence of a 
ligand. Tyrosine kinase activity can be inhibited 
by imatinib mesylate, a molecule with bind-
ing afﬁnity to the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP)-binding domain of the catalytic domain. 
Imatinib is used in the treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, and mast 
cell leukemias.
  (3) Cytokine receptors are a family of recep-
tors that stimulate intracellular protein tyrosine 
kinases, which are not intrinsic components of 
the receptor. Ligand binding to cytokine recep-
tors triggers receptor dimerization and cross-
phosphorylation of the associated  tyrosine 
kinases. Members of the cytokine receptor–
associated tyrosine kinase family are the Src 
family and the Janus kinase family (JAK). 
  (4) Receptors can be linked to enzymes 
such as protein tyrosine phosphatases 
and protein serine and threonine kinases.  
Tyrosine phosphatases remove tyrosine 
phosphate groups from phosphotyrosine and

arrest signaling started by tyrosine phosphory-

factor-(cid:96)(cid:3)(TGF-(cid:96)) family are protein kinases that 
phosphorylate serine and threonine residues. 
Ligand binding to TGF-(cid:96) induces receptor 
dimerization and the serine- or threonine-

cross-phosphorylates the polypeptide chains of 
the receptor.

• Following ligand binding, most receptors 
activate intracellular enzymes to transmit and 
amplify a signal.
  (1) The cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate) pathway results from the formation 
of cAMP (known as a second messenger) 
from ATP by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. The 
intracellular effects of cAMP are mediated by 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (also known 
as protein kinase A). Inactive cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase is a tetramer composed of two 
regulatory subunits (the binding site of cAMP) 
and two catalytic subunits. The enzyme phos-
phodiesterase degrades cAMP. Upon cAMP 
binding, the catalytic subunits dissociate and 
each catalytic subunit phosphorylates serine 
residues on target proteins or migrates to the 
cell nucleus.
  In the cell nucleus, the catalytic subunit 
phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB 
(CRE-binding protein) bound to CRE (the 
cAMP response element), and speciﬁc gene 
activity is induced.  
  (2) The cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophos-
phate) pathway uses guanylate cyclase to 
produce cGMP, which is degraded by a cGMP-
dependent phosphodiesterase. Photoreceptors 
of the retina use cGMP to convert light signals 
to nerve impulses.
  (3) The phospholipase C–Ca2+ pathway con-
sists in the production of second messengers 
from the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 
4.5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Hydrolysis of PIP2 
by phospholipase C (PLC) produces two 
second messengers: diacylglycerol and inositol 
1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). Diacylglycerol and 
IP3 stimulate protein kinase C (protein serine 
and threonine kinases) and the mobilization of 
Ca2+. Protein kinase C activates protein kinases 
of the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase 
pathway to phosphorylate transcription factors.
  (4) The Ca2+-calmodulin pathway consists in 
the activation of calmodulin, a Ca2+-dependent 
protein, when Ca2+ concentration increases 
and binds to calmodulin. You should note that 
the phospholipase C–Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmod-
ulin pathway regulates Ca2+ concentration by 
Ca2+ release from intracellular storage as well 
as entry into the cell from the extracellular 
space. 
  (5) The MAP kinase pathway involves serine 
and threonine MAP kinases. The extracellular 
signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family is a MAP 
kinase acting through either tyrosine kinase or 
G protein–associated receptors. The activation 
of ERK is mediated by two protein kinases: 
Raf and MEK (MAP kinase or ERK kinase). Raf 
interacts with rat sarcoma virus (Ras) protein, 
a key element of the group of oncogenic 
proteins. 

   Raf phosphorylates  MEK which activates 
ERK, and then phosphorylated ERK activates 
nuclear (Elk-1) and cytosolic target proteins. 
Two other MAP kinases are JNK and p38 MAP 
kinases.
  (6) The JAK-STAT pathway regulates transcrip-
tion factors. Signal transducer and activators of 
transcription (STAT) proteins are transcription 
factors with an SH2 domain and present in the 
cytoplasm in an inactive state. Ligand binding 
to a cytokine receptor determines the attach-
ment of STAT to the receptor associated Janus 
kinase (JAK), a tyrosine kinase, through their 
SH2 domain. Phosphorylated STAT dimerizes 
and translocates to the cell nucleus to activate 
gene transcription.
  (7) The NF-(cid:103)B (for nuclear factor involved in 
the transcription of the (cid:103) light chain gene in B 
lymphocytes) transcription factor pathway is 
stimulated by protein kinase C and is involved 
in immune responses. When inactive, the 
NF-(cid:103)B heterodimer is bound to the inhibitory 
subunit I-(cid:103)B and remains in the cytoplasm. 
Phosphorylation of I-(cid:103)B, triggered by I-(cid:103)B 
kinase, results in the destruction of I-(cid:103)B by the 
26S proteasome and the nuclear translocation 
of the NF-(cid:103)B heterodimer to activate gene 
transcription.
  (8) The integrin-actin pathway transmits 
outside-in mechanical and chemical signals 
initiated in the extracellular matrix to the cell 
interior mediated by intermediary proteins link-
ing actin to integrin heterodimers.
  
• There are speciﬁc signaling pathways with 
roles in embryonic and fetal development, 
body axis patterning, cell migration and cell 
proliferation. They include: 
  (1) Hedgehog (HH) signaling. 
  (2) Wingless (Wnt)/(cid:96)-catenin signaling.  
  (3) Notch signaling; (4) Transforming growth 
factor-(cid:96) (TGF-(cid:96)) signaling. 
  (5) Bone morphogenetic protein signaling, a 
member of the TGF-(cid:96) superfamily. 
  (6) Fibroblast growth factor signaling.
   All of them utilize diverse regulatory steps 
and crosstalk mechanisms, including transcrip-
tion factors that translocate from the cytoplasm 
to the nucleus. 

• Stem cells have three properties: 
  (1) Self-renewal.
  (2) Proliferation.
  (3) Differentiation. 
  Stem cells, housed in a distinct microenviron-
ment called stem cell niche,  can give rise to 
cell precursors that generate tissues of the 
body. 
  The functional state of stem cells is governed 
by stemness. Stemness is the characteristic 
gene expression proﬁle of different stem cells 
not observed in ordinary, non-stem cells.  
   Stem cells are present in the intestinal 
epithelium, the epidermis of the skin, the 
hematopoietic tissue, and spermatogenic cells. 

• Human pluripotent cells and cell replace-
ment therapies are the pursuit of regenerative 
medicine. 
  Three cell reprogramming methods have 

been used to produce pluripotent embryonic 
stem cells: 
  (1) Induced programmed stem cells (iPS) 
using a transcription factor cocktail. 
  (2) Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), 
or cloning, to produce genetically matched 
nuclear transfer embryonic cells (NT ES) re-
moved from the inner cell mass of embryos.
  (3) Blastocysts from the inner cell mass of 
embryos derived from in vitro fertilization (un-
programmed embryonic stem cells, IVF ES). 
   IVF ES exhibit properties close to the intact 
blastocysts but they are allogenic (they exhibit 
properties close to the intact blastocysts but 
are genetically different and potentially 
incompatible when transplanted).  NT ES are 
epigenetically stable (like IVF ES) and histo-
compatible (like iPS).

• Cell culture procedures demonstrate that: 
  (1) Cells stop growing when they cover 
entirely the surface of a culture dish. This is 
called density-dependent inhibition of growth. 
  (2) Cultured cells can continue growing until 
they stop dividing. The cells have become 
senescent. 
  (3) Tumor cells can become immortal and 
their growth in culture is endless. Such cells 
can establish a cell line. 
  (4) Transformed cells have a malignant 
growth potential and exhibit anchorage-
independent growth. In contrast, normal cells 
grow attached to a substrate.

• Aging is the gradual decline over time in 
cell and tissue function that often, not always, 
decreases the  longevity of an individual. 
Cellular senescence speciﬁes the molecular 
aspects of loss of function of mitotic cells dur-
ing aging. For example, telomerases maintain 
the end of the chromosomes, the telomeres. 
Insufﬁcient telomerase activity forces cells into 
senescence. Telomere shortening is a potent 
tumor suppressor mechanism. Most tumor 
express human telomerase reverse transcrip-
tase (hTERT) and the growth of their cells in 
culture is endless.  

• Cell injury consists in a number of biochemi-
cal and morphologic changes resulting from 
exogenous or endogenous causes leading to 
a reversible or irreversible disruption of nor-
mal cell function. Hypoxia (a decrease in the 
supply of oxygen) or anoxia (a complete block 
in oxygen supply) trigger cell injury. Ischemia 
is a major cause of cell injury. Complete isch-
emia by blockage of an arterial branch of the 
coronary artery causes infarction of the cardiac 
muscle supplied by that blood vessel. If the 
occluded blood vessel is reopened soon after 
ischemic injury (by angioplasty and throm-
bolysis), injured cardiocytes may recover by 
reperfusion.

• Oxygen is essential for oxidative phophoryla-
tion involved in ATP production by mitochon-
dria. Increased mitochondrial permeability is 
a typical feature of mitochondrial damage. 
Impaired mitochondrial function results in 
a decrease in ATP production, increase of

reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide, 
hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) and 
leakage of cytochrome c (the trigger of the 
intrinsic apoptosis pathway).  ATP deﬁciency 
affects the function of ATP-dependent pumps 
at the plasma membrane, resulting in a 
signiﬁcantly unregulated  inﬂux of calcium, 
sodium and water and an efﬂux of potassium. 
Excess of intracellular calcium, together with a 
leakage of lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes (due 
to lysosomal membrane permeability), activate 
cytosolic enzymes, which degrade cell compo-
nents and continue enhancing mitochondrial 
permeability.
  Depending on the type and time of injury 
and the characteristics of an injured cell, injury 
can be reversible or irreversible. 
  Irreversible cell injury determines cell death 
by necrosis (unregulated process of cell death) 
or apoptosis (regulated process of cell death). 
   Necrosis can be recognized by microscopic 
and macroscopic changes. Microscopic chang-
es include a breakdown of cell membranes, 
cell swelling and nuclear changes (pyknosis, 
karyolysis, and karyorrhexis). 
  Macroscopic changes include:
  (1) Coagulative necrosis. 
  (2) Liquefactive necrosis. 
  (3) Caseous necrosis.
  (4) Fat necrosis. 
  Fibrinoid necrosis of the wall of blood vessels 
can be detected microscopically.

• Apoptosis or programmed cell death can be 
determined by external and internal signals. 
Two extrinsic pathways are:
  (1) The granzyme B/perforin pathway.
  (2) The Fas receptor/Fas ligand pathway. 
  The intrinsic pathway consists  in the leakage 
of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. 
  The end point of all three pathways is the 
activation of procaspases to caspases, the 
initiators and executors of cell death. 
   A defect in the activity of Fas receptor, Fas 
ligand, and caspases can cause the  autoim-

mune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), 
characterized by the abnormal and excessive 
accumulation of lymphocytes in the lymph 
nodes and spleen. 
  Aberrant activation of caspases is associ-
ated with neurodegenerative disease, such 
as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
Huntington’s disease.

• Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis 
involving a molecular mechanism distinct from 
necrosis and apoptosis. Necrotic cell death 
is dependent on receptor-interacting protein 
kinase 3 (RIPK3). 
  Necroptosis has pathophysiologic relevance 
in myocardial infarction and stroke, atheroscle-
rosis, ischemia–reperfusion injury, pancreatitis, 
and inﬂammatory bowel diseases.

  Two signiﬁcant differences are: 
  (1) Necroptosis has inﬂammation as an alter-
native to necrotic cell death through the NF-(cid:103)B 
activation pathway.
  (2) Necrotic cell death can take place by 
either a caspase-dependent mechanism 
(apoptosis) or caspase-independent mecha-
nism (necroptosis).

• The proteolysis of residual and misfolded 
proteins or the disposal of aged organelles, like 
mitochondria, can occur by: 
  (1) The autophagy pathway, starting with 
a phagophore sourrounding and enclosing 
the disposable organelle to be degraded by 
lysosomes. 
  (2) The ubiquitin–26S proteasome pathway 
requires the attachment of a polyubiquitin 
chain to proteins marked for degradation by 
the ~2000-kd 26S proteasome protease. 
  (3) The mitophagy signaling pathway, 
concerned with the disposal of defective or 
non-functional mitochondria utilizing parkin, a 
ubiquitin ligase, and PINK1, a protein kinase. 
The ﬁnal elimination step of the polyubiquiti-
nated target involves the 26S proteasome.

• Neoplasia (tumor) can be: 
  (1) Benign or malignant. 
  (2) Epithelial or non-epithelial (mesen-
chyma)–derived. 
  Benign epithelial tumors include papillomas 
and adenomatous polyps. 
  Malignant epithelial tumors are called carci-
nomas (epithelial-type) or adenocarcinomas 
(glandular-type). 
  Sarcomas are mesenchyme-derived tumors. 
Review the terminology using Figure 3-19.
  Carcinomas can spreads by local invasion 
or through lymphatic vessels, giving rise to 
metastases in lymph nodes. 
  Sarcomas usually spread by hematogenous 
metastases (predominantly through blood 
vessels).  

• Proto-oncogenes express growth factors, 
growth factor receptors, signal transduction 
molecules, nuclear transcription factors and 
other factors. An oncogene results from the 
mutation of a proto-oncogene. Oncogenes 
determine unregulated cell growth and a cell 
then becomes transformed. 
   Tumor suppressor genes encode proteins 
that under normal conditions prevent the 
development of tumors by inhibiting the po-
tentially malignant cell cycle. Cancer develops 
when this inhibitory function is not present 
(loss-of-function).
  The ﬁrst oncogenes to be identiﬁed were 
the retroviruses (RNA-containing viruses) with 
cancer-inducing properties (viral oncogenes).
  DNA-containing viruses (polyomaviruses, 
the papillomaviruses, the adenoviruses, and 
the herpesviruses) can induce tumors.
  The chicken cell Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) 
includes the viral gene v-src. The proto-onco-
gene equivalent in normal cells is c-src. The 
v-src gene encodes the protein p60v-src, which 
functions as a tyrosine protein kinase. 
  Cell transformation by the v-src oncogene 
results in a signiﬁcant increase in total cell 
phosphotyrosine.

4. Connective Tissue 

The connective tissue provides the supportive and connecting framework (or stroma) for all the other tissues 
of  the  body.  The  connective  tissue  is  formed  by  cells,  ﬁbers  and  the  extracellular  matrix  (ECM).  The  ECM 
(ground substance) represents a combination of collagens, noncollagenous glycoproteins, and proteoglycans 
surrounding the cells of connective tissue. The resident cell of the connective tissue is the ﬁbroblast. Immigrant 
cells to the connective tissue include macrophages, mast cells, and plasma cells. The connective tissue has 
important roles in immune and inﬂammatory responses, and tissue repair after injury. 

Classiﬁcation
Unlike  epithelial  cells,  which  are  almost  free  of 
intercellular  material,  connective  tissue  cells  are 
widely  separated  by  components  of  the  ECM. 
In  addition,  epithelial  cells  lack  direct  blood  and 
lymphatic  supply,  whereas  connective  tissue  is 
directly  supplied  by  blood  and  lymphatic  vessels 
and nerves. 

The  classiﬁcation  of  the  connective  tissue  into 
speciﬁc types is based on the proportion of three of 
its components: cells, ﬁbers, and ECM. 

Connective  tissue  can  be  classiﬁed  into  three 

major groups: 

1. Embryonic connective tissue (or mesenchyme, 

Figure 4-1).

2. Adult connective tissue (Figure 4-1).
3. Special connective tissue (Figure 4-2).
Embryonic  connective  tissue  derives  from  the 
mesoderm  during  early  embryonic  development. 
This  type  of  connective  tissue,  found  primarily 
in  the  umbilical  cord,  consists  predominantly  of 
stellate-shaped  mesenchymal  cells  producing  a 
hydrophilic  ECM  with  a  jelly-like  consistency. 
Because of this consistency, it is also called mucoid 
connective tissue or Wharton’s jelly.

Adult connective tissue has considerable structural 
diversity  because  the  proportion  of  cells  to  ﬁbers 
varies  from  tissue  to  tissue. This  variable  cell-to-
ﬁbers  ratio  is  the  basis  for  the  subclassiﬁcation  of 
adult connective tissue into two types of connective 
tissue proper:

1. Loose (or areolar) connective tissue  
2. Dense connective tissue  
Loose connective tissue contains more cells than 
collagen ﬁbers and is generally found surrounding 
blood  vessels,  nerves,  and  muscles.  This  type  of 
connective tissue facilitates dissection as performed 
by anatomists, pathologists, and surgeons. 

Dense connective tissue contains more collagen 
ﬁbers  than  cells.  When  the  collagen  ﬁbers  are 
preferentially  oriented,  as  in  tendons,  ligaments, 
and  the  cornea,  the  tissue  is  called  dense  regular 
connective  tissue.  When  the  collagen  ﬁbers  are 

randomly  oriented,  as  in  the  dermis  of  the  skin 
and submucosa of the alimentary tube, the tissue is 
called dense irregular connective tissue.

Adult connective tissue includes reticular and elastic 

connective tissue that predominate in speciﬁc organs. 
Reticular connective tissue (Figure 4-2) contains 
reticular ﬁbers, which form the stroma of organs of 
the lymphoid-immune system (for example, lymph 
nodes and spleen), the hematopoietic bone marrow, 
and the liver. This type of connective tissue provides 
a  delicate  meshwork  to  allow  passage  of  cells  and 
ﬂuid. 

Elastic  connective  tissue  (Figure  4-2)  contains 
irregularly arranged elastic ﬁbers in ligaments of the 
vertebral column or concentrically arranged sheets 
or  laminae  in  the  wall  of  the  aorta.   This  type  of 
connective tissue provides elasticity.    

The special connective tissue category comprises 
types of connective tissue with special properties not 
observed in the embryonic or adult connective tissue 
proper.  There are four types of special connective 
tissue (Figure 4-2): 
1. Adipose tissue. 
2. Cartilage. 
3. Bone.  
4. Hematopoietic tissue (bone marrow). 
Adipose tissue has more cells (called adipose cells 
or adipocytes) than collagen ﬁbers and ECM. This 
type  of    connective  tissue  is  the  most    signiﬁcant 
energy storage site of the body.

Cartilage  and  bone,  also  regarded  as  special 
connective  tissue,  are  traditionally  placed 
in 
separate  categories.  Essentially,  cartilage  and  bone 
are  dense  connective  tissues  with  specialized  cells 
and ECM. An important difference is that cartilage 
has  a  noncalciﬁed  ECM,  whereas  the  ECM  of 
bone  is  calciﬁed.  These  two  types  of  specialized 
connective 
and 
mechanical  functions  that  are  discussed  later  (see 
Cartilage  and  Bone). The  hematopoietic  tissue  is 
found in the marrow of selected bones.  This type 
of connective tissue is discussed in Chapter 6, Blood 
and Hematopoiesis.

Reticular connective tissue is characteristic of 
lymphatic tissues (lymph node and spleen) and

   Reticular fibers, synthesized by fibroblasts (also 
called reticular cells), are thin and wavy structures.

Elastic connective tissue is characteristic of the walls

Box 4-A  |  Types of collagens: Highlights to remember

•  Type I collagen
Present in bone, tendon, dentin, and skin as banded ﬁbers with a transverse 
periodicity of 64 nm. This type of collagen provides tensile strength.
•  Type II collagen
Observed in hyaline and elastic cartilage as ﬁbrils thinner than type I collagen.
•  Type III collagen
Present in the reticular lamina of basement membranes, as a component of 
reticular ﬁbers (30 nm in diameter). This is the ﬁrst collagen type synthesized 
during wound healing and then is replaced by type I collagen.
    Reticular ﬁbers can be better recognized after impregnation with silver salts 
because reticular ﬁbers are argyrophilic (silver-loving; Greek argyros, silver). 
Silver impregnation is a valuable tool in pathology for the recognition of distor-
tions in the distribution of reticular ﬁbers in alterations of lymphoid organs.
Reticular ﬁbers, and collagens in general, are glycoproteins and can be recog-
nized with the periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction because of their carbohy-
drate content.
   •  Type IV collagen
Present in the basal lamina. This type of collagen does not form bundles. Single 
molecules of type IV collagen bind to one of the type IV collagen-binding sites of 
laminin.
•  Type V collagen
Observed in amnion and chorion in the fetus and in muscle and tendon 
sheaths. This type of collagen does not form banded ﬁbrils.

the  typical  features  of  a  protein-secreting  cell:  a 
well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and a 
Golgi apparatus.

The  ﬁbroblast  synthesizes  and  continuously 
secretes  proteoglycans,  glycoproteins  and 
the 
precursor  molecules  of  various  types  of  collagens 
and elastic ﬁbers. 

Different 

types  of  collagen  proteins  and 
proteoglycans can be recognized as components of 
the basement membrane.  As you may remember, 
type IV collagen is found in the basal lamina and 
type  III  collagen  appears  in  the  reticular  lamina 
as a component of reticular ﬁbers (see Boxes 4-A 
and  4-B).  Heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans  and 
the  ﬁbronectin,  two  additional  products  of  the 
ﬁbroblast, are present in the basement membrane. 
The  protein  collagen  is  a  component  of  collagen 
and reticular ﬁbers but elastic ﬁbers lack collagen.

Box 4-B  |  Cell types making collagen: Highlights to remember

•  The so-called reticular cell is in fact a ﬁbroblast that synthesizes reticular ﬁ-
bers containing type III collagen. Reticular ﬁbers form the stroma of bone marrow 
and lymphoid organs.
•  The osteoblast (bone), chondroblast (cartilage), and odontoblast (teeth) 
also synthesize collagen. These cell types are ﬁbroblast equivalents in their 
respective tissues. Therefore, the synthesis of collagen is not limited to the ﬁbro-
blast in connective tissue. In fact, epithelial cells synthesize type IV collagen. 
•  A ﬁbroblast may simultaneously synthesize more than one type of col-
lagen.
•  Smooth muscle cells, found in the wall of arteries, intestine, the respiratory 
bronchial tree, and uterus, can synthesize types I and III collagen.

Collagen

Collagen: Synthesis, secretion, and assembly
Collagens  are  generally  divided  into  two  categories: 
ﬁbrillar collagens (forming ﬁbrils with a characteristic 
banded  pattern),  and  nonﬁbrillar  collagens  (see 
Box 4-C). 

The  synthesis  of  collagen  starts  in  the  rough 
endoplasmic reticulum (RER) following the typical 
pathway of synthesis for export from the cell (Figure 
4-3).

Preprocollagen  is  synthesized  with  a  signal 
peptide  and  released  as  procollagen  within  the 
cisterna of the RER. Procollagen consists of three 
polypeptide  (cid:95)  chains,  lacking  the  signal  peptide, 
assembled in a triple helix.

Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are typically 
observed  in  collagen.  Hydroxylation  of  proline 
and lysine residues occurs in the RER and requires 
ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a cofactor. Inadequate 
wound healing is characteristic of scurvy, caused by 
a vitamin C deﬁciency.

Packaging and secretion of procollagen take place 
in the Golgi apparatus.  Upon secretion of procollagen, 
the following three events occur in the extracellular 
space:

1.  Enzymatic  (procollagen  peptidase)  removal 
of most of the nonhelical endings of procollagen to 
give rise to soluble tropocollagen molecules. 

2.  Self-aggregation  of  tropocollagen  molecules 
by a stepwise overlapping process to form collagen 
ﬁbrils.

3. Cross-linking of tropocollagen molecules, leading 
to  the  formation  of  collagen  ﬁbers.  Lysyl  oxidase 

Box 4-C  |  Characteristics of collagens

• Collagen is a three-chain ﬁbrous protein in which the (cid:95) 
chains coil around each other (called a coiled-coil struc-
ture) like the strands of a rope. This triple-helix molecular 
organization generates a protein with considerable 
tensile strength. 
• In ﬁbrillar collagen (types I, II, III, and V), the com-
pletely processed molecule contains one triple helix, 
which accounts for almost the entire length of each mol-
ecule. Multiple triple helices of collagen ﬁbers are aligned 
end-to-end and side-by-side in a regular arrangement. 
As a result, collagen ﬁbers form dark and light periodic 
bands observed with the electron microscope.
• In nonﬁbrillar collagens, such as type IV collagen, 
several shorter triple-helical segments are separated 
by non-helical triple domains and the N-terminal and C-

catalyzes cross-links between tropocollagens.

Groups of collagen ﬁbers orient along the same 
axis  to  form  collagen  bundles. The  formation  of 
collagen  bundles  is  guided  by  proteoglycans  and 
other  glycoproteins,  including  FACIT  (for  ﬁbril-
associated  collagens  with 
interrupted  helices) 
collagens.

Pathology: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome  (Figure  4-4)  is  clinically 
characterized  by  hyperelasticity  of  the  skin  and 
hypermobility of the joints. 

The  major  defect  resides 

in  the  synthesis, 
processing,  and  assembly  of  collagen.  Several 

clinical  subtypes  are  observed.  They  are  classiﬁed 
by the degree of severity and the mutations in the 
collagen genes. For example, the vascular type form 
of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, caused by a mutation in  
the COL3A1 gene, is associated with severe vascular 
alterations  leading  to  the  development  of  varicose 
veins  and  spontaneous  rupture  of  major  arteries. 
A  deﬁciency  in  the  synthesis  of  type  III  collagen, 
prevalent  in  the  walls  of  blood  vessels,  is  the 
major  defect.  Arthrochalasia  and  dermatosparaxsis 
types 
display 
congenital  dislocation  of  the  hips  and  marked 
joint  hypermobility.  Mutations  in  the  COL1A1
and  COL1A2  genes  (Figure  4-5),  encoding  type  I 
collagen,  and  procollagen  N-peptidase  gene  disrupt 
the cleavage site at the N-terminal of the molecule 
and affect the conversion of procollagen to collagen 
in some individuals.

of  Ehlers-Danlos 

syndrome 

Elastic ﬁbers
Elastic ﬁbers are synthesized by ﬁbroblasts (in skin 
and tendons), chondroblasts (in elastic cartilage of 
the auricle of the ear, epiglottis, larynx, and auditory 
tubes),  and  smooth  muscle  cells  (in  large  blood 
vessels  like  the  aorta  and  in  the  respiratory  tree). 
Like collagen, the synthesis of elastic ﬁbers involves 
both the RER and the Golgi apparatus (Figure 4-6). 
Proelastin,  the  precursor  of  elastin,  is  cleaved 
and  secreted  as  tropoelastin.  In  the  extracellular 
space, tropoelastin interacts with ﬁbrillins 1 and 2 
and ﬁbulin 1 to organize elastic ﬁbers (0.1-0.2 (cid:43)m 
in  diameter),  which  aggregate  to  form  bundles  of 
elastic ﬁbers. 

Tropoelastin  contains  a  characteristic  but 
uncommon  amino  acid:  desmosine.  Two  lysine

A mutation in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, encoding the (cid:95)1 
and (cid:95)2 chains of type I collagen, respectively, involves cleavage 
sites for the N-terminal region of the molecule and interferes with 
the conversion of procollagen to collagen. This leads to defective 
cross-linking and a consequent reduction in the tensile strength 
of tendons (rich in type I collagen). This mutation is observed in 
some clinical forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

   Strickler syndrome is characterized by myopia, hypoplasia of 
the lower jaw, and arthritis associated with dysplasia of the 
epiphyses. Type II collagen is abundant in cartilage and vitreous 
humor (eye). The COL2A1 gene is mutated.
   Osteogenesis imperfecta type I is associated with bone 
fragility. COL1A1 point mutations determine a reduction in the 
production of type I collagen required for normal ossification.

residues of tropoelastin are oxidized by lysyl oxidase 
to  form  a  desmosine  ring  that  cross-links  two 
tropoelastin  molecules.  Cross-linking  enables  the 
stretching  and  recoil  of  tropoelastin,  like  rubber 
bands.  

Elastic  ﬁbers  are  produced  during  embryonic 
development and in adolescence but not so much 
in adults. Although elastic ﬁbers are resilient during 
human  life,  many  tissues  decrease  elasticity  with 
age, in particular the skin, which develops wrinkles. 

Under  the  light  microscope,  elastic  ﬁbers  stain 
black  or  dark  blue  with  orcein,  a  natural  dye 
obtained from lichens.

Under the electron microscope, a cross section of 
a single elastic ﬁber shows a dense core surrounded 
by microﬁbrils of  ﬁbulin 1 and ﬁbrillins (see Figure 
4-6).

                        Marfan syndrome

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. 
Patients are tall, with long arms, legs, fingers, and 
toes (arachnodactyly). Mitral valve prolapse, 
dilation of the root of the aorta (detected by 
echocardiography), and aortic dissection (detected 
by MRI) are typical cardiovascular manifestations.
Heart-related complications may shorten the life span 
of people with Marfan syndrome.    

Etiology: an inherited defect in the gene encoding 
the protein fibrillin-1 is responsible for the Marfan 
syndrome. Fibrillin-1 is a component of 
tropoelastin, a microfibril predominant in the aorta, 
skin, ligaments, and the ciliary zonular fibers of the 
lens. An increase in proteoglycans between the 
elastic lamellae weakens the wall of the aorta.

Connective Tissue, 4th ed. St. Louis, Mosby, 1972.

in which the elastic tissue is weakened. Defects are 
predominantly observed in three systems: the ocular, 
skeletal,  and  cardiovascular  systems.  The  ocular 
defects include myopia and detached lens (ectopia 
lentis).  The skeletal  defects  (Figure 4-7) include 
long  and  thin  arms  and  legs  (dolichostenomelia), 
hollow  chest  (pectus  excavatum),  scoliosis,  and  
elongated ﬁngers (arachnodactyly). 

Cardiovascular abnormalities are life-threatening. 
Patients with Marfan syndrome display prolapse of 
the mitral valve and dilation of the ascending aorta. 
Dilation  of  the  aorta  and  peripheral  arteries  may 
progress to dissecting aneurysm (Greek aneurysma, 
widening) and rupture. 

Medical  treatment,  such  as  administration  of 
(cid:96)-adrenergic blockers to reduce the force of systolic 
contraction in order to diminish stress on the aorta, 
and limited heavy exercise, increase the survival rate 
of patients with Marfan syndrome.

Defects observed in Marfan syndrome are caused 
by poor recoiling of the elastic lamellae dissociated 
by an increase in proteoglycans (see Figure 4-7). In 
the skeletal system, the periosteum, a relatively rigid 
layer  covering  the  bone,  is  abnormally  elastic  and 
does not provide an oppositional force during bone 
development, resulting in skeletal defects.  

A mutation of the ﬁbrillin 1 gene on chromosome 
15 is responsible for Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is 
present  in  the  aorta,  suspensory  ligaments  of  the 
lens  (see  Chapter  9,    Sensory  Organs: Vision  and 
Hearing), and the periosteum (see Bone).

A  homologous  ﬁbrillin  2  gene  is  present  on 
in  the  ﬁbrillin  2 

chromosome  5.  Mutations 

gene  cause  a  disease  called  congenital  contractural 
arachnodactyly.  This disease affects the skeletal system, 
but ocular and cardiovascular defects are not observed.

Macrophages
Macrophages have phagocytic properties and derive 
from monocytes, cells formed in the bone marrow 
(Figure 4-8).  

Monocytes  circulate  in  blood  and  migrate  into 
the connective tissue, where they differentiate into 
macrophages.  Macrophages have speciﬁc names in 
certain organs; for example, they are called Kupffer 
cells in the liver, osteoclasts in bone, and microglial 
cells  in  the  central  nervous  system.    Macrophages 
migrate  to  the  site  of  inﬂammation,  attracted  by 
certain  mediators,  particularly  C5a  (a  member  of 
the complement cascade; see Chapter 10, Immune-
Lymphatic System).

Macrophages  in  the  connective  tissue  have  the 

following structural features:

1. They contain abundant lysosomes required for 

the breakdown of phagocytic materials. 

2. Active macrophages have numerous phagocytic 
vesicles (or phagosomes) for the transient storage of 
ingested materials. 

3. The nucleus has an irregular outline.
Macrophages of the connective tissue have three 

major functions: 

1. To turn over senescent ﬁbers and ECM material.
2.  To  present  antigens  to  lymphocytes  as  part 
of  inﬂammatory  and  immunologic  responses  (see 
Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System).

3. To produce cytokines (for example, interleukin-1,

the antigen is broken down into small peptide 
fragments, which bind to a receptor molecule,

(MHC).

to a lymphocyte (T cell derived from the

factor  ligand,  an  inﬂammatory  mediator  (see 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).

Mast cells 
Like macrophages, mast cells (Mastzellen; German, 
mast, fattening) originate in the bone marrow from 
myeloid precursor cells lacking cytoplasmic granules 

but expressing the c-kit receptor (a tyrosine kinase), 
its  ligand  stem  cell  factor  and  Fc(cid:161)RI,  the  high 
afﬁnity receptor for immunoglobulin E.

Mast cells

Mast  cells  and  basophils  circulating  in  blood 
derive  from  the  same  myeloid  progenitor  in  the 
bone marrow. Basophils leave the bone marrow with 
cytoplasmic granules; mast cells acquire them later 
when  they  rich  their  ﬁnal  destination.  Mast  cells 
express (cid:95)4(cid:96)7 integrin, involved in the relocation or 
homing process.

There are two populations of mast cells:
1. Connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs), that 
migrate and locate around blood vessels and nerve 
endings of the connective tissue.

2.  Mucosa  mast  cells  (MMCs),  that  associate 
with T cells, predominantly in the lamina propria 
of the mucosae of the intestine and lungs. 

An  important  distinction  is  that  CTMCs  are 
T cell–independent in contrast to MMCs, whose 
activities are T cell–dependent.   

The mast cell is the source of vasoactive mediators 
contained  in  cytoplasmic  granules  (Figure  4-9). 
These  granules  contain  histamine,  heparin,  and 
chemotactic  mediators 
to  attract  monocytes, 
neutrophils, and eosinophils circulating in blood to 
the site of mast cell activation. 

Leukotrienes are vasoactive products of mast cells. 
Leukotrienes are not present in granules; instead, 
they  are  released  from  the  cell  membrane  of  the 
mast cells as metabolites of arachidonic acid (see 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling). 

CTMCs differ from MMCs in the number and 
size  of  metachromatic  (see  Box  4-D)  cytoplasmic 
granules,  which  tend  to  be  more  abundant  in 
CTMCs.  In  addition,  intestinal  MMCs  contain 
mast cell chymase protein MCP-1 (a chymotryptic 
peptidase), whereas CTMCs lack this protease but 
express MCP-4 (a chymase), MCP-5 (an elastase), 
MCP-6  and  MCP-7  (tryptases)  and    CPA3  (mast 
cell carboxypeptidase A). These mast cell proteases 
have a pro-inﬂammatory action.

Although CTMCs and MMCs have the same cell 
precursor,  the  deﬁnitive  structural  and  functional 
characteristics of mast cells are acquired on the site 
of differentiation (connective tissue or mucosae).

Box 4-D  |  Metachromasia: Highlights to remember

•  The  granules of the mast cell have a staining property known as metachro-
masia (Greek meta, beyond; chroma, color). 
• After staining with a metachromatic dye, such as toluidine blue, the mast cell 
granules stain with a color that is different from the color of the dye (purple-red 
instead of blue).
•  This phenomenon is determined by a change in the electronic structure of 
the dye molecule after binding to the granular material. In addition, mast cell 
granules are PAS positive because of their glycoprotein nature.

an  important  role  in  the  regulation  of  vascular 
permeability  and  bronchial  smooth  muscle  tone 
during  allergic  hypersensitivity  reactions  (for 
example, in asthma, hay fever, and eczema).  

(IgE) 

receptors 

The surface of mast cells and basophils contains 
(Fc(cid:161)RI).  
immunoglobulin  E 
Antigens bind to  two adjacent Fc(cid:161)RI receptors and 
the  mast  cell  becomes  IgE-sensitized  (see  Figure 
4-9). An IgE-sensitized mast cell releases Ca2+ from 
intracellular  storage  sites  as  well  as  the  content  of 
the  cytoplasmic  granules  by  a  process  known  as 
degranulation.  

The  release  of  histamine  during 

  asthma 
(Greek  asthma,  panting)  causes  dyspnea  (Greek 
dyspnoia, difﬁculty with breathing) triggered by the 
histamine-induced  spasmodic  contraction  of  the 
smooth muscle surrounding the bronchioles and the 
hypersecretion of goblet cells and mucosal glands of 
bronchi.  

During  hay  fever,  histamine  increases  vascular 
permeability leading to edema (excessive accumulation 
of ﬂuid in intercellular spaces). 

Mast  cells  in  the  connective  tissue  of  skin 
release  leukotrienes  that  induce  increased  vascular 
permeability associated with urticaria (Latin urtica, 
stinging  nettle),  a  transient  swelling  in  the  dermis 
of the skin.

Plasma cells
The  plasma  cell,  which  derives 
the 
differentiation  of  B  lymphocytes  (also  called  B 
cells),  synthesizes  and  secretes  a  single  class  of 
immunoglobulin  (Figure  4-10).  We  discuss  in 
Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System, details of 
the origin of plasma cells.

Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins, and therefore 
plasma cells have the three structural characteristics 
of cells active in protein synthesis and secretion: 

1. A well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum  
2. An extensive Golgi apparatus 
3. A  prominent nucleolus 
At  the  light  microscopic  level,  most  of  the 
cytoplasm of a plasma cell is basophilic because of 
the large amount of ribosomes associated with the 
endoplasmic reticulum. A clear area near the nucleus 
is  slightly  acidophilic  and  represents  the  Golgi 
apparatus. The nucleus has a characteristic cartwheel 
conﬁguration created by the particular distribution 
of heterochromatin.

In  addition,  epithelial

constituents. An example is the family of integrins 
with  binding  afﬁnity  for  laminin  and  ﬁbronectin. 
Integrins  interact  with  the  cytoskeleton  (F-actin), 
strengthening  cell  interactions  with  the  ECM  by 
establishing focal contacts or modifying cell shape 
or adhesion.

Several noncollagenous glycoproteins of the ECM 
mediate  interactions  with  cells  and  regulate  the 
assembly  of  ECM  components.    Noncollagenous 

glycoproteins  have  a  widespread  distribution  in 
several  connective  tissues,  although  cartilage  and

enzymes become active and break down the antigen into small 
peptides. Small peptides bind to MHC molecules inserted in the

functions  of  proteoglycans  by  establishing  links 
with  cell  surface  components,  growth  factors,  and 
other ECM constituents.  

Different types of  GAGs  are attached to a core 
protein to form a proteoglycan. The core protein, in 
turn, is linked to a hyaluronan molecule by a linker 
protein.  The hyaluronan molecule is the axis of a 
proteoglycan  aggregate.  Proteoglycans  are  named 
according  to  the  prevalent  GAG  (for  example, 
proteoglycan  chondroitin  sulfate,  proteoglycan 
dermatan sulfate, proteoglycan heparan sulfate). 

The embryonic connective tissue of the umbilical 
cord  (Wharton’s  jelly)  is  predominantly  ECM 
material surrounding the two umbilical arteries and 
the single umbilical vein. 

Proteoglycans have extremely high charge density 
and,  therefore,  signiﬁcant  osmotic  pressure. These 
attributes  enable  a  connective  tissue  bed  to  resist 
compression  because  of  the  very  high  swelling 
capacity  of  these  molecules.  The  umbilical  blood 
vessels,  crucial  elements  for  fetal-maternal  ﬂuid, 
gas, and nutritional exchange, are surrounded by a

General Pathology: Degradation of the extracellular 
matrix
can  be  degraded  by  matrix 
The  ECM 
metalloproteinases (MMPs; also called matrixins), 
a  family  of  zinc-dependent  proteases  secreted  as 
pro-enzymes  (zymogens)  proteolytically  activated 
in  the  ECM.  The  activity  of  MMPs  in  the 
extracellular  space  can  be  speciﬁcally  balanced  by 
tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) during tissue 
remodeling. 

The expression of MMP genes can be regulated by 
inﬂammatory cytokines, growth factors, hormones, 
cell–cell and cell–matrix interaction. Humans have 
23 MMP genes

The  degradation  of  the  ECM  occurs  normally 
during the development, growth, tissue repair and 
wound healing. However, excessive degradation of 
the ECM is observed in several pathologic conditions 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic 
tissue ulcers and cancer. Tumor invasion, metastasis, 
and  tumor  angiogenesis  require  the  participation 
of MMPs whose expression increases in association 
with tumorigenesis.

Members of the family of MMPs include several 

subgroups based on their substrates (Figure 4-12):

1. Collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-
13)  degrade  types  I,  II,  and  III  collagens  and 
other  ECM  proteins.  MMP-1  is  synthesized  by 
ﬁbroblasts, chondrocytes, keratinocytes, monocytes, 
and  macrophages,  hepatocytes,  and  tumor  cells. 
MMP-8  is  stored  in  cytoplasmic  granules  of 
polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes  and  released  in 
response to a stimulus. MMP-13 can degrade several 
collagens (types I, II, III, IV, IX, X, and XI), laminin 
and ﬁbronectin, and other ECM components. 

2.  Gelatinases  (MMP-2  and  MMP-9)  can 
degrade  a  number  of  ECM  molecules  including 
type IV, V and XI collagens, laminin and aggrecan 
core protein. Similar to collagenases, MMP-2, but 
not MMP-9, can digest type I, II and III collagens. 
Gelatinases are produced by alveolar macrophages.

3.  Stromelysins  MMP-3  and  MMP-10  digest  a 
number of ECM molecules, but MMP-11 activity 
is very weak toward ECM molecules. Stromelysins 
degrade basement membrane components (type IV 
collagen and ﬁbronectin).

4. Matrilysins (MMP-7 and MMP-26). MMP-
7  is  synthesized  by  epithelial  cells  and  cleaves  cell 
surface  molecules  such  as  pro–(cid:95)-defensin,  Fas-
ligand,  and 
ligand,  pro-tumor  necrosis  factor 
E-cadherin.  MMP-26 
is  expressed 
in  normal 
endometrial cells and some carcinoma cells. 

5. Membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) include 

two categories: 

•  Transmembrane proteins (MMP-14, MMP-15, 

MMP-16, and MMP-24).

•  Glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI)-anchored 

proteins (MMP-17 and MMP-25).

MT-MMPs  are  activated  intracellularly  and  are 

active enzymes on the cell surface.

A number of MMPs are not grouped within the 

above categories:

1.  Metalloelastase  (MMP-12)  is  expressed  by 
and 

chondrocytes 

macrophages,  hypertrophic 
osteoclasts.

2.  MMP-19,  also  called  rheumatoid  arthritis 
synovial  inﬂammation,    digests  components  of 
basement  membranes.  MMP-19  is  found  in  the 
activated lymphocytes and plasma cells from patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis.

TIMPs  (TIMP-1, TIM-2, TIMP-3  and TIMP-
4)  are  inhibitors  of  MMPs.  TIMP-3  is  a  major 
regulator of MMP activities.

  MMPs  are  a  target  of  therapeutic  intervention 
to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis. We come 
back  to  this  topic  in  Chapter  23,  Fertilization, 
Placentation,  and  Lactation,  when  we  discuss  the 
signiﬁcance  of  metalloproteinases  during  the  early 
stages  of  embryo  implantation  in  the  endometrial 
stroma or decidua.

General  Pathology:  Molecular  biology  of  tumor 
invasion
As  discussed  in  the  Neoplasia  section  of  Chapter 
3,  Cell  Signaling,  invasion  and  metastasis  are  two 
important  events  of  carcinoma  (Greek  karkinoma, 
from karkinos, crab, cancer + oma, tumor), a tumor 
derived from epithelial tissues. 

Adenoma  is  a  structurally  benign  tumor  of 
glandular epithelial cell origin lacking invasive and 
metastatic  properties.  Malignant  carcinomas  may 
arise from benign adenomas. For example, a small 
benign adenoma or polyp of the colon can become 
an invasive carcinoma. 

Sarcoma  (Greek  sarx,  ﬂesh  +  oma)  is  a  tumor 
derived  from  the  connective  tissues  (muscle, 
bone,  cartilage)  and  mesodermal  cells.  For 
example, ﬁbrosarcoma derives from ﬁbroblasts and 
osteosarcoma originates from bone.

Invasion  is  deﬁned  by  the  breakdown  of  the 
basement membrane by tumor cells and implies the 
transition from precancer to cancer. Metastasis is the 
spread of tumor cells throughout the body through 
blood  and  lymphatic  vessels,  generally  leading  to 
death.  Figure  4-13  illustrates  and  describes  the 
initial events of tumor cell invasion.

matrix metalloproteinase family to degrade various 
types of collagen as we have seen in the preceding 
section. Normal tissues produce tissue inhibitors of 
metalloproteinases that are neutralized by carcinoma 
cells. Tumors that behave aggressively are capable of 
overpowering the protease inhibitors.

One critical event during metastasis is angiogenesis, 
the  development  of  blood  vessels.  Blood  vessels 
supply  oxygen  and  nutrients  required  for  tumor 
growth. Angiogenesis is stimulated by tumor cells, 
in particular the proliferation of capillary endothelial 
cells forming new capillaries in the tumoral growth. 
In  Chapter  12,  Cardiovascular  System,  we  discuss 
the mechanism of action and targets of endostatin 
and  angiostatin,  two  new  proteins  that  inhibit 
angiogenesis.

Adipose tissue or fat
There are two classes of adipose tissue: 

1.  White  fat,  the  major  reserve  of    long-term 

energy and also an endocrine tissue   

2. Brown fat, which participates in thermogenesis  
Similar  to  ﬁbroblasts,  chondroblasts,  osteoblasts 
and myoblasts, white fat and brown fat adipose cells 
derive from a mesenchymal stem cells in a process 
known as adipogenesis. 

Adipogenesis
Adipogenesis  requires  the  activation  of  the  master 
adipogenic regulator, the DNA binding peroxisome 
proliferator-activated  receptor-(cid:97)  (PPAR(cid:97)),  in  the 
presence  of  insulin    and  glucocorticoids  (Figure 
4-14). 

Preadipocytes  can  follow  two  different  cell 

differentiation pathways: 

1. One pathway results in the formation of white fat 

Many  carcinomas  produce  members  of  the 

preadipocytes directly from mesenchymal stem cells.

Figure 4-13. Tumor invasion and metastasis

The epithelium shows an 
increased cell proliferation 
rate and incomplete 
maturation. Cells have not 
invaded the basement 
membrane and remain 
confined within the 
epithelial layer. This stage is 
known as dysplasia (not 
shown).

The cell proliferation rate 
and incomplete maturation 
are more prominent. The 
epithelial organization is 
lost. Cells have not invaded 
the basement membrane 
and remain confined within 
the epithelial layer. This 
stage is known as 
carcinoma in situ.

Carcinoma in situ

Microinvasive carcinoma 

Uterine cervix

The expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, decreases. This 
decrease weakens the cohesive nature of the intraepithelial tumor cells, and 
microinvasion starts when the basement membrane breaks down. 
   Collagenase IV, released by invading tumor cells, dissolves the basement membrane 
and allows tumor cells to invade the subjacent connective tissue.  Other proteases, such 
as plasminogen activator, collagenases I, II, and III, cathepsins, and hyaluronidase, 
destroy noncollagenous glycoproteins and proteoglycans, enabling further advancement 
of tumor cells into the destroyed connective tissue.
   Invading tumor cells overexpress integrins (laminin and fibronectin receptors) to 
facilitate cell attachment and progression in the connective tissue. Tumor cells generally 
invade along pathways that provide low resistance, such as connective tissue.

As tumor cells start their invasive phase, they secrete: 
1. Autocrine motility factors (to direct the motion of 

the advancing tumor cells).

2. Vascular permeability factors (to enable plasma 

proteins and nutritional factors to accumulate).
3. Angiogenic factor (to increase the vascularity, 
oxygen and nutritional support of the growing tumor). 
See Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System, for a 
discussion of tumor angiogenesis.
   Because newly formed blood vessels are connected 
with the general circulation, tumor cells can rapidly 
enter the blood vessels and disseminate to distant 
tissues. This event is known as metastasis.

2. The other pathway generates myoblasts and brown 
fat  preadipocytes  from  a  common  MYF5+PAX7+ 
(myogenic factor 5+ and paired-box 7+) precursor. 
Therefore, white fat and brown fat precursor cells 
diverge in early development.

The  differentiation  of  white  fat  preadipocytes 
into end-stage adipocytes is driven by PPAR(cid:97) and 
C/EBPs 
(CCAAT/enhancer-binding  proteins). 
The differentiation of the MYF5+PAX7+ myoblast/

brown  fat  preadipocyte  precursor  into  brown  fat 
preadipocytes  requires  also  PPAR(cid:97)  in  addition 
to  BMP7  (bone  morphogenetic  protein  7)  and 
PRDM16 (transcriptional co-regulator PR domain-
containing 16). PRDM16 is essential for brown fat 
adipogenesis.

Aggregates of epithelial-like multilocular, mitochondria-rich adipocytes 
surrounded by abundant blood vessels are characteristic of brown fat. The 
main function of brown fat is to dissipate energy instead of storing it as does 
white fat.  Heat is generated by uncoupling the production of ATP from the 
movement of H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane down the 
concentration gradient. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) activates uncoupling.  
Mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of UCP-1 protein are key 
features of thermogenesis by brown fat.

adipocytes derive from different precursors.
   White fat preadipocytes and brown fat preadipocytes 
express PPAR(cid:97) (peroxisome proliferator–activated 
receptor-(cid:97)), the master regulator of adipogenesis and 
C/EBPs (CCAAT/enhance-binding proteins).

In the presence of cold exposure and (cid:96)-adrenergic

Figure 4-14).  
The  single

sections,  capillaries  appear  as  single  structures 
that  may  contain  blood  cell  elements,  whereas 
adipocytes form aggregates.

The surface of lipid droplets is surrounded by the 
protein perilipin. Phosphorylated perilipin changes 
its  conformation,  thus  enabling  lipase-mediated 
breakdown  and  release  of  lipids.  Each  perilipin-
coated lipid droplet is in contact with the cytosol;

lipid  droplets  are  classiﬁed  as  cell  inclusions. 
Aggregates  of  fat  droplets  can  be  visualized  by 
histochemistry  under  speciﬁc  technical  conditions 
(see Box 4-E). 

Lipid  droplets  contain  about  95%  triglycerides 
rich in carotene, a lipid-soluble pigment that gives 
the so-called white fat a yellowish color. Adipocytes 
synthesize  lipoprotein  lipase.  Lipoprotein  lipase 
is  transferred  to  endothelial  cells  in  the  adjacent 
blood vessels to enable the passage of fatty acids and 
triglycerides into the adipocytes. 

The blood supply to white fat, mainly capillaries, 

is not as extensive as in brown fat. 

The  storage  of  lipids  in  mature  adipocytes  is 
regulated  by  the  antilipolytic  effect  of  insulin  and 
prostaglandins resulting in the inhibition of lipase. 
The breakdown and release of lipids is regulated by 
the lipolytic  effect  of  epinephrine, glucagon, and 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)  as  a  result 
of  the  phosphorylation  of  lipase  and  perilipin  (see 
Figure  4-15).  Adipose  tissue  is  innervated  by  the 
sympathetic nervous system.

storage droplets (multilocular; Latin multus, many;

Box 4-F  |  How chondrocytes survive

•   In cartilage, chondroblasts and chondrocytes are sustained by diffusion of 
nutrients and metabolites through the aqueous phase of the extracellular 
matrix.
•   In bone, deposits of calcium salts in the matrix prevent the diffusion of 
soluble solutes, which thus must be transported from blood vessels to osteo-
cytes through canaliculi (see Bone).

vessels  and  sympathetic  adrenergic  nerve  ﬁbers. 
Lipochrome pigment and abundant mitochondria, 
rich in cytochromes, give this type of fat a brownish 
color.

As  stated  initially,  the  main  function  of  brown 
fat  is  to  dissipate  energy  in  the  form  of  heat 
(thermogenesis) in cold environments as a protective 
mechanism  in  the  newborn.  Thermogenesis  by 
brown  fat  cells  has  two  requirements  (see  Figure 
4-14): 

1. Mitochondrial biogenesis  
2. The expression of UCP-1  
As we brieﬂy mentioned in Chapter 2, Epithelial 
Glands,  in  our  discussion  on  UCP  transporters 
in  mitochondria,  UCP-1  dissipates  the  proton 
gradient established across the inner mitochondrial 
membrane when electrons pass along the electron-
transport  chain.  Thermogenesis  occurs  because 
UCP-1  allows  the  reentry  of  protons  down  their 
concentration  gradient  into  the  mitochondrial 
matrix  and  uncouples  respiration 
from  ATP 
production.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Obesity
Obesity  is  a  disorder  of  energy  balance.  It  occurs 
when  energy  intake  exceeds  energy  expenditure. 
Protection  against  obesity  without  consideration 
of  energy intake results in an increase in circulating 
levels of triglycerides, and  excessive accumulation 
of  fat  in  liver  (steatosis). The  metabolic  activities 
of  adipocytes  have  very 
signiﬁcant  clinical 
consequences.  An  increase  in  visceral  adiposity  is 
associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  insulin  resistance 
(see Chapter 19, Endocrine System), dyslipidemia 
(alteration  in  blood  fat  levels),  and  cardiovascular 
disease.

One  of  the  secreted  products  of  adipocytes  is 

Box 4-G  |  Cartilage repair after injury

•   Cartilage has a modest repair capacity. Cartilage injuries frequently result in 
the formation of repair cartilage from the perichondrium.  
• This repair cartilage contains undifferentiated cells with a potential to differenti-
ate into chondrocytes that synthesize components of the cartilage matrix.  This 
important property facilitates the healing of a bone fracture as discussed later. 
•  The repair cartilage has a matrix composition intermediate between hyaline 
and ﬁbrous cartilage (for example, it contains both types I and II collagen).

leptin,  a  16-kd  protein  encoded  by  the  ob  gene.  
Leptin  is  released  into  the  circulation  and  acts 
peripherally  to  regulate  body  weight.  Leptin  acts 
on  hypothalamic  targets  involved  in  appetite  and 
energy  balance.  Leptin-deﬁcient  mice  (ob/ob)  are 
obese  and  infertile.  Both  conditions  are  reversible 
with leptin administration.

The  leptin  receptor  in  hypothalamic  target  cells 
shares sequence homology with cytokine receptors. 
During  inﬂammation,  the  release  of  the  cytokines 
interleukin-1  and  tumor  necrosis  factor  ligand 
increases leptin in serum, an indication that leptin 
interacts  with  cytokines  to  inﬂuence  responses  to 
infection  and  inﬂammatory  reactions.  Infections, 
injury,  and  inﬂammation  up-regulate  leptin  gene 
expression and serum protein levels. As we discuss 
later, leptin has a role in bone formation.

Adiponectin  (30-kd)  modulates  a  number  of 
metabolic  processes,  including  glucose  regulation 
and fatty acid breakdown. Obesity is associated with 
decreased  adiponectin.  Adiponectin  has  potential

Cartilage
Like 
the 
chondroblast  derives  from  a  mesenchymal  stem 
cell.  Chondroblasts  contain  lipids  and  glycogen,  a 
well-developed  RER  (basophilic  cytoplasm),  and 
Golgi apparatus (Figure 4-16). The proliferation of 
chondroblasts results in growth of the cartilage.

Similar to typical connective tissue, the cartilage 
consists  of  cells  embedded  in  ECM  surrounded 
by  the  perichondrium.  The  perichondrium  is 
formed by a layer of  undifferentiated cells that can 
differentiate into chondroblasts.

In  contrast  to  typical  connective  tissue,  the 
cartilage  is  avascular  and  cells  receive  nutrients 
by diffusion through the ECM (see Box 4-F).  At 
all  ages,  chondrocytes  have  signiﬁcant  nutritional 
requirements.  Although  they  rarely  divide  in  the 
adult cartilage, they can do so to enable healing of 
bone fractures (see Box 4-G).

Growth of cartilage (chondrogenesis)
Cartilage  grows  by  two  mechanisms  (Figure  4-17 
and Figure 4-18): 

1.  By  interstitial  growth,  from  chondrocytes 

within the cartilage (see Figure 4-17).

2. By appositional growth, from undifferentiated 
cells at the surface of the cartilage, or perichondrium 
(see Figure 4-18).  

During  chondrogenesis,  chondroblasts  produce 
and  deposit  type  II  collagen  ﬁbers  and  ECM 
(hyaluronic  acid  and  GAGs,  mainly  chondroitin 
sulfate and keratan sulfate) until chondroblasts are 
separated  and  trapped  within  spaces  in  the  matrix 

Figure 4-16. Chondrocytes and the surrounding matrix

Chondrocytes

The cells that produce the cartilage matrix are called chondroblasts or chondrocytes, depending on the 
relative maturity of the cells.
   Chondrocytes occupy small cavities in the extracellular matrix called lacunae. Two chondrocytes may occupy 
a single lacuna. 
   The extracellular matrix is compartmentalized. A pericellular matrix (visible with special staining) is 
circumscribed by a moderately stained territorial matrix and a less intensely stained interterritorial matrix.

called lacunae (Latin lacuna, small lake). The cells 
are  then  called  chondrocytes.   The  space  between 
the chondrocyte and the wall of the lacuna seen in 
histologic preparations is an artifact of ﬁxation.

The matrix in close contact with each chondrocyte 
forms  a  bluish  (with  hematoxylin  and  eosin), 
metachromatic  (see  Box  4-D),  or  PAS-positive 
basket-like structure called the territorial matrix.

Each  cluster  of  chondrocytes,  known  as  an 
isogenous  group,  is  enclosed  by  the  territorial 
matrix  and  separated  from  each  other  by  a  wider 
and pale interterritorial matrix.

Types of cartilage
There  are  three  major  types  of  cartilage  (Figure

During embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells aggregate and differentiate into 
chondroblasts, which form centers of chondrogenesis. A center of chondrogenesis 
consists of chondroblasts surrounded by extracellular matrix. Chondroblasts divide 
by mitosis, and the daughter cells remain within the same space or lacuna forming 
an isogenous cell group. The isogenous group is surrounded by territorial matrix.  
A wider interterritorial matrix surrounds the territorial matrix.
   This growth process, known as interstitial growth of the cartilage, is very active 
during endochondral ossification (see Chapter 5, Osteogenesis).

chondrogenic layer, differentiate into chondroblasts, 
which synthesize and secrete type II collagen 
precursors and other extracellular matrix components.
    By this mechanism, new layers of cells and 
extracellular matrix are added to the surface of the 
cartilage by the process of appositional growth, and 
the overall size of the cartilage increases. This process 
increases the size of the initial anlagen (German 
anlagen, plan, outline) of the future skeleton.

Sox9 causes campomelic dysplasia in humans consisting in 
bowing and angulation of long bones, hypoplasia of the pelvic

Sox9 controls the expression of type II collagen and the 
proteoglycan aggrecan.  
    Sox9-null chondrogenic cells remain in the perichondrium 
and do not differentiate into chondrocytes. Other members of

Cartilage types

Hyaline cartilage has the following features:
    It is avascular.
    It is surrounded by perichondrium (except in 
articular cartilage). The perichondrium has an 
outer fibrous layer, an inner chondrogenic 
layer and blood vessels.
     It consists of chondrocytes surrounded by 
territorial and interterritorial matrices containing 
type II collagen interacting with proteoglycans.
     It occurs in the temporary skeleton of the 
embryo, articular cartilage (see Box 4-H) and 
the cartilage of the respiratory tract (nose, 
larynx, trachea and bronchi) and costal cartilages.

Elastic cartilage has the following features:
    It is avascular.
    It is surrounded by perichondrium.
    It consists of chondrocytes surrounded by 
territorial and interterritorial matrices containing 
type II collagen interacting with proteoglycans 
and elastic fibers, which can be stained by 
orcein for light microscopy.
    It occurs in the external ear, epiglottis, and 
auditory tube.

Perichondrium

Chondrocytes

Elastic fibers

Fibrocartilage has the following features:
    It is generally avascular.
    It lacks a perichondrium.
    It consists of chondrocytes and fibroblasts 
surrounded by type I collagen and a less rigid 
extracellular matrix. Fibrocartilage is considered 
an intermediate tissue between hyaline cartilage 
and dense connective tissue.
    It predominates in the intervertebral disks, 
articular disks of the knee, mandible, 
sternoclavicular joints, and pubic symphysis.

Box 4-H  |  Cartilage of the joints

•   The specialized extracellular matrix of hyaline cartilage has a dual role:  
  1.  It acts like a shock absorber, because of its stiffness and elasticity. 
  2. It provides a lubricated surface for movable joints. 
   The lubrication ﬂuid (hyaluronic acid, immunoglobulins, lysosomal enzymes, 
collagenase in particular, and glycoproteins) is produced by the synovial lining 
of the capsule of the joint. 
•   The analysis of the synovial ﬂuid is valuable in the diagnosis of joint 
disease.

of  a  protein-secreting  cell  (well-developed  RER 
and Golgi apparatus, and large nucleolus) and store 
lipids and glycogen in the cytoplasm. Chondrocytes  
are  coated  by  a  pericellular  matrix,  surrounded 
by  the  territorial  and  interterritorial  matrices, 
respectively.  A  lacunar  rim  separates  the  cell  from 
the territorial matrix. 

The  surface  of  hyaline  cartilage  is  covered  by 
the  perichondrium,  a  ﬁbrocellular  layer  that  is 
continuous  with  the  periosteal  cover  of  the  bone 
and  that  blends  into  the  surrounding  connective 
tissue. Articular cartilage lacks a perichondrium. 

The  perichondrium  consists  of  two  layers  (see 

Figure 4-18): 

1.  An  outer  ﬁbrous  layer,  which  contains 
ﬁbroblasts producing bundles of type I collagen and 
elastin.

2.  An  inner  layer,  called  the  chondrogenic 
layer,  formed  by  elongated  chondrocytes  aligned 
tangentially to the perichondrium of the cartilage. 

The ECM contains hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans 
(rich in the GAGs chondroitin sulfate and keratan 
sulfate) and a high water content (70% to 80% of 
its weight). Aggrecan is a large proteoglycan (about 
2500  kd)  characteristic  of  cartilage.  It  provides  a 
hydrated gel-like structure that facilitates the load-
bearing properties of cartilage.

A 

The transcription factor Sox9 (for sex determining 
region  Y–box  9)  is  required  for  the  expression  of 
cartilage-speciﬁc  ECM  components  such  as  type 
II  collagen  and  the  proteoglycan  aggrecan.  Sox9 
activates the expression of the COL2A1 gene. 
lack  of  Sox9  expression  prevents 

the 
chondrogenic layer to differentiate into chondrocytes 
(see  Box  4-I).  Mutations  in  the  Sox9  gene  cause 
the  rare  and  severe  dwarﬁsm  called  campomelic 
dysplasia (see Figure 4-18). We come back to Sox9 
to stress its role of enabling mesenchymal stem cells 
to become preosteoblasts.

The  structure  of  the  elastic  cartilage  is  similar 
to  that  of  hyaline  cartilage  except  that  the  ECM 
contains  abundant  elastic  ﬁbers  synthesized  by 
chondrocytes. Elastic cartilage predominates in the 
auricle  of  the  external  ear,  a  major  portion  of  the 
epiglottis and some of the laryngeal cartilages. The 
specialized  matrix  of  the  cartilage  has  remarkable 
ﬂexibility and the ability to regain its original shape 
after deformation. 

Unlike hyaline cartilage, ﬁbrocartilage is opaque, 
the matrix contains type I collagen ﬁbers, the ECM 
has a low concentration of proteoglycans and water 
and it lacks a perichondrium.

Box 4-I  |  Sox9 transcription factor

•  Genes encoding proteins that turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) other 
genes are called transcription factors. Many transcription factors have com-
mon DNA-binding domains and can also activate or repress a single target 
gene as well as other genes (a cascade effect). Therefore, mutations affecting 
genes encoding transcription factor have pleiotropic effects (Greek pleion, 
more; trope, a turning toward). 
•  Examples of transcription factor genes include homeobox-containing genes, 
high mobility group (HMG)-box–containing genes, and the T-box family. 
•  The HMG domain of Sox proteins can bend DNA, and facilitate the interaction 
of enhancers with a distantly located promoter region of a target gene.  
•  Several Sox genes act in different developmental pathways. For example, 
Sox9 protein is expressed in the gonadal ridges of both genders but is up-
regulated in males and down-regulated in females before gonadal differentia-
tion. Sox9 also regulates chondrogenesis and osteogenesis and the expression 
of type II collagen by chondroblasts. Mutations of the Sox9 gene cause skeletal 
defects (campomelic dysplasia), and sex reversal (XY females). 

Bone
Bone  is  a  rigid  inﬂexible  connective  tissue  in 
which  the  ECM  has  become  impregnated  with 
salts of calcium and phosphate by a process called 
mineralization.  Bone  is  highly  vascularized  and 
metabolically very active.

The functions of bone are:
1.  Support  and  protection  of  the  body  and  its 

organs.  

2. A reservoir for calcium and phosphate ions. 

Macroscopic structure of mature bone
Two forms of bone can be distinguished based on 
the gross appearance (Figure 4-20), :

1. Compact or dense bone. 
2. Spongy, trabecular or cancellous bone.  
Compact  bone  appears  as  a  solid  mass.  Spongy

Articular surface

bone  consists  of  a  network  of  bony  spicules  or 
trabeculae delimiting spaces occupied by the bone 
marrow.

In  long  bones,  such  as  the  femur,  the  shaft  or 
diaphysis  consists  of  compact    bone  forming  a 
hollow cylinder with a central marrow space, called 
the medullary or marrow cavity. 

The  ends  of  the  long  bones,  called  epiphyses, 
consist  of  spongy  bone  covered  by  a  thin  layer  of 
compact bone. 

In the growing individual, epiphyses are separated 
from  the  diaphysis  by  a  cartilaginous  epiphyseal 
plate, connected to the diaphysis by spongy bone. A 
tapering transitional region, called the metaphysis, 
connects the epiphysis and the diaphysis. Both the 
epiphyseal plate and adjacent spongy bone represent 
the  growth  zone,  responsible  for    the  increase  in 
length of the growing bone. 

The  articular  surfaces,  at  the  ends  of  the  long 
bones, are covered by hyaline cartilage, the articular 
cartilage.  Except  on  the  articular  surfaces  and  at 
the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments, most 
bones  are  surrounded  by  the  periosteum,  a  layer 
of  specialized  connective  tissue  with  osteogenic 
potential. 

The marrow wall of the diaphysis, the endosteum, 
and  the  spaces  within  spongy  bone  are  lined  by 
osteoprogenitor cells, with osteogenic potential.

Bone

Microscopic structure of mature bone
Two types of bone are identiﬁed on the basis of the 
microscopic  three-dimensional  arrangement  of  the 
collagen ﬁbers: 

1.  Lamellar  or  compact  bone,  typical  of  the 
mature  bone,  displays  a  regular  alignment  of 
collagen  ﬁbers.  This  bone  is  mechanically  strong 
and forms slowly.

2.  Woven  bone,  observed  in  the  developing 
bone,  is  characterized  by  an  irregular  alignment 
of collagen ﬁbers. This bone is mechanically weak, 
is  formed  rapidly  and  is  then  replaced  by  lamellar 
bone. Woven bone is produced during the repair of 
a bone fracture.

The  lamellar  bone  consists  of  lamellae,  largely 
composed of bone matrix, a mineralized substance 
deposited in layers or lamellae, and osteocytes, each 
one occupying  a cavity or lacuna with radiating and 
branching canaliculi that penetrate the lamellae of 
adjacent lacunae. 

The lamellar bone displays four distinct patterns 

(Figure 4-21):

  1.  The  osteons  or  haversian  systems,  formed 
by  concentrically  arranged 
lamellae  around  a 
longitudinal  vascular  channel.  About  4  to  20 
lamellae  are  concentrically  arranged  around  the 
haversian canal.

2.  The  interstitial  lamellae,  observed  between 
osteons  and  separated  from  them  by  a  thin  layer 
known as the cement line. 

3. The outer circumferential lamellae, visualized 
at the external surface of the compact bone under 
the periosteum. 

4.  The  inner  circumferential  lamellae,  seen  on 

the internal surface subjacent to the endosteum. 

The vascular channels in compact bone have two 
orientations with respect to the lamellar structures: 
  1.  The  longitudinal  haversian  canal,  housing
capillaries and postcapillary venules in the center of 
the osteon (Figures 4-21 to 4-23). 

2. The  transverse  or  oblique Volkmann’s  canals, 
connecting  haversian  canals  with  one  another, 
containing  blood  vessels  derived  from  the  bone 
marrow and some from the periosteum. 

Periosteum and endosteum
During  embryonic  and  postnatal  growth,  the 
periosteum consists of:

inner 

1.  An 

layer  of  preosteoblasts 

(or 
osteoprogenitor cells), in direct contact with bone. 
In  the  adult,  the  periosteum  contains  quiescent 
connective  tissue  cells  that  retain  their  osteogenic 
potential  in  case  of  bone  injury  and  repair.  The 
inner layer is the osteogenic layer (see Figure 4-21). 
2.  An  outer  layer  rich  in  blood  vessels,  some 
of  them  entering  Volkmann’s  canals,  and  thick 
anchoring  collagen  ﬁbers,  called  Sharpey’s  ﬁbers,

osteoprogenitor cells.

Spongy bone (also called 
trabecular or cancellous spongy 
bone). 
   Spongy bone is lamellar but 
usually not haversian.
The cavities of the spongy bone 
are continuous with the bone 
marrow cavity of the diaphysis.

The endosteum consists of osteoprogenitor cells and 
reticular fibers. In the adult, these cells can become 
osteoblasts during conditions requiring bone repair, such 
as bone fracture.

in a direction parallel to the bone shaft.

The  endosteum  covers  the  spongy  walls  and 
extends into all the cavities of the bone, including 
the haversian and Volkmann’s canals. It consists of

bone marrow  and connective tissue ﬁbers. 

As  discussed

Hematopoiesis,  preosteoblasts  and  osteoblasts  in

cell proliferation and maturation.

The  organic  component  contains 

type  I 
collagen  ﬁbers  (90%);  proteoglycans,  enriched  in 
chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronic 
acid, and noncollagenous proteins. 

The  inorganic  component  of  the  bone  is 
represented  predominantly  by  deposits  of  calcium 
phosphate  with  the  crystalline  characteristics  of 
hydroxyapatite. The  crystals  are  distributed  along 
the  length  of  collagen  ﬁbers  through  an  assembly 
process assisted by noncollagenous proteins. 

Type  I  collagen  is  the  predominant  protein  of 
the bone matrix. In mature lamellar bone, collagen 
ﬁbers  have  a  highly  ordered  arrangement  with 
changing  orientations  with  respect  to  the  axis  of 
the haversian canal in successive concentric lamellae 
(see Figure 4-21). 

Noncollagenous  matrix  proteins  synthesized 
by  osteoblasts  and  with  unique  properties  in 
the  mineralization  of  bone  include  osteocalcin, 
osteopontin,    and  osteonectin.  The  synthesis  of 
osteocalcin  (5.8  kd)  and  osteopontin  (44  kd;  also 
known  as  bone  sialoprotein  I)  increases  following 

stimulation  with  the  active  vitamin  D  metabolite, 
1(cid:95),25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Vitamin K induces 
amino  acid  carboxylation  of  osteocalcin  to  enable 
its  calcium  binding  properties.  Osteopontin 
participates in the anchoring of osteoclast to bone 
by  the  formation  of  a  sealing  zone  before  bone 
resorption.  Osteonectin  (32  kd)  binds  to  type  I 
collagen and hydroxyapatite.

Osteocalcin,  osteopontin,  and  osteonectin  are 
not  exclusively  bone  effectors.  For  example, 
undercarboxylated osteocalcin (the hormone form) 
stimulates the proliferation and insulin secretion by 
B cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. 

We discuss later that osteoblasts regulate osteoclast 
differentiation  by  osteoprotegerin,  RANKL,  and 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Cellular components of bone
Bone contains cells of two different lineages: 
1. The osteoblast, of mesenchymal origin.
2.  The  osteoclast,  derived  from  a  monocyte 

precursor.

The osteoblast  
Osteoblasts are epithelial-like cells with cuboidal or 
columnar shapes, forming a monolayer covering all 
sites of active bone formation. 

Osteoblasts  are  highly  polarized  cells:  they 
deposit osteoid, the nonmineralized organic matrix 
of  the  bone,  along  the  osteoblast-bone  interface. 

Osteoblasts  initiate  and  control  the  mineralization 
of the osteoid.

In  electron  micrographs,  osteoblasts  display  the 
typical features of cells actively engaged in protein 
synthesis, glycosylation, and secretion. Their speciﬁc 
products  include  type  I  collagen,  osteocalcin, 
osteopontin,  and  osteonectin  as  well  as  several

Mineralized matrix

Osteoid

Osteoblasts derive from osteoprogenitor cells. Osteocytes are the most 
mature or terminally differentiated cells of the osteoblastic lineage.
   Osteoblasts synthesize the organic matrix of bone, the osteoid, and 
control the mineralization of the matrix. 
    Alkaline phosphatase is an ectoenzyme (a cell surface protein) that 
hydrolyzes monophosphate esters at high pH. This enzyme disappears 
when the osteoblast ceases protein synthesis and becomes embedded 
in the mineralized bone matrix as an osteocyte.
    Vitamin D3 (1(cid:95),25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) regulates the expression 
of osteocalcin, a protein with high binding affinity for hydroxyapatite.
   Growth hormone stimulates the production of IGF-1 in 
hepatocytes. IGF-1 stimulates the growth of long bones at the level of 
the epiphyseal plates.
   The major protein products of an osteoblast are:
   1. Type 1 collagen.  Osteoid consists of type I collagen and 
proteoglycans. As a typical protein-producing cell, the osteoblast has a 
well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum.
    2. Several noncollagenous proteins. They include: RANKL, the 
ligand for receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa ((cid:103)) B 
(RANK), present in osteoclast precursor cells; osteocalcin, required for 
bone mineralization; osteopontin, to mediate the formation of the 
osteoclast sealing zone; and osteoprotegerin, a RANKL-binding 
“decoy” protein. 

Prominent rough 

endoplasmic reticulum 

Osteoblasts 

Osteoblasts produce multiple hematopoietic 
cytokines, including granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor, macrophage-colony

colony stimulating factor and interleukins.

 Osteoblasts give a strong cytochemical reaction 
for alkaline phosphatase that disappears when the 
cells become embedded in the matrix as osteocytes. 
When bone formation is completed, osteoblasts 
ﬂatten out and transform into osteocytes embedded 
in the mineralized bone matrix. 

Osteocytes  are  highly  branched  cells  with  their 
body occupying small spaces, or lacunae, between 
lamellae.  Small  channels,  the  canaliculi,  course 
through the lamellae and interconnect neighboring 
lacunae.  Cell  processes  of  adjacent  osteocytes  are 
found within canaliculi. They are connected to each 

other by gap junctions (see Figure 4-23).  

Nutrient  materials  diffuse  from  a  blood  vessel 
within  the  haversian  canal  through  the  canaliculi 
into the lacunae. As you can see, the delicate network 
of  osteocytes  depends  not  only  on  intercellular 
communication across gap junctions but also on the 
mobilization  of  nutrients  and  signaling  molecules 
along the extracellular environment of the canaliculi 
extending from lacuna to lacuna. 

The life of an osteocyte depends on this nutrient 
diffusion  process  and  the  life  of  the  bone  matrix 
depends  on  the  osteocyte.  Osteocytes  can  remain 
alive for years provided that vascularization is steady.

Pathology:  Transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation 

Osteoblasts derive from a mesenchymal stem cell that gives rise 
to muscle cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, and chondroblasts. 
    Three osteoblast specific genes encoding transcription 
factors, control the differentiation of the osteoblast progeny: (1)  
Sox9 (for sex determining region Y–box 9), determines the 
differentiation of the mesenchymal progenitor into preosteoblasts 
and chondroblasts; (2) Runx2 (for Runt homeodomain protein 2),  
induces the differentiation of the mitotically-active preosteoblasts 
into post-mitotic osteoblasts and, together with Osx, controls the 
expression of osteocalcin. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin is a 
specific secretory protein that enters the blood circulation to 
possibly stimulate insulin secretion by pancreatic (cid:96) cells and 
testosterone production by Leydig cells. (3) Osterix (Osx), 
encoding a zinc finger transcription factor, is required for the 

differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes and the function of 
osteocytes and chondroblasts.  
  Runx2-deficient mice have a skeleton consisting of cartilage 
without any indication of osteoblast differentiation represented by 
bone formation and mineralization. In addition, because osteoblasts 
regulate the formation of osteoclasts, Runx2-deficient mice lack 
osteoclasts. 
   Patients with cleidocranial dysplasia (hypoplastic clavicles and 
delayed ossification of sutures of certain skull bones) have a Runx2 
type of gene mutation. 
    A loss of Osx expression affects osteoblast differentiation, 
resulting in ectopic cartilage formation under the perichondrium at 
the diaphysis, where the bone collar develops. Osx-deficient 
patients have "brittle bone disease" (osteogenesis imperfecta).

Regulation of Sox9, Runx2 and Osx transcription factor expression by cell signaling pathways

The expression of the transcription factors Sox9, Runx2 and Osx is regulated by several cell 
signaling pathways: (1) Hedgehog signaling, mediated by Indian hedgehog protein, is required 
for the differentiation of Runx2+/Osx+ osteoblasts.  (2) Notch signaling inhibits osteoblast 
differentiation by down regulation of Osx activation. (3) Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin signaling stimulates 
osteoblast differentiation by Osx activation. (4) Bone morphogenetic protein signaling promotes 
the transition of Runx2+ preosteoblasts to Runx2+/Osx+ osteoblast by enhancing the expression 
of Runx2 and Osx. (4) Fibroblast growth factor signaling regulates Runx2+ preosteoblast 
proliferation and Runx2+/Osx+ osteoblast differentiation. Review in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling, 
the details of the indicated cell signaling pathways.

Pathology: Differentiation of the preosteoblast to 
osteoblast to osteocyte  
Mesenchyme  stem  cells  are  the  precursors  of 
preosteoblasts  as  well  as  ﬁbroblasts,  adipocytes, 
muscle  cells,  and  chondroblasts.  Mitotically-active 
preosteoblasts give rise to post-mitotic osteoblasts. 
Then,  a  subset  of    osteoblasts  differentiate  into 
osteocytes, trapped within the mineralized osteoid. 

Other osteoblasts undergo apoptosis or become just 
quiescent bone-lining cells (Figure 4-25).

Sox9 triggers the differentiation of mesenchymal 
stem cells into preosteoblasts (see Box 4-I and Figure 
4-25).  The  differentiation  of  preosteoblasts  into 
osteoblasts is controlled by the transcription factors 
Runx2  (for  Runt  homeodomain  protein  2)  and 
Osterix (Osx).

Box 4-J  |  How osteocytes differentiate: Highlights to remember

•   The preosteoblast to osteoblast to osteocyte differentiation process requires 
three transcription factors: Sox9,  Runx2, and Osterix (Osx) produced by the 
osteoblast progeny. 
•   We have already seen that chondrogenesis involves the transcription factor 
Sox9. We discuss in Chapter 5, Osteogenesis, that Runx2 controls the conver-
sion of proliferating chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes, an event that 
is prevented by Sox9. 
•   The transcription factors Sox9, Runx2, and Osx play critical roles in the 
development of the skeleton. 
•   Mutations in genes encoding these transcription factors are the genetic 
basis of skeletal diseases. For example, a total lack of expression of the Runx2 
gene determines that the entire skeleton consists only of cartilage.

The Runx2 gene is the earliest and most speciﬁc 
indicator  of  osteogenesis.  Together  with  the  Osx 
transcription factor gene, the Runx2 gene modulate 
the  expression  of    osteocalcin,  a  speciﬁc  secretory 
protein  expressed  by  postmitotic  osteoblasts. 
Osteocalcin 
is  a  biochemical  marker  of  the 
osteogenesis process.

The  expression  of  Runx2  and  Osx  genes  is 
regulated  by  hedgehog  (HH),  Notch,  Wn(cid:111)/b-
catenin,  bone  morphogenetic  protein  (BMP)  and 
ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways 
(see Figure 4-25).  

Runx2-deﬁcient mice develop to term and have a 
skeleton consisting of cartilage (see Box 4-J). There 
is  no  indication  of  osteoblast  differentiation  or 
bone formation in these mice. In addition, Runx2-
deﬁcient  mice  lack  osteoclasts.  As  we  will  discuss 
soon, osteoblasts produce proteins that regulate the 
formation of osteoclasts. 

Consistent with the skeletal observations in the 
Runx2-deﬁcient  mice  is  a  condition  in  humans 
known  as  cleidocranial  dysplasia  (CCD).  CCD 
is  characterized  by  hypoplastic  clavicles,  delayed 
ossiﬁcation  of  sutures  of  certain  skull  bones,  and 
mutations in the Runx2 gene. 

Leptin,  a  peptide  synthesized  by  adipocytes 
with  binding  afﬁnity  to  its  receptor    in  the 
hypothalamus, negatively regulates bone formation 
by a central mechanism. The leptin-hypothalamic 
control  mechanism  inhibits  the  production  and 
release of serotonin. Mice deﬁcient in leptin or its 
receptor have a considerably higher bone mass than 
wild-type  mice.  In  fact,  patients  with  generalized 
lipodystrophy (absence of adipocytes and white fat) 
exhibit  osteosclerosis  (increased  bone  hardening) 
and accelerated bone growth.
 
The osteoclast 
Osteoclasts  do  not  belong  to  the  mesenchyme 
stem  cell  lineage.  Instead,  osteoclasts  derive  from 
monocyte precursors originated in bone marrow.

Monocytes reach the bone through the blood

circulation and fuse into multinucleated cells with 
as many as 30 nuclei to form osteoclasts by a process 
regulated by osteoblasts (see Osteoclastogenesis ).

Osteoclasts have three essential functions: 
1.  Bone  remodeling  by  the  process  of  bone 
turnover.  This  process  involves  removal  of  bone 
matrix  at  several  sites,  followed  by  its  replacement 
with new bone by osteoblasts.

2. Proper shaping of the bones.
3. Extension  of  the  medullary  spaces  to  enable 

hematopoiesis.

The  osteoclast  is  a  large  (up  to  100  (cid:43)m  in 
diameter)  and  highly  polarized  cell  that  occupies 
a  shallow  concavity  called  Howship’s  lacuna  or 
the  subosteoclastic  acidic  compartment  (Figures 
4-26  and  4-27).  Osteoclasts  are  found  in  cortical 
(compact)  bone,  within  the  haversian  canals,  and 
on the surfaces of trabeculae of cancellous (spongy) 
bone.

After  attachment  to  the  target  bone  matrix, 
osteoclasts generate a secluded acidic compartment 
required 
acidic 
compartment consists of two essential components:
1.  The  rufﬂed  border,  a  plasma  membrane 
specialization  with  many  folds  producing  a  large 
surface area for several important functional events: 
the release of  H+ and lysosomal protease cathepsin 
K  and  matrix  metalloproteinase-9  (MMP-9) 
and  the  internalization  of  degraded  bone  matrix 
products  into  coated  vesicles  and  vacuoles  for 
material elimination. Remember that osteoclasts are 
an example of a cell type  with secretory lysosomes 
represented  by  the  release  of  cathepsin  K  into  the 
subosteoclastic compartment. 

2.  The  sealing  zone  is  assembled  around  the 
apical circumference of the osteoclast to seal off the 
bone resorption lacuna. The sealing zone consists of 
plasma  membrane  associated  with  actin  ﬁlaments 
and (cid:95)v(cid:96)3 integrin and the protein osteopontin. 

The  cytoplasm  of  the  osteoclast  is  very  rich  in 
mitochondria, acidiﬁed vesicles and coated vesicles. 
The membrane of the acidiﬁed vesicles contains H+-
ATPase;  mitochondria  are  the  source  of  adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to drive the H+-ATPase pumps 
required for the acidiﬁcation of the subosteoclastic 
compartment  for  the  subsequent  activation  of 
cathepsin K and MMP-9. 

Bone  resorption  involves  ﬁrst  the  dissolution

       Around the circumference of the ruffled

border, where the the plasma membrane is 
closely applied to the bone, actin filaments 
accumulate to form a sealing zone, together 
with (cid:95)v(cid:96)3 integrin and osteopontin.
       A chloride channel prevents an excessive

rise of intracellular pH.
       Bicarbonate (HCO3–) is exchanged for 
3
chloride (Cl–), which is then transported by the 
chloride channel (located in the ruffled 
membrane) to Howship's lacuna. A 
bicarbonate-chloride exchanger ensures the 
maintenance of cytoplasmic electroneutrality.
      Carbonic anhydrase II generates protons

(H+) from CO2 and H2O. H+ is released into 
Howship's lacuna by an H+-ATPase pump to 
create an acidic environment (pH ~4.5) for 
solubilizing mineralized bone.

Howship's lacuna or 

subosteoclastic compartment 

of Howship’s lacuna by osteoclasts is similar to the 
production of HCl by parietal cells in the stomach 
(see Chapter 15, Upper Digestive Segment).  

    When  the  osteoclast  is  inactive,  the  rufﬂed 
border  disappears  and  the  osteoclast  enters  into  a 
resting phase.  Osteoclasts are transiently active in 
response to a metabolic demand for the mobilization 

of calcium from bone into blood. Osteoclast activity 
is  directly  regulated  by  calcitonin  (synthesized  by 
C  cells  of  the  thyroid  follicle),  vitamin  D3,  and 
regulatory molecules produced by osteoblasts.

bone marrow, reaches an area of 
bone formation and remodeling. A 
receptor for M-CSF is expressed on 
its surface. 

       The monocyte becomes a

macrophage. M-CSF ligand binds 
to the M-CSF receptor and induces 
the expression of RANK 
(transmembrane receptor for 
activation of nuclear factor kappa B) 
for its ligand (RANKL) expressed 
on the surface of osteoblasts.

RANKL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)  superfamily.  RANKL  binds  to  RANK 
receptor on the surface of the osteoclast precursor. 
RANKL  binding  determines  RANK  trimerization 
and the recruitment of an adaptor molecule called 
TRAF6  (for  TNF  receptor–associated  factor  6). 
TRAF6 stimulates a downstream signaling cascade, 
including the nuclear relocation of two transcription 
factors:  NF-(cid:103)B  and  NFATc1  (for  nuclear  factor–
activated  T  cells  c1).  In  the  nucleus,  these  two

transcription  factors  activate  genes  triggering  the

Osteoblasts 

synthesize 

osteoprotegerin, 

a 
protein  with  high  binding  afﬁnity  for  RANKL. 
Osteoprotegerin    is  a  soluble  “decoy”  protein  that 
binds  to  RANKL  and  prevents  RANK-RANKL 
interaction.  By  this  mechanism,  osteoprotegerin 
modulates the osteoclastogenic process.  

Parathyroid hormone stimulates the expression of 
RANKL so the pool of RANKL increases relative to 
osteoprotegerin. An excess of parathyroid hormone 
enhances osteoclastogenesis, resulting in an elevation 
of calcium levels in blood caused by increased bone 
resorption  (see  Chapter  19,  Endocrine  System). 
Denosumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody  to  RANKL, 
functions like osteoprotegerin, thus preventing bone 
loss  caused  by  excessive  osteoclast  differentiation 
and activity stimulated by parathyroid hormone.

in  osteoporosis 

The  major 

Pathology: Osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, and 
osteomalacia
Osteoporosis (Greek osteon, bone; poros, pore; osis, 
condition) is deﬁned as the loss of bone mass leading 
to bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. 
is 

the 
deﬁciency  of  the  sex  steroid  estrogen  that  occurs 
in  postmenopausal  women.  In  this  condition,  the 
amount of reabsorbed old bone, due to an increase 
in the number of osteoclasts, exceeds the amount of 
formed new bone. This  accelerated turnover state 
can  be  reversed  by  estrogen  therapy  and  calcium 
and vitamin D supplementation. Osteoporosis and 
osteoporotic fractures are also observed in men.

Osteoporosis  is  asymptomatic  until  it  produces 
skeletal  deformity  and  bone  fractures  (typically  in 
the spine, hip and wrist). The vertebral bones are 
predominantly  trabecular  bone  surrounded  by  a 
thin rim of compact bone. Therefore, they may be 
crushed or may wedge anteriorly, resulting in pain 
and in a reduction in height. Elderly persons with 
osteoporosis may have a hip fracture when they fall. 

Bisphosphonate  drugs  decrease 

fracture  by 
inhibiting  bone  resorption  and  increasing  bone 
mass.  Whole  body  mechanical  vibrations  (WBD)
treatment  stimulates  bone  formation  mediated  by 
direct osteocyte signaling effects and indirect bone 
stimulation through skeletal muscle activation.

WBD therapy consists in the patient standing on a 
motorized oscillating platform that produces vertical 
accelerations,  which  are  transmitted  from  the  feet 
to  muscles  and  bones  to  improve  the  structure  of 
trabecular structure and the thickness of the cortical 
bone. 

The diagnosis of osteoporosis is made radiologically 
or,  preferentially,  by  measuring  bone  density  by 
dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry  (DEXA).  DEXA 
measures photon absorption from an x-ray source to 
estimate the amount of bone mineral content.

The  realization  that  RANKL  plays  a  major 
contribution in osteoclast development and in bone 
resorptive  activity  stimulated  the  development  of 
pharmaceutical agents to arrest skeletal disorders.  

A  monoclonal  antibody  to  RANKL,  called 
denosumab (Amgen), functions like osteoprotegerin. 
The antibody has been administered subcutaneously 
every  3  months  for  1  year  in  postmenopausal 
women  with  severe  osteoporosis  determined  by 
low  bone  mineral  density  detected  by  DEXA.  
Denosumab mimics the function of osteoprotegerin 
and  decreases  bone  resorption,  as  determined  by 
measuring  in  urine  and  serum  of  bone-collagen 
degradation  products  and  increased  bone  mineral 
density at 1 year. A concern with denosumab anti-
RANKL  treatment  is  the  expression  of  RANKL-
osteoprotegerin  in  cells  of  the  immune  system 
(dendritic cells and B and T cells). 

Osteopetrosis  (Greek  osteon,  bone;  petra,  stone; 
osis,  condition)  is  a  clinical  syndrome  caused  by  a 
failure  of  osteoclasts  to  remodel  bone.  Their  role 
was established by studies of the op/op mouse, which 
does not express M-CSF, lacks osteoclasts, and has 
an  increase  in  bone  mass  as  in  osteopetrosis.  For 
comparison,  osteosclerosis  is  an  increase  in  bone 
mass due to enhanced osteoblastic activity.  

Autosomal  recessive  osteopetrosis  (ARO),  the 
most severe and life threatening form of the disorder, 
becomes apparent in early infancy. ARO is caused by 
a  deﬁciency  of  the  carbonic  anhydrase  II  enzyme, 
associated  with  renal  tubular  acidosis  and  cerebral 
calciﬁcations.    Severe  anemia  and  infections  are 
related to bone marrow failure due to the occlusion 
of  marrow  spaces.  Compression  of  cranial  nerves 
determines hearing and vision loss and paralysis of 
facial muscles.

Intermediate  autosomal  osteopetrosis  (IAO)  
can  have  either  an  autosomal  dominant  or  an 
autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Detected 

Osteoclastogenesis

in  childhood,  this  form  of  osteopetrosis  does  not 
display severe bone marrow abnormalities although 
anemia and bone fracture, in addition to abnormal 
organ calciﬁcations, are observed.

Autosomal  dominant  osteopetrosis  (ADO), 
also  called  Albers-Schönberg  disease,  is  the  most 
prevalent  and  mildest  type  of  the  disorder  when 
compared to ARO and IAO. Multiple bone factures 
and  scoliosis  (abnormal  curvature  of  the  spine) 
are  characteristic.  Because  of    its  relatively  benign 
clinical condition, many patients are asymptomatic 
and the condition is only detected by coincidental 
radiographic examination. 

Mutations  of  the  CLCN7  (chloride  channel 
voltage sensitive 7) gene are responsible for about 
75% of cases of ADO. Note in Figure 4-26 that the 
chloride channel contributes to the transport of Cl– 
to  the  subosteoclastic  reabsorption  compartment 
so an acidic pH can be achieved for effective bone 
resorption.  Also,  note  that  carbonic  anhydrase  II 
plays an essential role in osteoclast-mediated bone 
resorption.

Osteomalacia  (Greek  osteon,  bone;  malakia, 
softness) is  a disease characterized by  a progressive 
softening  and  bending  of  the  bones.  Softening 
occurs because of  a defect in the mineralization of 
the osteoid due to lack of vitamin D or renal tubular 
dysfunction  (see  Chapter  14,  Urinary  System).  In 
the  young,  a  defect  in  mineralization  of  cartilage 
in the growth plate (see Chapter 5, Osteogenesis), 
causes a defect called rickets (juvenile osteomalacia).
  Osteomalacia  can  result  from  a  deﬁciency  of 
vitamin  D  (for  example,  intestinal  malabsorption) 
or  heritable  disorders  of  vitamin  D  activation  (for 
example, renal 1(cid:95)-hydroxylase deﬁciency in which 
calciferol  is  not  converted  to  the  active  form  of 
vitamin D, calcitriol; see vitamin D in Chapter 19, 
Endocrine System). 
Although  bone 

fractures  are  a  common 
characteristic  in  patients  with  osteomalacia  and 
osteoporosis, note that there is defective osteogenesis 
in osteomalacia in contrast to bone weakening of a 
previous  normal  osteogenesis  process  in  patients 
with osteoporosis. 

Essential concepts

Connective Tissue

• Connective tissue provides support, or 
stroma, to the functional component, or paren-
chyma, of tissues. The functions of connective 
tissue include the storage of metabolites, im-
mune and inﬂammatory responses and tissue 
repair after injury.
  Connective tissue consists of thee basic com-
ponents: cells, ﬁbers and extracellular matrix 
(called ground substance). The proportion of 
these three components contributes to the 
classiﬁcation of connective tissue. 
  Connective tissue can be classiﬁed into three 
major groups: 
  (1) Embryonic connective tissue.
  (2) Adult connective tissue.
  (3) Special connective tissue (including 
adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and hemato-
poietic tissue). 
  The embryonic connective tissue, or mesen-
chyme, consists predominantly of extracellular 
matrix. The umbilical cord contains this type of 
connective tissue, also called mucoid connec-
tive tissue or Wharton’s jelly.
  The adult connective tissue can be subclas-
siﬁed as:
  (1) Loose or areolar connective tissue (more 
cells than ﬁbers, found in the mesentery or 
lamina propria of mucosae).
  (2) Dense connective tissue (more collagen 
ﬁbers, arranged in bundles, than cells).  The 
latter is subdivided into two categories: 
  • Dense irregular connective tissue (with a 
random orientation of collagen bundles, found 
in the dermis of the skin).
  • Dense regular connective tissue (with an 
orderly orientation of collagen bundles, found 
in tendon). 

  An extension of the adult connective tissue 
classiﬁcation is based on which ﬁbers pre-
dominate. Reticular connective tissue contains 
abundant reticular ﬁbers (type III collagen). 
Elastic connective tissue, found in the form of 
sheets or laminae in the wall of the aorta, is 
rich in elastic ﬁbers.

• There are two major classes of cells in the 
connective tissue: 
  (1) The resident ﬁbroblasts.
  (2) The immigrant macrophages, mast cells 
and plasma cells.
  The ﬁbroblast synthesizes the precursor mol-
ecules of various types of collagens and elastin 
and proteoglycans. 
  Collagen synthesis proceeds in an orderly 
sequence. Procollagen, the initial collagen 
precursor which contains hydroxyproline and 
hydroxylysine, is secreted by ﬁbroblasts in the 
form of a triple helix ﬂanked by nonhelical 
domains. Procollagen peptidase cleaves the 
nonhelical domains and procollagen becomes 
tropocollagen.  Tropocollagen molecules 
self-assemble in a staggered array in the pres-
ence of lysyl oxidase to form a cross-banded 
collagen ﬁbril.  Side-by-side linking of collagen 
ﬁbrils, a process mediated by proteoglycans 
and a form of collagen with interrupted triple 
helices (called FACIT), results in the assembly 
of collagen ﬁbers. What you see in the light 
microscope are bundles of collagen ﬁbers. 
  Keep In mind that not only ﬁbroblasts can 
produce collagens. Osteoblasts, chondroblasts, 
odontoblasts and smooth muscle cells can 
also synthesize collagens. Even epithelial cells 
can synthesize type IV collagen. You have 

already seen that the basement membrane 
contains type IV collagen in the basal lamina 
and type III collagen in the reticular lamina.
   Defects in the processing of procollagen 
and tropocollagen and the assembly of 
collagen ﬁbrils give rise to variations of the 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, characterized by 
hyperelasticity of the skin and hypermobility 
of the joints.
  Elastin, the precursor of elastic ﬁbers, is 
also synthesized and processed sequentially. 
Fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells secrete 
desmosine- and isodesmosine-containing pro-
elastin, which is partially cleaved to give rise to 
tropoelastin. These cells also produce ﬁbrillin 
1 and 2 and ﬁbulin 1. Tropoelastin, ﬁbrillins 
and ﬁbulin 1 assemble into elastic ﬁbers that 
aggregate to form bundles of elastic ﬁbers.
  A defect in ﬁbrillin 1 affects the assembly of 
mature elastic ﬁbers, a characteristic of Marfan 
syndrome. 
  Macrophages derive from monocytes 
produced in the bone marrow. A typical prop-
erty of macrophages is phagocytosis. Their 
function in connective tissue is the turnover 
of ﬁbers and extracellular matrix and, most 
important, the presentation of antigens to 
lymphocytes as an essential step of immune 
and inﬂammatory reactions.
  Mast cells also originate in the bone mar-
row from precursors expressing  c-kit receptor, 
stem cell factor (a c-kit receptor ligand) and 
Fc(cid:161)RI, a receptor for immunoglobulin E.    
  There are two populations of mast cells: 
  (1) Connective tissue mast cells (CTMCs).  
  (2) Mucosa mast cells (MMCs). 
   Mast cells acquire metachromatic granules

in the connective tissue and mucosa, which 
stain with a color that is different from the col-
or of the dye. The granules contain vasoactive 
mediators (histamine, heparin, and chemotac-
tic mediators), chymases and other proteases. 
Granules are released, by a process called 
degranulation, when a speciﬁc antigen (or al-
lergen) dimerizes two adjacent IgE molecules 
anchored to Fc(cid:161)RI receptors and cytosolic 
calcium is released from intracellular storage 
sites. Leukotrienes are vasoactive agents not 
present in granules; they are metabolites of 
the plasma membrane–associated arachidonic 
acid. Like most vasoactive agents, they induce 
an increase in vascular permeability leading to 
edema.
  Mast cells and basophils circulating in blood 
derive from the same progenitor in the bone 
marrow.
  Mast cells play a role in allergic hypersensitiv-
ity reactions associated with asthma, hay fever, 
and eczema. 
  Plasma cells derive from the differentiation 
of B lymphocytes (B cells). Three character-
istics deﬁne the structure of a plasma cell: a 
well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, 
an extensive Golgi apparatus, and a prominent 
nucleolus. These features deﬁne the plasma 
cell as an actively protein-producing cell, 
whose main product are immunoglobulins. 

  The extracellular matrix is a combination of 
collagens, noncollagenous glycoproteins, and 
proteoglycans. 
  Proteoglycan aggregates are the major 

components. Each proteoglycan consists of a 
core protein attached to a linear hyaluronan 
molecule by a linker protein. Attached to the 
core protein are numerous glycosaminoglycan 
chains (keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate and 
chondroitin sulfate). The extracellular matrix 
is maintained by a balance of matrix metal-
loproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors 
of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are 
zinc-dependent proteases, which include col-
lagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, matrilysin 
and membrane-type MMPs.

• Tumor invasion of the connective tissue. 
Malignant cells originated in a lining epithe-
lium (carcinoma) or a glandular epithelium 
(adenocarcinoma) can break down the base-
ment membrane and invade the underlying 
connective tissue. 
  The histologic sequence of epithelial  tumor 
invasion starts with dysplasia (increased cell 
proliferation and incomplete cell matura-
tion), followed by carcinoma in situ  (loss of 
epithelial normal organization within the limits 
of the basement membrane), microinvasive 
carcinoma (decreased expression of cadherins 
and breakdown of the basement membrane) 
and invasive carcinoma. 
  Cessation in the expression of cadherins 
weakens the cohesive nature of the epithelial 
tumor. The production of proteinases allows 
the tumor cells to invade and attach to com-
ponents of the connective tissue. Then, tumor 
cells produce autocrine motility factors, to en-
able tumor cell motility; vascular permeability 

factors, to ensure a supply of nutrients; and 
angiogenic factors, to increase the vascular 
support of the growing tumors. Finally, tumor 
cells can produce chemokine molecules on 
their surface that facilitate their transendothe-
lial migration to metastasize.  

• Adipose tissue or fat is a special type of 
connective tissue. There are two types of 
adipose tissue: 
  (1) White fat, the major reserve of long-term 
energy.
  (2) Brown fat, a thermogenic type of fat. 
   Mesenchymal stem cells give rise to white 
fat preadipocytes and common myoblast/
brown fat preadipocyte precursors. Note that 
white fat and brown fat derive from different 
precursors. 
  The master regulator of adipogenesis  is 
PPAR(cid:97) (peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor-(cid:97)). White fat can transdifferentiate 
into brown fat-like adipocytes following cold 
exposure and (cid:96)-adrenergic signaling.
  Adipocytes synthesize lipoprotein lipase. 
Lipoprotein lipase is transferred to endothelial 
cells in the adjacent blood vessels to enable 
the passage of fatty acids and triglycerides 
into the adipocytes. 
  Fat can accumulate in a single lipid-strorage 
droplet (unilocular) or multiple small lipid 
droplets (multilocular). White fat is unilocular; 
brown fat is multilocular.

deposits can increase by inhibition of lipase 
activity (antilipolytic effect) determined by 
insulin and prostaglandins. 
  The surface of lipid droplets is surrounded by 
the protein perilipin. Phosphorylated perilipin 
changes its conformation and enables lipolysis 
by lipases.   
  Leptin, a peptide produced by adipocytes, 
regulates appetite, energy balance, and 
feeding. Leptin-deﬁcient mice are obese and 
infertile, conditions that are reversible when 
leptin is administered to the mutants.
  Adipocytes in brown fat contain abundant 
mitochondria. An important mitochondrial 
component is uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), 
a protein that allows the reentry of protons 
down their concentration gradient in the 
mitochondrial matrix, a process that results in 
the dissipation of energy in the form of heat 
(thermogenesis). 

• Cartilage is another special type of con-
nective tissue. Like adipocytes, chondroblasts 
derive from mesenchymal stem cells. Like a 
typical connective tissue member, cartilage 
consists of cells, ﬁbers, and extracellular matrix. 
Chondroblasts and chondrocytes produce 
type II collagen (except in ﬁbrocartilage, where 
chondrocytes produce type I collagen) and the 
proteoglycan aggrecan. 
  There are three major types of cartilages: 
  (1) Hyaline cartilage.
  (2) Elastic cartilage.
  (3) Fibrocartilage.
  Cartilage lacks blood vessels and is sur-
rounded by the perichondrium (except in 
ﬁbrocartilage and articular hyaline cartilage, 
which lack a perichondrium). The perichon-
drium consists of two layers: an outermost 
ﬁbrous layer, consisting of elongated ﬁbroblast-
like cells and blood vessels, and the innermost 
chondrogenic cell layer. 
  Chondrogenesis (cartilage growth) takes 
place by two mechanisms: 
  (1) Interstitial growth (within the cartilage).
  (2) Appositional growth (at the perichondrial 
surface of the cartilage). 
  During interstitial growth, centers of chondro-
genesis, consisting of chondroblasts located in 
lacunae and surrounded by a territorial matrix, 
divide by mitosis without leaving the lacunae 
and form isogenous groups. Isogenous groups 
are separated from each other by an interter-
ritorial matrix.  Interstitial growth is particularly 
prevalent during endochondral ossiﬁcation.
  During appositional growth, the cells of the 
perichondrial chondrogenic layer differentiate 
into chondroblasts following activation of the 
gene encoding the transcription factor Sox9.  
New layers are added to the surface of the 
cartilage by appositional growth.
  A lack of Sox9 gene expression causes cam-
pomelic dysplasia characterized by bowing and 
angulation of long bones, hypoplasia of the 
pelvis and scapula, and abnormalities of the 
vertebral column.

• Bone. Macroscopically, a mature long bone 
consists of a shaft or diaphysis, and two 
epiphyses at the endings of the diaphysis. A 

tapering metaphysis links each epiphysis to the 
diaphysis. During bone growth, a cartilaginous 
growth plate is present at the epiphysis-
metaphysis interface. After growth, the growth 
plate is replaced by a residual growth line. 
  The diaphysis  is surrounded by a cylinder 
of compact bone housing the bone marrow. 
The epiphyses consist of spongy or cancellous 
bone covered by a thin layer of compact bone. 
The periosteum covers the outer surface of 
the bone (except the articular surfaces and 
the tendon and ligament insertion sites). The 
endosteum lines the marrow cavity.
  Microscopically, there is:
  (1) Lamellar bone, with a regular alignment 
of collagen ﬁbers, typical of mature bone.
  (2) Woven bone, with an irregular alignment 
of collagen ﬁbers, observed in the developing 
bone.
   A cross section of a compact bone shows 
the following components: 
  (1) The periosteum, formed by an outer con-
nective tissue layer pierced by periosteal blood 
vessels penetrating Volkmann’s canals feeding 
each osteon or haversian system. The inner 
periosteal layer attaches to bone by Sharpey’s 
ﬁbers  derived from the outer periosteal layer. 
  (2) The outer circumferential lamellae. 
  (3) Osteons or haversian systems, cylindri-
cal structures parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the bone. Blood vessels are present in the 
central canal, which is surrounded by concen-
tric lamellae. Each lamella contains lacunae 
and radiating canaliculi occupied by osteocytes 
and their cell processes. Osteocyte cytoplas-
mic processes are connected to each other by 
gap junctions. A ﬂuid containing ions is present 
in the lumen of the canaliculi. 
  (4) The inner circumferential lamellae. 
  (5) Spongy bone (trabecular or cancellous 
bone), consisting of lamellae lacking a central 
canal (lamellar bone but no haversian system), 
extending into the medullary cavity. 
  (6) The endosteum, a lining of osteoprogeni-
tor cells supported by reticular ﬁbers. You can 
regard the endosteum as also the “capsule” of 
the bone marrow. 

• The two major cell components of bone are 
the osteoblast and the osteoclast. Osteoblasts 
derive from mesenchyme stem cells. Osteo-
clasts are monocyte-derived cells from the 
bone marrow.
  The osteoblast is a typical protein-producing 
cell whose function is regulated by parathy-
roid hormone and IGF-1 (produced in liver 
following stimulation by growth hormone). 
Osteoblasts synthesize type I collagen, noncol-
lagenous proteins, and proteoglycans. These 
are the components of the bone matrix or 
osteoid deposited during bone formation. 
  In mature bone, the bone matrix consists 
of about 35% organic components and 
about 65% inorganic components (calcium 
phosphate with the crystalline characteristics of 
hydroxyapatite). 
  There are several noncollagenous proteins 
produced by osteoblasts that you should 
remember: macrophage colony- stimulat-
ing factor (M-CSF), RANKL, osteoprotegerin, 

osteocalcin, osteonectin and osteopontin. The 
ﬁrst three play an essential role in osteoclas-
togenesis. Osteoclacin is a blood biochemical 
marker of osteogenesis. Osteonectin binds to 
type I collagen and hydroxyapatite. Osteo-
pontin contributes to the development of the 
sealing zone during osteoclast bone resorp-
tion activity.
   Under the inﬂuence of the transcription 
factor Sox9, mesenchymal stem cells give 
rise to preosteoblasts, the mitotically–active 
osteoprogenitor cells expressing the transcrip-
tion factor  Runx2.  Preosteoblasts differenti-
ate into postmitotic osteoblasts expressing the 
transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix (Osx). 
  Osteoblasts can follow three differentiation 
routes: 
  (1) To become osteocytes.
  (2) To remain as quiescent bone-lining cells. 
  (3) To undergo apoptosis.
  Note that the osteoblast differentiation 
process requires the participation of three 
transcription factors: Sox9, Runx2, and Osx.  
   Runx2-deﬁcient mice have a skeleton 
consisting of cartilage and lack osteoclasts. 
In humans, cleidocranial dysplasia, character-
ized by hypoplastic clavicles and delayed 
ossiﬁcation of sutures of certain skull bones, 
is associated with defective expression of the  
Runx2 gene. 

  The function of osteoclasts is regulated by 
calcitonin, produced by C cells located in the 
thyroid gland. Active osteoclasts, involved in 
bone resorption, are highly polarized cells. The 
free domain has a sealing zone, a tight belt 
consisting of (cid:95)v(cid:96)3 integrin with its intracellular 
domain linked to F-actin and the extracellular 
domain attached to osteopontin on the bone 
surface. 
  The domain associated to the subosteoclas-
tic compartment (Howship’s lacunae) displays 
a rufﬂed plasma membrane (rufﬂed border). 
The cytoplasm contains mitochondria, coated 
vesicles and acidiﬁed vesicles. The osteoclast 
is a multinucleated cell resulting from the 
fusion of several monocytes during osteoclas-
togenesis. 
  You should be aware that the bone marrow 
contains megakaryocytes that may be con-
fused with the osteoclasts.  Osteoclasts are 
intimately associated to bone and are multi-
nucleated; megakaryocytes are surrounded 
by hematopoietic cells and their nucleus is 
multilobed.
  Howship’s lacuna is the site where bone 
is removed by an osteoclast. Bone removal 
occurs in two phases: First, the mineral com-
ponent is mobilized in an acidic environment 
(~pH 4.5); second, the organic component is 
degraded by cathepsin K. 
  Carbonic anhydrase II in the cytoplasm 
of the osteoclast produces protons and 
bicarbonate from CO2 and water. The acidiﬁed 
vesicles, with H+-ATPase in their membranes, 
are inserted in the rufﬂing border. With the 
help of mitochondrial ATP, H+ are released 
through the H+-ATPase pump into Howship’s 
lacuna and the pH becomes increasingly 
acidic. 

158

4. CONNECTIVE TISSUE

Essential concepts 

  Bicarbonate escapes the cell through a 
bicarbonate-chloride exchanger; chloride 
entering the osteoclast is released into the 
lacuna. Because of the signiﬁcant H+ transport, 
a parallel bicarbonate-chloride ion transport 
mechanism is required to maintain intracellular 
electroneutrality.

• Osteoclastogenesis. The osteoclast precursor 
is a member of the monocyte-macrophage 
lineage present in the adjacent bone marrow. 
Osteoblasts recruit monocytes and differenti-
ate them into osteoclasts, the cell in charge of 
bone remodeling and mobilization of calcium.
  Osteoclastogenesis consists of several 
phases under strict control by the osteoblast. 
Osteoblasts produce: 
  (1) M-CSF, that binds to the M-CSF receptor 
on the monocyte surface and the monocyte 
becomes a macrophage. 
  (2) The macrophage expresses RANK, a 
transmembrane receptor for the ligand RANKL 
produced by the osteoblast, and becomes an 

osteoclast precursor.
  (3) RANK-RANKL interaction commits the 
osteoclast precursor to osteoclastogenesis. 
RANKL binding trimerizes RANK, which recruits 
TRAF6 to promote the nuclear translocation 
of NFATc1 and NF-(cid:103)B to activate osteoclast 
differentiation. 
  (4) Osteoprotegerin, also produced by the 
osteoblasts, binds to RANKL to prevent RANK-
mediated association of the osteoclast precur-
sor. This event can stop osteoclastogenesis (it 
does not stop osteoclast function). 
  (5) The osteoclast precursor becomes a rest-
ing osteoclast waiting to attach to bone and 
become a functional osteoclast. 
  (6) An osteoclast becomes functional when 
(cid:95)v(cid:96)3 integrin binds to osteopontin and begins 
the formation of the sealing zone. Then, the 
H+-ATPase-containing acidiﬁed vesicles are 
transported by motor proteins associated to 
microtubules to the rufﬂing border. The acidi-
ﬁcation of Howship’s lacuna starts with the 
activation of carbonic anhydrase II.

• Osteoporosis, osteopetrosis and osteomala-
cia are bone pathologic conditions.
  Osteoporosis is the loss of bone mass 
leading to bone fragility and susceptibility to 
fractures. The major factor in osteoporosis is 
the deﬁciency of the sex steroid estrogen that 
occurs in postmenopausal women. Because 
an increase in the number of osteoclasts 
exceeds the amount of formed new bone, 
the monoclonal antibody  denosumab, with 
binding afﬁnity to RANKL, functions like 
osteoprotegerin (blocking the interaction of 
RANKL with RANK receptor) to reduce further 
differentiation of the osteoclast precursor.
  Osteopetrosis is a clinical syndrome caused 
by a failure of osteoclasts to remodel bone. 
A mutation of the gene encoding M-CSF 
prevents the differentiation of osteoclasts.
  Osteomalacia is characterized by  a progres-
sive softening and bending of the bones. 
Softening occurs because of  a defect in the 
mineralization of the osteoid due to lack of 
vitamin D or renal tubular dysfunction.

5. Osteogenesis

Bone, including associated ligaments, tendons and articular cartilage, withstand the forces of compression, ten-
sion and shear stress. Bone develops by replacement of a preexisting connective tissue. The two processes of 
bone formation–osteogenesis or ossiﬁcation–observed in the embryo are: (1) intramembranous ossiﬁcation, in 
which bone tissue is laid down directly in embryonic connective tissue or mesenchyme, and (2) endochondral 
ossiﬁcation, in which bone tissue replaces a preexisting hyaline cartilage, the template–or anlage–of the future 
bone. In addition to a description of the two major processes of ossiﬁcation, this chapter addresses pathologic 
conditions, such as the sequence of bone fracture healing, metabolic and hereditary disorders and rheumatoid 
arthritis, within an integrated histologic and clinical context.

Intramembranous ossiﬁcation 
The  mechanism  of  bone  formation  during  intra-
membranous  and  endochondral  ossiﬁcation  is  es-
sentially the same: A primary trabecular network, 
called  primary  spongiosa,  is  ﬁrst  laid  down  and 

then transformed into mature bone. But there is a 
difference in the nature of the template that becomes 
bone: a mesenchymal template is the starting point 
of    intramembranous  ossiﬁcation,  in  contrast  to  a 
cartilage template of endochondral ossiﬁcation.  

Figure 5-1. Intramembranous ossiﬁcation

       Mesenchymal cells aggregate without a 
cartilage intermediate.  This process is controlled 
by patterning signals from polypeptides of the 
Wnt, hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, and 
transforming growth factor–(cid:96) families.

2
       Mesenchymal cells differentiate into 
osteoblasts. A bone blastema is formed.    
Osteocytes within the core of the blastema are 
interconnected by cell processes forming a 
functional syncytium. Osteoblasts line the 
surface of the bone blastema.   

3
       Bone matrix (osteoid) is deposited by 
osteoblasts. Later, Ca2+, transported by blood 
vessels, is used in the mineralization process 
and primary bone tissue is formed.      
Osteoclasts initiate the modeling of the bone 
tissue.

Multiple individual trabeculae enlarge by appositional growth 
and eventually fuse together as a primary ossification center  
organized during the first stage of intramembranous ossification.
   Although primary bone tissue formation begins as an 
interstitial process, it soon becomes appositional.
   Osteocytes become trapped within the calcified osteoid. 
   At the surface of the osteoid, osteoblasts continue the 
appositional deposit of matrix, mainly type I collagen and 
noncollagenous proteins.

Intramembranous ossiﬁcation of certain parts of 
the  skull  and  the  clavicle  occurs  in  the  following 
sequence (Figure 5-1):

1. The embryonic connective tissue (mesenchyme)
becomes  highly  vascularized  and  mesenchymal 
stem  cells  aggregate  while  still  embedded  in  an 
extracellular matrix containing collagen ﬁbers and 
proteoglycans.

 Box 5-A  |  From preosteoblasts to osteoblasts to osteocytes

•  Mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into preosteoblasts and then into os-
teoblasts for bone formation when they express the transcription factor Runx2 
and later, at a more advanced stage of differentiation, Runx2 and osterix.
•  The differentiation of osteoblasts to osteocytes requires the expression of 
Runx2 and osterix.
•  The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into chondrocytes occurs 
when the gene encoding Sox9 is expressed.  During endochondral ossiﬁcation 
(as we will see later), chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy. The transition from 
cell cycling chondrocyte to hypertrophic chondrocyte is stimulated by Runx2 
but inhibited by Sox9.
•  Putting things together, Runx2 has a role in chondrocytic and osteoblastic 
differentiation. Runx2 and Osterix specify the differentiation of osteoblasts to 
osteocytes. A lack of osterix gene expression affects osteoblastic differentiation 
but not chondrocyte maturation. An example is cleidocranial dysplasia with 
defects in intramembranous and endochondral ossiﬁcation.

5. OSTEOGENESIS

Intramembranous ossiﬁcation

The continued deposition of bone on trabecular 
surfaces determines the occlusion of the 
intertrabecular spaces, and compact bone is 
formed.
    In other areas, the thickening of the trabeculae 
does not occur and the connective tissue in the 
intertrabecular space differentiates into 
hematopoietic tissue. The primary spongiosa 
persists as cancellous bone.

           Intramembranous ossification

The frontal and parietal bones and parts of the 
occipital, temporal, mandible, and maxilla bones 
develop by intramembranous ossification.
Intramembranous ossification requires:
        A well-vascularized primitive connective 
1
tissue.
        Bone formation is not preceded by the 
2
formation of a cartilage.
        An aggregate of mesenchymal stem cells 
3
differentiates directly into osteoid-producing 
osteoblasts.

Osteoblasts organize thin trabeculae of woven 
bone, forming an irregular network called primary 
spongiosa.

Acidophilic osteoid

2.  Aggregated  mesenchymal  stem  cells  directly 
differentiate  into  osteoblasts  that  begin  to  secrete 
osteoid  or  bone  matrix  (see  Box  5-A).  Numerous 
ossification  centers  develop  and  eventually  fuse, 
forming  a  network  of  anastomosing  trabeculae 
resembling a sponge, the so-called spongy bone or 
primary spongiosa.

3.  Because  collagen  ﬁbers  in  the  newly  formed 
trabeculae  are  randomly  oriented,  the  early  intra-
membranous  bone  is  described  as  woven  bone,  in 
contrast with the regularly oriented collagen ﬁbers 
of the lamellar or compact bone formed later during 
bone remodeling.

4.  Calcium  phosphate  is  deposited  in  the  bone 
matrix or osteoid, which is laid down by apposition. 
No interstitial bone growth occurs.

5. Bone matrix mineralization leads to two new 
developments (Figure 5-2): the entrapment of  os-
teoblasts as osteocytes within the mineralized bone 
matrix that is remodeled by the bone resorptive os-
teoclasts, and the partial closing of  the perivascular 
channels, which assume the new role of hematopoi-
esis by conversion of mesenchymal stem cells into 
blood-forming cells.

  Osteocytes  remain  connected  to  each  other  by

Proliferation of chondrocytes followed by their 
hypertrophy at the midpoint of the shaft initiates the 
formation of the primary ossification center.  
Hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete vascular 
endothelial cell growth factor to induce sprouting 
of blood vessels from the perichondrium. 
   Then, calcification of the matrix and apoptosis 
of hypertrophic chondrocytes occur.

Blood vessels, forming 
the periosteal bud, 
branch in opposite 

directions 

cytoplasmic processes enclosed within narrow tun-
nels  called canaliculi. New osteoblasts are generated 
from preosteoblasts, the osteoprogenitor cells, located 
adjacent to the blood vessels.

The ﬁnal developmental events include:
1.  The  conversion  of  woven  bone  to  lamellar 
(compact) bone. In lamellar bone, the newly synthe-
sized collagen ﬁbers are aligned into bundles with a 
regular orientation. Lamellae arrange in concentric 
rings  around  a  central  blood  vessel  occupying  the 
haversian canal form osteons or haversian systems. 
Membranous bones remain as spongy bone in the 
center, the diploë, enclosed by an outer and an inner 
layer of lamellar compact bone.

2. The condensation of the external and internal 
connective tissue layers to form the periosteum and 
endosteum,  respectively,  containing  osteoprogeni-
tor cells. 

At birth, bone development is not complete, and 
the bones of the skull are separated by spaces (fon-
tanelles) housing osteogenic tissue. The bones of a 
young child contain woven and lamellar bony matrix. 

Endochondral ossiﬁcation
Endochondral  ossiﬁcation  is  the  process  by  which 
skeletal  cartilage  templates  are  replaced  by  bone. 
Bones of the extremities, vertebral column, and pelvis 
(the  appendicular  skeleton)  derive  from  a  hyaline 
cartilage template.

As  in  intramembranous  ossiﬁcation,  a  primary 
ossiﬁcation center is formed  during endochondral 

ossiﬁcation  (Figure  5-3).  Unlike  intramembranous 
ossiﬁcation,  this  center  of  ossiﬁcation  starts  when 
proliferated  chondrocytes  deposit  an  extracellular 
matrix containing type II collagen.

Shortly  thereafter,  chondrocytes  in  the  central 
region  of  the  cartilage  undergo  hypertrophy  and 
synthesize type X collagen, a marker for hypertro-
phic  chondrocytes.  Angiogenic  factors  secreted  by 
hypertrophic chondrocytes (vascular endothelial cell 
growth factor [VEGF]) induce the invasion of blood 
vessels  from  the  perichondrium  to  form  a  nascent 
bone marrow cavity. 

These events result in the formation of the primary 
ossiﬁcation center. Hypertrophic chondrocytes un-
dergo apoptosis as calciﬁcation of the matrix in the 
middle  of  the  shaft  of  the  cartilage  template  takes 
place.  

At  the  same  time,  the  inner  perichondrial  cells 
exhibit their initial osteogenic potential, and a thin 
periosteal collar of bone is formed around the mid-
point of the shaft, the diaphysis. Consequently, the 
primary ossiﬁcation center ends up located inside a 
cylinder of bone. The periosteal collar, formed un-
der the periosteum by apposition, consists of woven 
bone.  The  periosteal  collar  is  later  converted  into 
compact bone. 

The following sequence of events deﬁnes the next 

steps of endochondral ossiﬁcation (Figure 5-4):

1. Blood vessels invade the space formerly occupied 
by the hypertrophic chondrocytes, and they branch 
and project toward either end of the center of ossiﬁca-
tion. Blind capillary ends extend into spaces formed 
within the calciﬁed cartilage.

2. Osteoprogenitor cells (preosteoblasts) and he-
matopoietic stem cells reach the core of the calciﬁed 
cartilage through the perivascular connective tissue 
surrounding the invading blood vessels. Then, pre-
osteoblasts differentiate into osteoblasts that aggregate 
on the surfaces of the calciﬁed cartilage and begin to 
deposit bone matrix (osteoid).

3. At this developmental step, a primary center of 
ossiﬁcation, deﬁned by the periosteal collar  and the 
center of ossiﬁcation in the interior of the cartilage 
template, is organized at the diaphysis. 

Secondary centers of ossiﬁcation develop later in 

the epiphyses.

The growth in length of the long bones depends 
on the growth of the hyaline cartilage while the cen-
ter of the cartilage is being replaced by bone at the 
equidistant zones of ossiﬁcation.

Secondary centers of ossiﬁcation 
Up to this point, we have analyzed the development 
of primary centers of ossiﬁcation in the diaphysis of 
long bones that occurs by the third month of fetal life.
After birth, secondary centers of ossiﬁcation devel-
op in the epiphyses (see Figure 5-4). As in the diaphy-

Figure 5-4. Endochondral ossiﬁcation: Secondary ossiﬁcation centers

The metaphysis is the portion of the diaphysis nearest to the epiphyses. The epiphyseal 
cartilaginous growth plate between the metaphysis and the epiphysis will eventually be 
replaced by bone. The bone at this site is particularly dense and is recognized as an 
epiphyseal line. Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the hedgehog protein family, 
stimulates chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate and prevents chondrocyte hypertrophy.

        Blood vessels from the diaphysis and

epiphysis intercommunicate.

        A similar secondary

appears in the opposite 
epiphysis.

        The epiphyseal plate has been replaced 
3
by an epiphyseal line. This process occurs 
gradually from puberty to maturity, and the 
long bone can no longer grow in length.

sis, the space occupied by hypertrophic chondrocytes 
is invaded by blood vessels and preosteoblasts from 
the  perichondrium.  Most  of  the  hyaline  cartilage 
of  the  epiphyses  is  replaced  by  the  spongy  bone, 
except  for  the  articular  cartilage  and  a  thin  disk, 
the  epiphyseal  growth  plate,  located  between  the 
epiphyses and the diaphysis. The epiphyseal growth 
plate is responsible for subsequent growth in length 
of the bone by a mechanism that we discuss later.

Zones of endochondral ossiﬁcation
We have seen that the deposition of bone in the center 
of the diaphysis is preceded by an erosion process in 
the hyaline cartilage template (see Figures 5-3 and 
5-4). This center of erosion, deﬁned as the primary 
ossiﬁcation  center,  extends  in  opposite  directions 
of  the  template,  coinciding  with  the  formation  of 
a bony collar. 

The bony collar provides strength to the midsec-
tion of the diaphysis or shaft as the cartilage is weak-
ened by the gradual removal of the cartilage before 
its replacement by bone. 

The continuing process of cartilage erosion and 
bone  deposition  can  be  visualized  histologically 
(Figure 5-5). Four major zones can be distinguished, 
starting at the end of the cartilage and approaching 
the zone of erosion:

1. The reserve zone is a site composed of primitive 
hyaline cartilage and is responsible for the growth in 
length of the bone as the erosion and bone deposition 
process advances.  

2. The proliferative zone is characterized by the 
active  mitotic  activity  of  chondrocytes  aligning  as 
cellular stacks parallel to the long axis of the cartilage 
template (Figures 5-6 and 5-7). 

3. The hypertrophic zone is deﬁned by chondro-
cyte  apoptosis  and  calciﬁcation  of  the  territorial 
matrix surrounding the columns of previously pro-
liferated chondrocytes.

Despite  their  structurally  collapsing  appearance 
(see Figure 5-7), postmitotic hypertrophic chondro-
cytes play an important role in bone growth. Hyper-
trophic chondrocytes have the following functional 
characteristics:

The proliferative zone contains flattened chondrocytes in columns or clusters parallel to the 
growth axis. Chondrocytes are separated by the territorial matrix. All the chondrocytes within a 
cluster share a common territorial matrix.

The deepest zone, proximal to the vascular inva-
sion zone, consisting of thinner and disrupted trans-
verse calciﬁed septa, faces the blind end of capillary 
sprouts (Figure 5-8) of the developing bone marrow 
cavity containing hematopoietic cells.  

4. The vascular invasion zone, an angiogenic pro-
cess stimulated by VEGF produced by hypertrophic 
chondrocytes, is the site where blood vessels penetrate 
the fragmented transverse septa and carry with them 
migrating preosteoblasts and osteoclast-like resorp-
tive chondroclasts.  

Preosteoblasts  give  rise  to  osteoblasts  that  begin 
lining the surfaces of the exposed cores of calciﬁed 
cartilage (stained blue, basophilic, in the light micros-
copy photograph in Figures 5-6 and 5-8) and initiate 
the deposition of osteoid (stained pink, acidophilic, 
in Figure 5-8). The cartilage longitudinal struts are 
gradually replaced by bone spicules

The deposit of osteoid denotes the beginning of 
osteogenesis  and  results  in  the  formation  of  bone 
spicules (with a calciﬁed cartilage matrix core) and, 
later, their conversion into trabeculae (consisting of

lacking calciﬁed cartilage matrix). As a consequence, 
woven bone appears in the midsection of the devel-
oping bone. 

Growth in length of the diaphysis 
The ossiﬁcation process advances bidirectionally to-
ward the equidistant hypertrophic zones as the bone 
marrow cavity increases in width by the combined 
loss of cartilage and remodeling of the newly formed 
bone spicules by osteoclasts.  

Imagine endochondral osteogenesis as an invad-
ing  process  consisting  of  an  ossiﬁcation  front  that 
advances  by  replacing  hypertrophic  chondrocytes 
while osteoclasts are engaged in the remodeling of 
nascent bone spicules and enlarging the bone marrow 
cavity (Figure 5-9). 

In response to the invasion front, chondrocytes of 
the proliferating zone, supplied by chondrocytes of 
the reserve zone adjacent to the epiphyseal growth 
plate, continue to divide and delay their conversion 
into hypertrophic chondrocytes, thus keeping a dis-
tance from the osteogenic-osteoclast invasion front. 
Consequently,  the  shaft  or  diaphysis  grows  in 
length by keeping intact and active the cartilage of 
the  epiphyseal  growth  plate,  located  between  the 
diaphysis and epiphysis of the bone. 

How does the growth plate manage to keep run-
ning  away  from  the  chasing  invading  ossiﬁcation-
osteoclast front?

Hedgehog signaling: The epiphyseal growth plate 
and dwarﬁsm
Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the hedgehog 
family of proteins, is expressed by early hypertrophic 
chondrocytes within the endochondral template.

Ihh has the following signaling functions (Figure 

5-10):  

1. To  stimulate  adjacent  perichondrial  chondro-
cytes  to  express  RUNX2    and  differentiate  into 
osteoblasts to continue forming the bone collar.

2. Also, to stimulate perichondrial chondrocytes to 
produce  and  secrete  parathyroid  hormone–related 
peptide (PTHrP).

PTHrP has two functions:
1. PTHrP binds to its receptor (PTHrPr) on the 
surface of chondrocytes of the reserve zone to stimu-
late their proliferation. 

2. PTHrP also binds to chondrocytes of the pro-
liferative  zone  to  inhibit  their  differentiation  into 
hypertrophic chondrocytes.  

Essentially, Ihh maintains the pool of proliferating 
chondrocytes in the epiphyseal growth plate by delay-
ing their hypertrophy.  A feedback loop between Ihh 
and PTHrP regulates the balance between proliferat-
ing and hypertrophic chondrocytes. 

At the end of the growing period, the epiphyseal 
growth plate is gradually eliminated and a continuum 
is established between the diaphysis and the epiphyses. 
No further growth in length of the bone is possible 
once the epiphyseal growth plate disappears.

Note that PTHrP has opposite effects to ensure the maintenance of the 
growth plate and longitudinal growth of long bones. Growth plate inactivation 
occurs at puberty when the height of the individual is determined. Growth 
plate inactivation is the direct result of an increase of estrogen secretion at 
puberty in both women and men.

Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common skeletal dysplasia causing 
short-limb dwarfism. Skeletal defects are determined by a decrease in the 
proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes.  Fibroblast growth factor 
receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, normally controls a signal 
that stops chondrogenesis.  Mutations in the gene encoding FGFR3 are 
identified in patients with ACH. Mutations cause FGFR3 to become 
overactive, stopping the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. 

Growth of the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage

       Indian hedgehog (Ihh) protein, secreted by 
1
chondrocytes of the early hypertrophic zone, signals 
the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid 
hormone–related protein (PTHrP) by cells of the 
chondrogenic layer of the perichondrium (epiphysis). 
   Ihh has two functions: (1) regulation of the formation of 
the bone collar by stimulating the expression of RUNX2, 
thus promoting the differentiation of perichondrial cells 
into osteoblasts; (2) stimulation of PTHrP secretion by 
perichondrial cells.
       PTHrP binds to its receptor (PTHrPr) on the surface 
2
of chondrocytes of the reserve zone to stimulate their 
proliferation.
       PTHrP also binds to chondrocytes of the proliferative 
3
zone to inhibit their differentiation into hypertrophic 
chondrocytes.
       Chondrocytes of the late hypertrophic zone secrete  
4
type X collagen, a marker of differentiation, and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an inducer 
of vascular invasion. 

Clinical significance: Metaphyseal chondrodysplasia

Mutations of the genes encoding PTHrP and PTHrPr give 
rise to Jansen's disease or metaphyseal 
chondrodysplasia.
   Circulating parathyroid hormone cannot compensate 
for PTHrP deficiencies because the avascular nature of 
the cartilage makes parathyroid hormone circulating in 
blood relatively inaccessible to chondrocytes.

A lack of expression of Ihh protein in mutant mice 
results in dwarﬁsm and absence of endochondral os-
siﬁcation. In contrast, intramembranous ossiﬁcation 
does not appear to require Ihh signaling. Ossiﬁcation 
of the skull bones is normal in Ihh-null mice. 

Conversion of a bone trabecula into an osteon
As the bone grows in length, new layers of bone are 
laid down under the periosteum of the diaphysis by 
appositional growth. Simultaneous gradual erosion 
of the inner wall of the diaphysis results in a width 
increase of the marrow cavity. As a result, the overall 
width of the shaft or diaphysis increases but the walls 
does not increase proportionally in thickness.

How does the trabecular organization of the devel-
oping bone by endochondral ossiﬁcation change into  
the form of haversian systems or osteons?

 The stalactite-like spicules formed during endo-
chondral  ossiﬁcation  change  into  trabeculae.  Re-
member that a spicule consists of a longitudinal core 
of calciﬁed cartilage coated by osteoid produced by 
osteoblasts lining the surface. In contrast, a trabecula 
lacks the calciﬁed cartilage core; instead it contains an 

osteocyte lamellar core lined by osteoblast depositing 
osteoid on the surface.

Trabeculae are then converted into osteons, each 
consisting of a bone cylinder with a central longitu-
dinal tunnel housing a blood vessel. Blood vessels at 
the exterior of the shaft derive from periosteal blood 
vessels and branches of the nutrient artery are pro-
vided at the endosteal site.

The  following  sequence  is  observed  during  the 

trabecula–to–osteon conversion (Figure 5-11):

1. The longitudinal edges of a trabecula are the 
boundary of a groove. The groove contains a blood 
vessel (derived from the initial vascular invasion zone). 
The ridges and grooves are lined by osteoblasts that 
continue depositing osteoid. The wall of the trabecula 
contains  entrapped  osteocytes  within  mineralized 
osteoid.

As a result of the ridges growing toward one an-
other, the groove is converted into a tunnel lined by 
osteoblasts  and  the  blood  vessel  becomes  trapped 
inside a tunnel. The blood vessel interconnects with a 
similar vessel of an adjacent tunnel through perforat-
ing spaces leading to a Volkmann’s canal.

       When the bone reaches full size, outer and inner 
circumferential lamellae provide the boundaries of the 
compact bone consisting of multiple osteons. Interstitial 
lamellae are found between the osteons. 
  The interstitial lamellae represent remnants of preexisting 
osteons replaced by new osteons during remodeling. 
Remodeling occurs throughout life and is part of normal 
bone maintenance. 
  As one osteon is formed by the activity of osteoblasts, 
another osteon is dismantled by osteoclasts and then 
replaced or rebuilt.

2. Osteoblasts lining the wall of the tunnel deposit 
by apposition new concentric lamellae and convert 
the  structure  into  an  osteon.  Unlike  the  osteons, 
Volkmann’s canals are not surrounded by concentric 
lamellae.

3. Appositional growth continues adding lamel-
lae under the periosteum, which with time become 
the outer circumferential lamellae surrounding the 
entire shaft. 

A  modeling–remodeling  process  occurs  through 
the balancing activities of the bone-forming osteo-
blasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. At the end 
of  the  process,  the  outer  circumferential  lamellae 
becomes  the  boundary  of  the  multiple  haversian 
systems and interstitial lamellae ﬁll the spaces between 
the haversian systems or osteons.

4. Osteoblasts lining the inner surface of the bone, 
the endosteum, develop the inner circumferential 
lamellae by a similar mechanism described for the 

outer circumferential lamellae. 

The crevices between the cylindrical osteons and 
osteons and outer and inner circumferential lamel-
lae  contain  interstitial  lamellae  corresponding  to 
remnants  of  the  older  lamellae  derived  from  bone 
remodeling.    

Bone remodeling
Bone  remodeling  is  the  continuous  replacement 
of old bone by newly formed bone throughout life 
and  occurs  at  random  locations. The  purpose  of 
remodeling is: 

1. To establish the optimum of bone strength by 
repairing microscopic damage (called microcrack-
ing).

2. To maintain calcium homeostasis.  
Microcracking, caused by minor trauma, can be 
limited to just a region of an osteon. For example, 
damage  to  canaliculi  interconnecting  osteocytes

Osteoclast precursors are recruited 
to the haversian canal and 
differentiate into osteoclasts. 
   Osteoclasts are lining the bone 
lamella facing the canal and start 
the bone resorption process of the 
inner lamella and consecutive 
lamellae toward the outer lamella. 
Interstitial lamellae are residuals of 
the remodeling osteon.

Additional osteoclast 
precursors are recruited as 
lamellar resorption progresses 
slightly beyond the boundary 
of the original osteon.
   When osteoclasts stop 
removing bone, osteoblasts 
appear (osteoclast to 
osteoblast reversal). 

Osteoblasts reverse the 
resorption process by organizing 
a layer inside the reabsorption 
cavity and starting to secrete 
osteoid. The cement line 
indicates the boundary of the 
newly organized lamella.
   New bone lamellae continue to 
be deposited toward the center 
of the osteon. 

Osteoblasts continue laying 
down bone and eventually 
become trapped within the 
mineralized bone matrix and 
become osteocytes.  
   A new osteon or haversian 
system is formed leaving 
behind interstitial lamellae.

Trabecular bone remodeling occurs on the bone surface, in contrast to 
cortical bone remodeling, which occurs within an osteon. The trabecular 
endosteal surface is remodeled by this mechanism similar to cortical bone 

remodeling: osteoclasts create a resorption space limited by a cement 
line. Then osteoblast line the cement line surface and start to deposit 
osteoid until new bone closes the resorption space. 

disrupts osteocyte cell-cell communication, leading 
to cell death. Microcracking  can be repaired by the 
osteoclast-osteoblast remodeling process illustrated at 
the top of Figure 5-12. If the architecture of the osteon 
is defective, as in osteoporosis, microcracking becomes 
widespread and a complete bone fracture may occur.   
Under  normal  conditions,  the  same  amount  of 
resorbed bone is replaced by the same volume of new 
bone. If the volume of resorbed bone is not completely 
replaced by new bone, the tissue becomes weakened 
and a risk of spontaneous fractures arises.  

There are two forms of bone remodeling: 
1. Compact bone remodeling.
2. Trabecular bone remodeling. 
Compact bone remodeling is the resorption of an 
old haversian system followed by the organization of 
a new haversian system (see Figure 5-12). 

Trabecular bone remodeling occurs on the endos-
teal bone surface (see Figure 5-12), in contrast to cor-
tical bone remodeling, that occurs inside an osteon. 

Note  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between  compact 
bone remodeling and trabecular bone remodeling: 
the  remodeled  trabecular  bone  remains  lamellar 
but not haversian. In other words, lamellae are not 
enclosing a blood vessel as in the haversian systems 
that characterize compact bone remodeling.

General Pathology: Bone fracture and healing
Traumatic bone fracture are common during child-
hood  and  in  the  elderly.  Pathologic  fractures  are 
independent of trauma and associated with a bone 
alteration,  such  as  osteoporosis  or  a  genetic  col-
lagen defect such as osteogenesis imperfecta. Stress 
fractures  are  caused  by  inapparent  minor  trauma 
(microcracking) during the practice of sports. 

Fractures can be:
1. Complete fractures, when the bone fragments 

are separated from each other. 

2. Comminuted fractures, when a complete frac-

ture produces more than two bone fragments.

Accumulation of blood between the fracture ends, under the periosteum and the

Osteocytes and marrow cells undergo cell death and necrotic material is observed in 
the immediate fracture zone. An inflammatory response follows. Macrophages and 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes migrate into a fibrin scaffold and an inflammatory 
granuloma is formed. The fracture is stabilized.

Reparative phase: Soft callus formation 

Cells derived from the periosteum and endosteum initiate the repair of the fracture.  
Periosteal-derived capillary buds extend into the inflammatory granuloma. The 
nutrient medullary artery also contributes capillaries. Cartilage is formed and a soft 
callus contributes to the stability of the bone fractured ends. Woven bone, in the form 
of trabeculae, gradually replaces the cartilage. Mineralization of the woven bone is 
observed.

ends of the fractured bone, and even portions of the hard callus, are being 
reabsorbed. In addition, woven bone needs to be replaced by compact bone.

1. Hematoma/inﬂammatory phase. Bleeding and 
accumulation of blood at the fracture site occurs (he-
matoma) because of massive disruption of blood ves-
sels housed in the haversian and Volkmann's canals. 
Swelling, pain and an inﬂammatory process starts 
immediately. Macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, 
and polymorphonuclear cells, as well as ﬁbroblasts, 
are  attracted  to  the  fracture  site. The  result  is  the 
formation  of  granulation  tissue  that  bulges  over 
the  edges  of  the  fractured  bone  and  connects  the 
fragments. 

The development of this temporary granuloma is 
seen during the ﬁrst week after fracture. Cytokines 
released by inﬂammatory cells and platelets recruit 
osteprogenitor cells from the periosteum and endos-
teum to the temporary granuloma, whose appropriate 
formation and stability require proper immobiliza-
tion in the form of bracing.  

2.  Reparative  phase:  cartilagenous  soft  callus 
(Latin  callus,  hard  skin)  phase.  Phagocytic  cells 
start the removal of dead cells and damaged bone 
tissue.  Capillaries  inﬁltrate  the  granulation  tissue 
and osteoprogenitor cells give rise to osteoblasts at 
the periosteal and endosteal sites that, together with 
ﬁbroblasts, initiate the healing process. A soft callus 
consisting of noncalciﬁed cartilage connects the two 
ends of the fractured bone. 

About 3 to 4 weeks after the injury, periosteal and 
endosteal-derived osteoblasts penetrate and replace 
the soft cartilaginous callus with woven bone. 

Osteoblast penetration starts from each end of the 
fractured fragments and a distinct collar, consisting 
of woven bone typical of cancellous bone, is formed 
around the fragments. 

3. Reparative phase: hard bone callus phase. The 
union of the fragments is achieved by the develop-
ment  of  a  hard  bone  callus.  Osteoblasts  deposit 
osteoid that is calciﬁed and woven bone is formed.

4. Remodeling phase. This repair process is still 
in  progress  2  to  3  months  after  the  injury.  Excess 

material of the bone callus is removed by osteoclasts 
and woven bone is replaced by lamellar compact bone 
between and around the bone fragments.  

General Pathology: Metabolic and hereditary bone 
disorders
As we have learned, ossiﬁcation results from the bal-
anced  processes  of  bone  formation  and  resorption 
mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, 
under  the  control  of  local  regulatory  factors  and 
blood-borne signaling molecules, including parathy-
roid hormone, vitamin D3, and calcium. 

Excessive resorption causes osteoporosis, account-
ing for most non-traumatic bone fractures. Defective 
bone resorption causes osteopetrosis, characterized by 
dense but usually fragile bones. 

A number of metabolic/dietary and hereditary con-
ditions can alter the skeleton by affecting osteogenesis, 
bone remodeling or disturbing the mineralization of 
the bone matrix (Figure 5-14).

Rickets and osteomalacia are a group of bone dis-
eases characterized by a defect in the mineralization 
of the bone matrix (osteoid), most often caused by 
a lack of vitamin D3. Rickets is observed in children 
and  produces  skeletal  deformities.  Osteomalacia  is 
observed in adults and is caused by poor mineraliza-
tion of the bone matrix. 

We have already stressed the medical signiﬁcance 
of the RANK-RANKL signaling pathway as a phar-
macologic target in the treatment of osteoporosis by 
controlling osteoclastogenesis.   

Osteopetrosis includes a group of hereditary dis-
eases characterized by abnormal osteoclast function. 
The bone is abnormally brittle and breaks like a soft 
stone. The marrow canal is not developed, and most 
of the bone is woven because of absent remodeling.
We have already discussed a mutation in the colony-
stimulating factor-1 gene whose expression is required 
for the formation of osteoclasts (see Bone in Chapter 
4, Connective Tissue).

A clinical variant of autosomal dominant osteope-

ease, is caused by different mutations in the CICN7 
gene encoding the chloride channel in osteoclasts. 
Recall that Cl– is required to acidify the Howship’s 
resorption lacunae environment for the activation of 
secretory cathepsin K enzyme. Review in Chapter 4,

the discussion on osteopetrosis.

 Fibrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva (FOP) is a 
very rare autosomal dominant disorder of the con-
nective tissue. The main clinical features are skeletal 
malformations (hands and feet) present at birth and

the ossiﬁcation of soft tissues (muscles of the neck 
and back) precipitated by trauma. Ectopic bone for-
mation also occurs in ligaments, fasciae, aponeuroses, 
tendons, and joint capsules. 

Patients with FOP have a mutation in the gene en-
coding activin receptor type 1A (ACVR1), a receptor 
for bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). An early 
clinical indication of FOP is a short big toe malforma-
tion detected in the newborn. BMPs are members of 
the transforming growth factor–(cid:96)(cid:3)superfamily with 
a role in the development of bone and other tissues. 
The  ACVR1  mutation  consists  in  the  substitu-
tion of histidine for arginine at position 206 of the 
509-amino-acids-long ACVR1.  This single amino 
acid substitution results in the abnormal constitutive 
activation of ACVR1 leading to the transformation 
of connective tissue and muscle tissue into a second-
ary skeleton. A poor prognosis is determined by the 
involvement of thoracic muscles, leading to  respira-
tory failure.

Osteogenesis  imperfecta  is  a  genetic  disorder 
characterized by fragile bones and fractures ("brittle 
bone  disease").  Additional  defects  include  hearing 
loss, scoliosis, curved long bones, blue sclera, dentino-
genesis imperfecta, and short stature. This condition  
is caused by a dominant mutation to genes encoding 
type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2).  In patients 
with osteogenesis imperfecta, bisphosphonate drugs 
reduce bone fracture by inhibiting bone resorption 
and increasing bone mass and whole body mechani-
cal vibrations treatment stimulates bone formation.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease 
characterized by the presence of activated  CD4+ T cells       , 
plasma cells, macrophages      , and synovial cells       changing 
the synovial membrane lining into villus-type inflammatory tissue 
called pannus.  Within the pannus, cellular responses lead to 
release of collagenase and metalloproteases       and other 
effector molecules. 
   The initial cause of rheumatoid arthritis is a peptide antigen 
presented to T cells (CD4+) which, in turn, release interleukin-15 
to activate synovial macrophages normally present in the synovial 
membrane. 
   Synovial macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines, 
tumor necrosis factor ligand(cid:3)and interleukins-1 and -6, to 
induce the proliferation of synovial cells, which then release 
collagenase and matrix metalloproteases. Neutrophils 
contribute prostaglandins, proteases, and reactive oxygen 
species targeted to the destruction of the articular cartilage and 
subjacent bone tissue.  The chronic destruction of the articular 
cartilage, erosion of the periarticular periosteal bone by activated 
osteoclasts and the hypertrophy of the synovial membrane are 
characteristic features of rheumatoid arthritis.

Joints
Bones are interconnected by articulations, or joints, 
that permit movement. 
   There are three types of joints:

1.  Synarthroses  permit  little  or  no  movement 

(cranial bones, ribs, and the sternum).

2. Amphiarthroses enable slight movement (inter-

vertebral disks and bodies). 

3. Diarthroses permit free movement.
In  a  diarthroidal  joint  (Figure  5-15),  a  capsule 
links the ends of the bones. The capsule is lined by 

a synovial membrane that encloses the articular or 
synovial cavity. The synovial cavity has lubricin, a 
synovial  ﬂuid  glycoprotein  necessary  for  reducing 
wear to the hyaline cartilage covering the opposing 
articular surfaces.

The  articular  cartilage  is  almost  typical  hyaline 
cartilage  except  that  it  lacks  a  perichondrium  and 
has a unique collagen ﬁber organization in the form 
of overlapping arches. Collagen arcades sustain the 
mechanical stress on the joint surfaces.

The joint capsule consists of two layers: 

176

5. OSTEOGENESIS

Rheumatoid arthritis

1. An outer layer of dense connective tissue with 

blood vessels and nerves.

2. An inner layer, called the synovial membrane, 
covered by one to two layers of synovial cells overly-
ing the connective tissue (Figure 5-16). 
There are two classes of synovial cells: 
1. Type A macrophage-like synovial cells.
2. Type B ﬁbroblast-like synovial cells. 
There is no basal lamina separating synovial cells 
from  the  connective  tissue. The  connective  tissue 
contains a rich network of fenestrated capillaries. 
Synovial ﬂuid is a combined product of the syno-
vial cells and the ultraﬁltrate of the capillaries. The 
ﬂuid is rich in hyaluronic acid,  glycoproteins, and 
leukocytes. 

Pathology: Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid  arthritis  is  a  chronic  inﬂammatory 
and destructive autoimmune disease of the joints of 
unknown cause. Synovitis, the inﬂammatory process 
of the synovial membrane, occurs when leukocytes 
inﬁltrate the synovial compartment. 

The production of cytokines by synovial cells is a 
key factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthri-
tis. The initial event is the recruitment of activated 
CD4+ T cells across synovial vessels. Activated CD4+ 
T cells stimulate the production of tumor necrosis 
factor  ligand  (TNFL),  interleukin-2  (IL-2),  and 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the secretion of collagenase 
and metalloproteinases (in particular MMP-1, 3, 8, 
13, 14, and 16), by monocytes, macrophages, and 
ﬁbroblast-like synovial cells. 

TNFL and IL-1 can be detected in synovial ﬂuid of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  TNFL and IL-1 
stimulate  ﬁbroblast-like  synovial  cells,  osteoclasts, 
and  chondrocytes  to  release  cartilage  and  bone-
destroying MMPs.

Tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are unable 

to reverse the joint destructive cascade. Neutrophils 
synthesize  prostaglandins,  proteases  and  reactive 
oxygen  species,  contributors  to  synovitis. TNFL, 
IL-1, and IL-6 are key cytokines driving the build 
up  of  synovial  inﬂammatory  tissue  in  rheumatoid 
arthritis (Figure 5-17). 

A proliferative process (hyperplasia) of the synovial 
cell lining, together with a loss in the expression of 
wear protective lubricin, leads to the destruction of 
the articular cartilage by apoptosis of chondrocytes, 
followed by destruction of the subjacent bone. Bone 
erosion, a result from osteoclast invading the perios-
teum adjacent to the articular surface, is detected in 
80% of the affected patients within 1 year after diag-
nosis. Osteoclasts are activated by synovial cytokines.
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the pro-
duction of the autoantibodies rheumatoid factor and 
anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA):

1. Rheumatoid factor is a highly afﬁnity autoan-
tibody against the Fc domain of immunoglobulins. 
Rheumatoid factor has a dual role: it is a diagnostic 
marker of rheumatoid arthritis and also participates 
in its pathogenesis.

2.  A  post-translational  conversion  of  the  amino 
acid arginine into citrulline modiﬁes the folding of 
citrullinated proteins that become a selective target of 
the immune system.  ACPA-positive patients disease 
have a less favorable evolution than those that are 
ACPA-negative. 

IL-6  stimulates  the  activation  of  local  CD4+ T 
cells that, in turn, stimulate B cells to differentiate 
into  plasma  cells  that  produce  the  autoantibodies 
rheumatoid factor and ACPA. 

From a clinical perspective, rheumatoid arthritis 
cause  systemic  illness,  including  cardiovascular, 
pulmonary, and skeletal disorders caused by inﬂam-
matory mediators (cytokines and immune complexes) 
circulating in blood.

Essential concepts

Osteogenesis

• There are two processes of osteogenesis 
(bone formation or ossiﬁcation): 
  (1) Intramembranous bone formation.
  (2) Endochondral bone formation. 
  Both processes have a common aspect: the 
transformation of a primary trabecular network 
(also called primary spongiosa) into mature 
bone. However, they differ in the starting point: 
intramembranous bone formation consists in 
the transformation of a mesenchymal template 
into bone; endochondral ossiﬁcation consists 
in the replacement of preexisting hyaline carti-
lage template into bone. 

•  Intramembranous bone formation is 
characteristic of skull ﬂat bones. The following 
sequence is observed: 
  (1) Aggregates or mesenchymal condensa-
tions are formed in several sites.

 (2) Mesenchymal cells differentiate into os-
teoblasts to form the bone blastema originated 
by interstitial growth.
  (3) bone matrix or osteoid, containing type 
I collagen and noncollaginous proteins, is 
deposited by osteoblasts.
  (4) blood-borne calcium is deposited in the 
osteoid, which becomes calciﬁed (mineral-
ized).
  (5) osteoblasts become enclosed in the 
mineralized matrix and differentiate into 
osteocytes, connected to each other by cellular 
processes forming a network.
  (6) new osteoblasts appear along the surface 
of the primary bone tissue or primary ossiﬁca-
tion center, forming a trabecula. 
  Several trabeculae enlarge by appositional 
growth and fuse together to form woven bone. 
Note that intramembranous bone formation 

starts as interstitial growth and continues by 
appositional growth.  
  The ﬁnal steps include the conversion of 
woven bone in the outer and inner layers 
into compact or lamellar bone of haversian 
type (concentric lamellae around a space 
containing blood vessels). The center of the 
membranous bone remains as spongy bone, 
called diploë.  The external and internal con-
nective layers become the periosteum and 
endosteum, respectively.

• Endochondral bone formation is charac-
teristic of long bones, vertebral column, and 
pelvis. The following sequence is observed:
  (1) Chondrocytes in the center of the hya-
line cartilage template become hypertrophic 
and start synthesizing type X collagen, vascu-
lar endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF).

      5. OSTEOGENESIS

   (2) Blood vessels from the perichondrium 
invade the hypertrophic cartilage center, 
whose matrix becomes calciﬁed; the primary 
ossiﬁcation center is established.
  (3) The inner perichondrial cells form a thin 
periosteal collar at the midpoint of the shaft or 
diaphysis. The periosteal collar forms woven 
bone—by the intramembranous bone forma-
tion process—under the future periosteum.
  (4) Blood vessels invade the space formerly 
occupied by hypertrophic chondrocytes and 
preosteoblasts and hematopoietic cells arrive 
through the perivascular tissue.
  (5) Preosteoblasts differentiate into osteo-
blasts, which align along the calciﬁed cartilage 
matrix and begin to deposit osteoid forming 
stalactite-like spicules. The primary ossiﬁcation 
center now consists of two components: the 
periosteal collar and the center of ossiﬁcation 
in the interior of the cartilage template.

• Two steps will follow: 
  (1) The growth in length of the future long 
bone.
  (2) The development of secondary centers 
of ossiﬁcation in the epiphyses. 
  The growth in length of the long bones de-
pends on the interstitial growth of the hyaline 
cartilage while the center of the cartilage is be-
ing replaced by bone. The secondary centers 
of ossiﬁcation consist in the replacement of 
hyaline cartilage by spongy bone, except the 
articular cartilage and a thin disk, the epiphy-
seal growth plate, in the metaphyses (linking 
the diaphysis to the epiphyses). 
  The epiphyseal growth plate retains the 
capacity of chondrogenesis and, after puberty, 
is replaced by the epiphyseal line. Chondro-
genesis of the growth plate and the formation 
of the bony collar are regulated by Indian 
hedgehog (Ihh) secretory protein in a para-
crine manner. 
   Ihh, secreted by chondrocytes of the early 
hypertrophic  zone of the hyaline cartilage 
template adjacent to the growth plate, signal 

perichondrial cells to express RUNX2 and 
become osteoblast to continue forming the 
bony collar. In addition, Ihh stimulates the 
synthesis of parathyroid hormone-related 
peptide (PTH rP) by cells of the chondrogenic 
layer of the perichondrium.  
   PTHrP does two things: First, it binds to the 
PRHrP receptor on the surface of chon-
drocytes of the reserve zone of the growth 
plate to stimulate their proliferation; second, 
it binds to chondrocytes of the proliferative 
zone to prevent their hypertrophy. Essentially, 
PTHrP keeps the developmental potential of 
the growth plate active until the individual's 
programmed bone length has been com-
pleted.  

• Endochondral bone formation consists of 
four major histologic zones: 
  (1) The reserve zone, composed of hyaline 
cartilage “running away” from the “chasing” 
ossiﬁcation front, the vascular invasion zone 
and the bone resorptive activity of osteoclasts. 
  (2) The proliferative zone, characterized by 
the mitotic activity of chondrocytes, form-
ing stacks of isogenous groups, also running 
away from the chasing vascular invasion zone. 
  (3) The hypertrophic zone, the "facilitator" 
of the vascular invasion zone by producing 
VEGF, recruiting macrophage-like chondro-
clasts to destroy the calciﬁed cartilage matrix, 
and producing type X collagen, an imprint of 
their hypertrophic nature. 
  (4) The vascular invasion zone,  the site 
where blood vessels sprouts, penetrating 
the transverse calciﬁed cartilage septa, carry 
preosteoblasts and hematopoietic cells. A 
characteristic of this zone are the spicules, 
which will become trabeculae. 
  A spicule consists of a longitudinal core of 
calciﬁed cartilage coated by osteoid produced 
by osteoblasts lining the surface. A trabecula 
is an osteocyte lamellar core (instead of a 
calciﬁed cartilage core), covered by osteoblast 
depositing osteoid on the surface. 

  Trabeculae, built by osteoblasts and remod-
eled by osteoclasts, results in the formation of 
woven or cancellous bone. 
  Woven bone will change into a lamellar 
bone of the haversian system type using the 
blood vessel as the axial center for the con-
centric deposit and organization of lamellae.
   Recall that osteoblasts have two major 
tasks: to continue forming bone, until they 
become sequestered in the lacunae as osteo-
cytes, and to direct osteoclastogenesis by the 
RANK-RANKL signaling pathway.

• The conversion of bone trabeculae into 
osteons  consists in the following steps:
  Longitudinal ridges of a trabecula advance 
toward one another and enclose the perioste-
al blood vessel, creating a tunnel that houses 
a blood vessel. The blood vessels will become 
the center of a haversian system or osteon. 
Blood is supplied by transverse blood vessels 
occupying the Volkmanns's canals. Keep in 
mind that the haversian system has concentric 
lamellae; the Volkmann‘s canal does not. 
  Appositional bone growth continues under 
the periosteum to form the outer circumferen-
tial lamellae. Osteoblasts lining the endos-
teum form the inner circumferential lamellae, 
also by appositional bone growth. 
  The shaft or diaphysis grows in width by 
apposition consisting in new compact bone 
being laid down under the periosteum. At 
the same time, woven bone is gradually re-
absorbed at the inner side, or endosteum, of 
the shaft and the width of the marrow cavity 
increases. Consequently, the shaft becomes 
wider but the walls, formed by compact bone, 
does not increase signiﬁcantly in thickness. 
Keep in mind that woven bone, persisting 
at the endosteal surface, is lamellar but not 
haversian.

• Bone remodeling is a continuous and 
random process consisting in the replace-
ment of newly formed bone and old bone

by a resorption-production sequence involving 
the combined participation of osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts. 
  There are two forms of bone remodeling: 
  (1) Cortical bone remodeling.
  (2) Trabecular bone remodeling. 
  Cortical bone remodeling occurs in an old 
haversian system followed by the reorganiza-
tion of a new one. Osteoclasts begin eroding 
the lamella facing the central canal until they 
reach the outermost lamella. Residual lamellae 
of the ongoing degradation process are pushed 
in between the existing intact osteons, forming 
the interstitial lamellae. The osteoclasts disap-
pear and osteoblasts  begin the reconstruction 
process by constructing new lamellae from the 
periphery to the central canal where a blood 
vessel is located.   The starting point of the 
reconstruction of a new osteon is marked by 
the cement line, a structure that absorbs micro-
cracking created by load forces acting on bone.
  Trabecular bone remodeling follows the same 
osteoclast resorption and osteoclast-osteoblast 
reversal sequence. A major difference is that 
this process occurs on the bone surface 
instead of in an osteon.

• Bone fractures take place when pathologic 
and traumatic fractures occur.
  Fractures can be: 
  (1) Complete fractures (when the bone frag-
ments are separated from each other). 
  (2) Comminuted fractures (when a complete 
fracture produces bones broken into more than 
two fragments). 
  (3) Open or compound fractures (when the 
fractured bone ends penetrates the skin and 
soft tissues). 
  (4) Simple or closed fractures (when the skin 
and soft tissues are intact).
   A few type of fractures are designated by 
speciﬁc names. For example, Pott's fracture 
consists in the fracture of the distal end of the 
ﬁbula and injury to the distal end of the tibia. 
Colles' fracture is the fracture of the radius 
close to the wrist.
  The healing of a fracture involves the follow-
ing phases: 
  (1) Hematoma/inﬂammatory phase. Bleed-
ing and an inﬂammatory process lead to the 
formation of temporary granulation tissue 
during the ﬁrst week after fracture. The bone 
fragments are connected and proper immobili-
zation is required. 
  (2) Reparative phase (soft callus). A soft 
noncalciﬁed cartilagenous callus connects the 
two ends of the fractured bone. 

  (3) Reparative phase (hard bone callus). 
Osteoblasts deposit osteoid that is calciﬁed 
and woven bone is formed. 
  (4) Remodeling phase (2 to 3 months after 
the injury). Excess material of the bone callus 
is removed by osteoclasts and woven bone is 
replaced by lamellar compact bone.

•  Metabolic and hereditary bone disorders 
include:
   Rickets (children) and osteomalacia (adults) 
are a group of bone diseases characterized 
by a defect in the mineralization of the bone 
matrix (osteoid), most often caused by a lack 
of vitamin D3.  
  Osteopetrosis includes a group of hereditary 
diseases characterized by abnormal or nonex-
isting osteoclast function. A clinical variant, au-
tosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO), also 
known as Albers-Schönberg disease, is caused 
by mutations in the CICN7 gene encoding the 
chloride channel in osteoclasts.
  Osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disease 
in which the osteoclast-driven bone degrada-
tion process is not fully compensated by the 
same bone production volume by osteoblasts.  
  Fibrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva (FOP) 
is an inherited disorder of the connective 
tissue consisting in the aberrant ossiﬁcation 
of muscle tissue and connective tissue and 
skeletal malformations. A mutation in the 
receptor ACVR1 (activin receptor type 1A) 
of bone morphogenetic protein leads to the 
unregulated activation of the receptor and the 
deposit of bone in nonskeletal tissues.
   Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic 
disorder deﬁned by fragile bones and fractures 
("brittlebone disease"). Additional defects 
include hearing loss, scoliosis, curved long 
bones, blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta 
and short stature. This condition is caused 
by a dominant mutation to genes encoding 
type I collagen (COL1A1 [(cid:95)-1 chain peptide] 
or COL1A2 [(cid:95)-2 chain peptide]). Missense 
mutations leading to a defective peptide chain 
results in abnormalities in most of the collagen 
triple helix.

• Joints can be classiﬁed into:
  (1) Synarthroses, which permit little or no 
movement.
  (2) Amphiarthroses, which enable slight 
movement.
  (3) Diarthroses, which permit free move-
ment. 
   A diarthrodial joint consists of a vascularized 
outer layer of dense connective tissue capsule 

continuous with the periosteum. The capsule 
surrounds the joint and encloses the synovial 
cavity, containing ﬂuid produced by the lining 
cells of the synovial membrane. 

• Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inﬂam-
matory and destructive autoimmune disease 
of the joints of unknown cause. 
  Synovitis, the inﬂammatory process of the 
synovial membrane, occurs when leukocytes 
inﬁltrate the synovial compartment. The 
production of cytokines by synovial cells is a 
key factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
   A proliferative process (hyperplasia) of the 
synovial cell lining, together with a loss in 
the expression of synovial protective lubricin, 
causes the destruction of the articular carti-
lage by apoptosis of chondrocytes, followed 
by destruction of the subjacent bone. 
   Bone erosion, a result from osteoclast 
invading the periosteum adjacent to the 
articular surface, is detected in 80% of the 
affected patients within 1 year after diag-
nosis. Osteoclasts are activated by synovial 
cytokines.
   Synovitis occurs when leukocytes inﬁltrate 
the synovial compartment. The initial event is 
triggered by the activation of CD4+ T cells by 
an undetermined antigen. 
  CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells 
induce the villus-like proliferation of synovial 
cells (called pannus) and the production 
of tumor necrosis factor ligand, interleu-
kins, collagenases, and metalloproteinases 
(proinﬂammatory effectors), which continue 
triggering an inﬂammatory response by 
synovial cells.
  Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by the 
production of autoantibodies:
  (1) Rheumatoid factor.
  (2) Anti-citrullinated protein antibody 
(ACPA). 
   Rheumatoid factor is a highly afﬁnity auto-
antibody against the Fc domain of immuno-
globulins. Rheumatoid factor has a dual role: 
  (1) It is a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid 
arthritis 
  (2) It also has participates in its pathogen-
esis. 
   A post-translational conversion of the 
amino acid arginine into citrulline modi-
ﬁes the folding of citrullinated proteins that 
become a selective target of the immune 
system.  ACPA-positive patients disease have 
a less favorable evolution than those that are 
ACPA-negative.

Blood, a specialized type of connective tissue, consists of plasma, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Blood 
offers valuable diagnostic information about normal body functions and pathologic alterations because of its 
biochemical composition and easy access. Hematopoiesis, the self-renewal and differentiation of multipotent 
stem cells in bone marrow, is responsible for the release of end-stage mature cells into the blood circulation (~1 
x 109 erythrocytes and ~1 x 108 leukocytes every hour). Bone marrow microenvironments, or niches, enable 
colonies of hematopoietic cells to fullﬁl their commitment of producing and maintaining a steady number of 
mature cell populations and platelets in blood. This chapter describes the structural and functional characteris-
tics of blood cells, their development, and the distribution of progenitor cells in speciﬁc hematopoietic niches.  

Blood
Blood  consists  of  cells  and  plasma.   These  com-
ponents  may  be  separated  by  centrifugation  when 
blood is collected in the presence of anticoagulants. 
The sedimented red blood cells (RBCs) constitute 
about 42%–47% of blood volume. This percentage 
of  erythrocyte  volume  is  the  hematocrit  (Greek, 
haima, blood; krino, to separate). Sitting on top of 
the erythrocyte layer is the buffy coat layer, which 
contains leukocytes (Greek leukos, white; kytos, cell) 
and platelets.  The translucent supernatant fraction 
above  the  packed  RBCs  is  plasma.  Normal  adult 
blood volume measures 5 to 6 L.

Plasma
Plasma  is  the  ﬂuid  component  of  blood  (Figure 
6-1). Plasma contains salts and organic compounds 
(including  amino  acids,  lipids,  vitamins,  proteins, 
and  hormones).  In  the  absence  of  anticoagulants,

Blood collected without

proteins (mostly ﬁbrinogen), form a clot in the test 
tube. The ﬂuid portion is called serum, which is es-
sentially ﬁbrinogen-free plasma.

Red blood cells (erythrocytes) 
RBCs, also called erythrocytes (Greek erythros, red; 
kytos,  cell),  are  non-nucleated,  biconcave-shaped 
cells measuring about 7.8 (cid:43)m in diameter (unﬁxed). 
RBCs lack organelles and consist only of a plasma 
membrane, its underlying cytoskeleton (Figure 6-2), 
hemoglobin, and glycolytic enzymes. 

RBCs (average number: 4 to 6 × 106 per mm3) cir-
culate for 120 days. Senescent RBCs are removed by 
phagocytosis or destroyed by hemolysis in the spleen. 
RBCs are replaced in the circulation by reticulocytes, 
which  complete  their  hemoglobin  synthesis  and 
maturation 1 to 2 days after entering the circulation. 
Reticulocytes account for 1% to 2% of circulating 
RBCs. RBCs transport oxygen and carbon dioxide 
and are conﬁned to the circulatory system.

Pathology: RBC cytoskeletal and hemoglobin 
abnormalities
The main determinant of anemia in hemolytic ane-
mias is RBC destruction. Normal RBC destruction 
takes  place  in  spleen  but  acute  and  chronic  RBC 
hemolysis occurs within blood vessels as the result of  
membrane cytoskeleton, metabolic or hemoglobin 
abnormalities.  

1.  Defects  of  the  membrane  cytoskeleton:  El-
liptocytosis and spherocytosis are alterations in the 
shape of RBCs caused by defects in the membrane 
cytoskeleton. Elliptocytosis, an autosomal dominant 
disorder characterized by the presence of oval-shaped 
RBCs, is caused by defective self-association of spec-
trin subunits, defective binding of spectrin to ankyrin, 
protein 4.1 defects, and abnormal glycophorin (see 
Figure 6-2). 

Spherocytosis  is  also  an  autosomal  dominant 
condition involving a deﬁciency in spectrin. RBCs 
are spherical, of different diameter and many of them

Protein 4.1 links the actin-tropomyosin complex to    
glycophorin.
   Adducin is a calmodulin-binding protein that 
stimulates the association of actin with spectrin.

Spectrin

Spectrin is a large dimeric protein consisting of two 
polypeptides: (1) spectrin (cid:95) (240 kd); and (2) spectrin (cid:96) 
(220 kd).
    The two polypeptides associate in antiparallel pairs to form 
a rod about 100 nm long.
    Two chains join head to head to form a tetramer, found in 
the cortical region of the red blood cell.  
    In hereditary spherocytosis (HS), RBCs are spheroidal, 
less rigid, of variable diameter and subject to destruction in 
the spleen.  This alteration is caused by cytoskeletal 
abnormalities involving sites of interactions between spectrin 
(cid:95) and (cid:96) and protein 4.1.

Micrographs from Hoffbrand AV, Pettit JE: Color Atlas of Clinical Hematology, 3rd ed., London, Mosby, 2000.

lack the typical central pale area seen in normal RBCs 
(see Figure 6-2). The common clinical features of el-
liptocytosis and spherocytosis are anemia, jaundice 
(resulting  from  increased  bilirubin  production), 
and  splenomegaly  (enlargement  of  the  spleen). 
Splenectomy is usually curative, because the spleen 
is the primary site responsible for the destruction of 
elliptocytes and spherocytes.

2. Metabolic defects: Normal RBCs produce en-
ergy to maintain cell shape, electrolyte and water con-
tent by metabolizing glucose through the glycolytic 
(Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway) and pentose 
phosphate (hexose monophosphate shunt) pathways.
The most abundant phosphate in RBC is 2,3-di-
phosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), involved in the release 
of  oxygen  from  hemoglobin. The  enzyme  glucose 
6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (G6PD)  protects  the 
membrane and  hemoglobin from oxidant damage, 
a frequent metabolic cause of intravascular hemoly-
sis caused by severe infection, hepatitis or diabetic 
ketoacidosis  observed    in  the  presence  of  G6PD 
deﬁciency.  Pyruvate  kinase  deﬁciency  is  another 
metabolic defect found in hemolytic anemia.

3.  Hemoglobin  defects:  Hemoglobin  genetic 
defects ((cid:95)2(cid:96)S2 ) cause sickle cell anemia and thalas-
semia (Greek thalassa, sea; observed in populations 
along the Greek and Italian coasts). Sickle cell anemia
results  from  a  point  mutation  in  which  glutamic 
acid is replaced by valine at the sixth position in the 
(cid:96)-globin chain.  

Defective hemoglobin (Hb S) tetramers aggregate 
and  polymerize    in  deoxygenated  RBCs,  changing 
the biconcave disk shape into a rigid and less deform-
able sickle-shaped cell. Hb S leads to severe chronic 
hemolytic anemia and obstruction of postcapillary 
venules  (see  Spleen  in  Chapter  10,  Immune-Lym-
phatic System). 

Thalassemia  syndromes  are  heritable  anemias 
characterized by defective synthesis of either the (cid:95) or 
(cid:96)(cid:3)chains of the normal hemoglobin tetramer ((cid:95)2(cid:96)2). 
The  speciﬁc  thalassemia  syndromes  are  designated 
by  the  affected  globin  chain:  (cid:95)-thalassemia  and(cid:3)
(cid:96)-thalassemia. 

Thalassemia  syndromes  are  deﬁned  by  anemia 
caused  by  defective  synthesis  of  the  hemoglobin 
molecule and hemolysis.

Clinical  signiﬁcance:  Hemoglobin  A1c  (glycated

A  valuable  clinical  indicator  of  average  plasma 
glucose concentration is the measurement of hemo-
globin A1c (glycohemoglobin or glycated [coated]
hemoglobin). Glucose links to hemoglobin A1 in a 
non-enzymatic irreversible reaction. 

The  normal  range  for  the  hemoglobin  A1c  is 
between  4%  and  5.6%.  Hemoglobin  A1c  levels 
between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of 
diabetes mellitus, and levels of 6.5% or higher in-
dicate diabetes mellitus. Determination of glycated 
hemoglobin is an efﬁcient way to assess pre-diabetes 
or diabetes mellitus conditions as well as the treat-

 Box 6-A | Hemolysis in erythroblastosis fetalis

•  The hemolytic process in erythroblastosis fetalis causes hemolytic anemia 
and jaundice.
•  Hemolytic anemia causes hypoxic injury to the heart and liver, leading to 
generalized edema (hydrops fetalis; Greek hydrops, edema).

ment  to  achieve  long-term  regulation  of  serum 
glucose  levels  to  prevent  cardiovascular,  renal,  and 
retinal complications. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Erythroblastosis fetalis
Erythroblastosis fetalis is an antibody-induced hemo-
lytic disease in the newborn that is caused by blood 
group  incompatibility  between  mother  and  fetus 
(Figure 6-3 and Box 6-A). This incompatibility occurs 
when the fetus inherits RBC antigenic determinants 
that are foreign to the mother.  ABO and Rh blood 
group antigens are of particular interest. 

Essentially, the mother becomes sensitized to blood 
group antigens on red blood cells, which can reach 
maternal circulation during the last trimester of preg-
nancy (when the cytotrophoblast is no longer present 
as a barrier, as we discuss in Chapter 23, Fertilization, 
Placentation,  and  Lactation)  or  during  childbirth.  
Within the Rh system, D antigen is the major cause 
of  Rh  incompatibility. The  initial  exposure  to  the 
Rh antigen during the ﬁrst pregnancy does not cause 
erythroblastosis fetalis because immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) is produced. IgMs cannot cross the placenta 
because of their large size.

Neutrophils represent 50% to 70% of total 
leukocytes (the most abundant leukocyte in a 
normal blood smear).  They measure 12 to 15 
(cid:43)m in diameter with a very pale pink cytoplasm 
(close in color to the erythrocyte). 
   Neutrophils contain primary granules that 
can barely be resolved, and smaller specific 
(secondary) granules.

segmented into three to five indented lobes.

Neutrophils, so called because of the appearance 
of their cytoplasmic granules following

infection where they recognize and phagocytose 
bacteria.  Migration and ingestion require 
substances contained in the cytoplasmic 
granules. 
    Primary (or azurophilic)

defensins,  and 
myeloperoxidase. 
    Secondary (or specific) 
granules contain lysozyme, 
lactoferrin, gelatinase, and

properties of secondary 
granules are responsible for 
the cytoplasmic light-colored 
appearance.

sensitization to Rh antigens.

Leukocytes 
Leukocytes (6 to 10 × 103 per mm3; see Box 6-B) 
are  categorized  as  either  granulocytes  (containing 
primary,  and  specific  or  secondary  cytoplasmic 
granules,  Box  6-C)  or  agranulocytes  (containing 
only primary granules). 

In response to an appropriate stimulus, leukocytes 
may  leave  the  bloodstream  (diapedesis)  and  enter 
the connective tissue by the homing mechanism (see 
Figure 6-9).

Granulocytes
These phagocytic cells have a multilobed nucleus and 
measure 12 to 15 (cid:43)m in diameter. Their average lifes-
pan varies with cell type. Three types of granulocytes 
can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic granules:

 Box 6-C  | Primary and speciﬁc granules 

•  Primary and speciﬁc (secondary) granules contain enzymes. Tertiary 
granules have been described; they produce proteins (cathepsin and gelatin-
ase), which enable neutrophils to attach to other cells and aid the process of 
phagocytosis.
•  Peroxidase is a marker enzyme of primary granules. The presence of 
alkaline phosphatase and a lack of peroxidase characterize the secondary 
granules. 
•  Why are primary granules azurophilic with the Wright blood stain method? 
Because primary granules contain sulfated glycoproteins that presumably ac-
count for this deep-blue (azure) staining.

a  multilobed  nucleus.   Their  cytoplasm  contains 
secondary (speciﬁc) and primary granules (see Box 
6-C). In stained smears, neutrophils appear very pale 
pink. Neutrophils, which constitute 50% to 70% of 
circulating leukocytes, have a lifespan of 6 to 7 hours 
and may live for up to 4 days in the connective tissue.
After leaving the circulation through postcapillary 
venules, neutrophils act to eliminate opsonized bac-
teria or limit the extent of an inﬂammatory reaction 
in the connective tissue. The mechanism of bacterial 
opsonization  and  the  relevant  role  of  neutrophils 
in acute inﬂammation are discussed in Chapter 10,

Basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules with

as heparin. They stain dark blue with the

   Basophils, similar to mast cells in the 
connective tissue, express on their surface IgE 
receptors (Fc(cid:161)R1) but differ in the expression of 
c-kit receptor and CD49b. Both release 
histamine to mediate allergic reactions when 
activated by antigen binding.
   An increase in the number of basophils (more 
than 150 basophils/(cid:43)L) is called basophilia and is 
observed in acute hypersensitivity reactions, viral 
infections, and chronic inflammatory conditions, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

Cytoplasmic 

granules

granules (lactoferrin, gelatinase, lysozyme and other 
proteases), speciﬁc receptors for C5a (produced by 
the  complement  system  pathway,  see  Chapter  10, 
Immune-Lymphatic  System),  and  L-selectin,  and 
integrins (with binding afﬁnity to endothelial cell li-
gands such as intercellular-adhesion molecules 1 and 
2 [ICAM-1 and ICAM-2]) enable the antibacterial 
and homing function of neutrophils (see Figure 6-9). 
2. Eosinophils (Figure 6-5).  Eosinophils have a 
characteristic  bilobed  nucleus. Their  cytoplasm  is 
ﬁlled with large, refractile granules that stain red in 
blood smears and tissue sections. The various com-
ponents of the eosinophil granules and other secre-
tory molecules are listed in Figure 6-5. Eosinophil 
degranulation occurs in response to cytokines (such 
as interferon-(cid:97) and chemokine ligand 11, CCL11) 
binding  to  eosinophil  surface  receptors.  Cytokine 
interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a major regulator of eosino-
phil function.

Eosinophils  constitute  1%  to  5%  of  circulating 
leukocytes  and  have  a  half-life  of  about  18  hours. 

Eosinophils  leave  the  circulation,  recruited  to  the 
connective  tissue  by  IL-5. These  cells  are  the  ﬁrst 
line of defense against parasites and also participate 
in triggering bronchial asthma (see Figure 6-10 and 
Chapter 13, Respiratory System).  

3.  Basophils  (Figure  6-6). These  granulocytes 
contain large, metachromatic cytoplasmic granules 
that often obscure the bilobed nucleus. 

Basophils represent only 1% of circulating leuko-
cytes. Basophils complete their maturation in bone 
marrow. In contrast, mast cells enter connective tissue 
or  mucosae  as  immature  cells  lacking  cytoplasmic 
granules. In addition, basophils and mast cells differ 
in  the  presence  of  c-kit  receptor  and  CD49b  but 
share Fc(cid:161)R1: basophils are c-kit-Fc(cid:161)R1+ CD49b+; 
mast cells are c-kit+Fc(cid:161)R1+CD49b-.

Basophils have a short lifespan (about 60 hours), 
whereas mast cells survive for weeks and months. The 
relationship between basophil and mast cell lineages 
is further discussed in the Hematopoiesis section of 
this chapter.

Figure 6-7. Lymphocyte

Lymphocytes are relatively abundant, 
accounting for 20% to 40% of total 
leukocytes.  In circulating blood, 
lymphocytes may range from 
approximately 7 to12 (cid:43)m in diameter.  
However, the typical lymphocyte in a 
normal blood smear is small, about the 
size of a red blood cell.  
    The nucleus of a small lymphocyte is 
densely stained, with a round or slightly 
indented shape (pointer).  The nucleus 
occupies most of the cell, reducing the 
cytoplasm to a thin basophilic rim. 
    Large lymphocytes have a round, 
slightly indented nucleus surrounded by 
a pale cytoplasm.  Occasionally, a few 
primary granules (lysosomes) may be 
present.

Small lymphocyte 

Large lymphocytes 

Small lymphocytes represent 97% of the population of circulating 
lymphocytes. Note that the nucleus is surrounded by a thin 
cytoplasmic rim. Large lymphocytes represent 3% of the 
population of circulating lymphocytes. 
    Lymphocytes are divided into two categories: B lymphocytes, 
produced in the bone marrow, and T lymphocytes, also produced 
in the bone marrow but that complete their maturation in the 
thymus. 

    A less abundant class is the natural killer cell. 
    During fetal development, the yolk sac, liver, and spleen are 
sites where lymphocytes originate. In postnatal life, the bone 
marrow and thymus are the primary lymphoid organs where 
lymphocytes develop before they are exposed to antigens.
    Secondary lymphoid organs are the lymph nodes, the 
spleen, and lymphoid aggregates of the gastrointestinal and 
respiratory tracts.

Basophils  play  a  role  in  immediate  (bronchial 
asthma) and type 2 hypersensitivity in response to 
allergens (allergic skin reaction) and parasitic worms 
(helminths).  

Figure 6-8. Monocyte

Monocytes (2% to 8% of total 
leukocytes) are the largest 
leukocytes, ranging in size from 15 
to 20 (cid:43)m.  
    The eccentrically placed nucleus 
is typically kidney shaped and 
contains fine strands of chromatin.
    The abundant cytoplasm stains 
pale gray-blue and is filled with 
small lysosomes that give a fine, 
granular appearance.
    Monocytes travel briefly in the 
bloodstream and then enter the 
peripheral tissue where they are 
transformed into macrophages and 
survive a longer time.  
Macrophage-derived monocytes are 
more efficient phagocytic cells than 
neutrophils.

Agranulocytes
Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes. 
Agranulocytes  have  a  round  or  indented  nucleus. 
They contain only lysosomal-type, primary granules.  
Lymphocytes are either large (3% of lymphocytes; 
7 to 12 (cid:43)m) or small (97% of lymphocytes; 6 to 8 
(cid:43)m (Figure  6-7) cells. In either case, the nucleus is 
round and may be slightly indented. The cytoplasm 
is basophilic, often appearing as a thin rim around 
the nucleus (see Figure 6-7). A few primary granules 
may be present. Lymphocytes may live for a few days 
or several years. 

Lymphocytes are divided into two categories: 
1. B lymphocytes (also called B cells) are produced 
and  mature  in  bone  marrow.    Antigen-stimulated 
B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma 
cells. 

2. T lymphocytes (also called T cells) are produced 
in bone marrow but complete their maturation in the 
thymus. Activated T cells participate in cell-mediated 
immunity  (for additional details, see Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System). 

Monocytes  (Figure  6-8)  can  measure  15  to  20 
(cid:43)m in diameter. Their nucleus is kidney shaped or 
oval. Cytoplasmic granules are small and may not be 
resolved on light microscopy.

interaction is mediated in part by 
intercellular adhesion molecules 
ICAM-1 on the endothelium and LFA-1 
(lymphocyte function–associated 
antigen 1) and MAC1 (cid:8)(cid:95)M(cid:96)2 
integrin/macrophage antigen 1). 

      Transendothelial migration
3
Neutrophils migrate across the 
endothelium along an IL-8 
concentration gradient produced by 
phagocytic neutrophils. CD99 
contributes to diapedesis by 
up-regulating laminin-binding (cid:95)6(cid:96)1 
integrin. Infiltrating neutrophils disrupt  
the interaction of junctional adhesion 
molecules (JAM) and vascular 
endothelial cadherins (VE-cadherin).

Monocytes circulate in blood for 12 to 100 hours 
and then enter the connective tissue. In the connec-
tive tissue, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, 
which are involved in bacterial phagocytosis, antigen 
presentation,  and  clean-up  of  dead  cell  debris.  In 
bone, monocytes differentiate into osteoclasts under 
the control of osteoblasts (see Chapter 4, Connec-
tive Tissue).

Pathology: Leukemias
Leukemias are the most common neoplastic diseases 
of leukocytes.  They are characterized by the neoplas-
tic proliferation of one or more cell lineages in bone 
marrow,  frequent  circulation  of  neoplastic  cells  in 
peripheral blood and reduction in the development 
of normal red blood cells and platelets.

There    are  acute  and  chronic  leukemias.  Acute 
leukemias consist in the massive proliferation of im-
mature cells with respect to bone marrow cells and 
rapid progression of the disease.  

Acute leukemias are classiﬁed as acute lymphoblas-
tic leukemias (ALL), when derived from lymphoid 
cells and  acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML), when 
derived from myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic 
cell progenies. 

Anemia (caused by a depletion of red blood cell 
formation), infections (determined by a decline in 

the  formation  of  normal  leukocytes)  and  bleeding 
(a reduction in the number of platelets) are relevant 
features. 

The diagnosis is based on the microscopic exami-
nation of bone marrow samples. ALL affects mainly 
children; AML affects adults.

The French-American-British (FAB) classiﬁcation, 
includes different types of acute leukemias according 
to  the  degree  of  cell  differentiation  determined  by 
the cytochemical detection of cell markers: L1 to L3 
(lymphoid–ALL) and M1 to M7 (myeloid–AML).

Chronic leukemias are classiﬁed as lymphocytic, 
myeloid  and  hairy-cell  type  leukemias. They  are 
characterized  by  a  lesser  proliferation  of  immature 
cells and slow progression of the disease. 

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  is mainly 
observed in adults (50 years and older). A predomi-
nant proliferation of B cells and a large number of 
abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood are pre-
dominant features. Lymphoadenopathy and spleno-
megaly are a common clinical ﬁndings. 

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is regarded as a 
myeloproliferative condition (proliferation of abnor-
mal bone marrow stem cells) affecting adults. Patients 
develop hepatosplenomegaly and leukocytosis (exces-
sive myelocytes, metamyelocytes and neutrophils in 
peripheral blood). After a chronic phase of about ﬁve

years, the disease can change into an acute leukemia, 
requiring stem cell bone marrow transplantation. 

Patients with CML usually have the Philadelphia 
chromosome,  a  reciprocal  translocation  between 
the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, designated  
t(9;22)(q34;q11). A fusion gene is created by plac-
ing the abl gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to 
a  part  of  the  bcr  (breakpoint  cluster  region)  gene 
on chromosome 22 (region q11). The fusion gene 
(abl/bcr) encodes a tyrosine kinase involved in cell 
transformation  leading  to  a  neoplastic  phenotype. 
The drug imatinib is a speciﬁc  tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tor. We come back to imatinib and tyrosine kinases 
inhibition at the end of this chapter.

Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare type of B cell 
leukemia. The cells look hairy because of multiple 
thin cytoplasmic projections. Splenomegaly, lymph-
adenopathy,  and  recurrent  infections  are  common 
ﬁndings. A relationship between HCL and exposure 
to the herbicide Agent Orange has been recorded.

 

General  Pathology:  Leukocyte  recruitment  and 
inﬂammation
We have studied in Chapter 1, Epithelium, the mo-

lecular  principles of homing (or leukocyte recruit-
ment).  We  now  expand  the  concept  of  leukocyte 
recruitment by studying the mechanism of migration 
of phagocytic neutrophils to the site of infection and 
inﬂammation (Figure 6-9). 

Rapid  movement of circulating leukocytes across 
post-capillary venular walls from the bloodstream to 
the connective tissue in response to injury and infec-
tion is essential to the actions of the immune system. 
Neutrophil recruitment takes place at permissive sites, 
marked by chemotactic factors released by pathogen-
derived endotoxins and guided by host chemokines 
bound to endothelial cell surfaces. 

The ﬁrst step is the binding of carbohydrate ligands 
on the surface of the neutrophil to endothelial selec-
tins (E selectin). Binding determines rolling and adhe-
sion of the neutrophil to an endothelial cell surface. 
The second step, crawling and transendothelial mi-
gration, demands a stronger interaction of neutrophil 
with the endothelium. This interaction is mediated by 
the activation integrins by the neutrophil.  Integrin 
LFA-1 (also known as (cid:95)L(cid:96)2 integrin or lymphocyte 
function–associated  antigen  1)  and  MAC1  (also 
known as (cid:95)M(cid:96)2 integrin or macrophage antigen 1) 
interacts with ICAM-1 on the endothelial cell surface.  
Note that (cid:96)2 integrin subunit is common to LFA-1 
and  MAC1.  ICAM-1  is  induced  by  inﬂammatory 
cytokines tumor necrosis factor ligand and interleu-
kin-1(cid:96)(cid:3)(IL-1(cid:96)) produced by activated macrophages 
present at the site of inﬂammation. 

Preparing  neutrophils  for  squeezing  between 
adjacent  endothelial  cells  (paracellular  migration) 
or  through  endothelial  cells  (transcellular  migra-
tion),  requires  the  chemoattractant  interleukin-8. 
It is produced by inﬂammatory cells (for example, 
neutrophils).

Transendothelial migration, or diapedesis, is fa-
cilitated by disrupting the interaction of endothelial 
cell adhesion molecules such as junctional adhesion 
molecules (JAMs), vascular endothelial cell cadherin
(VE-cadherin)  and  CD99. The  up-regulation  of 
(cid:95)6(cid:96)1  integrin  by  CD99,  produced  by  endothe-
lial cells, facilitates penetration of the vascular basal 
membrane and the smooth muscle cell layer. After 
breaching the basement membrane and the smooth 
muscle cell layer, neutrophil display motility involving 
membrane protrusions and the rearrangement of the 
actin cytoskeleton. 

In the acute inﬂammation site, neutrophils migrate 
in an ameboid fashion that is intrinsic and relatively 
independent from the inﬂammation environment. A 
detailed account of the contribution of neutrophils 
to acute inﬂammation is presented in Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System.

actions and integrins (mostly (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 integrins) 
are  required  for  the  transendothelial  migration  of 
leukocytes  across  a  venule  wall  into  extravascular 
areas of inﬂammation.

Three leukocyte adhesion deﬁciencies have been 
described, both characterized by a defect in wound 
healing,  recurrent  infections,  fever  and  marked 
leukocytosis (increase in the number of leukocytes 
in blood). 

Leukocyte  adhesion  deﬁciency  type  I  (LAD  I) 
is caused by a defect of the (cid:96)2 subunit (also called  
CD18) present in LFA-1 and MAC1 integrins. As a 
consequence, neutrophils are unable to leave blood 
vessels because of a defect in the recruitment mecha-

nism. As you recall, LFA-1 and MAC1 are required 
for binding to endothelial ICAM1, a necessary step 
for transendothelial migration. In these patients, in-
ﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates are devoid of neutrophils. A 
delay in the separation of the umbilical cord at birth 
is a classic indication of LAD I.

In leukocyte adhesion deﬁciency type II (LAD II), 
the fucosyl-containing ligands for selectins are ab-
sent due to a hereditary defect of endogenous fucose 
metabolism. Individuals with LAD II have reduced 
intrauterine or postnatal growth and severe mental 
retardation recognized shortly after birth. LAD III 
is  determined  by  mutations  in  kindlin  (associated 
with the intracellular domain of (cid:96) integrin subunit).

Pathology:  Mast  cell–eosinophil  interaction  in 
asthma
We have already seen that mast cells and eosinophils 
are immigrant cells of the connective tissue. These 
two cell types have a signiﬁcant role in the patho-
genesis of asthma.

Asthma, a condition in which extrinsic (allergens) 
or intrinsic (unknown) factors trigger reversible air-
way obstruction and airway hyperreactivity, provides 
a good example of mast cell–eosinophil interaction. 
Eosinophils are recruited to the bronchial mucosa 
by cytokine IL-5 released from activated TH2 cells (a 
subset of helper T lymphocytes). IL-5 binds to inter-
leukin-5 receptor subunit-(cid:95) (IL-5R(cid:95)(cid:9) on eosinophils 
to induce their degranulation. 

Two IL-5-speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies, mepo-
lizumab and reslizumab, block the binding of IL-5 
to IL-5R(cid:95). Initial clinical trials show that these anti-
bodies, administered together with steroids,(cid:3)decrease(cid:3)
by 50% the number of eosinophils in the bronchial 
mucosa and by 0% in sputum. These observations 
stress the signiﬁcance of IL-5 in eosinophilic asthma 
pathogenesis. 

There is bidirectional signaling between mast cells 
and  eosinophils  in  the  bronchial  mucosa  (Figure 
6-10). 

Mast  cells  and  eosinophils  release  mediators  to 
enhance mucus hypersecretion (leading to the for-
mation of  mucus plugs), edema and bronchocon-
striction  (determining  with  time  hypertrophy  and 
hyperplasia of the bronchiolar smooth muscle layer). 
Bronchoconstriction  causes  airway  narrowing  and 
interference of air ﬂow.

Pathology: Eosinophilic esophagitis

Eosinophils are usually found in the gastrointes-
tinal tract, predominantly in the cecum, but seldom 
in the esophagus. However, esophageal dysfunction, 
including dysphagia and abdominal pain, correlates 
with  the  increase  of  eosinophils  in  the  esophageal 
mucosa. 

Dysregulated eosinophilia appears to depend on 
the excessive production of IL-5 and IL-13 by TH2 

 Box 6-D  | Hemophilia

•  Hemophilia is a common hereditary disease associated with serious bleeding 
due to an inherited deﬁciency of factor VIII or factor IX. 
 •  The genes for these blood coagulation factors lie on the X chromosome, and 
when mutated, they cause the X-linked recessive traits of hemophilia A and B. 
Hemophilia affects males, with females as carriers.  
•  A reduction in the amount or activity of factor VIII, a protein synthesized in the 
liver, causes hemophilia A.  A deﬁciency in factor IX determines hemophilia B.  
•  Major trauma or surgery can determine severe bleeding in all hemophiliacs and, 
therefore, a correct diagnosis is critical. Plasma-derived or genetically engineered 
recombinant factors are available for the treatment of patients with hemophilia. 
•  von Willebrand’s disease, the most frequent bleeding disorder, is also heredi-
tary and related to a deﬁcient or abnormal von Willebrand’s factor. 

cells and the presence of the eosinophil chemoattrac-
tant chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26) in the inﬂamma-
tory area of the esophagus. 

Fungal  and  insect  allergens  appear  to  trigger 
eosinophilic  esophagitis. The  treatment  consists  in 
controlling with steroids the inﬂammatory associated 
process and blocking IL-5 with the speciﬁc monoclo-
nal antibody mepolizumab.

Platelets
Platelets are small (2 to 4 (cid:43)m) cytoplasmic discoid 
fragments derived from the megakaryocyte (Figure 
6-11) under the control of  thrombopoietin, a 35- to 
70-kd glycoprotein produced in the kidneys and liver.
 Megakaryocytes develop cytoplasmic projections 
that  become  proplatelets,  which  fragment  into 
platelets. This differentiation process takes 7 to 10 
days. Platelets bind and degrade thrombopoietin, a 
mechanism that regulates platelet production.

The plasma membrane is  coated by glycoprotein 
1b (GP1b) and GP2b-GP3a, involved in the attach-
ment of platelets to von Willebrand’s factor. Adhesion 
of platelets to the vascular endothelium, in turn, is 
mediated by von Willebrand’s factor that also carries 
factor VIII  coagulation  factor,  whereas  ﬁbrinogen 
binds to GP2b-GP3a  (see Figure 6-11).

The plasma membrane of a platelet invaginates to 
form  a  system  of  cytoplasmic  channels,  called  the 
invaginated membrane system, an arrangement that 
enables  the  adsorption  of  clotting  factors  and  also 
serves as conduits for the release of secretory  products 
stored  in  granules  in  thrombin-activated  platelets. 
Integrin (cid:95)2(cid:96)1 is present in the plasma membrane.
The  central  region  of  the  platelet,  the  granulo-
mere,  contains  mitochondria,  rough  endoplasmic 
reticulum,  the  Golgi  apparatus,  and  three  distinct 
types of granules:

1. Alpha ((cid:95)) granules, that store proteins involved 
in hemostatic functions, including platelet adhesion 
(ﬁbrinogen,  thrombospondin,  vitronectin,  laminin 
and  von  Willebrand  factor),  blood  coagulation 
(plasminogen  and  (cid:95)2-plasmin  inhibitor),  growth 
factors  for  endothelial  cell  repair  (platelet-derived 
growth factor [PDGF], transforming growth factor-
(cid:95) [TGF-(cid:95)] and TGF-(cid:96)) and microbicidal proteins 
(thrombocidins and kinocidins).

2. Dense ((cid:98)) core granules, containing mediators 
of vascular tone (serotonin, adenosine diphosphate 
[ADP] and phosphate). 

3. Lysosomal ((cid:104)) granules, containing hydrolytic 
enzymes participating in the dissolution of thrombi.
The periphery of the platelet, the hyalomere, con-
tains microtubules and microﬁlaments that regulate 
platelet  shape  change,  motility  toward  the  sites  of 
injury and infection and release of granule contents.
We indicate that alpha granules contain microbi-
cidal proteins. Platelets can interact with microbial

pathogens and play a signiﬁcant role in host defense 
against  infection  mediated  by  thrombocidins, 
released  from  platelets  by  thrombin  stimulation, 
and  chemokine-like  kinocidins,  known  to  recruit 
leukocytes to sites of infection.

As  you  can  see,  platelets  link  hemostasis  with 
inﬂammation  and  immunity  by  sensing  tissue  in-
jury  or  infection  and  releasing  antimicrobial  and 
wound-healing proteins. Note that the key activators 
of platelets are signals released from the site of injury 
or infection. 

Platelet host defense functions emphasize the value 
of  platelet  transfusion  when  confronting  infection 

and sepsis. In fact, morbidity and mortality due to 
Staphylococcus aureus correlate with inherited platelet 
disorders, including Gray platelet syndrome, and with 
thrombocytopenia (see below).  

Pathology: Platelets and coagulation disorders
About 300,000 platelets per microliter of blood circu-

patch or spot on the skin caused by bleeding. Spots 
less than 3 mm in diameter are called petechiae; spots 
larger than 1 cm in diameter are called ecchymoses.

In the blood clotting cascade, the activated form of one clotting factor 
influences the activation of the next factor. This sequence starts in 
about 15 seconds. By this amplification mechanism, small amounts of  
initial factors can activate the clotting enzymatic cascade. 
   Two pathways trigger the cascade: 
   1. The intrinsic pathway requires local damage to the endothelial 
surface of a blood vessel. 
   2. The extrinsic pathway is activated by physical trauma such as a 
puncture in the wall of a blood vessel. Both intrinsic and extrinsic 
pathways interact with each other and converge to a common 
pathway to form a fibrin clot.

Prothrombin is a protein 
produced by hepatocytes 
under the regulation of vitamin 
K. Vitamin K antagonists 
(such as dicumarol and 
warfarin) are used clinically as 
anticoagulants to prevent 
thrombosis.

Antithrombin III, a plasma 
serine protease inhibitory 
protein, inactivates thrombin 
by forming an antithrombin 
III–thrombin complex.  
   Heparin (released by mast 
cells found near blood 
vessels and basophils) has 
an anticoagulant effect by 
stabilizing antithrombin III 
clotting factors.

Widespread and symmetrical petechiae and ecchy-
moses  are  characteristic  of  the  Henoch–Schönlein 
syndrome,  an  allergic  purpura  reaction  caused  by 
drug hypersensitivity.

A reduction in the number of platelets in blood 
(thrombocytopenia) leads to increased susceptibility 
to bleeding and increased morbidity and mortality 
due to bacterial or fungal infection. 

Thrombocytopenia is deﬁned by a decrease in the 
number of platelets to less than 150,000/(cid:43)L of blood. 
Spontaneous  bleeding    is  observed  with  a  platelet 
count of 20,000/(cid:43)L. 

Thrombocytosis deﬁnes an increase in the number 

of platelets circulating in blood. 

Thrombocytopenia can be caused by:
1. A decrease in the production of platelets.
2.  An  increase  in  the  destruction  of  platelets, 
determined by antibodies against platelets or mega-
karyocyte antigens (autoimmune thrombocytopenic 
purpura, ITP), drugs, for example, penicillin, sul-
fonamides, and digoxin, and cancer chemotherapy. 
3. Aggregation of platelets in the microvasculature 
(thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,TTP), 
probably a result of pathologic changes in endothelial 
cells producing procoagulant substances. 

Deﬁciency of GP1b–factor IX complex, or of von 
Willebrand’s factor, a protein associated with factor 
VIII,  leads  to  two  congenital  bleeding  disorders, 
Bernard-Soulier  syndrome  and  von Willebrand’s 
disease, respectively (see Figures 6-11 to 6-13; see 
Box 6-D).  

These two diseases are characterized by the inability 
of giant platelets to attach to vascular subendothelial 
surfaces. 

The  GP1b–factor  IX–von Willebrand’s  factor 
complex is relevant for the aggregation and adhesion 
of normal platelets when they are exposed to injured 
subendothelial tissues. 

Gray platelet syndrome, an inherited autosomal 
recesive disease characterized by macrothrombocy-
topenia (thrombocytopenia with increased platelet 
volume),  is  due  to  a  reduction  or  absence  in  the 
content of alpha granules.  

Alpha granules store PDGF that enables platelet 
adhesiveness and wound healing when secreted dur-
ing an injury. Platelets have a gray appearance.

MYH9 (myosin heavy chain 9)-related disorders 
are also associated with macrothrombocytopenia. A 
defect in the MYH9 gene, which encodes nonmuscle 
myosin  heavy  chain  IIA  (an  isoform  expressed  in 
platelets and neutrophils). Defective MYH9 deter-
mines the premature initiation of proplatelet forma-
tion within the bone marrow, producing fewer and 
shorter proplatelets. 

We discuss later in this chapter the mechanism of 
megakaryocyte development and platelet formation.

Pathology: Hemostasis and blood clotting
The blood clotting or coagulation cascade depends 
on  the  sequential  activation  of  proenzymes  to  en-
zymes and the participation of endothelial cells and 
platelets to achieve hemostasis or arrest of bleeding.  
Hemostasis occurs when ﬁbrin is formed to reinforce 
the platelet plug (Figure 6-12).

The  blood  clotting  cascade  has  the  following 

characteristics:

1.  It  is  dependent  on  the  presence  of  inactive 
precursor proteases (for example, factor XII) that are 
converted into active enzymes (for example, factor 
XIIa) by proteolysis.

2. It is composed of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways 

(see Figure 6-13). 

3. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge 

into the common pathway.

The extrinsic pathway is triggered by damage out-
side a blood vessel and is set in motion by the release 
of tissue factor. The intrinsic pathway is stimulated 
by damage to components of the blood and blood 
vessel wall. It is induced by contact of factor XII to 
subendothelial  collagen. This  contact  results  from 
damage to the wall of a blood vessel.  

Extrinsic  and  intrinsic  pathways  converge  to  a 
crucial  step  in  which  ﬁbrinogen  is  converted  to 
ﬁbrin,  which  forms  mesh  that  enables  platelets  to 
attach.  The convergence starts with the activation 
of factor X to factor Xa, together with  activated fac-
tor Va, resulting in the cleavage of prothrombin to 
thrombin. The initial hemostatic plug consists of a 
platelet scaffold for the conversion of prothrombin 
to thrombin, which changes ﬁbrinogen into ﬁbrin 
(see Figure 6-12). 

Fibrinogen, produced by hepatocytes, consists of 
three polypeptide chains, which contain numerous 
negatively charged amino acids in the amino termi-
nal. These characteristics allow ﬁbrinogen to remain 
soluble in plasma. After cleavage, the newly formed 
fibrin  molecules  aggregate  forming  a  mesh.  We 
discuss in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System, 
the facilitating function of a ﬁbrin meshwork  to the 
migration of neutrophils during acute inﬂammation.   

Hematopoiesis
Hematopoietic niches
In  the  fetus,  hematopoiesis  (Greek  haima,  blood; 
poiein, to make) starts during the ﬁrst trimester in 
islands of hematopoiesis found in the yolk sac. The 
islands develop from hemangioblasts, the progenitors 
of both hematopoietic and endothelial cells. 

Fetal  hematopoiesis  continues  after  the  second 
trimester in the liver and then in the spleen. Dur-
ing the seventh month of intrauterine life, the bone 
marrow becomes the primary site of hematopoiesis, 
where it remains during adulthood. In the adult, an

The bone marrow can be red because of the presence of

yellow marrow may be interchangeable in relation to the demands 
for hematopoiesis. In the adult, red bone marrow is found in the 
skull, clavicles, vertebrae, ribs, sternum, pelvis, and ends of the 
long bones of the limbs. 
    Blood vessels and nerves reach the bone marrow by piercing 
the bony shell. The nutrient artery enters the midshaft of a long 
bone and branches into the central longitudinal artery, which

Bone marrow

The bone marrow consists of: (1) Hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs), multipotential cells capable of self-renewal. (2) 
Committed precursor cells (myeloid stem cell and lymphoid 
stem cell). (3) Maturing cells. Maturing cells develop from cells 
called colony-forming units (CFUs).  The myeloid stem cell 
gives rise to CFUs responsible for the regeneration of red blood 
cells (erythroid CFUs), platelets (megakaryocyte CFUs), 

basophils and mast cells (basophil CFUs), and eosinophils 
(eosinophil CFUs). Monocytes and neutrophils derive from a 
common committed progenitor cell (granulocyte-macrophage 
CFU). The lymphoid stem cell generates the B cell progeny in 
the bone marrow and T cell progenies in the thymus. They are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System.

approximate volume of 1.7 L of marrow contains 1012 
hematopoietic cells, producing about 1 x 109 RBCs 
and about 1 x 108 leukocytes every hour.

The bone marrow consists of two microenviron-

mental domains, called niches:

1. The vascular niche.
2. The endosteal niche.
Niches provide physical support, soluble factors, 
and cell-mediated interactions to regulate cell self-
renewal, differentiation and quiescence of hemato-
poietic stem cells (HSCs). 

Under  normal  conditions,  niches  enable  the 
balanced, or homeostatic, cell self-renewal and dif-
ferentiation of HSCs. Under pathologic conditions, 
such  as  myelodysplasia,  aging  or  bone  marrow 
malignancies,  niches  can  alter  or  restrain  normal 
hematopoiesis.

The vascular niche 
The  vascular  niche  consists  of  blood  vessels    sur-

rounded by a distinct population of non-hematopoi-
etic stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells,
adipose cells, endothelial cells, reticular stromal cells, 
and macrophages (Figures 6-14 to 6-16). 

The cytokines secreted by these cells can regulate 
HSCs. The perivascular space contains extracellular 
matrix  proteins,  such  as  type  IV  collagen,  ﬁbro-
nectin,  ﬁbrinogen  and  von Willebrand  factor,  that 
in  conjunction  with  cytokines,  regulate  the  HSC 
population.

The vascular niche provides a microenvironment 
for the short-term proliferation and differentiation 
of  HSCs.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  10,  Immune-
Lymphatic  System,  progenitors  of  B  cells  develop 
in  immune  cell  niches,  with  the  participation  of 
osteoblasts, CAR cells (see below), reticular stromal 
cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells.

The  bone marrow  is highly vascularized. It is sup-
plied by the central longitudinal artery, derived from 
the  nutrient  artery.  Medullary  capillary  plexuses

Figure 6-17. Erythroid lineage

Erythrocytes are the most abundant cells of the blood. They contain hemoglobin ((cid:95)2(cid:96)2 
chains in the adult) and none of the typical organelles and cytomembranes is observed 
in the cytoplasm. Erythrocytes have a lifespan of about 120 days and aged red blood 
cells are phagocytosed by macrophages in the liver and spleen.
    A lack of oxygen (hypoxia) or a decrease of erythrocytes in circulating blood (anemia; 
caused by excessive destruction of red blood cells, bleeding, iron or vitamin B12 
deficiency) stimulates interstitial cells in the renal cortex to synthesize and release into 
blood the glycoprotein erythropoietin (51 kd). Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates the 
early stages of the erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU) to proliferate and differentiate 
into basophilic, polychromatophilic, and orthochromatic erythroblasts.

The proerythroblast is the first stage 
of the red blood cell lineage that can be 
recognized. It derives from a mature 
progenitor following stimulation with 
erythropoietin.  Nucleoli are present. 
The cytoplasm contains abundant free 
polyribosomes involved in the synthesis 
of hemoglobin.  
    The synthesis of hemoglobin 
proceeds into basophilic, 
polychromatophilic, and 
orthochromatophilic erythroblasts.  
    As hemoglobin accumulates in the 
cytoplasm, the nucleus of the 
differentiating erythroblasts is reduced 
in size, chromatin condenses, and free 
ribosomes decrease. The 
orthochromatophilic erythroblast 
displays maximum chromatin 
condensation.

Proerythroblasts

Orthochromatic erythroblasts

and  periosteal capillary plexuses are interconnected. 
Medullary sinusoids drain into the central longitu-
dinal vein before leaving through the nutrient vein 
(see Figure 6-14). 

Mature hematopoietic cells translocate through the 
sinusoid wall by active transendothelial migration, 
into the sinuses (see Figure 6-15) before entering the 
circulation through the central vein. Immature he-
matopoietic cells lack the capacity of transendothelial 
migration and are retained in the extravascular space 
by the endothelial cells. 

The sinusoids of the marrow are lined by special-

ized  endothelial  cells  with  signiﬁcant  phagocytic 
activity  and  a  capacity  to  produce  growth  factors 
that  stimulate  the  proliferation  and  differentiation 
of hematopoietic cells.

Marrow reticular stromal cells produce hematopoi-
etic growth factors and  cytokines that regulate the 
production and differentiation of blood cells. 

Adipose cells provide a local source of energy as 
well as synthesize growth factors. The population of 
adipose cells increases with age and obesity and fol-
lowing chemotherapy. Adipose cells exert a negative 
regulatory effect on HSCs function.

1
         Erythropoietin (EPO), produced by interstitial 
cells in the renal cortex, is transported to the bone 
marrow by the blood circulation.

2
         In the bone marrow, EPO binds to the dimerized 
erythropoietin receptor, present in early stages of the 
erythroid CFU progeny, and induces binding of 
cytosolic STAT 5 (signal transducers and activators of 
transcription 5) protein to JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a 
tyrosine kinase bound to the intracellular domain of the 
receptor.

3
         The inactive (nonphosphorylated) form of STAT 5 
contains an SH2 (Src homology 2) domain. STAT 5 is 
recruited by JAK2 and binds to it through the SH2 
domain. STAT 5 becomes phosphorylated and 
homodimerizes.

         The phosphorylated STAT 5 homodimer 
4
translocates into the nucleus.

5
         After binding to DNA, the phosphorylated STAT 5 
homodimer activates the transcription of specific genes 
required for erythropoiesis.

Marrow macrophages remove apoptotic cells, re-
sidual nuclei from orthochromatic erythroblasts and 
megakaryocytes, and exclude particles from entering 
the marrow. 

The endosteal niche

The endosteal niche, located at the endosteum–
bone  marrow  interface,  consists  of  preosteoblasts 
(osteoprogenitor  cells),  osteoblasts  and  osteoclasts 
interacting with HSCs. Type I collagen is the most 
abundant extracellular component of the endosteal 
niche. 

The endosteal niche is regarded as a site for long-

term storage of quiescent HSCs. 

Osteoblasts  produce    multiple  hematopoietic 
cytokines,  including  G-CSF  (granulocyte-colony 
stimulating  factor),  M-CSF  (macrophage-colony 
stimulating  factor},  GM-CSF  (granulocyte-macro-
phage-colony  stimulating  factor),  IL-1,  IL-6,  and 
IL-7. Osteoblasts produce CXC-chemokine ligand 
12  (CXCL12)  with  binding  affinity  to  CXCR4 
(for  chemokine  receptor  type  4).  Perivascular  re-
ticular stromal cells, called CAR cells (for CXCL12-
abundant cells) are a major source of CXCL12. The  
CXCL12-CXCR4  complex  is  a  regulator  of  the 

migration and localization of HSCs in bone marrow.  
CAR  cells,  a  subpopulation  of  mesenchymal  stem 
cells, are closely associated with HSCs.

Osteoblasts also express angiopoietin-1, a positive 
regulator  of  HSCs,  and  thrombopoietin  (also  syn-
thesized in liver and kidney) and osteopontin, that 
promote HSCs quiescence by stimulating osteoblasts 
to produce integrins and cadherins to enhance attach-
ment of HSCs to the endosteal surface.

Hematopoietic cell populations 
The  bone marrow consists of three major populations 
(see Figure 6-16): 

1. HSCs, capable of self-renewal.
2. Committed precursor cells, responsible for the 

generation of distinct cell lineages.

3. Maturing cells, resulting from the differentiation 

of the committed precursor cell population.  

HSCs  can  self-renew  and  produce  two  commit-
ted  precursor  cells  that develop into distinct cell 
progenies: 

1. The myeloid stem cell.
2. The lymphoid stem cell.
Self-renewal is an important property of HSCs. 
Self-renewal preserves the pool of stem cells and is

    Basophilic erythroblasts derive from the proerythroblast.

These cells may range in diameter from 9 to 15 (cid:43)m. The nucleus exhibits dense 
chromatin patches separated by lighter areas. No nucleolus is visible. The 
cytoplasm may contain clumps of polyribosomes (light-blue staining)  involved in the 
synthesis of hemoglobin (light pink-to-gray staining). 
   No cell division takes place after the polychromatophilic erythroblast.

  Orthochromatic erythroblast
 
This cell is approximately 8 to 10 (cid:43)m in diameter. The cytoplasm is pink, much the 
same as the reticulocyte. These cells have an extremely dense (pyknotic), 
eccentrically located nucleus. Orthochromatic erythroblasts are postmitotic. 
   The transition to reticulocyte is preceded by the extrusion of the condensed nucleus 
that carries with it a rim of cytoplasm. The extruded nucleus is engulfed by a 
macrophage.

  Reticulocyte

These anucleated cells measure approximately 7 to 8 (cid:43)m in diameter. The 
cytoplasm is pink like the orthochromatic erythroblast. In regular preparations, 
these cells appear identical to mature erythrocytes. With supravital stains, such 
as methylene blue or cresyl blue, a filamentous (reticular) network of 
polyribosomes becomes visible. 
   Reticulocytes remain in the bone marrow for 1 or 2 days and then are released 
into the peripheral blood. Following 1 day of circulation, reticulocytes mature into 
erythrocytes.

critical for feeding common myeloid progenitor and 
common lymphoid progenitor into the differentia-
tion or maturation pathway.

HSCs  are  difﬁcult  to  identify,  mainly  because 
they represent approximately 0.05% of total hema-
topoietic cells (about 106 to 107 stem cells). In bone 
marrow  transplantation,  only  5%  of  the  normal 
hematopoietic  stem  cells  are  needed  to  repopulate 
the entire bone marrow. 

HSCs cannot be identiﬁed by morphology; they 
can be recognized  by speciﬁc cell surface markers 
(c-kit  receptor  and Thy-1).  Instead,  CD34+  com-
mitted  precursor  cell  populations,  also  containing 
CD34–  HSCs, are generally used for transplantation 
in the clinical treatment of malignant diseases with 
chemotherapeutic agents that deplete a certain group 

of committed precursor cells. 

 Myeloid and lymphoid stem cells are multipoten-
tial cells (see Figure 6-16). They are committed to the 
formation of cells of the blood and lymphoid organs.
Five colony-forming units (CFUs) derive from the 

myeloid stem cell: 

1. The erythroid CFU, that produces red blood 

cells.

2. The megakaryocyte CFU, that generates plate-

lets.

3. The granulocyte-macrophage CFU, that pro-

duces monocytes and neutrophils.  

4. The eosinophil CFU.
5. The basophil CFU, that in addition to baso-
phils, produces non-granulated mast cell precursors 
that  become  granulated  mast  cells  when  recruited

The lymphoid stem cell derives from the hema-
topoietic stem cell and gives rise to T cell and B cell 
precursors. We study the development and matura-
tion of T cells and B cells in Chapter 10, Immune-
Lymphatic System.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hematopoietic growth factors
Hematopoietic growth factors control the prolifera-
tive  and  maturational  phases  of  hematopoiesis.  In 
addition, they can extend the life span and function 
of a number of cells produced in the bone marrow. 
Several recombinant forms are available for clinical 
treatment of blood disorders. 

Hematopoietic growth factors, also known as he-
matopoietic cytokines, are glycoproteins produced 
in  the  bone  marrow  by  endothelial  cells,  stromal 
cells, ﬁbroblasts, developing lymphocytes, and mac-
rophages.  Hematopoietic  growth  factors  are  also 
produced outside the bone marrow.

There  are  three  major  groups  of  hematopoietic 

growth factors: 

1. Colony-stimulating factors.

2. Erythropoietin (Figure 6-17) and  thrombopoi-

etin (Greek thrombos, clot; poietin, to make).

3. Cytokines (primarily interleukins).
Colony-stimulating factors are so named because 
they are able to stimulate committed precursor cells to 
grow in vitro into cell clusters or colonies. Interleukins 
are  produced  by  leukocytes  (mainly  lymphocytes) 
and  affect  other  leukocytes  (paracrine  mechanism) 
or themselves (autocrine mechanism).

Hematopoietic  cells  express  distinct  patterns  of 
growth factor receptors as they differentiate. Binding 
of the ligand to the receptor leads to a conformational 
change,  activation  of  intracellular  kinases,  and  the 
ﬁnal induction of cell proliferation (see Chapter 3, 
Cell Signaling).

We  discuss  the  roles  of  speciﬁc  hematopoietic 

growth factors when we analyze each cell lineage.
 
Erythroid lineage 
Erythropoiesis includes the following sequence (see 
Figure  6-17):  proerythroblast,  basophilic  erythro-
blast, polychromatophilic erythroblast, orthochro-
matic erythroblast, reticulocyte, and erythrocyte.

   Myeloblast

Throughout the granulocytic differentiation process (the neutrophilic series is 
shown), major changes occur in the structure of the nucleus and the content 
of the cytoplasm. For example, in the myeloblast (10 to 20 (cid:43)m; a cell usually 
difficult to identify in Wright-stained preparations), the nucleus is round with 
uncondensed chromatin and a visible nucleolus. As the cell progresses 
through the subsequent stages of differentiation, the nucleus becomes 
indented, then segmented, and the chromatin increases its condensation. 
The cytoplasm of the myeloblast is essentially granule-free. Primary 
granules appear in the promyelocyte stage, while specific or secondary 
granules are synthesized by myelocytes.

Nucleoli and  
primary granules 
are present

granules are seen

  Promyelocyte
This cell measures approximately 15 to 20 (cid:43)m in diameter. It has a large, 
round nucleus with uncondensed chromatin and one or more oval nucleoli. 
The synthesis of primary granules, stained red or magenta, occurs 
exclusively at this stage. The cytoplasm is basophilic due to the presence 
of abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum. Promyelocytes give rise to 
neutrophilic, eosinophilic, or basophilic myelocytes. It is not possible in 
conventional preparations to determine which type of granulocyte will be 
produced by a given promyelocyte.

Myelocyte
This cell, measuring 12 to 18 (cid:43)m, has a round or oval nucleus that may be 
slightly indented; nucleoli are not present. The basophilic cytoplasm 
contains primary granules produced in the promyelocyte stage as 
well as some specific granules, whose synthesis is detected in the 
myelocyte. Consequently, the myelocyte cytoplasm begins to resemble 
that of the mature basophil, eosinophil, or neutrophil. The myelocyte is 
the last stage capable of mitosis. Myelocytes produce a large number of 
specific granules, but a finite number of primary granules (produced in the 
promyelocyte) are distributed among daughter myelocytes.  

  Metamyelocyte
This postmitotic cell measures 10 to 15 (cid:43)m in diameter. The eccentric, bean- 
shaped nucleus now contains some condensed chromatin. The cytoplasm 
closely resembles that of the mature form.  The specific granules outnumber 
the primary granules.

A distinctive feature of promyelocytes is the primary 
granules (azurophilic in the neutrophilic lineage).  
Several nucleolar masses can be seen within an 
eccentric or central nucleus. 

Promyelocyte

As promyelocytes advance in their development, primary granules become 
more abundant. Promyelocytes have a diameter of 15 to 20 (cid:43)m, contrasting 
with the much smaller band form cell (9 to 15 (cid:43)m) and polychromatophilic 
erythroblasts (12 to 15 (cid:43)m) present in the field.  A nucleolus is still visible.

Cytoplasmic granules

Basophils display large cytoplasmic granules 
containing substances that are released to mediate 
allergic and inflammatory reactions, in particular to affect 
vascular permeability. 
   An increase in basophils is seen in myeloproliferative 
disorders. An acute nonlymphocytic leukemia with 
basophil-like cells is associated with symptoms caused 
by the release of histamine.

Band form basophil

etin (EPO) (Figure 6-18), a glycoprotein produced 
primarily (90%) in the kidneys (juxtatubular inter-
stitial cells in the renal cortex) in response to hypoxia 
(a decrease in oxygen level in inspired air or tissues).   
Renal juxtatubular interstitial cells sense oxygen 
levels through oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase, 
a protein that hydroxylates the transcription factor 
hypoxia-inducible factor 1(cid:95) (HIF-1(cid:95)) to repress the 
activity of the erythropoietin gene. Under conditions 
of low oxygen tension, the hydroxylase is inactive 
and nonhydroxylated HIF-1(cid:95) can drive the produc-
tion of erythropoietin. 

Erythropoietin  stimulates  the  proliferation  of 
erythroid progenitor cells by decreasing the levels of 
cell cycle inhibitors and increasing cyclins and the 
antiapoptotic  protein  BclxL.  Erythropoietin  is  also 
produced  by  neurons  and  glial  cells  in  the  central 
nervous system and in the retina. The administration 
of erythropoietin exerts a protective effect on neurons 
after ischemia (stroke).

Erythropoietin synthesis in chronic renal diseases 
is severely impaired. Recombinant erythropoietin can 
be administered intravenously or subcutaneously for 
the treatment of anemia caused by a decrease in the 
production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.

The  effectiveness  of  erythropoietin  treatment 

can be monitored by an increase of reticulocytes in 
circulating blood. Reticulocytes can be identiﬁed by 
the supravital stain of residual polyribosomes forming 
a reticular network (Figure 6-19).

Note in Figure 6-17 that polychromatophilic eryth-
roblasts are erythropoietin-independent, mitotically 
active, and speciﬁcally involved in the synthesis of 
hemoglobin. Derived orthochromatic erythroblasts, 
reticulocytes, and mature RBCs are postmitotic cells 
(not involved in mitosis).

Leukopoiesis 
Leukopoiesis (Greek leukos, white; poietin, to make) 
results  in  the  formation  of  cells  belonging  to  the 
granulocyte and agranulocyte series. 

In the current branching lineage tree model of he-
matopoiesis (see Figure 6-16), the myeloid stem cell 
generates  the  granulocytic  neutrophil,  eosinophil  
and basophil progenies, in addition to megakaryocyte 
and erythroid progenies.

The  granulocyte  lineage  (Figure  6-20)  includes 
the  myeloblast,  promyelocyte,  myelocyte,  meta-
myelocyte, band cell, and mature form. In the bi-
nary lineage tree model, the granulocyte-macrophage 
precursor gives rise to neutrophils and monocytes. 
Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes.

into tissues where they differentiate into a variety of tissue-specific 
macrophages.

Granulocytes  
Neutrophil  and  macrophage  cell  lines  share  a 
common  precursor  cell  lineage:  the  granulocyte-
macrophage CFU (see Figure 6-20). 

Eosinophils and basophils derive from indepen-
dent  eosinophil  and  basophil  CFUs.  Neutrophil, 
eosinophil, and basophil granulocytes follow a similar 
pattern of proliferation, differentiation, maturation, 
and  storage  in  the  bone  marrow.  Details  of  these 
processes are better recognized for neutrophils, the 
most  abundant  granulocyte  in  the  bone  marrow 
and blood. It takes 10 to 14 days for neutrophils to 
develop from early precursors, but this timing is ac-
celerated in the presence of infections or by treatment 
with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or 
granulocyte-macrophage CSF (see below).

Myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes are 
mitotically dividing cells; metamyelocytes and band 
cells cannot divide but continue to differentiate (see 
Figure 6-20). 

A typical feature of the maturation of granulocytes 
are the cytoplasmic primary (azurophilic) and sec-
ondary (speciﬁc) granules (Figures 6-21 and 6-22). 
Myeloblasts  are  undifferentiated  cells  lacking 
cytoplasmic granules. Promyelocytes and myelocytes 
display primary granules in cells of the neutrophil, 
eosinophil,  and  basophil  series.  Primary  granules 
persist  as  such  throughout  the  cell  differentiation 
sequence (see Figure 6-22). Secondary granules ap-
pear in myelocytes. 

Eosinophils exhibit the same maturation sequence 

as neutrophils. Eosinophil-speciﬁc granules are larger 
than neutrophil granules and appear refractile under 
the light microscope. Eosinophilic granules contain 
eosinophil  peroxidase  (with  antibacterial  activity) 
and several cationic proteins (major basic protein, 
and eosinophil cationic protein, with antiparasitic 
activity). See Figure 6-5 for a listing of proteins as-
sociated with eosinophils.

The basophil CFU produces basophils and mast 
cell precursors, a lineage speciﬁcation that is regu-
lated by the expression of the transcription factors 
GATA-binding  protein  2  (GATA2)  and  CCAAT/
enhancer-binding protein-(cid:95) (C/EBP(cid:95)). Deletion of
C/EBP(cid:95)  favors  mast  cell  development,  whereas 
its overexpression  induces the development of the 
basophil  lineage.  In  addition,  signalling  mediated 
by  STAT5  (for  signal  transducer  and  activator  of 
transcription 5) is essential for the development of 
basophil precursors in bone marrow. 

Basophils are distinguished by their large, coarse, 
and metachromatic granules that ﬁll the cytoplasm 
and  often  obscure  the  nucleus  (Figure  6-23).  Like 
neutrophils and eosinophils, basophils complete their 
maturation in bone marrow. The  granules contain 
peroxidase, heparin, and histamine as well as kalli-
krein, a substance that attracts eosinophils. See Figure 
6-6 for additional structural and functional features 
of basophils.

Mast  cells  leave  the  bone  marrow  as  immature 
precursor cells rather than granule-containing mature 
cells like basophils. Mast cells are found close to blood

Megakaryocyte

The development and maturation of a megakaryocyte (in about 5 
days) are characterized by the following sequence:
1. Serial mitotic divisions (reaching a DNA content up to 128n) 
without cell division, a process known as endoreduplication. As a 
result, a tightly packed, multilobed nucleus is observed.
2. Cytoplasmic maturation, characterized by an increase in the 
number of dense core granules, alpha(cid:3)granules, and a network of 
membrane channels and tubules known as the Invaginated membrane 
system.
3. Proplatelet shedding into sinusoids of the bone marrow.

   During the cytoplasmic maturation of a megakaryocyte, 
the cell membrane invaginates to form channels separating 
cytoplasmic islands about 3 to 4 (cid:43)m in diameter.  
   These platelet demarcation channels eventually coalesce 
to generate proplatelets.  Megakaryocytes typically rest 
next to bone marrow sinusoids (vascular niche) and extend 
10 to 20 proplatelet projections at one time between 
endothelial cells into the sinusoids where they are shed. 
S1P, bound to the S1pr1 receptor, mediates the 
extension and shedding of proplatelets.

mast  cells:  connective  tissue  mast  cells  (CTMCs; 
located around blood vessels) and T-cell dependent 
mucosal mast cells (MMCs; in the intestinal villi and 
respiratory mucosa). CTMCs and MMCs contain 
subsets of metachromatic granules speciﬁcally syn-
thesized during their maturation in local tissues and 
released upon host response to pathogens. 

It is important to stress once more that basophils 
and mast cells are associated with type 2 immunity, 
that  develops  in  the  presence  of TH2  cells,  high 
levels  of  immunoglobulin  E  and  eosinophilia  and 
in response to allergens and multicellular parasites 
(helminths).

 

Agranulocytes: Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes constitute a heterogeneous population 
of cells that differ from each other in terms of ori-
gin, life span, preferred sites of localization within 
lymphoid organs, cell surface markers and function.
HSCs gives rise to all hematopoietic cells, includ-
ing lymphocytes of the B and T cell lineage. B cells 
mature in the bone marrow and then migrate to 
other lymphoid organs. T cells complete their matu-
ration in the thymus and then migrate to speciﬁc 
lymphoid organs. 

A  lymphoblast  gives  rise  to  a  prolymphocyte, 
an  intermediate  stage  that  precedes  the  mature 
lymphocyte. B and T lymphocytes are nonphago-
cytic  cells.  They  are  morphologically  similar  but 
functionally different, as discussed in Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System.

Lymphoblasts (8 to 12 (cid:43)m in diameter) are the 
precursors  of  the  lymphocytes.  A  lymphoblast  has 
an  uncondensed  nucleus  with  a  large  nucleolus. 
The  cytoplasm  contains  many  polyribosomes  and 
a  few  cisternae  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (see 
Figure 6-7).

Lymphocytes (8 (cid:43)m in diameter or less) contain a 
round or slightly indented condensed nucleus. The 
nucleolus is not visible. The cytoplasm is moderately 
basophilic and generally devoid of granules.

Monocytes
Monocytes derive from the granulocyte-macrophage 
CFU. We have already discussed that the granulocyte-
macrophage CFU gives rise to the neutrophil lineage 
and the macrophage lineage. 

Under the inﬂuence of a speciﬁc CSF, each precur-
sor cell establishes its own hierarchy: the granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) takes the granulo-
cyte precursor cell into the myeloblast pathway;  the 
granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor 
(GM-CSF) guides the monocyte precursor cell into 
the monoblast pathway, leading to the production of 
peripheral blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. 
Receptors  for  the  macrophage-stimulating  factor 

(M-CSF) are restricted to the monocyte lineage (see 
Osteoclastogenesis in Chapter 5, Osteogenesis). 

Monoblasts (14 (cid:43)m in diameter) are morphologi-
cally similar to myeloblasts. The monoblast is present 
in the bone marrow and is difﬁcult to identify with 
certainty. The cytoplasm is basophilic and the nucleus 
is large and displays one or more nucleoli. The fol-
lowing cell in the series is the promonocyte.

Promonocytes (11 to 13 (cid:43)m in diameter) contain 
a large nucleus with a slight indentation and uncon-
densed  chromatin.  A  nucleolus  may  be  visualized. 
The basophilic cytoplasm, due to polyribosomes, con-
tains primary granules (lysosomes with peroxidase, 
arylsulfatase,  and  acid  phosphatase). The  primary 
granules are smaller and fewer than in promyelocytes. 
Both monoblasts and promonocytes are mitotically 
active cells.

Monocytes (12 to 20 (cid:43)m in diameter) in the bone 
marrow and the blood have a large indented nucleus 
found in the central portion of the cytoplasm (Figure 
6-24; see Figure 6-8). Granules (primary lysosomes) 
and  small  vacuoles  are  typical  features.  Lysosomes 
contain  proteases  and  hydrolases.  Monocytes  are 
motile in response to chemotactic signals and attach 
to microorganisms, a function facilitated by special 
receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G 
and for complement proteins coating the microorgan-
ism. Monocytes are active phagocytes. 

Macrophages (15 to 80 (cid:43)m in diameter) constitute 
a population of blood monocytes. After circulating 
for  20  to  40  hours,  monocytes  leave  the  blood  to 
enter  the  tissues  (lungs,  spleen,  liver,  lymph  node, 
peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract and bone [osteo-
clasts]), where they become macrophages in response 
to local conditions. 

The  structural  and  functional  characteristics  of 
tissue macrophages are discussed in Chapter 4, Con-
nective Tissue. In Chapter 11, Integumentary System, 
we  discuss  the  antigenic  reactivity  of  monocyte-
derived Langerhans cells in epidermis. In Chapter 
17, Digestive Glands, we explore the important role 
of Kupffer cells in liver function, and in Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System, we examine the phago-
cytic properties of macrophages in spleen.

Pathology: Colony-stimulating factors and 
interleukins
G-CSF  is  a  glycoprotein  produced  by  endothelial 
cells, ﬁbroblasts, and macrophages in different parts 
of the body. The synthetic form of G-CSF (known 
as ﬁlgrastim or lenograstim) causes a dose-dependent 
increase of neutrophils in the blood. G-CSF is used 
for  the  treatment  of  neutropenia  (neutrophil  + 
Greek penia, poverty; small numbers of neutrophils 
in  circulating  blood)  after  cancer  chemotherapy, 
after  bone  marrow  transplantation,  to  facilitate  an

Imatinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine 
kinases with remarkable effects in 
the treatment of chronic myeloid 
leukemia.

protein substrate will be 
phosphorylated on tyrosine and 
initiate a downstream signaling

increase  of  neutrophils,  and  in  the  treatment  of 
chronic neutropenia.

GM-CSF is also a glycoprotein produced by endo-
thelial cells, T cells, ﬁbroblasts, and monocytes that 
stimulates the formation of neutrophils, eosinophils, 
basophils,  monocytes,  and  dendritic  cells  (Figure 
6-25).  However,  GM-CSF  is  less  potent  than  G-
CSF in increasing the levels of neutrophils during 
neutropenia. As is the case with G-CSF, a synthetic 
form of GM-CSF (sargramostim or molgramostim) 
is available for the treatment of neutropenia.

Interleukins have a relevant function in the forma-
tion and function of type B and T cells as we discuss 
in  Chapter  10,  Immune-Lymphatic  System.  IL-3 
stimulates proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells 
and acts together with other growth factors, including 
stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, IL-1, IL-6, and Flt3 
(fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) ligand (see Figure 6-25). 
IL-5 acts speciﬁcally on the eosinophil progeny.

Megakaryocytes and platelets
The precursor cell of the platelet (also called throm-
bocyte; Greek thrombos, clot) is the megakaryoblast, 

a  cell  derived  from  the  megakaryocyte  CFU  (see 
Figure 6-16).

The megakaryoblast (15 to 50  (cid:43)m in diameter) 
displays a single kidney-shaped nucleus with several 
nucleoli. The megakaryoblast enlarges to give rise to 
the promegakaryocyte (20 to 80  (cid:43)m in diameter) 
with an irregularly shaped nucleus and a cytoplasm 
rich in azurophilic granules. The promegakaryocyte 
forms the mature megakaryocyte located in the vas-
cular niche, adjacent to a sinusoid.

The megakaryocyte (50 to 100 (cid:43)m in diameter; 
Figure  6-26)  contains  an  irregularly  multilobed 
nucleus  produced  by  an  endomitotic  nuclear  di-
vision  process  in  which  DNA  replication  occurs 
without cell division (polyploid nucleus). The DNA 
content  of multilobed nucleus can reach a value of 
128n before completing cell maturation in about 5 
days and start the formation of platelets. Nucleoli 
are not detected. 

The megakaryocyte can be mistaken for the osteo-
clast, another large cell in bone that is multinucleated 
instead of multilobed. 

The cytoplasm shows a network of demarcation

209

zones  formed  by  the  invagination  of  the  plasma 
membrane of the megakaryocyte. The coalescence of 
the demarcation membranes results in the formation 
of  proplatelets released directly into the marrow 
sinusoidal  space  where  they    fragment  into  pre-
platelets and then into platelets. The formation and 
release of proplatelet extensions is mediated by S1P 
(for sphingosine 1 phosphate) bound to its receptor 
S1pr1. S1P signaling in the vascular space directly 
stimulates the release of new platelets.

The  entire  cytoplasm  of  the  megakaryocyte  is 
gradually  converted  into  proplatelets  and  its  mul-
tilobed  nucleus  is  extruded  and  phagocytosed  by 
macrophages (see Figure 6-26).

    Platelets  play  important  roles  in  maintaining 
the integrity of blood vessels. Recall  the sequential 
steps of hemostasis following platelet activation (see 
Figure 6-12). 

Finally,  megakaryocytes  produce  and  secrete  in 
the  bone  marrow  chemokine  C-X-C  motif  ligand 
4  (CXCL4)  and  transforming  growth  factor-(cid:96)1 
(TGF(cid:96)1) that regulate the cell cycle activity of HSC.  
CXCL4 and TGF(cid:96)1 increase the number of quies-
cent  HSCs  during  homeostasis  and  their  decrease 
stimulates the proliferation of quiescent HSCs. Note 
that the differentiated megakaryocytes, derived from 
HSCs, can regulate the pool size of their progenitors. 
 
Clinical signiﬁcance: Thrombopoietin
Thrombopoietin is produced in the liver, has a similar 
structure to erythropoietin, and stimulates the devel-
opment of megakaryocytes from the megakaryocyte 
CFU into platelets. Deﬁciencies in thrombopoietin 
cause thrombocytopenia. An excess of thrombopoi-
etin causes thrombocytosis.

Platelets bind and degrade thrombopoietin, a pro-

cess that autoregulates platelet production. 

Pathology:  Stem  cell  factor  (also  known  as  c-kit 
ligand)
Stem cell factor (SCF) is a ligand protein produced 
by  fetal  tissues  and  reticular  stromal  cells  of  the 
bone marrow. SCF exists in two forms: membrane-
associated and soluble forms, the latter generated by 
proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-associated pro-
tein. SCF binds to c-kit receptor, a tyrosine kinase. 
The  c-kit  receptor  has  an  extracellular  domain 
consisting of ﬁve immunoglobulin motif repeats re-
sponsible for SCF binding and dimerization (Figure 
6-27).  Binding of SCF induces the dimerization of 
the c-kit receptor, followed by autophosphorylation. 
Autophosphorylated c-kit receptor is the docking site 
of speciﬁc signaling molecules.

The  intracellular  domain  has  an  adenosine  tri-
phosphate  (ATP)  binding  site  and  a  catalytic  site. 
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib binds to the 

ATP binding site and prevents the phosphorylation 
of substrates involved in the activation of downstream 
signaling. Imatinib shows remarkable results in the 
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.

SCF by itself is a weak stimulator of hematopoi-
esis but makes HSCs responsive to other cytokines 
(see Figure 6-25). It does not induce the formation 
of cell colonies by itself.  Flt3 (for fms-like tyrosine 
kinase 3) ligand is closely related to c-kit receptor and 
SCF. Similar to SCF, Flt3 ligand acts on the HSC in 
synergy with thrombopoietin, SCF, and interleukins.
The c-kit receptor is expressed by the c-kit proto-
oncogene. Mutations in genes expressing c-kit recep-
tor and/or SCF  cause:

1. Anemia.
2.  Defective development of melanocytes in skin.
3.  Reduced  migration,  survival  and  prolifera-
tion of primordial germinal cells in the developing 
ovaries and testes (see Chapter 21, Sperm Transport 
and Maturation).

4. Arrest in the development of mast cells.
SCF  is  potentially  useful  for  the  treatment  of 
inherited and acquired disorders of hematopoiesis as 
well as in bone marrow transplantation. 

Pathology: Iron-overload disorders
In  addition  to  erythropoietin,  the  formation  of 
RBCs is highly dependent on  iron metabolism and 
the  water-soluble  vitamins  folic  acid  (folacin)  and 
vitamin B12 (cobalamin). 

Iron is involved in the transport of oxygen and car-
bon dioxide. Several iron-binding proteins store and 
transport iron, for example, hemoglobin in RBCs, 
myoglobin in muscle tissue, cytochromes and various 
nonheme enzymes.  

Approximately  65–75%  of  iron  is  found  in  the 
hemoglobin of RBCs in the form of heme. Heme 
is a molecule synthesized in the bone marrow, with 
one ferrous ion, Fe(II), bound to a tetrapyrrolic ring, 
and hematin, with one ferric ion, Fe(III), bound to 
a protein. The liver stores about 10–20% of iron in 
the form of ferritin.

Systemic iron levels are controlled by:
1. Absorption. Iron is absorbed in the duodenum.
2. Recycling. Iron recycling of senescent erythro-
cytes by spleen and liver macrophages is the primary 
body’s iron supply.

3. Mobilization of iron stores in the liver.
Mammals  do  not  have  a  regulated  pathway  of 
iron excretion. Instead, this process is controlled by 
hepcidin, an iron regulatory protein.  

In blood plasma, iron is bound to transferrin (Tf). 
Tf delivers iron to cells by binding to their Tf recep-
tors. When there is a defect in Tf or an over-saturation 
of Tf binding capacity, iron in plasma accumulates in 
the cytoplasm of parenchymal tissues.

     6. BLOOD AND HEMATOPOIESIS

Iron-overload disorders

Hemochromatosis 

Hepcidin, a member of the family of defensins 
secreted by hepatocytes, regulates the entry of iron 
into blood plasma. 
   Hepcidin is encoded by the human gene HAMP. 
Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and triggers its 
internalization and lysosomal degradation. 
Removal of ferroportin from the plasma membrane 
prevents iron export, leading to increasing levels 
of iron in the cytoplasm, stored in ferritin. This 
negative regulatory mechanism can be modulated 
during anemia, hypoxia and inflammation.
   Iron-overload diseases occur when the amount of 
iron in plasma exceeds the binding capacity of Tf. 
Parenchymal tissues, such as liver, take up iron by a 
Tf-independent mechanism. 
    Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an 
iron-overload disease caused by a genetic defect in  
three genes resulting in the abnormal expression of 
hepcidin (HH type 1 [the most common; characterized 
by liver cirrhosis, fibrosis and diabetes]; HH type 2 
[mutation of the Tf receptor gene and decreased 
expression of hepcidin] and HH type 3 [juvenil 
hemochromatosis; endocrine and cardiac 
dysfunction]). HH type 4 is caused by a defective gene 
encoding ferroportin. Hemosiderosis is an acquired 
iron-overload disease.

 Box 6-E  | Anemia

•  Anemia is a reduction in the mass of circulating red blood cells. It is detected 
by analysis of peripheral blood (low hemoglobin, low red blood cell count, and 
low hematocrit).  Anemia results in the lack of oxygen-carrying capacity, which 
is compensated for by a reduction in the afﬁnity of hemoglobin for oxygen, 
an increase in cardiac output, and an attempt to increase red blood cell 
production. The most common cause of anemia is iron deﬁciency (low intake, 
chronic blood loss, or increased demand during pregnancy and lactation). 
•  Deﬁciency in vitamin B12 and folic acid causes megaloblastic anemia 
(Figure 6-29). This  form of anemia is associated with the development of 
abnormally large red blood cell precursors (megaloblasts) that develop into 
large red blood cells (macrocytes). Vitamin B12 is normally absorbed in the 
small intestine after binding to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by 
gastric parietal cells. The lack of production of intrinsic factor (due to autoim-
mune atrophic gastritis, or after surgical gastrectomy) results in pernicious 
anemia.

Tf, produced in the liver, and lactoferrin, present 
in maternal milk, are nonheme proteins involved in 
the transport of iron (Figure 6-28). Tf complexed to 
two Fe(III) ions is called ferrotransferrin. Tf devoid 
of iron is known as apotransferrin.

The Tf receptor is a transmembrane dimer with 
each subunit binding to Fe(III). The internalization 
of the Tf-Fe(III) complex is dependent on Tf receptor 
phosphorylation triggered by Ca2+-calmodulin and 
the protein kinase C complex.  

Inside the cell, Fe(III) is released within the acidic 
endosomal compartment and is converted to Fe(II) by 
the endosomal ferrireductase STEAP3. Fe(II) is then 
transported out of the endosome into the cytosol by 
DMT1 (for divalent metal transporter-1) and either 
stored in ferritin or incorporated into hemoglobin 
in RBCs. 

The Tf  receptor  is  recycled  back  to  the  plasma 

membrane. 

Ferritin is a major protein synthesized in the liver. 
A single ferritin molecule has the capacity to store 
up to 4500 iron ions. When the storage capacity of 
ferritin is exceeded, iron is deposited as hemosiderin. 
Ferritin with little iron is called apoferritin. 

Fe(II) is exported from the ferritin cell storage by 
the iron exporter ferroportin. The function of fer-
roportin is tightly controlled by hepcidin depending 
on the body’s iron levels. Exported Fe(II) is converted 
to Fe(III) by the membrane associated ferroxidase, 
hephaestin,  and  then  enters  blood  circulation  (see 
Figure 8-26).

Hepcidin is a negative regulator of iron transport 
encoded by the human HAMP gene. Hepcidin regu-
lates iron homeostasis by down regulating ferroportin, 
the iron exporter. As a negative regulator, hepcidin 
major functions are:

1. To sequester iron in tissues.
2. To lower serum iron levels.
3. To reduce iron absorption from the diet.
Upon hepcidin binding to ferroportin, ferropor-
tin  is  internalized  and  degraded  in  lysosomes  (see 
Figure 6-28).  Hepcidin-induced internalization of 
ferroportin determines a decreased iron efﬂux into 
circulation from duodenal enterocytes, macrophages, 
and hepatocytes. 

Hepcidin expression increases when body iron is 

abundant and is decreased in iron deﬁciency.

Under  physiologic  conditions,  the  expression  of 

hepatic hepcidin is regulated by several proteins: 

1. The hereditary hemochromatosis protein, called 

HFE (for high iron [Fe]).

Iron-overload diseases

2. Tf receptor.
3.  Hemojuvelin (HJV).
4. Bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6).
5. Matriptase-2.
6. Neogenin.
7. Tf. 
Defective  expression  of  hepcidin  will  take  place 
when any one of these proteins, in particular HVJ, 
is missing.

Under hypoxic conditions, the  transcription fac-
tor  hypoxia-inducible  factor  1(cid:95)  (HIF-1(cid:95))  binds 
to the promoter of the HAMP gene and blocks the 
expression  of  hepcidin.   We  discussed  early  on  in 
this chapter the activity of the erythropoietin gene 
as  an  inducer  of  RBC  production.  We  made  the 
point that, under conditions of low oxygen tension, 
the transcription factor HIF-1(cid:95)(cid:3)becomes active to 
enhance the production of erythropoietin. 

As you can see, the activity of HIF-1(cid:95) is neces-
sary for providing two of the critical elements for 
erythropoiesis: erythropoietin, and iron.

Iron-overload diseases, such as hereditary hemo-
chromatosis (HH), can occur when misregulation of 
HAMP gene expression takes place. Massive deposits 
of iron in hepatocytes are very harmful, leading to 
cirrhosis and liver ﬁbrosis (see Figure 6-28).  

HH has been attributed to defects in four genes:
1. HH type 1, the most common iron-overload 
disorder,  is  characterized  by  increased  absorption 
and deposition of iron in the liver, heart, pancreas 
and skin. Cirrhosis, diabetes and heart arrhythmias 
occur over time. Mutations in the HFE gene create a 
defective hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, 
that affects the interaction of Tf with the Tf receptor, 
thereby hampering the regulation of iron absorption.
2. HH type 2, also called juvenile hemochroma-
tosis, is deﬁned by signiﬁcant heart and endocrine 
dysfunction, instead of liver disease. It is prevalent 
in the ﬁrst and second decade of life. 

HH  type  2  is  determined  by  mutations  in  the 
HAMP gene, encoding  hepcidin, or in the HFE2 
gene,  encoding  HJV,  a  glycophosphatidylinositol 
(GPI)-linked  membrane  protein.  Juvenile  hemo-
chromatosis  patients  with  HJV  mutations  have  a 
signiﬁcant suppression of hepatic hepcidin expres-
sion,  resulting  in  a  severe  iron  accumulation  in 
speciﬁc organs.

3.  HH  type  3,  is  caused  by  a  mutation  in  the 
TFR2 gene, encoding Tf receptor 2. The expression 
of hepcidin is affected by this mutation.

4. HH type 4, is also called ferroportin disease and 
affects macrophages. Mutated ferrroportin fails to be 
inserted in the plasma membrane or is not effective 
during iron transport. 

Patients with the heritable disorder hemochroma-
tosis, characterized by excessive iron absorption and 

tissue deposits, require periodic withdrawals of blood 
and the administration of iron chelators to facilitate 
the excretion of complexed iron in the urine. 

A  decrease  in  iron  by  excessive  menstrual  ﬂow 
or gastrointestinal bleeding determines a reduction 
in  hemoglobin-containing  iron.  RBCs  are  smaller 
(microcytic anemia, see below) and underpigmented 
(hypochromic anemia).

Pathology: Vitamin B12, megaloblastic anemia, and  
microcytic anemia
Megaloblastic hematopoiesis is caused by deﬁciencies 
in vitamin B12 or  folic acid. Folic acid regulates the 
folate metabolism leading to the increased availabil-
ity of purines and deoxythymidine monophosphate 
(dTMP) required for DNA synthesis. 

Vitamin B12 (known as extrinsic factor) binds to 
intrinsic factor, a protein produced by the parietal 
cells in the gastric glands. The vitamin B12–intrinsic 
factor complex binds to speciﬁc receptor sites in the 
ileum, transported across enterocytes, and released in 
blood, where it binds to the transport protein trans-
cobalaphilin III. 

A decrease in vitamin B12, due mainly to insufﬁcient 
production of intrinsic factor or hydrochloric acid in 
the stomach, or both, can affect folate metabolism 
and folate uptake, thereby impairing DNA synthesis 
in bone marrow. 

Vitamin  B12  deﬁciency  is  rare  because  the  liver 
stores up to a 6-year supply of vitamin B12. Under 
deﬁciency conditions, the maturation of the erythroid 
cell progeny slows down, causing abnormally large 
RBCs  (macrocytes)  with  fragile  cell  membranes, 
resulting in the destruction of RBCs (megaloblastic 
anemia; see Box 6-E and Figure 6-29).

 Microcytic anemias are characterized by RBCs that 
are smaller than normal. The smaller size is due to a 
decrease in the production of hemoglobin caused by:
1. A lack of the hemoglobin product. Thalassemias 
are  diseases  of  hemoglobin  synthesis. Thalassemia 
subtypes  are  named  after  the  hemoglobin  chain 
involved. 

2.  Limited  iron  availability  and  suppression  of 
erythropoietin  renal  production  by  inﬂammatory 
cytokines during inﬂammatory states.

3. A lack of iron delivery to the heme group of 
hemoglobin (iron-deﬁcient anemia), the most com-
mon cause. Because of the iron loss through menses, 
women  are  at  greater  risk  for  iron  deﬁciency  than 
men.

4.  Defects  in  the  synthesis  of  the  heme  group 
(iron-utilization sideroblastic anemias).  Sideroblastic 
anemias  are  characterized  by  the  presence  in  bone 
marrow of ringed sideroblasts, erythroid precursors 
with  perinuclear  mitochondria  loaded  with  non-
heme iron.

Essential concepts

Blood and Hematopoiesis

• Blood is a specialized connective tissue 
consisting of plasma (an equivalent to extra-
cellular matrix) and cells.  Plasma contains 
proteins, salts, and organic compounds. 
Plasma contains ﬁbrinogen; serum, the ﬂuid 
after blood coagulation, is ﬁbrinogen-free. The 
cellular elements of the blood are red blood 
cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) and leukocytes 
(white blood cells). Platelets are fragments of 
megakaryocytes.
 
• RBCs (4 to 6 × 106/mm3; 7.8 (cid:43)m in 
diameter) are non-nucleated cells containing 
hemoglobin, a heme protein involved in the 
transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The 
plasma membrane contains a cytoskeleton 
consisting of glycophorin and anion trans-
porter channel (band 3), two transmembrane 
proteins. The protein ankyrin anchors spectrin, 
a spectin (cid:95)–spectrin (cid:96) dimeric protein, to 
band 3. Spectrin tetramers are linked to a 
complex of three proteins: F-actin, tropomyo-
sin, and protein 4.1. Adducin is a calmodulin-
binding protein that favors the association of 
F-actin to spectrin.
  Elliptocytosis (caused by defective self-
assembly of spectrin, abnormal binding of 
spectrin to ankyrin, and abnormal protein 4.1 
and glycophorin) and spherocytosis (caused 
by spectrin deﬁciency) are alterations in 
the shapes of RBCs. Anemia, jaundice, and 
splenomegaly are clinical features. Sickle 
cell anemia (glutamic acid replaced by 

valine in the (cid:96)-globin chain) and thalassemia 
(defective globin (cid:95) or (cid:96) chains in hemoglobin) 
are caused by hemoglobin defects. Chronic 
hemolytic anemia is a clinical feature of the 
two conditions.
  A valuable clinical indicator of average plasma 
glucose concentration in blood is the measure-
ment of hemoglobinA1c (glycohemoglobin or 
glycated. The normal range for the hemoglobin 
A1c is between 4% and 5.6%.

  Erythroblastosis fetalis is an antibody-
induced hemolytic disease in the newborn 
caused by Rh incompatibility between mother 
and fetus. The Rh-negative mother makes 
antibodies to D antigen present on the 
surface of fetal RBCs. During a second or third 
pregnancy, anti-D antigen antibodies cause 
hemolysis of fetal RBCs. Anemia and severe 
jaundice (which causes damage to the brain, 
a condition known as kernicterus) are clinical 
manifestations of the fetus.

•  Leukocytes (6 to 10 × 103/mm3) are 
classiﬁed as granulocytes (with primary, and 
speciﬁc or secondary cytoplasmic granules) 
and agranulocytes (containing only primary 
granules).
  There are three types of granulocytes: (1) 
neutrophils (5 ×103/mm3), (2) eosinophils 
(1.5 × 102/mm3), and (3) basophils (0.3 × 
102/mm3). 
  Neutrophils (12 to 15 (cid:43)m in diameter) have 

the following characteristics: (1) They contain 
primary granules (elastase and myeloperoxi-
dase), and secondary granules (lysozyme and 
other proteases). (2) They enter a blood ves-
sel by diapedesis and leave blood circulation 
by the mechanism of homing. (3) The nuclei 
are segmented (polymorphonucleated cell).
   Eosinophils (12 to 15 (cid:43)m in diameter) 
have the following features: (1) Cytoplasmic 
granules contain eosinophil peroxidase (EP; 
binds to microorganisms to be phagocytosed 
by macrophages), major basic protein (MBP; a 
crystalline protein that disrupts the membrane 
of parasites), eosinophilic cationic protein 
(ECP; works with MBP to fragment parasites) 
and eosinophil–derived neurotoxin (EDN; with 
antiviral activity). (2) They participate in allergic 
reactions. (3) They have a bilobed nucleus 
with refractile red cytoplasmic granules con-
taining Charcot–Leyden crystal galectin. 
  Eosinophils and mast cells interact in 
asthma, a condition that causes obstruction of 
the small-caliber bronchi and bronchioles due 
to mucus hypersecretion and smooth muscle 
bronchial constriction.
  Eosinophils are usually found in the gastroin-
testinal tract, predominantly in the cecum, but 
seldom in the esophagus. However, esopha-
geal dysfunction, including dysphagia and 
abdominal pain, correlates with the increase 
of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa. This 
condition is known as eosinophilic esophagitis.

214

     6. BLOOD AND HEMATOPOIESIS

Essential concepts

  Basophils (9 to12 (cid:43)m in diameter) have the 
following features: (1) metachromatic coarse 
cytoplasmic granules and bilobed nucleus. (2) 
Similar to mast cells, basophils participate in 
allergic reactions. (3) They may leave blood 
circulation and enter the connective tissue.
  Basophils and mast cells differ in the pres-
ence of c-kit receptor and CD49b but share 
Fc(cid:161)R1receptors.
  There are two types of agranulocytes: lym-
phocytes and monocytes.
  Lymphocytes are either large lymphocytes (9 
to 12 (cid:43)m in diameter) or small lymphocytes 
(6 to 8 (cid:43)m in diameter).  
  Lymphocytes are divided into two categories: 
B lymphocytes (or B cells; originate and dif-
ferentiate in bone marrow), and T lympho-
cytes (CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytolytic 
T cells, that originate in bone marrow but 
differentiate in thymus). There are two subsets 
of T cells: TH1 and TH2 cells. We study them 
in detail in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic 
System.
  Monocytes (12 to 20 (cid:43)m in diameter) 
circulate in blood for 12 to 100 hours before 
entering the connective tissue to become 
macrophages. Monocytes become osteoclasts 
in bone under the inﬂuence of osteoblasts.

• Leukemias are the most common neoplastic 
diseases of leukocytes. There are acute and 
chronic leukemias. 
  Acute leukemias are classiﬁed as acute 
lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), when derived 
from lymphoid cells and acute myeloblastic 
leukemias (AML), when derived from myeloid, 
erythroid and megakaryocytic cell progenies. 
The diagnosis is based on the microscopic 
examination of bone marrow samples. ALL 
affects mainly children; AML affects adults.
  Chronic leukemias are classiﬁed as lympho-
cytic, myeloid and hairy-cell type leukemias. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is mainly
observed in adults (50 years and older).
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is regarded 
as a myeloproliferative condition (proliferation 
of abnormal bone marrow stem cells) affecting 
adults. Patients with CML usually have the Phil-
adelphia chromosome, a reciprocal transloca-
tion between the long arms of chromosomes 
9 and 22, designated t(9;22)(q34;q11). The 
fusion gene (abl/bcr) encodes a tyrosine 
kinase involved in cell transformation leading 
to a neoplastic phenotype. Hairy-cell leukemia 
(HCL) is a rare type of B cell leukemia.

• Homing or leukocyte recruitment is the 
mechanism by which neutrophils, lympho-
cytes, monocytes, and other cells circulating in 
blood leave a blood vessel to enter the con-
nective tissue or a lymphoid organ or tissue. 
Homing occurs in two steps: 
  (1) Selectin-mediated attachment and rolling 
of a cell on the surface of an endothelial cell.
  (2) Integrin-mediated transendothelial migra-
tion of the cell. Homing plays a signiﬁcant 
role in immune and inﬂammatory reactions, 
metastasis, and tissue morphogenesis. 
  A defect in the integrin (cid:96) subunit, the cause 
of leukocyte adhesion deﬁciency I (LAD I),  

prevents migration of leukocytes and defects 
in wound healing and persistence of inﬂam-
mation are seen. A defect in carbohydrate 
ligands for selectins, the cause of leukocyte 
adhesion deﬁciency II (LAD II), results in 
chronic inﬂammation due to recurrent infec-
tions.

• Platelets (3 × 105/mm3; 2 to 4 (cid:43)m in diam-
eter) are cytoplasmic fragment of mekaga-
ryocytes, cells stimulated by thrombopoietin. 
Platelets bind and degrade thrombopoietin, a
mechanism that regulates platelet production. 
Cytoplasmic projections, called proplatelets, 
enter blood circulation and fragment into 
platelets.
  A platelet has a central region, called a 
granulomere containing mitochondria, rough 
endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, 
and three distinct types of granules: 
  (1) Alpha ((cid:95)) granules, that store proteins 
involved in hemostatic functions as well as 
microbicidal proteins (thrombocidins and ki-
nocidins). Platelets can interact with microbial 
pathogens and play a signiﬁcant role in host 
defense against infection. 
  (2) Dense ((cid:98)) core granules, containing 
mediators of vascular tone. 
  (3) Lysosomal ((cid:104)) granules, containing 
hydrolytic enzymes participating in the dissolu-
tion of thrombi. 
  A peripheral region, called a hyalomere, 
has microtubules and microﬁlaments and an 
invaginated membrane system. 
  The plasma membrane is coated by glyco-
protein1b (GP1b) and GP2b-GP3a, involved in 
the attachment of platelets to von Willebrand’s 
factor. Deﬁciency of these two proteins, and 
factors of the blood clotting cascade, causes 
bleeding disorders (GP1b receptor–factor IX: 
Bernard-Soulier syndrome; von Willebrand’s 
factor–factor VIII: von Willebrand’s disease). 
   Adhesion of platelets to the vascular 
endothelium, in turn, is mediated by von 
Willebrand’s factor that also carries factor VIII 
coagulation factor, whereas ﬁbrinogen binds to 
GP2b-GP3a.
  Platelets promote blood clotting and help 
to prevent blood loss from damaged vessels. 
Purpura designates a color patch or spot 
on the skin caused by bleeding. Spots less 
than 3 mm in diameter are called petechiae; 
spots larger than 1 cm in diameter are called 
ecchymoses. Petechiae and ecchymoses 
are characteristic of the Henoch–Schönlein 
syndrome, an allergic purpura reaction caused 
by drug hypersensitivity. 
  Thrombocytosis is an increase in circulating 
platelets. Thrombocytopenia is a reduction 
in the number of platelets (less than 1.5 × 
105/mm3) circulating in blood. Autoimmune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is caused 
by antibodies targeting platelets or megakaryo-
cytes, or drugs (penicillin, sulfonamides, and 
digoxin). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (TTP) is determined by pathologic 
changes in endothelial cells producing proco-
agulant substances. This condition leads to the 
aggregation of platelets in small blood vessels.

• Blood clotting or hemostasis. The process 
involves the conversion of proenzymes (des-
ignated factor X) to active enzymes (designat-
ed factor Xa) by proteolysis. It is characterized 
by an extrinsic pathway (initiated by damage 
outside a blood vessel), and an intrinsic 
pathway (initiated by damage inside a blood 
vessel, usually the wall of the vessel). Extrinsic 
and intrinsic pathways converge to a common 
pathway in which ﬁbrinogen is converted to 
ﬁbrin and platelets begin to attach to the ﬁbrin 
mesh.
  Hemophilia is a common hereditary disease 
associated with serious bleeding due to an 
inherited deﬁciency of factor VIII or factor IX.
  The genes for these blood coagulation 
factors lie on the X chromosome, and when 
mutated, they cause the X-linked recessive 
traits of hemophilia A and B. Hemophilia af-
fects males, with females as carriers.
  A reduction in the amount or activity of 
factor VIII, a protein synthesized in the liver, 
causes hemophilia A. A deﬁciency in factor IX 
determines hemophilia B.
  Major trauma or surgery can determine 
severe bleeding in all hemophiliacs and, 
therefore, a correct diagnosis is critical. 
Plasma-derived or genetically engineered 
recombinant factors are available for the treat-
ment of patients with hemophilia.

• Hematopoiesis is the formation of blood 
cells in the bone marrow (adult). The bone 
marrow consists of two microenvironmental
domains, called niches: 
  (1) The vascular niche. 
  (2) The endosteal niche. Niches provide 
physical support, soluble factors, and cell-
mediated interactions to regulate cell self 
renewal, differentiation and quiescence of 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). 
  The vascular niche is a framework of blood 
vessels surrounded by a distinct perivascular 
population of non-hematopoietic cells stromal 
cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, 
adipose cells, endothelial cells,abundant re-
ticular stromal cells and macrophages. Marrow 
reticular stromal cells produce hematopoietic 
growth factors and cytokines that regulate the 
production and differentiation of blood cells. 
Marrow macrophages remove apoptotic cells.
  The endosteal niche, located at the end-
osteum–bone marrow interface, consists of 
preosteoblasts (osteprogenitor cells), osteo-
blasts and osteoclasts interacting with HSCs. 
Osteoblasts produce multiple hematopoietic
cytokines, including G-CSF (granulocyte-col-
ony stimulating factor), M-CSF (macrophage-
colony stimulating factor}, GM-CSF (granulo-
cyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor), 
IL-1, IL-6, and IL-7.
  Hematopoietic cell populations. The bone 
marrow consists of: 
  (1) HSCs, capable of self-renewal. 
  (2) Committed precursor cells, responsible 
for the generation of distinct cell lineages. 
  (3) Maturing cells, differentiating cells de-
rived from committed precursor cells.
  The HSC gives rise to the myeloid stem cell 
and the lymphoid stem cell.

  The myeloid stem cell generates ﬁve colony-
forming units (CFU): 
  (1) Erythroid CFU. 
  (2) Megakaryocyte CFU.
  (3) Basophil CFU. 
  (4) Eosinophil CFU.
  (5) Granulocyte-macrophage CFU. The 
granulocyte-macrophage CFU gives rise to 
neutrophils and monocytes. 
  The proliferation and maturation of the CFU 
is controlled by hematopoietic growth factors 
(called hematopoietic cytokines) produced 
by cells of the marrow stromal compartment 
and outside the bone marrow. There are three 
major groups of hematopoietic growth factors:
  (1) Colony-stimulating factors (CSF).
  (2) Erythropoietin (EPO).
  (3) Cytokines (mainly interleukins). 

• Erythroid lineage consists of the follow-
ing sequence: proerythroblast, basophilic 
erythroblast, polychromatophilic erythroblast, 
orthochromatic erythroblast, reticulocyte, and 
erythrocyte. 
  EPO is the major regulator; it stimulates the 
erythroid CFU cell, the derived cell, called 
mature or primitive progenitor, and the 
proerythroblast. EPO is produced by juxtaglo-
merular interstitial cells of the renal cortex. The 
effectiveness of erythropoietin treatment can 
be monitored by an increase of reticulocytes in 
circulating blood.

• Leukopoiesis is the development of cells 
of the granulocyte (neutrophil, basophil, and 
eosinophil) and agranulocyte (lymphocyte and 
monocyte) lineage. The granulocyte lineage 
consists of the following sequence: myeloblast, 
promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, 
band cell, and mature form. Neutrophil and 
macrophage cell lines share a common precur-
sor cell lineage: the granulocyte–macrophage
CFU. Eosinophils and basophils derive from in-
dependent eosinophil and basophil CFUs. The 
basophil CFU produces basophils and mast 
cell precursors, a lineage speciﬁcation that is 
regulatedby the expression of the transcription 
factors GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) and 
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-(cid:95) (C/EBP(cid:95)).
  A characteristic of granulocytes is the appear-
ance in the cytoplasm of primary (azurophilic) 
granules (promyelocyte and myelocyte), fol-
lowed by secondary or speciﬁc granules (from 
myelocyte on). Primary granules coexist with 
secondary or speciﬁc granules.
  Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and 
monocytes.
  The lymphocyte lineage follows two path-
ways: 
  (1) B cells originate and mature in bone 
marrow. 
  (2) T cells originate in bone marrow and 
mature in thymus. A lymphoblast gives rise to 
a prolymphocyte, which matures as a lympho-
cyte. B and T cells are morphologically similar 
but functionally different. 
  The monocyte lineage derives from the 
granulocyte-macrophage CFU. A monoblast 
gives rise to a promonocyte; the ﬁnal stage is 
monocyte, which differentiates in connective 

tissue into macrophage, and in bone differenti-
ates into osteoclast.  
  Agranulocytes contain primary granules 
(lysosomes).

• CSF and interleukins. G-CSF stimulates the 
development of neutrophils. GM-CSF stimu-
lates the formation of neutrophils, eosinophils, 
basophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells 
(present in lymphoid organs and lymphoid 
tissues). Interleukins play an important role in 
the development and function of the lymphoid 
lineage. Interleukins act synergistically with CSF, 
SCF, and Flt3 ligand to stimulate the develop-
ment of the hematopoietic stem cells.  

• Megakaryocyte (also called thrombocyte, 50 
to 100 μm in diameter), the precursor cells of 
the platelet, derives from the megakaryoblast 
(15 to 50 μm in diameter), a cell derived from 
the megakaryocyte CFU. The megakaryocyte 
has an irregularly multilobed nucleus produced 
by an endomitotic nuclear division process in 
which DNA replication occurs without cell divi-
sion (polyploid nucleus).
  The megakaryocyte can be mistaken for the 
osteoclast, another large cell in bone that is 
multinucleated instead of multilobed.
  The cytoplasm shows a network of demar-
cation zones formed by the invagination of 
the plasma membrane. The coalescence of 
the invaginated membranes results in the 
formation of proplatelets released directly into 
the marrow sinusoidal space where they frag-
ment into preplatelets and then into platelets. 
Platelets play important roles in maintaining 
the integrity of blood vessels.

• Stem cell factor (SCF) is a ligand protein 
produced by fetal tissues and reticular stromal 
cells of the bone marrow. SCF binds to c-kit 
receptor, a tyrosine kinase. SCF makes HSCs 
responsive to other cytokines.
  The c-kit receptor is expressed by the c-kit 
protooncogene. Mutations in genes express-
ing c-kit receptor and/or SCF cause: anemia, 
defective development of melanocytes in skin, 
reduced migration, survival and proliferation 
of primordial germinal cells in the developing 
ovaries and testes and arrest in the develop-
ment of mast cells.

• Iron-overload disorders. In addition to 
erythropoietin, the formation of RBCs is highly 
dependent on iron metabolism and the water-
soluble vitamins folic acid (folacin) and vitamin 
B12 (cobalamin).
  Several iron-binding proteins store and trans-
port iron, for example, hemoglobin in RBCs, 
myoglobin in muscle tissue, cytochromes and 
various nonheme enzymes. Approximately 
65–75% of iron is found in the hemoglobin 
of RBCs in the form of heme. The liver stores 
about 10–20% of iron in the form of ferritin.
  Systemic iron levels are controlled by: 
  (1) Absorption. Iron is absorbed in the 
duodenum.
  (2) Recycling. Iron recycling of senescent 
erythrocytes by spleen and liver macrophages 
is the majority of the body’s iron supply. 

  (3) Mobilization of iron stores in the liver.
  In blood plasma, iron is bound to transferrin 
(Tf). Tf delivers iron to cells that express Tf 
receptors. Tf, produced in the liver, and lacto-
ferrin, present in maternal milk, are nonheme 
proteins involved in the transport of iron. Tf 
bound to two Fe(III) ions is called ferrotrans-
ferrin.  When Tf is devoid of iron is called 
apotransferrin.
  The internalization of the Tf-Fe(III) complex 
is dependent on Tf receptor phosphorylation 
triggered by Ca2+-calmodulin and the protein 
kinase C complex.
  Inside the cell, Fe(III) is released within the 
acidic endosomal compartment and is con-
verted to Fe(II) by the endosomal ferrireduc-
tase STEAP3. Fe(II) is then transported out of 
the endosome into the cytosol by DMT1 (for 
divalent metal transporter-1) and either stored 
in ferritin or incorporated into hemoglobin in
RBCs. The Tf receptor complex is recycled back 
to the plasma membrane.
  Ferritin is a major protein synthesized in the 
liver. When the storage capacity of ferritin
is exceeded, iron is deposited as hemosiderin. 
Ferritin with little iron is called apoferritin.
  Fe(II) is exported from the ferritin cell storage 
by the iron exporter ferroportin. The function 
of ferroportin is tightly controlled by hepcidin 
according to the body iron levels.
Exported Fe(II) is converted to Fe(III) by the 
membrane associated ferroxidase, hephaestin, 
before entering the blood circulation. 
  Hepcidin is a negative regulator of iron 
transport: hepcidin expression increases when 
body iron is abundant and decreases when 
there is iron deﬁciency.
  Under physiologic conditions, the expression 
of hepatic hepcidin is regulated by several pro-
teins: the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, 
called HFE (for high iron [Fe]), Tf receptor, 
hemojuvelin (HJV), bone morphogenic protein 
6 (BMP6), matriptase-2,
neogenin and Tf. Defective expression of 
hepcidin will take place when any one of these 
proteins, in particular HVJ, is missing.
  Under hypoxic conditions, the transcription 
factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1(cid:95) (HIF-1(cid:95)) 
binds to the promoter of the HAMP gene and 
blocks the expression of hepcidin. Iron-over-
load diseases, such as hereditary hemochro-
matosis (HH), can occur when misregulation 
of HAMP gene expression takes place.
  Patients with idiopathic hemochromato-
sis absorb and deposit an excess of iron in 
tissues. A decrease in iron by excessive men-
strual ﬂow or gastrointestinal bleeding results 
in small RBCs (microcytic anemia). 

• Megaloblastic hematopoiesis is caused by 
deﬁciencies in vitamin B12 or folic acid.
  Vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor produced 
by parietal cells in the stomach. The vitamin 
B12–intrinsic factor complex binds to a speciﬁc 
receptor site in the ileum (small intestine), 
absorbed by enterocytes, and released into 
the bloodstream, where it binds to trans-co-
balaphilin III, a transport protein. Megaloblas-
tic anemia occurs when there are deﬁciencies 
of folate and vitamin B12.

     6. BLOOD AND HEMATOPOIESIS

Essential concepts

7. Muscle Tissue

Muscle is one of the four basic tissues. There are three types of muscle: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. All three 
types are composed of elongated cells, called muscle cells, myoﬁbers, or muscle ﬁbers, specialized for contrac-
tion. In all three types of muscle, energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transformed into 
mechanical energy. Skeletal muscle disorders (myopathies) can be congenital and also caused by disruption 
of normal nerve supply, mitochondria dysfunction, inﬂammation (myositis), autoimmunity (myasthenia gravis), 
tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma) and injury. Cardiomyopathies affect the blood pumping ability and normal elec-
trical rhythm of the heart muscle. This chapter describes structural aspects of the three types of muscle within 
a functional and molecular framework conducive to the understanding of the pathophysiology of myopathies.

Skeletal muscle
Muscle  cells  or  ﬁbers  form  a  long  multinucleated 
syncytium grouped in bundles surrounded by con-
nective tissue sheaths and extending from the site of 
origin to their insertion (Figure 7-1). 

The epimysium is a dense connective tissue layer 
ensheathing  the  entire  muscle. The  perimysium 
derives from the epimysium and surrounds bundles 
or  fascicles  of  muscle  cells. The  endomysium  is  a 
delicate layer of reticular ﬁbers and extracellular ma-
trix surrounding each muscle cell. Blood vessels and 
nerves use these connective tissue sheaths to reach the 
interior of the muscle. An extensive capillary network, 
ﬂexible to adjust to contraction-relaxation changes, 
invests individual skeletal muscle cell.

The connective tissue sheaths blend and radiating-

muscle fascicles interdigitate at each end of a muscle 
with regular dense connective tissue of the tendon to 
form a myotendinous junction. The tendon anchors 
into a bone through the periosteal Sharpey’s ﬁbers. 

Characteristics of the skeletal muscle cell or ﬁber
Skeletal  muscle  cells  are  formed  in  the  embryo  by 
the fusion of myoblasts that produce a postmitotic, 
multinucleated myotube. The myotube matures into 
the long muscle cell with a diameter of 10 to 100 (cid:43)m 
and a length of up to several centimeters.

The plasma membrane of the muscle cell (called 
the sarcolemma) is surrounded by a basal lamina and 
satellite cells (Figure 7-2). We discuss the signiﬁcance 
of satellite cells in muscle regeneration. 

The  sarcolemma  projects  long,  ﬁnger-like  pro-

Myofilaments are components of a myofibril. There are two major classes of 
myofilaments:  (1) the thin actin filaments;  (2) the thicker myosin filaments. The 
cross-banded pattern of striated (skeletal or cardiac) muscle is due to the 
orderly arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. Actin is the predominant 
component of the I band. Myosin is the main component of the A band.  I and A 
bands form a sarcomere, which extends between two adjacent Z disks.

cesses, called transverse tubules or T tubules, into 
the cytoplasm of the cell, the sarcoplasm. T tubules 
make contact with membranous sacs or channels, the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum.  

The sarcoplasmic reticulum contains high concen-
trations of Ca2+. The site of contact of the T tubule 
with  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  cisternae  is  called 
a triad because it consists of two lateral sacs of the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum and a central T tubule.

The many nuclei of the muscle ﬁber are located at 
the periphery of the cell, just under the sarcolemma. 
About  80%  of  the  sarcoplasm  is  occupied  by 
myoﬁbrils surrounded by mitochondria (called sar-
cosomes). Myoﬁbrils are composed of two major ﬁla-
ments formed by contractile proteins: thin ﬁlaments 
contain actin, and thick ﬁlaments are composed of 
myosin (see Figure 7-2). 

Depending on the type of muscle, mitochondria 
may be found parallel to the long axis of the myo-
ﬁbrils, or they may wrap around the zone of thick 
ﬁlaments. Thin ﬁlaments insert into each side of the 
Z disk (also called band, or line) and extend from 
the Z disk into the A band, where they alternate with 
thick ﬁlaments.

The myoﬁbril: A repeat of sarcomere units
The sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of striated 
muscle  (Figure  7-3).  Sarcomere  repeats  are  repre-
sented by myoﬁbrils  in the sarcoplasm of skeletal 
and cardiac muscle cells. 

The arrangement of thick (myosin) and thin (actin) 
myoﬁlaments of the sarcomere is largely responsible 

for  the  banding  pattern  observed  under  light  and 
electron microscopy (see Figures 7-2 and 7-3). Actin 
and  myosin  interact  and  generate  the  contraction 
force. The  Z  disk  forms  a  transverse  sarcomeric 
scaffold to ensure the efﬁcient transmission of the 
generated force.

Thin myoﬁlaments measure 7 nm in width and 1 
(cid:43)m in length and form the I band. Thick ﬁlaments 
measure 15 nm in width and 1.5 (cid:43)m in length and 
are found in the A band.  

The A band is bisected by a light region called the 
H band (see Figures 7-3 and 7-4). The major com-
ponent of the H band is the enzyme creatine kinase,
which catalyzes the formation of ATP from creatine 
phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  We 
discuss later how creatine phosphate maintains steady 
levels of ATP during prolonged muscle contraction.
 Running through the midline of the H band is 
the M line. M-line striations correspond to a series of 
bridges and ﬁlaments linking the bare zone of thick 
ﬁlaments. Thin ﬁlaments insert into each side of the 
Z disk, whose components include (cid:95)-actinin. 

Components of the thin and thick ﬁlaments of the 
sarcomere
F-actin, the thin ﬁlament of the sarcomere, is double-
stranded and twisted. F-actin is composed of globular 
monomers (G-actin; see Cytoskeleton in Chapter 1, 
Epithelium). 

As you recall, G-actin monomers bind to each other 
in a head-to-tail fashion, giving the ﬁlament polarity, 
with barbed (plus) and pointed (minus) ends. The

barbed end of actin ﬁlaments inserts into the Z disk.
F-actin forms a complex with tropomyosin and 
troponins. Tropomyosin runs in the groove formed 
by  F-actin  strands. Tropomyosin  consists  of  two 
nearly identical (cid:95)-helical polypeptides twisted around 
each other.   Each molecule of tropomyosin extends 
for the length of seven actin monomers and binds 
the troponin complex (Figure 7-5).

Troponin is a complex of three proteins: troponin 

I, C, and T. 

1. Troponin T  binds the complex to tropomyosin.
2. Troponin I inhibits the binding of myosin to 

actin. 

3. Troponin C binds Ca2+ and is found only in 

striated muscle.

  Myosin  II,  the  major  component  of  the  thick 
ﬁlament,  has  adenosine  triphosphatase  (ATPase) 
activity  (it  hydrolyzes  ATP)  and  binds  to  F-actin, 
the  major  component  of  the  thin  ﬁlament,  in  a 
reversible fashion. 

Myosin II consists of two identical heavy chains
and two pairs of light chains (Figure 7-6; see Cyto-
skeleton in Chapter 1, Epithelium). At one end, each 
heavy chain forms a globular head. Two different light 
chains are bound to each head: the essential light 
chain and the regulatory light chain. 

The globular head has three distinct regions: 
1. An actin-binding region.
2. An ATP-binding region.
3. A light chain–binding region.

Tropomyosin consists of two nearly identical (cid:95)-helical polypeptides twisted

Each molecule of tropomyosin extends for the length of seven actin monomers 
and binds the troponin complex.
    Troponin is a complex of three proteins: troponin I, C, and T. Troponin T 
binds the complex to tropomyosin. Troponin I inhibits the binding of myosin to 
actin. Troponin C binds Ca2+ and is found only in striated muscle.

Myosin II, like the other molecular motors kines-
ins and dyneins, use the chemical energy of ATP to 
drive conformational changes that generate motile 
force. As you recall, kinesins and dyneins move along 
microtubules. Myosins move along actin ﬁlaments to 
drive muscle contraction.

Nebulin (Figure 7-7) is a giant protein (600–900- 
kd) associated with thin (F-actin) ﬁlaments; it inserts 
into the Z disk and acts as a stabilizer required for 
maintaining the length of F-actin.

Titin (see Figure 7-7) is a very large protein with a 
molecular mass in the range of millions determined 
by about 34,000 amino acids. Each molecule associ-
ates with thick (myosin) myoﬁlaments and inserts 
into the Z disk, extending to the bare zone of the 
myosin ﬁlaments, close to the M line. 

Titin has the following functions:

Figure 7-6. Myosin II

Myosin II heads provide the driving 
force for movement.  ATP drives the 
movement of myosin heads along

Myosin II has a long (cid:95)-helical 
coiled-coil tail that enables several 
molecules to self-assemble into a 
large bipolar aggregate or filament.

1. It controls the assembly of the thick myoﬁlament 

by acting as a template. 

2. It regulates sarcomere elasticity by establishing a 
spring-like connection between the end of the thick 
myoﬁlament and the Z disk. 

3. It limits the displacement range of the sarcomere 

in tension.

Z disks are the insertion site of actin ﬁlaments of 
the sarcomere. A  component of the Z disk, (cid:95)-actinin, 
anchors the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments to the Z 
disk.  

Desmin is a 55-kd intermediate (10-nm) ﬁlaments 
protein with three major roles essential for the main-
tenance of the mechanical integrity of the contractile 
apparatus in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle: 

1. Desmin stabilizes  myoﬁbrils and nuclei. Desmin 
ﬁlaments encircle the Z disks of  myoﬁbrils and are 
linked  to  the  Z  disk  and  to  each  other  by  plectin 
ﬁlaments  (Figure  7-8).  Desmin  ﬁlaments  extend 
from  the  Z  disk  of  one  myoﬁbril  to  the  adjacent 
myoﬁbril, forming a supportive latticework. Desmin 
ﬁlaments  also  extend  from  the  sarcolemma  to  the 
nuclear envelope. 

2. Desmin links myoﬁbrils to the sarcolema. Des-
min  inserts  into  specialized  sarcolemma-associated 
plaques,  called    costameres.  Costameres,  acting  in 
concert with the dystrophin-associated protein com-
plex, transduce contractile force from the Z disk to the 
basal lamina, maintain the structural integrity of the 
sarcolemma, and stabilize the position of myoﬁbrils 
in the sarcoplasm.

3. Desmin determines the distribution and func-
tion of mitochondria in skeletal and cardiac muscle. 
In  the  absence  of  desmin,  proper  mitochondrial 
positioning  is  lost  and  mitochondrial  function  is 
compromised, leading to cell death by either energy 
deprivation or release of proapoptotic cytochrome c.
 The heat shock protein (cid:95)B-crystallin protects des-
min ﬁlaments from stress-induced damage. Desmin, 
plectin, and (cid:95)B-crystallin form a mechanical stress 
protective network at the Z-disk level. 

Mutations in these three proteins determines the 
destruction  of  myoﬁbrils  after  repetitive  mechani-
cal stress, conducive to the development of dilated 
cardiomyopathy,  skeletal  myopathy  and  smooth 
muscle defects.  

Mechanism of muscle contraction
During  muscle  contraction,  the  muscle  shortens 
about one third of its original length.  The relevant 
aspects of muscle shortening are summarized in Figure 
7-9 as follows:

1. The length of the thick and thin ﬁlaments does 
not change during muscle contraction (the length of 
the A band and the distance between the Z disk and 
the adjacent H band are constant).

elasticity of the sarcomere and

deliver contractile signals to myoﬁbrils located in the 
interior of the muscle cell?

An  excitation-contraction  signal  is  generated  by 
acetylcholine, a chemical transmitter released from 
a nerve terminal in response to an action potential. 
Acetylcholine diffuses into a narrow gap, called the 
neuromuscular junction, between the muscle and a 
nerve terminal (Figure 7-11). The  action potential 
spreads from the sarcolemma to the T tubules, which 
transport the excitation signal to the interior of the

ATP is a source of chemical energy during the interaction of myosin and actin 
resulting in muscle contraction.  When the concentration of ATP decreases, a 
back up source of energy is the hydrolysis of creatine phosphate. 
   Creatine kinase catalyzes a reversible reaction generating creatine and ATP 
from the hydrolysis of creatine phosphate.  Newly synthesized creatine 
phosphate derives from mitochondria and shuttles phosphate groups between 
mitochondria and the myofibril.

around every sarcomere of every myoﬁbril at the A-I 
junction. 

We  discuss  later  that  the  companions  of  the T 
tubule, the channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, 
contain calcium ions. Calcium ions are released inside 
the cytosol to activate muscle contraction when the 
action potential reaches the T tubule. This excitation-
contraction sequence occurs in about 15 milliseconds.

Neuromuscular junction: Motor end plate
The neuromuscular junction is a specialized structure 
formed  by  motor  nerves  associated  with  the  target 
muscle and visible with the light microscope.

Once inside the skeletal muscle, the motor nerve 
gives rise to several branches. Each branch forms swell-
ings called presynaptic buttons covered by Schwann 
cells.  Each nerve branch innervates a single muscle 
ﬁber. The “parent” axon and all of the muscle ﬁbers 
it innervates form a motor unit.  Muscles that require 
ﬁne control have few muscle ﬁbers per motor unit. 
Very large muscles contain several hundred ﬁbers per 
motor unit.

When  myelinated  axons  reach  the  perimysium, 
they  lose  their  myelin  sheath    but  the  presynaptic 
buttons remain covered with Schwann cell processes. 
A  presynaptic  button  contains  mitochondria  and 
membrane-bound vesicles ﬁlled with the neurotrans-
mitter acetylcholine. The neurotransmitter is released 
at dense areas on the cytoplasmic side of the axon 
membrane, called active zones. 

Synaptic buttons occupy a depression of the muscle 
ﬁber, called the primary synaptic cleft. In this region, 
the sarcolemma is thrown into deep junctional folds 
(secondary synaptic clefts). Acetylcholine receptors

 Box 7-A | Functional types of muscle ﬁbers

•  A single action potential through a motor unit determines a twitch contraction. 
Most skeletal muscles consist of muscle ﬁbers of the twitch type capable of 
postural maintenance or brief bursts of intense activity.   
•  Most skeletal muscles in humans consist of a combination of different types of 
muscle ﬁbers difﬁcult to identify in routine histological preparations. 
•  Three main categories are distinguished. Type I muscle ﬁbers are slow-
contracting and fatigue-resistant (red ﬁbers; rich in myoglobin and blood supply). 
Type IIA muscle ﬁbers are fast-contracting and moderately fatigue-resistant 
(white ﬁbers). Type IIB muscle ﬁbers are fast-contracting and not fatigue-
resistant.  
•  Type I, type IIA, and type IIB muscle ﬁbers contain myosin heavy-chain 
isoforms differing in the rate of ATPase activity.  ATPase histochemistry enables 
identiﬁcation of the different types of muscle ﬁbers.

The  basal  lamina  surrounding  the  muscle  ﬁber

contains  acetylcholinesterase,  which  inactivates 
acetylcholine released from the presynaptic buttons

lamina of the muscle ﬁber. 

Clinical  signiﬁcance:  Disorders  of  neuromuscular 
transmission
Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction 
can be affected by curare and botulinum toxin (see 
Figure 7-11). 

Myasthenia gravis is an 
autoimmune disease in which 
antibodies are produced against 
acetylcholine receptors. 
Antibodies bind to the receptor, 
preventing the binding of 
acetylcholine. This blocks normal 
nerve-muscle interaction and 
results in progressive muscle 
weakness.

Curare  binds  to  the  acetylcholine  receptor  and 
prevents  binding  of  acetylcholine.  Curare  deriva-
tives are used in surgical procedures in which muscle 
paralysis is necessary.

Botulinum toxin, an exotoxin from the bacterium 
Clostridium botulinum, prevents the release of ace-
tylcholine at the presynaptic end. Muscle paralysis 
and dysfunction of the autonomous nervous system 
occur in cases of food poisoning mediated by botu-
linum toxin. 

Myasthenia  gravis  is  an  autoimmune  disease  in 
which antibodies are produced against acetylcholine 
receptors (Figure 7-12).  Autoantibodies bind to the 
receptor,  preventing  the  binding  of  acetylcholine. 
This  blocks  normal  nerve-muscle  interaction  and 
results in progressive muscle weakness.

Calcium controls muscle contraction
In  the  absence  of  Ca2+,  muscle  is  relaxed  and  the 
troponin-tropomyosin  complex  blocks  the  myosin 
binding site on the actin ﬁlament.

When  a  depolarization  signal  arrives,  Ca2+  exits 
the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
with the help of the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ chan-
nel (Figure 7-13). In the sarcomere, Ca2+ binds to 
troponin C and causes a change in conﬁguration of 
the troponin-tropomyosin complex. As a result, the 
myosin-binding site on the actin ﬁlament is exposed. 
Myosin heads bind to the actin ﬁlament, and hydro-
lysis of ATP occurs.  

As we have seen, steady levels of ATP rely on the 

mitochondrial  supply  of  creatine  phosphate  and 
the availability of creatine kinase (see Figure 7-10).
Creatine kinase is an enzyme found in soluble form 
in the sarcoplasm and also is a component of the M-
line region of the H band. Creatine kinase catalyzes 
the  transfer  of  phosphate  from  creatine  phosphate 
to ADP.

The energy of hydrolysis of ATP produces a change 
in the position of the myosin head, and the thin ﬁla-
ments are pulled past the thick ﬁlaments. Contraction 
results in the complete overlap of the A and I bands 
(see  Figure  7-9). The  contraction  continues  until 
Ca2+ is removed.

In summary, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a network 
of smooth endoplasmic reticulum surrounding each 
myoﬁbril (see Figure 7-4), stores Ca2+. In response 
to depolarization signals, the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
releases Ca2+. When membrane depolarization ends, 
Ca2+ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
with the help of Ca2+-dependent ATPase, and binds 
to the protein calsequestrin (see Figure 7-13). Con-
traction can no longer take place.

Pathology: Muscular dystrophies
Muscular dystrophies are a group of congenital mus-
cular diseases characterized by muscle weakness, atro-
phy, elevation of serum levels of muscle enzymes, and 
destructive changes of muscle tissue (Figure 7-14).

Muscular dystrophies are caused by a deﬁciency in 
the dystrophin-associated protein (DAP) complex. 
The DAP complex consists of dystrophin and two

span.  Dystrophin,  syntrophins,  and  dystrobrevin 
are located in the sarcoplasm; dystroglycans, sarco-
glycans, and sarcospan are transmembrane glycopro-
teins. Patients with a primary defect in dystroglycans 
and syntrophins have not been identiﬁed. 

The most important muscle protein involved in 
muscular dystrophies is dystrophin, a 427-kd cyto-
skeletal protein associated to F-actin, dystroglycans, 
and syntrophins (see Figure 7-14). The absence of 
dystrophin  determines  the  loss  of  components  of 
the DAP complex.  The function of dystrophin is 
to  reinforce  and  stabilize  the  sarcolemma  during 
the stress of muscle contraction by maintaining a 
mechanical link between the cytoskeleton and the 
extracellular matrix. 

Deﬁciencies    of  dystrophin  are  characteristic  of 

Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (DMD). Most pa-
tients die young (in their late teens or early twenties) 
due to an involvement of the diaphragm and other 
respiratory muscles.

DMD is an X chromosome–linked recessive dis-
order caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. 
The disorder is detected in affected boys after they 
begin  to  walk.  Progressive  muscle  weakness  and 
wasting,  sudden  episodes  of  vomiting  (caused  by 
delayed gastric emptying), and abdominal pain are 
observed.  A typical laboratory ﬁnding is increased 
serum creatine kinase levels. 

Muscle biopsies reveal muscle destruction, absence 
of dystrophin, and a substantial reduction of sarco-
glycans, and other components of the DAP complex, 
detected by immunohistochemistry. 

Heterozygote female carriers may be asymptom-
atic or have mild muscle weakness, muscle cramps, 
and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Women 
with these mutations may give birth to affected males 
or carrier females.

proliferation in response to stress or trauma. 
   SCs are attached to the basal lamina by (cid:95)7(cid:96)1 integrin and to the 
sarcolemma of the adjacent muscle fiber by M-cadherin. The 
activation of SCs involves the upregulation of the myogenic 
regulatory factors (MRFs): (1) the bHLH (basic helix–loop–helix) 
transcription factor MYF5; (2) MYOD (myoblast determining protein); 
(3) MYG6 (muscle-specific regulatory factor) and (4) myogenin. The 
transcription factor PAX7 regulates the expression of MRFs to induce 

the proliferation and self-renewal of SCs. The c-Met receptor on the 
surface of SC has strong binding affinity for the chemotactic agent 
HGF (hepatocyte growth factor).
       Daughter cells of the activated SCs, myogenic precursor cells,

with  the  other  dystroglycan  complex  proteins  and 
the association of the sarcolemma with the extracel-

and may give rise to myogenic cells that can partici-
pate in muscle regeneration.

The pluripotent nature of satellite cells and side-
population  cells  raises  the  possibility  of  stem  cell 
therapy of a number of muscle injuries and degenera-
tive diseases, including muscular dystrophy. 

Pathology: Satellite cells and muscle regeneration
Muscle  development  involves  the  chain-like  align-
ment  and  fusion  of  committed  muscle  cell  pre-
cursors,  the  myoblasts,  to  form  multinucleated 
myotubes. 

Two important events occur during the commit-

ment of the muscle cell precursor to myogenesis: 

1. The muscle cell precursor stops dividing, de-
termined by the up regulated expression of myogenic 
regulatory factors (MRFs), MYF5 and MYOD, and 
the downregulation of PAX7, a transcription factor.
2. The muscle cell precursor initiates its terminal 
differentiation, triggered by myogenin and MRF4. 
Satellite cells are a resident stem cell population 
distinct  from  the  myoblasts. They  are  involved  in 
postnatal  skeletal  muscle  maintenance,  repair  and 
regeneration They are attached to the surface of the 
myotubes. A basal lamina surrounds the satellite cell 
and the myotube (Figure 7-15). 

Satellite cells occupy a niche, a speciﬁc site where 
they reside for an indeﬁnite period of time, produce 
a cell progeny and self-renew. Satellite cells express 
(cid:95)7(cid:96)1 integrin, linking F-actin to the basal lamina, 
and  M-cadherin,  a  calcium-dependent  adhesion 
molecule attaching the satellite cell to the sarcolemma 
of the subjacent muscle ﬁber. Capillaries are located 
close to the satellite cells.

Satellite cells are mitotically quiescent in the adult, 
but  can  reassume  self-renewal  and  proliferation  in 
response to stress or trauma.  MRF expression induces 
the proliferation of satellite cells. The descendants of 
the activated satellite cells, called myogenic precursor 
cells, undergo multiple rounds of cell division before 
they can fuse with existing or new myoﬁbers.

Quiescent satellite cells express a receptor on their 
surface encoded by the proto-oncogene c-Met. The 
c-Met  receptor  has  strong  binding  afﬁnity  for  the 
chemotactic agent HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) 
bound  to  proteoglycans  of  the  basal  lamina. The 
HGF–c-Met complex up regulates a signaling cascade 
leading to proliferation of the satellite cells and the 
expression of MRFs,  MYF5 and MYOD.

In addition to satellite cells as progenitors of the 
myogenic cells in adult skeletal muscle, a population 
of  stem  cells  in  adult  skeletal  muscle,  called  side-
population  cells,  has  the  capacity  to  differentiate 
into all major blood cell lineages as well as myogenic 
satellite cells. 

Side-population cells are present in bone marrow 

Neuromuscular spindle and Golgi tendon organ
The central nervous system continuously monitors 
the position of the limbs and the state of contraction 
of  the  various  muscles.  Muscles  have  a  specialized 
encapsulated sensor called the neuromuscular spindle 
that contains sensory and motor components (Figure 
7-16). 

A neuromuscular spindle consists of 2 to 14 spe-
cialized striated muscle ﬁbers enclosed in a fusiform 
sheath  or  capsule  of  connective  tissue  continuous  
with  the  endomysium  that  surrounds  each  of  the 
muscle ﬁbers. The ﬁbers are 5 to 10 mm long and 
therefore much shorter than the surrounding  con-
tractile muscle ﬁbers.  

The specialized muscle ﬁbers in the interior of the 
neuromuscular spindle are called intrafusal ﬁbers to 
distinguish them from the nonspecialized extrafusal 
ﬁbers (Latin extra, outside; fusus, spindle), the regular 
skeletal muscle ﬁbers. 

There are two kinds of intrafusal ﬁbers designated 

by their histologic appearance: 

1. Nuclear  bag  ﬁber,  consisting  of  a  nonstriated 

sensory bag-like region that contains many nuclei.

2. The nuclear  chain  ﬁber,  so-called  because  its 
central portion contains a chain-like array of nuclei. 
The  distal  portion  of  the  nuclear  bag  ﬁber  and 
nuclear  chain  ﬁber  is  made  up  of  striated  muscle 
components with contractile properties.

The neuromuscular spindle is innervated by two 
sensory axons. One of these axons is an Ia ﬁber. After 
crossing the capsule, the Ia ﬁber loses its myelin sheath 
and winds around the central portion of the nuclear 
bag and nuclear chain ﬁbers forming an annulospiral 
ending or primary sensory ending (see Figure 7-16)
to record the degree of tension of the intrafusal ﬁbers. 
 The  other  sensory  ﬁber,  type  II  sensory  ﬁber, 
terminates at the ends of the intrafusal ﬁbers, distant 
from the midregion, in the form of ﬂower spay end-
ings or secondary sensory ending.

Motor nerve ﬁbers derive from two types of motor 

neurons of the spinal cord: 

1. The large-diameter alpha ((cid:95)) motor neurons, 
that innervate the extrafusal ﬁbers of muscles, outside 
the spindle (not shown in Figure 7-16).

2. The small-diameter gamma ((cid:97)) motor neurons, 
that innervate the intrafusal ﬁbers within the spindle 
(A (cid:97) motor ﬁber shown in Figure 7-16).  

The neuromuscular spindle is a receptor for the 
stretch reﬂex to adjust the muscle tone. It contributes

to the clinical test of tendon reﬂexes, such as the knee 
jerk (rapid extension of the knee following tapping 
of the patellar tendon).

  How does the neuromuscular spindle work? (see 
Figure 7-16). Intrafusal muscle ﬁbers are in parallel 
with the extrafusal muscle ﬁbers. When the extrafusal 
muscle ﬁbers contract (shorten), the neuromuscular 
spindle becomes slack. If the spindle remains slack, no 
further information about changes in muscle length 
can be transmitted to the spinal cord. 

This situation is corrected by a feedback control 
mechanism by which the sensory region of the spindle 

activates gamma motor neurons, which contract the 
poles of the spindle (the contractile region). Conse-
quently, the spindle stretches. 

In addition to the neuromuscular spindle, Golgi 
tendon  organs  or  neurotendinous  spindles  (see 
Figure  7-16),  located  at  muscle-tendon  junctions, 
provide information about the tension or force of 
contraction of the skeletal muscle. 

Each Golgi tendon organ is surrounded by a con-
nective  tissue  capsule  that  encloses  a  few  collagen 
ﬁbers of the tendon. About 12 or more muscle ﬁbers, 
in series with the adjacent muscle ﬁbers, insert into

the intracapsular tendon ﬁbers. The axon of a Ib ﬁber 
pierces the caspsule, enters the receptor and branches 
in contact with the tendon ﬁbers. The sensory endings 
are stimulated by tension in the tendon. 

Afferent signals from the Golgi tendon organ reach 
the spinal cord and an inhibitory signal, from alpha 
motor  neurons,  relaxes  the  corresponding  muscle 
under tension.

This regulatory response protects against the pos-
sibility  of  muscular  damage  that  may  result  from 
excessive and strong muscle contraction. Note that, 
in contrast, the neuromuscular spindle responds to 
changes in the length of the intrafusal ﬁbers.  

One  last  point:  the  neuromuscular  spindle,  the 
Golgi  tendon  organ  and  paccinian  corpuscles  as-
sociated with the capsules of the synovial joins are 
examples  of  proprioceptors  (Latin,  proprius,  one’s 
own; capio, to take), structures that inform how the 
body is positioned and moves in space.

Cardiac muscle
Cardiac cells (or cardiocytes) are branched cylinders, 
85 to 100 (cid:43)m long, approximately 15 (cid:43)m in diam-

eter (Figures 7-17 and 7-18), with a single centrally 
located nucleus (Figure 7-19). 

The  organization  of  contractile  proteins  is  the 
same as that found in skeletal muscle. However, the 
cytomembranes exhibit some differences: 

1. T tubules are found at the level of  the Z disk, 
and  are  substantially  larger  than  those  of  skeletal 
muscle found at the A-I junction.  

2. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is not as extensive 

as that of skeletal muscle.  

3.  Diads,  rather  than  the  triads  seen  in  skeletal 
muscle, are typical in cardiocytes (see Figure 7-18). 
A diad consists of a T tubule interacting with just 
one sarcoplasmic reticulum cisterna (instead of two 
opposite cisternae, as in skeletal muscle).  

4.  Mitochondria  are  more  abundant  in  cardiac 
muscle than in skeletal muscle and contain numer-
ous cristae.

The cardiocytes are joined end-to-end by special-
ized junctional complexes called intercalated disks 
(see Figure 7-17). Intercalated disks have a steplike 
arrangement,  with  transverse  components  that 
run  perpendicular  to  the  long  axis  of  the  cell  and 
longitudinal components running in parallel to the 
cardiocyte for a distance that corresponds to one or 
two sarcomeres before it turns again to form another 
transverse component (see Figure 7-18). 
The transverse component consists of:
1. Desmosomes, which mechanically link cardiac 

cells.

2.  Fasciae  adherentes,  which  contain  (cid:95)-actinin
and  vinculin  and  provide  an  insertion  site  for  the 
actin-containing thin ﬁlaments of the last sarcomere 
of each cardiocyte (see Figure 7-19). 

  Gap  junctions,  restricted  to  the  longitudinal 
component  of  the  intercalated  disk,  enable  ionic 
communication between cells leading to synchronous 
muscle contraction. 
   The terminal ﬁbers of the conducting system of the 
heart are specialized, glycogen-rich Purkinje ﬁbers. 
Compared with the contractile ﬁbers, Purkinje ﬁbers 
are larger, paler-stained, and contain fewer myoﬁbrils 
(see  Chapter  12,  Cardiovascular  System,  for  addi-
tional details).

Clinical  signiﬁcance:  Transport  proteins  on  the 
sarcolemma of cardiocytes 
The sarcolemma of the cardiocyte contains speciﬁc 
transport proteins (see Figure 7-17)  controlling the 
release and reuptake of ions critical for systolic con-
tractile function and diastolic relaxation. 

Active  transport  of  Ca2+  into  the  lumen  of  the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum by  Ca2+-dependent ATPase 
is  controlled  by  phospholamban. The  activity  of 
phospholamban  is  regulated  by  phosphorylation.  
Changes  in  the  amount  and  activity  of  phosphol-
amban,  regulated  by  thyroid  hormone,  may  alter

Additional transporters, including the Na+- Ca2+ 
exchanger and voltage-gated K+ channels, regulate 
the intracellular levels of K+ and Na+. (cid:96)-Adrenergic

General Pathology: Myocardial infarction
Myocardial  infarction  is  the  consequence  of  a  loss 
of  blood  supply  to  the  myocardium  caused  by  an 
obstruction of an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The 
clinical  outcome  depends  on  the  anatomic  region 
affected  and  the  extent  and  duration  of  disrupted 
blood ﬂow.

Irreversible  damage  of  cardiocytes  occurs  when 
the loss of blood supply lasts more than 20 minutes.

to the fascia adherens. Desmin is linked to the desmosome. The longitudinal 
component of the intercalated disk runs parallel to the myofilaments and the long axis 
of the cell before it turns again to form another transverse component. Gap junctions 
are the major structures of the longitudinal component (not shown).

Intercalated disk

Normal cardiac tissue consists of 
branching and anastomosing striated 
cardiocytes with a central nucleus and 
intracellular contractile myofilaments. 
Intercalated disks join individual 
cardiocytes.

Myocardial ischemia caused by occlusion of 
the coronary artery results within the first 24 
hours in the necrosis of cardiocytes.
   Cardiocytes display an eosinophilic cytoplasm  
lacking the characteristic intracellular striations 
detected in the adjacent unaffected cardiocytes. 
The nuclei are pyknotic (Greek, pyknos, dense, 
thick; osis, condition) and irregularly shaped.
Lactic dehydrogenase-1 and creatine kinase 
MB*, released from dead cardiocytes, are 
detected in serum. 
   Serum levels of these enzymes remain 
elevated days after the myocardial infarction.

Three days later, the necrotic cardiocytes 
are surrounded by neutrophils.
   After 3 weeks (not shown), capillaries,  
fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes 
are observed in the necrotic area. After 3 
months, the infarcted region is replaced by 
scar tissue.

*Creatine kinase (CK) is composed of two dimers, 
M and B. CK-MM isoenzyme predominates in 
skeletal muscle and heart. CK-BB is present in 
brain, lung, and other tissues. CK-MB is 
characteristic of myocardium.

If blood ﬂow is restored in less than 20 minutes, an 
event known as reperfusion, cardiocyte cell viability is 
maintained. Timing is critical for implementing early 
therapy to reestablish blood ﬂow by using thrombo-
lytic  agents. The  histologic  changes  of  myocardial 
infarction are summarized in Figure 7-20.

Creatine kinase and its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) 
are conventional markers of myocardial necrosis.  A 
more sensitive marker is cardiocyte-speciﬁc tropo-
nin I not expressed in skeletal muscle. An increase 
of  troponin  I  in  the  serum  of  patients  with  acute 
coronary syndromes provides prognostic information 
on increased risk of death and enables treatment to 
decrease further myocardial necrosis.

Smooth muscle
Smooth muscle may be found as sheets or bundles 
in  the  walls  of  the  gut,  bile  duct,  ureters,  urinary 
bladder, respiratory tract, uterus, and blood vessels. 
Smooth muscle differs from skeletal and cardiac 
muscle:  smooth  muscle  cells  are  spindle-shaped, 

tapering cells with a central nucleus (Figure 7-21).
 The perinuclear cytoplasm contains mitochondria, 
ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgi ap-
paratus, a latticework of thick myosin  ﬁlaments, thin 
actin ﬁlaments, and intermediate ﬁlaments composed 
of desmin and vimentin. 

Actin and intermediate ﬁlaments insert into cyto-
plasmic and plasma membrane–associated structures 
rich in (cid:95)-actinin, called dense bodies. Polyribosomes, 
instead of rough endoplasmic reticulum, participate 
in the synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins (Figures 7-21 
and 7-22).

Invaginations  of  the  plasma  membrane,  called 
caveolae, act as a primitive T tubule system, trans-
mitting depolarization signals to the underdeveloped 
sarcoplasmic reticulum. The development of caveolae 
from lipid rafts and their diverse roles in several tis-
sues are shown in Figure 7-22. 

Smooth muscle cells are linked to each other by 
gap  junctions.  Gap  junctions  permit  synchronous 
contraction of the smooth muscle.

Characteristics of smooth muscle

Smooth muscle is found in the walls of tubular organs, 
the walls of most blood vessels, the iris and ciliary 
body (eye), and arrector pili muscle (hair follicles), 
among other sites.  It consists of fusiform individual 
cells or fibers with a central nucleus. Smooth cells in 
the walls of large blood vessels produce elastin.  
   Caveolae, depressions of the plasma membrane, are 
permanent structures involved in fluid and electrolyte 
transport (pinocytosis). 
    Caveolin-3, a protein encoded by a member of the 
caveolin gene family, is associated with lipid rafts. 
Complexes formed by caveolin-3 bound to cholesterol 
in a lipid raft invaginate and form caveolae. Caveolae 
detach from the plasma membrane to form pinocytotic 
vesicles.

Cross section of smooth muscle cells. Depending on the section level, a central 
nucleus is observed in some of the muscle cells.

A  basal  lamina  surrounds  each  muscle  cell  and 

serves to transmit forces produced by each cell.

Mechanism of smooth muscle contraction
The arrangement of the contractile proteins and the 
mechanism of contraction of smooth muscle differ 
from those of skeletal and cardiac muscle: 

1. Actin and myosin ﬁlaments are not organized 
in sarcomeres as seen in cardiac and skeletal muscle. 
2. Smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin 
but  do  contain  tropomyosin,  which  binds  to  and 
stabilizes actin ﬁlaments. 

3. Ca2+ ions that initiate contraction derive from 
outside  the  cell  rather  than  from  the  sarcoplasmic 
reticulum. 

4.  Myosin  light-chain  kinase  (instead  of  tropo-
nin, which is not present in smooth muscle cells) is 
responsible for the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile 
ﬁbers in smooth muscle.

We have seen that the sliding of the myosin-actin 
complex in striated muscle is the basis for contraction 
(see Figure 7-9). 

In smooth muscle, actin ﬁlaments  and associated 
myosin attach to cytoplasmic and plasma membrane

A lipid raft is a precursor of a caveola, a 
structure predominant in fibroblasts, 
adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle 
(striated and smooth). The protein caveolin 
binds to cholesterol. The caveolin gene 
family consists of caveolin-1, -2, and -3. 
    Caveolae are not seen when the caveolin 
gene is not expressed, and tissues are 
functionally abnormal (for example, 
myopathies).

 

The detachment of a pinocytotic vesicle 
from the plasma membrane initiates 
vesicular trafficking. 
   In addition, caveolae can concentrate 
signaling molecules, such as Src-like 
tyrosine kinases, G protein, and nitric 
oxide. 

dense bodies, representing the equivalent of the Z 
disk of striated muscle. Dense bodies are attached to 
the plasma membrane through desmin and vimentin 
intermediate ﬁlaments. 

When the actin-myosin complex contracts, their 
attachment to the dense bodies causes cell shortening. 

Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of myosin 
regulatory light chains is responsible for the contrac-
tion of smooth muscle. We discuss this mechanism 
in Chapter 1, Epithelium, when we analyze the role 
of different myosins in the cell (review Figure 1-32). 
Smooth  muscle  myosin  is  a  type  II  myosin, 

236

 7. MUSCLE TISSUE

Smooth muscle

consisting  of  two  heavy  chains  and  two  pairs  of 
light  chains. The  myosin  molecule  is  folded  when 
dephosphorylated. 

When type II myosin  phosphorylates, it unfolds 
and assembles into ﬁlaments. The actin binding site 
on the myosin head is exposed and myosin can then 
bind to actin ﬁlaments to cause cell contraction.

Smooth muscle can be stimulated to contract by 
nervous  stimulation,  hormonal  stimulation,  or 

stretch. For example, intravenous oxytocin stimulates 
uterine  muscle contractions during labor. 

In response to an appropriate stimulus, there is an 
increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+. Ca2+ binds to calmodu-
lin. The Ca2+-calmodulin complex activates myosin 
light-chain kinase, which catalyzes phosphorylation 
of the myosin light chain. When Ca2+ levels decrease, 
the myosin light chain is enzymatically dephosphory-
lated, and the muscle relaxes.

Essential concepts

Muscle Tissue

• There are three types of muscle: 
  (1) Skeletal muscle.
  (2) Cardiac muscle.
 (3) Smooth muscle.  
   Skeletal muscle is surrounded by the 
epimysium, a layer of dense connective tissue. 
The perimysium, derived from the epimysium, 
surrounds bundles or fascicles of muscle 
cells, also called muscle ﬁbers. Each muscle 
ﬁber within a fascicle is surrounded by the 
endomysium, a thin layer of reticular ﬁbers 
and extracellular matrix closely associated to a 
basal lamina enveloping each muscle cell. 
   Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleated 
cells, resulting from the fusion of myoblasts. 

Each skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a 
plasma membrane (called sarcolemma). The 
sarcolemma is surrounded by a basal lamina 
and satellite cells. 
  The sarcolemma projects long processes, 
called transverse tubules or T tubules, deep 
into the cytoplasm (called sarcoplasm). The 
sarcoplasm contains mitochondria (called 
sarcosomes). Each T tubule is ﬂanked by sacs 
of the endoplasmic reticulum (called sarco-
plasmic reticulum) forming a tripartite structure 
called a triad, found at the junction of the A 
band and I band. The nuclei are located at the 
periphery of the cell. An important component 
of the sarcoplasm is the myoﬁbril.   
   A myoﬁbril is a linear repeat of sarcomeres.   

Each sarcomere consists of two major cyto-
skeletal myoﬁlaments: actin and myosin. 
  Note the difference between myoﬁbril and 
myoﬁlament. The arrangement of these two 
myoﬁlaments generates a banding pattern (or 
striation), characteristic of skeletal and cardiac 
muscle tissue. There is an A band (dark) and 
I  band (light). The A band is at the center of 
the sarcomere; the Z disk bisects the I band. 
The A band is bisected by the H band, which 
contains creatine kinase. The M line runs 
through the midline of the H band.
   A sarcomere is limited by two adjacent Z 
disks. Actin inserts into each side of the Z disk. 
Myosin myoﬁlaments do not attach to the Z 
disk. Actin is associated with the tropomyosin-

troponin complex (formed by troponins I, C, 
and T) and nebulin. Myosin (called myosin II) 
consists of two identical heavy chains (with a 
globular head) and two pairs of light chains. 
The globular heads have an actin-binding 
region, and ATP-binding region, and a light 
chain–binding region. Titin is associated with 
myosin.
   Each Z disk is encircled by the intermediate 
ﬁlament desmin. Desmin ﬁlaments are linked 
to each other by plectin. The desmin-plectin 
complex forms a lattice with the opposite ends 
attached to costameres in the sarcolemma. 
This arrangement stabilizes the myoﬁbrils in 
the sarcoplasm during muscle contraction.   

• During muscle contraction, the length of 
myosin and actin myoﬁlaments does not 
change. The length of the sarcomere de-
creases because actin and myosin slide past 
each other, represented by a reduction in the 
width of the I band and H band. ATP is an 
energy source for muscle contraction. Creatine 
phosphate (produced in sarcosomes) is a 
back  up mechanism to maintain steady levels 
of ATP during muscle contraction. Creatine 
kinase catalyzes a reversible reaction generat-
ing creatine and ATP from the hydrolysis of 
creatine phosphate.
     Inside the muscle, a motor nerve gives 
rise to numerous branches, each innervating 
a single muscle cell. The motor nerve and its 
innervating branches form a motor unit.  
   An excitation-contraction signal is produced 
by the release of acetylcholine from a presyn-
aptic button into a primary synaptic cleft, an 
invagination on the surface of a muscle cell 
coated with basal lamina containing acetylcho-
linesterase. The primary synaptic cleft forms 
secondary synaptic clefts, also covered by 
basal lamina. Crests of the secondary synaptic 
clefts contain acetylcholine receptors. 
  An action potential depolarizes the sarco-
lemma, and the action potential travels inside 
the muscle cell along T tubules, which are 
in contact with channels of the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum containing calcium. Calcium ions are 
released, bind to troponin C, and initiate con-
traction by regulating myosin-actin interaction. 
When depolarization ends, calcium ions are 
pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
channels and bind to calsequestrin. 
  Botulinum toxin binds to the presynaptic 
membrane of the nerve terminal and blocks 
the release of acetylcholine. Curare binds to 
the acetylcholine receptor, prevents binding of 
acetylcholine, and induces muscle paralysis. 
  In myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune 
disease that produces fatigue with exercise, 
autoantibodies bind to the acetylcholine recep-
tor and prevent binding of acetylcholine.

• Muscular dystrophies are a group of 
congenital muscular diseases characterized 
by muscle weakness, atrophy, serum levels 
increases of muscle enzymes, and destructive 
changes in muscle tissue. 
   The following protein complexes, some of 
them part of the dystrophin-associated protein 
(DAP) complex, are present in the sarcoplasm 

or in the sarcolemma adjacent to the sarco-
plasm. They provide mechanical stabilization 
during muscle contraction: 

(1) Dystroglycan complex consists of 
dystroglycan-(cid:95) and dystroglycan-(cid:96). Dystrogly-
can-(cid:95) binds to the (cid:95) chain of laminin-2, and 
dystroglycan-(cid:96) binds to dystrophin. No primary 
defects in the dystroglycan complex have been 
identiﬁed. 

(2) Sarcoglycan complex consists of six trans-
membrane subunits ((cid:95)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:96)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:97)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:98)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:161)(cid:11)(cid:3)and(cid:3)(cid:99)). Sar-
coglycanopathies (for example, limb-girdle 
muscular dystrophies) are caused by defects 
in components of the sarcoglycan complex. 
(3) Dystrophin binds the dystroglycan com-
plex to actin in the sarcoplasm. Duchenne’s 
muscular dystrophy, an X-linked recessive 
condition, is caused by a deﬁciency in dystro-
phin. The absence of dystrophin results in the

dystrophin and dystrobrevin.

• Satellite cells are closely associated to skel-
etal muscle cells and are covered by a basal 
lamina. In mature muscle, satellite cells are 
quiescent. Activated satellite cells activated by 
trauma or mechanical stress can self-renew 
and proliferate. The expression of myogenic 
regulatory factors (for example, Myf5 and 
MyoD) activates satellite cells, which become 
myogenic precursor cells (to form muscle 
cells) or side-population cells (to differentiate 
into hematopoietic cells).

• The neuromuscular spindle is a special-
ized encapsulated length sensor of muscle 
contraction. It is supplied by sensory and mo-
tor nerves and consists of specialized muscle 
ﬁbers. Muscle ﬁbers on the interior of the neu-
romuscular spindle are called intrafusal ﬁbers 
to distinguish them from the nonspecialized 
extrafusal ﬁbers, regular skeletal muscle ﬁbers 
aligned in parallel with the intrafusal ﬁbers.
  There are two kinds of intrafusal ﬁbers desig-
nated by their histologic appearance: 
  (1) Nuclear bag ﬁber, consisting of a non 
striated sensory bag-like central region that 
contains many nuclei and striated contractile 
elements at the ends of the ﬁber. 
  (2) Nuclear chain ﬁber, so-called because its 
central portion contains a chain-like array of 
nuclei, also has striated contractile ends. 
  When extrafusal ﬁbers contract, the neu-
romuscular spindle becomes slack. This 
information is transmitted by sensory nerves to 
the spinal cord, which activates motor neurons 
that stretch the spindle. 
   This is the base of the clinical test of tendon 
reﬂexes (knee jerk).
  In contrast to the neuromuscular spindle, 
the Golgi tendon organs are located in series 
with the extrafusal muscle ﬁbers. They provide 
information about the force of contraction 
(tension) of the skeletal muscle.

• There are three major types of skeletal 
muscle ﬁbers: red ﬁbers (involved in mainte-
nance of posture), white ﬁbers (responsible 
for rapid contraction), and intermediate ﬁbers 
(a combination of the characteristics of red 
and white ﬁbers). Muscles contain a mixture 
of the three types of ﬁbers.

• Cardiac muscle consists of branched 
cylindrical cells called cardiocytes. They 
contain a central nucleus and myoﬁbrils in the 
cytoplasm. The organization of the sarcomere 
is similar to skeletal muscle. The following 
differences are observed:
  (1) T tubules and short portions of the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum form diads (instead 
of triads). 
  (2) Diads are found at the level of the Z disk 
(instead of the A-I band junction). 
  (3) Mitochondria contain abundant cristae.
  (4) Cardiocytes are joined end-to-end by 
intercalated disks. 
  (5) Intercalated disks display a steplike 
arrangement with a transverse portion (con-
taining desmosomes and fasciae adherentes), 
and a longitudinal portion (where gap junc-
tions are located).
  A specialized type of cardiac ﬁber is the 
Purkinje ﬁber, a glycogen-rich cell with fewer 
myoﬁbrils, involved in conductivity.

• Smooth muscle cells are found in the wall 
of the alimentary tube, urinary excretory 
passages, respiratory tract, uterus, and blood 
vessels.
  Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped, 
tapering cells, with a central nucleus and sur-
rounded by a basal lamina. We discussed the 
ability of smooth muscle cells to synthesize 
and secrete components of collagen and 
elastic ﬁbers. The cytoplasm contains actin, 
myosin, and intermediate ﬁlaments. 
  A typical feature of muscle cells are caveo-
lae, regarded as a primitive T tubule system.
   Caveolae develop from lipid rafts, a domain 
in the plasma membrane enriched in choles-
terol and sphingolipids. The protein caveolin 
binds to cholesterol. Caveolae are not seen 
when the caveolin gene is not expressed. The 
detachment of caveolae forms pinocytotic 
vesicles, involved in vesicular trafﬁcking and 
signaling.

• The contraction of smooth muscle cells dif-
fers from skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.
  Smooth muscle cells lack sarcomeres and 
troponin, and calcium ions initiate contraction 
from outside the cell, rather than from the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
  Myosin light-chain kinase is responsible for 
the calcium sensitivity of the contractile actin-
myosin component of smooth muscle. An 
equivalent to the Z disk of striated muscle are 
the dense bodies. 
  In response to a stimulus, an increase in 
cytoplasmic calcium binds to calmodulin. The 
calcium-calmodulin complex activates myosin 
light-chain kinase, which catalyzes phosphory-
lation of the myosin light chain and enables 
binding of activated myosin to actin.

Essential concepts

8. Nervous Tissue

Anatomically,  the nervous system can be divided into (1) the central nervous system (CNS) (the brain, spinal 
cord, and neural parts of the eye) and (2) the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (peripheral ganglia, nerves, 
and nerve endings connecting ganglia with the CNS and receptors and effectors of the body).  The CNS and 
PNS are morphologically and physiologically different, and these differences are signiﬁcant in areas such as 
neuropharmacology. The basic cell components of the CNS are neurons and glia. The PNS contains support-
ing cells called satellite cells and Schwann cells, analogous to the glial cells of the CNS. This chapter serves as 
an introduction to the Neuroscience course. In addition, the structure and function of the CNS and PNS are 
integrated with basic clinical and pathologic concepts of malformations and neurodegenerative diseases. The 
relevant molecular aspects involved in neurodegenerative diseases are integrated with structure and function. 

Development of the nervous system
The  CNS  develops  from  the  primitive  ectoderm 
(Figure  8-1  and  Box  8-A  and  Box  8-B).  A  simple 
epithelial  disk,  the  neural  plate,  rapidly  rolls  into 
a hollow cylinder, the neural tube. This process is 
known as neurulation. 

During this process, a specialized portion of the 
neural  plate,  the  neural  crest,  separates  from  the 
neural  tube  and  the  overlying  ectoderm.  In  later 
development, the neural crest forms the neurons of 
the peripheral ganglia and  other components of the 
PNS. A defect in the closing of the neural tube causes 
different congenital malformations (see Box 8-C).

Neural crest cells remain separated from the neural 

tube and differentiate into:

1. The  sensory  neurons  of  the  dorsal  root  and 

cranial nerve ganglia. 

2. The  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  motor 

neurons of the autonomic ganglia. 

Some of these cells invade developing visceral or-
gans and form the parasympathetic and enteric gan-
glia and the chromafﬁn cells of the adrenal medulla.  
The Schwann cells and satellite cells of the dorsal 
root  ganglia  also  develop  from  neural  crest  cells. 
Schwann cells ensheathe and myelinate the peripheral 
nerve  ﬁbers,  and  the  satellite  cells  encapsulate  the 
neuronal cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia.

neurons in the intermediate zone 
is eliminated by apoptosis as

       Glioblasts migrate to the cortical

plate and give rise to astrocytes and 
oligodendrocytes.  Oligodendrocytes 
form the myelin sheath of the axon 
from a neuron derived from a 
postmitotic neuron.  Myelinization 
occurs in the cortical plate.

The early neural tube consists of a pseudostrati-
ﬁed  columnar  epithelium  formed  by  three  zones 
(Figure 8-2): 

1. The  ventricular  zone,  where  progenitor  cells 
give rise to most cells of the nervous tissue (except 
microglial cells).

2. The intermediate zone, where neurons migrate 
toward the cortical plate and where excess neurons 
are destroyed by apoptosis.

3. The cortical plate, the future gray matter of the 

cerebral cortex.

In the ventricular zone, germinal or ventricular 
cells proliferate rapidly during early development to 
give rise to ependymoblasts (remaining in the ven-
tricular zone) and glioblasts and postmitotic neurons 

 Box 8-A  |  Three cell sources of the CNS

•  The ectoderm germ cell layer gives rise to three major structures: (1) the sur-
face ectoderm, primarily the epidermis of the skin (including hair, nails, and 
sebaceous glands), lens and the cornea of the eye, anterior pituitary, and tooth 
enamel; (2) the neural tube (brain and spinal cord); and (3) the neural crest.
•  Cells of the neural crest migrate away from the neural tube and generate 
components of the peripheral nervous system (Schwann cells and the sympa-
thetic and parasympathetic nervous system), the adrenal medulla, melano-
cytes of the skin, odontoblasts of the teeth, and neuroglial cells.

8. NERVOUS TISSUE

Histogenesis of the CNS

(migrating to the intermediate zone). 

Immature neurons leave the ventricular zone, mi-
grate to the intermediate zone, lose their capacity to 
undergo cell division, and differentiate into functional 
neurons. The neuronal migration mechanism and the 
consequences of abnormal migration are highlighted 
in Box 8-D.

During  this  differentiation  process,  a  selection 
process, similar to that in the thymus for T cells (see 
Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System), results in 
either neuronal heterogeneity or death. Neurons that 
become postmitotic in the intermediate zone reach 
the  outer  layers  of  the  cortical  plate  and  continue 
their differentiation.  

Once  the  production  of  immature  neurons  is 
complete, the germinal or ventricular cells produce 
glioblasts, which differentiate into astrocytes, oligo-
dendrocytes, and ependymoblasts. Ependymoblasts 
give rise to ependymal cells, lining the ventricular 
cavities  of  the  CNS,  and  choroid  epithelial  cells, 
which are components of the choroid plexus.  

Later, astrocytes develop vascular end-feet attached 
to blood vessels of the CNS. Coincident with vas-
cularization is the differentiation of microglia from 
monocytes. Microglia respond to injury and become 
active phagocytic cells. 

 Box 8-B  |  Brain development

•  By the end of the 4th week, a ﬂexion of the neural tube at the site of the future 
midbrain marks three regions: the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesenecepha-
lon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain). The prosencephalon expands 
on each side to form the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres). By the 6th 
week, the diencephalon, the remaining part of the prosencephalon, gives rise to 
the optic outgrowth (retina and optic nerve of the eye). See diagram below.
•  The embryonic brainstem consists at this point of the following components: 
(1) the prosencephalon, that gives rise, as indicated above, to the telencephalon 
(developing the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum) and the diencephalon 
(developing the thalamus and hypothalamus); (2) the mesencephalon, that  
originates the midbrain; and (3) the rhombencephalon, that gives rise to the 
pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata.
•  Dilations of the neural canal within the cerebral hemispheres form  the 
lateral ventricles, that communicate with the third ventricle located within the 
diencephalon. The choroid plexus (formed by a double layer of pia mater called 
tela choroidea) hangs from the roof of the third ventricle. The ﬂoor of the third 
ventricle consists of the infundibulum, the tuber cinereum, the mammillary 
bodies and the upper end of the midbrain.  We come back to this portion of the 
third ventricle in Chapter 18, Neuroendocrine System, when we discuss the 
hypophysis. The aqueduct of the midbrain communicates the third and fourth 
ventricles. 
•  As shown in Figure 8-2, mitotic activity occurs in the ventricular zone, outside 
the lateral ventricle. Cells migrate to the cortical plate of each hemisphere and 
form the cerebral cortex.
•  At the 14th week, frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes can be iden-
tiﬁed. The hippocampus, a cerebral cortex extension from the medial portion of 
the hemisphere link, advances into the temporal lobe leaving behind the fornix, 
a trail of ﬁbers. The concavity of the fornix embraces the choroid ﬁssure (the 
insertion line of the choroid plexus extending into the lateral ventricle) and the 
tail of the caudate nucleus (whose head is attached to the thalamus).
•  Major and minor commissures link the cerebral hemispheres: (1) The corpus 
callosum, a much larger commissure extending backward above the fornix, con-
nects the corresponding areas of the cerebral cortex of the hemispheres. (2) The 
minor anterior commissure links the olfactory, or smell, left and right regions as 
well as the temporal lobes. (3) The posterior commissure and the habenular 
commissure are located in front of the pineal gland.  (4) The commissure of 
the fornix connect one hippocampus to the other. 
•  The expanding portions of the cerebral hemispheres contact and fuse with the 
diencephalon. Consequently, the brainstem consists of three parts: midbrain, 
pons and medullas oblongata and ﬁbers from the cerebral cortex extend directly 
to the brainstem. Fibers extending from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex and 
ﬁbers from the cortex extending into the brainstem, split the corpus striatum into 
the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus.

In later development, glioblasts give rise to oligo-
dendrocytes, marking the beginning of myelination
in the CNS. In contrast to neurons, glioblasts and 
derived glial cells retain the ability to undergo cell 
division.

The number of neurons in the human brain is in 
the range of 109 to 1009. Up to 60% to 70% of these 
are present in the cerebral cortex.  Most neurons are 
present at birth  or shortly thereafter. As the brain 
continues to grow during the postnatal period, the 
number  and  complexity  of  interneuronal  connec-
tions increase. 

Cell types: Neurons
The functional unit of the nervous system is a highly 
specialized, excitable cell, the nerve cell or neuron. 
Neurons  usually  consist  of  three  principal  compo-
nents (Figures 8-3 and 8-4):

1. Soma or cell body.
2. Dendrites.
3. Axon. 
The soma contains the nucleus and its surrounding 
cytoplasm (also called perikaryon; Greek peri, around; 
karyon, nucleus). 

The dendrites are processes that arise as multiple 
treelike branches of the soma, forming  a dendritic 
tree collectively. The entire surface of the dendritic 
branches is covered by small protrusions called den-
dritic  spines.  Dendritic  spines  establish  numerous 
axonal synaptic connections, as we will see later (see 
Figure 8-7).

Neurons have a single axon originating from the 
soma at the axon hillock and ending in a terminal 
arborization, the telodendron.  Each terminal branch 
of the telodendron has an enlarged ending, the syn-
aptic terminal or synaptic bouton.

 Note that although dendrites and axons branch 
extensively, axons branch at their distal end (the telo-
dendron), whereas dendrites are multiple extensions 
of the soma or cell body. 

The surface membrane of the soma and the den-
dritic tree are specialized for the reception and inte-
gration of information, whereas the axon is specialized  
for the transmission of information in the form of 
an action potential or a nerve impulse. 

Types of neurons
Different types of neurons can be identiﬁed on the 
basis of the number and length of processes emerging 
from the soma (Figure 8-5):

According  to  the  number  of  processes,  neurons

can be classiﬁed as:

cesses  attached  to  a  polygonal-shaped  soma. The 
processes include a single axon and more than one 
dendrite. Multipolar neurons are the most abundant

 Box 8-C  |  Neural tube defects
  •  A defect in the closing of the neural tube causes different congenital malforma-
tions.

Usually, skeletal (skull or vertebral column) defects occur along with mal-

formations of the underlying brain and spinal cord.  The latter results from an 
improper closure of the neural tube during neurulation. Congenital malformations 
associated with defective neurulation are designated dysraphic (defective fusion) 
defects.  
•  Spina biﬁda is the most common of the spinal cord malformations caused by 
failure to close the posterior regions of the neural tube. The severity of spina 
biﬁda depends on the extent of spinal cord being exposed.  
•  The most severe example of a neural tube defect of the anterior region of the 
neural tube is anencephaly, a lethal condition deﬁned by the  absence of the 
brain and the surrounding bone, meninges, muscles, and skin.
•  Failure to close the skull and vertebral column is called craniorachischisis.
•  Closure of the neural tube in humans requires the expression of speciﬁc genes 
(Pax3, sonic hedgehog, and openbrain). Following closure,  the neural tube 
separates from the surface ectoderm by a process mediated by cell-adhesion 
molecules N-cadherin and neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). As you 
recall, the latter is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
• The use of periconceptional folic acid supplements prevents ~50%–75% of 
cases of neural tube defects.

neurons in the nervous system. Pyramidal cells of the 
cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells and neurons of the 
cerebellar cortex are two typical examples.

2. Bipolar neurons have two processes. Bipolar 
neurons are typical of the visual, auditory, and ves-
tibular systems.

3. Pseudounipolar neurons have only one short 
process leaving the cell body. They are localized in 
sensory ganglia of cranial and spinal nerves. Embry-

 Box 8-D  |  Neuronal migration

• Neuronal migration involves three highly regulated steps: (1) a growth cone 
extending away from the cell body; (2) a leading neurite extending from the 
growth cone and relocation of the centrosome into the neurite; and (3) assembly 
of microtubules extending from the centrosome toward the nucleus. The nucleus 
is surrounded by microtubules in a cage-like arrangement and a traction force 
pulls the nucleus toward the centrosome (nucleokinesis).  Actin is also involved 
in this migration process.
• Mutations affecting neuronal migration have signiﬁcant effects on the develop-
ment and function of the CNS. Mental retardation, epilepsy, myopia, and cranio-
facial abnormalities are observed.

8. NERVOUS TISSUE

Types of neurons

onically, pseudounipolar neurons derive from bipolar 
neuroblasts,  and  the  two  neuronal  processes  fuse 
during later development (hence the preﬁx pseudo).
Based on the length of the axon relative to the 
dendritic tree, multipolar neurons can be subclas-
siﬁed into:

1. Golgi type I neurons, when the axon extends 

beyond the limits of the dendritic tree.

2.  Golgi type II neurons, when an axon terminates 
in the immediate area of the cell body and does not 
extend beyond the limits of the dendritic tree. Small 
stellate cells of the cerebral cortex are Golgi type II 
cells.

Designation of groups of neurons and axons
In the CNS, functionally and structurally related neu-
rons form aggregates called  nuclei. An area called the 
neuropil can be found within a nucleus and between 
the neuronal cell bodies.  The term neuropil desig-
nates an area with packed dendrites, axonal branches 
with abundant synapses, and glial cells.

Clusters  of  neurons  arranged  in  a  layer  form  a 
stratum,  lamina  or  layer  (cerebral  cortex).  When 
neurons form longitudinal groups, these groups are 
designated columns (see Box 8-E).

Bundles  of  axons  in  the  CNS  are  called  tracts,
fasciculi  (bundles),  or  lemnisci  (for  example,  the 
optic tract). 

In the PNS, a cluster of neurons forms a ganglion
(plural ganglia). A ganglion can be sensory (dorsal 
root  ganglia  and  trigeminal  ganglion)  or  motor 
(visceromotor or autonomic ganglia). Axons derived 
from a ganglion are organized as nerves, rami (sin-
gular ramus), or roots.

Synaptic terminals and synapses
The synaptic terminal  (Figure 8-6) is specialized for 
the transmission of a chemical message in response 
to an action potential. The synapse is the junction 
between the presynaptic terminal of an axon and a 
postsynaptic membrane receptor surface, generally 
a dendrite.

The preﬁxes pre- and post- refer to the direction 

of synaptic transmission:

1. Presynaptic refers to the transmitting side (usu-

ally axonal).

2. Postsynaptic identiﬁes the receiving side (usually 

dendritic or somatic, sometimes axonal).  

The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are 
separated by a space: the synaptic cleft. A dense mate-
rial coats the inner surface of these membranes: the 
presynaptic and postsynaptic densities. 

Presynaptic terminals contain a large number of 
membrane-bound synaptic vesicles with neurotrans-
mitter contents (40 to 100 nm in diameter) and mi-
tochondria.  They derive from the neuronal soma and 
are transported by molecular motor proteins along

Axon 

The axon arises from the perikaryon in

generation, the trigger zone. Contrary to 
the gradually tapering dendrite, the 
diameter of the axon remains constant 
throughout its length. In myelinated 
axons, a myelin sheath extends from the 
initial segment to the telodendron. Many 
axons have collateral branches.

Dendritic 

spine

Soma or cell body

Lysosome

The cell body or soma contains the nucleus and the surrounding cytoplasm or perikaryon. The 
soma, the trophic center of the neuron, contains organelles for the synthesis of proteins, 
phospholipids, and other macromolecules. A characteristic feature of the perikaryon is the 
abundance of ribosomes, free or associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. In light 
microscopic preparations with nucleic acid stains (basophilia), these structures appear as large 
clumps or Nissl bodies. A prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous mitochondria also reside 
in the perikaryon. Neurotubules and neurofilaments are distinctive features of the perikaryon. 
These cytoskeletal components extend through the perikaryon into the dendritic and axonal 
processes. Lysosomes and yellowish-pigmented lipofuscin granules are also present. The 
nucleus is usually large, with dispersed chromatin (euchromatin) and one or more prominent 
nucleoli.

We emphasize once more the bidirectional trans-
port  of  cargos  (including  synaptic  vesicles  and 
mitochondria) along the axon: 

1. Kinesin-mediated anterograde axonal transport 
of neurotransmitters, from the cell body toward the 
axon terminal and the plus end of microtubules.

 Box 8-E  |  Cerebral cortex

  

•  The cerebral cortex, or pallium (Greek, pallium, shell), has a laminar (layered) 
and columnar organization that varies from one region to another. Cortex map-
ping permits to determine the histologic variations of different areas. The map of 
Broadmann divides the cortex into 47 areas.
•  The laminar organization of neurons varies throughout the cortex. Three 
cellular laminae are observed in the paleocortex of the uncus (olfaction) and 
archicortex of the hyppocampus in the temporal lobe (memory). Six laminae 
are seen in the neocortex (neopallium) extending 90% of the brain. They are 
listed in Figure 8-5.
•  In the columnar organization, neurons extend radially through all laminae. 
Cell columns, consisting of hundreds of neurons, represent the functional units 
or modules of the cortex.
• The main cell types are pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and smooth 
stellate cells. Bipolar cells are found in the external laminae or layers.

2.  Cytoplasmic  dynein-mediated  retrograde 
axonal transport of growth factors and recycling of 
axon terminal components from the axon terminal 
to the cell body and the minus end of microtubules 
(see Box 8-F). 

As you recall, kinesin and dynein motor proteins 
have a globular motor domain in their heavy subunits 
that bind to microtubules and hydrolyses adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to propel cargos along the mi-
crotubule tracks. Cargos are attached to kinesin by 
the light subunit of the motor protein. Dynactin is 
a protein complex involved in the attachment of the 
cargo to dynein.

There are two types of axonal transport:
1. Fast axonal transport, responsible for the move-

ment of vesicles and mitochondria.

2. Slow axonal transport, which is responsible for 
driving cytoplasmic proteins and cytoskeletal proteins 
for the assembly of microtubules and neuroﬁlaments.
Axonal transport is important in the pathogenesis 
of  neurologic  infectious  diseases.  For  example,  the 
rabies virus introduced by the bite of a rabid animal

Pseudounipolar neuron

A single axon divides a short 
distance from the cell body. 
   The short axon of 
pseudounipolar neurons (or 
unipolar) divides into two 
branches: The peripheral 
branch carries information 
from the periphery. The 
central branch ends in the 
spinal cord. 
   These cells are found in 
sensory ganglia of cranial 
and spinal nerves.

The cerebellum consists of two

separating folia. The tonsils are an 
important feature of the posterior lobe. They 
seat above the foramen magnum of the 
skull. A brain tumor, causing an increase in 
intracranial pressure, may determine one or 
both tonsils to descend into the foramen 
and compress the medulla oblongata.

       Neuronal chemical messengers (acetylcholine, glutamate, 
1
(cid:97)-aminobutyric acid [GABA], and others) are stored in synaptic 
vesicles and transported to the synaptic terminal by anterograde 
transport (kinesin-mediated).
       The membrane of a synaptic vesicle contains vesicular 
2
docking proteins that attach to membrane docking proteins of 
the presynaptic membrane (rich in synapsin filaments).

voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel. A surge of Ca2+ induces 
exocytosis of the synaptic vesicle.  
       The released chemical messenger in the synaptic cleft binds 
4
to a receptor (cholinergic or adrenergic) on the postsynaptic 
membrane to transmit information. 
    The chemical messenger is enzymatically degraded in the cleft 
(acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase) or        taken up by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis (norepinephrine) and degraded by 
the mitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO).

replicates in the muscle tissue from as little as 2 to 
16 weeks or longer. 

After binding to the acetylcholine receptor, the 
viral  particles  are  mobilized  by  retrograde  axonal 
transport to the cell body of neurons supplying the 
affected muscle. 

The rabies virus continues to replicate within in-
fected neurons and after the shedding of the virions 
by budding, they are internalized by the terminals of 
adjacent neurons. 

Further dissemination of the rabies virus occurs 
in  the  CNS.  From  the  CNS,  the  rabies  virus  is 
transported by anterograde axonal transport by the 
peripheral  nerves  to  the  salivary  glands. The  virus 
enters the saliva to be transmitted by the bite. 

Painful spasm of the throat muscles on swallowing  
accounts  for  hydrophobia  (aversion  to  swallowing 
water).

The  retrograde  axonal  transport  to  the  CNS  of 
tetanus toxin, a protease produced by the vegetative 
spore form of Clostridium tetani bacteria after enter-
ing at a wound site, blocks the release of inhibitory 
mediators at spinal synapses. Spasm contraction of 

the  jaw  muscles  (known  as  trismus),  exaggerated 
reﬂexes,  and  respiratory  failure  are  characteristic 
clinical ﬁndings.

Glia: The “connective tissue” of the CNS
Glial cells (Greek glia, glue) are more numerous than 
neurons and retain the capacity to proliferate.  Most 
brain tumors, benign or malignant, are of glial origin. 
When  the  CNS  is  injured,  glial  cells  mobilize, 
clean up the debris, and seal off the local area, leaving 
behind a “glial scar” (gliosis), which interferes with 
neuronal regeneration. 

Glial cells include:
1. Astrocytes, derived from the neuroectoderm.
2. Oligodendrocytes, derived from the neuroec-

toderm.

3. Microglia, derived from the mesoderm.
Unlike  neurons,  glial  cells  do  not  propagate  ac-
tion potentials and their processes do not receive or 
transmit electrical signals. 

The function of glial cells is to provide neurons 
with structural support and maintain local condi-
tions for neuronal function.

Astrocytes
Astrocytes are observed in the CNS and are divided 
into two categories:

1. Fibrous astrocytes.
2. Protoplasmic astrocytes.  
Fibrous  astrocytes  are  found  predominantly  in 
white matter and have long thin processes with few 
branches. Protoplasmic astrocytes reside predomi-
nantly in gray matter and have shorter processes with 
many  short  branches.  Astrocytic  processes  end  in 
expansions called end-feet (Figure 8-9).  

One  of  the  distinctive  features  of  astrocytes  is 
the  presence  of  a  large  number  of  glial  ﬁlaments 
(glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein, a class of intermediate 
ﬁlament  studied  in  Chapter  1,  Epithelium).  Glial 
ﬁbrillary acidic protein is a valuable marker for the 
identiﬁcation of astrocytes by immunohistochemis-
try.  Nuclei of astrocytes are large, ovoid, and lightly 
stained. 

 Box 8-F  |  Neurotransmitters

•  Incoming nerve impulses produce focal changes in the resting membrane 
potential of the neuron that spread along the membrane of dendrites and 
soma. 
   Information is conducted along the processes as an electrical excitation 
(depolarization) generated across the cell membrane. 
•  As the resting membrane potential diminishes, a threshold level is reached, 
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open, Ca2+ enters the cell, and at that point, the 
resting potential is reversed: the inside becomes positive with respect to the 
outside. 
•  In response to this reversal, the Na+ channel closes and remains closed for 
the next 1 to 2 msec (the refractory period). Depolarization also causes the 
opening of K+ channels through which K+ leaves the cell, thus repolarizing the 
membrane. 
•  Neuron-to-neuron contacts or synapses are specialized for one-way transfer 
of excitation. Interneuronal communication occurs at a synaptic junction, the 
specialized communication site between the terminal of an axon of one neuron 
and the dendrite of another. 
•  When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, a chemical messenger 
or neurotransmitter is released to elicit an appropriate response.    

   Most brain capillaries and the inner surface of the 
pia mater are completely surrounded by astrocytic 
end-feet (see Figure 8-9) forming the glia limitans
(also called the glial limiting membrane). The close 
association of astrocytes and brain capillaries suggests 
a role in the regulation of brain metabolism.  

Astrocytes  surround  neurons  and  neuronal  pro-
cesses in areas devoid of myelin sheaths (the inter-
nodal segments) and form the structural matrix for 
the nervous system. 

Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells: Myelinization 
Oligodendrocytes  are  smaller  than  astrocytes  and 
their  nuclei  are  irregular  and  densely  stained. The 
cytoplasm  contains  an  extensive  Golgi  apparatus, 
many mitochondria, and a large number of micro-
tubules. One function of oligodendrocytes is axonal 
myelination.

  Several  processes  of  a  single  oligodendrocytes 
envelop single axons and form a sheathlike covering 
(Figure 8-10). The formation of this sheath is similar 
to that of Schwann cells in peripheral nerves.

 Myelin sheaths extend from the initial segments 
of axons to their terminal branches. The segments 
of  myelin  formed  by  individual  oligodendrocyte 
processes are internodes. The periodic gaps between 
the internodes are the nodes of Ranvier. 

A single oligodendrocyte has many processes and 
may form 40 to 50 internodes. The nodes of Ranvier 
are naked segments of axon between the internodal 
segments  of  myelin. This  region  contains  a  high 
concentration  of  voltage-gated  sodium  channels, 
essential for the saltatory conduction of the action 
potential. During saltatory conduction in the myelin-
ated axons, the action potential “jumps” from one 
node to the next.

During the formation of the myelin sheath, a cyto-
plasmic process of the oligodendrocyte wraps around 
the axon and, after one full turn, the external surface 
of  the  glial  membrane  makes  contact  with  itself,

Types of synapses 

Synapses are classified by their

terminal.
       Axodendritic synapse: An axon 
3
ending on a dendrite.
       Axospinous synapse: An axon 
4
terminal facing a dendritic spine.

A dendritic spine consists of an 
expanded head connected to the 
dendrite shaft by a neck. The dendritic 
shaft contains microtubules. 
   In contrast, the dendritic spine 
cytoskeleton consists of actin filaments 
associated with the postsynaptic 
density. Neurotransmitter receptors and 
ion channels are localized in the 
postsynaptic density.

Axon-dendritic synaptic plasticity 

Cell adhesion molecules are present in at the neuronal axon-dendrite synaptic interface. Not 
only do they link pre- and postsynaptic sites but they also interact with other molecules involved 
in the formation, function, and plasticity of synaptic connections. The dynamic regulation of 
synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie learning and memory functions.
   Postsynaptic ephrin B (EphB), a receptor tyrosine kinase, regulates the activity of 
N-methyl-p-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and induces changes in the morphology of dendritic 
spines. (cid:96)-Catenin and calcium regulate gene expression that also contribute to synaptic 
changes. Neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) interacts with tyrosine kinase receptor B 
(TrkB) and Fyn tyrosine kinase to regulate synaptic plasticity.  N-CAM also modulate the 
(cid:95)-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR), a glutamate 
channel that mediates fast synaptic transmission.

forming the inner mesaxon (Figure 8-11). 

As the oligodendrocyte process continues to spiral 
around the axon, the external surfaces fuse to form 
the ﬁrst intraperiod line. At the same time, the cy-
toplasm is squeezed off from the intracellular space 
(like toothpaste from a tube), and the cytoplasmic 
surfaces fuse to form the ﬁrst dense line. 

Spiraling  continues  until  the  axon  is  invested 
with a number of wrappings. The alternate fusion 
of both the cytoplasmic and external surfaces of the 
membrane results in an interdigitated double spiral 
(see Figure 8-11): 

1. One spiral of intraperiod lines (fused external 

surfaces with remnant extracellular space).

2. One spiral of major dense lines (fused cytoplas-

mic surfaces). 

The dense line terminates when the membrane sur-
faces separate to enclose  the cytoplasm at the surface 
of the sheath (the tongue), and the intraperiod line 
terminates as the tongue turns away from the sheath. 
The incisures of Schmidt-Lanterman are seen in 
longitudinal sections of myelinated nerve ﬁbers in the 
CNS and PNS. They correspond to areas of residual 
cytoplasm preserving the viability of myelin.

lipid-soluble molecules can diffuse across 
endothelial cells.

cells are the main components of the

As the myelin sheath approaches the node of Ran-
vier region, an additional ring of cytoplasm separates 
the cytoplasmic surfaces of the cell membrane. These 
tongues make contact with the axolemma, or surface 
membrane of the axon, in the paranodal region. Ax-
ons branch to form collaterals at a node of Ranvier.
The apposed interdigitating processes of myelina-
ting  Schwann  cells  and  the  incisures  of  Schmidt-
Lanterman are linked by tight junctions. 

They are called autotypic tight junctions because 
they  link  plasma  membranes  of  the  same  cell. 
Heterotypic  tight  junctions  are  seen  between  the 
axolemma (surrounding the axon) and the Schwann 
cell paranodal cytoplasmic loops adjacent to the node 
of Ranvier. 

Tight junctions contain claudins (claudin-1, clau-
din-2, and claudin-5) and zonula occludens (ZO) 
proteins (ZO-1 and ZO-2) (see Figure 8-10). 

Tight junctions:
1. Stabilize newly formed wraps of myelin during 

nerve development.

2. Act as a selective permeability barrier.
3.  Restrict  the  movement  of  lipids  and  proteins 

from speciﬁc membrane domains.

Connexin 32 (Cx32) is found in Schwann cells. 
Cx32  does  not  form  gap  junctions  with  other 
Schwann  cells.  Instead,  Cx32  predominates  in  the 
paranodal  membranes  and  incisures  of  Schmidt-
Lanterman and forms intercellular channels linking 
portions  of  the  same  cell.  Mutations  in  the  Cx32
gene causes X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, 
a demyelinating disorder of the PNS characterized 
by  the  progressive  loss  of  both  motor  and  sensory 
functions of the distal legs (see Box 8-G).

Myelin: Protein and lipid components
Myelin in the CNS and PNS is similar in overall pro-
tein and lipid composition, except that myelin in the 
PNS contains more sphingomyelin and glycoproteins.  
Three proteins are particularly relevant (Figure 8-12): 

1. Myelin basic protein (MBP).
2. Proteolipid protein (PLP).

Myelinization in the CNS and PNS

In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (derived from glioblasts) form 
myelin sheaths around the axons. The pattern of myelinization 
in the CNS is different from that in the PNS.
   1.  The cell body of the oligodendrocytes is not closely 
associated with the myelin sheath as the body of a Schwann 
cell is.
   2.  Each oligodendrocyte provides a myelin sheath to several 
axons.  One Schwann cell forms a myelin sheath around a 
single axon.
   3.  There is no basal lamina associated with the myelin sheath 
in the CNS.
   4.  Myelinated axons in the CNS lack a supporting connective 
tissue, as do nerves in the PNS.
   5.  The inner and outer layers of myelin end in separate loops 
near the node of Ranvier and no cytoplasm of the 
oligodendrocytes is trapped. In Schwann cells, the cytoplasm is 
retained.
   6.  In the CNS, the surface of the node is contacted by 
astrocyte processes. In the PNS, the node is covered by 
Schwann cell processes.

3. Myelin protein zero (MPZ).
MBP  is  a  cytosolic  plasma  membrane–bound 
protein present in both the myelin of the PNS and 
CNS. PLP is a tetraspanin protein found only in the 
myelin of the CNS. PLP plays a signiﬁcant role in 
neural development and is a structural component 
of myelin. A mutation of  the PLP gene and its alter-
natively transcribed DM20 protein causes Pelizaeus-
Merzbacher disease, an X-linked neuropathy of the 
group of leukodystrophies in which affected males 
have a reduction of white matter and a reduction in 
the number of oligodendrocytes. The most common 
characteristics  of  Pelizaeus-Merzbacher  disease  are 
ﬂickering eyes, and physical and mental retardation.  
The predominant protein in myelin of the PNS is 
MPZ, a functional equivalent to PLP in the CNS.  

The  extracellular  domain  of  two  MPZ  proteins 
extends  into  the  extracellular  space  to  establish 
homophilic interaction with a similar pair of MPZ 
molecules on an opposite membrane. The homotet-
rameric structure provides  intermembrane adhesion 
essential for the compactation of myelin (see Figure 
8-13).  The intracellular domain of MPZ participates 
in a signaling cascade that regulates myelinogenesis. 
In  the  CNS,  plasma  membrane–associated  PLPs 
interact with each other and have a similar stabiliz-
ing function. 

Proteins of myelin are strong antigens with a role 
in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis in 
the CNS and Guillain-Barré syndrome in the PNS.
Some axons of the PNS are unmyelinated (see Fig-
ure 8-13). A Schwann cell can accommodate several

plasma membrane–associated proteolipid protein (PLP)

Pathology: Demyelinating diseases
The integrity of myelin, but not the axon, is disturbed 
in demyelinating diseases affecting the survival of 
oligodendrocytes  or  the  integrity  of  the  myelin 
sheath.

Demyelinating diseases can be:
1. Immune-mediated.
2. Inherited.

 Box 8-G  |  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease

   •  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a common and heterogeneous inherited 
disorder affecting the PNS. The disease is most often an autosomal-dominant 
syndrome but is genetically heterogeneous.
•  The most frequent form is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1, a demyelin-
ating polyneuropathy (with reduced nerve conduction velocity) caused by muta-
tions affecting myelin components. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 is an 
axonal polyneuropathy (with normal nerve conduction velocity) determined by 
defects in axonal transport (mutation of a kinesin), membrane trafﬁcking, and 
protein synthesis.
•  Myelin protein zero (MPZ) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily 
with a dual role: the compactation of myelin and cell signaling. Myelin in pa-
tients with mutations in the MZP gene is less compact because of a predomi-
nant defect in the extracellular domain of MZP, which is responsible for holding 
two membranes together.  Mutations in the MZP gene cause the genetic and 
clinical variants of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B and type 2. 
•  A duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene causes 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, the most common type of Charcot-
Marie-Tooth disease.

Immune-mediated demyelinating diseases include 
multiple  sclerosis  and  monophasic  demyelinating 
diseases (for example, optic neuritis).

Multiple  sclerosis  (Figure  8-14)  is  characterized 
by  clinically  recurrent  or  chronically  progressive 
neurologic dysfunction caused by multiple areas of 
demyelination in the CNS, in particular the brain, 
optic nerves, and spinal cord. 

An  immune  and  inﬂammatory  mediated  origin 
of multiple sclerosis is supported by an increase of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid 
(CSF),  and  abnormalities  of T  cell  function. Two 
characteristic  pathologic  ﬁndings  are  the multiple 
sclerosis plaque, a demyelination lesion of the white 
matter, and Creutzfeldt cells, reactive astrocytes  with 
several nuclear fragments.

An inherited demyelination disorder is adrenoleu-
kodystrophy, in which progressive demyelination is 
associated with dysfunction of the adrenal cortex. 
The  X-linked  form  of  this  disease  is  caused  by  a 
mutation of a gene encoding a membrane protein of 
peroxisomes. A defect in this gene leads to the ac-
cumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) 
in serum (discussed under Peroxisomes in Chapter 2, 
Epithelial Glands).

Metabolic demyelination disorders include central 
pontine myelinolysis, a syndrome in which neuro-
logic  dysfunction  is  observed  following  rapid  cor-

Figure 8-13. Development of unmyelinated nerves

Unmyelinated nerve fibers

Some axons are unmyelinated. Each Schwann cell is able to house a 
number of axons occupying individual invaginations of its cytoplasm. 
   With such an arrangement, the Schwann cell cannot wrap around 
individual axons and no myelin is produced.
   The entire axolemma of such axons is freely exposed  to the 
interstitial tissue, and axons are partially protected by a basal lamina 
surrounding the supportive Schwann cell. 
   Nerve impulses along these axons travel continuously and, 
therefore, less rapidly than saltatory conduction.

Although most axons are completely 

surrounded by Schwann cell cytoplasm, 

others are partially enclosed and 
covered by basal lamina material

is the presence of symmetrical demyelinated lesions

of axons in the CNS (the spinal cord, in particular)

Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder 
characterized by episodes of neurologic 
dysfunction, separated in time, caused by 
lesions of the white matter, separated in space.
   Two characteristic microscopic features are:  
(1) infiltration of inflammatory cells (T cells and 
macrophages) inside and around multiple 
sclerosis plaques; and (2) plaques of astrocytic 
aggregates.
       CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, recruited to

multiple sclerosis lesions, secrete cytokines 
(interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor ligand 
[TNFL], and interferon-(cid:97)).

Pathology: Neurodegenerative diseases
Degenerative processes of speciﬁc groups of neurons 
of  the  brain  cause  movement  disorders,  dementia 
syndromes,  and  autonomic  perturbations.  Neuro-
degenerative diseases include:

1.  Amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS)  (Figure 
8-15),  the  most  common  adult-initiated  motor 
neuron disease,  is characterized by progressive de-
generation of motor neurons, starting with moderate 
weakness in one limb and progressing to severe pa-
ralysis (swallowing and respiratory disorders), leading 
to death in about 3 years. 

The term amyotrophic refers to muscle atrophy. 
Lateral sclerosis refers to the hardness to palpation 

of the lateral columns of the spinal cord. 

Axonal  transport  defects  caused  by  microtubule 
disorganization  and  increased  phosphorylation  of 
neuroﬁlaments  prevent  binding  of  motor  proteins 
for  cargo  transport.  Consequently,  accumulation 
of vesicles, mitochondria and neuroﬁlaments in the 
perikaryon  determines  neuronal  dysfunction  and  
axonal atrophy. 

In a few familial cases, a mutation in the copper-
zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene has been 
reported.  Defective  SOD1  fails  to  activate  several 
kinases involved in kinesin-based mitochondrial axo-
nal transport.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as Lou Gherig,s 
disease) is a severe condition characterized by progressive 
degeneration of motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord.
     Amyotrophic refers to muscle atrophy. Lateral sclerosis refers 
to the hardness to palpation of the lateral columns of the spinal 
cord in autopsy specimens. Lateral sclerosis is caused by an 
increased number of astrocytes (astrocytic gliosis) following the 
degeneration and loss of motor neurons.  
    ALS is a familial motor neuron disease in 5% to 10% of cases. The 
others are assumed to be sporadic. Mutations in the gene encoding 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) account for 20% of the cases of 
familial ALS. The remaining 80% are caused by mutations of other 
genes.  
    SOD1 is an enzyme that requires copper to catalyze the conversion 
of toxic superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. 

Demyelinization

Symmetrical loss of myelinated fibers in a section of spinal 
cord (crossed cerebrospinal tracts) from a patient with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The preparation was stained for 
myelin.

The effects of mutant SOD1 result in the disorganization of 
neurofilaments filaments (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H; see Figure 8-4). 
In addition, defective SOD1 fails to activate several kinases 
involved in the kinesin-based mitochondrial axonal transport. In 
addition, axonal transport defects, caused by microtubule 
disorganization and increased phosphorylation of neurofilaments, 
prevent binding of motor proteins for cargo transport. Consequently, 
vesicles, mitochondria and neurofilaments accumulate in the 
perikaryon determining neuronal dysfunction and axonal atrophy. 
    The clinically signs are overactive tendon reflexes, Hoffmann 
sign (digital reflex: flexion of the terminal phalanx of the thumb 
following nipping of the nail), Babinski sign (extension of the great 
toe and abduction of the other toes after plantar stimulation), and 
clonus (Greek klonos, a tumult; muscle contraction and relaxation 
of a muscle in rapid succession).   

 Box 8-H  |  Amyloid deposits

•  The conversion of soluble peptide and proteins into amyloid deposits is asso-
ciated with several disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and type II diabetes. 
• Amyloid-(cid:96) protein is produced by endoproteolysis of the amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), a single-transmembrane, receptor-like protein. This is achieved 
by the sequential cleavage of APP by enzyme complexes designated (cid:95)-, (cid:96)- and 
(cid:97)-secretases (see Figure 8-16). 
• Three enzymes with (cid:95)-secretase activity are ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17 
(also known as tumor necrosis factor converting enzyme). In Chapter I, Epithe-
lium, we discuss the structure and function of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase family enzyme).
• The (cid:97)-secretase consists of a complex of enzymes composed of presenilin 1 or 
2, nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective and presenilin enhancer 2. 
• Secretases and ADAMs are sheddases. They are involved in regulated 
intramembrane proteolysis: membrane proteins ﬁrst shed their ectodomains 
by membrane-anchored proteases (sheddases), releasing the extracellular 
domains. Then, the membrane-retained fragment can be cleaved within the 
transmembrane domains to release hydrophobic peptides (such as amyloid-(cid:96)) 
into the extracellular space.  (cid:95)-Secretase (consisting of members of the ADAM 
family) or (cid:96)-secretase (also called (cid:96)-site APP-cleaving enzyme, BACE, see 
Figure 8-16) are involved in ectodomain shedding of APP.

generative disease, is a progressive cortical dementia 
affecting  language,  memory,  and  vision,  as  well  as 
emotion or personality. 

The predominant lesions are:
1. The accumulation of plaques in the extracellular 
space consisting of amyloid (Greek amylon, starch; 
eidos, resemblance) ﬁbrils containing (cid:96)-amyloid (A(cid:96)) 
peptide. Amyloid ﬁbrils have a predominant (cid:96)-sheet 
structure  forming  unfolded  or  partially  unfolded 
conformations of proteins and peptides (Figure 8-16). 
Historically, amyloidosis was observed in the mid-
19th century as iodide or Congo red–stained deposits 
in  organs of patients who died from this condition. 
Amyloid ﬁbrils represent the  loss of function of 
normally soluble, functional peptide and proteins as 
well as the self-assembly of toxic intermediates. 

Keep  in  mind  that  the  protective  mechanisms 
against amyloid formation include the housekeeping 
ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagy systems, which 
prevent the formation and accumulation of misfolded 
and aggregated polypeptide chains.

phagocytosis). 
    Microglia-mediated neurotoxicity 
takes place when pathogen- 
associated molecular patterns

excessive immune response. A given 
ligand can be recognized by several 
PRRs (cumulative effect).
   Ligands include amyloid-(cid:96) peptide

(Parkinson’s disease) and human

Microglial phagocytosis signaling

Removal of dying or dead neurons by apoptosis or necrosis during 
development, inflammation, and neuropathologic conditions 
involve the phagocytic activity of microglial cells, the resident 
macrophages of the brain and spinal cord. 
   Microglial cells sense phagocytosis recognition signals, such as 
phospholipid phosphatidylserine translocated by phosphatidylserine 
translocases from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the 

cell surface. Phosphatidylserine marks stressed, dying or dead 
neurons for removal, thus enabling microglial receptors and 
opsonins to engulf whole dead neurons or parts of stressed neurons 
within hours.
   Microgliosis is the massive microglial response to tissue damage 
that can be reparative or destructive (called reactive microgliosis).

 Plaques and tangles lead to neuronal and white

and highlight the major molecular events observed 
in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, in 
particular the formation of amyloid plaques. A dis-

accumulation of A(cid:96) peptides may be the initiation 
factor in Alzheimer’s disease.

Alterations  in  the  stabilizing  function  of  tau,  a 
microtubule-associated protein, result in the accumu-
lation of  twisted pairs of tau in neurons. In normal 
neurons,  soluble  tau  promotes  the  assembly  and 
stability of microtubules and axonal vesicle transport. 
Hyperphosphorylated tau is insoluble, lacks afﬁnity 
for microtubules, and self-associates into paired heli-
cal ﬁlaments (see Figure 8-16).

deposits of hyperphosphorylated (cid:95)-synuclein in the 
cytoplasm of neurons (Lewy bodies) and threadlike 
inclusions in axons (Lewy neurites).  

Mutations in the SNCA  gene, encoding (cid:95)-synucle-
in, causes familial autosomal dominant Parkinson’s 
disease. Permanent phosphorylation of (cid:95)-synuclein 
slows down axonal transport. 

Another gene associated with a familial form of 
Parkinson’s  disease  is  PARK2  (Parkinson’s  disease 
protein 2). PARK2 encodes the E3 ubiquitin-protein 
ligase parkin. Parkin is involved in the maintenance 
of mitochondria. Defective mitochondria can trigger 
the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
disrupt cell functions. 

How does parkin work? Mitophagy is a speciﬁc 
mechanism to eliminate damaged mitochondria by 
a signaling pathway involving two enzymes: PINK1 
(PTEN [phosphatase and tensin homolog] induced 
putative kinase 1) and parkin.  

Cytoplasmic parkin is inactive when mitochondria 
are functioning normally, whereas PINK1 is associ-
ated  with  mitochondria.   When  mitochondria  are 
damaged,  parkin  links  to  the  outer  mitochondrial 
membrane  and  its  ubiquitin  ligase  activity  is  un-
leashed by PINK1. Activated parkin transfers ubiq-
uitin proteins to proteins bound to the outer mito-
chondrial membrane to initiate mitophagy, a control 
process preventing mitochondrial dysfunction.

As we discuss in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling, ubiqui-

tin ligases attach ubiquitin protein chains to proteins, 
a  process  called  ubiquitination,  thereby  targeting 
them for degradation by the 26S proteasome.

An impairment in axonal transport, determined by 
hyperphosphorylated (cid:95)-synuclein, and the accumula-
tion of damaged mitochondria, caused by mutations 
in  parkin and PINK1, determine high mitochondrial 
oxidative stress in dopamine neurons, the initial step 
of the familial forms of Parkinson’s  disease.   

4. Huntington’s disease is an inherited adult-onset 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle 
incoordination,  cognitive  decline,  and  dementia.  
Huntington’s disease and spinal and bulbar muscular 
atrophy (SBMA; also known as Kennedy disease) be-
long to the group of polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. 
Selected genes are enriched in CAG repeats in the 
coding region of neuronal genes. SBMA, a male neu-
rodegenerative  disease  characterized  by  progressive 
motor neuron degeneration and bulbar defects (dys-
arthria [speech disorder] and dysphagia), is caused by 
a polyQ expansion in the androgen receptor protein.  
Huntington’s disease is caused by a the gene hun-
tingtin (HTT) containing a number of CAG repeats 
in  the  coding  region  and  expressing  polyQ  HTT 
protein.  Huntington’s disease was brieﬂy discussed 
in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling, within the context of 
apoptosis involving caspases and cytochrome c. 

Aggregates of polyQ HTT disrupt axonal transport

plexuses produce about 80% to 
90% of the CSF. The remaining 
portion originates in the nervous 
tissue (extracellular fluid).  

Brain metastasis: co-opting 

blood vessels

Brain metastasis are generally 
perivascular. Metastatic tumor cells 
produce neuroserpin, which blocks 
plasmin produced by astrocytes from 
plasminogen secreted by neurons. 
Plasmin protects the brain from 
metastasis by promoting apoptosis 
of tumor cells. Astrocytes produce 
Fas ligand, an apoptosis inducer.

The arachnoid–CSF barrier

The arachnoid membrane prevents the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid 
space from coming in contact with the fluid of 
the extracellular space of the dura mater. CSF 
drains around the cerebral hemispheres to the 
arachnoid villi placed along the venous sinus.

The blood-brain barrier

The tight junctions of the brain

the structural component of the

    Astrocytic end-feet, in contact with

nature of the barrier. However,

The CSF circulates through the ventricles and the 
subarachnoid space around the central nervous sytsem 
(CNS).  CSF enters the arachnoid space containing 
arachnoid villi, protrusions of the arachnoid into the 
lumen of the venous sinus, and permeates between or 
through the endothelial cells lining the venous sinus. 
    CSF is separated from the blood by the endothelial cell 
lining of the venous sinus. Blood does not flow from the 
venous sinus to the subarachnoid space. A blockage of the 
movement of CSF results in its accumulation in the ventricles 
and around the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus.

acetylation, a reversible post-translational modiﬁca-
tion of (cid:95)-tubulin, is required for the binding of motor 
protein-cargo complexes to axonal microtubules. 

Microglial cells 
Microglia comprise about 12% of cells in the brain. 
They predominate in the gray matter, with higher 

concentrations  in  the  hippocampus,  olfactory  tel-
encephalon,  basal  ganglia,  and  substantia  nigra. 
Microglial cells exist in a resting state characterized 
by a branching cytoplasmic morphology. In response 
to brain injury or immunologic activity, microglial 
cells change into an activated state characterized by 
an ameboidal morphology accompanied by the up-

Organization of a peripheral nerve

The nerve fiber is the main structural component of a peripheral 
nerve and consists of an axon, myelin sheath, and Schwann 
cells.
   Nerve fibers are grouped into fascicles by connective tissue 
sheaths. A fascicle contains myelinated and unmyelinated nerve 
fibers.
   Axons contain segments of myelin (internodes) separated by 

nodes of Ranvier. A single Schwann cell provides the myelin 
sheath for each internode.
   The thickness of the myelin sheath is proportional to the 
diameter of the axon. The wider the axon, the longer the 
internode distance.
   Neuroepithelial cells of the perineurium are joined by tight 
junctions forming the blood-nerve barrier. Endoneurial 
capillaries are lined by continuous endothelial cells linked by 
tight junctions to contribute to the blood-nerve barrier.

regulation of cell surface molecules, such as CD14, 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recptors 
and chemokine receptors.

Activated  microglial  cells  participate  in  brain 
development by supporting the clearance of neural 
cells undergoing apoptosis, eliminating toxic debris 
and enhancing neuronal survival through the release 
of  trophic  and  anti-inﬂammatory  factors.  In  the 
mature brain, microglia facilitate repair by steering 
the migration of stem cells to the site of inﬂamma-
tion and injury.  

exert neurotoxic effects by the excessive production 
of cytotoxic substances such as ROS, nitric oxide, and 
tumor  necrosis  factor  ligand.  Activated  microglial 
cells are present in large numbers in neurodegenera-
tive diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,  
multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Hun-
tington’s  disease),  causing  a  generalized  microglial 
hyperactivity, a condition called reactive microgliosis. 
Figure 8-17 provides a summary of the structural 
and functional aspects of resting, activated and hy-
peractivated microglial cells.

and  oligodendrocytes  is  difﬁcult  in  routine  histo-
logic  techniques.  Immunocytochemical  and  silver 
impregnation procedures are commonly used for the 
identiﬁcation of glial cells.

Ependyma
Ependyma designates the simple cuboidal epithelium  
covering the surface of the ventricles of the brain and 
the central canal of the spinal cord. The ependyma 
consists of two cell types (Figure 8-18): 

1. Ependymal cells.
2. Tanycytes.
Ependymal cells form a simple cuboidal epithe-
lium, lining the ventricular cavities of the brain and 
the central canal of the spinal cord. These cells dif-
ferentiate from germinal or ventricular cells of the 
embryonic neural tube. 

The  apical  domain  of  ependymal  cells  contains 
abundant  microvilli  and  one  or  more  cilia.  Des-
mosomes link adjacent ependymal cells. The basal 
domain is in contact with astrocytic processes.

Tanycytes  are  specialized  ependymal  cells  with 
basal  processes  extending  between  the  astrocytic 
processes to form an end-foot on blood vessels.

Choroid plexus 
The  choroid  plexus  produces  cerebrospinal  ﬂuid 
(CSF).  During  development,  the  ependymal  cell 
layer comes in contact with the highly vascularized 
pia mater, forming the tela choroidea in the roof of 
the third and fourth ventricles and along the choroid 
ﬁssure of the lateral ventricles. These cells differenti-
ate into secretory cells, which in combination with 
the meningeal blood vessels form the choroid plexus 
(see Figure 8-18).

The cells of the choroid plexus are highly polarized 
(Figure 8-19). The apical domain contains micro-
villi, and tight junctions connect adjacent cells. The 
basolateral domain forms interdigitating folds, and 
the cell rests on a basal lamina. 

Capillaries  with  fenestrated  endothelial  cells  are 
located beneath the basal lamina. Macromolecules of 
the blood plasma can pass freely into the subepithelial 
space;  however,  they  cannot  pass  directly  into  the 
CSF because of the elaborate interdigitations along 
the basolateral domain and the apical tight junctions.

Cerebrospinal ﬂuid  
The choroid plexuses of the lateral, third, and 
fourth ventricles produce about 300 mL of CSF 
every 24 hs. 
CSF  ﬂows  from  the  lateral  ventricles  of  the  brain 
into  the  third  ventricle  through  the  interventricu-
lar  foramen.  CSF  descends  to  the  fourth  ventricle 
through    the  aqueduct  and  reaches  the  brain  and 
spinal  subarachnoid  space  through  median  and 

lateral apertures. Some of the CSF descends through 
the foramen magnum, reaching the lumbar cistern 
in about 12 hs.

After entering the subarachnoid space, CSF ﬂows 
outside the CNS into the blood, at the superior sagit-
tal sinus (see Figure 8-20). CSF is transported across 
the arachnoid epithelium in large vacuoles. 

The epithelium of the choroid plexus represents a 
barrier between the blood and the CSF. Several  sub-
stances can leave the capillaries of the choroid plexus 
but cannot enter the CSF.  

CSF  protects  and  supports  the  brain  and  spinal 
cord  from  external  forces  applied  to  the  skull  or 
vertebral column (cushioning effect). 

In addition, the CSF allows the removal of meta-
bolic wastes by continual drainage of the ventricular 
cavities  and  subarachnoid  space. The  volume  of  
CSF varies with the intracranial blood volume. The 
free communication of CSF among compartments 
protects against pressure differences.

Lumbar  puncture  is  a  procedure  to  collect  a 
sample of CSF for biochemical analysis and pressure 
measurement. CSF is collected with a needle inserted 
obliquely  through the interspinous ligament between 
the third and fourth (L3 and L4) and fourth and ﬁfth 
(L4 and L5) lumbar vertebrae. The total volume of 
CSF in an adult is about 120 mL.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Brain permeability barriers
The brain is supplied with blood from major arteries 
forming an anastomotic network around the base of 
the brain.  From this region, arteries project into the 
subarachnoid space before entering the brain tissue. 
In the brain, the perivascular space is surrounded by 
a basal lamina derived from both glial and endothelial 
cells: the glia limitans. Nonfenestrated endothelial 
cells, linked by tight  junctions, prevent the diffusion 
of substances from the blood to the brain. 

Tight  junctions  represent  the  structural  basis 
of  the  blood-brain  barrier. This  barrier  offers  free 
passage to glucose and other selected molecules but 
excludes most substances, in particular potent drugs 
required for the treatment of an infection or tumor.  
If the blood-brain barrier breaks down, tissue ﬂuid 
accumulates in the nervous tissue, a condition known 
as cerebral edema.

External to the capillary endothelial cell lining is a 
basal lamina and external to this lamina are the end-
feet of the astrocytes. 

Although  the  pericapillary  end-feet  of  astrocytes 
are  not  part  of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  they  con-
tribute to its maintenance by transporting ﬂuid and 
ions from the perineuronal extracellular space to the 
blood vessels. 

Figure  8-20  illustrates  details  of  the  three  brain 

permeability barriers:

An intact motor neuron is shown with 
an axon ending in a neuromuscular

    The soma of the neuron contains 
abundant Nissl bodies (aggregates 
of ribosomes attached to the 
endoplasmic reticulum and free 
polyribosomes).

            An injury damages the nerve

division and bridge the gap between

segments of the axon degenerate 
(anterograde and retrograde

generates multiple sprouts 
advancing between Schwann cells. 
One sprout persists and grows 
distally (~1.5 mm per day) to 
reinnervate the muscle. The 
remaining sprouts degenerate.
   In the CNS, degeneration of the 
axon and myelin is similar and 
microglial cells remove debris by 
phagocytosis.
    The regeneration process 
starts but is aborted by the 
absence of endoneurium and 
lack of proliferation of 
oligodendrocytes.

        Once the regenerated axon

reaches the end organ (several 
months), Schwann cells start the 
production of myelin. The 
internodal segments are shorter.
   The regenerated axon has a 
reduced diameter (80% of the 
original diameter) and, therefore, 
the conduction velocity of the 
nerve impulse is slower.

1. The  arachnoid-CSF  barrier,  represented  by 
arachnoid villi or granulations distributed along the 
venous sinus, in particular the arachnoid barrier cells 
linked by tight junctions. Arachnoid villi  transfer  
CSF to the venous system (superior sagittal sinus). 
Fluid  in  the  subarachnoid  space  operates  like  a 
shock absorber, which prevents the mass of the brain 
from compressing nerve roots and blood vessels. 

2. The blood-CSF barrier, involving tight junc-
tions of the choroidal epithelium, is responsible for 
the production of the CSF. Remember that the tight 
junctions prevent the paracellular transport of sev-
eral  substances leaving the capillaries of the choroid 
plexus but unable to enter the CSF.  

3. The blood-brain barrier, represented by tight 
junctions sealing the endothelial intercellular space.
Obstruction  of  CSF  movement  or  defective 
absorption causes an accumulation of ﬂuid in the 
ventricular spaces and around the brain. 

Hydrocephalus is a pathologic condition charac-
terized by an increase in CSF volume and pressure 
and  enlargement  of  the  ventricular  space  result-
ing  from  obstruction  of  normal  CSF  circulation. 
Obstruction  of  the  foramina  opening  the  fourth 
ventricle  to the subarachnoid space is, in most cases, 
the determinant of hydrocephalus. 

The  blood-brain  barrier  is  an  obstacle  for  the 
metastasis of cancerous cells. However, metastases 
to  the  brain  are  generally  in  a  perivascular  loca-
tion,  a  condition  known  as  vascular  co-option  of 
pre-existing  vasculature.  Metastasis  develops  and 
progresses in the absence of angiogenesis.

 Metastatic tumor cells produce the protein neu-
roserpin.  Neuroserpin  blocks  plasmin,  a    protein 
derived from the cleavage of plasminogen produced 
by neurons. Plasmin inhibits spreading of malignant 
cells along the perivascular space of the brain by trig-
gering the apoptosis of cancer cells. 

Astrocytes produce Fas ligand (FasL), as you re-
member is an apoptosis inducer, and plasminogen

|  Neurotrophins

   • Neurons depend on peripheral structures for their survival. Speciﬁc factors, 

called neurotrophins, are produced by target organs, internalized by nerve 
endings and transported back to the neuronal soma. Neurotrophins are neces-
sary for the survival of neurons produced in excess during early development, 
for the growth of their axons and dendrites and for the synthesis of neurotrans-
mitters. Neurotrophins prevent the programmed cell death or apoptosis of 
neurons.
• Neurotrophins include: nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and NT-4/5.  
• Neurotrophins bind to two speciﬁc cell surface receptors: neurotrophin 
receptor p75 (~75 kd) and tropomyosin receptor kinase (~140 kd; TrkA, B and 
C). NGF binds preferentially to TrkA. BDNF and NT-4/5 bind to TrkB. NT3 is a 
ligand for TrkC.  
• Neurotrophin signaling activates or represses gene expression.

activator,  that  cleaves  neuronal  plasminogen  into 
soluble plasmin. In fact, plasmin cleaves FasL, bound 
to the plasma membrane of astrocytes, into soluble 
FasL to initiate apoptosis. 

The high levels of neuroserpin produced by tumor 
cells prevent the formation of plasmin and soluble 
FasL. Consequently, metastatic tumor cells retain the  
expression  of  the  cell  adhesion  molecule  L1CAM, 
essential for vascular co-option.

 

Peripheral nervous system
The PNS includes all neuronal elements outside the 
brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nerves are the 
cranial and spinal nerves.

The PNS contains two supporting cell types: 
1. Schwann cells, analogous to the oligodendro-

cytes of the CNS.

2. Satellite cells, Schwann cell–like surrounding 
the cell bodies of neurons in sensory and autonomic 
ganglia. We discuss them later.

Individual nerve ﬁbers of the PNS are ensheathed 
by Schwann cells (Figure 8-21). In myelinated ﬁbers, 
individual  Schwann  cells  wrap  around  the  axon, 
forming  a  myelin  sheath  analogous  to  that  of  the 
oligodendrocytes of the CNS (see Figure 8-11). In 
unmyelinated ﬁbers, a single Schwann cell envelops 
several axons (see Figure 8-13). 

There  are  two  important  differences  between 

Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes: 

1. A single Schwann cell forms only one internodal 
segment of myelin, whereas a single oligodendrocyte 
may form 40 or 50 internodes.

2. Unmyelinated ﬁbers in the PNS are embedded 
in Schwann cells, whereas those in the CNS are not 
ensheathed  by  oligodendrocytes  but  may  have  an 
investment of astrocytes.

Structure of a peripheral nerve 
Connective  tissue  coverings  divide  the  peripheral 
nerve into three segments, each with unique struc-
tural characteristics (see Figures 8-21 and 8-22): 

1. The epineurium.
2. The perineurium.
3. The endoneurium. 
The epineurium is formed by type I collagen and 
ﬁbroblasts and covers the entire nerve. It contains 
arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels.

Within the nerve, the perineurium segregates ax-
ons into fascicles. The perineurium consists of several 
concentric layers of neuroepithelial perineurial cells 
with two distinct characteristics:

1.  A basal lamina, consisting of type IV collagen 
and laminin, surrounds the layers of perineurial cells.
2. Perineurial cells are joined to each other by tight 
junctions to form a protective diffusion barrier: the 
blood-nerve barrier, responsible for maintaining the

neuron bifurcates, sending one centrifugal process into a ramus of the 
spinal nerve and the other, centripetal process, into the spinal cord.
    Fascicles of nerve fibers are myelinated and run between the 
neurons. Each neuron is surrounded by satellite cells (Schwann 
cell-like cells) associated with a basal lamina. Fibroblasts and collagen 
fibers beyond the basal lamina aggregate to form a capsule.

The sympathetic (autonomic) ganglion

The neurons of the ganglion tend to be

their axons are mostly unmyelinated.

cells (Schwann cell–like cells) less 
numerous than those of spinal ganglia.

physiologic microenvironment of the endoneurium. 
The endoneurium surrounds individual axons and 
their associated Schwann cells and myelin sheaths. It 
consists of type III collagen ﬁbrils, a few ﬁbroblasts, 
macrophages, mast cells and endoneurial capillaries 
between individual the axons lor nerve ﬁbers. 

Multiple  unmyelinated  axons are  individually 
encased within recesses of the cytoplasm of Schwann 
cells. As you remember, unmyelinated axons do not 
undergo the spiral concentric lamination and myelin 
formation. For future reference in neuropathology, 
keep in mind the Luxol fast blue staining method  
widely used for myelin staining. 

Additional components of the blood-nerve barrier 
are  the  endothelial  cells  of  the  endoneurial  capil-
laries. Endoneurial capillaries derive from the vasa 
nervorum and are lined by continuous endothelial 
cells joined by tight junctions.

Pathology: Schwannomas
Schwannomas  are  benign  encapsulated  tumors 
consisting  of  Schwann  cells.  Keep  in  mind  that 
Schwann cells are present in all peripheral nerves. 
Therefore, schwannomas can be found in many sites 
(intracranial, intraspinal and extraspinal locations).
Schwannomas can develop at the surface or inside 
of a nerve fascicle and display spindle cells (called 
Antoni A pattern) or multipolar cells (called Antoni 
B pattern), the latter representing the result of a de-
generative process. All schwannomas are immunore-
active for S-100 protein (a calmodulin-like cytosolic 
protein present in cells derived from the neural crest), 
type IV collagen and laminin. Schwannomas need 
to be distinguished from neuroﬁbromas, that may 
contain Schwann cells.

Pathology:  Segmental  demyelination  and  axonal 
degeneration
Diseases  affecting  Schwann  cells  lead  to  a  loss  of 
myelin,  or  segmental  demyelination.  Damage  to 
the neuron and its axon leads to axonal degenera-
tion (wallerian degeneration, ﬁrst described by the 
English physiologist Augustus Volney Waller, 1816-
1870). 

Axonal  degeneration  (Figure  8-23)  may  be  fol-
lowed by axonal regeneration. Recall from our dis-
cussion in Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue, that the motor 
unit  is  the  functional  unit  of    the  neuromuscular 
system.   Therefore,  segmental  demyelination  and 
axonal degeneration affect the motor unit and cause 
muscle  paralysis  and  atrophy.  Physiotherapy  for 
the paralyzed muscles is necessary to prevent muscle 
degeneration  before  regenerating  motor  axons  can 
reach the motor unit. 

Neurotrophins play a signiﬁcant role in the sur-
vival of neurons uncoupled from a peripheral target 
(see Box 8-I).

Segmental demyelination occurs when the func-
tion of the Schwann cell is abnormal or there is dam-
age to the myelin sheath, for example, a traumatic 
nerve injury.  If the nerve ﬁber is completely severed, 
the chances of recovery decrease unless a nerve seg-
ment is grafted. 

The presence of the endoneurium is essential for 
the  proliferation  of  Schwann  cells.  Schwann  cells 
guide an axonal sprout, derived from the proximal 
axonal stump, to reach the end organ (for example, 
a muscle).  

Several sprouts can grow into the connective tissue 
and, together with proliferative Schwann cells, form a 
mass called an traumatic neuroma (see Figure 8-23). 
Traumatic neuromas prevent regrowth of the axon 
after trauma and must be surgically removed to allow 
reinnervation of the peripheral end organ.

Axonal regeneration is a very slow process. It starts 
2 weeks after injury and is completed, if successful, 
after several months. Schwann cells remyelinate the 
denuded portion of the axon, but the length of in-
ternodal myelin is shorter.  

Axonal degeneration results from the primary de-
struction of the axon by  metabolic or toxic damage 
and is followed by demyelination and degeneration 
of the neuronal cell body. This process is known as a 
“dying back” neuropathy.

Regeneration  of  nerve  ﬁbers  in  the  CNS  is  not 
possible at present because of the following factors: 

1. An endoneurium is not present. 
2. Oligodendrocytes do not proliferate in contrast 
to Schwann cells, and a single oligodendrocyte serves 
a large number of axons.

3.  Astrocytes  deposit  scar  tissue  (the  astrocytic 

plaque).

Sensory (spinal) ganglia
A cluster of neurons forms a ganglion (plural ganglia). 
A ganglion can be sensory (dorsal root ganglia and 
trigeminal ganglion) or motor (visceromotor or au-
tonomic ganglia). Axons derived from a ganglion are 
organized as nerves, rami (singular ramus), or roots.
Sensory  ganglia  of  the  posterior  spinal  nerve  
roots and the trunks of the trigeminal, facial, glos-
sopharyngeal, and vagal cranial nerves have a similar 
organization (Figure 8-24; see Figure 8-15).

A  connective  tissue  capsule,  representing  the 
continuation  of  the  epineurium  and  perineurium, 
surrounds each ganglion. 

Neurons are pseudounipolar, with a single stem 
myelinated process leaving each cell body. The short 
process bifurcates into a peripheral centrifugal branch 
into one ramus of the spinal nerve and a centripetal 
branch into the spinal cord. 

The neuronal cell body is surrounded by a layer of 
ﬂattened satellite cells, similar to Schwann cells and 
continuous with them as they enclose the peripheral

Adrenergic neurons (induced fluorescence)

and central process of each neuron. 

Following  stimulation  of  the  peripheral  sensory 
receptor,  nerve impulse reach the T-bifurcation junc-
tion bypassing the neuronal cell body, traveling from 
the peripheral axon to the centripetal axon.

Autonomic nervous system: Ganglia and plexuses
The main divisions of the autonomic (self-regulating)
nervous system (ANS) are:

1. The sympathetic nervous system.
2. The parasympathetic nervous system.
3. The regional autonomic innervation of the heart, 
enteric nervous system, lower-level bladder controls 
and the functional innervation of the genital tract.

The controlling neuronal centers, residing in the 
hypothalamus and brainstem, send ﬁbers to synapse   
on preganglionic neurons located in the gray matter 
of the brainstem and spinal cord.

268

8. NERVOUS TISSUE

Autonomic nervous system

Neurons of the ANS derive from the neural crest 
and are situated in ganglia (a clustering of neurons 
acting as a transfer site for neuron stimulation), out-
side the CNS. The ANS consists of elements of the 
CNS and PNS; the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
divisions contain ganglia.

Preganglionic neurons, located in the lateral gray 
horn of the spinal cord at thoracic and upper lum-
bar  segments  levels,  extend  preganglionic  ﬁbers, 
mostly myelinated, into the corresponding anterior 
nerve roots and enter the autonomic ganglia of the 
paravertebral sympathetic chain, outside the CNS. 

Some of the preganglionic ﬁbers:
1. Synapse  within the nearest ganglion and un-
myelinated postganglionic ﬁbers enter spinal nerves 
of the thoracolumbar region to supply blood vessels 
and sweat glands in the supply area.

2. Some preganglionic ﬁbers ascend the sympathetic 
chain and synapse in the superior or middle cervical 
ganglion or in the stellate ganglion (consisting in the 
fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and the ﬁrst 
thoracic  ganglion).  Unmyelinated  postganglionic 
ﬁbers extend to the head, neck, and upper limbs as 
well as the heart and the dilator  myoepithelial cells 
of the iris. 

Horner  syndrome  (Bernard-Horner  syndrome) 
consists in a constricted pupil (miosis), partial ptosis 
of the eyelid, and loss of hemifacial sweating (hemi-
facial anhidrosis). It is caused by a disruption in the 
structure and function of postganglionic neurons in 
the stellate ganglion.

3. Some preganglionic ﬁbers descend to synapse 
the lumbar or sacral ganglia. Unmyelinated postgan-
glionic ﬁbers  become part of the lumbosacral plexus 
to reach blood vessels of the skin of the lower limbs.
4. Some preganglionic ﬁbers cross the chain and 
exit as preganglionic ﬁbers of the thoracic and lumbar 
splanchnic  nerves. The  thoracic  splanchnic  nerves 
traverse the diaphragm and synapse in the abdominal 
cavity in the celiac and mesenteric prevertebral gan-
glia and renal ganglia. Unmyelinated postganglionic 
ﬁbers reach the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas 
and the kidneys through the aorta and its branches.
 Sensory ﬁbers, detecting pain from viscera, reach 
the CNS by either or both of the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic pathways. Their neurons are located 
in either the spinal ganglion (dorsal root ganglion) or 
the sensory ganglion of several cranial nerves. 

In  the  presence  of  fear,  the  sympathetic  system 
stimulates an increase in the heart rate, dilation of 
the pupils and skin sweating. Blood ﬂow is redirected 
from  the  skin  and  intestinal  tract  to  the  skeletal 
muscle. The sphincters of the urinary and alimentary 
tracts contract.

The parasympathetic system has a counterbalanc-
ing effect of the sympathetic system. It slows down 

the  heart,  stimulates  intestinal  and  digestive  gland 
secretory function and accelerates intestinal peristalsis. 
Preganglionic ﬁbers  exit the CNS from the cranio-
sacral segment levels. Fibers exit from the brainstem 
in four cranial nerves: the oculomotor, facial, glos-
sopharyngeal and vagus and from the sacral segments 
of the spinal cord.

The enteric nervous system consists of two inter-
connected plexuses within the walls of the alimentary 
tube:

1. The myenteric plexus of Auerbach.
2. The submucosal plexus of Meissner. 
Each plexus consists of neurons and associated cells, 
and bundles of nerve ﬁbers passing between plexuses. 
We discuss the enteric nervous system in Chapter 15, 
Upper Digestive Segment, and Chapter 16, Lower 
Digestive Segment.

In summary:
1. Similar to the spinal (sensory) ganglion, sym-
pathetic  ganglia  are  surrounded  by  a  layer  of  con-
nective tissue continuous with the epineurium and 
perineurium of the peripheral nerve ﬁber (see Figures 
8-24 and 8-15). 

2. The  neurons  of  the  sympathetic  ganglia  are 

multipolar neurons. 

3. The dendrites are contacted by myelinated axons 

of preganglionic neurons (white rami). 

4. The axons have a small diameter and are unmy-

elinated (gray rami). 

5.  Each  neuronal  cell  body  is  surrounded  by 
Schwann  cell–like  satellite  cells,  less  abundant  in 
sympathetic  ganglia  when  compared  to  the  more 
abundant satellite cells in dorsal root spinal ganglia. 

Neurohistochemistry
The nervous tissue has specialized features not ob-
served  in  other  basic  tissues  stained  with  routine 
staining  methods  such  as  hematoxylin-eosin.  For 
example, basic dyes can  demonstrate the cytoplasmic 
Nissl substance (ribonucleoproteins) in the cytoplasm 
of neurons (Figure 8-25).

Reduced  silver  methods  produce  dark  deposits 
in various structures of neurons and glial cells. The 
Golgi method is particularly valuable for the study 
of dendrites. A variant of the Golgi method enables 
the identiﬁcation of the cytomembranes and vesicles 
of the Golgi apparatus.

 Myelin stains are based on the use of dyes with 
binding afﬁnity for proteins bound to phospholipids. 
An example is Luxol fast blue. They are useful for the 
identiﬁcation of tracts of ﬁbers. Combined Nissl and 
myelin stains are used in neuropathology.

A tracer, such as horseradish peroxidase, injected 
into a neuron using a micro-pipet, has been used for 
anterograde transport studies. 

Similarly,  tracers  injected  into  nerve  terminals

Essential concepts

Nervous Tissue

• The nervous system consists of:
  (1) The central nervous system (CNS) (brain, 
spinal cord, and the neural parts of the eye).
  (2) The peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
(peripheral ganglia, nerves, nerve endings link-
ing ganglia with the CNS, and receptors and 
effectors of the body). 
  The basic components of the CNS are neu-
rons and glia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and 
microglial cells). 
  The PNS includes Schwann cells (peripheral 
nerves) and satellite cells (ganglia).

• The CNS develops from the primitive ecto-

derm. A neural plate folds to form a hollow 
cylinder, the neural tube (a process known as 
neurulation). 
  A region of the neural tube becomes the 
neural crest, which forms the neurons of 
peripheral ganglia and other components of 
the PNS. In addition, neural crest cells migrate 
along speciﬁc routes and differentiate into me-
lanocytes, smooth muscle, and cartilaginous 
and skeletal components of the head. Some 
cells form the medulla of the adrenal gland; 
others organize the enteric nervous system of 
the alimentary tube.
   Defects in the closing of the neural tube 

cause congenital malformation (for example, 
spina biﬁda, anencephaly, and craniorachis-
chisis).

• The functional unit of the nervous system 
is the neuron. A neuron consists of a body 
(soma or perikaryon), multiple dendrites, 
and a single axon. Dendrites are covered by 
dendritic spines. The site of origin of the axon 
is called the axon hillock. The terminal portion 
of an axon has branches (called collectively 
telodendron); each branch has an enlarged 
synaptic ending or synaptic bouton. The neu-
ronal body contains two important structures: 

270

8. NERVOUS TISSUE

Essential concepts

Nissl body or substance (aggregates of polyri-
bosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum), 
and cytoskeletal components (neuroﬁlaments 
and neurotubules), which extend into the 
dendritic and axonal processes. Nissl bodies 
stop at the axon hillock but extend into the 
base of the dendrites. Neurotubules play a 
signiﬁcant role in anterograde and retrograde 
axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and other 
molecules, mediated by molecular motor 
proteins kinesin (anterograde transport) and 
cytoplasmic dynein (retrograde transport).

• Neurons can be classiﬁed according to the 
number of processes as:
  (1) Multipolar neurons (a single axon and 
multiple dendrites; for example, pyramidal 
cells of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of 
the cerebellar cortex).
  (2) Bipolar neurons (with two processes; 
found in the sensory system).
  (3) Pseudounipolar neurons (a single short 
process; localized in sensory ganglia of cranial 
and spinal nerves).          
  Multipolar neurons can be subclassiﬁed ac-
cording to the length of processes as: 
  (1) Golgi type I neurons (the axon extends 
beyond the limits of the dendritic tree;  for 
example, pyramidal neurons and Purkinje 
neurons).
  (2) Golgi type II neurons (the axon termi-
nates close to the body and does not extend 
beyond the limits of the dendritic tree; for 
example, stellate cells of the cerebral cortex).

• There is a speciﬁc nomenclature for groups 
of neurons and axons:
  (1) A nucleus (plural nuclei) is an aggregate 
of neurons in the CNS. 
  (2) Neuropil designates the clustering 
of dendrites, axons, and glial cells within a 
nucleus and between neuronal bodies. 
  (3) A stratum or lamina is the aggregate of 
neurons in a layer. 
  (4) Bundles of axons in the CNS are called 
tracts, fasciculi (bundles), or lemnisci. 
  (5) A ganglion (plural ganglia) is a cluster of 
neurons in the PNS. A ganglion can be sensory 
(dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglion) or 
motor (visceromotor or autonomic ganglia).
  (6) Axons derived from a ganglion are orga-
nized as nerves, ramus (plural rami), or roots.

• A synapse is the junction between the 
presynaptic terminal of an axon (transmitting 
site) and the postsynaptic membrane (receiv-
ing site), usually of a dendrite, separated by a 
synaptic cleft. A presynaptic density (corre-
sponding to speciﬁc protein—some of them 
associated to synaptic vesicles—and channels; 
the active site of a synaptic ending) and a 
postsynaptic density (receptors for neurotrans-
mitters) are seen on the corresponding 
membranes. 
   Synapses can be:
  (1) Axospinous (axon terminal facing a 
dendritic spine).
  (2) Axodendritic (axon terminal on the shaft 
of a dendrite).

  (3) Axosomatic (axon terminal on the soma 
of a neuron).
  (4) Axoaxonic (axon terminal ending on an 
axon terminal).

• Glial cells include:
  (1) Astrocytes (derived from the neuroecto-
derm).
  (2) Oligodendrocytes (derived from the 
neuroectoderm).
  (3) Microglia (derived from the mesoderm). 
  Astrocytes can be subdivided into ﬁbrous 
astrocytes (predominant in white matter), and 
protoplasmic astrocytes (found mainly in gray 
matter). Astrocytes contain in their cytoplasm 
the intermediate ﬁlament protein glial ﬁbrillary 
acidic protein. 
  Brain capillaries and the inner surface of the 
pia are surrounded by the glia limitans, cor-
responding to astrocytic end-feet. 
   Oligodendrocytes are involved in axonal my-
elination within the CNS. Each oligodendrocyte 
provides myelin to several axons. The node 
of Ranvier (ﬂanked by internode segments) 
is devoid of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm; the 
space is occupied by an astrocytic end-foot 
process.
   Microglial cells are phagocytic cells and 
immunoprotect the brain and spinal cord. In 
response to brain injury or immunologic activ-
ity, microglial cells change into an activated 
state characterized by an ameboidal morphol-
ogy accompanied by the up-regulation of cell 
surface molecules. 
   Microglial cells may become overactivated 
and exert neurotoxic effects by the excessive 
production of cytotoxic substances such as 
ROS, nitric oxide, and tumor necrosis factor 
ligand. Activated microglial cells are present in 
large numbers in neurodegenerative diseases 
(Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,  
multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Huntington’s disease), causing a generalized 
microglial hyperactivity, a condition called reac-
tive microgliosis. 
   Microglia-mediated neurotoxicity takes place 
when pathogen- associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs) bind to pattern recognition recep-
tors (PRRs) and trigger an excessive immune 
response. A given ligand can be recognized by 
several PRRs (cumulative effect). 
   PRRs are responsible for phagocytic func-
tions (identiﬁcation of pathogens, produc-
tion of extracellular superoxide, release of 
pro-inﬂammatory factors and removal of toxic 
substances by phagocytosis).

•  Myelin is a highly organized multilamellar 
structure formed by the plasma membrane of 
oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. 
  Myelin surrounds axons and facilitates 
conduction of a nerve impulse by providing 
insulation to axons and clustering Na+ chan-
nels in the nodes of Ranvier. This arrange-
ment enables the action potential to jump 
along nodes by a mechanism called saltatory 
conduction. Saltatory conduction decreases 
energy requirements for the transmission of a 
nerve impulse.

   During myelinization, cytoplasmic processes 
of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells wrap 
around the axon. Note a difference: several 
cytoplasmic processes of an oligodendro-
cytes wrap around different axons, whereas a 
Schwann cell supplies only one axon.
  Visualization of myelin by electron micros-
copy reveals two types of densities: 
  (1) The intraperiod line, representing the 
close apposition of the external surfaces of 
the plasma membrane with remnant extracel-
lular space.
  (2) The major dense line, corresponding 
to the apposition of the inner (cytoplasmic) 
surfaces of the plasma membrane. 
   The incisures of Schmidt-Lanterman repre-
sent residual cytoplasm. The major dense line 
is slightly thinner in myelin of the CNS. 
   Proteins of myelin include:
  (1) Myelin basic protein (MBP) present in 
myelin of the CNS and PNS.
  (2) Proteolipid protein (PLP) found in my-
elin of the CNS.
  (3) Myelin protein zero (MPZ) the equiva-
lent of PLP in the PNS. 
  MPZ is responsible for maintaining myelin in 
a compact state. A mutation of the PLP gene 
and its alternatively transcribed protein DM20 
causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, an 
X-linked neuropathy affecting males and char-
acterized by a reduction in the white matter. 
   Proteins of myelin are strong antigens and 
have a role in the development of multiple 
sclerosis in the CNS and Guillain-Barré 
syndrome in the PNS.
      Myelin is separated from the axon by 
the axolemma, the surface membrane of 
the axon. Tight junctions (represented by 
claudins and zonula occludens proteins) are 
found linking the plasma membranes of the 
same Schwann cell and adjacent Schwann 
cell at the level of the node of Ranvier. Gap 
junctions, containing connexin 32 (Cx32), 
are present in the region of the incisures of 
Schmidt-Lanterman. Mutations in the Cx32 
gene determine the X-linked Charcot-Marie-
Tooth disease, a demyelinating disorder of 
the PNS.
   Multiple sclerosis is a clinically recurrent or 
chronically progressive neurologic dysfunction 
caused by multiple areas of demyelination in 
the CNS, in particular the brain, optic nerves, 
and spinal cord. 
  Two characteristic microscopic features are:  
  (1) Inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells (T cells 
and macrophages) inside and around multiple 
sclerosis plaques.
  (2) Plaques of astrocytic aggregates.
  CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, recruited to multiple 
sclerosis lesions, secrete cytokines (interleu-
kin-2, tumor necrosis factor ligand [TNFL], and 
interferon-(cid:97)).
  T cells secrete Fas ligand that binds to Fas 
receptor on oligodendrocytes to induce their 
apoptosis. TNFL exerts a similar apoptotic 
effect. Demyelinating axons by macrophages 
with foamy cytoplasm, and reactive astrocytes 
(Creutzfeldt cells) with several cytoplasmic 
nuclear fragments are observed.

•  The ependyma lines the surface of the ven-
tricles (brain) and central canal (spinal cord). It 
consists of two cell types: 
  (1) Ependymal cells, a simple cuboidal epi-
thelium with apical microvilli, one or more cilia, 
linked by desmosomes, and a basal domain in 
contact with an astrocyte end-foot layer. 
  (2) Tanycytes, a specialized ependymal cell 
with a basal cell process making contact with a 
blood vessel.
   The choroid plexus produces cerebrospinal 
ﬂuid (CSF). The plexus consists of epithelial 
cells linked by tight junctions and with apical 
microvilli containing Na+,K+-ATPase, which 
pumps Na+ into the lumen of the ventricle. 
High Na+ concentration in the ventricular 
lumen facilitates the diffusion of water by 
an osmotic gradient. The basal domain has 
numerous infoldings. 
  Hydrostatic pressure inside the subjacent 
fenestrated capillaries produces a net ﬂow 
of water, solutes, and proteins. The lining 
epithelium of the choroid plexus screens and 
excludes several substances from entering the 
CSF.
   The CSF ﬂows from the fourth ventricle into 
the brain and spinal subarachnoid space and 
exits the CNS at the superior sagittal sinus.

• Three brain permeability barriers exist: 
  (1) The arachnoid-CSF barrier, consisting 
of the arachnoid membrane, which prevents 
the CSF from coming in contact with the 
extracellular space of the dura mater, and 
the arachnoid villi, which enable the CSF to 
permeate across arachnoid barrier cells and 
endothelial cells. 
  (2) The blood-CSF barrier, with a role of the 
choroid epithelium in selecting protein and 
solutes that may reach the ventricular space.
  (3) The blood-brain barrier, represented by 
tight junctions sealing the interendothelial 
space. Astrocyte end-feet in contact with the 
capillary wall contribute to the barrier.
   Brain metastatic tumors can develop and 
grow in the absence of angiogenesis by 
co-opting the pre-existing brain vasculature. 
Metastases to the brain are perivascular. 
  Metastatic cells avoid apoptosis and co-opt 
brain vessels by expressing the protein neu-
roserpin. 
  Neuroserpin inhibit the production of plas-
minogen activator by astrocytes, blocking the 
release of plasmin from plasminogen and the 
secretion of the apoptosis inducer FAS ligand. 
Suppression of plasmin and FAS ligand enable 
metastatic cancer cells to retain adhesion to 
the brain vasculature, a landmark of vascular 
co-option.

• The PNS consists of supporting cell types 
associated to axons extending from neuronal 
elements of the spinal cord and autonomic 
and sensory ganglia. 

  (1) Schwann cells are the equivalent of the 
oligodendrocytes of the CNS. 
  (2) Satellite cells surround the cell bodies of 
neurons in autonomic and sensory ganglia. 
   Schwann cells can provide a myelin sheath 
to a myelinated nerve ﬁber by forming only 
one internode segment of myelin (a single 
oligodendrocyte can form several internode 
segments). In contrast, several unmyelin-
ated nerve ﬁbers can be embedded in the 
cytoplasm of a single Schwann cell (in the 
CNS, unmyelinated nerves are ensheathed by 
astrocytes). 
   A peripheral nerve is covered by layers of 
connective tissue:
  (1) The epineurium covers the entire nerve.
  (2) The perineurium separates the nerve 
into fascicles and consists of neuroepithelial 
perineurial cells. Perineurial cells are joined to 
each other by tight junctions to form the pro-
tective diffusion barrier: the blood-nerve bar-
rier, responsible for maintaining the physiologic 
microenvironment of the endoneurium. 
  (3) The endoneurium surrounds individual 
axons and their associated Schwann cells.

•  Schwannomas are benign encapsulated tu-
mors consisting of Schwann cells. Schwanno-
mas can develop at the surface or inside of a 
nerve fascicle and display spindle cells (called 
Antoni A pattern) or multipolar cells (called 
Antoni B pattern), the latter representing the 
result of a degenerative process. All schwanno-
mas are immunoreactive for S-100 protein.

• Peripheral nerves can be injured (traumatic 
crush nerve injury) or diseases may affect the 
function of Schwann cells, leading to a loss of 
myelin (segmental demyelinization). 
  A damage to a neuron and its axon causes 
axonal degeneration, also called wallerian 
degeneration. 
   A characteristic of axonal degeneration, 
caused by toxic or metabolic damage, is chro-
matolysis, the dispersion of Nissl substance 
(polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic 
reticulum) in the neuronal soma, followed by 
demyelinization. 
  Segmental demyelinization and axonal 
degeneration affect the motor unit and cause 
muscle paralysis. Axonal degeneration may be 
followed by axonal regeneration in the PNS. 
Axonal regeneration in the CNS is not feasible 
because the endoneurium is not present, 
oligodendrocytes—in contrast to Schwann 
cells—do not proliferate, and astrocytes deposit 
scar tissue (astrocytic plaque).
  Neuroma is the disorganized proliferation of 
axons, Schwann cells and perineural connec-
tive tissue at the site of complete or partial 
nerve injury transection

• Neurodegenerative diseases. 
  (1) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a 

motor neuron progressive disease starting 
with moderate weakness in one limb and 
progressing to severe paralysis. A mutation in 
the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase gene is 
frequently seen. 
  (2) Alzheimer’s disease, the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized 
by progressive cortical dementia affecting 
language and memory. A typical feature is 
the formation of amyloid plaques containing 
(cid:96)-amyloid peptide. 
  (3) Parkinson’s disease, the second most 
frequent after Alzheimer’s disease, is caused 
by a loss of dopaminergic neurons from the 
substantia nigra. Resting tremor and move-
ments with rigidity are the typical clinical fea-
tures. A characteristic pathologic aspect is the 
presence of deposits of hyperphosphorylated 
(cid:95)(cid:60)synuclein in the cytoplasm of neurons 
(Lewy bodies) and threadlike inclusions in 
axons (Lewy neurites).  
  A familial form of Parkinson’s disease is  
PARK2 (Parkinson’s disease protein 2). 
  PARK2 encodes the E3 ubiquitin-protein 
ligase parkin.  Parkin is involved in the 
maintenance of mitochondria. Defective 
mitochondria can trigger the production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupt cell 
functions.
  Mitophagy is a speciﬁc mechanism to elimi-
nate damaged mitochondria by a signaling 
pathway involving two enzymes: 
  (1) PINK1 (PTEN [phosphatase and tensin 
homolog] induced putative kinase 1).
  (2) Parkin. 
  The accumulation of damaged mitochondria, 
caused by mutations in parkin and PINK1, 
determine high mitochondrial oxidative stress 
in dopamine neurons, the initial step of the 
familial forms of Parkinson’s disease.    
  (4) Huntington’s disease, is a neurode-
generative disease caused by a the gene 
huntingtin (HTT) containing a number of CAG 
repeats in the coding region and expressing a 
so called polyQ HTT protein. 
   Huntington’s disease is characterized by 
the progressive activation of caspases and 
cytochrome c following accumulation of 
mutated protein hungtingtin in the neuronal 
cell nucleus. 

• Sensory ganglia (dorsal root ganglia) are 
surrounded by a connective tissue capsule 
(epineurium). Neurons are clustered and 
are pseudounipolar. Nerve fascicles contain 
myelinated nerve ﬁbers. Each neuron is sur-
rounded by satellite cells supported by a basal 
lamina. 
  Autonomic ganglia receive preganglionic 
axons from the CNS and give rise to post-
ganglionic unmyelinated axons. Multipolar 
neurons are scattered and surrounded by 
satellite cells (less numerous than those of 
sensory ganglia).

9. Sensory Organs: Vision and Hearing

The eye can self-focus, adjust for light intensity, and convert light into electrical impulses interpreted by the 
visual cortex of the brain as detailed images. In humans, the eye is recessed in a bony orbit and is connected 
to the brain by the optic nerve. The eyeball  protects and facilitates the function of the photoreceptive retina, 
the inner layer of the eyeball harboring photosensitive cells, rods and cones.  The ear consists of two anatomic 
systems designed to amplify sound waves and transmit them to the brain for hearing and for maintaining the 
sense of body equilibrium by detecting rotation, gravity and acceleration. This chapter provides a comprehensive 
description of the main histologic components of the eye and ear and addresses pathologic, degenerative, and 
genetic–based clinical conditions.

Eye
The eyeball consists of  three tunics or layers (Figure 
9-1) which, from outside to inside, are:

1. The sclera and the cornea.
2. The uvea.
3. The retina. 
Three distinct and interconnected chambers are 
found inside the eyeball: the anterior chamber, the 
posterior chamber, and the vitreous cavity (see Box 
9-A). Aqueous humor circulates from the posterior 
to the anterior chamber. The lens is placed in front of 
the vitreous cavity, which contains vitreous humor. 
The bony orbit, the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the 
lacrimal apparatus protect the eyeball. 

The ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal 

carotid artery, provides nutrients to the eye and the 
contents  of  the  orbit. The  superior  and  inferior 
orbital  veins  are  the  principal  venous  drainage  of 
the eye. The veins empty into the intracranial cav-
ernous sinus.

Development of the eye
A brief summary of the development of the eye is 
essential to the understanding of the relationship of 
the various layers in the eyeball. The components of 
the eye derive from:

1. The surface ectoderm of the head.
2. The lateral neuroectodermal walls of the em-

bryonic brain in the diencephalon region.

3. The mesenchyme.

•  The eye consists of three chambers: (1) The anterior 
chamber is the space between the cornea and the 
anterior surface of the iris. (2) The posterior chamber 
extends from the posterior surface of the iris to the lens. 
(3) The vitreous cavity or body is posterior to the lens 
and is the largest compartment.
•  The human eyeball is roughly spherical with a diam-
eter of about 24 mm. The anterior pole of the eyeball is 
the center of the cornea. 
•  The posterior pole is located between the optic disk 
and the fovea, a shallow depression in the retina. The 
anatomic axis (also called the optical axis) is the 
line connecting the two poles. The visual axis joins 
the  apparent center of the pupil and  the center of the 
fovea and divides the eyeball into nasal and temporal 
halves.
•  The eyeball is surrounded by a soft tissue cushion 
occupying the bony orbit of the skull. The soft tissue 
includes loose connective tissue, fat, muscles, blood 
and lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the lacrimal gland. 
•  The anterior surface of the eyeball is connected to the  
integument by the conjunctiva, which lines the inner 
surface of the lids and reﬂects over the eyeball to the 
edge of the cornea.

Lateral outpocketings of the right and left sides 
of the diencephalon give rise to two neuroepithelial 
optic vesicles, each remaining attached to the brain 
wall by a hollow optic stalk (Figure 9-2). The surface 
ectoderm  of  the  head  invaginates  into  the  optical 
vesicle forming a lens vesicle that pinches off. Mes-
enchyme  surrounds  both  the  lens  vesicle  and  the 
adjacent optic vesicle. 

The  optic  vesicle  invaginates  and  becomes  a 
double-walled optic cup (see Figure 9-2). The optic 
ﬁssure  forms when the outer layer of the optic cup 
becomes the pigmented epithelium. Cells in the in-
ner layer proliferate and stratify to form the neural 

 Box 9-B  |  Development of the cornea

•  The lens induces the differentiation of the overlying ectoderm. Cells of the 
mesenchyme secrete types I and II collagen, components of the primary 
stroma of the cornea.
•   Capillary endothelial cells  migrate  into  the  primary  stroma  and  produce 
hyaluronic acid, causing the stroma to swell. 
•  Mesenchymal cells in the surrounding space migrate into the stroma and 
secrete hyaluronidase. The stroma shrinks, and the cornea acquires the correct 
shape and transparency.

retina. The mesenchyme extending into the invagina-
tion of the optic cup acquires a gelatinous consistency 
and  becomes  the  vitreous  component    of  the  eye. 
The lens vesicle  is kept in place by the free margins 
of the optic cup and the surrounding mesenchyme. 
At the outer surface of the optic cup, the mesenchy-
mal shell differentiates into the vascular choroid coat 
of the eye and the ﬁbrous components of the sclera  
and cornea (Figure 9-3; see Box 9-B). Posterior to the 
lens, the vascular choroid coat forms the ciliary body, 
ciliary muscle, and ciliary processes. Anterior to the 
lens, the choroid coat forms the stroma of the iris.

The ciliary processes secrete the aqueous humor  
that  accumulates  first  in  the  posterior  chamber 
(between the iris and lens) and then passes into the 
anterior chamber (between the lens and cornea) across 
the  pupil. The  aqueous  humor  leaves  the  anterior 
chamber  by  entering  into  the  canal  of  Schlemm, 
linked to the sinus venosus of the sclera, a small vein 
encircling the eye at the anterior edge of the choroid 
coat or tunica. 

Around the rim of the optic cup, the inner and 
outer  layers  form  the  posterior  epithelium  of  the 
ciliary body and iris. The sphincter and dilator pupil-
lae muscles  develop from the posterior epithelium. 
The  inner  layer  of  the  optic  cup  becomes  the 
neural layer of the retina, which differentiates into 
photosensory cells, bipolar neurons, and ganglionic 
neurons (including interconnecting horizontal and 
amacrine cells and glial Müller cells). Axons from the 
ganglionic neurons form the nerve ﬁber layer of the 
retina, which converges on the optic stalk occupying 
the optic ﬁssure as the optic nerve. The optic ﬁssure 
becomes the escape route from the optic cup (except 
at its rim).

Outer tunic: Sclera and cornea
The sclera (Figure 9-4) is a 1.0- to 0.4-mm-thick layer 
of collagen and elastic ﬁbers produced by ﬁbroblasts. 
The inner side of the sclera faces the choroid, from 
which it is separated by a layer of loose connective 
tissue  and  an  elastic  tissue  network  known  as  the 
suprachoroid  lamina. Tendons  of  the  six  extrinsic 
muscles of the eye are attached to the outer surface 
of the sclera.

Cornea
The cornea is 0.8-1.1 mm thick and has a smaller 
radius of curvature than the sclera. It is transparent, 
lacks  blood  vessels,  and  is  extremely  rich  in  nerve 
endings. The anterior surface of the cornea is always 
kept wet with a ﬁlm of tears retained  by microvilli 
of the apical epithelial cells. The cornea is one of the 
few organs that can be transplanted without a risk 
of being rejected by the host’s immune system. This 
success can be attributed to the lack of corneal blood 
and lymphatic vessels.

The cornea is composed of ﬁve layers (Figure 9-5): 

1. The corneal epithelium. 
2. The layer or membrane of Bowman. 
3. The stroma or substantia propria. 
4. The membrane of Descemet. 
5. The corneal endothelium.
The corneal epithelium is a non-keratinized strati-
ﬁed squamous and consists of ﬁve to seven  layers of 
cells. Cells of the outer surface have microvilli and all 
cells are connected to one another by desmosomes. 
The epithelium of the cornea is very sensitive, con-
tains a large number of free nerve endings and has a 
remarkable wound healing capacity. At the limbus, 
the corneoscleral junction, the corneal epithelium is 
continuous with that of the conjunctiva.

The cytoplasm of the basal layer cells express kera-
tin 5 and keratin 14 (K5 and K14) that are replaced 
in the upper layers by corneal-speciﬁc K3 and K12. 
Corneal epithelial cells undergo continuous renewal 
from limbus stem cells (LSC). LSC migrate trans-
versely from the limbus toward the central cornea.  
A deﬁciency in LSC changes the cornea into a non-
transparent, keratinized skin-like epithelium leading 
to partial or complete blindness.

Bowman’s  layer  is  6  to  9  μm  thick,  consists  of 
type I collagen ﬁbrils, and lacks elastic ﬁbers. This 
layer is transparent and does not have regenerative 
capacity. Bowman’s layer is the anteriormost part of 
the corneal stroma, although differently organized. 
For  this  reason,  it  is  designated  “layer”  instead  of 
“membrane.” Bowman’s layer represents a protective 
barrier to trauma and bacterial invasion.

The  highly  transparent  stroma  or  substantia 
propria  represents  about  90%  of  the  thickness  of 
the cornea. Bundles of types I and V collagen form 
thin  layers  regularly  arranged  in  successive  planes 
crossing at various angles and forming a lattice that 

is highly resistant to deformations and trauma. Fibers 
and  layers  are  separated  by  an  extracellular  matrix 
rich  in  proteoglycans  containing  chondroitin  and 
keratan sulfate. 

Nerves  in  transit  to  the  corneal  epithelium  are 

found in the corneal stroma.

Descemet’s membrane, one of the thickest base-
ment membranes in the body (5 to 10 μm thick), is 
produced by the corneal endothelium and contains 
type VII  collagen,  which  forms  a  hexagonal  array 
of ﬁbers.

The corneal endothelium lines the posterior surface 
of Descemet’s membrane and faces the anterior cham-
ber of the eye. It consists of a single layer of squamous 
epithelial cells, with impermeable intercellular spaces 
preventing inﬂux of aqueous humor into the corneal 
stroma. The structural and functional integrity of the 
corneal endothelium is vital to the maintenance of 
corneal transparency (see Box 9-C).

Middle tunic: Uvea
The uvea forms the pigmented vascularized tunic of 
the eye and is divided into three regions (see Figure 
9-4; see Box 9-D): 
1. The choroid.
2. The ciliary body.
3. The iris.
The choroid consists of three layers (Figure 9-6):
1. Bruch’s membrane, the innermost component 
of the choroid, consists of a network of collagen and 
elastic ﬁbers and basal lamina material. Basal laminae 
derive from the pigmented epithelium of the retina 
and  the  endothelia  of  the  underlying  fenestrated 
capillaries.

2. The choriocapillaris contains fenestrated capil-
laries that supply oxygen and nutrients to the outer 
layers of the retina and the fovea.

The cornea (Latin corneus, horny) is 
transparent. The rest of the wall of the eye, the 
sclera (Greek scleros, hard), is opaque and 
lined inside by the middle or vascular pigmented 
layer that absorbs light. 
    The limbus is the zone of transition of the 
epithelium of the conjunctiva with that of the 
cornea. The limbus is also the boundary of the 
transparent cornea with the opaque sclera. 
The corneoscleral coat: 
   1. Protects the inner structures of the eye. 
   2. Together with the intraocular fluid pressure, 
it maintains the shape and consistency of the 
eyeball.

In the posterior two thirds of the eye, the 
vascular layer is called the choroid. In the 
anterior part of the eye the vascular layer 
thickens to form the ciliary body.  
    Ciliary processes extend inward from the 
ciliary body. The vascular layer continues as the 
iris, whose free edge outlines the pupil.
   1. The vascular layer is pigmented, a property 
that light-proofs the inner surface of the eye and 
reduces reflection of the light.
   2. Blood vessels travel through the middle 
layer.
   3. Its anterior portion contains smooth muscle: 
the muscle of the ciliary body and the dilator 
and constrictor of the iris. The smooth muscle 
of the ciliary body regulates the tension of the 
zonule or suspensory ligament of the lens 
and, therefore, is an important element in the 
mechanism of accommodation.

3. The choroidal stroma consists of large arteries 
and veins surrounded by collagen and elastic ﬁbers, 
ﬁbroblasts, a few smooth muscle cells, neurons of the 
autonomic nervous system, and melanocytes.

The ciliary body (Figure 9-7) is  anterior to the 
ora serrata and represents the ventral projection of 
both the choroid and the retina. It is made up of two 
components: 

1. The uveal portion.
2. The neuroepithelial portion.
 The uveal portion of the ciliary body includes:
1. The continuation of the outer layer of the cho-

roid, known as the supraciliaris.

2. The  ciliary  muscle,  a  ring  of  smooth  muscle 
tissue that, when contracted, reduces the length of 
the circular suspensory ligaments of the lens; this 
is known as the ciliary zonule. 

3. A layer of fenestrated capillaries supplying blood 

to the ciliary muscle. 

The neuroepithelial  portion contributes the two

Organization of the eye

It consists of two layers: (1) an outer 
pigmented layer (pars pigmentosa) and (2) an 
inner retinal layer (pars nervosa or optica). 
The retina has a posterior two-thirds 
light-sensitive zone (pars optica) and an 
anterior one-third light-nonsensitive zone 
(pars ciliaris and iridica). The scalloped border 
between these two zones is called the ora 
serrata (Latin ora, edge; serrata, sawlike). 
    The retina contains photoreceptor neurons 
(cones and rods), conducting neurons 
(bipolar and ganglion cells), association 
neurons (horizontal and amacrine cells), and a 
supporting neuroglial cell, the Müller cell.
    Each eye contains about 125 million rods 
and cones but only 1 million ganglion cells. The 
number of cones and rods varies over the 
surface of the retina. Only cones are present 
in the fovea (0.5 mm in diameter), where fine 
detail vision is best.  Axons from the retinal 
ganglion cells pass across the surface of the 
retina, converge on the papilla or optic disk, 
and leave the eye through many openings of 
the sclera (the lamina cribrosa) to form the 
optic nerve.

layers of the ciliary epithelium: 

1. An outer pigmented epithelial layer, continu-
ous with the retinal pigmented epithelium. The pig-
mented epithelial layer is supported by a basal lamina 
continuous with Bruch’s membrane. 

2. An inner nonpigmented epithelial layer, which 

is continuous with the sensory retina.

  Particular  features  of  these  two  pigmented  and 

nonpigmented epithelial cell layers are: 

1.  The  apical  surfaces  of    the  pigmented  and 

nonpigmented cells face each other. 

2. The dual epithelium is smooth at its posterior 
end (pars plana) and  folded at the anterior end (pars 
plicata) to form the ciliary processes.

 Box 9-C  |  Corneal transplantation

•  Corneal transplantation, also known as penetrating keratoplasty, is the 
most common form of tissue allotransplantation (Greek allos, other) with a suc-
cess rate of over 90%. 
•  This success is related to various aspects of the cornea and the ocular micro-
environment: (1) The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
class II is negligible or absent in the normal cornea. (2) The cornea secretes 
immunosuppressive factors that inhibit T cell and complement activation 
(see Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System). (3) Cells in the cornea express 
Fas ligand, which protects the eye from cell-mediated damage by eliminating 
apoptosis cells that can determine inﬂammatory damage (see Apoptosis in 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).  (4) Corneal Langerhans cells (see Chapter 11, 
Integumentary System) and antigen-presenting cells are rare in the cornea. 
(5) The cornea is avascular and lacks lymphatics, thus preventing the arrival 
of immune elements. (6) Limbus stem cells maintain the corneal epithelium 
transparent and are responsible for the repair of the damaged corneal surface.    

3. The  aqueous  humor  is  secreted  by  epithelial 
cells of the ciliary processes supplied by fenestrated 
capillaries (Figure 9-8) .

The iris is a continuation of the ciliary body and is 
located in front of the lens. At this position, it forms 
a gate for the ﬂow of aqueous humor between the 
anterior and posterior chambers of the eye and also 
controls the amount of light entering the eye.

The iris has two components (see Figure 9-7):
1. The anterior uveal or stromal face.
2. The posterior neuroepithelial surface. 
The anterior (outer) uveal face is of mesenchymal 
origin and has an irregular surface. It is formed by 
ﬁbroblasts and pigmented melanocytes embedded 
in an extracellular matrix. The number of pigmented 
melanocytes  determines  the  color  of  the  iris.  In 
albinos, the iris appears pink due to the abundant 
blood vessels. Blood vessels of the iris have a radial 
distribution and can adjust to changes in length in 
parallel to variations in the diameter of the pupil.

The  posterior  (inner)  neuroepithelial  surface 
consists of two layers of pigmented epithelium. The 
outer layer, a continuation of the pigmented layer of 
the ciliary epithelium, consists of myoepithelial cells 
that become the dilator pupillae muscle. The smooth 
muscle of the sphincter pupillae is located in the iris 
stroma around the pupil.

 Box 9-D  |  Uvea 

•  The uvea has signiﬁcant clinical relevance. The uvea can be affected by sev-
eral inﬂammatory processes known as uveitis, which can target the iris (iritis), 
the ciliary body (cyclitis), and the choroid (choroiditis). 
•  Uveal inﬂammation can be secondary to an immune-mediated disease or 
infection (for example, cytomegalovirus).  An inﬂammatory exudate in choroi-
ditis can lead to detachment of the retina.  The inﬂammatory destruction of the 
choroid can cause degeneration of the photoreceptors whose nutrition depends 
on the integrity of the choroid.
•   Melanocytes are abundant in the choroid and they can give rise to ocular 
melanomas, pigmented malignant tumors that can cause systemic metastasis.

278

 9. SENSORY ORGANS

Uvea

Three chambers of the eye
The eye contains three chambers (see Figure 9-1): 

1. The anterior chamber.
2. The posterior chamber.
3. The vitreous cavity. 
The anterior chamber occupies the space between 
the corneal endothelium (anterior boundary) and the 
anterior surface of the iris, the pupillary portion of 
the lens, and the base of the ciliary body (posterior 
boundary). The circumferential angle of the anterior 
chamber is occupied by the trabecular meshwork, a 
drainage site for the aqueous humor into the canal 
of Schlemm (Figures 9-9 and 9-10).

The posterior chamber (see Figure 9-9) is limited 
anteriorly  by  the  posterior  surface  of  the  iris  and 
posteriorly by the lens and the zonular ﬁbers (sus-
pensory ligaments of the lens). The circumferential 
angle is occupied by the ciliary  processes, the site of 
aqueous humor production.

The vitreous cavity is occupied by a transparent gel 
substance, the vitreous humor, and extends from the 
lens to the retina. The vitreous humor is the largest 
component of the eye. The longest part of the opti-
cal path from the cornea to the retina is through the 
vitreous humor. 

The vitreous humor contains mostly water (99%), 
hyaluronic acid, and type II collagen ﬁbrils, a close 
relative of the collagen in cartilage. Recall from the 
discussion on the extracellular matrix of connective 
tissue  that  the  glycosaminoglycan  hyaluronic  acid 
has signiﬁcant afﬁnity for water. Fully hydrated hy-
aluronic acid, associated with widely spaced collagen 
ﬁbrils, is responsible for changes in vitreous volume. 
Hyaluronic acid and type II collagen are produced 
by hyalocytes.

Lens
The cornea, the three chambers of the eye, and the 
lens are three transparent structures through which 
light must pass to reach the retina. Note that the re-
fractive surface of the cornea is an interface between 
air and tissue and that the lens is in a ﬂuid environ-
ment whose refractive index is higher than that of air.
The  lens  is  a  transparent,  biconvex,  elastic,  and 
avascular  structure  (Figure  9-11).  Zonular  ﬁbers, 
consisting of elastin ﬁbrils and a polysaccharide ma-
trix, extend from the ciliary epithelium and insert at 
the equatorial portion of the capsule. They maintain 
the lens in place and, during accommodation, change 
the shape and optical power of the lens in response 
to forces exerted by the ciliary muscle. The zonular 
ﬁbers support the lens “as guy wires support a tent.”
The lens consists of a series of concentric shells or 
layers forming the lens substance. The inner part of 
the lens is the nucleus. The outer part is the cortex. 
The anterior epithelium has a single layer of epithelial

smooth muscle cells, neurons of the autonomic 
nervous system, blood vessels (arteries and

    Melanocytes are more numerous in heavily 
pigmented individuals than in persons with light 
pigment.

Choriocapillaris

Capillaries of the choriocapillaris connect with 
arteries (branches of the posterior ciliary 
arteries) and veins (vortex veins) in the 
choroidal stroma.
    The choriocapillaris provides nutrients to the 
outer layers of the retina.

cells and is the source of new cells of the lens. The 
posterior epithelium disappears early in the forma-
tion of the lens. The anterior epithelium and lens 
substance are enclosed by the lens capsule. There is 
no epithelial cell layer under the posterior surface of

The lens capsule is a thick ﬂexible acellular and

The iris has two

The posterior surface 
is lined by a dual layer 
of pigmented 
epithelial cells, a 
direct continuation of 
the pigmented layer of 
the retina.  The stroma 
contains melanocytes 
and myoepithelial 
cells forming the 
dilator pupillae.

The sphincter pupillae, 
consisting of smooth 
muscle cells, has 
acetylcholine 
receptors and is 
innervated by 
parasympathetic nerve 
fibers. Sphincter 
contraction reduces the 
diameter of the pupil, 
or miosis.

Dual pigmented cell layer  

The ciliary epithelium is an extension of the retina beyond the ora 
serrata and covers the inner surface of the ciliary body.  It consists 
of two layers: an inner layer of nonpigmented cells, a direct 
continuation of the sensory retina, facing the posterior chamber, 
and an outer layer of pigmented  cells, continuous with the retinal 
pigmented epithelium, in contact with the stroma of the ciliary body. 

As the ciliary epithelium approaches the base of the iris, the cells 
of the inner layer accumulate pigment granules and both layers 
are pigmented. Aqueous humor is secreted by the epithelial cells 
of the ciliary processes supplied by fenestrated capillaries.     
Zonular fibers, normally associated with the ciliary processes, are 
not seen in Figure 9-7 but are depicted in Figure 9-11.

of unique cytoskeletal proteins:

1. Filensin, an intermediate ﬁlament that contains 

attachment sites for crystallins.

2. Lens-speciﬁc proteins called  crystallins ((cid:95), (cid:96), 
and (cid:97)). Filensin and crystallins maintain the confor-
mation and transparency of the lens ﬁber cell. 

Lens cell ﬁbers interdigitate at the medial suture 
region. At these contact sites, gap junctions and some 
spot desmosomes interlock the opposing cytoplasmic 
processes. The inner cortical region and the core of 
the lens consist of older lens ﬁbers lacking nuclei. 
About  80%  of  its  available  glucose  is  metabolized 
by the lens. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Cataracts
Cataracts  are  an  opacity  of  the  lens  caused  by  a 

change in the solubility of lens proteins as they age. 
This condition causes high light scattering by the ag-
gregated ﬁlensin and crystallins and impairs accurate 
vision. Cataracts can be cortical, nuclear or posterior 
subcapsular.  Most  age-related  cataracts  are  cortical 
cataracts.  Cataracts  absorb  and  scatter  more  light 
than the normal regions of the lens, producing more 
light spread and a decrease in contrast of the retinal 
image. The result is reduced visual acuity. 

Cataract surgery consists in a small incision made 
through the peripheral cornea behind the canal of 
Schlemm.  After  opening  the  anterior  lens  capsule 
with a cutting tool, the anterior cortex and nucleus 
are  removed  through  a  suction  line. The  posterior 
capsule is left intact. A ﬂexible silicone lens, rolled 
up as a small tube, is inserted and opens up inside

The canal of Schlemm is a modified annular space
forming a complete circle at the apex of the 
anterior chamber angle (at the corneal-irideal 
angle).
    The canal of Schlemm is the major escape route 
(80%) of the aqueous fluid produced by the ciliary 
body. A minor draining route (20%) is by fluid 
percolation into the connective tissue surrounding 
the muscle fibers of the ciliary body (uveoscleral 
flow). The fluid reaches the sclera and is drained 
by veins and lymphatics. 

Clinical significance: Glaucoma

An obstruction in the drainage of aqueous humor 
leads to an increase in intraocular pressure that 
gradually damages the retina and causes blindness 
if untreated. This condition is called glaucoma and 
produces pain and nausea as typical symptoms. 
    Two forms of glaucoma are recognized:               
(1) Open-angle glaucoma, the most common  
form, occurs when the trabecular meshwork drains 
the aqueous humor but the canal of Schlemm is 
obstructed. (2) Closed-angle glaucoma results 
when the aqueous humor is unable to reach the 
trabecular meshwork because an inflammatory 
process of the uvea (uveitis) blocks fluid access to 
the meshwork drain.
    Surgery aimed at restoring aqueous fluid outflow 
consists of the use of a laser to burn small holes in 
the trabecular meshwork (trabeculoplasty) around 
the limbus.

the eye to its original shape. The small incision does 
not require suture on completion of the procedure.

Accommodation
The sharpness of distant and close images focused on 
the retina depends on the shape of the lens (Figure 
9-12). Accommodation deﬁnes the process by which 
the lens becomes rounder to focus the image of a 
nearby object on the retina and ﬂattens when the 
image of a distant object is focused on the retina. 
Accommodation  determines  that  the  distance 
between  the  center  of  the  lens  and  the  retina  is 
equivalent to the focal distance needed for the for-
mation of a sharp image on the retina.

Three components contribute to the accommo-

dation process: 

1. The ciliary muscle.
2. The ciliary body.
3. The suspensory ligaments, inserted at the equa-

torial region of the lens capsule.

When the ciliary muscle contracts, the ciliary body 
moves toward the lens. Consequently, the tension of 
the suspensory ligaments is reduced, and the elastic 
capsule of the lens enables the lens to acquire a spheri-
cal shape. A rounded lens facilitates close vision.

When the ciliary muscle relaxes, the ciliary body  
keeps the tension of the suspensory ligaments that 
pull at the circumference of the lens. Thus, the lens 
remains ﬂat to enable distant vision. This condition 
is known as emmetropia (Greek emmetros, in proper 
measure; opia, pertaining to the eye), or normal vi-
sion.

At the equatorial region of the lens, cells 
begin to elongate and rotate so that their

surface.
    The production of lens-specific cytoplasmic 
proteins filensin and crystallins (cid:95), (cid:96), and (cid:97)(cid:3)is 
observed in these cells. The cell nucleus begins to 
disappear near the nuclear region of the lens.
    Throughout life, cells of the anterior lens epithelium, 
reaching the equatorial region of the lens, contribute to 
the cell population of the cortical lens fiber region. 
With time, the older cells become displaced toward the 
center or nucleus of the lens (the nuclear lens fiber 
region).

Zonular fibers extend  from the 
ciliary epithelium to the 
equatorial region of the capsule 
and hold the lens in place.

The lens capsule is a transparent 
and elastic membrane enclosing 
the lens substance. It consists of 
type IV collagen embedded in a 
glycosaminoglycan matrix. The lens 
capsule does not contain elastic 
fibrils.

Nutrition and metabolism of the lens

The lens does not have blood vessels but is 
metabolically active. Nutrients derive from the 
aqueous humor. 
     Structurally, the lens is mostly water and 
proteins. The major proteins are filensin and 
crystallins (cid:95), (cid:96), and (cid:97), which remain in soluble 
form in the cytoplasm of the lens cell fibers. 
   When these proteins become insoluble (aging, 
diabetes), opacity of the lens develops. This 
condition is knows as cataract. 
    Glucose is the major metabolite of the lens. 
When glucose concentration is high 
(diabetes), the byproduct sorbitol accumulates. 
Excess of sorbitol reduces the solubility of 
crystallins, leading to opacity of the lens.

If the eyeball is too deep or the curvature of the 
lens is not ﬂat enough, the image of a distant object 
forms in a plane in front of the retina. Distant objects 
are blurry because they are out of focus, but vision at 
close range is normal. This condition is called myopia 
(Greek myein, to shut), or nearsightedness.

If the eyeball is too shallow and the curvature of 
the lens is too ﬂat, the distant image is formed at 
a plane behind the retina. Distant objects are well 

resolved  but objects at a closer range are not. This 
condition is called hyperopia (Greek  hyper, above), 
or farsightedness. 

Older people become farsighted as the lens loses 
elasticity. This form of hyperopia is known as pres-
byopia (Greek presbys, old man). 

Accommodation difﬁculties can be improved by 
the use of lenses. A diverging  lens corrects myopia; 
a converging lens corrects hyperopia.

Inner layer: Retina
The retina consists of two regions (Figure 9-13): 

1. The outer nonsensory retinal pigmented epi-

thelium.

2. The inner sensory retina (see Box 9-E).
The nonsensory retinal pigmented epithelium is a 
single layer of cuboidal cells extending from the edge 
of the optic disk to the ora serrata, where it continues 
as the pigmented layer of the ciliary epithelium.

The  apical  domain  of  the  cuboidal  nonsensory 
pigmented epithelium is sealed by tight  junctions 
to form the external retinal barrier (Figure 9-14). 
Granules of melanin are present in the apical cy-
toplasm and apical cell processes. Melanin granules 
absorb excess light reaching  the photoreceptors. 

The  apical  surface  contains  microvilli  that  sur-
round  the  outer  segments  of  the  photoreceptors 
(cones and rods). 

At this location, the sensory retina and the pig-
mented epithelium are attached to each other through 
an amorphous extracellular material, the interphoto-
receptor matrix (Figure 9-15).

The inner sensory retina layer extends from the 

edge of the optic disk to the ciliary epithelium. 

The sensory retina has two clinically and anatomi-

cally important landmarks to remember: 

1. The  fovea  centralis,  a  shallow  depression  of 

about 2.5 mm in diameter.

2. The macula lutea, a yellow rim surrounding the 

fovea centralis. 

The fovea is the area of the retina where vision is 
the sharpest and is crossed by the visual axis.  We 
discuss these structures later.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Detachment of the retina
A separation of the two layers by trauma, vascular 
disease, metabolic disorders, and aging results in the 
detachment of the retina. Retinal detachment affects 
the viability of the sensory retina and can be corrected 
by laser surgery. 

The clinical signiﬁcance of the detachment of the 
nonsensory retinal pigmented epithelium from the 
sensory retina is highlighted by the following func-
tions of the pigmented epithelium: 

1. The transport of nutrients from the choroidal 
blood vessels to the outer layers of the sensory retina.
2. The removal of metabolic waste products from 

the sensory retina.

3.  Active  phagocytosis  and  recycling  of  photo-
receptor disks shed from the outer segment of the 
cones and rods. 

4. The synthesis of basal lamina components of 
Bruch’s membrane to which the retinal pigmented 
epithelium is ﬁrmly attached. 

5. It  is essential for the formation of the photopig-
ment rhodopsin because it regenerates the bleached 
photopigment  by  converting  all-trans  retinol  into 
retinal,  which  is  returned  to  the  photoreceptor  by 
interstitial retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a major 
protein in the interphotoreceptor matrix (see Figure 
9-15).

Cell layers of the retina
Four cell groups are found in the sensory retina (see 
Figure 9-14): 

1. The photoreceptor neurons, rods and cones. 
2. The conducting neurons, bipolar and ganglion 

cells. 

3. The association neurons, horizontal and ama-

crine cells. 

4. The supporting neuroglial cells, Müller cells.

Photoreceptor neurons: Rods and cones
Rods (see Figure 9-15) and cones (Figure 9-16) oc-
cupy speciﬁc regions in the sensory retina. Cones are 
predominant in the fovea centralis and perceive color 
and detail. Rods are concentrated at the periphery of 
the fovea and function in peripheral and dim light 
vision.

Both rods and cones are elongated cells with speciﬁc 
structural and functional polarity. They consist of two 
major segments: 

1. An outer segment.
2. An inner segment. 
The outer segment contains stacks of ﬂat mem-
branous disks harboring a photopigment. The disks 
are infoldings of the plasma membrane that pinch 
off as they move away from the modiﬁed cilium, the 
outer-inner segment connecting region.

The various components of the disks are synthe-

•  The retina derives from the neuroectoderm and represents an extension of 
the brain. The retina  is a stratiﬁed layer of nervous cells formed by two layers: 
(1) the outer retinal pigmented epithelium and (2) the inner sensory retina.
•  The nonsensory retinal pigmented epithelium is a simple cuboidal

•  The sensory retina spans from the margin of the optic disk posteriorly to 
the ciliary epithelium anteriorly. 
•  The optic disk includes the optic papilla, formed by protruding nerve ﬁbers 
passing from the retina into the optic nerve. The optic papilla lacks photorecep-

phate  (ATP),  the  Golgi  apparatus,  and  rough  and 
smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The modiﬁed cilium 
consists of nine peripheral microtubule doublets but 
lacks the central pair of microtubules. The terminal 
portion of the photoreceptors is equivalent to an axon 
forming synaptic contacts with cytoplasmic processes, 
neurites, of  bipolar cells and horizontal cells.

There  are  three  signiﬁcant  differences  between 

rods and cones: 

1. The outer segment is cylindrical in the rods and 

conically shaped in the cones.

2. The  rods  terminate  in  a  small  knob  or  rod 
spherule,  which  contacts  dendrites  of  bipolar  cells 
and neurites of horizontal cells. The cones end in a 
thicker cone pedicle. The cone pedicle also synapses 
with bipolar and horizontal cells. The synaptic ending 
of cones and rods, spherules and pedicles, contains a 
synaptic ribbon surrounded by synaptic vesicles (see 
Box 9-F). In addition, gap junctions are present be-
tween the terminals of rods and cones. This cone–rod 
coupling transmits dim light conditions under which 
only rod photoreceptors are active.

3.  Rods  contain  the  photopigment  rhodopsin
(Figure  9-17).  Cones  contain  a  similar  pigment 
called  iodopsin.  Rhodopsin  operates  during  night 
vision.  Iodopsin  perceives  detail  and  discriminates 
color (blue, green, and red). Rhodopsin and iodopsin 
are transmembrane proteins bound to the prosthetic 
group 11-cis-retinal. The protein lacking the pros-

observed in the photomicrograph are represented in the adjacent 
diagram. The synapses between the cells of each layer of the retina 
are also illustrated.  
  Radial branches from blood vessels (arteries and veins), located 
on the retinal surface, are interconnected by capillary beds 
present in the inner layers of the retina. Retinal capillary beds are 
lined by endothelial cells linked by tight junctions creating an 
internal blood-retinal barrier. An external retinal barrier is 
formed by tight junctions linking the cells of the pigmented 
epithelium.
  Note that the nuclei of rods and cones are present in the outer 
nuclear layer.

    The axons of the cones and rods project into the outer plexiform

   Nuclei of the bipolar cells contribute to the inner nuclear layer.

cells in the inner plexiform layer.
   Axons of the ganglion cells become part of the optic nerve.
   Müller cells span most of the retina. The inner limiting

the inner nuclear layer.
   The outer limiting membrane corresponds to junctional

cells.

 There are three different photopigments in cones 
with different light absorbance and sensitive to  blue

retinal  to  activated  all-trans-retinal  is  identical  in 
rods and cones.

The modified cilium connects the inner segment of the photoreceptor 
cell (the site of synthesis of proteins and other molecules) to the outer

mechanism (see Cytoskeleton in Chapter 1, Epithelium) uses 
microtubule-based molecular motors (kinesins and cytoplasmic dyneins) 
to transport proteins, vesicles, and other materials from the inner segment 
to the outer segment. The modified cilium facilitates the delivery of 
molecules from a proximal site of synthesis to a distal site of assembly.

Older disks of the rods are shed and phagocytosed

Photopigment regeneration

The bleached photopigment consists of opsin and all-trans retinol (see Figure 9-17). 
Regeneration of the photopigment consists of the enzymatic conversion within the 
pigmented epithelium of retinol back to 11-cis retinal.  
    Photoreceptors lack the required enzymes. IRBP carries all-trans retinol produced 
by bleaching to the pigmented epithelial cells, where it is converted to 11-cis retinal, 
and returns 11-cis retinal back to the photoreceptor.

of bipolar cells can be distinguished (Figure 9-18): 

1. Rod bipolar cells, linked to rod spherules. 
2.  Cone  bipolar  cells,  linked  to  cone  pedicles. 

Cone bipolar cells consist of two major classes:

1. The midget cone bipolar cell.
2. The diffuse cone bipolar cell. 
Dendrites of the diffuse cone bipolar cells branch 
within the outer plexiform layer and contact several 
cone pedicles. On the opposite pole, the axon of a 
diffuse bipolar cell projects into the inner plexiform 

layer and contacts the dendrites of ganglion cells.

Midget cone bipolar cells synapse with a single 
cone pedicle and a single axon that contacts a single 
ganglion cell. 

Essentially, midget bipolar cells link a single cone 
to an optic nerve ﬁber. In contrast, diffuse bipolar 
cells have wider input and output pathways. The 
nuclei  of  the  bipolar  cells  form  part  of  the  inner 
nuclear layer of the retina.

Figure 9-17. Visual pigment: Rhodopsin

Photoreceptors respond to light through a process called bleaching. During 
bleaching, the photopigment rhodopsin absorbs a photon and changes chemically 
into another component less sensitive to light. 
   Most sensory receptors are depolarized in response to a stimulus and release 
neurotransmitters. However, when a  photoreceptor is activated by light, the plasma 
membrane becomes hyperpolarized and the release of neurotransmitters stops. 
Hyperpolarization is caused by shutting off the inflow of ions to the photoreceptor.

Rhodopsin is a visual pigment present in the 
membrane of the disks of the outer segments in 
rods and cones.
    Rhodopsin consists of two components: (1) 
opsin and (2) the chromophore retinal (a 
derivative of vitamin A). Opsin determines which 
light wavelength will be absorbed by retinal. 
When light strikes rhodopsin, 11-cis-retinal is 
isomerized into all-trans-retinal and rhodopsin 
changes its conformation resulting in bleaching. 
This change results in the activation of a second 
membrane-bound signal-coupling protein, called 
transducin. Transducin is a member of the 
G-protein family.
    Transducin, in turn, activates cGMP 
phosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase 
breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
(cGMP) into guanosine monophosphate (GMP). 
The breakdown of cGMP leads to the closing 
of gated Na+ channels, and entry of Na+ into 
the photoreceptor cell is prevented.
   Consequently, electronegativity increases 
inside the plasma membrane and causes 
hyperpolarization of the entire rod plasma 
membrane and cease neurotransmitter release.

         After light stimulation, rhodopsin disassembles into opsin and retinal, a process known as 
7
bleaching. 11-trans-retinal is enzymatically converted by cells of the pigmented epithelium 
into all-cis-retinal.  Then, 11-cis-retinal is transported back by interstitial retinoid-binding 
protein to the photoreceptor where it recombines with opsin and rhodopsin molecules are 
regenerated. 
     While rhodopsin regeneration is in progress, membrane permeability to Na+ returns to 
normal as cGMP is also synthesized and opens the gated  Na+ channel.

 Box 9-F  | Synaptic ribbon 

Bipolar cells

•  The synaptic ribbon of the ribbon synapse is a presynaptic photoreceptor 
axon terminal structure surrounded by numerous synaptic vesicles containing 
neurotransmitters. Each presynaptic site houses up to 100 ribbons.
•  Ribbon synapses are specialized for maintaining the rapid release of neu-
rotransmitters contained in synaptic vesicles for extended periods of time.
•  Vesicles can be tethered to the ribbon or free (for delayed release) or close to 
the presynaptic plasma membrane (for immediate release). 
•  A property of the synaptic ribbon is the fast trafﬁcking and release of neu-
rotransmitters. Ribbon synapses of photoreceptors and bipolar cells can release 
hundreds of vesicles per second in a calcium-dependent manner. The kinesin 
motor protein KIF3A transports synaptic vesicles from the ribbon to the docking 
presynaptic site (where voltage gated L-type calcium channels are located) for 
release.
•  Synaptic ribbons are seen in: (1) photoreceptor synaptic terminals connecting 
with bipolar and horizontal cell terminals (outer plexiform layer), and (2) be-
tween bipolar cells and either ganglion cells or amarcrine cells (inner plexiform 
layer). Ribbon synapses are also seen in hair cells (inner ear) and pinealocytes 
(pineal gland). 
•  The major component of the ribbon synapse scaffold are aggregates of RIB-
EYE protein subunits, each with RIBEYE(A) and RIBEYE(B) domains.  

 Box 9-G  |  Retinitis pigmentosa

•  Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) comprises a number of inherited defects of the 
retina causing blindness. The ﬁrst indication of RP is night blindness caused 
by the degeneration of rod photoreceptor cells. Blood supply to the retina 
decreases and a pigment is observed on the retinal surface (hence the name 
retinitis pigmentosa).
•  RP genes are located on the X chromosome and chromosome 3. The gene 
for the visual pigment rhodopsin also maps in the same chromosome 3 region. 
Mutations in the rhodopsin gene cause RP.  Peripherin, a protein component of 
rods, is encoded by a gene of the RP family on chromosome 6.

Retina

photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are 
melanopsin-producing  ganglion  cells. They  are 
involved in adjusting the internal circadian clock to 
light and sleep.

Association neurons: Horizontal and amacrine cells
Horizontal cells are retinal neurons forming a net-
work beneath the photoreceptors. They are involved 
in contrast signaling by averaging visual activity over 
space  and  time.  Amacrine  cells  are  interneurons 
located in the inner plexiform layer of the retina, at 
a site where bipolar cells and ganglion cells synapse. 
Horizontal and amacrine cells do not have axons 
or dendrites, only neuritic processes conducting in 
both  directions. The  nuclei  of  the  horizontal  and 
amacrine cells contribute to the inner nuclear layer. 
Horizontal  cells  give  rise  to  neurites  ending  on 
cone pedicles. A single branching  neurite synapses 
with both rod spherules and cone pedicles (see Figure 
9-18). These  neuritic  synapses  occur  in  the  outer 
plexiform layer of the retina. This neurite  and axonal 
distribution indicates that horizontal cells integrate 
cones and rods of adjacent areas of the retina.

Amacrine  cells  are  found  at  the  inner  edge  of 
the inner nuclear layer. They have a single neuritic 
process that branches to link the axonal terminals of  
the bipolar cells and the dendritic branches of the 
ganglion cells (Figure 9-19).

The nuclei of Müller cells are located in the inner 
nuclear layer. The cytoplasmic processes extend to

Consequently, the outer nuclear

close association with the choriocapillaris (wet 
AMD).  Damage to the macula occurs rapidly 
and painless vision loss occurs with either form 
of AMD. The greatest risk factor is age (over age 
60). One of the most common early signs of dry 
AMD is drusen.

the outer and inner limiting membrane.  The inner 
limiting membrane represents the basal lamina of the 
Müller cells and serves to separate the retina from 
the vitreous body.

The cytoplasmic processes of Müller cells ﬁll the 
spaces  between  photoreceptors  and  bipolar  and 
ganglion  cells.  At  the  outer  segment  photorecep-
tor contact sites, a zonula adherens and microvilli 
extending from Müller cells stabilize the association 
between neuronal photoreceptors and glial Müller 
cells. In addition to glial Müller cells, microglial cells 
are present in all layers.

Fovea centralis and optic disk
The fovea centralis, surrounded by the macula lutea 
(Figures 9-20 and 9-21), is a specialized area of the 
retina for accurate vision under normal and dim il-

lumination. The optic disk, which includes the optic 
papilla, is not suitable for vision.

The fovea centralis is located on the temporal side 
of the optic disk. This area contains abundant cones 
but lacks rods and capillaries. The cones synapse with 
the bipolar cells, both oriented at an angle around the 
margins of the fovea. This histologic feature enables 
free access of light to the photoreceptors. The macula 
lutea  is  characterized  by  a  yellow  pigment  (lutein 
and zeaxanthin) in the inner layers surrounding the 
shallow fovea.

The exit site from the retina of axons derived from 
ganglion cells is represented by the optic disk. The 
optic disk includes:

1. The optic papilla, a protrusion formed by the 

axons entering the optic nerve. 

2. The lamina cribrosa of the sclera, pierced by the

Retinal blood vessels can be visualized with an 
ophthalmoscope or by a fluorescein angiography. When 
intraocular pressure increases, the disk of the optic nerve 
appears concave. The disk becomes swollen (papilledema) 
and the veins are dilated when intracranial pressure increases.
    Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a valuable test that 
provides information about the conditions of the retina. FA is 
performed by injecting a sodium-based fluorescent dye into an 
arm vein.  The dye appears in the blood vessels of the retina in 
about 10 to 15 seconds.  As the dye travels through the retinal 
blood vessels, a special retinal camera records images. The 
dye may reveal abnormally leaking blood vessels or the 
inability of the dye to get through blocked blood vessels. Note 
that veins are typically larger in diameter than arteries. 

Optic disk 

Blood vessel

Optic nerve

The axons of the ganglion cells turn into the optic nerve at 
the optic disk, which lacks photoreceptors and corresponds 
to the blind spot of the retina.
    The optic disk has a central depresion, the optic cup, that 
is pale in comparison with the surrounding nerve fibers. A 
loss of nerve fibers in glaucoma results in an increase in the 
optic cup area.

at the edges of the optic disk, which represents the 
“blind spot” of the retina. The central artery and vein 
of the retina pass through the optic disk.

The eyelids, conjunctiva, and the lacrimal glands
The anterior portion of the eyeball is protected by 
the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the ﬂuid produced 
by the lacrimal gland.

Each eyelid consists of two portions (Figure 9-22): 
1. An outer cutaneous portion  lined by a stratiﬁed 
squamous  epidermis  overlying  a  loose  connective 
tissue dermis and skeletal muscle (orbicularis oculi 
muscle).

2. An inner conjunctival portion, lined by a thin 

mucous membrane, the conjunctiva. 

The cutaneous portion contains several skin ap-

pendages: 

1. Sweat and sebaceous glands.
2. Three to four rows of stiff hairs, the eyelashes, 
at the eyelid margins. Eyelashes are associated with 
modiﬁed sweat glands known as the glands of Moll.
Facing the conjunctival lining is the tarsal plate, a 
ﬁbroelastic dense connective tissue containing large 
sebaceous tarsal glands, also known as meibomian 
glands.  Each tarsal gland opens at the margin of the 
eyelid. The tarsal plate is responsible for the rigidity 
of the eyelids.

The junction between the cutaneous and conjunc-
tival portions is demarcated clinically by the sulcus, a 
gray line located between the ducts of the meibomian 
glands and the eyelashes.

The conjunctiva is continuous with the skin lin-
ing and extends up to the periphery of the cornea. It 
consists of polygonal to columnar stratiﬁed epithelial 
cells with mucus-secreting goblet cells.

   It lines the anterior surface of the 
eyeball up to the limbus (bulbar 
conjunctiva) and the inner surface of the 
eyelid (palpebral conjunctiva).
   Continuous exposure to dust, wind, and 
sun causes pinguecula, a proliferation of 
the subconjunctival connective tissue 
stroma and yellow thickening of the bulbar 
conjunctiva.

ﬁrst  accumulate  in  the  conjunctival  sac  and  then 
exit  into  the  nasal  cavity  through  a  drainage  duct 
(nasolacrimal  duct). Tears  evaporate  in  the  nasal 
cavity but can produce a sniffy nose when excessive 
ﬂuid is produced.

The lacrimal gland (Figure 9-23) is a tubuloacinar 
serous  gland  with  myoepithelial  cells.  It  is  orga-
nized into separate lobes with 12 to 15 independent 
excretory ducts. Tears enter the excretory canaliculi 
through the puncta and reach the nasolacrimal sac 
and duct to eventually drain in the inferior meatus 
within the nasal cavity.

Lacrimal glands receive neural input from:
1. Parasympathetic nerve ﬁbers, originating in the 
pterygopalatine ganglion; acetycholine receptors on 
glandular cells respond to acetylcholine released at 
the nerve terminals.

2. Sympathetic nerve ﬁbers, arising from the su-

perior cervical ganglion.

 Blinking produces gentle compression of the lac-
rimal glands and the release of ﬂuid. Tears keep the 
surface of the conjunctiva and cornea moist and rinse 
off dust particles. Spreading of the mucus secreted 
by the conjunctival epithelial cells, the oily secretion 
derived from the tarsal glands, and the continuous 
blinking  of  the  eyelids  prevent  rapid  evaporation 
of the tear ﬁlm.

lactoferrin; secretory immunoglobulin A; and tear-
speciﬁc prealbumin (see Figure 9-23).

Excess production of tears occurs in response to 
chemical and physical irritants of the conjunctiva, 
high light intensity, and strong emotions. 

A disruption in the production of tears or damage 
to the eyelids results in the drying out of the cornea 
(dry  eye  or  keratoconjunctivitis  sicca),  which  is 
followed by ulceration, perforation, loss of aqueous 
humor, and blindness. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Red eye
A red eye is the most frequent and relatively benign 
ocular alteration. In some cases, a red eye represents 
a  vision-threatening  condition.  A  subconjunctival 
hemorrhage is the cause of acute ocular redness and 
can be produced by trauma, bleeding disorders, hy-
pertension, and treatment with anticoagulants. No 
vision impairment is associated with this disorder.

Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red 
eye. The superﬁcial blood vessels of the conjunctiva 
are dilated and cause edema of the conjunctiva with 
discharge. 

A purulent discharge indicates bacterial infection, 
predominantly  gram-positive  organisms.  A  watery 
discharge  is  observed  in  conjunctivitis  caused  by 
viral infection. 

Ear
The ear consists of three components (Figure 9-24):
1. The external ear, which collects sound and directs 

it down the ear canal to the tympanic membrane. 

2. The  middle  ear,  which  converts  sound  pres-
sure waves into mechanical motion of the tympanic 
membrane.  The motion is in turn transmitted to the 
middle ear ossicles, which reduce the amplitude but 
increase the force of  mechanical motion to overcome 
the resistance offered by the ﬂuid-ﬁlled inner ear.

Sound capture and conduction

Conversion of sound waves into fluid waves 

The sound strikes the tympanic 
membrane, causing it to vibrate.

 The tympanic membrane vibrates and moves the footplate 
of the stapes (via the ossicle bone chain) against the oval 
window. 
   The in-out movement of the oval window produces waves 
of pressure in the fluid-containing inner ear. 
   The tensor tympani and stapedius muscles regulate the 
amount of energy transmitted from the air to the fluid. 

Fluid waves in the perilymph-filled 
scala vestibuli and scala tympani, 
caused by oscillatory movements of 
the stapes against the oval window, 
result in equal but opposite 
movements of the round window.
    Fluid waves are transmitted to the 
endolymph-filled cochlear duct, which 
displaces the basilar membrane and 
stimulates the hair cells.

The neural crest cells give rise to the melanocytes of the stria 
vascularis in the cochlea and the Schwann cells of the 
statoacoustic  ganglion.
The somatic ectoderm gives rise to the otic vesicle 
responsible for the development of the membranous labyrinth 
(the three semicircular ducts, the utricle and saccule, and the 
cochlear duct).
    Neuroepithelial cells are concentrated in three ampullary 
crests, two maculae, and one spiral organ.
    The mesenchyme gives rise to the otic capsule (not shown) 
responsible for the formation of the osseous labyrinth (three 
semicircular canals, vestibule, and cochlea).

Development of the inner ear: otic vesicle

Genes that control hindbrain segmentation or rhombomere 
(Rb) identity, in particular Rb5 and Rb6, as well as genes 
expressed in the neural crest cells of the branchial arches 
control the development of the inner ear.
    Under the influence of fibroblast growth factor-3 (FGF-3) 
secreted by Rb5 and Rb6, the otic placode invaginates to form 
the otic vesicle or otocyst. FGF receptor-3 is detected in hair 
cells and their underlying supporting cells in the organ of Corti.
    Under the influence of the Pax-2 (for paired box-2) gene, the 
otic vesicle elongates to form the dorsal vestibular region and 
ventral cochlear region. The formation of the endolymphatic 
duct is controlled by  FGF-3 secreted by Rb5 and Rb6.
    The semicircular ducts arise from the vestibular region 
under the control of the Prx1 (for periaxin 1) and Prx2 genes.

3. The internal ear, which houses the sensory organs 
for both hearing and balance, transmits mechanical 
vibrations to the ﬂuid (the endolymph) contained 
in the membranous labyrinth and thereby converts 
these  mechanical  vibrations  to  electrical  impulses 
on  the  same  type  of  cell  for  sensory  transduction: 
the hair cell. 

The inner ear has two systems: 
1. The auditory system for the perception of sound 

(hearing).

2. The vestibular system for the perception of  head 

and body motion (balance). 

External ear 
The  auricle  (external  ear  or  pinna)  collects  sound 
waves that are conducted across the external acoustic 
meatus to the tympanic membrane. 

The auricle consists of a core of elastic cartilage 
surrounded by skin with hair follicles and sebaceous 
glands.

The external acoustic meatus is a passage extending 
from the auricle to the eardrum or tympanic mem-
brane. The outer one third of this passage is cartilage; 
the inner two thirds is part of the temporal bone. 

Skin lines the cartilage and the bone surfaces. A 

characteristic feature of this skin lining is the tubular 
coiled  apocrine  glands  secreting  a  brown  product 
called cerumen. Cerumen waterproofs the skin and 
protects the external acoustic meatus from exogenous 
agents such as insects.

Middle ear
 The middle ear, or tympanic cavity, is  an air-ﬁlled 
space in the temporal bone interposed between the 
tympanic  membrane  and  the  structures  contained 
in the inner ear. The main function of the middle 
ear is the transmission of sound from the tympanic 
membrane to the ﬂuid-ﬁlled structures of the inner ear.
Sound  transmission  is  carried  out  by  the  audi-
tory  or  bony  ossicles  (malleus,  incus,  and  stapes) 
organized in a chainlike fashion by interconnecting 
small ligaments. In this chain, the arm of the mal-
leus is attached to the tympanic membrane at one 
end; at the other end, the footplate of the stapes is 
applied to the oval window (fenestra vestibuli), an 
opening of the bony labyrinth. The tensor tympani 
(innervated by the trigeminal nerve [cranial nerve V]) 
and stapedius muscles (innervated by the facial nerve 
[cranial nerve VII]) keep the three auditory ossicles 
functionally linked.

   The ductulus reuniens connects the saccule to the blind

The bony ossicles have two roles: 
1.  They modulate the movement of the tympanic 

membrane. 

2.  They  apply  force  to  the  oval  window,  thus 

amplifying the incoming sound waves. 

Otosclerosis and otitis media affect the movements 

of the ossicles, conditions leading to hearing loss.

The tympanic cavity (also called the tubotympanic 
recess or sulcus) is lined by a squamous-to-cuboidal 
epithelium and lacks glands in the supporting con-
nective tissue. 

The tympanic membrane has an oval shape with 
a conical depression near the center caused by the 
attachment of the arm of the malleus. Two differently 
oriented layers of collagen ﬁbers form the core of the 
membrane, and the two sides of the membrane are 
lined by a simple squamous-to-cuboidal epithelium. 
The auditory or eustachian tube links the middle 
ear with the nasopharynx. Adjacent to the tympanic 
cavity,  the  tube  is  formed  by  the  temporal  bone.  
Elastic cartilage continues the bony portion of the 
tube, which then changes into hyaline cartilage near 
the nasopharynx opening. 

A ciliated epithelium with regional variations (low 
columnar-to-pseudostratiﬁed near the nasopharynx) 
and with mucus-secreting glands lines the bony and 
cartilaginous segments of the tube.  

The  role  of  the  auditory  tube  is  to  maintain  a 
pressure balance between the tympanic cavity and 
the external environment.

Defects  in  middle  ear  development  include  the 
absence of structural elements, such as the tympanic
ring, which supports the tympanic membrane and the 
ossicles. The tympanic ring is derived from mesen-
chyme of the ﬁrst pharyngeal arch (malleus and incus) 
and second pharyngeal arch (stapes), the middle ear 
muscles, and the tubotympanic recess.

Inner ear: Development of the inner ear
The inner ear and associated cranial ganglion neurons 
derive from an otic placode on the surface of the head. 
The placode invaginates and forms a hollow mass of 
cells called the otic vesicle, or otocyst (Figure 9-25).  
Neural crest cells migrate out of the hindbrain and 
distribute  around  the  otic  vesicle. The  otic  vesicle 
elongates, forming the dorsal vestibular region and

The endolymphatic duct derives from an invagina-
tion of the otocyst, regulated by ﬁbroblast growth 
factor-3, secreted by cells in rhombomeres 5 and 6. A 
total of seven rhombomeres, called neuromeres, also 
provide signals for the development of the hindbrain. 
Two  of  the  semicircular  ducts  derive  from  the 
vestibular  region  and  develop  under  the  control 
of the Prx1 (for periaxin 1) and Prx2 genes.  Note 
that the auditory (cochlea) and  vestibular portions 
(semicircular canals) are under separate genetic control 
(Pax-2 and Prx genes, respectively).

Figure  9-25  provides  the  road  mapping  of  the 
different portions of the inner ear derived from the 
otic vesicle. 

General structure of the inner ear
The inner ear occupies the osseous labyrinth within 
the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The osseous 
labyrinth contains the membranous labyrinth (Figure 
9-26), a structure that houses both the vestibular and 
auditory systems. 

The vestibular system consists of two components:
1. Two sacs (the utricle and saccule, also called 

otolith organs).

2. Three semicircular canals (superior, horizontal, 

and posterior) arising from the utricle. 

The  auditory  system  consists  of  the  cochlear 
duct, lodged in a spiral bony canal anterior to the 
vestibular system.

The membranous labyrinth contains endolymph, 
a ﬂuid with a high concentration of K+ and a low 
concentration of Na+. Perilymph (with a high Na+
and low K+ content) is present between the membra-
nous labyrinth and the walls of the osseous labyrinth 
(Figure 9-27).

Vestibular system
The semicircular canals respond to rotational  move-
ments of the head and  body (angular accelerations).  
The otolith organs (saccule and utricle) respond 
to translational movements (gravity and linear ac-
celeration). 

Sensory cells in the vestibular organ are innervated 
by  afferent  ﬁbers  of  the  vestibular  branch  of  the 
vestibulocochlear  nerve  (cranial  nerve  VIII).  The 
labyrinthine artery, a branch of the anterior inferior 
cerebellar artery, supplies blood to the labyrinth. The 
stylomastoid artery supplies blood to the semicircular 
canals. 

Semicircular canals
The  semicircular  ducts  are  contained  within  the 
osseous  labyrinth.  The  three  ducts  are  connected

Crista

Osseous labyrinth

Cristae are important for sensing the position of 
the head and angular acceleration.  Movement of the 
head results in the displacement of the endolymph and 
the cupula. This displacement  determines the bending 
of the kinocilium and stereocilia of the hair cells. 
   A force directing the stereocilia toward the kinocilium 
determines an increase in the activity of the vestibular 
nerve innervating the cells. When a force directs the 
kinocilium away from the stereocilia, the activity in the 
vestibular nerve decreases.

to  the  utricle.  Ducts  derived  from  the  utricle  and 
saccule join to form the endolymphatic duct. The 
endolymphatic duct ends in a small dilation called 
the endolymphatic sac, located between the layers 
of the meninges. 

Small dilations, ampullae, are present at the semi-
circular duct–utricle connection sites. Each ampulla 
has a prominent ridge called the crista ampullaris. 
Cristae are important for sensing the position of the 
head and angular acceleration.

The crista ampullaris (Figure 9-28) consists of a 
sensory  epithelium  covered  by  a  gelatinous  mass 
called the cupula. The cupula contains otogelin, a 
glycoprotein  anchoring  the  cupula  to  the  sensory 
epithelium. 

The sensory epithelium consists of two cell types 

(see Figure 9-28): 
1. The hair cells.
2. The supporting cells. 
Like all other sensory receptors, hair cells respond

Figure 9-29. Structure of the macula of the saccule and utricle

The maculae are sensory receptor areas located in the wall of the 
saccule and utricle.
    They are concerned with the detection of directional movement 
of the head. The position of the macula in the utricle is horizontal 
and it is vertical in the saccule.

A single layer of supportive cells associated with the basal lamina 
houses two types of sensory cells: types I and II hair cells. A long 
single kinocilium and 50 to 60 stereocilia project from the apical 
surface of the hair cells. 

Otoliths contain calcium carbonate. Changes 
in the position of the head  cause a shift in the 
position of the otolithic membrane (including 
the otoliths) and endolymph. 
    This movement displaces the underlying 
kinocilium and stereocilia.

to sub-millisecond timescale.

The basal surface of the supporting cells is attached 
to a basal lamina. In contrast, the hair cells occupy 
a recess in the apical region of the supporting cells 
and do not reach the basal lamina. 

The apical domain of the hair cells contains 60 
to 100 hairlike specialized stereocilia and a single 
kinocilium. Stereocilia are supported by an actin-
containing cuticular plate. The free ends of both 
stereocilia and kinocilia are embedded in the cupula. 

The  cupula  attaches  to  the  roof  and  walls  of  the 
ampulla and acts like a partition of the lumen of the 
ampulla (see Figure 9-28).

 The crista ampullaris has two types of hair cells:
1. Type I hair cells.
2. Type II hair cells. 
Both cell types are essentially similar in their in-
ternal structure, but differences exist in their shape 
and innervation:

neurotransmitters  aspartate  and  glutamate,  enter 
the spaces separating the supporting cells and form

Figure 9-30. Organization of the macula

Sensory epithelium of the macula

This epithelium consists of types I and II hair cells embedded in 
supporting cells touching the basal lamina.
    In vivo, kinocilia and stereocilia, extending from the surface of 
the hair cells, are coated by the otolithic (or statoconial) 
membrane containing otoconia (Greek “ear dust”). 
    Otoconia are displaced by the endolymph during 
forward-backward and upward-downward movements of the head 
(linear acceleration). 
   The sensory epithelium of the macula in the otolithic organs 

(saccule and utricle) does not respond to head rotation.
   The hair cells of the macula are polarized: The kinocilium is 
oriented with respect to an imaginary line called the striola, which 
divides the hair cells into two opposite fields. 
   In the utricule, the kinocilium faces the striola. In the saccule, the 
kinocilium faces away from the striola.
   This orientation determines which population of hair cells will  
displace their hair bundles in response to a specific movement of the 
head.

a calyx-like network embracing the rounded basal 
domain of the type I hair cell. The cytoplasm displays 
synaptic ribbons and associated vesicles (similar to 
those found in the sensory retina). 

2. The nerve endings in contact with the cylindrical 
type II hair cell do not form a basal calyx. Instead, 
simple terminal boutons can be visualized.

In  addition  to  afferent  nerves,  both  type  I  and 
type II hair cells receive efferent nerve terminals and 
have synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmit-
ter acetylcholine. Efferent nerve ﬁbers control the 
sensitivity of the sensory receptor cells.

Supporting cells and hair cells  are associated with 
each other by apical junctional complexes. Character-
istic features of the supporting cells are an apical dense 
terminal web and the presence of short microvilli. 
Supporting cells lack stereocilia and kinocilia, two 
features typical of hair cells.

Otolithic organs: Utricle and saccule
The utricle and saccule display a sensory epithelium 
called a macula (Figures 9-29 and 9-30). Small duct-
ules derived from the utricle and saccule join to form 
the endolymphatic duct ending in the endolymphatic

sac. The ductus reuniens links the saccule to the base 
of the membranous cochlear duct.

Like the sensory epithelium of the crista ampullaris 
in the semicircular canals, the macula contains hair 
cells and supporting cells. The characteristics of the 
hair cells of the macula are described in Figure 9-29. 
Note that the macula is covered by a gelatinous sub-
stance, the otolithic membrane, containing calcium 
carbonate–protein complexes forming small crystals 
called otoliths. Otoliths are not present in the cupula 
overlying the hairs of the crista ampullaris. 

How do hair cells of the crista ampullaris of the 
semicircular ducts and the maculae of the utricle and 
saccule work? 

When  the  position  of  the  cupula  and  otolithic 
membrane change in response to movements of the 
endolymph, it causes displacement of the stereocilia 
and kinocilium of the hair cells (see bottom of Figure 
9-29). 

When stereocilia move toward the kinocilium, the 
plasma membrane of the hair cells depolarizes and 
the afferent nerve ﬁbers are stimulated (excitation). 
When  stereocilia  are  deﬂected  away  from  the 
kinocilium, the hair cell hyperpolarizes and afferent 
nerve ﬁbers are not stimulated (inhibition).

One  last  important  point: The  hair  cells  of  the 
macula are polarized (see Figure 9-30). The kino-
cilium is oriented with respect to an imaginary line 
called the striola, which divides the population of 
hair cells into two opposite ﬁelds:

1.  In  the  utricule,  the  kinocilium  faces  toward 

the striola.

2. In the saccule, the kinocilium faces away from 

the striola.

These  opposite  orientations  determine  which 
population of hair cells will  displace their hair bundles 
in response to a speciﬁc movement of the head. 

Again, remember that the cristae ampullares of the 
semicircular ducts respond to rotational movements 
of the head and body (angular acceleration), whereas 

the maculae of the utricle and saccule respond to trans-
lational movements (gravity and linear acceleration).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Ménière’s disease
Secretory cells in the membranous labyrinth and the 
endolymphatic sac maintain the ionic balance between 
endolymph and perilymph (see Figure 9-36). 

An increase in the volume of endolymph is the 
cause of Ménière’s disease, which is characterized by 
vertigo  (illusion  of  rotational  movement  in  space), 
nausea, positional nystagmus (involuntary rhythmic 
oscillation of the eyes), vomiting, and ringing in the 
ears (tinnitus).

Cochlea
The cochlear duct is a membranous coiled duct in-
serted in the bony cochlea. It consists of an apex and a 
base. The coiled duct makes about two and two-thirds 
turns with a total length of 34 mm.

The cochlea has three spiraling chambers (Figures 

9-31 and 9-32): 

1. The cochlear duct (also called the scala media) 
represents the central chamber and contains endo-
lymph. 

2. Above the cochlear duct is the scala vestibuli, 

starting at the oval window. 

3. Below the cochlear duct is the scala tympani, 

ending at the round window. 

The  scalae  vestibuli  and  tympani  are  ﬁlled  with 
perilymph and communicate at the helicotrema at 
the apex of the cochlea (Figure 9-33).

In cross section, the boundaries of the scala media 

are:

1. The basilar membrane at the bottom.
2. The vestibular or Reissner’s membrane above,
3. The stria vascularis externally. 
The  cells  and  capillaries  of  the  stria  vascularis 
produce endolymph. The stria vascularis is lined by 
a pseudostratiﬁed epithelium consisting of basal cells 
(of neural crest or mesoderm origin), intermediate 
cells (melanocyte-like cells of neural crest origin) and 
marginal cells (of  epithelial cell origin). 

Marginal cells contain an ATPase K+ pump involved 
in K+ release into the endolymph. Basal cells are linked 
to intermediate cells by gap junctions. Intermediate 
cells harbor Kcnj10, a potassium inwardly rectifying 
channel, subfamily J, member 10, that generates an 
endocochlear potential and membrane voltage and 
produces endolymph.  The recycling of K+ions from 
the hair cells back into the endolymph maintains the 
appropriate high K+ concentration in the endolymph 
ﬂuid, critical for normal hair cell function.

The spiraling bony core of the cochlea is the mo-
diolus. On the inner side, the spiral osseous lamina 
projects outward from the modiolus to join the basilar 
membrane. On the external side, the basilar membrane 
is continuous with the spiral ligament.

The cochlea (Greek kochlias, spiral-shelled snail) is a spiral canal that 
winds more than two and a half times around a central bony axis, the 
modiolus. Within the bony modiolus is the cochlear (spiral) ganglion, 
spiraling around the inner side of the cochlea. The ganglion contains 
bipolar neurons: (1) The peripheral processes innervate the hair cells. 
(2) The central processes enter the core of the modiolus, where they 
form the cochlear nerve (the cochlear division of cranial nerve VIII). 
   The membranous portion of the cochlea contains the cochlear duct, 
or scala media. The cochlear duct spans the bony labyrinth dividing it 
into two separate canals: (1) the scala vestibuli and (2) the scala 
tympani. 
   The vestibular membrane (Reissner’s membrane) and the basilar 
membrane, two membranes limiting the cochlear duct, separate the 

endolymph-filled cochlear duct from the perilymph-filled scala vestibuli 
and scala tympani. 
   The lateral wall of the cochlear partition is the stria vascularis, a 
highly vascular tissue that covers a portion of the bony labyrinth and is 
responsible for the production and maintenance of the unique 
composition of the endolymph.
   The cochlear duct does not extend to the apex or cupula of the 
cochlea but leaves a small opening of communication between the 
scala vestibuli and scala tympani at the apex, the helicotrema (see 
Figure 9-33). At the base of the cochlea, the stapes on the oval 
window and the membrane of the round window (not shown) 
separate the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, respectively, from 
the middle ear cavity.

Organ of Corti       
The  organ  of  Corti  is  the  sensory  component  of 
the cochlea. 

In simple terms, imagine the organ of Corti consist-
ing of a small tunnel (Figure 9-34). The tiny tunnel is 
ﬂanked by a single row of inner hair cells (IHCs) on 
the side pointing to the modiolus, and three rows of 
outer hair cells (OHCs) on the other side, pointing 
to the stria vascularis. Outer and inner pillar cells 
form the walls of the tunnels. 

OHCs and  IHCs, supported  by outer and inner 
phalangeal cells respectively, extend from the base 
to the apex of the cochlea. The tectorial membrane 
extends outward from the spiral limbus and covers 
in part the organ of Corti. 

IHCs  are  the  sensory  receptors  sending  most 
of the neural signals to the central nervous system. 
OHCs have the mechanical role of amplifying the 
displacement of the basilar membrane in response to 
sound waves. The basilar membrane moves the hair 
cells toward and away from the tectorial membrane. 
A relevant component of the hair cells is the hair 
bundle located at their apical domain. A hair bundle 
is formed by 50 to 150 stereocilia in a long-to-short 
gradient arrangement. No kinocilium is present in 
the hair bundle of the cochlea. 

Molecular and mechanical aspects of the hearing 
process
Each member of the hair bundle, the stereocilium, 
consists of a core of actin ﬁlaments (Figure 9-35). The 
tip of the actin bundle is the site where actin monomers 
are added under control of myosin XVa in association 
with the protein whirlin. Defects in myosin Va and 
whirlin cause abnormally short stereocilia. 

At the base, the actin bundle is stabilized by the 
protein radixin. Stereocilia within a hair bundle are 
interconnected by extracellular ﬁlaments (interciliary 
links). Side links (myosin VIIa and associated pro-
teins) connect stereocilia along their shafts. Tip links 
(cadherin 23) extend from the tip of a stereocilium 
to the side of the taller adjacent stereocilium. The 
tension of the tip link is controlled by myosin 1c. 

Defects  in  interciliary  links  result  in  Usher’s 
syndrome, characterized by disorganization of hair 
bundles leading to sensorineural deafness of cochlear 
origin  combined  with  retinitis  pigmentosa  (loss  of 
vision).  

Interciliary  links  regulate  the  opening  and  clos-
ing of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) ion 
channels, permeable to Ca2+. Deﬂection of the hair 
bundle toward the taller stereocilia side opens the MET 
channels; displacements in the opposite direction close

Deflections of the hair bundle are caused by sound 
vibrations initiated in each eardrum, conducted 
through the three ossicles in the middle ear, and 
transmitted within the cochlea as pressure waves. The 
end result is the displacement of the basilar 
membrane to elicit an electrical response in hair cells. 
    Sound-induced motion of the basilar membrane 
deflects the hair bundles of the hair cells to activate 
mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) ion channels 
represented by transient receptor potential channel 
A1 (TRPA1) linked by an interciliary tip link (for 
example, Ca2+-dependent cadherin 23). The tension 
of the tip link is maintained by myosin 1c. Force 
applied to the interciliary tip link appears to activate 
TRPA1, which becomes permeable to Ca2+. Plasma 
membrane Ca2+-ATPase pumps are present. Side 
links (for example, myosin VIIa) stabilize the cohesion 
of adjacent hair bundles.
    Each hair bundle consists of an F-actin core 
capped by the scaffolding protein whirlin and 
associated myosin XVa. G-actin is added at the tip of 
the stereocilia.

these  channels.  Interciliary  links  ensure  a  uniform 
response of MET channels. MET Ca2+ channels are 
essential for the conversion of a sound stimulus to 
an equivalent electrical signal and frequency tuning. 
The tectorial membrane is an extracellular gel-like 
matrix contacting the stereocilia bundles of the outer 
hair cells. It contains types II, V and IX collagens, 
(cid:95)- and (cid:96)-tectorin proteins and otogelin, also seen in 
the cupula (crista ampullaris) and otolithic membrane 

(maculae). As previously indicated, otogelin is essential 
for the anchoring of the cupula and otolithic mem-
brane to the sensory epithelium. Conversely, otogelin 
appears to be dispensable for the anchoring of  the 
tectorial membrane to the spiral limbus.

  When the basilar membrane and organ of Corti 
are displaced by shear forces (Figure 9-36), the hair 
bundle of OHCs hit the tectorial membrane and the 
rigid stereocilia are deﬂected; stereocilia do not bend.

1      Upward displacement of the basilar membrane 
stimulates the outer hair cells by deflecting their stereocilia 
bundles against the tectorial membrane.  Electrical 
signals are generated. The combined hinge motion of the 
tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane stimulates 
also the inner hair cells. An electromechanical feedback 
is generated.  
    Ion channels at the tip of the stereocilia open. K+ ions 
enter the hair cells, which become depolarized. 
Neurotransmitters released at the basal domain of each 
hair cell depolarize the afferent cochlear nerve fiber.  
Signals are relayed to the brain by the VIII cranial nerve.

K+ is secreted by cells of the stria vascularis into the endolymph.  A 
mutation in the gene encoding a protein of the K+ channel in the 
intermediate cells of the stria vascularis (Kcnj10 gene) determines a 
disruption in the production of endolymph and the degeneration of the 
organ of Corti.  K+ channel proteins are present at the tip of the stereocilia 
of hair cells and regulate the flow of K+ into hair cells to depolarize these 
cells. 

Three major proteins of the gel-like tectorial membrane are 
collagens types II,  V and IX, otogelin, (cid:95)-tectorin, and 
(cid:96)-tectorin. A mutation in the genes encoding otogelin and 
(cid:95)-tectorin causes deafness.

Gap junctions are present on supporting 
phalangeal cells and contain connexin 
26.  Gap junctions recycle  K+ ions back 
to the endolymph of the cochlear duct 
following strimulation of the hair cells. A 
mutation in the connexin 26 gene is 
responsible for human deafness. 

Outer hair cell 

A small number of melanocytes in the stria 
vascularis, derived from the neural crest, are 
required for the strial function. The lack of c-kit 
and stem cell ligand, not observed in the c-kit 
mutant (see the role of c-kit and its ligand during 
hematopoiesis [see Chapter 6], spermatogenesis 
[see Chapter 20], and mast cell development [see 
Chapter 4]), cause deafness (Waardenburg’s 
syndrome in humans).

Keep in mind that rigidity is determined at the tip 
of the stereocilia by a complex group of proteins (see 
Figure 9-35). Most importantly, stereocilia tension 
created by deﬂection opens transduction ion channels.
Deﬂection  of stereocilia toward the tallest stereo-
cilia causes depolarization. Deﬂection of stereocilia to-
ward the shortest stereocilia causes hyperpolarization.
The  spiral  ganglion  is  housed  in  the  modiolus. 
Processes of the bipolar sensory neurons of the spiral 
ganglion extend into the osseous spiral lamina, lose 
their myelin, pierce the basilar membrane, and synapse 
on the basal domain of the inner and outer hair cells. 
There are two types of bipolar sensory neurons in 

the spiral ganglion: 

1. Type I cells (90% to 95%) whose ﬁbers contact 

inner hair cells.

2. Type II cells (5% to 10%) that synapse with 

outer hair cells. 

The neuronal processes of types I and II cells form 
the cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve. 
Olivocochlear  efferent  ﬁbers  run  along  the  basilar 
membrane to contact the inner and outer hair cells. 
Neurons of  the auditory and vestibular ganglia fail 
to develop when the neurogenin 1 gene is deleted.
Two factors play a signiﬁcant role during the hear-

ing process (see Figure 9-36):

1. The high concentration of K+ in the endolymph 
and the high concentration of Na+ in the perilymph 
determine an electrical potential difference. The ion 

concentration  is  regulated  by  the    absorptive  and 
secretory activity of the stria vascularis. 

2. Fluid movement in the scala tympani induces the 
movement of the basilar membrane causing the taller 
stereocilia to be displaced by the tectorial membrane.
As a result, ion channels at the stereocilia tip open 
driving K+ into the cell, which then becomes depolar-
ized. Upon depolarization, an inﬂux of Ca2+ to the 
basal region of the hair cells determines the release of 
neurotransmitters at the hair cell–cochlear nerve ﬁber 
synapse and generation of a stimulus. Note the pres-
ence of ribbon synapses at the base of the hair cells. 
Changes in electrical potential between the peri-
lymph  and  the  hair  cells  occur  in  response  to  the 
magnitude of sound. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Deafness and balance
Cytoskeletal  components  in  the  apical  domain  of 
hair cells are relatively abundant. Hair cells convert 
mechanical input, determined by the deﬂection of 
apical bundles of stereocilia embedded in the tecto-
rial  membrane  and  the  otolithic  membrane  of  the 
cupula, into an electromechanical input leading to 
synaptic transmission.

In the absence of the transcription factor Pou4f3 
(for POU domain, transcription factor 4, class 3), 
hair cells express speciﬁc markers (including uncon-
ventional myosin VI and VIIa), and both hair cells 
and spiral ganglion neurons degenerate.

As previously indicated, the tectorial membrane, 
cupula  and otolithic membrane contain (cid:95)-tectorin,  
(cid:96)-tectorin and otogelin. When the (cid:95)-tectorin- and 
otogelin-encoding genes are mutated, deafness and 
imbalance occur (Figure 9-37).

A mutation  in the gene for connexin 26, a com-
ponent of gap junctions on the surface of supporting 
cells, is responsible for deafness because the recycling 
of  endolymph K+ from the intercellular spaces to 
the stria vascularis is disrupted. Connexin 26 is not 
present in hair cells.  

There are several mouse mutants with a decrease 
in neural crest–derived melanocytes in the stria vas-

cularis. Although the particular role of melanocytes 
in the stria vascularis is not known, a mutation in the 
c-kit gene (encoding the stem cell factor receptor and 
its ligand; see Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis, 
for a discussion of the c-kit gene) affects the function 
of the stria vascularis and the mice are deaf.  

Waardenburg’s syndrome in humans is an autoso-
mal dominant type of congenital deafness associated 
with pigment abnormalities, such as partial albinism,  
and abnormal development of the vestibulocochlear 
ganglion. 

Recall that melanocytes have a common origin in 

the neural crest and are migratory cells.

Sensory Organs: Vision and Hearing

• EYE
The eyeball consists of three tunics (from 
outside to inside): 
  (1) Sclera and cornea.
  (2) Uvea.
  (3) Retina. 
  Three interconnected chambers are inside 
the eye: 

  (1) The anterior chamber (between the 
corneal endothelium and the anterior surface 
of the iris).
  (2) The posterior chamber (between the 
posterior surface of the iris and the lens and 
associated suspensory ligaments of the lens).
  (3) The vitreous cavity (from the lens to the 
retina). 

   Aqueous humor (produced by the ciliary 
body) circulates from the posterior to the 
anterior chambers. Aqueous humor is drained 
from the trabecular meshwork into the canal 
of Schlemm located at the corneal-irideal 
angle.
   The eyeball is protected by the bony orbit, 
the eyelids, conjunctiva, and the lacrimal

apparatus. The ophthalmic artery (a branch of 
the internal carotid artery) provides nutrients to 
the eye and the orbit contents.

•  The components of the eye derive from 
three different sites: 
  (1) The surface ectoderm of the head.
  (2) The lateral neuroectodermal walls of the 
embryonic brain (diencephalon region).
  (3) The mesenchyme. 
  Each optic vesicle, an outpocketing on the 
right and left sides of the diencephalon, be-
comes a two-layered optic cup. 
  The outer layer becomes the pigmented 
epithelium; the inner neural layer becomes 
the retina. 
  The surface of the ectoderm invaginates into 
the optical vesicle forming the future lens. 
  The outer surface of the optic cup differenti-
ates into the vascular choroid coat (which 
gives rise to the ciliary body, ciliary muscle, and 
ciliary processes), the sclera, and the cornea.
  The mesenchyme, extending into the invagi-
nation of the optic cup, forms the vitreous 
component of the eye. 

• Outer tunic: Sclera and cornea. The sclera 
is a thick layer of collagen and elastic ﬁbers 
produced by ﬁbroblasts. The cornea is a 
transparent, avascular, and innervated tissue. It 
consists of ﬁve layers: 
  (1) A stratiﬁed corneal epithelium exposed to 
the environment,
  (2) A supporting membrane or layer of 
Bowman.
  (3) A regularly oriented corneal stroma.
  (4) The membrane of Descemet.
  (5)The corneal endothelium (a simple 
squamous epithelium in contact with aqueous 
humor).

•  Middle tunic: Uvea. The uvea consists of 
three regions: 
  (1) Choroid.
  (2) Ciliary body.
  (3) Iris.
   The choroid consists of three layers: 
  (1) Bruch’s membrane (formed by the basal 
lamina of the pigmented epithelium of the 
retina, the basal lamina of fenestrated capil-
laries corresponding to the choriocapillaris, 
and connective tissue in between, the site of 
deposits of amyloid material called drusen).
  (2) Choriocapillaris (the source of nutrients 
to the outer layers of the retina).
  (3) The choroid stroma (containing mela-
nocytes, blood vessels, and neurons of the 
autonomic nervous system).
   The ciliary body, anterior to the ora serrata, 
consists of two portions: 
  (1) The uveal portion (that includes the 
supraciliaris portion of the choroid; the ciliary 
muscle, which controls the curvature of the 
lens by modifying the length of the suspensory 
ligaments; and fenestrated capillaries). 
  (2) The neuroepithelial portion (which con-
tributes two cell layers to the ciliary epithelium: 
a pigmented cell layer and a nonpigmented 
cell layer, continuous with the sensory retina. 

The apical surfaces of these two layers face 
each other and secrete aqueous humor).
   The iris is a continuation of the ciliary body. 
It has an anterior surface without epithelial 
lining (melanocytes and ﬁbroblasts), and a 
posterior surface lined by a dual layer of pig-
mented cells. The stroma contains myoepithe-
lial cells (dilator pupillae muscle) and smooth 
muscle cells (sphincter pupillae).

•  The lens is a biconvex, transparent, elastic, 
and avascular structure kept in place by zonu-
lar ﬁbers (extending from the ciliary epithelium 
and inserting at the equatorial region of the 
lens capsule). 
  The lens consists of:
  (1) A capsule.
  (2) An epithelium.
  (3) A lens substance (consisting of cortical 
and nuclear lens ﬁbers). 
  Filensin and crystallins ((cid:95), (cid:96), and (cid:97)) are inter-
mediate ﬁlament proteins found in the lens. 
Cataracts, an opacity of the lens, is caused by 
a change in the solubility of these proteins.

•  Accommodation is the process by which 
the lens becomes rounder (to focus the image 
of a nearby object on the retina) and ﬂattens 
(when the image of a distant object is focused 
on the retina).  
   Accommodation involves the participation 
of the ciliary muscle, the ciliary body, and the 
suspensory ligaments.  
  When the ciliary muscle contracts, the ten-
sion of the ligaments is reduced (because the 
ciliary body moves closer to the lens), and the 
lens acquires a spherical shape (close vision).
  When the ciliary muscle relaxes, the tension 
of the ligaments increases (the ciliary body 
moves away from the lens), and the lens 
becomes ﬂat (distant vision). 
   Emmetropia is normal vision. Myopia (or 
nearsightedness) occurs when the eyeball is 
too deep or the curvature of the lens is not 
ﬂat enough for distant vision; the image of a 
distant object forms in front of the retina.
  Hyperopia (or farsightedness) is when the 
eyeball is too shallow and the curvature of the 
lens is too ﬂat; the image of a distant object 
forms behind the retina. Older people become 
farsighted as the lens loses elasticity, a condi-
tion known as presbyopia.

• Inner tunic: Retina. The retina consists of 
two regions: 
  (1) The outer nonsensory retinal pigmented 
epithelium (a single layer of pigmented cuboi-
dal cells extending from the optic disk to the 
ora serrata).
  (2) The inner sensory retina (extending from 
the optic disk to the ciliary epithelium). 
   The separation of these two layers, result-
ing from trauma, vascular disease, metabolic 
disorders, and aging, results in detachment of 
the retina. 
  The pigmented epithelium of the retina is 
essential for the transport of nutrients from 
the choroidal blood vessels to the outer layers 
of the retina, the removal of waste meta-

bolic products from the sensory retina, the 
phagocytosis and recycling of photoreceptor 
disks, and the recycling of the photobleached 
pigment rhodopsin. The basal lamina of the 
pigmented epithelium is a component of 
Bruch’s membrane.
   The sensory retina consists of four cell 
groups: 
  (1) Photorecepor neurons (rods and cones).
  (2) Conducting neurons (bipolar and gan-
glion cells).
  (3) Association neurons (horizontal and 
amacrine cells).
  (4) Supporting neuroglia Müller cells. 
   Cells are distributed in 10 layers summa-
rized in Figure 9-14. 
  There are three distinct nuclear regions: 
  (1) The outer nuclear layer corresponds to 
the nuclei of the photoreceptors.
  (2) The inner nuclear layer corresponds 
to the nuclei of bipolar cells, horizontal, and 
amacrine cells as well as of Müller cells.
  (3) The ganglion layer contains the nuclei 
of the ganglion cells. The plexiform and limit-
ing membranes represent sites of contacts 
among the retinal cells.
   Photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) are 
elongated and consist of two segments: 
  (1) An outer segment, which contains ﬂat 
membranous disks.
 (2) An inner segment, the site of synthesis of 
various cell components. 
  A modiﬁed cilium connects the outer and 
inner segments. It also provides microtubules 
for molecular motor proteins (kinesins and 
cytoplasmic dyneins) to deliver materials to 
the disk assembly site by the mechanism of 
intraciliary transport. 
  The differences between rods and cones are 
the following: 
  (1) the outer segment of the rod is cylindri-
cal; in cones it is conical. 
  (2) Rods terminate in a spherule; cones end 
in a pedicle. Both endings interact with bipolar 
and horizontal cells. 
  (3) Rods contain the photopigment rho-
dopsin (night vision); cones contain a similar 
pigment, iodopsin (color vision).
   Bipolar and ganglion cells are connecting 
neurons receiving impulses from photorecep-
tor cells.
   Horizontal and amacrine cells do not have 
axons or dendrites, only neuritic processes 
conducting in both directions.
   Müller cells are columnar cells that occupy 
the spaces between photoreceptor and bipo-
lar and ganglion cells. Müller cells contact the 
outer segment of the photoreceptors, estab-
lishing zonulae adherentes and microvilli, cor-
responding to the outer limiting membrane. 
The inner limiting membrane represents the 
basal lamina of Müller cells.
  Ribbon synapses, each containing a synaptic 
ribbon, are found in spherules and pedicles 
of the photoreceptor cells and in bipolar cells. 
They are also found in hair cells (inner ear) 
and pinealocytes (pineal gland). 
  A synaptic ribbon is a dense strip located at 
the presynaptic membrane associated with

• The fovea centralis, surrounded by the 
macula lutea, is a specialized area for accurate 
vision. 
  The optic disk (the exit site of axons derived 
from ganglion cells and the passage site of 
blood vessels), including the optic papilla, is 
not suitable for vision (the blind spot of the 
retina). 

•  The eyelids consist of two portions: 
  (1) The outer cutaneous portion.
  (2) The inner conjunctival portion. 
   The cutaneous portion contains sweat and 
sebaceous glands, and eyelashes associated 
with glands of Moll. The tarsal plate (ﬁbroelas-
tic connective tissue) faces the conjunctival 
lining. Large sebaceous glands, called tarsal 
glands or meibomian glands, open at the 
margin of the eyelids. 
  The conjunctiva (polygonal to columnar 
stratiﬁed epithelial lining with mucus-secreting 
cells) is continuous with the skin and ends at 
the margin of the cornea, where it becomes 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium and is continu-
ous with the corneal epithelium.

•  The lacrimal glands are tubuloacinar serous 
glands with myoepithelial cells. Blinking pro-
duces compression of the lacrimal glands and 
the release of ﬂuid (tears).

• EAR
The ear consists of three portions: 
  (1) External ear.
  (2) Middle ear.
  (3) Inner ear.

• The external ear consists of the auricle 
(external ear), which collects sound waves that 
are conducted across the external acoustic 
meatus to the tympanic membrane. 

• The middle ear (or tympanic cavity) is an 
air-ﬁlled space in the temporal bone that con-
tains the auditory or bony ossicles (malleus, 
incus, and stapes). The arm of the malleus is 
attached to the tympanic membrane at one 
end; the footplate of the stapes is applied 
to the oval window, an opening of the bony 
labyrinth. 
  Bony ossicles modulate the movement of 
the tympanic membrane and apply force to 
the oval window (to amplify the incoming 
sound waves). 
  Otitis media and otosclerosis affect the 

movement of the ossicles and can lead to 
hearing loss. 
  The auditory or eustachian tube (elastic carti-
lage changing to hyaline cartilage) links the 
middle ear to the nasopharynx. It maintains a 
pressure balance between the tympanic cavity 
and the external environment.

• The inner ear occupies the osseous 
labyrinth, which contains the membranous 
labyrinth. 
   The membranous labyrinth houses the 
vestibular and auditory systems. The mem-
branous labyrinth contains endolymph (high 
concentration of K+ and low concentration 
of Na+). Perilymph (high concentration of 
Na+ and low concentration of K+) is present 
between the osseous labyrinth and the mem-
branous labyrinth.  

• The vestibular system consists of:
  (1) Two sacs (utricle and saccule).
  (2) Three semicircular canals: superior, hori-
zontal, and posterior, arising from the utricle.
  Ampullae are present at the semicircular 
canal–utricle connection site.
   The endolymphatic duct derives from the 
utricle and saccule and fuses into a single 
duct, which terminates in a small dilation, the

endolymphatic sac, located between the layers 
of the meninges. 
  An increase in the volume of endolymph 
causes Ménière’s disease, characterized by 
vertigo, nausea, positional nystagmus, vomit-
ing, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
   Each ampulla has a crista, an elevation 
covered by sensory epithelium consisting of 
type I and II hair cells and supporting cells, 
topped by the cupula, a gelatinous substance 
surrounded by endolymph. 
  Semicircular canals respond to rotational 
movements of the head and body (angular 
acceleration).

   Hair cells have an apical domain contain-
ing 60 to 100 stereocilia (supported by an 
actin-containing cuticular plate) and a single 
kinocilium. The free ends of the stereocilia and 
kinocilium are embedded in the cupula.
   The maculae of the utricle and saccule 
respond to translational movements (gravity 
and linear acceleration). Maculae consist of a 
sensory epithelium (type I and II hair cells and 
supporting cells) topped by the otolithic mem-
brane, a gelatinous substance similar to cristae, 
except for the presence of otoliths containing 
calcium carbonate. 
   Remember that when the position of the 
cupula and otolithic membrane change in 
response to movements of the endolymph, 
it causes displacement of the stereocilia and 
kinocilium of the hair cells. 
  When stereocilia move toward the kino-
cilium, the plasma membrane of the hair cells 

depolarizes and the afferent nerve ﬁbers are 
stimulated (excitation). 
  When stereocilia are deﬂected away from 
the kinocilium, the hair cell hyperpolarizes 
and afferent nerve ﬁbers are not stimulated 
(inhibition).
  Remember also that the hair cells of the 
macula are polarized. The kinocilium is ori-
ented with respect to an imaginary line called 
the striola, which divides the population of hair 
cells into two opposite ﬁelds:
  (1) In the utricule, the kinocilium faces 
toward the striola.
  (2) In the saccule, the kinocilium faces away 
from the striola.

 • The auditory system consists of the co-
chlea, a coiled duct. 
   The cochlea has three spiraling chambers:
  (1) The cochlear duct (called scala media).
  (2) The scala vesibuli, starting at the oval 
window.
  (3) The scala tympani, ending at the round 
window. 
  The scala vestibuli and scala tympani contain 
perilymph and communicate at the helico-
trema. 
  The stria vascularis, located externally of the 
cochlear duct, produces endolymph.
  The modiolus, located internally in the spiral-
ing bony axis of the cochlea, houses the spiral 
ganglion. 
   The organ of Corti is the sensory epithe-
lium of the cochlea. It contains hair cells and 
supporting cells. Instead of a cupula found in 

the crista and macula, the sensory epithelium 
of the cochlea is in contact with the tectorial 
membrane (consisting of collagens, (cid:95)- and 
(cid:96)-tectorin, and otogelin). 
  The organ of Corti consists of two groups of 
hair cells:
  (1) Inner hair cell (IHC). Single row.
  (2) Outer hair cells (OHCs). Three rows.
  IHC and OHCs are separated from each 
other by the tunnel. The tunnel is limited by 
outer and inner pillar cells. Hair cells are sup-
ported by phalangeal cells. 
  The apical hair bundle of hair cells of the 
cochlea lack kinocilia but have stereocilia. 
   Each stereocilium of the hair bundle 
consists of a core of actin ﬁlaments. The tip 
of the actin bundle is the site where actin 
monomers are added. Stereocilia within a hair 
bundle are interconnected by extracellular 
ﬁlaments (interciliary links).  Interciliary links 
regulate the opening and closing of mechano-
electrical transduction (MET) ion channels, 
permeable to Ca2+. 

• Deafness occurs when (cid:95)-tectorin and oto-
gelin are defective in the tectorial membrane, 
connexin 26 is not present in gap junctions 
linking cochlear supporting cells, and the 
vestibulocochlear ganglion is not developed 
(Waardenburg’s syndrome). Defects in inter-
ciliary links result in Usher’s syndrome, char-
acterized by disorganization of hair bundles 
leading to sensorineural deafness of cochlear 
origin combined with retinitis pigmentosa 
(loss of vision).

PART II    ORGAN SYSTEMS | PROTECTION OF THE BODY

10. Immune-Lymphatic System

The natural physical barriers of epithelia prevent infection by blocking entry of pathogens into the body. When  
pathogens compromise the defensive nature of an epithelial barrier, cellular components of the immune system 
are recruited to combat the invading pathogen or antigens. The immune system consists of innate (natural) 
and adaptive or acquired responses interacting to confront and neutralize infectious diseases. Leukocytes, in 
particular neutrophils, provide the ﬁrst line of defense during acute inﬂammation.  Lymphocytes and macro-
phages confront pathogens during chronic inﬂammation. In this chapter, we analyze the structure and function 
of primary and secondary lymphoid organs and their involvement in general and speciﬁc defensive actions. 

Components of the lymphatic system
The lymphatic system includes primary and second-
ary lymphoid organs. 

The  primary  lymphoid  organs  produce  the  cell 

components of the immune system (Figure 10-1).

 They are:
1. The bone marrow.

2. The thymus. 
The secondary lymphoid organs are the sites where 

immune responses occur. 

They include:
1. The lymph nodes.
2. The spleen.
3. The tonsils.

Bone marrow

The cells of the immune system arise from the hematopoietic 
stem cell in the bone marrow. We discussed in Chapter 6, Blood and 
Hematopoiesis, that hematopoietic stem cells divide to produce two 
specialized stem cells: lymphoid stem cell, which generates B and T 
lymphocytes, and a myeloid stem cell, which gives rise to leukocytes, 
erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages. 

    B lymphocytes (B cells) differentiate in the bone marrow, When 
activated outside the bone marrow, B cells differentiate into 
antibody-secreting plasma cells. T lymphocytes (T cells) differentiate 
in the thymus into cells that can activate other cells of the immune 
system (helper cells) or kill bacteria- or virus-infected cells (cytolytic or 
cytotoxic cells). CFU: colony-forming unit.

ing cells in the lung (bronchial-associated lymphoid 
tissue, BALT) and the mucosa of the digestive tract

Peyer’s patches. 

The lymphatic system is widely distributed because 

pathogens can enter the body at any point.

The  main  function  of  the  lymphoid  organs,  as 
components  of  the  immune  system,  is  to  protect 
the body against invading  pathogens or antigens 
(bacteria, viruses, and parasites). The basis for this 
defense  mechanism,  or  immune  response,  is  the 
ability to distinguish self from nonself substances. 
The  two  key  cell  components  of  the  immune 
system are lymphocytes and accessory cells (Figure 
10-2). Lymphocytes include two major cell groups: 
1. B cells, responding to cell-free and cell-bound 

antigens.

2. T cells, subdivided into two categories: helper 
T  cells  and  cytolytic  or  cytotoxic  T  cells. T  cells 

 Box 10-A  | Toll-like receptors

•  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs). The term PAMPs designates proteins associated with a wide spec-
trum of pathogens recognized by cells of the innate or natural immune system.
•  Activated TLR activate in turn the NF-(cid:103)B transcription factor pathway (see 
Necroptosis in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling), which regulates cytokine expression. 
Activation of the NF-(cid:103)B pathway links innate and adaptive immune responses 
by stimulating the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as interleu-
kines and tumor necrosis factor ligand, and chemokines, as well as triggering 
the expression of  costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, and CD86).
•  The intracellular domain of the TLR has structural homology with the 
cytoplasmic region of interleukin-1 receptors. It is known as Toll-interleukin-1 
receptor domain, or TIR domain, and participates in signaling by recruiting 
downstream proteins.  
•  The extracellular region of the TLR contains leucine-rich repeat (LLR) motifs, 
whereas the extracellular domain of interleukin receptors contains three 
immunoglobulin-like domains.  LLR is involved in the recognition of PAMPs 
facilitated by accessory proteins (for example, lipopolysaccharides).

10. IMMUNE-LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

Immune system

respond to cell-bound antigens presented by speciﬁc 
molecules.

After leaving the two primary organs (bone marrow 
and thymus), mature B and T cells circulate in the 
blood until they reach one of the various secondary 
lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils). 
B and T cells can leave the bloodstream through 
specialized venules called high endothelial venules, so 
called because they are lined by tall endothelial cells 
instead of the typical squamous endothelial cell type.  
The accessory cells include two monocyte-derived 
cell types: macrophages and dendritic cells.  An ex-
ample of a dendritic cell is the Langerhans cell found 
in the epidermis of the skin. A third type, the follicular 
dendritic cell, is present in lymphatic nodules of the 
lymph  nodes.  Follicular  dendritic  cells  differ  from 
ordinary  dendritic  cells  in  that  they  do  not  derive 
from a bone marrow precursor.  

Before we start our discussion of the origin, differ-
entiation, and interaction of  lymphocytes and acces-
sory cells, we need to deﬁne the characteristics of the 
immune system. Then, we will be able to integrate the 
structural aspects of each major lymphatic organ with 
the speciﬁc characteristics of the immune responses.

Types of immunity
Immunity in general is the reaction of cells and tissues 
to foreign (nonself) substances or pathogens includ-
ing bacterial, viral, and parasite antigens. Two types 
of immunity are distinguished: 

1. Innate or natural immunity.
2. Adaptive or acquired immunity (Figure 10-3). 
Innate  or  natural  immunity  of  the  newborn  is 
the  simplest  mechanism  of  protection.  It  does  not 
require previous exposure to a pathogen and elicits 
rapid responses by macrophages and dendritic cells. 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see Box 10-A) initiate 
innate  immunity  against  components  of  invading 
pathogens (such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and 
polysaccharides). Different TLRs recognize distinct 
types of conserved microbial structures, a condition 
that provides speciﬁcity to the innate response. 

We discuss later in this chapter that the comple-
ment  system,  consisting  of  serum  proteins,  mem-
brane-bound regulators and receptors, is also a key 
mechanism of innate defense triggered rapidly upon 
infection. Stimulation of macrophages and dendritic 
cells by activated TLRs and the complement system  
leads to the production and secretion of proinﬂam-
matory cytokines, thereby initiating an inﬂammatory 
response.  

Adaptive or acquired immunity develops when an 
individual is exposed to a pathogen with the aims of 
eliminating the pathogen as well as the generation of 
immunologic memory. 

To  achieve  adaptive  or  acquired  immunity,  it  is

necessary  to  select  lymphocytes  (clonal  selection) 
from a vast repertoire of cells bearing antigen-speciﬁc 
receptors generated by a mechanism known as gene 
rearrangement.  You can regard adaptive immunity as 
the perfection of innate or natural immunity because 
it recognizes vital components of the microorganism  
utilizing  a  limited  number  of  pattern-recognition 
receptors expressed on all cells of a given type (non-
clonal) and independent of immunologic memory.
Adaptive or acquired immunity involves two types 

of responses to an antigen (or pathogen): 

1. The  ﬁrst  response  is  mediated  by  antibodies 
produced  by  plasma  cells,  the  final  differentia-
tion product of B cells as we have seen in Chapter 
4,  Connective Tissue. This  response  is  known  as 
humoral  immunity  and  operates  against  antigens 
located outside a cell or bound to its surface. When 
antibodies bind to an antigen or toxins produced by 
a pathogen, they can facilitate the phagocytic action 
of macrophages or recruit leukocytes and mast cells 
to take advantage of their cytokines and mediators, 
respectively,  and  strengthen  a  response.  Humoral 
immunity results in persistent antibody production 
and production of memory cells.

2. The second response requires the uptake of a 
pathogen by a phagocyte. An intracellular pathogen 
is  not  accessible  to  antibodies  and  requires  a  cell-
mediated response, or cell-mediated  immunity. T 
cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells are the key 
players in cell-mediated immunity.

A consequence of adaptive or acquired immunity 
is  the  protection  of  the  individual  when  a  second 
encounter with the pathogen occurs. This protection 
is speciﬁc against the same pathogen and, therefore, 
adaptive or acquired immunity is also called speciﬁc 
immunity.

Passive immunity is a temporary form of immu-

nity conferred by serum or lymphocytes transferred 
from an immunized individual to another individual 
who has not been exposed or cannot respond to a 
pathogen. The transfer of maternal antibodies to the 
fetus is a form of passive immunity that protects new-
borns from infections until they can develop active 
immunity. Active immunity is the form of immunity 
resulting from exposure to a pathogen. 

Properties of adaptive or acquired immunity
Both  humoral  and  cell-mediated  immunity  devel-
oped  against  foreign  pathogens  have  the  following 
characteristics: 

1. Speciﬁcity: Speciﬁc domains of an antigen are 
recognized by individual lymphocytes. We will see 
later how cell membrane receptors on lymphocytes 
can  distinguish  and  respond  to  subtle  variations 
in the structure of antigens offered by an antigen-
presenting cell. This molecular interaction between 
cells is known as immunologic synapse.

2. Diversity: Lymphocytes utilize a gene rearrange-
ment mechanism to modify their antigen receptors 
in such a way that they can recognize and respond 
to a large number and types of antigenic domains.

3. Memory: The exposure of lymphocytes to an 
antigen results in two events: their antigen-speciﬁc 
clonal expansion by mitosis, as well as the genera-
tion of reserve memory cells. Memory cells can react 
more rapidly and efﬁciently when exposed again to 
the same antigen.

4. Self-limitation: An immune response is stimu-
lated by a speciﬁc antigen. When the antigen is neu-
tralized or disappears, the response ceases. 

5.  Tolerance:  An  immune  response  pursues  the 
removal of a non-self antigen while being “tolerant” 
to self-antigens. Tolerance is achieved by a selection 
mechanism that eliminates lymphocytes expressing 
receptors speciﬁc for self-antigens. A failure of self-
tolerance (and speciﬁcity) leads to a group of disorders 
called autoimmune diseases.

Development  and  maturation  of  B  cells  in  bone 
marrow
The bone marrow is the site of origin of B and T cells 
from a lymphoid stem cell. In Chapter 6, Blood and 
Hematopoiesis, we discuss developmental aspects of 
the myeloid and erythroid lineages from a hematopoi-
etic stem cell. The same hematopoietic stem cell gives 
rise to a lymphoid stem cell that generates precursors 
for B cells and T cells (see Figure 10-1). B cells mature 
in the bone marrow, whereas the thymus is the site 
of maturation of T cells. 

Stem B cells in the bone marrow proliferate and 
mature in a microenvironmental niche provided by 
bone marrow stromal cells producing interleukin-7 
(IL-7) (Figure 10-4). 

During maturation, B cells express on their surface

with two additional proteins linked to each other, 
immunoglobulins  (cid:95)(cid:3) (Ig(cid:95)(cid:9)  and  (cid:96)(cid:3) (Ig(cid:96)(cid:9). The  cell 
surface IgM or IgD, together with the conjoined Ig(cid:95)(cid:3)
and Ig(cid:96)(cid:11) form the B cell antigen receptor complex. 
The intracellular domains of Ig(cid:95)(cid:3)and Ig(cid:96)(cid:3)contain 
a  tyrosine-rich  domain  called  immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM).

 Binding of an antigen to the B lymphocyte anti-
gen receptor complex induces the phosphorylation 
of tyrosine in the ITAM, which, in turn, activates 
transcription factors that drive the expression of genes 
required for further development of B cells.

Self-antigens  present  in  the  bone  marrow  test 
the antigen-binding speciﬁcity of IgM or IgD on B 
cell surfaces. This is a required testing step before B 
cells can continue their maturation, enter peripheral 
lymphoid  tissues,  and  interact  with  foreign  (non-
self) antigens. Self-antigens binding strongly to two 
or more IgM or IgD receptor molecules on B cells 
induce apoptosis. Self-antigens with a weaker bind-
ing afﬁnity for the B cell antigen receptor complex 
enable the survival and maturation of these B cells 
when  ITAMs of IgM- or IgD-associated Ig(cid:95)(cid:3)and 
Ig(cid:96)(cid:3)transduce signaling events, resulting in further 
differentiation of B cells and the entrance of mature 
B cells into the circulation.  

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and 
human leukocyte antigens (HLA)   
The presentation of antigens to T cells is carried out 
by specialized proteins encoded by genes in the major 
histocompatibility locus and present on the surface of 
antigen-presenting cells, the macrophages. 

Antigen-presenting cells survey the body, ﬁnd and 
internalize  antigens  by  phagocytosis,  break  them 
down  into  antigenic  peptide  fragments,  and  bind 
them to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
molecules (Figure 10-5) so that the antigen peptide 
fragment–MHC complex can be exposed later on 
the surface of the cells. 

The MHC gene locus expresses gene products re-
sponsible for the rejection of grafted tissue between 
two genetically incompatible hosts.

There are two types of mouse MHC gene products: 

class I MHC and class II MHC. 

1.  Class  I  MHC  consists  of  two  polypeptide 
chains: an (cid:95)(cid:3)chain, consisting of three domains ((cid:95)1, 
(cid:95)2, and (cid:95)3) encoded by the MHC gene locus, and
(cid:96)2-microglobulin, not encoded by the MHC gene locus. 
Antigens are housed in a cleft formed by the  (cid:95)1
and  (cid:95)2 domains. CD8, a coreceptor on the surface 
of cytolytic T cells, binds to the  (cid:95)3 domain of class 
I MHC. 

2.  Class  II  MHC  consists  of  two  polypeptide 
chains, an (cid:95) chain and a (cid:96) chain. Both chains are 
encoded by the MHC gene locus. The  (cid:95)1 and  (cid:96)1 
domains  form  an  antigen-binding  cleft.  CD4,  a 
coreceptor on the surface of helper T cells, binds to 
the  (cid:96)2 domain of class II MHC.  

CD4 and CD8 are cell surface identiﬁers, members 
of the cluster of differentiation or designation (ab-
breviated as CD). See Box 10-B.

All nucleated cells express class I MHC molecules. 
Class  II  MHC  molecules  are  restricted  mainly  to 
antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, 
and B cells), thymic epithelial cells of the thymus, 
and endothelial cells.

 Box 10-B  | CD antigens

•  Cell surface molecules recognized by monoclonal antibodies are called 
antigens. These antigens are markers that enable the identiﬁcation and 
characterization of cell populations. A surface marker that identiﬁes a member 
of a group of cells, has a deﬁned structure, and is also recognized in other 
members of the group by a monoclonal antibody is called a cluster of differen-
tiation or designation (CD).  
•  A helper T cell, which expresses the CD4 marker, can be differentiated from 
a cytolytic T cell, which does not contain CD4 but expresses the CD8 marker. 
•  CD markers permit the classiﬁcation of T cells that participate in inﬂamma-
tory and immune reactions. CD antigens promote cell-cell interaction and 
adhesion as well as signaling leading to  T cell activation.

The MHC-equivalent molecules in the human are 
designated human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). HLA 
molecules are structurally and functionally homolo-
gous to mouse MHC molecules and the gene locus is  
present on human chromosome 5 ((cid:96)2-microglobulin 
is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15). 

The class I MHC locus encodes three major pro-
teins in the human: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C.  
The class II MHC locus encodes HLA-DR (R for 
antigenically related), HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP (Q 
and P preceding R in the alphabet).

T cell receptor  
In addition to MHC molecules, subsets of  T cells 
have cell surface receptors  that enable each of them 
to  recognize  a  different  antigen–MHC  combina-
tion. Antigen recognition involves an immunologic 
synapse mechanism consisting in the formation of 
stable  antigen-presenting  cell–T  cell  adhesiveness 
followed by an activating signaling cascade by T cells 
(see Box 10-C).

The receptor that recognizes speciﬁc antigenic pep-
tides presented by class I and class II MHC molecules 
is the T cell receptor (TCR). TCR acts together with 
accessory cell surface molecules, the coreceptors, to 
stabilize the binding of antigen-presenting cells to 
T  cells.  Developing  T  cells  express  unique  TCRs 
generated by random rearrangement of a variety of 
gene  segments.  These  randomly  produced  TCRs 

 Box 10-C  | The immunologic synapse

•  The initiation and regulation of a speciﬁc immune response depends on the 
communication between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The 
immunologic response results from molecular interactions at the site of T-cell 
and APC contact also known as the immunologic synapse. The immunologic 
synapse is a combined cell-cell adhesion and cell signaling device.
•  The diversity of cell surface molecules of APCs (class I MHC and class II 
MHC) and T cells (T cell receptor and coreceptors) provides a framework for 
the molecular regulation and activity of the immunologic synapse. The im-
munologic synapse has a signiﬁcant role in T cell maturation, activation and dif-
ferentiation taking place in the cortex of the thymus. The immunologic synapse 
concept also applies to B cell maturation in bone marrow.

provide the diversity required to identify numerous 
foreign peptides.

The TCR consists of two disulﬁde-linked trans-
membrane polypeptide chains: the (cid:95)(cid:3)chain and the 
(cid:96) chain (see Figure 10-5). A limited number of  T 
cells have a TCR composed of (cid:97)(cid:3)and (cid:98) chains. Each  
(cid:95)(cid:3)and (cid:96) chain consists of a variable (V(cid:95)(cid:3)and V(cid:96)) 
domain and a constant (C(cid:95) and C(cid:96)) domain. When 
compared with the immunoglobulin molecule, the 
V(cid:95)(cid:3)and V(cid:96)(cid:3)domains are structurally and function-
ally similar to the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of 
immunoglobulins. 

The TCR molecule is associated with two proteins, 
CD3 and (cid:99)(cid:3)(not shown in Figure 10-5), forming the 
TCR complex. CD3 and (cid:99)(cid:3)have a signaling role and 
are present in all T cells. CD3 contains the ITAM 
cytoplasmic domain previously mentioned as part of 
the B cell antigen receptor complex and involved in 
signaling functions.

CD4 and CD8 coreceptors
CD4 and CD8 are T cell surface proteins interact-
ing selectively with class II MHC and class I MHC 
molecules, respectively. When the TCR recognizes an 
antigen bound to the cleft of  MHC, CD4 or CD8 
coreceptors cooperate in the activation of T cell func-
tion (see Figure 10-5). 

CD4 and CD8 are members of the immunoglobu-
lin (Ig) superfamily. In Chapter 1, Epithelium, we 
discuss the function and structure of cell adhesion 
molecules belonging to the Ig superfamily.

Members  of  the  Ig  superfamily  have  a  variable 
number of extracellular Ig-like domains. The two 
terminal  Ig-like  domains  of  CD4  bind  to  the  (cid:96)2 
domain of the class II MHC (see Figure 10-5). The 
single Ig-like domain of CD8 binds to the (cid:95)3 domain 
of the class I MHC. 

Thus,  CD4+  helper  T  cells  recognize  antigens 
associated with class II MHC, and CD8+ cytolytic T 
cells (cytolytic thymus-derived lymphocytes [CTL]) 
respond  to  antigens  presented  by  class  I  MHC 
(Figure 10-6).

T cell maturation in the thymus: Positive and nega-
tive selection
Two initial events take place in the thymus during 
T cell maturation: 

1. A sequence rearrangement of the gene encoding 

protein components of  the TCR.

2.  The  transient  coexistence  of  TCR-associated 

coreceptors CD4 and CD8.

When precursor cells, derived from the bone mar-
row, enter the cortex of the thymus, they lack surface 
molecules  typical  of  mature T  cells.  Because  they 
still do not express CD4 and CD8, they are called 
“double-negative” T cells (Figure 10-7).

CD4+ helper T cells recognize an antigen presented by class II 
MHC molecules.
    Each class II MHC molecule consists of a single extracellular 
peptide-binding cleft formed by a pair of MHC-encoded 
immunoglobulin-like chains. The (cid:95)1 and (cid:96)1 regions of each chain, 
anchored to the membrane of the antigen-presenting cell, interact to 
form the peptide-binding cleft.
    Coreceptor CD4 binds to the (cid:96)2 region of class II MHC.

T cells recognize peptide antigens only when they are presented  
bound to MHC. CD8+ cytolytic T cells recognize an antigen 
presented by class I MHC molecules.  Helper T cells 
recognize an antigen in association with class II MHC 
molecules. This property is called MHC restriction. 
    Class I MHC is a heterodimer consisting of a plasma 
membrane, anchored (cid:95) chain, an attached (cid:96)2-microglobulin and 
a bound antigen peptide.
    Coreceptor CD8 binds to the (cid:95)3 region of class I MHC. 

After interacting with thymic epithelial cells, the 
stroma components of the thymus, double-negative 
T cells proliferate, differentiate, and express the ﬁrst 
T cell–speciﬁc molecules: TCR and coreceptors CD4 
and CD8.

As we have already seen, TCR consists of two pairs

of subunits: (cid:95)(cid:96) chains or (cid:97)(cid:98)(cid:3)chains (see Figure 10-5). 
Each chain can vary in sequence from one T cell to 
another. This variation is determined by the random 
combination of gene segments and has a bearing on 
which foreign antigen T cells can recognize.  

Maturation  of   T  cells  proceeds  through  a  stage 
where both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors and low levels 
of TCR are expressed by the same cell. These cells 
are known as “double-positive” T cells. 

Double-positive T cells can  or cannot  recognize 
self-MHC  expressed  by  thymic  epithelial  cells  in 
the cortex of the thymus. Selected T cells must be
self-MHC–restricted and self-tolerant. Those cells 
that can recognize self-MHC eventually mature and 
express one of the two coreceptor molecules (CD4 or 
CD8) and become “single-positive” T cells (clonal 
selection).    Double-positive  cells  that  cannot  rec-
ognize self-MHC fail the positive selection and are 
discarded (clonal deletion).

There  is  an  additional  test  for  the  selected  self-
MCH–restricted T cells: only those T cells that can 
recognize foreign peptides and self-MHC survive. 
If   T  cells  bind  to  body’s  tissue-speciﬁc  antigens

Precursor cells entering the 
thymus from the bone marrow lack 
surface molecules typical of 
mature T cells: thymus cell 
receptor (TCR), and CD4 and 
CD8 coreceptors. These cells are 
called “double-negative”  T cells. 
These cells are seen in the 
subcapsular cortex region of the 
thymus.

T cells begin to rearrange the 
gene encoding TCR and express 
CD4 and CD8 coreceptors by the 
same cell. These cells are known 
as “double-positive”  T cells. 
These cells are seen deeper in the 
cortex of the thymus.

T cells whose receptors bind 
self-MHC molecules lose 
expression of either CD4 or CD8 
and increase the level of 
expression of TCR. These are 
mature “single-positive”  T cells. 
These cells are seen in the 
medulla of the thymus.

(self-molecules),  they  are  eliminated  by  apoptosis 
and cleared by macrophages.

So, where are the testing foreign and self-peptides 

coming from? 

Branching and interconnected thymic cortical epi-
thelial cells in the cortex of the thymus synthesize and 
present self and non-self peptides to the previously 
selected T cells shown to be self-MHC-restricted and 
self-tolerant. Only those T cells that can recognize 
foreign (non-self) peptides and self-MHC survive.  
After completing the positive selection tests in the 
cortex of the thymus, T cells need to fullﬁl an ad-
ditional requirement in the medulla of the thymus.
The medulla of the thymus houses thymic medul-
lary epithelial cells that produce cytokines involved 
in optimizing the negative selection of potentially 
autoreactive T cells. 

When T cells complete their development in the 
thymus, they enter the bloodstream and migrate to 
the peripheral lymphoid organs in search of an anti-
gen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. We 
come back to additional details of the T cell matura-
tion saga in our discussion of the thymus.
 
How do CD4+ helper T cells help?
CD4+  helper T  cells  are  activated  when  they  rec-

ognize the antigen peptide–class II MHC complex 
(Figure 10-8). 

In the presence of cells with antigen peptide bound 
to class II MHC, CD4+ helper T cells proliferate by 
mitosis and secrete cytokines, also called interleukins. 
These chemical signals, in turn, attract B cells, which 
also have receptor molecules of  single speciﬁcity on 
their  surface  (immunoglobulin  receptor).  Unlike 
helper  T  cells,  B  cells  can  recognize  free  antigen 
peptides without MHC molecules.

When activated by interleukins produced by the 
proliferating helper T cells, B cells also divide and 
differentiate  into  plasma  cells  secreting  immuno-
globulins. Secreted immunoglobulins diffuse freely, 
bind to antigen peptides to neutralize them, or trigger 
their destruction by enzymes or macrophages.

Plasma  cells  synthesize  only  one  class  of  im-
munoglobulin  (several  thousand  immunoglobulin 
molecules  per  second;  lifetime  of  a  plasma  cell  is 
from 10 to 20 days). Five classes of immunoglobulins 
are recognized in humans: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and 
IgD (see Box 10-D). Abnormal plasma cells may ac-
cumulate in bones and bone marrow, causing bone 
destruction and affecting the production of  normal 
blood cells. This pathologic condition is called mul-
tiple myeloma (see Box 10-E).  

Some T and B cells become memory  cells, ready 
to eliminate the same antigen if it recurs in the future. 
The secondary immune response (re-encounter with 
the same antigen that triggered their production) is  
more rapid and of greater magnitude. Memory cells 
recirculate for many years and provide a surveillance 
system directed against foreign antigens.

T cell subsets: TH1 and TH2 cells and cytolytic or 
cytotoxic T cells
We have seen that B cells can differentiate into immu-
noglobulin-secreting plasma cells under the inﬂuence 
of  cytokines produced by CD4+ helper T cells. 

B cells can present antigens, thus allowing direct 
interaction with T cells, which produce and secrete 
cytokines for plasma cell development. Plasma cells 
are effector cells; they use antibodies to  neutralize 
extracellular pathogens. In contrast, T cells are pri-
mary effector cells for controlling or killing intracel-
lular pathogens.

There are T cell  subsets: TH1 and TH2 cells, de-
rived from CD4+ T cells in the presence of speciﬁc 
cytokines, and CD8+ cytolytic T cells. 

1. TH1  cells  participate  in  delayed-type  hyper-
sensitivity reactions (discussed later in this chapter)
and the regulation of immune responses caused by 
intracellular pathogens (viruses, certain bacteria, or 
single-cell  parasites)  with  the  signiﬁcant  participa-
tion of macrophages. Interferon-(cid:97)(cid:11) produced by TH1 
cells,  stimulates the differentiation of TH1 cells but 
suppresses the proliferation of TH2 cells.

        A macrophage, acting as an

antigen-presenting cell, processes a 
phagocytosed antigen that is then bound 
to class II MHC and presented to a 
helper T cell (cell-mediated immunity). 

         An activated helper T cell divides 
2
by mitosis to increase the population of 
helper T cells at the site of antigen 
presentation.

3
         Helper T cells interact with B cells 
in the presence of an antigen-presenting 
cell to induce (1) immediate access of B 
cells to free antigen in the extracellular 
space and (2) proliferation of B cells.

4
         B cells with cell surface-specific 
immunoglobulin arrive at the site to 
rapidly neutralize free antigen.

5
         B cells differentiate into plasma 
cells that secrete immunoglobulin to 
block free antigen (humoral immunity).

2. TH2  cells  are  involved  in  immune  responses 
observed in patients with helminthic (Greek helmins, 
worm) intestinal parasites. TH2 cells produce inter-
leukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), among

immunoglobulin  E  by  plasma  cells  to  activate  the 
responses of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils.

TH2-derived IL-4 and IL-10 suppress the activation 
of TH1 cells. As you can see, each subset produces cy-
tokines that inhibit development of the other subset. 
The activation of macrophage responses is minimal 

in TH2-driven immune responses. 

3. Cytolytic or cytotoxic T cells display TCR and 
CD8  coreceptor.  CD8+ cytolytic T  cells  recognize 
class I MHC on antigen-presenting cells. 

They  are  involved  in  antigen-speciﬁc,  MHC-re-
stricted cytotoxicity and in the killing of intracellular 
pathogens that are not accessible to secreted antibod-
ies. Cell killing is caused by the release of perforin or 
Fas ligand as already discussed

and cytolytic T cells when we discuss their involve-
ment in the pathology of human immunodeﬁciency 
virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection, allergy, and cancer 
immunotherapy.

How do CD8+ cytolytic T cells kill?
Another  function  of  CD4+ helper T  cells  is  to  se-
crete  cytokines  to  stimulate  the  proliferation  of 
CD8+ cytolytic  T  cells  that  recognize  the  antigen 
peptide–class  I  MHC  complex  on  the  surface  of 
antigen-presenting cells.

How CD8+ cytolytic T cells kill

1
       A  CD8+ cytolytic T cell binds to an 
antigen-presenting cell and is activated by 
interleukin-1 produced by the 
antigen-presenting cell (paracrine 
mechanism), and by interleukin-2, 
produced by the cytolytic T cell (autocrine 
mechanism). The cytolytic T cell divides by 
mitosis to increase the cell population.

2
        In the presence of an 
antigen-presenting cell containing a 
pathogen antigen (a virus), cytolytic T cells 
release protein pore-forming perforin to 
kill the infected target cell. The CD8+ 
cytolytic T cell protects itself with protectin, 
a cell surface molecule that binds perforin. 
However, the infected antigen-presenting 
cell lacks protectin and is vulnerable to the 
action of perforin. Perforin facilitates the 
delivery of pro-apoptotic granzyme B 
proteases to the target cell.
3
        Fas ligand, released by the cytolytic 
T cell and bound to the Fas receptor, 
together with granzyme destroy by 
apoptosis the target cell.  

1. Attaching ﬁrmly to the antigen-presenting cell 
with the help of integrins and cell adhesion molecules 
(CAMs) on the cell surface of the target cell.

2. Inducing cell membrane damage by the release 

of pore-forming proteins (called perforins). 

These pores facilitate the unregulated entry of the 
pro-apoptotic protease granzyme, water, and salts. 
The cytolytic T cell protects itself by a membrane 
protein, protectin, that inactivates perforin, block-
ing its insertion into the cytolytic T cell membrane.
CD8+  cytolytic T  cells  can  also  destroy  target 

 Box 10-E  | Multiple myeloma

 

• Multiple myeloma is caused by the abnormal growth of plasma cells in bone 
marrow and bone.  An excessive grow of malignant plasma cells in bone and 
marrow causes bone fractures and prevents the production of normal blood 
cells in the marrow. Anemia, abnormal bleeding and high risk of infections may 
develop.  Compression of the spinal cord by myeloma cells growing in vertebra 
can cause back pain, numbness, or paralysis.
• Myeloma cells produce an excessive amount of an abnormal immunoglobulin, 
called Bence Jones protein, present in serum and urine. Renal failure may 
occur because of the accumulation of immunoglobulins in the kidneys.
• Bone marrow transplantation (autologous, from the same patient, or al-
logenic, from a healthy and compatible donor) is a form of treatment in patients 
resistant or nonresponsive to chemotherapy.  First, the bone marrow of the 
recipient is depleted with very high doses of chemotherapy and low doses of 
radiation therapy, and then followed by the administration of donor’s marrow 
cells into the blood of the patient. Hematopoietic stem cells will then localize in 
bone marrow and repopulate it.  

cells by the Fas-Fas ligand mechanism seen during 
apoptosis (see Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).  When the 
cytolytic T cell receptor recognizes an antigen on the 
surface of a target cell, Fas ligand is produced in the 
cytolytic T cell. The interaction of Fas ligand with 
the trimerized Fas receptor on the target cell surface 
(see Figure 10-9) triggers the apoptotic cascade by 
activation of procaspases into caspases that determine 
cell death.

Natural killer cells
Natural killer cells destroy virus-infected cells and 
tumor  cells,  but  this  activity  does  not  depend  on 
antigen activation.  Natural killer cells do not belong 
to the T or B cell types (they do not express TCR). 
Human natural killer cells have CD56 receptors as 
well as inhibitory and activating receptors interacting 
respectively with class I MHC and activating ligand 
of normal cells. Target cells lacking class I MHC ac-
tivate the destructive function of natural killer cells. 
The mechanism by which natural killer cells destroy 
target cells is described in Figure 10-10.

       NK cells are activated when the

an excess of activating ligand in the target

  HIV  infects  macrophages,  dendritic  cells,  and 
predominantly CD4-bearing helper T cells. HIV is a 
member of the lentivirus family of animal retroviruses 
and causes long-term latent cellular infection. 

HIV  includes  two  types,  designated  HIV-1  and 
HIV-2. HIV-1 is the cause of AIDS. The genome of 
the infectious HIV consists of two strands of RNA 
enclosed  within  a  core  of  viral  proteins  and  sur-
rounded by a lipid envelope derived from the infected 
cell. HIV particles are present in blood, semen, and 
other body ﬂuids. Transmission is by sexual contact 
or needle injection. 

The  viral  lipid  envelope    contains  glycoproteins 
designated  gp41  and  gp120,  encoded  by  the  env 
viral sequence.

introduces its genetic material (RNA) and proteins into the cytoplasm. 
• The genome of a typical retrovirus includes three coding regions: gag, pol, 
and env, specifying, respectively, proteins of the viral core, the enzyme reverse 
transcriptase, and constituents of the viral coat.  
• In the cytoplasm, reverse transcriptase converts viral RNA into DNA which is 
then inserted into cellular DNA. This process is called integration.
• The provirus DNA directs the synthesis of viral proteins and RNA.  
• Viral proteins and RNA assemble and new viral particles bud off from the cell.

gp120  changes  its  conformation  and  binds  to  the 
chemokine host-cell receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4).   
The glycoprotein gp41 mediates HIV-cell fusion to 
permit viral entry. 

 Figure 10-11 presents a summary of the cellular 
events  associated  with  HIV  infection.  Box  10-F 
summarizes the steps of the HIV reproductive cycle.
Antiretroviral  therapy  (ART)  based  on  the  re-
productive  cycle  of  the  virus,  reduces  and  almost 
completely blocks HIV-1 transmission to uninfected 
individuals.  For example, the fusion inhibitor, enfu-
virtive, blocks fusion between gp41 and CD4. The 
CCR5  coreceptor  antagonist,  maraviroc,  prevents 
gp120-mediated viral binding to CCR5. 

A relevant event of HIV infection is the destruction 
of CD4+ helper T cells responsible for the initiation 
of  immune  responses,  leading  to  the  elimination 
of  HIV  infection.    CD8+  cytolytic  T  cells  (that 
attach to virus-infected cells) and B cells (that give 
rise  to  antibody-producing  plasma  cells)  represent 
an acquired or adaptive response to HIV infection. 
Antibodies to HIV antigens are detected within 6 to 
9 weeks after infection.

General Pathology: Hypersensitivity reactions
Hypersensitivity is a distinct immune response result-
ing in harmful host reactions rather protection against 
a pathogen. There are four types of hypersensitivity 
reactions:

1.  Type  1  hypersensitivity,  involving  IgE  and

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect and 
destroy immune cells. 
    CD4, the coreceptor of helper T cells, is a receptor for the HIV-1 
envelope protein glycoprotein 120 (gp120) that, after a conformation 
change, binds to chemokine host-cell coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. CD4 
is also expressed on the surface of macrophages, they can also be 
infected by this virus.
     The virus can replicate within host cells for many years before 
symptoms are detected (clinical latency) (see Box 10-F for an 
explanation of steps of the HIV reproductive cycle). The early indication 
of HIV-1 infection is the presence of antibodies to gp120, a viral 
envelope protein, and against p24, a core protein.
    During the early phase of HIV-1 infection, infected helper T cells are 
destroyed and replenished. When the rate of destruction exceeds the 
replenishing capacity of CD4 cells, cell-mediated immunity is 
compromised and the patient is susceptible to fatal opportunistic 
infections. The CD4  helper T cell count is the best indicator of the 
time-course progression of AIDS.
    CD4  helper T cells are destroyed either by a cytotoxic effect 
determined by HIV-1 infection or by the direct action of cytolytic T cells.
    Blood banks screen blood donation for antibodies to gp120. However, 
the level of antibody may be low, particularly during the early phase of 
infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), based on the biological features 
of the virus, almost reduces or completely blocks HIV-1 transmission.

Allergens trigger allergy, an immune response in which 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies play a significant role.
        This response develops when an allergen breaks a protective 
1
barrier (such as an epithelial layer).
        The antigen is presented by an antigen-presenting cell to a helper 
2
T cell.
        Depending on the nature of the allergen, one helper T cell 
3
subtype (either TH1 or TH2) is recruited to drive the production of IgE. 
Intestinal helminthic parasites involve the actions of TH2 cells.

        TH2 cells produce interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and other cytokines

to induce the proliferation of B cells and development of other effector 
cells (mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils).

A subsequent exposure to the same allergen following sensitization 
finds antigen-presenting cells, TH2 cells, and monocytes with Fc(cid:161)RI 
receptors on their surfaces. IgE can bind without delay to Fc(cid:161)RI 
receptors that aggregate and trigger cell signaling responses. 
Receptor aggregation induces three types of reactions:
       Acute reaction (anaphylaxis, acute asthmatic response) within 
1
seconds to minutes, triggered by mediators released by mast cells 
and basophils.

        Late reactions (2 to 6 hours following exposure to allergen) 
2
attract circulating eosinophils, basophils, and TH2 cells to the site.
       Chronic reactions can develop over days and weeks and 
3
determine alterations in the structure and function of the affected 
tissue (for example, respiratory pathology in asthma) caused by a 
number of cytokines, mediators, and inflammatory agents.  
Corticosteroids are required to suppress inflammation determined by 
chronic reactions.

allergens leading to the degranulation of mast cells 
or  basophils  (see  Chapter  4,  Connective Tissue). 
Allergy refers to immune responses characterized by 
the participation of IgE bound to a special receptor, 
designated Fc (cid:161)RI. When an antigen or allergen binds 
to two adjacent IgE molecules, it induces aggregation 
of the IgE molecules and  associated Fc (cid:161)RI receptors. 
This event results in a signaling cascade that leads to 
the release of mediators and cytokines (Figure 10-12). 

Note that there are  two phases: 
1. Sensitization phase, following an initial expo-

sure to an allergen.

2. Effector phase, after a suibsequent exposure to 
an allergen. Also note that two subsets of helper T 
cell, TH1 and TH2, can trigger distinct responses when 
activated by speciﬁc antigens.

2. Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions are caused by 
antibodies directed against plasma membrane-bound 
antigens resulting in cytolysis. Type 2 hypersensitiv-
ity  may involve the complement system (see below). 
Examples are autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Rh 
incompatibility leading to erythroblastosis fetalis (see 
Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis).

3. Type 3 hypersensitivity is determined by the 
formation of soluble antigen-antibody complexes that 
activate the complement system. An example is the 
Arthus reaction in response to intradermal injection 
of antigen (signiﬁcant neutrophil inﬁltrate, erythema 
[redness of the skin] and edema). Type 3 hypersensi-
tivity, and the resulting inﬂammatory injury caused 
by antigen-antibody complex deposition on synovial 
membranes,  are  seen  in  rheumatoid  arthritis  (see 
Chapter  5,  Osteogenesis),  infectious  arthritis  and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. 

4.  Type  4  hypersensitivity,  also  called  delayed 
hypersensitivity,  involves  antigen–T  cell–macro-
phage interactions determining the formation of a 
granuloma. Tuberculosis, leprosy, sarcoidosis and 
contact dermatitis are clinical examples. 

The Mantoux reaction in the tuberculin skin test is 
a classic delayed hypersensitivity reaction.  The injec-
tion of puriﬁed protein derivative from Mycobacteria 
tuberculosis into the skin of an individual sensitized to 
tuberculosis (by exposure or infection) result in the 
activation of sensitized CD4+ helper cells that secrete 
cytokines recruiting and activating macrophages. This 
local reaction is manifested by erythema and edema 
in the injected skin site within 48 hours.

A chronic granuloma represents an ampliﬁed tissue 
reaction that develops in response to a sustained im-
mune response to released antigens rather than to the 
triggering pathogen itself. Helper T cells or cytotoxic 
T cells, macrophages and multinucleated giant cells 
are the hallmark of chronic granulomas. 

We  come  back  to Type  4  hypersensitivity  and 
chronic granuloma when we address the process of 
chronic inﬂammation.

General Pathology: Complement system
The main function of the complement system is to 
enable the direct destruction of pathogens or target 
cells by phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) by 
a mechanism known as opsonization (Greek opsonein, 
to buy provisions) by producing proteolytic enzyme 
complexes (Figure 10-13). 

Complement provides a rapid and efﬁcient mecha-
nism  for  eliminating  pathogens  to  prevent  tissue 
injury  or  chronic  infection.  Host  tissues  have  cell 
surface–anchored  regulatory  proteins,  which  can 
inhibit  complement  activation  and  prevent  unin-
tended damage. 

The  complement  system  consists  of  about  20 
plasma  proteins,  synthesized  mainly  in  the  liver, 
that complement, or enhance, a tissue response to 
pathogens.  Several  components  of  this  system  are 
proenzymes converted to active enzymes. 

  Activation  of  the  complement  cascade  can  be 

triggered by:

1. Antibodies bound to a pathogen (classic path-

way).

2.  Binding of mannose-binding lectin to a bacterial 

carbohydrate moiety (lectin pathway).

3. By spontaneous activation of C3, a proenzyme 
(inactive  precursor)  of  the  complement  sequence 
(alternative pathway).  

The critical molecule of the complement cascade 
is C1, a hexamer, called C1q, with binding afﬁnity 
to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. C1q is also  
associated with two molecules, C1r and C1s.

When the globular domains of C1q bind to the Fc 
regions of  immunoglobulins already bound to the 
surface of a pathogen, C1r is activated and converts 
C1s into a serine protease. Activation of C1s marks 
the ﬁrst step of the complement activation cascade.
The  second  step  is  the  cleavage  of  complement 

protein C4 by C1s. Two fragments are produced: 

1.The small fragment C4a is discarded.
2. The large fragment C4b binds to the pathogen 

surface.

The third step occurs when complement protein 
C2 is cleaved by C1s into C2a (discarded) and C2b. 
C2b binds to the already bound C4b, forming the 
complex C4b-2b, also called  C3 convertase, on the 
surface of a pathogen.

The  fourth  step  takes  place  when  complement 
protein C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase into C3a (dis-
carded) and C3b. C3b binds to C3 convertase. The 
C4b-2b-3b complex, now designated C5 convertase, 
cleaves complement protein C5 into C5a (discarded) 
and C5b. C5b binds to C5 convertase.

The last  steps  consist  in  the  binding  of  the  op-
sonized pathogen to complement receptors on the 
surface of  the phagocyte. Additional complement 
proteins are C6, C7, C8, and C9. C9 binds to the 
protein  complex  and  forms  the  membrane  attack

C1 is the first component of the complement

C1 consists of three components:
1. C1q, a molecule with six rod domains,               
    each ending as a globular head.
2. C1r, a proenzyme.
3. C1s, a substrate for C1r, converted into  
    a protease upon activation of C1r.

leukocytes to the infection site, which become acti-
vated and activate other cells. 

3. Other fragments (C3b and C4b), mark targets 

for destruction by phagocytes.

4. Destruction of a pathogen is mediated by the 
ﬁnal assembly of the MAC, a transmembrane cy-
tolytic pore. 

5. Complement regulators (CRegs; for example, 
CD55, CD46, and CD59) regulate the production 
of  complement  fragments,  accelerate  the  decay  of 
the already produced fragments, and block the ﬁnal 
cytolytic  action  of  the  MAC  by  preventing  its  as-
sembly.  CRegs  are  cell  surface–anchored  proteins 
that protect host cells from unintended damage by 
the  activated  complement  cascade.  CD59  blocks 
the destructive action of the MAC by preventing 
the binding of C9 to C8. CD59 also modulates the 
activity of T cells.

6. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) 
determines  episodes  of  hemolysis  represented  by 
dark urine and anemia, stomach and back pain, and 
formation of blood clots. Red blood cells lack CD59 
and are susceptible to destruction by the complement 
system.  Therapeutic means to prevent or arrest the 
complement  cascade  are  being  developed  to  treat 
patients with PNH.

General Pathology: Inﬂammation
Invading  pathogens  (bacteria,  virus,  parasites  and 
foreign  objects)  can  cause  localized  tissue  damage 
leading to an inﬂammatory response. 

Acute  inﬂammation  is  the  initial  non-speciﬁc 
reaction to tissue damage. If the damage persists and 
the destruction of the tissue (necrosis) continues, an 
immune response  develops with the characteristics 
of chronic inﬂammation. 

When  a  pathogen  is  neutralized  and  removed, 
the  damaged  area  can  be  cleared  and  replaced  by 
tissue with similar structure and function, a process 
called restoration or regeneration, If the damaged 
area  is  severe  and  extensive  or  the  damaged  tissue 
cannot  regenerate,  the  affected  area  is  replaced  by 
scar tissue by a process called ﬁbrous repair. When 
a pathogen persists and an infection process occurs, 
tissue destruction continues and concurrent immune 
responses and ﬁbrous repair take place by the process 
of chronic inﬂammation.

Acute inﬂammation
Two events deﬁne the pathogenesis of acute inﬂam-
mation:

1. Responses of the microvasculature to injury. 
Vasodilation  allows  increased  blood  ﬂow  into  the 
damaged  tissue  (a  condition  called  hyperemia). 
Mast cells, basophils and platelets release histamine. 
Endothelial  cells  release  nitric  oxide  to  relax  the 

smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel wall to in-
crease blood ﬂow. 

Enhanced  vascular  permeability  of  capillaries 
and venules results in the accumulation of ﬂuid, or 
exudate,  in  the  interstitial  space,  leading  to  tissue 
swelling.  An  exudate  is  interstitial  ﬂuid  with  high 
protein content, in particular ﬁbrin. A transudate is 
interstitial ﬂuid with low protein content. An effusion 
is excess of ﬂuid in body cavities (peritoneum, pleura 
and pericardium).

Fibrin  derives  from  fibrinogen.  Fibrinogen  is 
cleaved by thrombin into ﬁbrinopeptides and ﬁbrin 
monomers that are then assembled to form a ﬁbrin 
meshwork. Fibrin provides a framework for the mi-
gration of neutrophils and also induces the expression 
of chemokines, members of the family of cytokines 
that induces chemotaxis in adjacent cells (see Chap-
ter 3, Cell Signaling). Chemotaxis is the mechanism 
that directs the displacement of cells when speciﬁc 
signaling molecules are present in their surrounding 
environment.

 These  microvasculature  events  are  represented 
by  the  four  classical  clinical  signs  of  inﬂammation 
formulated  by  Celsus  in  First  Century  AD:  rubor 
(redness),  tumor  (swelling),  calor  (heat)  and  dolor 
(pain). Hyperemia is responsible for the ﬁrst three 
signs.  Pain  is  determined  by  released  speciﬁc  local 
mediators and ﬂuid compression of nerve endings.

2. Recruitment of neutrophils to the injury site 
(Figure  10-14)).  Chemotactic  factors  produced  by 
resident macrophages recruit neutrophils from cir-
culating blood into the injured tissue.  

As described in Chapter 1, Epithelium and Chapter 
6, Blood and Hematopoiesis, neutrophils migrate to 
the injury site by the process of homing. Homing 
consists in the recruitment of leukocytes (in particu-
lar neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) from 
peripheral blood to speciﬁc sites. 

 Homing is initiated by changes on the endothelial 
surface triggered by inﬂammatory mediators, includ-
ing cytokines (tumor necrosis factor ligand and IL-1) 
produced by resident macrophages and leukotrienes, 
released by mast cells.

Recall that homing is essentially a recruitment cas-
cade involving tethering, rolling, adhesion, crawling 
and transmigration of leukocytes. Tethering, rolling 
and adhesion to endothelial cell surfaces involve se-
lectins bound to selectin ligand glycoconjugates on 
the surface of leukocytes.  As leukocytes are rolling, 
they are activated by their contact with chemokines 
bound to the endothelial surface.

The selectin phase is followed by the crawling and 
transendothelial migration of leukocytes toward the 
extravascular  space.  Integrins  (LFA1  [lymphocyte 
function–associated  antigen  1]  and  MAC1  [mac-
rophage antigen 1]), expressed by neutrophils, bind

Neutrophil recruitment and function in acute inflammation

Neutrophils 
infiltrating the 
wall of appendix 
(acute 
appendicitis)

Hyperemia: Recruitment of neutrophils to an injured site starts with 
an increase in blood flow (hyperemia) and vascular leakage initiated 
by the release of histamine from mast cells, basophils, and 
platelets. A vasodilation effect is triggered by nitric oxide produced 
by endothelial cells causing smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel 
wall to relax. Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin into fibrin 
monomers that are assembled into a fibrin meshwork at the acute 
inflammation site.
Neutrophil extravasation: This process involves tethering, rolling, 
adhesion, crawling, and transmigration on an endothelial surface 
conditioned by pro-inflammatory mediators. Changes on the surface 
of the endothelium are stimulated by histamine, leukotrienes and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor ligand and 
interleukin-1) released by resident macrophages and mast cells 
when pathogens emerge. Chemokines on the endothelium stabilize 
the attachment of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
    Selectins are rapidly synthesized by endothelial cells and bind to 
glycosylated ligands on the recruiting neutrophil to initiate tethering 
(capture) and rolling. Adhesion starts with the expression of the 
integrin LAF1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) and 
MAC1 (macrophage antigen 1) by neutrophils and intercellular cell 

adhesion molecules ICAM1 and ICAM2 by endothelial cells. At the 
endothelial arrest site, neutrophils extend pseudopods containing 
a reorganized actin cytoskeleton. Finally, neutrophils cross the 
endothelium (predominantly between endothelial cells but also 
through an endothelial cell) and the basement membrane within 7 
to 20 minutes, guided by a chemokine gradient. 
   The following neutrophil events occur in the acute inflammation 
site:
      Degranulation: release of protease-like proteins and enzymes 
1
present in azurophilic (primary) granules and speccific (secondary) 
granules.
      Phagocytosis: pathogens are taken up into phagosomes.

to  endothelial  cell  surface  molecules  ICAM  1  and 
ICAM2 (intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 and 2). 
As you recall from Chapter  6, Blood and Hema-
topoiesis,  neutrophils have cytoplasmic azurophilic 
(primary) granules containing myeloperoxidase and 
defensins, and speciﬁc (secondary) granules harbor-
ing lactoferrin and gelatinase. 

Gelatinase  degrades  extracellular  matrix  compo-
nents  to  allow  the  migration  of  neutrophil.  Neu-
trophils  also  contain  secretory  vesicles,  that  upon 
activation, release their contents to the cell surface 
for cell adhesion to integrins.

Neutrophils  can  eliminate  pathogens  by  several 

1.  Phagocytosis,  involving  antibacterial  proteins 
released from cytoplasmic granules into phagosomes. 
2. Release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), 
to trap pathogens to prevent spreading and facilitate 
subsequent phagocytosis. 

A NET consists of a core of DNA-histones and at-
tached enzymes released from azurophilic and speciﬁc 
granules (see Figure 10-14). 

3.  Degranulation,  to  kill  pathogens  directly.  
Protease-like  proteins  and  enzymes  responsible  for 
the production of reactive oxygen species, contained 
in cytoplasmic granules, have the capacity of direct 
killing or incapacitate microorganisms.

Acute inﬂammation

Resolution of acute inﬂammation: ﬁbrous repair
The resolution of acute inﬂammation pursues two 
objectives:

1. The protection of the host from excessive tissue 

damage.

2. To prevent ampliﬁcation of acute inﬂammatory 

responses towards chronic inﬂammation.

Resolution of acute inﬂammation encompasses an 
anti-inﬂammatory phase and a pro-resolving phase.
During  the  anti-inﬂammatory  phase,  anti-in-
ﬂammatory mediators (such as IL-10), are released. 
In  addition,  the  pro-inﬂammatory  activity  of  the 
nuclear factor (NF)-(cid:103)B pathway is down regulated. 
You may like to review details of the NF-(cid:103)B pathway 
in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling, with particular reference 
to inﬂammatory signaling as an alternate pathway to 
necroptosis.

The recruitment of neutrophils to the inﬂamma-
tion  site  is  slowed  down  by  IL-1  and  chemokine 
receptor  antagonists  as  well  as  by  the  clearance  of 
tumor  necrosis  factor  ligand  from  the  endothelial 
cell surface. 

The  pro-resolving  phase  involves  a  switch  of 
the pro-inﬂammatory activities of neutrophils and 
macrophages to anti-inﬂammatory activities. Neu-
trophils  produce pro-resolving mediators, includ-
ing protectins; macrophages secrete maresins (from 
macrophage mediator in resolving inﬂammation). 
Pro-resolving  inflammation  mediators  arrest 
neutrophil  migration  and  recruit  monocytes,  the 
macrophage precursors, to assist in the phagocytosis 
of dead neutrophils and the removal of ﬁbrin and 
necrotic cells of the inﬂammation site.

Healing and tissue repair are stimulated by com-

bining the effects of the anti-inﬂammatory and pro-
resolving phases.

Healing involves the formation of granulation tis-
sue. The damaged tissue is replaced new capillaries 
(angiogenesis),  macrophages  and  ﬁbroblasts.  Con-
tinued  proliferation  of  ﬁbroblasts,  depositing  type 
III collagen, and the acquisition of smooth muscle 
cells by blood vessels (venules and arterioles), result 
in the organization of ﬁbrovascular granulation tis-
sue. Type III collagen is replaced by bundles of type 
I collagen forming a collagenous scar. Basically, the 
ﬁbrin-containing exudate  is being replaced ﬁrst by 
granulation  tissue  and  subsequently  by  a  ﬁbrous 
scar by a process called ﬁbrous repair (Figure 10-15).
In  Chapter  5,  Osteogenesis,  you  studied  how  a 
bone fracture is repaired. The ﬁbrous repair process 
as described above will not provide strong bone repair.
Additional  steps,  including  chondrogenesis  and 
osteogenesis, are required to form mineralized bone, 
the callus, to connect the two ends of a broken bone. 
The callus is later reorganized to restore bone structure 
before the fracture.

Types of acute inﬂammation
Three types of acute inﬂammation, based on the type 
of exudate or effusion, are considered: 

1. Suppurative acute inﬂammation, when neutro-
phils and debris of dead cells predominate and the 
affected tissue is liqueﬁed by neutrophil-derived pro-
teolytic enzymes to produce pus. Acute appendicitis 
and recurring otitis media in children are examples 
of suppurative acute inﬂammation.

Speciﬁc  bacteria  produce    suppurative  acute  in-
ﬂammation  that  can  evolve  into  a  pustule  (at  the

Inflammasomes are intracellular 
multiprotein complexes that mediate 
the autoactivation of caspase-1 or

macrophages, dendritic cells, and 
epithelial cells during bacterial, viral, 
fungal, and parasitic infections, 
leading to the induction of

is  the  predominate  component  of  the  ﬂuid  or  ef-
fusion  deposited  on  the  surface  of  the  meninges, 
peritoneum, pleura and pericardium. A ﬁbrous repair 
process, converting the ﬁbrinous effusion into scar 
tissue, causes the thickening of the affected surface 
and even the possible occlusion of a space (such the 
pericardial space). 

3. Serous acute inﬂammation, when plasma-de-
rived ﬂuid has  a low protein content. The transudate 
of a blister of the skin, caused by a burn, viral or toxic 

agent (poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac), or 
effusion of ﬂuid in pleural, peritoneal and pericardial 
cavities (caused by congestive heart failure or blocked 
blood or lymphatic vessels) are examples of serous 
acute inﬂammation.

Chronic inﬂammation

The persistence of tissue damage caused by a patho-
gen can determine chronic inﬂammation, a process 
in which tissue necrosis and repair are simultaneous 
and persistent for many years. 

A chronic peptic ulcer is an example of chronic 
inﬂammation  determined  by  the  persistence  of  a 
pathogen (Helicobacter pylori), excessive production 
of  gastric  acid  or  the  effect  of  nonsteroidal  anti-

inﬂammatory drugs (see Chapter 15, Upper Digestive 
Segment). 

Added  to  the  characteristic  cellular  and  tissue 
aspects of acute inﬂammation is the involvement in 
chronic inﬂammation of the immune system repre-
sented by lymphocytes and macrophages. 

Macrophages  have  a  dual  function:  they  are 
phagocytic  cells,  clearing  necrotic  tissue  and  dead 
cells,  and  also  antigen-presenting  cells  as  part  of 
their immunologic function.  From a histopathologic 
perspective,  chronic  inﬂammation  displays  ﬁbrous 
repair,  represented  by  ﬁbrous  granulation  tissue, 
overlapping  with  lymphocytes  and  macrophages 
(Figure  10-16).  Lymphocytes,  macrophages  and 

plasma cells are regarded the typical combination of 
chronic inﬂammatory cells.

We have seen that neutrophils are the main effector 
cells in acute inﬂammation. Macrophages, derived 
from  monocytes  in  the  presence  of  interferon-(cid:97),  
have a prevalent function in chronic inﬂammation.
In certain diseases, the granuloma is the hallmark 
of  chronic  inﬂammation,  a  structural  pattern  that 
deﬁnes  granulomatous  inﬂammation.  As  part  of 
granulomas, macrophages  acquire an epithelial-like 
pattern and fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. 
A  granuloma  (Figure  10-17)  consists  of  a  typi-
cal  central  necrotic  zone  surrounded  by  a  la  zone 
of  activated  epithelial-like  macrophages  coexisting 

Chronic inﬂammation

with  multinucleated  giant  cells.  Surrounding  the 
macrophage-containing zone are lymphocytes (CD4+ 
T cells) and then a limiting ﬁbroblast-collagen zone 
establishing  a  capsule-like  boundary  with  the  sur-
rounding tissue. The development of a tubeculous 
granuloma is shown in Figure 10-17.

What causes a granulomatous inﬂammation? 
1. The pathogen can elicit a signiﬁcant immune 
response (lymphocytes interacting with macrophages/
antigen-presenting  cell)  but  without  significant 
pathogenic  potential.  Human  diseases  that  fullﬁl 
this condition are tuberculosis (produced by Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis); leprosy (caused by Mycobac-
terium leprae); and syphilis (produced by Treponema 
pallidum). 

The  physical  and  biochemical  characteristics  of 
the  central  zone  of  a  granuloma  depends  on  the 
pathogen. For example, the tuberculous granuloma 
has  a  central  caseation  soft  cheese-like  mass  zone 
surrounded by scattered multinucleated giant cells 
called Langhans’ cells. The sarcoidosis granuloma, 
displays a ﬁbrosis center and the multinucleated giant 
cells may contain calciﬁed spherical deposits, called 
Schaumann bodies.

2. The nature of the pathogen, a non-biological 
foreign body, such as silicone in lungs, that is resistant 
to the action of enzymes released by neutrophils, or 
an  unknown  pathogen  in  the  disease  sarcoidosis 
(affecting  lungs,  lymph  nodes  [see  Figure  10-17], 
spleen and liver).

Lymphoid organs
Lymphoid  organs  are  the  sites  where  immune  re-
sponses occur. The major lymphoid organs are:

1. The lymph nodes.
2. The thymus.
2. The spleen.

 
Lymph nodes
The function of lymph nodes is to ﬁlter the lymph, 
maintain  and  differentiate  B  cells,  and  house T 
cells. Lymph nodes detect and react to lymph-borne 
antigens. 

A lymph node is surrounded by a capsule, and the 
parenchyma is divided into a cortex and a medulla 
(Figure 10-18). The capsule consists of dense irregu-
lar connective tissue surrounded by adipose tissue. 
The capsule at the convex surface of the lymph node 
is pierced by numerous afferent lymphatic vessels. 
Afferent lymphatic vessels have valves to prevent the 
reﬂux of lymph entering a lymph node. 

The cortex has two zones: 
1. The outer cortex, containing lymphoid follicles. 
2. The deep or inner cortex, housing CD4+ helper 
T cells and venules lined by high endothelial cells. 
The deep or inner cortex is a zone in which mainly 
CD4+ helper T cells interact with B cells to induce 

their proliferation and differentiation when exposed 
to a speciﬁc lymph-borne antigen.

A lymphoid follicle (Figure 10-19) consists of:
1. A mantle (facing the cortex),
2.  A  germinal  center  containing  mainly  prolif-
erating  B  cells  or  lymphoblasts,  resident  follicular 
dendritic  cells  (FDCs),  migrating  dendritic  cells, 
macrophages, and supporting reticular cells, which 
produce reticular ﬁbers (type III collagen). 

A primary lymphoid follicle lacks a mantle and 
germinal center. A secondary lymphoid follicle has 
a  mantle  and  a  germinal  center. The  mantle  and 
germinal  center  develop  in  response  to  antigen 
stimulation. 

FDCs  are  branched  (hence  the  name  dendritic) 
cells forming a network within the lymphoid follicle. 
In contrast to migrating dendritic cells, which derive 
from bone marrow and interact with T cells, resident 
FDCs do not derive from a bone marrow cell precur-
sor.  FDCs are observed at the edge of the germinal 
centers and interact with mature B cells. FDCs trap 
antigens on their surface for recognition by B cells.

Activated  B  cells,  with  high-afﬁnity  surface  Igs 
migrate to the medullary cords and differentiate into 
plasma cells secreting IgM or IgG into the medullary 
sinuses  and  efferent  lymphatic  vessels  (see  Figure 
10-19). 

The  interaction  of  mature  B  cells  with  FDCs  
rescues the B cell from apoptosis. Only B cells with 
low-afﬁnity  surface  immunoglobulin  are  induced 
to apoptosis. Macrophages in the lymphoid follicle 
remove by phagocytosis apoptotic B cells.

Lymphatic sinuses are spaces lined by endothelial 
cells. They are located under the capsule (subcapsu-
lar sinus) and along trabeculae of connective tissue 
derived  from  the  capsule  and  entering  the  cortex 
(paratrabecular  sinus).  Highly  phagocytic  macro-
phages  are  distributed  along  the  subcapsular  and 
paratrabecular sinuses to remove particulate matter 
present  in  the  percolating  lymph.  Lymph  entering 
the  paratrabecular  sinus  through  the  subcapsular 
sinus percolates to the medullary sinuses and exits 
through a single efferent lymphatic vessel. Lymph in 
the subcapsular sinus can bypass the paratrabecular 
and medullary sinuses and exit through the efferent 
lymphatic vessel. 

High endothelial venules (HEVs) (see Figure 10-
18), located in the inner or deep cortex, are the sites 
of entry of most B and T cells into the lymph node.  
The medulla is surrounded by the cortex, except 
at the region of the hilum (see Figure 10-18). The 
hilum is a concave surface of the lymph node where 
efferent lymphatic vessels and a single vein leave and 
an artery enters the lymph node. 

The medulla consists of two major components: 
1. Medullary sinusoids, spaces lined by endothelial 
cells surrounded by reticular cells and macrophages.

the inner cortex of the lymph node.
  When proliferating B cells mature, they stop 
dividing and establish contact with follicular 
dendritic cells (FDCs). FDCs, which do not 
derive from bone marrow, display the specific 
antigen on their surface and attract mature B 
cells derived from the antigen-activated B cells.

Box 10-G | Lymph ﬂow and dendritic cell migration

•   Terminal afferent lymphatic vessels, transporting lymph to the lymph nodes, 
derive from collecting lymphatic vessels.
•  Terminal afferent lymphatic vessels penetrate the connective tissue cortex of 
a lymph node and empty their content in the subcapsular sinus.
•  The ﬂow of lymph into lymph nodes is regulated by smooth muscle cells pres-
ent in the wall of collecting lymphatic vessels (intrinsic pumping activity) and by 
movements in the surrounding tissue (passive extrinsic activity).
•   Collecting lymphatic vessels have valves that allow unidirectional ﬂow of 
lymph and cells (for example, dendritic cells and leukocytes) from lymph node 
to lymph node. Valves prevent the backﬂow of lymph processed in the preced-
ing lymph node.
•  Dendritic cells are highly mobile. They are distributed as sentinels in the 
periphery to monitor the presence of foreign antigens. They relocate to second-
ary lymphoid organs, lymph nodes in particular, to interact with memory T 
cells present in the deep cortex.  An example is the Langerhans cell present in 
epidermis.

2.  Medullary  cords,  with  B  cells,  macrophages, 
and plasma cells. Activated B cells migrate from the 
cortex, enter the medullary cords and become plasma 
cells (see Figure 10-19). This is a strategic location, 
because plasma cells can secrete immunoglobulins 
directly  into  the  lumen  of  the  medullary  sinuses 
without leaving the lymph node.

Pathology: Lymphadenitis and lymphomas
Lymph nodes constitute a defense site against lymph-
borne microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, parasites) 
entering the node through afferent lymphatic vessels. 
This defense mechanism depends on the close inter-
action of B cells in the follicle nodules with CD4+ T 
cells in the inner cortex.   

In Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System, we indicate 

that the interstitial ﬂuid, representing plasma ﬁltrate, 
is transported into blind sacs corresponding to lym-
phatic capillaries. 

This  interstitial  fluid,  entering  the  lymphatic 
capillaries as lymph, ﬂows into collecting lymphatic 
vessels becoming afferents to regional lymph nodes 
(see Box 10-G). Lymph nodes are linked in series by 
the lymphatic vessels in such a way that the effer-
ent lymphatic vessel of a lymph node becomes the 
afferent  lymphatic  vessel  of  a  downstream  lymph 
node in the chain.

Soluble and particulate antigens drained with the 
interstitial ﬂuid, as well as antigen-bearing dendritic 
cells in the skin (Langerhans cells; see Chapter 11,  
Integumentary System), enter the lymphatic vessels 
and are transported to lymph nodes. 

Antigen-bearing  dendritic  cells  enter  the  CD4+ 
helper T cell–rich inner cortex. Soluble and particu-
late antigens are detected in the percolating lymph by 
resident macrophages and dendritic cells strategically 
located  along  the  subcapsular  and  paratrabecular 
sinuses. 

When the immune reaction is acute in response 
to locally drained bacteria (for example, infections 
of  the  teeth  or  tonsils),  local  lymph  nodes  enlarge 
and become painful because of the distention of the 
capsule  by  cellular  proliferation  and  edema. This 
condition is known as acute lymphadenitis.

Lymphomas are tumors of the lymphoid tissue in 
the form of tissue masses. Lymphocytic leukemia des-
ignates  lymphoid tumors involving the bone marrow. 
Most of the lymphomas are of B cell origin (80%); 
the  remainder  are  of   T  cell  origin.  Lymphomas 
include  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (Figure  10-20)  and

Hodgkin’s lymphoma: a B cell lymphoma

Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent 
lymphomas and often affects young adults. A 
characteristic histologic feature of the classic form of 
HL is the Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cell, a 
tumor cell of germinal center B cell origin. The HRS cell 
does not express most B cell antigens, such as CD20, 
CD79A, CD19 and CD22 and immunoglobulins. 
Instead, HRS cells express molecules not normally 
seen by B cells, such as CD30, CD15, CD70, and 
others. 
   In about 40% of cases, HRS cells are infected by 
Epstein-Barr virus, indicating an important role of this 
virus in HL pathogenesis. HRS cells are multinucleated 
or multilobulated with nuclear eosinophilic inclusions.
   HRS cells secrete cytokines that attract eosinophils 
and CD4+ T cells. The latter stimulate the growth of 
HRS cells in the lymphatic tissue.

divide the thymus into incomplete 
lobules.
    By 14 weeks, thymocyte 
precursors arrive from bone marrow 
through blood vessels, after 
interconnected thymic epithelial 
cells form a three-dimensional 
network and macrophages are 
present. By 17 weeks, the thymus is 
beginning to produce T cells.

       Thymic epithelial cells play important 
3
functions in clonal selection and clonal 
deletion of differentiating T cells: 
    1. A common precursor (keratins 5 and 18) 
gives rise to thymic cortical (keratin 18) and 
medullary (keratin 5) epithelial cells.
     2. Thymic epithelial cells express two 
essential transcription factors:  Foxn1 (for 
forkedhead box N1), and aire (for autoimmune 
regulator). Foxn1 is essential for the 
differentiation of thymic epithelial cells. Aire 
promotes the expression of a portfolio of 
tissue-specific cell proteins by thymic 
medullary epithelial cells, which normally do 
not express these proteins. These proteins 
permit the identification and disposal of 
autoreactive T cells. A mutation of the aire 
gene in humans causes autoimmune 
polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal 
dystrophy (APECED). 

non-Hodgkin’s  lymphomas. They  are  clinically 
characterized by nontender enlargement of localized 
or generalized lymph nodes (nodal disease).

The Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cell, found in clas-
sic Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is a large multinucleated or 
multilobulated tumor cell of B cell origin surrounded 
by T cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, and macrophages 
(mixed celullarity). 

Another group in the lymphoma category includes 
the plasma cell tumors, consisting of plasma cells, the 
terminally differentiated B cells. Plasma cell tumors 
(multiple myeloma) originate in bone marrow and 
cause  bone  destruction  with  pain  due  to  fractures 
(see Box 10-E).

  

Thymus
Development of the thymus
A  brief  review  of  the  development  of  the  thymus 
facilitates  an  understanding  of  the  structure  and 
function of this lymphoid organ. 

The mesenchyme from the pharyngeal arch gives 
rise to the capsule, trabeculae, and vessels of the thy-
mus (Figure 10-21). The thymic epithelial rudiment 

attracts bone marrow–derived thymocyte precursors, 
dendritic cells, and macrophages required for normal 
thymic function.

During fetal life, the thymus contains lymphocytes 
derived from the liver. T cell progenitors formed in 
the  bone  marrow  during  hematopoiesis  enter  the 
thymus  as  immature  thymocytes  and  mature  to 
become immunocompetent T cells (predominantly 
CD4+ or CD8+), that are then carried by the blood 
into lymph nodes, spleen, and other lymphatic tissues 
(Figure 10-18). 

The thymus in humans is fully developed  before 
birth. The production of T cells is signiﬁcant before 
puberty. After puberty, the thymus begins to involute 
and the production of T cells in the adult decreases. 
The progenies of T cells become established, and im-
munity is maintained without the need to produce 
new T cells. 

A signiﬁcant difference from the lymph node and 
the spleen is that the stroma of the thymus consists 
of  thymic  epithelial  cells  organized  in  a  dispersed 
network to allow for intimate contact with developing 
thymocytes, the T cell precursors arriving from bone

marrow. In contrast to the thymus, the stroma of the 
lymph node and the spleen contains reticular cells 
and reticular ﬁbers but not epithelial cells. 

There are two important aspects during the devel-
opment of the thymus with relevance to tolerance for 
self-antigens and autoimmune diseases:

1. A single precursor cell gives rise to thymic corti-
cal and medullary epithelial cells (see Figure 10-21). 
The transcription factor Foxn1 (for forkhead box 
N1)  regulates  the  differentiation  of  cortical  and 
medullary thymic cells, which starts before the arrival 
of thymocyte precursors from bone marrow. 

Differentiation  includes  the  expression  of  cyto-
keratins and establishment of desmosome intercel-
lular linkages. In contrast to the stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium of the epidermis, thymic epithelial cells 
form an open network that enables a close contact 
with thymocytes. 

A mutation of the Foxn1 gene produces nude and 
athymic mice. In an analogous fashion to thymic 
epithelial  cells,  Foxn1  regulates  the  differentiation 
of epidermal keratinocytes (see Chapter 11, Integu-
mentary System). 

2. The transcription factor aire (for autoimmune 
regulator)  enables  the  expression  of  tissue-speciﬁc 
self-proteins  by  thymic  medullary  epithelial  cells. 
The expression of these proteins permits the elimina-
tion of T cells that recognize speciﬁc tissue antigens 
(autoreactive T cells). 

The  human  autosomal  disorder  called  autoim-
mune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal 
dystrophy (APECED) is associated with a mutation 
in the aire gene (see Figure 10-21 and Box 10-H).

Thymic  cortical  epithelial  cells  are  involved  in 
the clonal selection of T cells.  Medullary epithelial 
cells are involved in the clonal deletion of potentially     
autoreactive T cells. 

 Box 10-H | Aire gene and autoimmunity

•   The human autosomal disorder autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–can-
didiasis–ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), also known as autoimmune 
polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), is characterized by the autoimmune 
destruction of endocrine organs, the inability to eliminate Candida yeast infec-
tion, and the development of ectodermal dystrophic tissue. 
•  The production of tissue-speciﬁc antibodies and an inﬂammatory reaction 
conﬁned to speciﬁc structures in several organs (for example, retina, ovary, 
testis, stomach, and pancreas) are associated with one of the several mutations 
of the aire gene.
•  The transcription factor aire enables the expression of several tissue-
speciﬁc antigens (e.g., thyroglobulin, insulin, retinal S–antigen, zona pellucida 
glycoprotein in the ovary, proteolipid protein in the central nervous system) by 
thymic medullary epithelial cells. These self-proteins permit the disposal of 
autoreactive T cells in the medulla of the thymus. 
•  In aire-deﬁcient individuals, self-proteins are not expressed, and autoreactive 
T cells are exported to the periphery. The mechanism of self-tolerance is not 
operational, because self-reactive T cells are not eliminated by clonal deletion. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: DiGeorge syndrome 
DiGeorge  syndrome  is  an  inherited  immunodeﬁ-
ciency disease in which  thymic epithelial cells fail 
to develop. The thymus and parathyroid glands are 
rudimentary or absent. The cause is a deletion of genes 
from chromosome 22 (22q11.2 deletion syndrome). 
Patients have congenital heart defects, hypopara-
thyroidism (with low calcium levels in blood), cleft 
palate,  behavioral  and  psychiatric  problems,  and 
increased susceptibility to infections.

When thymic epithelial cells fail to organize the 
thymus,  bone  marrow–derived T  cell  precursors 
cannot differentiate. Thymic epithelial cells express 
MHC class I and class II molecules on their surface, 
and these molecules are required for the clonal selec-
tion of T cells. Their absence in DiGeorge syndrome 
affects  the  production  of  functional T  cells. The 
development of B cells is not affected in DiGeorge  
syndrome. 

The nude (athymic) mouse is a strain of mice lack-
ing the expression of the transcription factor Foxn1 
necessary for the differentiation of thymic epithelial 
cells and epidermal cells involved in the normal de-
velopment of the thymus and hair follicles. The nude 
mouse is the equivalent of DiGeorge syndrome.  

Structure of the thymus
The thymus consists of two lobes subdivided into 
incomplete  lobules,  each  separated  into  an  outer 
cortex and a central medulla (Figure 10-22). 

A connective tissue capsule with small arterioles 
surrounds the lobules. The capsule projects septa or 
trabeculae into the organ. Blood vessels (trabecular 
arterioles  and  venules)  within  the  trabeculae  gain 
access to the thymic epithelial stroma (Figure 10-23). 
The cortex contains thymic epithelial cells form-
ing  an  interconnected  three-dimensional  network 
supported by collagen ﬁbers. Thymic epithelial cells, 
linked  to  each  other  by  desmosomes,    surround  
capillaries. 

A dual basal lamina is present in the space between 
epithelial cells and capillaries. One basal lamina is pro-
duced by the cortical thymic epithelial cells. The other 
basal lamina is of endothelial cell origin. Macrophages 
may also be present in proximity (Figure 10-24). 

Thymic cortical epithelial cells, basal laminae, and 
endothelial cells form the functional blood-thymus 
barrier  (see  Figure  10-24).  Macrophages  adjacent 
to the capillaries ensure that antigens escaping from 
blood  vessels  into  the  thymus  do  not  react  with 
developing T cells in the cortex, thus preventing the 
risk of an autoimmune reaction. 

Most T cell development takes place in the cortex. 
In the outer area of the cortex adjacent to the capsule, 
double-negative thymocytes proliferate and begin the 
process of gene rearrangement leading to the expres-

Histologic organization of the thymus 

The thymus consists of several incomplete lobules. Each lobule 
contains an independent outer cortical region, but the central 
medullary region is shared by adjacent lobules.  Trabeculae, 
extensions of the capsule down the corticomedullary region, form 
the boundary of each lobule.
   The cortex consists of stromal cells and developing T cells 
(thymocytes), macrophages, and thymic cortical epithelial cells. 

MHC classes I and II molecules are present on the surface of the 
cortical epithelial cells. 
   The characteristic deep-blue nuclear staining of the cortex in 
histologic preparations reflects the predominant population of T 
cells as compared with the less basophilic medulla containing a 
lower number of thymocytes.
    Hassall’s corpuscles are a characteristic component of the 
medulla. Hassall’s corpuscles are not seen in the cortex. 

sion of the pre-TCR  along with coreceptors CD4 
and CD8 (see Figure 10-7 and Figure 10-23). 

 Deep in the cortex, maturing T cells are double-
positive (CD4+ and CD8+) and become receptive to 
peptide-MHC  complexes. The  process  of  positive 
selection  of T  cells  now  starts  in  the  presence  of 
thymic cortical epithelial cells expressing both MHC 
class I and class II molecules on their surface. MHC 
class II molecules are required for the development of 
CD4+ T cells; MHC class I molecules are necessary 
for the development of CD8+ T cells. 

T  cells  that  recognize  self-MHC  molecules  but 
not self-antigens are allowed to mature by positive 
selection. T cells unable to recognize MHC molecules 
are not selected and are eliminated by programmed 
cell death, or apoptosis. 

T cells that recognize both self-MHC and self-an-
tigens (produced by thymic medullary epithelial cells 
under the regulation of the aire gene) are eliminated 

by negative selection (clonal deletion), a task carried 
out by dendritic cells and macrophages. 

About 95% of the developing T cells die within 
the  cortex  of  the  thymus  without  ever  maturing. 
Double-positive T  cells  undergo  apoptosis  within 
three days in the absence of a surviving signal; trophic 
signaling enables the progression to single-positive. 
Within 1 week, single-positive cells will be eliminated 
by apoptosis unless they receive a positive signal for 
survival and export to the periphery. 

The medulla of one lobule is continuous with the 
medulla of an adjacent lobule. The medulla displays 
mature T cells migrating from the cortex. Maturation 
of  T cells is completed in the medulla and functional 
T cells enter postcapillary venules in the corticome-
dullary junction to exit the thymus (see Figure 10-23). 
Thymic  epithelial  cells  populate  the  medulla, 
many of them forming Hassall’s corpuscles. Hassall’s 
corpuscles are thymic epithelial cells forming onion-

Histology of the thymus

The functional thymus consists of two cell populations:  
stromal cells and developing T cells.  
   Stromal cells include (1) the subcapsular thymic 
epithelial cells also lining the trabeculae and perivascular 
spaces;  (2) the thymic cortical epithelial cells; (3) the 
thymic medullary epithelial cells that give rise to 
Hassall’s corpuscles; (4) macrophages present in both 
cortex and medulla, involved in the removal of apoptotic T 
cells eliminated during clonal selection and deletion;  and 
(5) dendritic cells of bone marrow origin, confined to the 
medulla. 
    Developing T cells include T cells at different stages of 
maturation:  
   Immature T cells, double-negative T cells, enter the 
cortex of the thymus through blood vessels and proliferate 
in the subcapsular area.  
   Double-positive T cells move to the outer cortex where 
they are confronted with epithelial cells with cell surface 
MHC classes I and II molecules for clonal selection. 
   Single-positive T cells migrate to the inner cortex. 
   The majority of T cells (80% to 85%) are in the cortex. 
The medulla contains the remaining 15% to 20% of T cells 
undergoing clonal deletion (elimination of autoreactive T 
cells).   

Hassall’s corpuscles are present only in the medulla of the thymus and are 
composed of closely packed whorls of epithelial cells representing highly 
keratinized medullary epithelial cells.  
    Hassall’s corpuscles produce cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which 
stimulates thymic dendritic cells that in turn complete the maturation of 
single-positive T cells to optimize negative selection.

like  layers  (see  Figure  10-23).  Hassall’s  corpuscles 
produce  cytokine  thymic  stromal  lymphopoietin, 
which stimulates thymic dendritic cells to complete 
the maturation of single-positive T cells to optimize 

negative selection and ensure tolerance.

 Note that the blood-thymus barrier is not present 
in the medulla and that Hassall’s corpuscles can be 
seen only in the medulla.

General organization of the spleen

1
        The spleen is surrounded by a 
capsule containing collagen, elastic 
fibers, and smooth muscle fibers.
       Branching trabeculae derived from 
2
the capsule enter the spleen 
parenchyma. Trabecular arteries and 
veins are found in the trabecula.
   The spleen does not have a cortex 
and a medulla and it has no afferent 
lymphatic vessels. The stroma of the 
spleen is composed of reticular fibers 
supporting the two major components 
of the spleen:
       The white pulp, consisting of 
3
splenic nodules with B and T cells, 
antigen-presenting cells, and plasma 
cells. 
       The red pulp, consisting of 
4
splenic sinusoids filled with blood and 
plates of lymphoid tissue, the splenic 
cords.  

White and red pulp

        The white pulp consists of four 
1
components: (1) the central arteriole; 
(2) the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath  
(PALS);  (3) a corona formed by B cells 
and antigen-presenting cells; and (4) a  
germinal center.
       The red pulp surrounds the splenic 
2
nodules (white pulp).  The white and red 
pulp interact at the marginal zone where 
most branches of the central arteriole 
terminate in a vascular sinus.
   The red pulp receives a significant blood 
supply. Antigens enter the spleen from the 
blood. This differs from the lymph node, 
where antigens enter through the afferent 
lymphatic vessels. Although the white pulp 
mimics the lymphatic nodules of the 
lymph node cortex, the central arteriole is 
a distinctive feature.

The spleen has two major components with dis-

2. The red pulp.

The  white  pulp  is  the  immune  component  of 
the spleen. The cell components of the white pulp 
are similar to those of the lymph node, except that 
antigens enter the spleen from the blood rather than 
from the lymph.  

The  red  pulp  is  a  ﬁlter  that  removes  aged  and 
damaged red blood cells and microorganisms from

        The trabecular artery enters the spleen through the

connective tissue trabecula (derived from the splenic 
capsule).

        When the trabecular artery leaves the trabecula, it 
2
becomes  invested  within the white pulp by T cells forming 
the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS). The trabecular 
artery is now the central artery/arteriole of the white pulp.

        The white pulp consists of four components: (1) the 
3
central arteriole; (2) the PALS; (3) the corona formed by 
B cells and antigen-presenting cells; and (4) the germinal 
center.
    The white pulp has the structural characteristics of an 
immune component (B and T cells and antigen-presenting 
cells).

         The central artery gives rise to radiating  branches, the 
4
radial arterioles, ending in the marginal sinus surrounding 
the white pulp. 

         Blood from the marginal sinus  and the central arteriole 
5
is transported into the penicillar arterioles, which end in a 
capillary network surrounded by macrophages. The capillary 
network is called macrophage-sheathed capillaries. 

         The macrophage-sheathed capillaries drain into the 
6
splenic sinusoids (closed circulation) or into the stroma of 
the red pulp (open circulation). 

         The red pulp is formed by (1) the penicillar arteriole;

(2) the macrophage-sheathed capillaries; (3) the splenic 
sinusoids; (4) reticular cells forming the stroma of the

circulating blood. It also is a storage site for red 
blood cells. 

Bacteria  can  be  recognized  by  macrophages  of 
the red pulp and removed directly or after they are 
coated  with  complement  proteins  (produced  in 
the liver) and immunoglobulins (produced in the 
white pulp). The clearance of complement–immu-

noglobulin coated bacteria or viruses by macrophages 
is  very  rapid  and  prevents  infections  of  kidneys, 
meninges and lungs.

White pulp is a lymphoid follicle–like structure 

The white pulp functions primarily as a lymph nodule producing B cell clones in the 
presence of T cells derived from the PALS. This function is particularly important 
during bacteremia (presence of viable bacteria in blood circulation) because 
macrophages can trap bacteria and present their antigens to lymphocytes in the 
spleen to stimulate a specific immune response.
        Antigens enter the spleen from the blood (rather than from the lymph as in lymph 
1
nodes) and reach the white pulp through the trabecular artery into the central artery 
and the marginal sinus. The central artery and the marginal sinus are linked to each 
other by radial arterioles.
         Antigen-presenting cells in the corona region detect blood-borne antigens that

are sampled by PALS-derived T cells. T cells interact with B cells and from this 
interaction B cells proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells.

muscle ﬁbers (it varies with the species). 

Trabeculae derived from the capsule carry blood 
vessels  (trabecular  arteries  and  veins)  and  nerves 
to and from the splenic red pulp (Figure 10-26). A 
brief review of vascularization of the spleen, which 
is similar to that of many organs with a signiﬁcant 
blood supply such as the kidneys and lungs, provides 
a useful background for understanding the function 
and structure of this organ.

The  splenic  artery  enters  the  hilum,  giving  rise 
to  trabecular  arteries,  which  are  distributed  to 
the  splenic  pulp  along  the  connective  tissue  tra-

beculae. As an artery leaves the trabecula, it becomes 
invested  by  a  sheath  of T  cells  forming  a  peri- 
arteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) and penetrates a 
lymphatic nodule (the white pulp). The blood vessel 
is designated the central artery (also called the fol-
licular arteriole, because of the nodular or follicular 
arrangement of the white pulp).

The central artery leaves the white pulp to become 

the penicillar artery. 

Penicillar  arteries  end  as  macrophage-sheathed 

capillaries.  

Terminal  capillaries  either  drain  directly  into

The branching of each penicillar artery gives 
rise to capillaries surrounded by macrophages 
and reticular cells. Many macrophages contain 
phagocytosed red blood cells. 
   Macrophages derive from monocytes entering 
the capillary sheath from the blood and 
differentiating into macrophages. 
   The major function of the macrophage 
sheath is to remove aged cells and particles 
from  the blood.

Splenic sinusoid

Plasma cell

Macrophages

Splenic sinusoids in the red pulp consist of rod-shaped endothelial cells arranged 
along the long axis of the vascular space. Endothelial cells are separated laterally by 
narrow slits but associated at their tapered ends by tight junctions. Ringlike strands 
of basal lamina material and reticular fibers surround the splenic sinusoid in a 
netlike fashion. 
   This netlike arrangement enables the passage of red blood cells through the wall of 
the sinus. Plasma cells are present. Macrophages surrounding the splenic 
sinusoids play roles in the uptake and destruction of particles and cellular debris 
present in the circulating blood. 
    The main function of the splenic sinusoid is blood filtration. Recall that 
Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids have a similar particulate blood cleaning 
function.

       Preferential adhesion of 
sickled cells to endothelial cell 
surfaces increases with peripheral 
resistance and causes narrowing 
of the vascular lumen.

Sickle cell anemia is determined by the substitution of normal 
hemoglobin (Hb A) by hemoglobin S (Hb S) caused by a point 
mutation (replacement of the nucleotide triplet CTC coding glutamic 
acid at the mRNA level [GAG] by the CAC triplet [GUG] coding for 
valine) that  modifies the physicochemical properties of the (cid:96)-globin 
chain of hemoglobin. All hemoglobin is abnormal in homozygous 
individuals for the mutant gene, and red blood cells show a sickling 

deformity and hemolytic anemia in the presence or absence of normal 
oxygen tension. Heterozygous individuals contain a mixture of Hb A 
and Hb S, and sickling and anemia are observed when the tension of 
oxygen decreases. 
    Irreversibly sickled red blood cells are trapped within the splenic 
sinusoids and are destroyed by adjacent macrophages. Hemolysis 
may also occur in the macrophage-sheathed capillaries of the red pulp.

1. The central artery or arteriole surrounded by a 

sheath of T cells (PALS).

2. The lymphatic nodules, consisting of B cells. 
Antigen-presenting  cells  and  macrophages  are  also 
present in the white pulp. 

There is a marginal sinus zone between the red 
and white pulps that receives radial arterioles from 
the central artery or arteriole (see Figure 10-26 and 
Figure 10-27). 

This marginal sinus zone drains into small sinu-
soids located on the outer portion of the marginal 
zone. At the marginal zone, blood contacts the splenic 
parenchyma, which contains phagocytic macrophages 
and  antigen-presenting  cells. T  and  B  cells  enter 
the spleen and become segregated in their speciﬁc 
splenic location.

Red pulp
The red pulp contains an interconnected network of 
splenic sinusoids lined by elongated endothelial cells 
separated by narrow slits. Splenic cords, also known 
as the cords of Billroth, separate splenic sinusoids 
(see Figure 10-26 and Figure 10-27).

 The splenic cords contain plasma cells, macro-
phages, and blood cells, all supported by a stroma 
of reticular cells and ﬁbers. 

Cytoplasmic processes of macrophages lie adjacent 
to the sinusoids and may project into the lumen of 
the sinusoids through the interendothelial cell slits to 
sample particulate material.

Splenic sinusoids are discontinuous vascular spaces 
lined  by  rib-shaped  endothelial  cells  oriented  in 
parallel along the long axis of the sinusoids (Figure 
10-28).  Junctional  complexes  can  be  found  at  the 
tapering ends of the endothelial cells. 

Each splenic sinusoid is covered by a discontinuous 
basal lamina oriented like barrel hoops around the 
endothelial cells (see Figure 10-28). Adjacent hoops 
are cross-linked by strands of basal lamina material. In 
addition, a network of loose reticular ﬁbers also en-
circles the splenic sinusoids. Consequently, blood cells 
have an unobstructed access to the sinusoids through 
the narrow slits between the fusiform endothelial cells 
and the loose basal lamina–reticular ﬁber network.

Two types of blood circulations have been described 

in the red pulp (see Figure 10-26):

Interleukin-2, a cytokine produced by helper T cells, induces 
the proliferation and activation of natural killer cells into 
cytolytic T cells. This discovery has been used in adoptive 
cellular immunotherapy of patients with metastatic tumors.
   The simultaneous administration of cytokine-activated 
cytolytic T cells and interleukin-2 induces significant cancer 
regression.

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs, T cells) appear more 
potent than cytokine-activated natural killer cells derived from 
the general circulation.  
   A cancerous nodule contains both tumor cells and active 
cytolytic T cells. Under the influence of interleukin-2, cytolytic 
T cells proliferate and, when infused back into the patient, 
they selectively destroy tumor cells.

2. An open circulation with blood vessels open-
ing directly into the red pulp spaces, blood ﬂowing 
through these spaces and then entering the splenic 
sinusoids through the interendothelial cell slits.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Sickle cell anemia 
Sickle cell anemia is discussed brieﬂy in Chapter 6, 
Blood and Hematopoiesis, within the context of the 
structure of the red blood cell. Here, we focus on 
the fate of irreversibly sickled red blood cells when 
they travel through the narrow passages of the red 

pulp. We also consider the function of macrophages 
associated with the splenic sinuses in the disposal of 
destroyed sickle cells.

When  the  oxygen  tension  decreases,  sickle  cells 
show preferential adhesion to postcapillary venules 
followed by trapping of irreversibly sickled cells and 
retrograde  obstruction  of  the  blood  vessel  (Figure 
10-29). 

An increased destruction of sickle cells leads to ane-
mia and to an increase in the formation of bilirubin 
from the released hemoglobin (chronic hyperbiliru-
binemia).  The occlusion of splenic sinuses by sickle 
cells is associated with splenomegaly (enlargement of

the spleen), disrupted bacterial clearance function of 
the spleen in cases of bacteremia, and painful crises 
in the affected region. Similar vascular occlusions, 
causing infarctions, can also occur in the kidneys, 
liver, bones, and retinas.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Asplenia
Asplenia, the lack of spleen, includes patients with:
1. Surgical asplenia, that may occur in healthy in-
dividuals after trauma or in patients with hematologic 
(for example, hereditary spherocytosis, (cid:96)-thalassemia 
or sickle cell disease), immunologic (for example, im-
mune thrombocytopenic purpura) or tumoral (spleen 
lymphoma)indication for splenectomy.

2. Functional asplenia is observed in  patients with 
sickle cell anemia. Anatomic asplenia by autoinfarc-
tion starts to develop by about 1 year of age and is 
fully established after 6 to 8 years of age.

3. Congenital asplenia, isolated or associated with 
other  abnomalities,  in  particular  congenital  heart 
disease (Ivemak syndrome).

Postsplenectomy  sepsis  is  a  clear  demonstration 
of  the  function  of  the  spleen  in  bacteremia,  most 
commonly  caused  by  Streptococcus  pneumoniae 
(pneumococcus).  Postsplenectomy  sepsis,  a  life-
threatening  infection,  is  manifested  in  an  asplenic 
patient  by fever, chills, muscle aches, vomiting or 
diarrhea.  Rapidly  progressive  septicemia  is  fatal  in 
up to 50% of the cases.

Vaccinations against pneumococci, Haemophhilus 
inﬂuenzae type b, meningococci and inﬂuenza virus 
are recommended for asplenic patients. Adults who 
already have antibodies to microorganisms are less 
prone to bacteremia. Children who have not devel-
oped antibodies are more vulnerable and prophylactic 
antimicrobial therapy is recommended. 

 To a certain extent, the Kupffer cells of the liver 
sinusoids complement the role of the white pulp in 
the detection and removal of bacteria circulating in 
blood. 

  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Adoptive cell transfer
Surgery, cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy are 
strategies for cancer treatment. Yet, it is known that 
the immune system contributes to tumor regression.
Strategies  are  being  developed  to  enhance  the 
immune  response  against  tumor  cells  expressing 
tumor-related antigens. One strategy, called adoptive 
cell transfer (ACT), consists of the transfer of acti-
vated immune cells with antitumoral activity into a 
tumor-bearing host. ACT can also enhance antitumor 
and overall immunity; it has also been used for the 
treatment of viral infections.

Two procedures have been used for engineering 
immune  cells  of  patients  to  recognize  and  attack 
their own tumor. (Figure 10-30): 

1. The LAK cell procedure consists of the isolation 
of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from the 
blood of a cancerous patient and their treatment with 
the  cytokine interleukin-2  (IL-2)  to  induce  their 
proliferation in vitro. Activated LAK cells are infused 
into the patient, together with IL-2. A key issue in 
this procedure is the isolation of lymphocytes from 
the same patient, because the infusion of killer T cells 
from a second patient was not successful. The LAK 
procedure  yields  modest  beneﬁts  when  compared 
with the administration of IL-2 only.

2.  The  TIL  procedure,  which  consists  of  the 
isolation of autologous tumor-inﬁltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs). In this procedure, a tumor nodule is 
removed and the cells are dissociated with enzymes. 
Dissociated cells are cultured with IL-2. This treat-
ment  results  in  the  death  of  cancerous  cells  and 
the proliferation of TILs that have already been in 
contact  with  tumor  cells.  TILs  are  then  returned 
to  the  patient  by  transfusion,  together  with  IL-2. 
A  preparative  lymphocyte  depletion  treatment  is 
administered  to  patients.  About  34%  of  patients 
with advanced melanoma receiving TIL treatment 
had partial or complete tumor regression.

The limitations to ACT are:
1. The use an invasive procedure to obtain tissue 

for collecting TILs.

2. Tumors may not be readily accessible and the 
obtention of specimens can increase the risk of post-
operative morbility.

3. A difﬁculty of the TIL procedure is the isola-
tion  of  sufﬁcient  number  of  TILs  from  all  tumor 
specimens for ACT. 

4. Another obstacle is the cytokine release syn-
drome following ACT, consisting in the sudden and 
massive secretion of IL-6 by T cells and macrophages 
into the blood circulation, that cause high fever and 
rapid drop in blood pressure.

These  limitations  have  been  confronted  by 
modifying genes of any lymphocyte harvested from 
peripheral blood to induce the expression of required 
T cell receptors (TCR)or chimeric antigen receptors 
(CARs) that can recognize cancer cell antigens (thus 
bypassing the HLA-restriction encountered by TCRs 
in some patients). 

A CAR is constructed by  fusion of the intracel-
lular signaling domain of TCR with an extracellular 
antigen-binding domain to enable cytolytic T cells 
to recognize and destroy the tumor cell bearing the 
intended tumor antigen.

Adoptive cell transfer

 10. IMMUNE-LYMPHATIC SYSTEM 347

Essential concepts

Immune-Lymphatic System

• Organization of the immune-lymphatic sys-
tem.  The lymphatic system consists of primary 
and secondary lymphoid organs. 
  The primary lymphoid organs are the bone 
marrow and the thymus. 
  The secondary lymphoid organs include the 
lymph nodes, the spleen, the tonsils, and ag-
gregates of lymphoid tissue in several organs, 
in particular Peyer’s patches in the digestive 
tract (called gut-associated lymphoid tissue 
[GALT]) and in the lungs (called bronchial-
associated lymphoid tissue [BALT]). 

• The main function of the immune-lym-
phatic system is to protect the body against 
pathogens or antigens (bacteria, virus, and 
parasites). The basis for this defense mecha-
nism, or immune response, is the ability to 
distinguish between self-antigens and non-self 
(foreign) antigens. 
   The two key cell components of the im-
mune system are the lymphocytes and the 
accessory cells. Lymphocytes include two 
major groups: 
  (1) B cells, originated and differentiated 
in the bone marrow and responding to cell-
bound or cell-free antigens.
  (2) T cells, originated in the bone marrow, 
differentiated in the thymus, and responding 
to cell-bound antigens. 
   Accessory cells include the monocyte-
derived cells: macrophages and dendritic 
cells. The follicular dendritic cells, present in 
lymphatic nodules in lymph nodes, do not 
derive from bone marrow.

• There are two types of immunity: 
  (1) Innate or natural immunity. This form of 
immunity, which does not require previous 
exposure to a pathogen or antigen, involves 
the epithelial barriers, phagocytic cells 
(macrophages and neutrophils), natural killer 
cells, and proteins of the complement system 
(synthesized by hepatocytes). 
  (2) Adaptive or acquired immunity. This form 
of immunity, which does require previous 
exposure to a pathogen or antigen, can be 
mediated by antibodies produced by plasma 
cells (humoral immunity), or requires the 
uptake of a pathogen by an antigen-presenting 
cell interacting with T cells and B cells (cell-
mediated or cellular immunity).  
  Passive immunity is a temporary form of 
immunity provided by immunoglobulins pro-
duced by another individual in response to an 
exposure to a pathogen or antigen. Active im-
munity is a permanent form of immunity de-
veloped by an individual after direct exposure 
to a pathogen or antigen. Adaptive or acquired 
immunity has the following characteristics: 
  (1) It is speciﬁc for an antigen. 
  (2) It is diverse, because responding cells 
can detect several regions of the same 
antigen.
  (3) It produces memory cells after the ﬁrst 
encounter with the antigen. Memory cells can 
react more rapidly when the same antigen 
reappears. 

  (4) The immune response has a self-limita-
tion; it stops when the antigen is neutralized or 
eliminated. 
  (5) The immune response has tolerance 
for self-antigens. A lack of tolerance results in 
autoimmune diseases. 

• B cells originate and mature in the bone 
marrow. Under the inﬂuence of interleukin-7 
(produced by stromal cells of the marrow), 
a pro–B cell gives rise to a pre–B cell. Pre–B 
cells give rise to immature B cells, which are 
released into the bloodstream as mature B 
cells. Maturation includes the expression of cell 
receptors with the purpose of recognizing and 
binding self-antigens. B cells that bind strongly 
to a self-antigen are eliminated by apoptosis. 
A less strong binding enables the B cell to sur-
vive, complete its maturation, and be released 
into the bloodstream.

• The presentation of antigens by macro-
phages (called antigen-presenting cells) to T 
cells is the basis of cell-mediated immunity, 
and the mechanism of clonal selection of im-
munocompetent T cells in the thymus. In the 
mouse, the presentation of antigens is carried 
out by a cell surface protein complex called 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The 
MHC-equivalent in humans is called human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA). 
  There are two types of MHC molecules:
  (1) Class I MHC (formed by two polypeptide 
chains, (cid:95) chain and (cid:96)2-microglobulin).
  (2) Class II MHC (consisting of two polypep-
tide chains, (cid:95) chain and (cid:96) chain). 
  The coreceptor CD8, present on the surface 
of cytolytic T cells, binds to class I MHC;  the 
coreceptor CD4, present on the surface of 
helper T cells, binds to class II MHC.
   In humans, the class I MHC-equivalents 
consist of three variants, designated HLA-A, 
HLA-B, and HLA-C. 
  The class II MHC-equivalents also consist of 
three variants, designated HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, 
and HLA-DP. 

• In addition to coreceptors, members of the 
immunoglobulin superfamily, T cells have a 
TCR (T cell receptor) complex on their surface. 
  Antigen recognition requires the participation 
of three components: 
  (1) Class I or II MHC.
  (2) TCR.
  (3) Coreceptor CD4 or CD8. 
  The TCR consists of two chains: (cid:95) and (cid:96) 
chains. Each chain has a variable domain (V(cid:95) 
and V(cid:96)) and a constant domain (C(cid:95) and C(cid:96)). 
The rearrangement at random of gene seg-
ments encoding the TCR enables recognition 
of different regions of a foreign (non-self) 
antigen. 

• The maturation of bone marrow–derived 
thymocytes in the thymus requires recogni-
tion by maturing T cells of class I MHC and 
class II MHC, present on the surface of thymic 
epithelial cells, as well as an exposure to self-

antigens and non-self (foreign) antigens. 
  Maturation requires the expression of TCR 
and coreceptors CD4 and CD8 on the surface 
of the maturing T cells undergoing a selection 
process. These molecule are the bases of 
clonal selection and clonal deletion.
  During the maturation process, thymocytes 
arrive at the thymus without coreceptors 
or TCR on their surface (they are “double-
negative” cells). As the maturation process 
advances, they express TCR and CD4 and 
CD8 coreceptors (“double-positive” cells). 
Finally, they become “single-positive” cells 
(CD4+ or CD8+). 
  During the maturation process, T cells must 
be MHC-restricted, tolerant to self-antigens, 
and bind to non-self antigens to undergo 
clonal selection. 
  T cells that do not bind to MHC or bind to 
a self-antigen undergo clonal deletion (they 
are discarded by apoptosis). 
   The ﬁnal test takes place in the medullary 
region of the thymus, where thymic epithelial 
cells, regulated by the transcription factor aire, 
express a number of self-antigens that are 
sampled by the maturing T cells. 
   Mutations of the aire gene are associated 
with the human autosomal disorder autoim-
mune polyendocrinopathy–candidia-
sis–ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), also 
known as polyendocrine syndrome type-1, 
(APS-1). Autoreactive T cells are exported  to 
the periphery and determine a number of 
autoimmune diseases.

• CD4+ Helper T cells, CD8+ cytolytic T cells, 
and CD56+ natural killer cells.
  There are two subsets of helper T cells: 
  (1) TH1 cells, involved in reactions caused 
by intracellular pathogens.
  (2) TH2 cells, involved in reactions caused 
by parasites. 
  After exposure to a fragment of an antigen 
presented by an antigen-presenting cell, the 
population of T cells expands by mitosis and 
recruits B cells. The population of B cells, 
under the inﬂuence of T cells, expands by 
mitosis. 
  Some of the B cells become memory cells; 
others differentiate into plasma cells, which 
secrete immunoglobulins  to neutralize an 
extracellular antigen. 
  Helper T cells are targets of HIV-type 1 infec-
tion and the cause of the acquired immuno-
deﬁciency syndrome (AIDS). 

  An antigen-presenting cell can recruit a 
CD8+ cytolytic T cell (CTL), which undergoes 
mitotic expansion. The cytolytic T cell can bind 
to an antigen-presenting cell (for example, in-
fected with a virus) and cause its destruction 
by the release of the pore-forming protein 
perforin, granzyme proteases, and Fas li-
gand to induce apoptosis of the affected cell. 
  CD8+ natural killer (NK) cells, which do not 
belong to the T cell and B cell types, are not 
activated by antigens—as helper and cytolytic 
cells are—and lack TCR. NK cells are activated 

348

10. IMMUNE-LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

Essential concepts

in response to interferons or macrophage-
derived cytokines.
  NK cells express CD56, inhibitory and activat-
ing surface receptors, and abundant cytoplas-
mic granules containing perforin. NK cells are 
activated when the inhibitory receptor fails to 
be neutralized by class I MHC not expressed 
by tumor cells or virus infected cells. Activated 
NK cells respond by releasing perforin toward 
the target cell and secreting cytokines to acti-
vate macrophages.

•  Hypersensitivity is a distinct immune 
response causing harmful host reactions rather 
than protection against a pathogen. There are 
four types of hypersensitivity reactions:
  (1) Type 1 hypersensitivity, involving IgE and 
allergens leading to the degranulation of mast 
cells or basophils.
  (2) Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions are 
caused by antibodies directed against plasma 
membrane-bound antigens resulting in 
cytolysis. Examples are autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia and Rh incompatibility leading to 
erythroblastosis fetalis.
  (3) Type 3 hypersensitivity is determined 
by the formation of soluble antigen-antibody 
complexes that activate the complement 
system. An example is the Arthus reaction in 
response to intradermal injection of antigen.
  (4) Type 4 hypersensitivity, also called 
delayed hypersensitivity, involves antigen–T 
cell–macrophage interactions determining 
the formation of a granuloma. The Mantoux 
reaction in the tuberculin skin test is a classic 
delayed hypersensitivity reaction. 

•  The complement system enables the de-
struction of pathogens by a mechanism known 
as opsonization. Proteins of the complement 
system, most of them produced by hepato-
cytes, “complement” the effect of antibodies, 
mannose-binding lectin, and spontaneous 
activation of C3. A number of complement 
proteins construct a membrane attack complex 
(MAC) to induce the lysis of infected cells.
   Complement regulators (CRegs) modulate 
the activity of  the complement cascade to 
protect unintended bystanders. The CReg 
CD59 is particularly important because it 
prevents the ﬁnal assembly of MAC. 

  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is 
caused by the destruction of red blood cells 
lacking CD59. Unprotected red blood cells are 
destroyed by the complement cascade.  

•  Acute inﬂammation is the initial non-spe-
ciﬁc reaction to tissue damage. If the damage 
persists and the destruction of the tissue 
(necrosis) continues, an immune response  
develops with the characteristics of chronic 
inﬂammation. 
  Two events deﬁne the pathogenesis of acute 
inﬂammation:
  (1) Responses of the microvasculature 
to injury. Vasodilation allows increased blood 
ﬂow into the damaged tissue (a condition 
called hyperemia).  
  Enhanced vascular permeability of capillar-

ies and venules results in the accumulation 
of ﬂuid, or exudate, in the interstitial space, 
leading to tissue swelling.  
  An exudate is interstitial ﬂuid with high 
protein content, in particular ﬁbrin. Fibrin 
derives from ﬁbrinogen. Fibrinogen is cleaved 
by thrombin into ﬁbrinopeptides and ﬁbrin 
monomers that are then assembled to form a 
ﬁbrin meshwork. 
  A transudate is interstitial ﬂuid with low 
protein content. An effusion is excess of ﬂuid 
in body cavities (peritoneum, pleura and 
pericardium).
  These microvasculature events are represent-
ed by the four classical clinical signs: 
  (1) Rubor (redness).
  (2) Tumor (swelling).
  (3) Calor (heat).
  (4) Dolor (pain). 
  Hyperemia is responsible for the ﬁrst three 
signs. Pain is determined by released speciﬁc 
local mediators and ﬂuid compression of nerve 
endings.
  (2) Recruitment of neutrophils to the 
injury site. Chemotactic factors produced by 
resident macrophages recruit neutrophils from 
circulating blood into the injured tissue. Neu-
trophils can eliminate pathogens by several 
mechanisms:
  (1) Phagocytosis, involving antibacterial 
proteins released from cytoplasmic granules 
into phagosomes. 
  (2) Release of neutrophil extracellular traps 
(NETs), to trap pathogens to prevent spreading 
and facilitate subsequent phagocytosis. A NET 
consists of a core of DNA-histones and at-
tached enzymes released from azurophilic and 
speciﬁc granules. 
  (3) Degranulation, to kill pathogens directly.  
Protease-like proteins and enzymes respon-
sible for the production of reactive oxygen 
species, contained in cytoplasmic granules, 
have the capacity of direct killing or incapaci-
tate microorganisms.

  The resolution of acute inﬂammation pursues 
two objectives:
  (1) The protection of the host from excessive 
tissue damage.
  (2) To prevent ampliﬁcation of acute inﬂam-
matory responses toward chronic inﬂamma-
tion.
   Resolution of acute inﬂammation encom-
passes an anti-inﬂammatory phase and a 
pro-resolving phase.
  (1) Anti-inﬂammatory phase: anti-inﬂamma-
tory mediators (such as IL-10), are released. 
In addition, the pro-inﬂammatory activity of 
the nuclear factor (NF)-(cid:103)B pathway is down 
regulated.
  (2) Pro-resolving phase: It involves a switch 
of the pro-inﬂammatory activities of neutro-
phils and macrophages to anti-inﬂammatory 
activities. Neutrophils  produce pro-resolving 
mediators, including protectins; macrophages 
secrete maresins (from macrophage mediator 
in resolving inﬂammation).
  Healing and tissue repair are stimulated by 
combining the effects of the anti-inﬂammatory 
and pro-resolving phases.

  Healing involves the formation of granula-
tion tissue. The damaged tissue is replaced 
new capillaries (angiogenesis), macrophages 
and ﬁbroblasts resulting in the organization of 
ﬁbrovascular granulation tissue. 
  The bottom line: the ﬁbrin-containing 
exudate  is being replaced ﬁrst by granulation 
tissue and subsequently by a ﬁbrous scar by a 
process called ﬁbrous repair.

  There are three types of acute inﬂammation, 
based on the type of exudate or effusion: 
  (1) Suppurative acute inﬂammation, when 
neutrophils and debris of dead cells predomi-
nate and the affected tissue is liqueﬁed by 
neutrophil-derived proteolytic enzymes to pro-
duce pus. Speciﬁc bacteria produce suppura-
tive acute inﬂammation that can evolve into a 
pustule (at the skin surface) or an abscess, an 
enclosed collection of purulent tissue. Bacteria 
producing localized suppuration are called 
pyogenic (pus-producing).  
  (2) Fibrinous acute inﬂammation, when 
ﬁbrin is the predominate component of the 
ﬂuid or effusion deposited on the surface 
of the meninges, peritoneum, pleura and 
pericardium.
  (3) Serous acute inﬂammation, when plas-
ma-derived ﬂuid has a low protein content.

  The persistence of tissue damage caused by 
a pathogen can determine chronic inﬂam-
mation, a process in which tissue necrosis 
and repair are simultaneous and persistent for 
many years. 
  In certain diseases, the granuloma is the 
hallmark of chronic inﬂammation, a structural 
pattern that deﬁnes granulomatous inﬂam-
mation. As part of granulomas, macrophages  
acquire an epithelial-like pattern and fuse to 
form multinucleated giant cells.

  A granuloma consists of a typical cen-
tral necrotic zone surrounded by a la zone 
of activated epithelial-like macrophages 
coexisting with multinucleated giant cells. 
Surrounding the macrophage-containing zone 
are lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells) and then a 
limiting ﬁbroblast-collagen zone establishing 
a capsule-like boundary with the surrounding 
tissue.
  The characteristics of the central zone of a 
granuloma depends on the pathogen. For 
example, the tuberculous granuloma has a 
central caseation soft cheese-like mass zone 
surrounded by scattered multinucleated giant 
cells called Langhans’ cells. The sarcoidosis 
granuloma, displays a ﬁbrosis center and 
the multinucleated giant cells may contain 
calciﬁed spherical deposits, called Schaumann 
bodies.
 
• Lymph nodes. The main function of lymph 
nodes is the ﬁltration of the lymph. A lymph 
node is surrounded by a connective tissue 
capsule that sends partitions (trabeculae) 
inside the lymph node. The stroma of the 
lymph node consists of a three-dimensional 
network of reticular ﬁbers (type III collagen). 
The convex side of the lymph node is the

entry side of several afferent lymphatic ves-
sels with valves. Lymph percolates through 
the subcapsular sinus and the paratrabecular 
sinus. The concave side of the lymph node is 
the hilum, the site where an artery enters the 
lymph node and vein and efferent lymphatic 
vessel drain the structure.
  The lymph node consists of:
  (1) A cortex.
  (2) A medulla. 
  The cortex is subdivided into an outer cortex, 
where B cell–containing lymphatic nodules 
are present, and a deep cortex, where T cells 
(CD4+) predominate. 
  A lymphatic nodule or follicle consists of a 
mantle (facing the capsule) and a germinal 
center, containing proliferating B cells interact-
ing with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Mac-
rophages are also present. Macrophages take 
up particulate matter from the lymph as well 
as opsonized antigens and also phagocytose 
apoptotic B cells. FDCs have an antigen-pre-
senting function. B and T cells reach the lymph 
node through the postcapillary venules present 
in the inner cortex.
  The medulla contains medullary cords, hous-
ing B cells, plasma cells, and macrophages, 
separated by medullary sinuses, endothelial 

cell–lined spaces containing lymph arriving 
from the cortical region of the node. Large 
blood vessels are present in the medulla close 
to the hilum. 
  Acute lymphadenitis is seen when an acute 
immune reaction occurs in response to locally 
drained bacteria. Local lymph nodes enlarge 
and become painful because of the disten-
tion of the capsule by cellular proliferation and 
edema. 
  Lymphomas are tumors of the lymphoid tis-
sue. Most of the lymphomas are of B cell origin 
(80%); the remainder are of T cell origin. 
Lymphomas include Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. 

• Thymus. The main function of the thymus 
is the production of T cells from thymocytes 
derived from bone marrow. 
  The thymus derives from the endodermic 
third pharyngeal pouch (also the site of origin 
of the inferior parathyroid gland). The thymus 
is surrounded by a connective tissue capsule 
projecting trabeculae inside the tissue. Blood 
vessels are present in the trabeculae and 
capsule.  
  The thymus consists of several incomplete 
lobules. Each lobule has a complete cortex and 

a medulla shared with adjacent lobules. Two 
important features are:
  (1) The lack of lymphatic nodules in the 
cortex. 
  (2) The presence of Hassall’s corpuscles in 
the medulla. 
  Two relevant functional characteristics are 
the blood-thymus barrier, present in the cortex 
of the thymus, and postcapillary venules at 
the corticomedullary junction.
  The stroma of the thymus consists of a 
three-dimensional network of thymic epithelial 
cells (TECs) interconnected by desmosomes. 
TECs derive from a common precursor, which 
gives rise to thymic cortical and medullary 
epithelial cells when the transcription factor 
Foxn1 is active. Inactivation of the Foxn1 gene 
prevents the development of the thymus, 
resulting in the failure of T cell development 
leading to a congenital immunodeﬁciency. 
  Cortical TECs express on their surface MHC 
molecules required for clonal selection. 
Medullary TECs, activated by the aire gene, 
express self-proteins necessary for clonal 
deletion of autoreactive T cells. Mutations 
in the aire gene cause a number of auto-
immune diseases (including autoimmune 
polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal

dystrophy [APECED], also known as autoim-
mune polyendocrine type-1 [APS-1]) because 
autoreactive T cells can reach several organs 
and tissues.

• Spleen. The spleen has a dual function: 
  (1) The white pulp is the immune compo-
nent of the spleen; components of the white 
pulp detect and react to blood-borne antigens. 
  (2) The red pulp is a ﬁlter that removes 
aged and damaged red blood cells and micro-
organisms from circulating blood. 
  The spleen is covered by a capsule consist-
ing of dense, irregular connective tissue with 
elastic and smooth muscle ﬁbers. 
  The capsule gives raise to trabeculae that 
carry blood vessels (trabecular arteries and 
veins) and nerves.
  The splenic artery enters the hilum, giving 
rise to trabecular arteries. As an artery leaves 
the trabecula, it becomes invested by a sheath 
of T cells forming a periarteriolar lymphoid 
sheath (PALS) and penetrates a lymphatic 
nodule (the white pulp). The blood vessel is 
designated central artery or follicular arteriole, 
because of the follicular-like arrangement of 
the white pulp.
  A marginal sinus zone, between the red and 
white pulps, receives radial arterioles from the 
central artery or arteriole.
  The central artery leaves the white pulp to 

become the penicillar artery. Penicillar arteries 
end as macrophage-sheathed capillaries.  
Terminal capillaries either drain directly into 
splenic sinusoids (closed circulation) or ter-
minate as open-ended vessels within the red 
pulp (open circulation). Splenic sinusoids are 
drained by pulp veins, to trabecular veins, to 
splenic veins.
   As you can see, there are two types of blood 
circulation in spleen: 
  (1) Open circulation, in which red blood cells 
enter the red pulp spaces.
  (2) Closed circulation, in which arterial ves-
sels are continuous with the splenic sinusoids. 

• The spleen has distinctive structural features 
that you should remember:
  (1) It lacks a cortex and a medulla. 
  (2) Similar to the lymph node, the white 
pulp is a lymphatic nodule-like equivalent: it 
has a germinal center, a mantle populated by 
B cells, and antigen-presenting cells. Contrary 
to the lymphatic nodule that handles lymph, 
the white pulp has an artery/arteriole sur-
rounded by T cells, the PALS. Consequently, 
the white pulp is populated by the immune 
cells required to trap and process blood-borne 
antigens.
  (3) The red pulp has two components in-
volved in blood ﬁltration and clearance of aged 
red blood cells: 

  The splenic sinuses are formed by rod-
shaped endothelial cells separated by narrow 
slits that allow the passage of cells. 
  They are surrounded by an incomplete basal 
lamina and loose reticular ﬁbers. Therefore, 
blood cell inside-out trafﬁcking is facilitated 
by the interendothelial cell slits and the loose 
stroma.
  The splenic cords separate splenic sinuses. 
They contain macrophages, plasma cells, and 
blood cells. In fact, macrophages in spleen 
start the recycling of hemoglobin of scav-
enged red blood cells resulting in the produc-
tion of bilirubin.
    
  Asplenia, the lack of spleen, includes pa-
tients with: 
  (1) Surgical asplenia, performed in healthy 
individuals after trauma or in patients with 
hematologic (for example, hereditary sphero-
cytosis, (cid:96)-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease), 
immunologic (for example, immune throm-
bocytopenic purpura) or tumoral (spleen 
lymphoma) conditions.
  (2) Functional asplenia, observed in  
patients with sickle cell anemia following mul-
tiple episodes of spleen autoinfarction.
  (3) Congenital asplenia, a rare observa-
tion that can be isolated or associated with 
other abnormalities such as congenital heart 
disease (Ivemak syndrome).

11. Integumentary System

The skin is the primary barrier between the body and the environment. It provides a line of defense against 
microbial pathogens and physical and chemicals agents. Skin integrity requires active defense mechanisms 
provided by dendritic cells, members of the immune system, and the resident keratinocytes, to discriminate 
between harmless commensal organisms and harmful pathogens.  Many infectious and immunologic diseases 
produce characteristic skin changes leading to a correct diagnosis. In addition, the skin has diseases peculiar 
to itself. The skin is of particular signiﬁcance in clinical physical examination. For example, the color of the skin  
may indicate the existence of a pathologic condition: a yellow color indicates jaundice; a blue-gray color may 
indicate cyanosis, reﬂecting a pathologic condition of cardiovascular and respiratory function; a pale color is 
indicative of anemia; lack of skin pigmentation suggests albinism. This chapter describes the organization of 
the skin and epidermal derivatives as well inﬂammatory and tumoral conditions. 

General organization and types of skin
The integument is the largest organ of the body. It 
consists of two components:

1. The skin.
2. The epidermal derivatives, such as nails, hair, 
and  glands  (sweat  and  sebaceous  glands  and  the 
mammary gland). 

The skin has several functions: 
1. Protection from injury (mechanical function).
2. As a water barrier to prevent dehydration.
3. Regulation of body temperature  (conservation 

and dissipation of heat).

4. Nonspeciﬁc defense (barrier to microorganisms 
and housing of immunocompetent dendritic cells).

5. Excretion of salts.
6. Synthesis of vitamin D.
7. As a sensory organ.
8. Sexual signaling.
The skin consists of three layers ﬁrmly attached 

to one another: 

1. The outer epidermis, derived from ectoderm.
2. The deeper dermis, derived from mesoderm.
3. The hypodermis or  subcutaneous  layer, cor-
responding to the superﬁcial fascia of gross anatomy.

Skin is generally classiﬁed into two types: 
1. Thick skin.
2. Thin skin. 
Thick  skin  (more  than  5  mm  thick)  covers  the 
palms  of  the  hands  and  the  soles  of  the  feet  and 
has a thick epidermis and dermis. Thin skin (1 to 
2 mm in thickness) lines the rest of the body; the 
epidermis is thin. 

The surface of the skin of the palms and soles and 
digits of the hands and feet has narrow epidermal 
ridges separated by furrows (Figure 11-1). Impres-
sions of the ridges create ﬁngerprint patterns, useful 
for forensic identiﬁcation.

Each epidermal ridge follows the outline of an un-
derlying dermal ridge. A downgrowth of the epider-

mal ridge splits the dermal ridge into two secondary 
dermal ridges or dermal papillae. Consequently, the 
epidermal ridge downgrowth  is designated interpap-
illary peg. As discussed later, the excretory ducts of 
the sweat glands in the skin open through the top 
of the interpapillary pegs.

Through this arrangement, the epidermis and der-
mis have a tight ﬁt interface at the dermal-epidermal 
junction, stabilized by hemidesmosomes anchored 
to the basal lamina. 

 

Epidermis
We  start  by  presenting  an  outline  of  the  general 
organization  of  the  epidermis  and  its  major  cell 
components that serves as an orientation for a more 
detailed discussion.

The  stratiﬁed  squamous  epithelial  layer  of  the 
epidermis consists of four distinct cell types (Figures 
11-2 and 11-3): 

1. Keratinocytes are the predominant cell type, 
so  called  because  its  major  product  is keratin,  an 
intermediate ﬁlament protein.

2. Melanocytes are neural crest–derived cells re-
sponsible for the production of melanin (see Figure 
11-3). 

3.  Langerhans  cells  are  resident  dendritic  cells 
derived  from  a  bone  marrow  precursor,  acting  as 
antigen-trapping cells interacting with CD8+ T cells. 
4. Merkel cells are neural crest–derived cells in-

volved in tactile sensation.  

Keratinocytes are arranged in ﬁve layers or strata:
1. The stratum basale (basal cell layer).
2.   The  stratum  spinosum  (spinous  or  prickle 

cell layer).

3. The stratum granulosum (granular cell layer).
4. The stratum lucidum (clear cell layer).
5. The stratum corneum (corniﬁed cell layer).  
The ﬁrst cell layers consist of metabolically active 
cells. The cells of the last two layers undergo kera-

tinization, or corniﬁcation, a process that involves 
cellular  and  intercellular  molecular  changes. The 
stratum basale and stratum spinosum form the stra-
tum of Malpighi. 

The  stratum  basale  (or  stratum  germinativum) 
consists of a single layer of columnar or high cuboi-
dal keratinocytes resting on a basement membrane. 
Hemidesmosomes  and associated intermediate ﬁla-
ments anchor the basal domain of basal cells to the 

basement membrane.

The cells of the stratum basale maintain the equi-
librium between cell differentiation and mitotic cell 
division as well as the repair of damage. While some of 
the dividing cells add to the population of stem cells
of the stratum basale, others migrate into the stratum 
spinosum, change from columnar or high cuboidal 
to become polygonal in shape and initiate the differ-
entiation process by starting the synthesis of keratins

that are distinct from the basal cells. The cytoplasm 
contains intermediate ﬁlaments associated with des-
mosomes. Bundles of intermediate ﬁlaments, visible 
under the light microscope, are called tonoﬁlaments. 
Keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum display 
dark  clusters  of  cytoplasmic  material,  keratins  and 
lipids. The stratum corneum, consisting terminally 
maturing keratinocytes, is the outermost layer of the 
epidemis and responsible for the barrier function of 
the skin. The barrier excludes many toxic agents and 
prevents dehydration. 

General Pathology: Wound healing
Skin is an efﬁcient protective barrier against external 
aggressions. If a portion of epidermis is damaged or 
destroyed, it must be repaired rapidly by a sequential 
mechanism called wound healing (Figure 11-4). 

A damage recognition and repair mechanism consist 

of four stages: 

1. Coagulation (the formation of a ﬁbrin-platelet 

clot).

Melanocytes originate in the

from the 8th embryonic week. 
    Melanocytes are the first

     The cell body is located in 
the stratum basale. Cytoplasmic 
extensions of one melanocyte 
establish contact with about 36 
keratinocytes, forming an 
epidermal-melanin unit. 
Melanocytes and keratinocytes 
are not associated to each 
other by desmosomes.

Merkel cells derive from the neural crest.
    Merkel cells appear in palmar and plantar 
epidermis at about 8 to12 weeks of gestation.
    They are tactile mechanoreceptors but may also 
have a neuroendocrine function.
    Merkel cells are associated with the basal lamina. 
The cytoplasm contains granules. A small nerve 
plate is connected to a myelinated axon. Myelin is 
lacking on the short axon segment penetrating the 
basal lamina of the epidermis.

 Langerhans cells

Langerhans cells derive from a bone 
marrow cell precursor and are present  
in the embryonic skin 4 to 5 weeks after 
the arrival of the melanocytes.
    Langerhans cells are found in the 
stratum of Malpighi.
    A Langerhans cell is a peripheral 
dendritic cell of the immune system. It 
migrates to a local lymph node to  
present antigens to T cells to initiate 
responses against foreign antigens.

2. Inﬂammation (leukocyte recruitment).
3. Proliferation (neovascularization and formation

4. Remodeling and resolution.  
Immediately  following  injury,  transcription-
independent diffusible damage signals are in place in 
the form of intracellular Ca2+ increases, ATP release, 
H2O2, electrotaxis (cell migration toward injury site 
triggered by electric stimuli) and nitric oxide produc-
tion  to  induce  cytoskeletal  changes  and  activation 
of  mitogen-activated kinase kinases (MAPKKs) to 
activate the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines (see 
Figure 11-4). Although fast and strong, immediate 
transcription-independent  signaling,  as  a  damage 
recognition step, is not precise.

Transcription-dependent signaling, aimed at the 
formation of temporary granulation tissue, initiates 
the damage repair step. Wound healing starts with 
the  formation  of  a  blood  clot  covering  temporar-
ily  the  open  wound.  As  you  recall,  the  blood  clot 
consists of platelets embedded in a ﬁbrous mesh of 
cross-linked ﬁbrin molecules formed when thrombin 
cleaves ﬁbrinogen. 

Platelets  contain  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
(PDGF) stored in alpha granules. PDGF and other 
growth factors are released when platelets degranulate 

before leukocytes arrive at the wound site. At the same 
time, vessel constriction occurs to limit blood loss. 
While  clot  formation  takes  place,  keratinocytes 
and endothelial cells start transcription-dependent 
damage signaling by expressing cytokine CXC (for  
cysteine-x-cysteine)  and  CXC  receptor,  which  re-
cruit neutrophils and monocytes to the wound site. 
A deletion of CXC receptor gene results in delayed 
wound healing.

Neutrophils arrive within minutes of injury and 
release proinﬂammatory cytokines to activate local 
ﬁbroblasts  in  the  dermis  and  keratinocytes  in  the 
epidermis. Next, monocytes are recruited and become 
macrophages, that produce cytokines and phagocy-
tize pathogens and necrotic material. 

Re-epithelialization  starts  when  keratinocytes  of 
the stratum basale layer migrate from the edges of 
the wound by the formation of F-actin–containing 
lamellopodia. This cell migratory response requires 
the  activation  and  increased  expression  of  wound 
response genes, including several cytoskeletal regu-
lators (Rho GTPases) and calcium voltage channels 
to increase calcium inﬂux to promote changes in the 
actin cytoskeleton.  

As part of the wound response gene machinery, 
ﬁbroblasts migrate from the adjacent tissue and lay

Microabscess in

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory 
epidermal-dermal disease characterized by:
1. Persistent hyperplasia of the epidermis by abnormal cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Keratinocytes move from the 
basal layer to the superficial layer in 3 to 5 days, instead of 
the 28 to 30 days in normal skin. The stratum granulosum 
may be absent.
2. Abnormal angiogenesis in the dermis capillary plexus. 
Blood vessels are dilated and convoluted.
3. Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the epidermis and 
dermis, in particular activated TH17 cells. Neutrophils 
migrate to the epidermis and form microabscesses.

antimicrobial peptides and chemokines (including CCL20), that recruit

down type III collagen and other extracellular matrix 
proteins. New blood vessels develop (angiogenic re-
sponse marked by vascular endothelial growth factor) 
and organize granulation tissue. The pink granular 
appearance of the granulation tissue is determined by 

the formation of numerous blood capillaries.

Leading edge keratinocytes facilitate their displace-
ment  by  disrupting    hemidesmosome  attachment 
to the basal lamina and by dissolving the ﬁbrin clot 
barrier. To accomplish the dissolution of the ﬁbrin 
clot, keratinocytes up-regulate the expression of plas-
minogen activator to convert plasminogen within the 
clot into the ﬁbrinolytic enzyme plasmin.

Keratinocytes become free from hemidesmosome 
anchorage with the help of members of the matrix 
metalloproteinase  family  (MMP-2  and  MMP-9)  
and downregulation of the tissue inhibitors of me-
talloproteinases, TIMP-1  and TIMP-2,  produced 
by ﬁbroblasts in the dermis. We discuss  MMPs and

After  the  wound  surface  has  been  covered  by  a 
monolayer  of  keratinocytes,  a  new  stratiﬁed  squa-
mous epithelium is established from the margin of 
the wound toward the center. New hemidesmosomes 
are  formed  with  the  inactivation  of  matrix  metal-
loproteinases.

Remodeling  and  resolution  start  within  3  to  4 
days  after  the  wound  injury. The  underlying  con-
nective tissue of the dermis contracts, bringing the 
wound margins toward one another. Macrophages, 
together  with  matrix  metalloproteinases  produced 
by  ﬁbroblasts,  remove  the  granulation  tissue  and

a number of ﬁbroblasts change into myoﬁbroblasts

takes place, and healing with a scar occurs.

 Retinol (vitamin A) is a precursor of retinoic acid, 
a hormone-like agent required for the differentiation 
of  epithelia,  including  epidermis.  Retinoids  have 
a  proliferative  effect  on  the  epidermis  of  normal 
skin. This effect is mediated at the messenger RNA 
(mRNA) level  by inhibiting cell differentiation and 
stimulating cell proliferation.

Retinoic acid binds to cellular retinoic acid binding
(CRAB) proteins, presumably involved in the regula-
tion of the intracellular concentration of retinoic acid. 
Similar to steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoic acid 
binds to two types of nuclear receptors: retinoic acid 
receptors (RARs), and rexinoid receptors (RXRs).  
The  RAR/RXR  heterodimer  complex  has  bind-
ing  afﬁnity  for  retinoic  acid–responsive  elements 
(RAREs)  on  DNA  and  controls  the  expression  of 
retinoic acid responsive genes. Retinoids are used in 
the prevention of acne scarring, psoriasis, and other 
scaling diseases of the skin.

Differentiation of a keratinocyte
Keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum have a ﬂat-
tened polygonal shape with a distinct ovoid nucleus. 
The cytoplasm displays small granules with a lamellar 
core, called membrane-coating granules, or lamellar 
bodies. Bundles of keratin intermediate ﬁlaments ex-
tend into the cytoplasmic spinous-like processes and 
attach to the dense plaque of a desmosome.

The stratum granulosum consists of a multilay-
ered  assembly  of  ﬂattened  nucleated  keratinocytes 
with characteristic, irregularly shaped keratohyalin 
granules (containing proﬁlaggrin) without a limiting 
membrane and associated with keratin intermediate 
ﬁlaments. The lamellar bodies, which ﬁrst appear in 
keratinocytes  of  the  stratum  spinosum,  increase  in 
number in the stratum granulosum, and the lamel-
lar product, the glycolipid acylglucosylceramide, is 
released into the intercellular spaces (Figure 11-6). 
Tight junctions, containing claudin-1 and clau-

•   The process of melanocyte differentiation is regulated by MITF.  MITF 
has two major roles: (1) melanocyte cell cycle arrest and (2) to stimulate  the 
expression of genes encoding proteins involved in melanin production.
•   Binding of(cid:3)(cid:95)-MSH to MC1R stimulates cAMP production, which activates the 
gene expression of MITF after binding to CREB.  MITF translocates to the cyto-
plasm of the melanocyte, is phosphorylated by the ERK pathway, returns to the 
cell nucleus, and increases the expression of proteins to arrest the melanocyte 
cell cycle, extend cell survival, and produce melanin.

accounts for 4% of  skin malignant tumors and is responsible for 80% of deaths

a characteristic of the stratum corneum.  

The keratin-ﬁlaggrin complex is deposited on the 
inside of the plasma membrane forming a structure 
called the corniﬁed cell envelope (see Figure 11-7). 
Additional proteins, involucrin, small proline–rich 
proteins (SPRs), trichohyalin (THH) and loricrin, 
are  cross-linked  by  several  transglutaminases  (T1, 
T3 and T5)and reinforce the corniﬁed cell envelope 
just beneath the plasma membrane at the desmosome 
location sites. On the outside of the cell, a complex 
of insoluble lipids (ceramides, fatty acids and choles-
terol) extruded from lamellar bodies cross-link with 
proteins of the cell envelope, forming the compound 
corniﬁed cell envelope. 

In summary, the plasma membrane of keratino-
cytes of the stratum corneum consists of a corniﬁed 
cell  envelope  containing  a  keratin-ﬁlaggrin  matrix 
associated  to  a  reinforcing  involucrin–SPRs–loric-
rin–THH complex whose development is catalyzed 
by transglutaminases. Extracellular insoluble lipids, 
cross-linked to involucrin, make the cell membrane 
impermeable to ﬂuids (permeability barrier). The cor-
niﬁed cell envelope provides elasticity and mechanical 
resistance  to  dead  cell  remnants  in  the  uppermost 
layer of the epidermis. See Box 11-A for corniﬁed 
cell envelope disorders.

a highly resistant compound cell envelope. Squames 
are sloughed from the surface of the epidermis and 
are replaced by keratinocytes of the inner strata.

Two additional characteristics of the epidermis are:
1. The  cell  layer–speciﬁc  expression  of  keratins 
observed during differentiation of  keratinocytes (see 
Figure 11-6).

2. The  presence  of  three  types  of  junctions  re-
sponsible for intercellular adhesion and cohesion of 
the epidermal cell layer: tight junctions, containing 
F-actin,  and  desmosomes  and  hemidesmosomes, 
containing keratin intermediate ﬁlaments. 

A  signiﬁcant  change  at  the  transition  between 
cells  of  the  stratum  granulosum  and  the  stratum 
corneum is the integration of the desmosomal cy-
toplasmic plaques into the corniﬁed cell envelope 
(see Figure 11-8). These modiﬁed desmosomes, called 
corneodesmosomes,  contain  in  the  extracellular 
space  desmoglein-1  and  desmocollin-1,  members 
of the Ca2+-dependent cadherin family, and another 
constituent, corneodesmosin. A proteolytic process 

in the upper stratum corneum, presumably involving 
cathepsin and calpain enzymes, disrupts corneodes-
mosin, thus allowing desquamation. Keep in mind 
that the loss of nuclei and mitochondria during the 
stratum  granulosum-stratum  corneum  transition 
requires proteolytic processing.

Deregulation of cell adhesion in the epidermis is 
observed in blistering, epidermolytic, and proliferative 
diseases (see Box 11-B).

Melanocytes
Melanocytes are branching cells located in the stra-
tum basale of the epidermis (Figure 11-9; see Figure 
11-3). Melanocytes derive from melanoblasts, a cell 
precursor migrating from the neural crest. 

The development of the melanoblast into melano-
cytes is under the control of the ligand stem cell factor 
interacting  with  the  c-kit  receptor,  a  membrane-
bound tyrosine kinase.  

The development of mast cells, primordial germinal 
cells, and hematopoietic stem cells is also dependent

Melanocytes enter the developing epidermis and 
remain  as  independent  cells  without  desmosome 
attachment  to  the  differentiating  keratinocytes. 
The turnover of melanocytes is slower than that of 
keratinocytes.

Melanocytes  produce  melanin,  contained  in 
melanosomes, which are transferred to neighboring 
keratinocytes through their branching cell processes, 
called melanocyte dendrites, and released by cyto-
crine secretion (Figure 11-10; see Box 11-C). 

Melanins  are  pigments  that  provide  the  skin 
and hairs (by cell transfer) and eyes (for storage  in 
pigmented epithelia of the retina and ciliary body 
and  iris)  with  color  and  photoprotection  against 

ionizing radiation. Melanins consist of copolymers 
of black and brown eumelanins and red and yellow 
pheomelanins.

Melanosomes develop and mature in melanocytes 

through four distinct stages:

1. During the ﬁrst and second stages, premelano-
somes, derived from the early endosome compart-
ment by a sorting mechanism driven by membrane-
bound adaptor proteins-3 and -1 (AP-3 and AP-1), 
contain  PMEL  ﬁbrils  but  lack  melanin  pigment. 
PMEL ﬁbrils are cleaved to M(cid:95) and M(cid:96) fragments 
by  the  enzyme  proprotein  convertase.  M(cid:95)(cid:3) frag-
ments begin to form melanoﬁlaments, the scaffold 
for  melanin  deposition.  Protein  AP-3–depending

2. The third stage starts once the melanoﬁlaments 
are fully formed and the synthesis of melanin starts 
within the premelanosome by the activity of melanin 
biosynthetic enzymes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related 
protein-1  and  DOPAchrome  tautomerase,  also 
sorted as cargo from AP-3–coated endosomal buds 
to premelanosomes.  

Melanin is produced by oxidation of tyrosine to 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Oxidation is 
catalyzed by tyrosinase, whose activity is modulated 
by tyrosinase-related protein-1. DOPA is then trans-
formed to eumelanin, which accumulates on the pre-
assembled M(cid:95)-containing melanoﬁlament scaffold. 
3. The fourth stage is completed when the internal 
ﬁbrillar structure of the premelanosome is masked by 
deposits of melanin and melanosomes are transported 
along microtubules by the motor protein kinesin.  
to actin-containing melanocyte dendritic tips to be 
transferred to adjacent keratinocytes, 

Melanosome transfer occurs when melanophilin, 
an  adapter  protein,  binds  to  Rab27a,  a  protein 
inserted in the melanosome membrane (Figure 11-
11). The  F-actin–based  molecular  motor  myosin 
Va binds to the Rab27a-melanophilin complex and 
transports the melanosome to the plasma membrane. 
Extruded melanin by exocytosis is captured by ad-

jacent keratinocytes and internalized by endocytosis.  
The molecular characteristics of  the unconventional 
myosin V are discussed in Chapter 1, Epithelium.

Albinism  results  from  the  inability  of  cells  to 
form  melanin.  Griscelli  syndrome  is  determined 
by mutations of the myosin Va gene. Patients with 
Griscelli syndrome have silvery hair, partial albinism, 
occasional neurologic defects, and immunodeﬁciency 
(due to a defective vesicular transport and secretion 
in cytolytic T cells).  Similar pigmentation disorders 
are  determined  by  mutations  in  the  Rab27a  and 
melanophilin genes.

Langerhans cells (dendritic cells)
Langerhans  cells  are  bone  marrow–derived  cells 
present in the epidermis as immunologic sentinels, 
involved  in  immune  responses,  in  particular  the 
presentation of antigens to T cells (Figure 11-12).

Langerhans cells, containing an epidermal antigen, 
enter a lymphatic vessel in the dermis and migrate to 
a regional lymph node where they interact with T cells 
in the deep cortex (T cell zone). T cells, activated by 
the epidermal antigen, reenter the blood circulation, 
reach the site where the epidermal antigen is present, 
and release proinﬂammatory cytokines in an attempt 
to neutralize the antigen. 

Similar  to  melanocytes,  Langerhans  cells  have 
cytoplasmic  processes  (dendritic  cells)  extending 
among keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum without 
establishing  desmosomal contact but associating with

keratinocytes through E-cadherin. Langerhans cells 
express CD1a, a cell surface marker. CD1a mediates 
the presentation of nonpeptide antigens (for example, 
(cid:95)-galactosylceramide) to T cells.

The nucleus of a Langerhans cell is indented, and 
the cytoplasm contains characteristic tennis racket–
shaped inclusions (Birbeck granules) associated with 
the protein langerin. Langerin is a transmembrane 
C-type  lectin  (calcium-dependent  protein  with  a 
carbohydrate-recognition domain) that facilitates the 
uptake of mannose-containing microbial fragments 
for their delivery to the endosomal compartment.  
Langerhans cells use CD1a and langerin to trigger 
cellular immune responses to Mycobacterium leprae, 
the causative agent of leprosy, also known as Hansen’s 
disease, a neurologic disease affecting the extremities.
 Myelin-producing Schwann cells are the primary 
target. In the early stages, infected individuals have 
skin nodules (chronic granulomas with multinucle-
ated giant cells) on the face and all over the body, 
followed by paralysis or loss of sensation in the af-
fected  areas, and eventually loss of ﬁngers and toes. 
Blindness occurs in advanced stages of the disease.
Multidrug therapy, consisting of rifampicin, clofazi-
mine, and dapsone, is used to treat all cases of leprosy.

Merkel cells
Merkel  cells  resemble  modiﬁed  keratinocytes,  are 
found in the stratum basale, and are numerous in the 
ﬁngertips and lips. Merkel cells are mechanoreceptor 
cells  linked to adjacent keratinocytes by desmosomes 
and  in  contact  with  an  afferent  myelinated  nerve 
ﬁber projecting from the dermis into the epidermis. 
The nerve ﬁber becomes unmyelinated after passing 
through the basal lamina of the epidermis and ex-

pands into a platelike sensory ending, the nerve plate, 
in contact with the Merkel cell (see Figure 11-3). 

The  nucleus  is  irregularly  shaped  and  the  cy-
toplasm  contains  abundant  granules,  presumably 
neurotransmitters.  We  come  back  to  Merkel  cells 
when we discuss innervation of the skin. 

Pathology: Tumors of the epidermis
A localized proliferation of keratinocytes results in di-
verse group of tumors of the epidermis. They include 
hamartomas (epidermal nevi), reactive hyperplasias 
(pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia), benign tumors
(acanthomas), and premalignant dysplasias, in situ, 
and invasive malignant tumors (see Box 11-D). 

Epidermal nevi are developmental deformations of 
the epidermis, in which excess keratinocytes undergo 
abnormal maturation (hyperkeratosis) and papilloma-
tosis (an epidermal surface elevation). They localize 
in the neck, trunk, and extremities.

Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a reaction 
in response to chronic irritation, such as around co-
lostomy sites and to various inﬂammatory processes 
in the subjacent dermis (for example, mycoses). 

Acanthomas are benign tumors characterized by 
abnormal keratinization , such as hyperkeratosis, dys-
keratosis, or acantholysis (loss of cell-cell adhesion).
An example is the seborrheic keratosis, gray-brown 
lesions of the skin that appear in middle life.

Premalignant  epidermal  dysplasias  have  the 
potential for malignant transformation. This group 
includes  solar  keratosis  on  the  sun-  or  tanning 
bed-exposed skin of the face, ears, scalp, hands, and 
forearms of older individuals. The epidermis is thin-
ner than normal and the normal cytologic features 
and stratiﬁed arrangement of keratinocytes are lost.
Bowen’s disease is an in situ squamous cell carci-
noma of the skin. It is characterized by a disorderly 
arrangement of keratinocytes displaying atypical nu-
clear features. The underlying dermis usually shows 
increased vascularity and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates. 
Erythroplasia of Queyrat is a carcinoma in situ of 
the  penis,  commonly  found  on  the  glans  penis  of 
uncircumcised individuals.

Invasive  malignant  tumors  include  basal  cell 
carcinoma (the most common tumor) and squamous 
cell carcinoma. Melanomas are the most dangerous 
form of skin cancer. 

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) predominates on areas 
of the skin exposed to sun: head and neck. They arise  
from the basal layer of the epidermis and also from 
the external root sheath of the hair, or pilosebaceous 
unit (see below). A remarkable aspect of BCC is its 
stromal growth dependency, a possible explanation 
for the low frequency of metastasis of this tumor.

Genetic factors also have a role in the susceptibility 
to BCC. An often mutated gene in BCC is the patched 

(PTCH) gene, a tumor suppressor gene that is part 
of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (see Chapter 3, 
Cell Signaling). For example, the accumulation of 
the transcription factor GliI (glioma I) contributes 
to the development of BCC.

Squamous  cell  carcinoma  (SCC)  is  the  second 
most common form of skin cancer. Like BSC, SCC  
affects areas of the skin directly exposed to the sun. 
Infection with high-risk types of human papilloma 
virus (HPV). 

For  example,  HPV-16  is  responsible  for  a  sub-
group of SCC of the head and neck. SCC can arise 
from the hair follicle, in particular from cells of the 
hair follicle bulge (see Figure 11-16).

The  typical  SCC  consists  of  abnormal  keratin-
containing squamous epithelial cells extending into 
the  dermis.  Keratinization  and  formation  of  horn 
pearl formations are often seen. 

Melanomas originate in the melanin-producing 
melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. The 
presence and number of large congenital nevi and 
atypical nevi are regarded as precursor lesions.

A mutation in the BRAF  (proto-oncogene B-Raf) 
gene is observed in a large number of melanomas. 
Raf  genes  code  for  cytoplasmic  serine/threonine 
kinases  that  are  regulated  by  binding  the  GTPase 
Ras (see Figure 3-21 in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling). 
All mutations are within the kinase domain of the 
kinase, accounting for the elevated kinase activity of 
the mutated BRAF proteins. 

Figure 3-19 in Chapter 3 illustrates the histopa-

thology of a nodular melanoma.

The clinical features of melanoma are deﬁned by 
the mnemonic ABCD: Asymmetry, Border irregular-
ity, Color variation, and Diameter greater than 6 mm.

There are four types of melanomas:
1. Superﬁcial spreading melanoma is the most 
frequent. It develops at any age on the trunk (men)
and lower extremities (women), and is superﬁcially 
invasive.

2. Lentigo maligna melanoma is similar to the 
superﬁcial spreading type. It it preceded by the in 
situ form called lentigo maligna (an irregular freckle 
that progresses slowly) and, when it becomes inva-
sive, it is called lentigo maligna melanoma. It occurs 
most frequently on the face and sun-exposed upper 
extremities of elderly people.

3. Acral lentiginous melanoma also spreads su-
perﬁcially before becoming invasive. It is  the least 
common  melanoma  among  Caucasians  but  most 
common in African-Americans and Asians.

4. Nodular melanoma is commonly invasive at the 
time it is ﬁrst diagnosed. This type of melanoma dis-
plays vertical growth, in contrast to the three previous 
types that show radial growth (superﬁcial spreading) 
before invasive or vertical growth takes place. 

Dermis
The dermis is formed by two layers without distinct 
boundaries:

1. The  papillary  layer,  consisting  of  numerous 
dermal  papillae  split  by  interpapillary  pegs,  form  
the dermal-epidermal junction (review Figure 11-1). 
The junctional interface is stabilized by hemides-
mosomes  anchoring  basal  keratinocyte  cells  to  the 
basal  lamina.  Loose  connective  tissue  (ﬁbroblasts, 
collagen ﬁbers, and thin elastic ﬁbers) provides me-
chanical  anchorage  and  nutrients  to  the  overlying 
epidermis. 

2. The reticular layer, containing thick bundles of 

collagen ﬁbers and coarse elastic ﬁbers.

Hemidesmosomes on the basal domain of kera-
tinocytes of the stratum basale attach the epidermis 
to the basement membrane and the papillary layer 
of the dermis by a plate/plaque–anchoring ﬁlament 
complex summarized in Figure 11-13. The molecular 
and structural components of the hemidesmosome 
are of considerable importance for understanding the 
cause of blistering diseases of the skin. We discuss  
in  Chapter  1,  Epithelium,  the  clinical  signiﬁcance 
of hemidesmosomes and intermediate ﬁlaments (see 
Figures 1-36 and 1-37).

Hair follicles and sweat and sebaceous glands are 
epidermal derivatives present at various levels of the 
dermis.

Pathology: Epithelial antimicrobial proteins  
As  a  surface  tissue  of  the  body,  the  skin  (of  about 
2  m2  of  surface  area)  is  continuously  exposed  to 
bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites that could act 
as pathogens. 

Epithelial  antimicrobial  proteins  (AMPs)  are 
produced by keratinocytes and sweat and sebaceous 
glands  to  kill  or  inactivate  microorganisms.  AMPs 
are released quickly in response to a disruption of the 
skin barrier and provide a transient protection against 
infection. AMPs include:

1. (cid:96)-Defensins.
2. Cathelicidins. 
Keratinocytes  of  the  hair  follicle  constitutively 
produce high levels of (cid:96)-defensin and cathelicidins 
when compared to epidermic keratinocytes. In ad-
dition,  secretory  cells  of  the  sweat  and  sebaceous 
glands produce additional AMPs and antimicrobial 
lipids  (see  later  in  this  chapter).  Mast  cells  in  the 
dermis store large amounts of cathelicidins in their 
cytoplasmic  granules,  released  top  resist  infections 
after skin injury.

Defensins  and  cathelicidins  carry  out  a  non-
enzymatic disruption the integrity of cell wall or cell 
membrane structures to promote lysis of microorgan-
isms.  In  addition,  defensins  and  cathelicidins  can 
by-pass the capacity of microorganisms to develop

resistance to AMPs by signaling through chemokine 
receptors  (to  recruit  leukocytes  to  elicit  an  acute 
inﬂammatory response) and also involving Toll-like 
receptor  (TLRs)  signaling  (activated  by  micro-
bial lipopolysaccharide to trigger the production of 
pro-inﬂammatory  cytokines)  to  activate  or  inhibit  
inﬂammatory responses. We discuss details of TLRs 
in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System).

Atopic  dermatitis,  rosacea  and  psoriasis  have 
been associated in part to the deﬁcient production 
of AMPs. For example, infection with Staphylococ-
cus aureus increases the production of AMPs in the 
skin.  However, the expression of AMPs is partially 
suppressed in patients with atopic dermatitis during 
skin inﬂammation, triggered by cytokines produced 
by TH2 cells. In contrast, patients with rosacea and 
psoriasis are not susceptible to infection. Keratino-
cytes in these patients produce excessive cathelicidin, 
leading to inappropriate inﬂammatory reactions of 
the skin.

Blood and lymphatic supply 
The cutaneous vascular supply has a primary func-
tion: thermoregulation. The secondary function is 
nutrition of the skin and appendages. The arrange-
ment of blood vessels permits rapid modiﬁcation of 
blood ﬂow according to the required loss or conser-
vation of heat.

 Three interconnected networks are recognized in 

the skin (Figure 11-14):  

1. The  subpapillary  plexus,  running  along  the 

papillary layer of the dermis.

2. The cutaneous plexus, observed at the boundary 

of the papillary and reticular layers of the dermis.  
3. The hypodermic or subcutaneous plexus, pres-
ent in the hypodermis or subcutaneous adipose tissue.  
The subpapillary plexus gives rise to single loops of 
capillaries within each dermal papilla. Venous blood 
from the subpapillary plexus drains into veins of the 
cutaneous plexus. 

Branches of the hypodermic and cutaneous plex-
uses nourish the adipose tissue of the hypodermis, 
the sweat glands, and the deeper segment of the hair 
follicle.

Arteriovenous anastomoses (shunts) between the 
arterial and venous circulation bypass the capillary 
network. They    are  common  in  the  reticular  and 
hypodermic regions of the extremities (hands, feet, 
ears, lips, nose) and play a role in thermoregulation 
of the body. The vascular shunts, under autonomic 
vasomotor control, restrict ﬂow through the super-
ﬁcial plexuses to reduce heat loss, ensuring deep cu-
taneous blood circulation. In some areas of the body 
(for example, the face), cutaneous blood circulation 
is also affected by an emotional state.

A special form of arteriovenous shunt is the glomus 
apparatus. It is found in the dermis of the ﬁngertips, 
under  the  ﬁngernails  and  toes  and  is  involved  in 
temperature regulation. The glomus consists of an 
endothelial-lined  channel  surrounded  by  cuboidal 

368

11. INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM

Blood supply to the skin

pericyte-like glomus cells and a rich nerve supply.  
Glomus tumors are benign, usually very small (about 
1 cm in diameter) red-blue nodules, associated with 
sensitivity to cold and severe intermittent focal pain. 
Surgical excision provides immediate pain relief.

Lymphatic vessels are blind endothelial cell–lined 
spaces located below the papillary layer of the dermis, 
collecting  interstitial  ﬂuid  for  return  to  the  blood 
circulation. They also transport Langerhans cells to 
regional lymph nodes.

Pathology: Vascular disorders of the skin
Vascular abnormalities of the skin are common. Some 
vascular lesions derive from pre-existing vessels rather 
than the proliferation of new vessels (angiogenesis).
There are vascular malformations (vascular ham-
artomas  and  hemangiomas),  vascular  dilatations 
(telangiectases)  and  tumors  (angiomas,  Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, and angiosarcomas).

Local  and  generalized  vascular  diseases  affect 
the  cutaneous  vascular  network  (see  Chapter  12, 
Cardiovascular System). Vasculitis includes a group 
of disorders in which there is inﬂammation of and 
damage to blood vessel walls. Most cases of cutaneous 
vasculitis affect small vessels, predominantly venules.
Noninflammatory  purpuras  (extravasation  of 
blood in the dermis from small vessels) can be small 
(petechiae;  less  than  3  mm  in  diameter),  or  large 
(ecchymoses). Coagulation disorders, red blood cell 
diseases  (sickle  cell  disease),  and  trauma  are  com-
mon causes. 

Acute urticaria is a transient reaction caused  by 
increased vascular permeability associated with edema 
in the dermis. In Chapter 4, Connective Tissue, we 
discussed the mechanism of degranulation of mast 
cells and release of histamine as determinants. 

Sensory receptors of the skin
Sensory receptors are specialized neurons and epi-
thelial-like cells that receive and convert a physical 
stimulus into an electrical signal transmitted to the 
central nervous system.

There  are  three  general  categories  of  sensory 

receptors:  

1. Exteroceptors, that provide information about 

the external environment.  

2.  Proprioceptors,  located    in  muscles  (such  as 
the muscle spindle), tendons, and joint capsules and 
provide information about the position and move-
ment of the body. 

3. Interoceptors, that provide sensory information 

from the internal organs of the body. 

The classiﬁcation of sensory receptors of the skin  

is based on the type of stimulus: 

1.  Mechanoreceptors  respond  to  mechanical 
deformation of the tissue or the receptor itself (for 

example, stretch, vibration, pressure, and touch).

There are four primary mechanoreceptors in hu-

man skin (Figure 11-15): 

1. Merkel disk.
2. Meissner corpuscle.
3. Rufﬁni ending.
4. Pacinian corpuscle. 
The ﬁrst two are located at the epidermal-dermal 
junction; the other two are located in the deep dermis 
and hypodermis. 

Meissner  corpuscle,  Ruffini  ending,  pacinian 
corpuscle,  and  Krause  end  bulb  are  encapsulated 
receptors. Krause end bulb is a thermoreceptor found 
only in specialized regions. 

The nerve ending of the Merkel disk mechanore-
ceptor discriminates ﬁne touch and forms a ﬂattened 
discoid structure attached to the Merkel cell. Merkel 
cells are found in the stratum basale of the epidermis 
of the ﬁngertips and lips (see Figure 11-3).

The  Meissner  corpuscle,  or  tactile  corpuscle,  is 
found in the upper dermis, bulging into the epidermis 
(see Figure 11-15). They are found primarily in the 
ﬁngertips and eyelids. This receptor is well suited for 
the detection of shape and texture during active touch.
The  Ruffini  ending,  or  bulbous  corpuscle,  is 
located  in  the  deep  dermis.  It  detects  skin  stretch 
and  deformations  within  joints. They  also  provide 
feedback when gripping objects and controlling ﬁnger 
position and movement (for example, when we use 
the computer keyboard). 

The pacinian corpuscle is found in the deep der-
mis and hypodermis. It responds to stimuli of deep, 
transient pressure and high-frequency vibration. They 
are  found  in  the  bone  periosteum,  joint  capsules, 
pancreas, breast, and genitals. 

2.  Thermoreceptors  respond  to  a  temperature 
stimulus,  either  warmth  or  cold. The  Krause  end 
bulb is encapsulated but is not a mechanoreceptor. 
It is a thermoreceptor that detects cold. Krause end 
bulbs are found in the conjunctiva of the eye, in the 
mucosa of the lips and tongue, and in the epineurium 
of nerves. They are also found in the penis and the 
clitoris (hence, the name of genital corpuscle).  

3.  Nociceptors  respond  to  pain  stimuli. The 
simplest form of a pain detector are the free nerve 
endings. They derive from the dermal nerve plexus, 
supplied by cutaneous branches of the spinal nerves. 
Sensory nerve ﬁbers extending toward the skin sur-
face, shed their myelin sheaths before branching as 
naked axons between collagen ﬁbers, forming dermal 
nerve endings, or within the epidermis, as epidermal 
nerve endings (see Figure 11-15).

The very sensitive peritrichial nerve endings are 
wrapped around the hair follicle just under the seba-
ceous glands. The myelinated portions of the nerve 
endings form a palisade of naked terminals along the 

Sensory receptors of the skin

jury as we discuss in Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic 
System. Injured cells release chemical mediators, in-
cluding substance P,  acting on local blood vessels and 
nerve endings. Substance P triggers the degranulation 
of mast cells, histamine in particular, that enhances

Bulge stem cells in the bulge region (located at the

independent cell migration pathways:

        In the bulge stem cell–epidermis pathway, 
1
bulge stem cells migrate upward into the 
interfollicular epidermis along the basal lamina.  
Bulge stem cells proliferate within the stratum basale 
and differentiate vertically into the keratin-rich cells of 
the stratum corneum. Squamous cell carcinoma, 
basal cell carcinoma, and hair-follicle tumors can 
originate from cells exiting the bulge following 
activation of specific genetic pathways.

        In the bulge stem cell–sebaceous gland 
2
pathway, bulge stem cells respond to morphogenetic 
signals to generate sebaceous glands.

        In the bulge stem cell–hair pathway, bulge 
3
stem cells migrate downward and give rise to a 
population of matrix cells located at the apex of the 
dermal papilla. These cells are responsible for 
producing new hair.  Regulatory factors (bone 
morphogenetic proteins and Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin 
signaling) released by cells of the dermal papilla and 
neighboring adipose cells, are essential for 
maintaining the proliferative potential of the matrix 
and their differentiation into the various hair cell 
lineages. 

vascular dilation and plasma leakage, thereby  causing 
edema in the injury surrounding area. 

Hyperemia  accounts  for  the  triple  response  of 
Lewis when a line is made on the skin with a pointed 
object: ﬂush (capillary dilation), ﬂare (redness spread-
ing because of arteriolar dilation), and wheal (local-
ized edema).The triple response develops between 1 
to 3 minutes.

In summary, the nociceptive receptors (the pain 
detectors) are found near the skin surface. Merkel 
disks and Meissner corpuscles, ﬁne mechanorecep-
tor, are located at the epidermal-dermal junction so 
they can detect gentle touch. Pacinian corpuscles and 
Rufﬁni endings, the large encapsulated mechanore-
ceptors, are found in the deep dermis and hypodermis 
and respond to transient deeper touch.

Pathology: Leprosy
Leprosy  (lepra)  is  a  chronic  infection  of  the  skin, 
nasal mucosa, and peripheral nerves. It is caused by 
Mycobacterium leprae, an intracellular bacillus found 
in Schwann cells, endothelial cells and macrophages 
of the skin. Nerve lesions result in anesthesia in the 
extremities, claw hand, and foot drop. Acute episodes  
appear during the typical chronic clinical course of 
leprosy.

There are two histologic types of leprosy:

1. The  lepromatous  reaction,  characterized  by 
numerous macrophages in the dermis with intracel-
lular acid-fast bacilli.

2. The  tuberculoid  reaction,  identiﬁed  by  non-
caseating  granulomas  consisting  of  macrophages, 
multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes (T cells). 
Bacilli are difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Granulomas tend to extend  
into the bundles of the cutaneous nerve, destroy the 
sweat glands, and erode the superﬁcial dermis. 

Hypodermis (superﬁcial fascia)
The hypodermis, or subcutaneous layer of the skin, 
is a deeper continuation of the dermis. It consists of 
loose connective tissue and adipose cells forming a 
layer of variable thickness depending on its location 
in the body. 

The hypodermis facilitates mobility of the skin, and 
the adipose tissue contributes to thermal insulation 
and storage of metabolic energy and acts as a shock 
absorber. The  hypodermis  contains  muscles  in  the 
head and neck (for example, platysma). No adipose 
tissue is found in the subcutaneous portion of the 
eyelids, clitoris, or penis.

Epidermal derivatives: Hair (pilosebaceous unit)
Scattered in the epidermis are the hair follicles. Dur-
ing development, the epidermis and dermis interact

to develop sweat glands and hair follicles. 

A hair follicle primordium (called the hair germ) 
forms  as  a  cell  aggregate  in  the  basal  layer  of  the 
epidermis, induced by signaling molecules derived 
from ﬁbroblasts of the dermal mesoderm. As basal 
epidermal cell clusters extend into the dermis, der-
mal ﬁbroblasts form a small nodule (called a dermal 
papilla) under the hair germ.  

The dermal papilla pushes into the core of the hair 
germ, whose cells divide and differentiate to form the 
keratinized hair shaft. Melanocytes present in the hair 

germ produce and transfer melanin into the shaft. 

A bulbous swelling (called the follicular bulge) on 
the side of the hair germ contains stem cells, clono-
genic keratinocytes, that can migrate and regenerate 
the hair shaft, the epidermis, and sebaceous gland, 
forming pilosebaceous units (Figure 11-16), in re-
sponse to morphogenetic signals.

The ﬁrst adult hair follicle cycle starts once mor-
phogenesis is completed about 18 days after birth, 
The ﬁrst hair in the human embryo is thin, unpig-
mented, and spaced, and is called lanugo. Lanugo 

372

11. INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM

Hair

is shed before birth and replaced by short colorless 
hair called vellus. Terminal hair replaces vellus, which 
remains in the so-called hairless parts of the skin (such 
as the forehead of the adult and armpits of infants).
Hair follicles are tubular invaginations of the epi-

dermis responsible for the growth of hair. 

Hair follicles are constantly cycling between:
1. Growth  (anagen) phase.
2. Regression (catagen) phase.
3. Resting (telogen) phase. 
During  the  ﬁrst  28  days  of  the  telogen  phase, 
hair  follicles  become  quiescent  because  of  growth 
inhibitory signals from the dermis (mainly from bone 
morphogenetic proteins). Increased Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin 
signaling  promotes  stem  cell  activation  to  initiate 
the growth of new hair during the transition from 
telogen to anagen. Anagen, catagen and telogen will 
sequentially continue during the life of the individual.
Each  hair  follicle  consists  of    two  parts  (Figure 

11-17): 

1. The hair shaft.
2. The hair bulb.  
The hair shaft is a ﬁlamentous keratinized structure 
present almost all over the body surface, except on 
the thick skin of the palms and soles, the sides of the 
ﬁngers and toes, the nipples, and the glans penis and 
the clitoris, among others. 

A cross section of the hair shaft of thick hair reveals 
three concentric zones containing keratinized cells: 

1. The cuticle.
2.  The cortex.
3.  The medulla (the last is absent in thin hair).
The hair shaft consists of hard keratin. 
The hair bulb is the expanded end portion of the 
invaginated hair follicle. A vascularized connective 
tissue  core  (dermal  papilla)  projects  into  the  hair 
bulb, in close proximity to matrix cells. 

The hair shaft is surrounded by: 
1. The external root sheath, a downgrowth of the 

epidermis.

2. The internal root sheath, generated by the hair 
bulb (the hair matrix cells), is made up of three lay-
ers of soft keratin (which from the outside to the 
inside are the Henle’s layer, the Huxley’s layer, and 
the cuticle of the inner root sheath, adjacent to the 
cuticle of the hair shaft).

The keratinization of the hair and internal root 
sheath  occurs  in  a  region  called  the  keratogenous 
zone, the transition zone between maturing epider-
mal cells and hard keratin. The external root sheath 
is not derived from the hair bulb.

The  hair  follicle  is  surrounded  by  a  connective 
tissue  layer  and  associated  with  the  arrector  pili 
muscle, a bundle of smooth muscle ﬁbers aligned at 
an oblique angle to the connective tissue sheath and 
the epidermis (see Figures 11-16 and 11-18). The 

autonomic nervous system controls the arrector pili 
muscle, which contracts during fear, strong emotions, 
and cold temperature. The hairs stand up and the at-
tachment site of the muscle bundle at the epidermis 
forms a small groove, the so called goose ﬂesh.

 The hair follicle is associated with sebaceous glands 
with their excretory duct connected to the lumen of 
the hair follicle. When the arrector pili muscle con-
tracts and the hair stands up, sebum is forced out of 
the sebaceous gland into the lumen of the hair follicle.
 The color of the hair depends on the amount and 
distribution of melanin in the hair shaft.  Few me-
lanosomes are seen in blond hair. Few melanocytes 
and  melanin  are  seen  in  gray  hair.  Red  hair  has  a 
chemically  distinct  melanin,  and  melanosomes  are 
round rather than ellipsoid. 

A structure that is not recognized in routine histo-
logic sections of hairs is the peritrichial nerve endings 
wrapped around the base of the hair follicle. The nerve 
is stimulated by hair movement (see Figure 11-15).

We discussed earlier in this chapter the participation 
of myosin Va in the transport of melanin-containing 
melanosomes to keratinocytes (called matrix cells in 
the hair bulb) and the lack of hair pigmentation in 
patients with Griscelli syndrome caused by mutations 
of myosin Va, Rab27a, and melanophilin genes.

Bulge stem cell pathways
The interfollicular epidermis is contiguous with the 
external root sheath of the hair follicle, a structure 
responsible for developing the hair shaft. When the 
epidermis  is  lost  in  severely  burned  patients,  stem 
cells  migrate  upward  from  the  follicular  bulge  to 
reestablish the epidermis by populating the highly 
proliferative  and  self-renewing  cells  of  the  stratum 
basale (see Figure 11-16). These bulge stem cells can 
also give raise to hair follicles and sebaceous glands. 
Different  activated  oncogenes  expressed  in  cells 
exiting the bulge can give raise to speciﬁc tumor types: 
squamous cell carcinoma (Ras oncogene activation), 
basal  cell  carcinoma  ((PTCH/Gli1/2  activation  of 
the Hedgehog signaling pathway), and hair-follicle 
tumors (Wnt/(cid:96)-catening signaling pathway). 

There are two signaling pathways that stimulate 
stem  cells  to  enter  the  epidermal  differentiation 
pathway: 

1. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal-
ing pathway stimulates stem cell quiescence during 
the resting stage (telogen).

2. The Wingless (Wnt)/(cid:96)-catenin signaling path-
way is required to stimulate the activation of matrix 
stem cells and initiate hair growth during the transi-
tion from resting to growing stage (anagen).  During 
this transition, the levels of BMPs decrease and the 
BMP inhibitor noggin increases, thus resulting in an 
inhibition of BMP signaling and consequent activa-

and Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin signaling pathways in Chapter 3,

Epidermal derivatives: Sebaceous glands
The glands of the skin are:

1. The sebaceous glands (see Figure 11-18).
2. The sweat glands (eccrine and apocrine sweat 

glands) (Figures 11-19 and 11-20).

3. The  mammary glands. The mammary gland is 
discussed in Chapter 23, Fertilization, Placentation, 
and Lactation.

The sebaceous gland is a holocrine simple sac-
cular gland extending over the entire skin except for 
the palms and soles. The secretory portion of the 
sebaceous gland lies in the dermis, and the excre-
tory duct opens into the neck of the hair follicle. 
Sebaceous glands can be  independent of the hairs 
and open directly on the surface of the skin of the 
lips, the corner of the mouth, the glans penis, the 
labia minora, and the mammary nipple.

The secretory portion of the sebaceous gland con-
sists of  groups of alveoli connected to the excretory 
duct  by a short ductule. 

Each alveolus is lined by cells resembling multi-
locular adipocytes with numerous small lipid droplets. 
The excretory duct is lined by stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium continuous with the external root sheath 
of the hair and the epidermis (the malpighian layer). 
The  oily  secretion  of  the  gland  (sebum)  is  re-
leased on the surface of the hair and the epidermis. 
In addition, sebaceous glands produce cathelicidin 
and  human    (cid:96)-defensins  (BD1,  BD2,  and  BD3), 
endogenous AMPs that enhance the aqueous–lipid 
protective barrier of the epidermal surface.

Epidermal derivatives: Sweat glands
There are two types of sweat glands: 

1. Eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands (see Figure 

11-19).

2. Apocrine (merocrine) sweat glands (see Figure 

11-20).

Apocrine sweat gland

Apocrine sweat glands are found in the axilla, circumanal region, 
and mons pubis.

   The coiled region of apocrine glands is larger (~ 3 mm in 
diameter) than that of the eccrine sweat glands (~0.4 mm in 
diameter).

   Apocrine sweat glands are located in the dermis, and the 
excretory duct opens into the canal of the hair follicle.

   The secretory cells are cuboid and associated with 
myoepithelial cells at their basal surface, as in the eccrine 
sweat glands. The secretory activity starts at puberty. Their 
secretion acquires a conspicuous odor after being modified by 
local bacteria. 
 
   Although called apocrine, because of the incorrect interpretation 
that the apical domain of the secretory cells is shed during 
secretion, these sweat glands release their secretion by a 
merocrine process.

Large lumen of the coiled 

secretory portion

The eccrine sweat glands are simple coiled tubular 
glands with a role in the control of body temperature. 
Eccrine sweat glands are innervated by cholinergic 
nerves. The secretory portion of the eccrine sweat 
gland (see Figure 11-19) is a convoluted tube com-
posed of three cell types: 

1. Clear cells.
2. Dark cells.
3. Myoepithelial cells.
The clear cells are separated from each other by 
intercellular canaliculi,  show an infolded basal do-
main with abundant mitochondria, rest on a basal 
lamina, and secrete most of the water and electrolytes 
(mainly Na+ and Cl–) of sweat. 

The dark cells rest on top of the clear cells. Dark 
cells secrete glycoproteins, including AMPs human  
(cid:96)-defensins (BD1 and BD2), cathelicidin, and der-
micidin. Together  with  the  secretion  of  sebaceous 
glands  and  the  aqueous  product  of  the  clear  cells, 
AMPs are produced  under steady–state and inﬂam-
matory conditions. 

Myoepithelial  cells  are  found  between  the  basal 
lamina and the clear cells. Their contractile activity 
assists in the release of secretion into the glandular 
lumen.  

The excretory portion of the eccrine sweat gland 
is  lined  by  a  bilayer  of  cuboid  cells  that  partially 
reabsorb  NaCl  and  water  under  the  inﬂuence  of

Eponychium

The proximal nail fold is covered by  
an epithelium, the eponychium, which 
contributes to the formation of the 
superficial layer of the nail plate.

The cuticle is the thick corneal layer of the eponychium 
extending on the dorsal surface of the nail plate. The 
cuticle protects the base of the nail plate, in particular the 
germinative matrix.

Nail bed 

Onychodermal 

band

The hyponychium 
represents the union 
between the nail bed and the 
nail plate at the fingertip. Its 
function is to render the nail 
bed impermeable for 
protection purposes. If this 
structure is disrupted, fungal 
invasion produces 
onychomycosis.

Eponychium

The nail bed forms the bed or ventral surface of the nail plate.  
    The nail plate is formed by the flattening of the epidermal cells, nuclear 
fragmentation, and condensation of the cytoplasm to form horny flat cells. 
The stratum granulosum is not present. 
    Normal nail growth is about 0.1 to 1.2 mm per day. Fingernails grow faster 
than toenails. 
    Nail growth is altered in several diseases (for example, hyperthyroidism).

The nail plate consists of interdigitating cells, 
corneocytes, lacking nuclei or organelles.
    Calcium salts are important components of the 
nail plate. In addition, fibrillar and globular proteins 
containing sulfur are also found. 
    The hardness of the nail is due to high sulfur 
matrix proteins.

aldosterone. The reabsorption of  NaCl by the excre-
tory duct is deﬁcient in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis 
(see next section). The duct  follows a helical path 
when it approaches the epidermis and opens on its 
surface at a sweat pore (see Figure 11-19). Within 
the epidermis, the excretory duct loses its epithelial 
wall and is surrounded by keratinocytes.

Apocrine  sweat  glands    (see  Figure  11-20)  are 
coiled  and  occur  in  the  axilla,  mons  pubis,  and 
circumanal  area.  Apocrine  sweat  glands  contain 
secretory acini larger than those in the eccrine sweat 
glands.

 The secretory portion is located in the dermis and 
hypodermis. The excretory duct opens into the hair 
follicle (instead of into the epidermis as in the eccrine 
sweat glands).  Apocrine sweat glands are functional 
after puberty and are supplied by adrenergic nerves.
Two  special  examples  of  apocrine  sweat  glands 
are the ceruminous glands in the external auditory 
meatus  and  the  glands  of  Moll  of  the  margins  of 
the eyelids.

  The ceruminous glands produce cerumen, a pig-

mented lipid; the excretory duct opens, together with 
the ducts of sebaceous glands, into the hair follicles 
of the external auditory meatus. 

The  excretory  duct  of  the  glands  of  Moll  opens 
into the free surface of the epidermis of the eyelid, 
or the eyelashes.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Sweat glands and cystic 
ﬁbrosis
Cystic  ﬁbrosis  is  a  genetic  disorder  of  epithelial 
transport of Cl- by the channel protein CFTR (cystic 
ﬁbrosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator), 
encoded by the cystic ﬁbrosis gene located on chro-
mosome 7. 

Exocrine  glands  and  the  epithelial  lining  of  the 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts 
are affected by a mutation of CFTR. Recurrent pul-
monary infections, pancreatic insufﬁciency, steator-
rhea,  hepatic  cirrhosis,  intestinal  obstruction,  and 
male infertility are clinical features of cystic ﬁbrosis.
The excretory ducts of sweat glands are lined by 
epithelial  cells  containing  CFTR  involved  in  the 

Fingernails

transport of Cl- (Figure 11-21). The CFTR channel 
opens  when  an  agonist,  such  as  acetylcholine,  in-
duces an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP), followed by activation of protein kinase A, 
production  of  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP),  and 
binding  of  ATP  to  two  ATP-binding  domains  of 
CFTR. 

A defect in CFTR in sweat gland ducts leads to 
a decrease in the reabsorption of sodium chloride 
from the lumen, resulting in increased concentra-
tions of chloride in sweat. 

In  the  respiratory  epithelium  (see  Chapter  13, 
Respiratory  System),  a  defect  in  CFTR  results  in 
a reduction  or  loss  of  chloride  secretion  into  the 
airways,  active  reabsorption  of  sodium  and  water, 
and a consequent decrease in the water content of 
the  protective  mucus  blanket.  Dehydrated  mucus 
causes defective mucociliary action and predisposes 
to recurrent pulmonary infections.

Epidermal derivatives: Fingernails
The nails are hard keratin plates on the dorsal surfaces 
of  the  terminal  phalanges  of  the  ﬁngers  and  toes 
(Figure 11-22). The nail plate covers the nail bed, 
the surface of the skin that consists of the stratum 
basale and stratum spinosum only. 

The body of the plate is surrounded by lateral nail 
folds with a structure similar to that of the adjacent 
epidermis of the skin. 

When  the  lateral  nail  folds  break  down,  an  in-
ﬂammatory process develops. This process is called 
onychocryptosis  and  is  frequently  observed  in  the 
nail of the ﬁrst toe (ingrown nail).

The proximal edge of the plate is the root or ma-
trix  of  the  nail,where  the  whitish  crescent-shaped 
lunula is located. The nail matrix is a region of the 
epidermis responsible for the formation of the nail 
substance. The distal portion of the plate is the free 
edge of the nail.

The  nail  plate  consists  of  compact  scales  corre-
sponding to corniﬁed epithelial cells. The proximal 
edge of the nail plate is covered by the eponychium, 
a projecting fold of the stratum corneum of the skin, 
the cuticle. 

A loss of the cuticle facilitates inﬂammatory and 
infective processes of the nail matrix, leading to nail 
plate dystrophies.

Under the distal and free edge of the nail plate, 
the stratum corneum of the epidermis forms a thick 
structure,  the  hyponychium. The  hyponychium 
protects the matrix bed of the nail from bacterial and 
fungal invasion.

Essential concepts

Integumentary System

• Skin consists of three layers: 
  (1) Epidermis. 
  (2) Dermis. 
  (3) Hypodermis or subcutaneous layer. 
  There are two types of skin: 
  (1) Thick skin. 
  (2) Thin skin.
  The epidermis and dermis are tightly inter-
locked. Epidermal ridges interact with dermal 
ridges. An epithelial-derived interpapillary 
peg divides the dermal ridge into secondary 
dermal ridges or papillae. Numerous dermal 
papillae interlock with the epidermal region. 
The dermal-epidermal interface is stabilized by 
hemidesmosomes.

• The epidermis is a stratiﬁed squamous epi-
thelium consisting of four different cell types: 
  (1) Keratinocytes (ectoderm-derived cells).
  (2) Melanocytes (neural crest–derived cells).
  (3) Langerhans cells (bone marrow–derived 
dendritic cells).
  (4) Merkel cells (neural crest–derived cells).
   Keratinocytes are distributed in ﬁve strata or 
layers: 
  (1) Stratum basale (basal layer, which con-
tains stem cells).
  (2) Stratum spinosum (spinous or prickle 
cell layer).
  (3) Stratum granulosum (granular cell layer).
  (4) Stratum lucidum (clear cell layer), pre-
dominant in thick skin.
  (5) Stratum corneum (corniﬁed cell layer).  

  Keratinocytes are associated with each other 
by desmosomes and tight junctions.

• Wound healing. Skin is repaired rapidly to 
maintain an efﬁcient protective barrier. Wound 
healing consists of four stages: 
  (1) Formation of a ﬁbrin-platelet clot at the 
site of injury. 
  (2) Recruitment of leukocytes to protect the 
site from infection. Keratinocytes and endo-
thelial cells express cytokine CXC (cysteine-x-
cysteine) and its receptor to recruit leukocytes. 
Monocytes recruited to the injury site become 
macrophages. 
  (3) Neovascularization and cellular prolifera-
tion. Granulation tissue, rich in blood capillar-
ies, is seen. 
  (4) Tissue remodeling. Keratinocytes express 
plasminogen activator to convert plasminogen 
within the ﬁbrin clot into plasmin. Plasmin and 
matrix metalloproteinases (produced by ﬁbro-
blasts in the dermis) free basal keratinocytes 
from their basal lamina anchorage site and 
re-epithelialization starts. 
  Epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte 
growth factor stimulate re-epithelialization. 
Fibroblasts in the dermis, stimulated by 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and 
transforming growth factor-(cid:96), start to prolifer-
ate. A number of ﬁbroblasts change into 
myoﬁbroblasts, and contraction of the dermis 
occurs (healing with a scar).

• Psoriasis is an inﬂammatory skin disorder 
producing a characteristic psoriatic plaque, 
commonly seen on the elbows, knees, scalp, 
umbilicus, and lumbar region. Persistent 
hyperplasia of the epidermis caused by ab-
normal cell proliferation and differentiation is 
observed. Keratinocytes move from the basal 
layer to the superﬁcial layer in 3 to 5 days 
(instead of 28 to 30 days in normal skin).
  The histologic characteristics of the psoriatic 
plaque are:
  (1) Excessive proliferation of epidermal kera-
tinocytes, caused by an accelerated migration 
of keratinocytes from the stratum basale to 
the stratum corneum.
  (2) Presence of inﬂammatory cells, in 
particular type 17 helper T cells (TH17), 
dendritic cells, and neutrophils in the dermis 
and epidermis  causing microabscesses. The 
proinﬂammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-
17A) is the primary effector of  TH17 cells.
  (3) Elongation of epidermic papillae, and 
prominent angiogenesis. 
  Keratinocytes stimulated by IL-17A undergo 
persistent hyperplasia by abnormal cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Treatment of 
psoriasis is targeted to the therapeutic inhibi-
tion of  IL-17A.

• The differentiation of keratinocytes is char-
acterized by:
  (1) The expression of speciﬁc keratin pairs 
in each layer: keratins 5 and 14 in the stratum

  (3) The presence in the stratum corneum of 
the corniﬁed cell envelope, an involucrin–small 
proline-rich–loricrin protein complex associ-
ated with keratin-ﬁlaggrin aggregates inside the 
cell. The extracellular multilamellar lipid layer is 
anchored to involucrin.
  (4) The presence of desmosomes and tight 
junctions (containing claudin-1 and claudin-4).

• Melanocytes are branching cells located in 
the stratum basale. They migrate from the 
neural crest under control of c-kit receptor, a 
tyrosine kinase, and its ligand, stem cell factor.
  Melanocytes produce melanin contained in 
melanosomes. Melanin is produced by oxida-
tion of tyrosine to DOPA (1,3,4-dihydroxyphe-
nylalanine) by tyrosinase. DOPA is transformed 
into melanin.
  Melanosomes are transported along mela-
nocyte dendritic processes. Kinesin transports 
melanosomes along microtubules toward 

F-actin ﬁlaments located under the plasma 
membrane. 
  The microtubule–F-actin switch involves 
the attachment of the adapter melanophilin 
to Rab27a, a receptor on the melanosome 
membrane. Myosin Va recruits the melano-
some–Rab27a–melanophilin complex, which 
is transported along F-actin tracks and released 
into the intercellular space by an exocrine 
mechanism (cytocrine secretion).
  Keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum take 
up the melanin-containing melanosomes by 
endocytosis.
  A genetic defect in myosin Va, melanophilin, 
and Rab27a disrupts the transport of melanin. 
Griscelli syndrome and its variants determine 
partial albinism, occasional neurologic defects, 
and immunodeﬁciency. 
  Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor 
(MITF) regulates the differentiation of mela-
nocytes (cell cycle arrest, melanin production, 
and cell survival).

• Langerhans cells are dendritic cells of the 
epidermis derived from the bone marrow. 
Similar to melanocytes, Langerhans cells have 
dendritic processes in contact with keratino-
cytes through E-cadherin. 
  A characteristic landmark of Langerhans cells 

is the Birbeck granule. Birbeck granule con-
tains the proteins langerin and CD1a, involved 
in the uptake and delivery of antigens.
  Langerhans cells take up antigens in the 
epidermis and migrate to regional lymph 
nodes, where they interact in the deep cortex 
with T cells. T cells, activated by the epidermal 
antigen, re-enter the blood circulation, extrava-
sate at the site where the epidermal antigen 
is present, and secrete proinﬂammatory cyto-
kines that produce an epidermic reaction.

• Merkel cells are found in the stratum 
basale. They are mechanoreceptors linked to 
adjacent keratinocytes by desmosomes.

• Tumors of the epidermis. They include 
hamartomas (epidermal nevi), reactive 
hyperplasias (pseudoepitheliomatous hyper-
plasia), benign tumors (acanthomas), and 
premalignant dysplasias, in situ, and invasive 
carcinomas.
  Epidermal nevi are developmental defor-
mations of the epidermis, in which excess 
keratinocytes undergo abnormal maturation 
(hyperkeratosis) and papillomatosis. 
  Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a 
reaction in response to chronic irritation, such 
as around colostomy sites and to various in-

ﬂammatory processes in the subjacent dermis 
(for example, mycoses). 
  Acanthomas are benign tumors characterized 
by abnormal keratinization , such as hyperkera-
tosis, dyskeratosis, or acantholysis (loss of cell-
cell adhesion). An example is the seborrheic 
keratosis of the elderly.
  Premalignant epidermal dysplasias have the 
potential for malignant transformation. This 
group includes solar keratosis on the sun- or 
tanning bed-exposed skin of the face, ears, 
scalp, hands, and forearms of older individuals.
  Bowen’s disease is an in situ squamous 
cell carcinoma of the skin characterized by 
a disorderly arrangement of keratinocytes 
displaying atypical nuclear features. Erythro-
plasia of Queyrat is a carcinoma in situ of the 
penis, commonly found on the glans penis of 
uncircumcised individuals.
  Invasive malignant tumors include basal cell 
carcinoma (the most common tumor) and 
squamous cell carcinoma. Melanomas are the 
most dangerous form of skin cancer. 
  Basal cell carcinoma predominates on 
areas of the skin exposed to sun: head and 
neck. They arise  from the basal layer of the 
epidermis and also from the external root 
sheath of the hair, or pilosebaceous unit. An 
often mutated gene in basal cell carcinomas is 
the patched (PTCH) gene, a tumor suppressor 
gene that is part of the Hedgehog signaling 
pathway.
  Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most 
common form of skin cancer. Like basal cell 
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma  affects 
areas of the skin directly exposed to the sun. 
Infection with high-risk types of human papil-
loma virus (HPV). For example, HPV-16 is 
responsible for a subgroup of squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck.
  Melanomas originate in the melanin-pro-
ducing melanocytes in the basal layer of the 
epidermis. The presence and number of large 
congenital nevi and atypical nevi are regarded 
as precursor lesions.
  A mutation in the BRAF  (proto-oncogene 
B-Raf) gene is observed in a large number of 
melanomas. Raf genes code for cytoplasmic 
serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by 
binding the GTPase Ras.
  The clinical features of melanoma are 
deﬁned by the mnemonic ABCD: Asymmetry, 
Border irregularity, Color variation, and Diam-
eter greater than 6 mm.
  There are four types of melanomas:
  (1) Superﬁcial spreading melanoma is the 
most frequent. 
  (2) Lentigo maligna melanoma is similar to 
the superﬁcial spreading type. It it preceded 
by the in situ form called lentigo maligna (an 
irregular freckle that progresses slowly) and, 
when it becomes invasive, it is called lentigo 
maligna melanoma.
  (3) Acral lentiginous melanoma also spreads 
superﬁcially before becoming invasive. It is  
the least common melanoma among Cauca-
sians but most common in African-Americans 
and Asians.
(4) Nodular melanoma is commonly invasive 
at the time it is ﬁrst diagnosed. This type of 

melanoma displays vertical growth, in contrast 
to the three previous types that show radial 
growth (superﬁcial spreading) before invasive 
or vertical growth takes place.  

• Epithelial antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) 
are produced by keratinocytes and sweat and 
sebaceous glands to kill or inactivate microor-
ganisms. 
AMPs are released quickly in response to a 
disruption of the skin barrier and provide a 
transient protection against infection. 
  AMPs include:
 (1) (cid:96)-Defensins.
 (2) Cathelicidins. 
  Defensins and cathelicidins carry out a non-
enzymatic disruption of the integrity of cell wall 
or cell membrane structures to promote lysis 
of microorganisms. Atopic dermatitis, rosacea 
and psoriasis have been associated in part to 
the deﬁcient production of AMPs.

• The dermis consists of two layers: 
  (1) The papillary layer (loose connective 
tissue with collagen bundles and thin elastic 
ﬁbers).
  (2) The reticular layer (dense connective 
tissue with collagen bundles and thick elastic 
ﬁbers).  
   Three interconnected blood vessel plexuses 
are in the dermis: 
  (1) The subpapillary plexus (along the papil-
lary layer).
  (2) The cutaneous plexus (at the papillary-
reticular layer interface).
  (3) The hypodermic or subcutaneous plexus 
(in the hypodermis). 
  The primary function of the vascular network 
is thermoregulation; the secondary function is 
nutrition of the skin and appendages.

• Vascular abnormalities of the skin are com-
mon.  There are:
  (1) Vascular malformations: vascular hamar-
tomas and hemangiomas.
  (2) Vascular dilatations: telangiectases.
  (3) Tumors: angiomas, Kaposi’s sarcoma, 
and angiosarcomas.
  Vasculitis includes a group of disorders in 
which there is inﬂammation of and damage to 
blood vessel walls. Most cases of cutaneous 
vasculitis affect small vessels, predominantly 
venules.
  Noninﬂammatory purpuras, caused by ex-
travasation of blood in the dermis from small 
vessels, can be small (petechiae; less than 
3 mm in diameter), or large (ecchymoses). 
Coagulation disorders, red blood cell diseases 
(sickle cell disease), and trauma are common 
causes. 
  Acute urticaria is a transient reaction caused  
by increased vascular permeability associated 
with edema in the dermis.

• Sensory receptors are specialized neurons 
and epithelial-like cells that receive and con-
vert a physical stimulus into an electrical signal 
transmitted to the central nervous system. 
  Sensory receptors in general can be classiﬁed 
as:

 (1) Exteroceptors: provide information about 
the external environment.
 (2) Proprioceptors: provide information about 
the position and movements of the body.
  (3) Interoceptors: provide information from 
the internal organs of the body.
   Based on the type of stimulus, sensory 
receptors of the skin can be classiﬁed as:
  (1) Mechanoreceptors: respond to mechani-
cal stimulation. There are four primary tactile 
mechanoreceptors in human skin: 
(cid:3)(cid:3)Merkel disk: found in the stratum basale of 
the epidermis of the ﬁngertips and lips. The 
nerve ending of the Merkel disk mechano-
receptor discriminates ﬁne touch and forms 
a ﬂattened discoid structure attached to the 
Merkel cell.   
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Meissner corpuscle: found in the upper 
dermis, bulging into the epidermis of the 
ﬁngertips and eyelids. This receptor detects 
shape and texture during active touch.
(cid:3)(cid:3)Rufﬁni ending: located in the deep dermis. It 
detects skin stretch and deformations within 
joints. 
(cid:3)Pacinian corpuscle: found in the deep dermis 
and hypodermis. It responds to transient pres-
sure and high-frequency vibration. They are 
found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, 
pancreas, breast, and genitals. 
  Meissner corpuscle, Rufﬁni ending, pacinian 
corpuscle, and Krause end bulb are encapsu-
ated receptors. Krause end bulb is a thermo-
receptor found in the conjunctiva of the eye, 
in the mucosa of the lips and tongue, and in 
the epineurium of nerves.  
  (2) Thermoreceptors: respond to tempera-
ture changes. Krause end bulb detects cold. 
Krause end-bulbs are found in the conjunctiva 
of the eye, in the mucosa of the lips and 
tongue, and in the epineurium of nerves. 
  (3) Nociceptors: respond to pain. The 
simplest form of pain detectors are the free 
nerve endings. They derive from the dermal 
nerve plexus, supplied by cutaneous branches 
of the spinal nerves. 
  The perception of pain is associated to acute 
inﬂammation, one of the classical responses 
to tissue injury. Injured cells release chemical 
mediators, including substance P,  acting on 
local blood vessels and nerve endings. Sub-
stance P triggers the degranulation of mast 
cells, histamine in particular, that enhances 
vascular dilation and plasma leakage.
  Hyperemia accounts for the triple response 
of Lewis when a line is made on the skin 
with a pointed object: ﬂush (capillary dilation), 
ﬂare (redness spreading because of arteriolar 
dilation), and wheal (localized edema). The 
triple response develops between 1 to 3 
minutes.
  Peritrichial nerve endings are wrapped 
around the hair follicle just under the seba-
ceous glands. They are stimulated when the 
hairs bend.

• Leprosy (lepra) is a chronic infection of the 
skin, nasal mucosa, and peripheral nerves 
caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an intracel-
lular bacillus found in Schwann cells, endothe-
lial cells and macrophages of the skin. Nerve

lesions result in anesthesia in the extremities, 
claw hand, and foot drop.
  There are two histologic types of leprosy:
  (1) The lepromatous reaction, characterized 
by numerous macrophages in the dermis with 
intracellular acid-fast bacilli.
  (2) The tuberculoid reaction, identiﬁed 
by non-caseating granulomas consisting of 
macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and 
lymphocytes (T cells). Bacilli are difﬁcult to 
ﬁnd. Granulomas tend to extend  into the 
bundles of the cutaneous nerve, destroy the 
sweat glands, and erode the superﬁcial dermis.

• Skin appendages
  Hair (or pilosebaceous unit). The ﬁrst type of 
hair of the human embryo is called lanugo and 
is thin and unpigmented. 
  Lanugo is replaced by vellus before birth. 
  Terminal hair replaces vellus, which remains 
in the hairless regions of the skin (for example, 
the forehead).
  Hair follicles are constantly cycling between:
  (1) Growth  (anagen) phase.
  (2) Regression (catagen) phase.
  (3) Resting (telogen) phase. 
  Hair follicles are tubular invaginations of the 
epidermis. Each hair follicle consists of two 
components: 
  (1) The hair shaft, which includes the me-
dulla, cortex, and cuticule, the latter associated 
with the internal root sheath.
  (2) The hair bulb, the expanded portion of 
the hair follicle. 
  The hair follicle is surrounded by connec-
tive tissue (associated with the external root 
sheath, a downgrowth of the epidermis). 
  The dermal papilla extends into the hair bulb. 
  Hair is generated from the base of the hair 
bulb. 
   The hair bulb has two layers: the matrix 
zone, where all mitotic activity occurs, and the 

keratogenous zone, where hair cells undergo 
keratinization.   
  Two structures are associated with the hair 
follicle:
  (1) The arrector pili muscle, spanning from  
the external root sheath of the hair follicle to 
the epidermis.
  (2) The sebaceous glands, with their excre-
tory ducts connected to the lumen of the hair 
follicle.

• Development of the skin  
There are two signaling pathways that 
stimulate stem cells to enter the epidermal 
differentiation pathway: 
  (1) The Wnt (wingless-related) signaling 
pathway.
  (2) The Notch signaling pathway. 
  The Wnt signaling pathway is important for 
the morphogenesis of the hair follicle. 
  The Notch signaling pathway stimulates 
epidermal differentiation in the postnatal 
epidermis.

• Glands of the skin include:
  (1) Sebaceous glands.
  (2) Sweat glands (eccrine and apocrine; 
both are merocrine).
  (3) Mammary glands (see Chapter 23).
   Sebaceous glands are holocrine simple sac-
cular glands. The secretory portion is located 
in the dermis; the excretory duct opens into 
the hair follicle. Cells of the secretory portion 
(alveoli) contain small lipid droplets (sebum).
  Eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands are simple 
coiled tubular glands. Their primary function 
is control of body temperature. The secretory 
portion consists of three cell types: 
  (1) Basal clear cells, separated from each 
other by intercellular canaliculi; they secrete 
water and electrolytes.
  (2) Apical dark cells, that secrete glycopro-
teins, including AMPs human (cid:96)-defensins 

(BD1 and BD2), cathelicidin, and dermicidin.
  (3) Myoepithelial cells, whose contractile 
activity assists in the release of secretion into 
the glandular lumen.  
  The excretory portion is lined by a stratiﬁed 
cuboidal epithelium (except in the epidermis, 
where keratinocytes of the interpapillary peg 
constitute the wall of the excretory duct). 

• Cystic ﬁbrosis is a genetic disorder of 
epithelial transport of chloride ions by the 
channel protein cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR). The lining epi-
thelium of the excretory duct of eccrine sweat 
glands contains CFTR. 
  A defect in CFTR causes a decrease in the 
reabsorption of sodium chloride from the lu-
men, resulting in increased concentrations of 
Cl- in sweat (salty skin).
  Apocrine sweat glands are coiled and occur 
in the axilla, mons pubis, and circumanal area. 
The secretory acini are larger than in eccrine 
sweat  glands. The excretory duct opens into 
the hair follicle, instead of into the epidermis 
as in the eccrine sweat glands. Ceruminous 
glands in the external auditory meatus and 
glands of Moll of the margins of the eyelids, 
are examples of apocrine sweat glands.

• Fingernails. The nails are hard keratin plates 
covering the nail bed, the surface of the skin 
consisting of the stratum basale and stratum 
spinosum only. 
  Nail plates are formed by scales of corniﬁed 
epithelial cells. The proximal edge of the plate 
is the root or matrix of the nail, where the 
whitish crescent-shaped lunula is located.
  The stratum corneum of the epidermis 
forms the hyponychium, a thick structure, un-
der the distal and free edge of the nail plate. 
  The proximal edge of the plate is covered by 
the eponychium, a projection of the stratum 
corneum of the skin.

12. Cardiovascular System

The cardiovascular system is a continuous, completely closed network of endothelial tubes. The general purpose 
of the cardiovascular system is the perfusion of capillary beds permeating all organs with fresh blood over a 
narrow range of hydrostatic pressures. Local functional demands determine the structural nature of the wall 
surrounding the endothelial tubes. The heart is the main driver of the circulatory system. It functions as a pump. 
The architecture of the urinary and respiratory systems is based on the organization of the vasculature. Pathologic  
conditions of the cardiovascular system have a major impact on the normal function of the kidneys and lungs. In 
this chapter, the structural features of the heart, blood and lymphatic vessels are described and integrated with 
key pathologic conditions, including edema, vasculitis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, embolism, and  infarction. 

General characteristics of blood circulation
The circulation is divided into the systemic or pe-
ripheral circulation and the pulmonary circulation.
Arteries transport blood under high pressure and 
their muscular walls are thick (Figure 12-1). The veins 
are conduits for  transport of blood from tissues back 
to the heart. The pressure in the venous system is very 
low and the walls of the veins are thin.   

There are variations in blood pressure in various 
parts of the cardiovascular system  (see Figure 12-1). 
Because  the  heart  pumps  blood  continuously  in  a 
pulsatile fashion into the aorta, the pressure in the 
aorta is high (about 100 mm Hg) and the arterial 
pressure  ﬂuctuates  between  a  systolic  level  of  120 
mm Hg and a diastolic level of 80 mm Hg. 

As the blood ﬂows through the systemic circula-
tion,  its  pressure  reaches  the  lowest  value  when  it 
returns to the right atrium of the heart through the

terminal vena cava. In the capillaries, the pressure is 
about 35 mm Hg at the arteriolar end and lower (10 
mm Hg) at the venous end. Although the pressure 
in the pulmonary  arteries is pulsatile, as in the aorta, 
the systolic pressure is less (about 25 mm Hg), and 
the diastolic pressure is 8 mm Hg. The pressure in the 
pulmonary capillaries is only 7 mm Hg, as compared 
with an average pressure of 17 mm Hg in the capillary 
bed of the systemic circulation.

Heart
The heart is a folded endothelial tube whose wall is 
thickened to act as a regulated pump. The heart is 
the major determinant of systemic blood pressure.

The cardiac wall consists of three layers:
1. Endocardium, consisting of an endothelial lin-

ing and subendothelial connective tissue.

2. Myocardium, a functional syncytium of striated 
cardiac muscle ﬁbers forming three major types of 
cardiac muscle: atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and 
specialized excitatory and conductive muscle ﬁbers.
3. Pericardium. The epicardium, the visceral layer 
of the pericardium, is a low-friction surface lined by a
mesothelium in contact with the parietal pericardial 
space. 

The heart is composed of two syncytia of muscle 

ﬁbers: 

1. The atrial syncytium, forming the walls of the 

two atria.

2. The ventricular syncytium, forming the wall of 
the two ventricles. Atria and ventricles are separated 
by ﬁbrous connective tissue surrounding the valvular 
openings between the atria and the ventricles.

Conductive system of the heart
The heart has two specialized conductive systems: 

1. The sinus node, or sinoatrial (S-A) node, which 
generates impulses to cause rhythmic contractions of 
the cardiac muscle. 

2. A specialized conductive system, consisting of 
the internodal pathway, which conducts the impulse 

383383

Figure 12-2. Heart: Purkinje ﬁbers

Purkinje fibers are bundles of impulse-conducting 
cardiac fibers extending from the atrioventricular 
node. They can be found beneath the endocardium 
lining the interventricular septum. 
   Purkinje fibers can be distinguished from regular 
cardiocytes by their location, their larger size, and 
lighter cytoplasmic staining (glycogen content). 

The subendocardial connective tissue layer consists of 
collagen and elastic fibers synthesized by fibroblasts. 
    This layer contains small blood vessels, nerves, and 
bundles of the conduction system (Purkinje fibers).  The 
subendocardial layer is not present in papillary muscles 
and chordae tendineae inserted at the free edges of the 
mitral and tricuspid valves.

The myocardium consists of three cell types:
1. Contractile cardiocytes, which contract to pump 

blood through the circulation.

2. Myoendocrine cardiocytes, producing atrial 

natriuretic factor.

3. Nodal cardiocytes, specialized to control the 

rhythmic contraction of the heart. These cells are 
located in (1) the sinoatrial node, at the superior 
vena cava–right atrium junction; and (2) the 
atrioventricular node, present under the 
endocardium of the interatrial and interventricular 
septa.

Myocardium (cardiac muscle)

from  the  S-A  node  to  the  atrioventricular  (A-V) 
node); the A-V node, in which the atrial impulse is 
delayed before reaching the ventricles; the atrioven-
tricular bundle, which conducts the impulse from the 
atria to the ventricles; and the left and right bundles 
of Purkinje ﬁbers, which conduct the impulse to all 
parts of the ventricles (Figure 12-2).

When stretched, cardiac muscle cells of the atrium, 
the atrial cardiocytes, secrete a hormone called atrial 
natriuretic peptide (ANP) (Figure 12-3) that stimu-
lates both diuresis and excretion of sodium in urine 
(natriuresis) by increasing the glomerular ﬁltration 
rate. By this mechanism, the blood volume is reduced.  
Histologically  (see  Figure  7-18  in  Chapter  7, 
Muscle Tissue), individual cardiac muscle cells have 
a  central  nucleus  and  are  linked  to  each  other  by 
intercalated  disks. The  presence  of  gap  junctions 
in the longitudinal segment of the intercalated disks 
between connected cardiac muscle cells allows free 
diffusion of ions and the rapid spread of the action 
potential  from cell to cell. The electrical resistance 
is low because gap junctions bypass the transverse 

components of the intercalated disk (fasciae adher-
entes and desmosomes).

Purkinje ﬁbers
The Purkinje ﬁbers lie beneath the endocardium lin-
ing the two sides of the interventricular septum (see 
Figure 12-2). They can be distinguished from cardiac 
muscle ﬁbers because they contain a reduced number 
of myoﬁbrils located at the periphery of the ﬁber and 
the diameter of the ﬁber is larger. In addition, they 
give a positive reaction for acetylcholinesterase, and 
they contain abundant glycogen. 

Purkinje  ﬁbers  lose  these  speciﬁc  characteristics 
when  they  merge  with  cardiac  muscle  ﬁbers.  Like 
cardiac muscle ﬁbers, Purkinje ﬁbers are striated and 
are linked to each other by atypical intercalated disks.

Arteries
Arteries conduct blood from the heart to the capil-
laries. They store some of the pumped blood during 
each cardiac systole to ensure continued ﬂow through 
the capillaries during cardiac diastole.

Atrial cell granules 

Atrial cardiocytes store membrane-bound granules whose density can be 
altered by varying the intake of salt and water.  
    Atrial cell granules contain the precursor of atrial natriuretic peptide 
(ANP), a potent polypeptide hormone that stimulates diuresis (Greek  
diourein, to urinate) and natriuresis (Latin natrium, sodium + Greek 
diourein). Once outside the atrial cell, the ANP precursor undergoes a 
rapid enzymatic cleavage to produce circulating ANP.
    ANP binding to natriuretic peptide receptors NPR1, NPR2, and 
NPR3 (with guanylyl cyclase activity), causes the conversion of 
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
(cGMP). Then, cGMP activates a cGMP-dependent kinase that 
phosphorylates specific serine and threonine residues in target proteins. 
    ANP antagonizes the actions of vasopressin, a polypeptide released 
from the neurohypophysis, and angiotensin II (ANG II). ANG II is a 
peptide derived from the renin-induced breakdown of angiotensinogen 
(AGT), produced in liver and released into the systemic blood.  
    ANP prevents sodium and water reabsorption from causing 
hypervolemia (abnormal increase in the volume of circulating fluid in the 
body) and hypertension that can result in cardiac failure.

Atrial cell granules 

Arteries  are  organized  in  three  major  tunics  or 

layers (Figure 12-4):

1.  The  tunica  intima  is  the  innermost  coat.  It 
consists  of  an  endothelial  lining  continuous  with 
the endocardium, the inner lining of the heart; an 
intermediate  layer  of  loose  connective  tissue,  the 
subendothelium;  and  an  external  layer  of  elastic 
ﬁbers, the internal elastic lamina.

2. The tunica media is the middle coat. It consists 
mainly of smooth muscle cells surrounded by a vari-
able number of collagen ﬁbers, extracellular matrix, 
and elastic sheaths with irregular gaps (fenestrated 
elastic membranes). 

Collagen ﬁbers provide a supporting framework 
for smooth muscle cells and limit the distensibility 
of the wall of the vessel. Veins have a higher content 
of collagen than arteries.

3. The tunica externa, or adventitia, is the outer 
coat  and  consists  mainly  of  connective  tissue.  An 
external  elastic  lamina  can  be  seen  separating  the 
tunica media from the adventitia. 

The adventitia of large vessels (arteries and veins) 
contains small vessels (vasa vasorum) that penetrate 
the outer portion of the tunica media to supply oxy-
gen and nutrients.

From the heart to the capillaries, arteries can be 

classiﬁed into three major groups: 

1. Large-sized elastic arteries.
2.  Medium-sized  muscular  arteries  (see  Figure

3. Small-sized arteries and arterioles.

Large elastic arteries are conducting vessels
The aorta and its largest branches (the brachiocephal-

ic, common carotid, subclavian, and common iliac
arteries) are elastic arteries (Figure 12-5). They are 
conducting arteries because they conduct blood from 
the heart to the medium-sized distributing arteries.
Large elastic arteries have two major characteristics:
1. They receive blood from the heart under high 

pressure.

2. They keep blood circulating continuously while 

the heart is pumping intermittently. 

Because they distend during systole and recoil dur-
ing diastole, elastic arteries can sustain a continuous 
blood ﬂow despite the intermittent pumping action 
of the heart. 

The tunica intima of the elastic arteries consists 
of  the endothelium and the subendothelial connec-
tive tissue.

Large amounts of fenestrated elastic sheaths are 
found in the tunica media, with bundles of smooth 
muscle  cells  permeating  the  narrow  gaps  between 
the  elastic  lamellae.  Collagen  ﬁbers  are  present  in 
all tunics, but especially in the adventitia. We have 
seen in Chapter 4, Connective Tissue, that smooth 
muscle cells can synthesize both elastic and collagen 
ﬁbers.  Blood  vessels  (vasa  vasorum),  nerves  (nervi 
vasorum), and lymphatics can be recognized in the 
tunica adventitia of large elastic arteries.

Pathology: Aortic aneurysms 
Aneurysms are dilatations of arteries; the dilatations 
of veins are called varices.

The two major types of aortic aneurysms are the 
syphilitic aneurysm (relatively rare because syphilis 
is no longer common) and the abdominal aneurysm.
Syphilitic  aneurysms  are  mostly  localized  in  the

Functional characteristics of muscular arteries

Arteries conduct blood from the heart to the capillaries 
and also store a portion of the ejected blood  during each 
cardiac systole to enable the flow to proceed through the 
capillaries during cardiac diastole.

   When  blood pressure is determined in an individual by 
a sphygmomanometer, systolic pressure is recorded by 
a stethoscope as a tapping sound originating in the 
artery distal to the cuff.  When the cuff pressure 
decreases below the peak arterial pressure (below 120 
mm Hg), spurts of blood pass through the externally 
compressed artery. Diastolic pressure is recorded 
when the tapping sound disappears as the cuff pressure 
falls below minimal arterial pressure (below 80 mm Hg). 
The blood flow then becomes continuous.

ascending aorta and its arch.  Abdominal aneurysms 
are caused by a weakening of the aortic wall produced 
by atherosclerosis. 

Aortic  aneurysms  generate  murmurs  caused  by 
blood  turbulence  in  the  dilated  aortic  segment.  A  
severe complication of an aneurysm is aortic dissec-
tion caused by a tear in the tunica intima that enables 
blood to penetrate and form an intramural hematoma 
between the intima and the tunica media or the media 

and the tunica adventitia. Aortic dissection is associ-
ated with high mortality caused by exsanguination. 
Marfan  syndrome  (see  Chapter  4,  Connective 
Tissue) is an autosomal dominant defect associated 
with  aortic  dissecting  aneurysm  and  skeletal  and 
ocular abnormalities due to mutations in the ﬁbrillin 
1 gene. Fibrillins are major components of the elastic 
ﬁbers found in the aorta, periosteum, and suspensory 
ligament of the lens.

Medium-sized muscular arteries are distributing 
vessels
There is a gradual transition from large arteries, to 
medium-sized arteries, to small arteries and arteri-
oles. Medium-sized arteries are distributing vessels, 
allowing a selective distribution of blood to different 
organs in response to functional  needs. Examples  
of  medium-sized  arteries  include  the  radial,  tibial, 
popliteal, axillary, splenic, mesenteric, and intercostal 
arteries. The  diameter  of  medium-sized  muscular 
arteries is about 3 mm or greater.

The tunica intima consists of three layers: 
1. The endothelium.
2. The subendothelium.
3. The internal elastic lamina (see Figure 12-4).  
The internal elastic lamina is a fenestrated band of 
elastic ﬁbers that often shows folds in sections of ﬁxed 
tissue because of contraction of the smooth muscle 
cell layer (tunica media).  

The tunica media shows a signiﬁcant reduction in 
elastic components and an increase in smooth muscle 
ﬁbers. In the larger vessels of this group, a fenestrated 
external elastic lamina  can be seen at the junction 
of the tunica media and the adventitia.

Arterioles are resistance vessels
Arterioles are the ﬁnal branches of the arterial sys-
tem.  Arterioles  regulate  the  distribution  of  blood 
to different capillary beds by vasoconstriction and 
vasodilation in localized regions. Partial contraction 
(known as tone) of the vascular smooth muscle exists 
in arterioles. Arterioles are structurally adapted for 
vasoconstriction and vasodilation because their walls 

contain  circularly  arranged  smooth  muscle  ﬁbers. 
Arterioles are regarded as resistance vessels and are 
the major determinants of systemic blood pressure 
(Figure 12-6). 

The diameter of arterioles and small arteries ranges 
from 20 to 130 (cid:43)m. Because the lumen is small,  these 
blood vessels can be closed down to generate high 
resistance to blood ﬂow. 

The tunica  intima has an endothelium, suben-
dothelium, and internal elastic lamina. The tunica 
media  consists  of  two  to  ﬁve  concentric  layers  of 
smooth muscle cells. The tunica adventitia, or tunica 
externa, contains slight  collagenous tissue, binding 
the vessel to its surroundings.

The  segment  beyond  the  arteriole  proper  is  the 
metarteriole,  the  terminal  branch  of  the  arterial 
system. It consists of one layer of muscle cells, often 
discontinuous,  and  represents  an  important  local 
regulator of blood ﬂow. 

Capillaries are exchange vessels
Capillaries  are  extremely  thin  tubes  formed  by  a 
single  layer  of  highly  permeable  endothelial  cells
surrounded by a basal lamina. The diameter range 
of a capillary is  about 5 to 10 (cid:43)m, large enough to 
accommodate one red blood cell, and thin enough 
(0.5 (cid:43)m) for gas diffusion.
    The microvascular bed, the site of the microcir-
culation (Figure 12-7), is composed of the terminal 
arteriole (and metarteriole), the capillary bed, and 
the postcapillary venules. The capillary bed consists 
of slightly large capillaries (called preferential or thor-
oughfare channels), where blood ﬂow is continuous,

Figure 12-6. Arterioles: Resistance vessels

  Vascular smooth muscle cells of arterioles  

Vascular smooth muscle cells have a significant role in 
the control of total peripheral resistance, arterial and 
venous tone, and blood distribution throughout the 
body.
   The cytoplasm of vascular smooth muscle cells 
contains actin and myosin filaments whose contraction   
is controlled by calcium.  The increase in calcium 
concentration occurs through voltage-gated calcium 
channels (known as electromechanical coupling) 
and through receptor-mediated calcium channels 
(known as pharmacomechanical coupling). Both 
channels are present in the  plasma membrane.  
Calcium can also be released from cytoplasmic 
storage sites (endoplasmic reticulum). Smooth muscle 
cells lack troponin.
   The constant blood flow depends on a myogenic 
mechanism: arteriolar smooth muscle cells contract in 
response to increased transmural pressure and relax 
when the pressure decreases.

and small capillaries, called the true capillaries, where 
blood ﬂow is intermittent. 

The amount of blood entering the microvascular 
bed is regulated by the contraction of  smooth muscle 
ﬁbers of the precapillary sphincters located where 
true capillaries arise from the arteriole or metarteriole. 
The capillary circulation can be bypassed by channels 
(through channels) connecting terminal arterioles to 
postcapillary venules. 

When functional demands decrease, most precapil-
lary sphincters are closed, forcing the ﬂow of blood 
into thoroughfare channels. Arteriovenous shunts, 
or  anastomoses,  are  direct  connections  between 
arterioles and postcapillary venules and bypass the 
microvascular bed.

The three-dimensional design of the microvascu-
lature varies from organ to organ. The local condi-
tions of the tissues (concentration of nutrients and 
metabolites and other substances) can control local 
blood ﬂow in small portions of a tissue area. 

Types of capillaries
Three morphologic types of capillaries are recognized 
(Figures 12-8 and 12-9): 

1. Continuous.
2. Fenestrated.
3. Discontinuous (sinusoids).
Continuous  capillaries  are  lined  by  a  complete 
simple squamous endothelium and a basal lamina. 
Pericytes  can  occur  between  the  endothelium  and 
the basal lamina. Pericytes are undifferentiated cells 
that resemble modiﬁed smooth muscle cells and are 
distributed at random intervals in close contact with 
the basal lamina. Endothelial cells are linked by tight 
junctions and transport ﬂuids and solutes by caveolae
and pinocytotic vesicles. Continuous capillaries occur 
in the brain, muscle, skin, thymus, and lungs.

Fenestrated capillaries have pores, or fenestrae, 
with or without diaphragms. Fenestrated capillaries 
with a diaphragm are found in intestines, endocrine 
glands,  and  around  kidney  tubules.  Fenestrated 
capillaries  without  a  diaphragm  are  characteristic 
of the renal glomerulus. In this particular case, the 
basal lamina constitutes an important permeability 
barrier, as we will analyze in detail in Chapter 14, 
Urinary System. 

Discontinuous  capillaries  are  characterized  by 
an incomplete endothelial lining and basal lamina,

Arterioles have an endothelial lining, a thick smooth muscle layer, and a 
thin adventitial layer. Arterioles can give rise to capillaries or, in some 
tissues, to metarterioles, which then give rise to capillaries. Arterioles 
regulate blood flow through capillaries by constriction or dilation of the 
precapillary sphincters. However, most tissues lack metarterioles or 
precapillary sphincters.
   Capillaries are numerous in metabolically active tissues (such as 
cardiac and skeletal muscle and glands). The diameter of the capillaries 
is variable (it can be less than the diameter of a red blood cell that is 
transiently deformed when passing through these capillaries).
   The capillary bed  provides for exchange of gases and solutes 
between blood and tissue (known as nutritional flow). Blood bypassing 
the capillaries, by a metarteriole or an arteriovenous shunt, is known as 
non-nutritional or shunt flow.

Veins are capacitance, or reservoir, vessels
The venous system starts at the end of the capillary 
bed  with  a  postcapillary  venule  that  structurally 

resembles  continuous  capillaries  but  with  a  wider 
lumen. 

Postcapillary venules, the preferred site of migra-
tion of blood cells into tissues by a mechanism called 
diapedesis (Greek dia, through; pedan, to leap), are 
tubes of endothelial cells supported by a basal lamina 
and an adventitia of collagen ﬁbers and ﬁbroblasts. 
In lymphatic tissues, the endothelial cells are taller. 
High  endothelial  venules  are  associated  with  the

Endothelial cells have a complete (continuous) cytoplasm. This type is found in 
muscle, brain, thymus, bone, lung, and other tissues.
    Caveolae and vesicles transport substances through the cytoplasm in a 
bidirectional pathway (transcytosis). The intracytoplasmic vesicles are coated by 
the protein caveolin. 
    The basal lamina is continuous. In the lung, the thin endothelial cell cytoplasm 
allows diffusion of gases from the alveolus into the blood (CO2) and from the blood 
into the alveolus (O2).

Fenestrated capillary

The endothelial cell has many fenestrae (10 to 100 nm in diameter) with or 
without a thin diaphragm.  The basal lamina is continuous.
    This type is present  in tissues with substantial fluid transport (intestinal villi, 
choroid plexus, ciliary processes of the eyes).
    A fenestrated endothelial cell is present in the glomerular capillaries of the 
kidneys supported by a significantly thicker basal lamina.

Discontinuous capillary (sinusoid)

The gaps in discontinuous capillaries are larger than in fenestrated capillaries. 
The basal lamina is discontinuous. 
The gaps in venous sinusoids of the liver are wider than the discontinuous 
capillaries. The basal lamina is fragmented and often absent. 
    In the spleen, the endothelial cells are elongated and protrude into the lumen. 
The basal lamina is incomplete and surrounded by reticular fibers. Blood cells 
can pass readily through the walls of the splenic sinuses (see Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System).

mechanism of homing of lymphocytes in lymphoid 
organs (see Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System).
Postcapillary venules converge to form muscular 
venules, which converge into collecting venules, lead-
ing to a series of veins of progressively larger diameter.
Veins have a relatively thin wall in comparison with 
arteries  of  the  same  size  (Figure  12-10). The  high 
capacitance of veins is attributable to the distensibil-
ity of their wall (compliance vessels) and, therefore, 
the content of blood is large relative to the volume 
of  the  veins.  A  small  increase  in  the  intraluminal 
pressure results in a  large increase in the volume of 
contained blood.

Similar to arteries, veins consist of tunics. How-
ever, the distinction of a tunica media from a tunica 
adventitia is often not clear. The lumen is lined by an 
endothelium and a subjacent basal lamina. A distinct 
internal elastic lamina is not seen. 

The  muscular  tunica  media  is  thinner  than  in 
arteries, and smooth muscle cells have an irregular 
orientation,  approximately  circular.  A  longitudinal 

orientation is observed in the iliac vein, brachioce-
phalic vein, superior and inferior venae cavae, portal 
vein, and renal vein. 

The tunica adventitia consists of collagen ﬁbers 
and ﬁbroblasts with few nerve ﬁbers. In large veins, 
the vasa vasorum penetrate the wall. 
   A typical characteristic of veins is the presence of 
valves to prevent reﬂux of blood. A valve is a projec-
tion  into  the  lumen  of  the  tunica  intima,  covered 
by endothelial cells and strengthened by elastic and 
collagen ﬁbers. 

Examples of varices (dilatations of veins) are hem-
orrhoids (varices of the internal or external plexus of 
the rectum),  varicocele (varices of the pampiniform 
plexus of the spermatic cord), varicose veins of the 
legs and varices of the esophagus (associated with 
portal hypertension and cirrhosis of the liver).

Functional characteristics of veins

Clinical significance: Varicose veins

Veins are high-capacitance vessels containing about 70% of the 
total blood volume.
    In contrast to arteries, the tunica media contains fewer smooth 
muscle cell bundles associated with reticular and elastic fibers.
    Although veins of the extremities have intrinsic vasomotor activity, 
the transport of blood back to the heart depends on external forces 
provided by the contraction of surrounding skeletal muscles and on 
valves that ensure one-way blood flow. 

Varicose veins result from intrinsic weakness of the muscular tunica 
media caused by increased intraluminal pressure or from defects in 
the structure and function of the valves that hamper the flow of 
venous blood toward the heart.
    Although varicose veins can be seen in any vein in the body, the 
most common are the saphenous veins of the legs, veins in the 
anorectal region (hemorrhoids), the veins of the lower esophagus 
(esophageal varices), and veins in the spermatic cord 
(varicocele).

nologic pathogens. Bacterial and rickettsial infection, 
syphilis and fungi cause vasculitis, thrombophlebitis 
(thrombosis and inﬂammation of the wall of a vein) 
and pseudoaneurysms (dilation of the wall of a blood 
vessel by the lytic activity of bacterial enzymes.

Most inﬂammatory conditions of the wall of arter-

ies involve an immune-based pathogenesis. 

Antigen-antibody complexes, accumulating in the 
wall of a blood vessel, can activate the complement 
cascade, as you have learned in Chapter 10, Immune-
Lymphatic System. When neutrophils are attracted 
by chemotactic fragments released by the activated 
complement cascade and exposed to cytokines, they 
release  serine  proteinase  3  and  myeloperoxidase, 
capable of causing damage to the vascular wall.

Antibodies reacting with cytoplasmic components 
of  neutrophils  (anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic  anti-
body,  ANCA)  release  enzymes  from  the  activated 
neutrophils, causing vascular wall injury. 

Serine proteinase 3, a component of cytoplasmic 
granules  in  neutrophils,  is  the  antigen  that  gener-

ates C-ANCA (cytoplasmic ANCA); P-ANCA are 
antibodies to myeloperoxidase showing a perinuclear 
pattern in neutrophils (perinuclear ANCA) by im-
munocytochemistry.

1. Giant cell arteritis is a common form of vasculi-
tis in adults (over the age of 50) that affects temporal, 
ophthalmic or vertebral arteries. Headache, pain in 
the shoulders, hips and jaw claudication as well as an 
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are common 
ﬁndings.  Blindness  from  giant  cell  arteritis  of  the 
ophthalmic artery is irreversible if the disease is not 
treated early with prednisone. A biopsy of the tempo-
ral artery, showing in most cases giant multinucleated 
cells (macrophages) and lymphocyte inﬁltrates in the

3. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN; see Figure 12-11) 
affects the wall of medium- to small-sized arteries of 
the  skin,  kidneys,  liver,  heart,  and  gastrointestinal

B and/or hepatitis C. The disease is more common

the effective treatment of PAN.

women under the age of 40 and affects the aorta and

followed by an occlusive phase, the narrowing and 
segmental dilation of the aorta and/or its branches, 
resulting  in  absent  pulses. Takayasu’s  arteritis  and

show destruction of the blood vessel wall and giant

 Box 12-A  | How lymph ﬂows

•  By intrinsic contraction
When collecting lymphatics or larger lymphatic vessels become expanded by 
lymph, the smooth muscle of the wall contracts. Each segment of the lymphatic 
vessel between successive valves, called lymphangions, behaves like an auto-
matic pump: When the segment is ﬁlled with lymph, the wall contracts, the valve 
opens, and lymph ﬂows into the next segment. This process continues along the 
entire length of the lymph vessel until the ﬂuid is ﬁnally emptied.
•  By extrinsic contraction
In addition to the intrinsic contraction mechanism, external factors such as 
contraction of the surrounding muscles during exercise, arterial pulsations, and 
compression of tissues by forces outside the body compress the lymph vessel 
and cause pumping. When lymph drainage is impaired, excess ﬂuid accumu-
lates in the tissue spaces (edema).

vascular eosinophils. The cause of CSS is unknown.
7. Wegener’s granulomatosis  is a necrotizing ar-
teritis of the respiratory tract and kidneys. Although 
C-ANCAs  are  frequently  present  in  patients  with 
Wegener’s granulomatosis, a lung biopsy is the most 
effective way of diagnosing this condition. The wall 
of blood vessels shows vasculitis, granulomas  and 
extensive necrosis.

8.  Henoch-Schönlein  purpura(HSP)is 
the  most  common  form  of  vasculitis  in  children. 
It is associated with purpura (purple-colored spots 
of  the  skin  and  mucosae),  arthritis,  nephritis  and 
abdominal pain. In most cases, HSP follows upper 
respiratory tract infections. A typical ﬁnding in skin 
biopsies is the deposition of  immunoglobulin A in 
the walls of affected blood vessels. HSP frequently 
resolves in a few weeks.

Lymphatic vessels
The functions of the lymphatic vascular system are 
to:

1. Conduct immune cells and lymph to lymph 

nodes.

2. Remove excess ﬂuid accumulated in interstitial 

spaces.

 Box 12-B | Lymphatic vascular disorders

•  Lymphedema is caused by a defect in the transport of lymph because of 
abnormal vessel development or damaged lymphatic vessels. Accumulation of 
ﬂuid and proteins in the interstitial spaces leads to lymphedema. Protein-rich 
ﬂuid in the interstitial space initiates an inﬂammatory reaction causing ﬁbrosis, 
impaired immune responses, and adipose degeneration of the connective 
tissue.
•  Filariasis (elephantiasis) is a parasitic infection of lymphatic vessels by 
Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi worms, transmitted by mosquito bites. 
This condition causes damage to the lymphatic vessels with chronic lymph-
edema of legs and genitals. Filariasis occurs in tropical countries.
•  Chylous ascites and chylothorax are caused by the accumulation of high 
fat containing ﬂuid, or chyle, in the abdomen or thorax as a result of trauma, 
obstruction, or abnormal development of lymphatic vessels.

(blind  tubes)  in  proximity  to  blood  capillaries. 
Lymphatic capillaries collect tissue ﬂuid, the lymph. 
The  wall  of  a  lymphatic  capillary  consists  of  a 
single layer of endothelial cells lacking a complete 
basal lamina (Figure 12-12). Bundles of anchoring 
ﬁlaments associated to the endothelium prevent the 
lymphatic capillaries from collapsing during changes 
in interstitial pressure and enable the uptake of soluble 
tissue components.

Lymphatic capillaries can be found in most tis-
sues. Exceptions are cartilage, bone, epithelia, the 
central nervous system, bone marrow, and placenta.
The accumulation of ﬂuid in the interstitial space 
is a normal event of circulation and blind-ended lym-
phatic capillaries take up the excess ﬂuid. An increase 
in the intraluminal volume in the lymphatic capillary 
opens the overlapping cytoplasmic ﬂaps drawing ﬂuid 
in. When the lymphatic capillary ﬁlls, the overlap-
ping ﬂaps, acting as a primary valve opening, close, 
preventing ﬂuid backﬂow into the interstitium. 

Lymphatic capillaries converge into precollecting 
lymphatic  vessels  draining  lymph  into  collecting 
lymphatic  vessels.  The  collecting  vessels  are  sur-
rounded by smooth muscle cells (see Figure 12-12), 
which  provide  intrinsic  pumping  activity.  Move-
ment  in  the  surrounding  tissue  provides  a  passive 
extrinsic pump. 

The collecting vessels consist of bulblike segments 
separated by luminal valves. The sequential contrac-
tion of each segment, called lymphangions, propels 
the unidirectional ﬂow of lymph (see Box 12-A).

A collecting lymphatic vessel gives rise to termi-
nal lymphatic vessels in the proximity of a lymph 
node. These terminal lymphatic vessels branch and 
become lymphatic afferent vessels, which penetrate 
the lymph node capsule and release lymph and its 
contents into the subcapsular sinus. Lymph nodes are 
distributed along the pathway of the lymph vessels 
to ﬁlter the lymph before reaching the thoracic and 
right lymphatic ducts. A total of 2 to 3 L of lymph 
is produced each day.  

Lymph  is  returned  to  the  bloodstream  via  two 

main trunks:  

1. The large thoracic duct.
2. The smaller right lymphatic duct. 
Larger lymphatic vessels have three layers, similar 
to those of the small veins, but the lumen is larger. 
The tunica intima consists of an endothelium and

The tunica media contains a few smooth muscle 
cells in a concentric arrangement separated by col-
lagenous ﬁbers. 

The  tunica  adventitia  is  connective  tissue  with 

ﬁbroelastic ﬁbers. 

Like veins, lymphatic vessels have valves, but their 

number is larger. The structure of the thoracic duct
is  similar  to  that  of  a  medium-sized  vein,  but  the 
muscular tunica media is more prominent.

In the kidneys, an arteriole is interposed between two capillary networks. An

nephrons.

lymphatics, or lymphatic vessels become blocked. 

Subcutaneous tissue has the capacity to accumulate 
interstitial ﬂuid and give rise to clinical edema (see 
Box 12-B). Subcutaneous edema is caused by an in-
crease in hydrostatic pressure in the systemic venous 
system caused by a failure of the right–heart side.

In patients with extensive capillary injury (burns), 
both intravascular ﬂuid and plasma proteins escape 
into the interstitial space. Proteins accumulating in 
the  interstitial  compartment  increase  the  oncotic 
pressure, leading to additional ﬂuid loss due to the 
greater osmotic force outside the capillary bed.

Edema can occur because of cardiac failure. Pul-
monary edema is the accumulation of ﬂuid in the 
lumen  of  the  pulmonary  alveoli.  A  failure  of  the 
left–heart side increases the hydrostatic pressure in 
the alveolar capillaries leading to the accumulation 
of ﬂuid in the alveolar space.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hemorrhage
The rupture of a blood vessel, determined by trauma  
to a major artery or vein or the rupture of a blood 
vessel because of wall fragility, causes hemorrhage.

Glomerulus and portal systems

Signiﬁcant blood loss can determine hypovolemic 
shock, manifested by a severe drop in blood pressure. 
Blood  is  diverted  from  the  alimentary  system  and 
kidneys to maintain perfusion of the heart and brain.
Hematoma is a localized accumulation of blood 
in  a  tissue,  usually  following  an  injury.  Subdural 
hematoma is an accumulation of blood on the brain 
surface, as the result of head injury or spontaneous 
blood vessel rupture in the elderly.

Petechiae  (less  than  3  mm  in  diameter),  pur-
pura (less than 10 mm in diameter) and ecchymosis 
(greater than 10 mm; a bruise) are small hemorrhages 
of the skin. With aging, the skin becomes less ﬂex-
ible and thinner as fat under the skin is reduced and 
blood vessels break easily when minor injuries occur.

Speciﬁc  capillary  arrangements:  Glomerulus  and 
portal systems
In general, blood from an arteriole ﬂows into a capil-
lary network and is drained by a venule. There are 
two specialized capillary systems that depart from this 
standard arrangement (Figure 12-13): 

1. The glomerulus.
2. The portal systems.
In the kidneys, an afferent arteriole drains into a 
capillary network called the glomerulus. The glomer-
ular capillaries coalesce to form an efferent arteriole, 
which branches into another capillary network called 
the vasa recta. The vasa recta  surround  the limbs of 
the loop of Henle and play a signiﬁcant role in the 
formation of urine. The glomerulus system is essential 
for blood ﬁltration in the renal corpuscle (see Chapter 
14, Urinary System).

In  the  portal  system,  intestinal  capillaries  are 
drained by the portal vein to the liver. In the liver, the 
portal vein branches into venous sinusoids between 
cords of hepatocytes. Blood ﬂows from the sinusoids 
into a collecting vein and then back to the heart via 
the inferior vena cava. 

A similar portal system is observed in the hypophy-
sis. Venules connect the primary sinusoidal plexus of 
the hypothalamus (median eminence) with the sec-
ondary plexus in the anterior lobe of the hypophysis, 
forming the hypophyseal-portal system. This system 
transports releasing factors from the hypothalamus to 
stimulate the secretion of hormones into the blood-
stream by cells of the anterior hypophysis.

Endothelial cell–mediated regulation of blood ﬂow
The general assumption that the endothelium is just 
an  inert  simple  squamous  epithelium  lining  blood 
vessels is no longer correct. In addition to enabling 
the passage of molecules and gases and retaining blood 
cells and large molecules,  endothelial cells  produce 
vasoactive substances  that can induce contraction 
and  relaxation  of  the  smooth  muscle  vascular  wall 
(Figure 12-14). 

Figure 12-14. Endothelium

Endothelial cells control vascular cell growth  

Angiogenesis occurs during normal wound healing and vascularization of 
tumors. Endothelial cells secrete factors that stimulate angiogenesis.
    Some of these factors induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration; 
others activate endothelial cell differentiation or induce a secondary cell type to 
produce angiogenic factors.

        Prostacyclin is formed by endothelial cells

from arachidonic acid by a process catalyzed by 
prostacyclin synthase. Prostacyclin prevents the 
adhesion of platelets to the endothelium, and 
avoids blood clot formation. Prostacyclin is 
also a vasodilator.

Endothelial cells modulate smooth muscle 

activity

         Endothelial cells secrete smooth muscle cell 
2
relaxing factors (such as nitric oxide), and 
smooth muscle cell contraction factors (such as 
endothelin 1).

Endothelial cells trigger blood coagulation

       Endothelial cells release tissue factor that 
3
binds to factor VIIa to convert factor X into factor 
Xa and initiate the common pathway of blood 
clotting (see Blood Coagulation in Chapter 6, 
Blood and Hematopoiesis). 
    Thrombin (bound to its receptor on platelet 
surfaces) acts on fibrinogen to form fibrin 
monomers. Fibrin monomers self-aggregate to 
form a soft fibrin clot cross-linked by factor XIII. 
    Both platelets and fibrin form a hemostatic 
plug when there is an injury to the wall of a 
blood vessel. 

Endothelial cells regulate the traffic of 

inflammatory cells

       Endothelial cells facilitate transendothelial 
4
migration of cells involved in an inflammatory 
reaction (for example, neutrophils) in the 
surrounding extravascular connective tissue. 
    Activated macrophages secrete tumor 
necrosis factor ligand and interleukin-1, 
which induce the expression of E-selectin by 
endothelial cells.

Nitric oxide, synthesized by endothelial cells from 
L-arginine upon stimulation by acetylcholine or other 
agents, activates guanylyl cyclase and consequently 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) produc-
tion, which induces relaxation of the smooth muscle 
cells of the vascular wall. Endothelin 1 is a very potent 
vasoconstrictor peptide produced by endothelial cells.
Prostacyclin,  synthesized  from  arachidonic  acid 
by  the  action  of  cyclooxygenase  and  prostacyclin 
synthase in endothelial cells, determines the relax-
ation of vascular smooth muscle cells by the action of 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Synthetic 
prostacyclin is used to produce vasodilation in severe 

Raynaud’s phenomenon (pain and discoloration of 
the ﬁngers and toes produced by vasospasm), isch-
emia, and in the treatment of pulmonary hyperten-
sion. Prostacyclin also prevents platelet adhesion and 
clumping leading to blood clotting. We discuss later 
in this chapter how endothelial cell dysfunction can 
contribute  to  thrombosis,  a  mass  of  clotted  blood 
formed inside a blood vessel due to the activation of 
the blood coagulation cascade.

The endothelium has a passive role in the trans-
capillary exchange of solvents and solutes by diffu-
sion,  ﬁltration,  and  pinocytosis. The  permeability 
of capillary endothelial cells is tissue-speciﬁc. Liver

       Damage to the endothelium of an artery, caused by

tunica intima after adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 
(VCAM-1). In the intima, monocytes change into macrophages 
expressing scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) that internalizes modified   
cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL-containing multilocular 
deposits give macrophages a foamy appearance.

      The atherosclerotic plaque developed in the intima consists of an

3
      VCAM-1–mediated homing of T cells contributes additional 
inflammatory components to the atherosclerotic plaque. T cell– 
macrophage interaction results in the production of metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) by macrophages and proinflammatory cytokines by T cells.

Atherosclerosis

sinusoids are more permeable to albumin than are the 
capillaries of the renal glomerulus. In addition, there 
is a topographic permeability. The endothelial cells at 
the venous end are more permeable than those at the 
arterial end. Postcapillary venules have the greatest 
permeability to leukocytes. 

Finally, recall the signiﬁcance of endothelial cells 

in the process of cell homing and inﬂammation.

Pathology: Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is the thickening and hardening of 
the walls of arteries caused by atherosclerotic plaques 
of lipids, cells, and connective tissue deposited in the 
tunica intima. Atherosclerosis is frequently seen in 
arteries sustaining high blood pressure, it does not 
affect veins and is the cause of myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and ischemic gangrene. 

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inﬂammatory disease 
driven  by  the  accumulation  of  cholesterol-laden 
macrophages  in  the  artery  wall.  Atherosclerosis  is 
characterized by features of inﬂammation at all stages 
of its development (Figure 12-15). 

The  atherosclerotic  process  is  initiated  when 
cholesterol-containing  low-density  lipoproteins 
(LDLs) accumulate in the intima as a consequence of 
endothelial cell dysfunction. A dysfunctional endo-
thelium expresses vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 
(VCAM-1) that enables monocytes to attach to the 
endothelial cell surface, cross the endothelium and 
penetrate the intima of the blood vessel. 

Monocytes  then  differentiate  into  macrophages 
expressing on their surface scavenger receptor-A (SR- 
A). SR-A uptakes a modiﬁed form of LDL (oxidized 
LDL) and the massive accumulation transforms mac-
rophages into cholesterol-laden foam cells.  Macro-
phage foam cells constitute the atheroma core of the 
atherosclerotic plaque. The atheroma core continues 
to  enlarge  and  smooth  muscle  cells  of  the  tunica 
muscularis migrate to the intima forming a collagen-
containing ﬁbrous cap overlying the atheroma core. 
The endothelium covers the ﬁbrous cap. 

The lipid core enlarges and triggers an inﬂamma-

tory response attracting T cells that stimulate macro-
phage foam cells to produce metalloproteinases that, 
together with proinﬂammatory cytokines produced 
by T cells, weaken the ﬁbrous cap making it suscep-
tible to fracture that predisposes to thrombosis in the 
presence of   procoagulant tissue factor. An enlarging 
thrombus will eventually obstruct or occlude the lu-
men of the affected blood vessel. 

As  you  can  see,  the  clearance  of  lipoproteins  by 
macrophages  appears  initially  beneﬁcial  but,  with 
time, the macrophage function is compromised and 
starts  to  contribute  to  the  inﬂammatory  response 
through the secretion of pro-inﬂammatory mediators 
and extracellular matrix proteases. With time, dying 
macrophages release their lipid contents, which leads 
to the enlargement of the atheroma core.    

The  major    blood  vessels  involved  are  the  ab-
dominal aorta and the coronary and cerebral arter-
ies. Coronary arteriosclerosis causes ischemic heart 
disease  and myocardial infarction occurs when  the 
arterial lesions are complicated by thrombosis.

Atherothrombosis  of  the  cerebral    vessels  is  the 
major cause of brain infarct, so-called stroke, one of 
the most common causes of neurologic disease. Arte-
riosclerosis of the abdominal aorta leads to abdominal 
aortic aneurysm, a dilation that sometimes ruptures 
to produce massive fatal hemorrhage.   

Atherosclerosis  correlates  with  the  serum  levels 
of cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A 
genetic  defect  in  lipoprotein  metabolism  (familial 
hyper-cholesterolemia) is associated with atheroscle-
rosis and myocardial infarction before patients reach 
20 years of age. We discuss in Chapter 2, Epithelial 
Glands, that familial hypercholesterolemia is caused 
by defects in the LDL receptor, resulting in increasing 
LDL circulating levels  in blood. In contrast to LDL, 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) transports choles-
terol to the liver  for excretion in the bile (see in the 
gallbladder section of Chapter 17, Digestive Glands).

After birth, angiogenesis contributes to organ growth.

• Kaposi’s sarcoma is a tumor characterized by red or purple vascular nodules 
in the skin (face and legs), mucosa (nose, mouth and throat) lung, liver, spleen, 
and gastrointestinal tract, frequently found in AIDS patients.
• The vascular patches, plaques, or nodules consist of spindle-shaped tumor 
cells and highly developed vascular spaces (see the histopathology image). The 
spindle cells express blood and lymphatic endothelial cell markers.  
• A severely weakened immune system in HIV infected individuals facilitates

Neovascularization during pathologic conditions

The formation of a blood vessel from a preexisting vessel, a process 
known as neovascularization, is relevant to chronic inflammation, 
development of collateral circulation, and tumor growth.

Formation of a mature blood vessel

         Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) interacts with the endothelial cell 
5
receptor Tie2 (for tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and 
EGF-like domains) to recruit periendothelial smooth muscle cells to 
organize mature blood vessels. 
    Ang2, another angiopoietin, interacts with Tie2 to induce the loss of 
contact of endothelial cells with the extracellular matrix. This results in 
either the absence of growth or death of endothelial cells. The role of 
Ang2 in tumor angiogenesis is emerging as a target for cancer 
treatment.

Mature blood vessel

In the adult, most blood vessels remain stable and 
angiogenesis  occurs  in  the  endometrium  and  ova-
ries during the menstrual cycle, and in the placenta 
during  pregnancy.    Under  pathologic  conditions, 
angiogenesis is excessive during malignant (see Box 
12-C),  ocular  (age-related  macular  degeneration), 
and inﬂammatory conditions. 

An understanding of vasculogenesis and angiogen-
esis is relevant to developing  therapeutic strategies 
to produce revascularization of ischemic tissues or 
inhibit angiogenesis in cancer, ocular, joint, or skin 
disorders.

The major key signaling pathways  involved in 
angiogenesis are: (1) the vascular endothelial cell factor 
(VEGF)-VEGF receptor (VEGF-R) pathway; (2) the Notch 
receptor pathway; and (3) the Tie (for tyrosine kinase with 
immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains) receptor– 
angiopoietin (Ang) pathway. 
   The VEGF-R and Tie receptors have an intracellular 
tyrosine kinase domain. Ligand binding to VEGF-R and Tie 
receptors leads to their dimerization and subsequent 
autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated receptor 
interacts with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules 
leading to angiogenesis involving the proliferation and 
differentiation of endothelial cells.  
   Activation of the Notch receptor by ligand (Dll/Jagged) 
binding results in the release of the Notch intracellular 
cell domain (NICD) that translocates into the cell nucleus 
to regulate gene expression involved in angiogenesis.

Based on the importance of VEGF and its receptor in tumor 
angiogenesis, blocking tumor angiogenesis by suppressing the 
angiogenic pathways can provide maximal surviving benefits to 
cancer patients.
    The monoclonal antibody to VEGF bevacizumab (Avastin) and 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) sunitinib and 
sorafenib have been developed. However, although tumor 
antiangiogenic targeted drugs inhibit primary tumor growth, they 
promote tumor invasion and metastasis. 
    The mechanism of tumor hypoxia, caused by oxygen 
deprivation resulting from blocking tumor angiogenesis, could 
explain the selective switch of tumor cells into an invasive and 
metastatic program.  Hypoxia–inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) acts as 
a transcription survival factor that activates genes involved in 
migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Hypoxia generated by 
tumor angiogenesis inhibition triggers pathways that make tumor 
cells aggressive and metastatic. 

menstrual  cycle,  placental  growth,  wound  healing, 
and inﬂammatory responses. We discuss below that 
tumor angiogenesis is a speciﬁc form of angiogenesis 
with important clinical implications.

Endothelial  cells  are  involved  in  vasculogenesis 
and angiogenesis. Endothelial cells migrate, prolifer-
ate, and assemble into tubes to contain the blood. 
Periendothelial cells (smooth muscle cells, pericytes, 
and ﬁbroblasts) are recruited to surround the newly 
formed endothelial tubes.

The  following  molecules  are  central  to  vascular 

morphogenesis: 

1. Vascular endothelial cell factors (VEGFs), with 

binding afﬁnity to two different receptors, VEGF-R1 
and VEGF-R2,  present on the surface of endothelial 
cells.

2. Tie2, a receptor tyrosine kinase that modulates a 
signaling cascade required for the induction or inhibi-
tion of endothelial cell proliferation. Angiopoietins 1 
and 2 (Ang1 and Ang2) bind to the Tie2 receptor (for 
tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-
like domains). Ang1 binding to Tie2 has a stabilizing 
effect on blood vessels (proangiogenic), whereas Ang2 
has a destabilizing effect (anti-angiogenic).

The extracellular region of VEGF-R and Tie recep-
tors is an immunoglobulin-like domain; the intracel-

lular domain has tyrosine kinase activity. Upon ligand 
binding, the receptors dimerize and the intracellular 
domain autophosphorylates. 

3. The Notch receptor is a third pathway (Figure 
12-17).  Notch  receptor  signaling  facilitates  endo-
thelial cell survival by activating the expression of a 
VEGF-R that protects endothelial cells from apop-
tosis. Notch receptor Delta-like ligands (Dll1, Dll3 
and Dll4) and Jagged (Jagged 1 and Jagged 2) play 
signiﬁcant roles in normal and tumoral angiogenesis 
by regulating the actions of VEGF. 

Activation  of  Notch  signaling  is  dependent  on 
cell-cell interaction. It occurs when the extracellular 
domain  of  Notch  receptor  interacts  with  a  ligand 
found on the surface of a nearby cell. Notch receptors 
participate in transcriptional regulation by a unique 
mechanism involving the cleavage of the Notch in-
tracellular domain (NICD), which then translocates 
to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. 

 

Pathology: Neovascularization and vascular 
co-option 
All the three signaling pathways, VEGF-R–VEGF, 
Tie-Ang, and Notch receptor-Dll/Jagged, contribute 
synergistically to the process of neoangiogenesis.  

Antineoangiogenic drugs exert therapeutic effects 
by blocking certain speciﬁc receptors of the VEGF-
VEGF-R pathway, but none can fully block all the 
components. Thus,  neoangiogenesis  signaling  can 
continue through the other signaling pathways.

In Chapter 4, Connective Tissue, we discuss the 
molecular  biology  of  tumor  invasion.  We  brieﬂy 
mention that tumors secrete angiogenic factors that 
increase the vascularization and nutrition of an invad-
ing tumor. During inﬂammation, angiogenic factors 
stimulate  the  formation  of  the  highly  vascularized 
granulation  tissue. The  participating  angiogenic 
factors are similar to those produced during normal 
wound healing. In addition, we indicate that newly 
formed blood vessels facilitate the dissemination of 
tumor cells to distant tissues (metastasis). 

Based on the concept that oxygen and nutrients 
provided  by  the  vasculature  is  essential  for  tumor 
growth and metastasis and on the role of VEGF and 
its receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(RTKIs)  in  angiogenesis,  tumor  antiangiogenic 
therapeutic approaches have been developed to pro-
vide cancer patients maximal survival time. Therapy 
with  angiogenesis  inhibitors  reduce  tumor  growth 
but promote tumor invasiveness and metastasis (see 
Figure 12-17).  

How  can  tumor  invasiveness  and  metastasis  be 
explained  following  VEGF-targeted  therapy?  A 
possible  mechanism  is  tumor  hypoxia.  Following 
antiangiogenic  tumor  treatment,  a  lack  of  oxygen 
supply  to  the  tumor  selects  for  metastasis  the  less 

sensitive  cells  to  treatment. These  cells  escape  the 
hypoxic environment leading to increasing metastasis 
by  expressing  hypoxia-inducible  factor-1  (HIF-1). 
HIF-1 is a survival factor of cancer cells by activating 
transcription of genes involved in angiogenesis. We 
discussed in Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopiesis, the 
role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1(cid:95) in the production 
of erytropoietin, a regulator of erythropoiesis, under 
conditions of low oxygen tension.

The  identification  of  biomarkers  to  monitor 
metastasis  switch  and  resistance  of  cancer  cells  to 
antiangiogenic strategies could overcome the adverse 
effects of tumor-starving therapy.

However, some primary and metastatic tumors can 
develop and progress in the absence of angiogenesis 
by  adapting,  or  co-opting,  to  a  preexisting  blood 
vessel. Vascular co-option is relevant to forthcoming 
tumor therapy by discriminating between angiogenic 
and nonangiogenic tumor growth, thus preventing 
tumor cells to attach and grow along the outer surface 
of blood vessels.

In Chapter 8, Nervous Tissue, we discuss the peri-
vascular development of metastasis in brain. Meta-
static  tumor  cells  co-opt,  or  assimilate,  to  existing 
brain vessels by expressing the protein neuroserpin. 
Neuroserpin blocks plasmin and soluble Fas ligand, 
that prevent brain metastasis by inducing apoptosis 
of tumor cells entering the brain tissue.  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hypertension
We already discussed atherosclerosis, a chronic inﬂam-
matory arterial disease. Arteriosclerosis describes the 
thickening and hardening of the arterial walls without 
any reference to the cause. The cause of atheroscle-
rosis, the most common cause of arteriosclerosis, is 
the development of an atheroma. You have learned 
how atheromas affect large and medium-sized arter-
ies and determine the thickening and hardening of 
the arterial wall.

You have also learned how defects of the vascular 
tunica media can determine an aneurysm, the abnor-
mal regional dilation of the abdominal aorta or of a 
cerebral artery. If hereditary disorders such as Marfan’s 
syndrome and a form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 
result in degenerative changes in the tunica media of 
the aorta, aortic dissection is a likely outcome.

Hypertension  (diastolic  blood  pressure  greater 
than 90 mm Hg) is another condition that causes 
degenerative changes in the walls of the small vessels 
(arterioles). The vasculature of the brain, heart and 
kidneys and the aorta are the most affected.

There  are  two  etiologic  forms  of  hypertension 

(Figure 12-18):

1. Primary (essential) hypertension, without ap-
parent cause, usually associated with genetic predis-
position, obesity, alcohol consumption, and aging.

2. Secondary hypertension, related to an activation 
of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), discussed in 
Chapter 14, Urinary System. Mutations in the genes 
involved in RAS, affecting Na+ metabolism and blood 
volume, are important factors. Other factors include 
pheochromocytoma  (epinephrine/norepinephrine–
producing tumor of the adrenal medulla), congenital 
narrowing of the aorta (coartaction of the aorta) and 
stenosis (abnormal narrowing) by atherosclerosis of 
one renal artery.

There are two clinical forms of hypertension:
1.  Benign  hypertension,  consisting  in  a  gradual 
increase of blood pressure caused by hypertrophy of 
the muscular tunica media of small arteries, thicken-
ing of  the intima and the internal elastic lamina and 
reduction in the diameter of the vascular lumen. The 
smooth muscle cells of the wall of the arterioles un-
dergo hyaline degeneration and thickening (hyaline 
arteriolosclerosis), depriving the normal constriction 
and dilation of the vessel.

2.  Malignant  hypertension,  consisting  in  acute 
degeneration and proliferative reparative events of the 
wall of small vessels causing substantial reduction of 
the vascular lumen.

Pathology: Thrombosis, embolism, and infarction
Thrombosis is the process of formation of a blood 
clot  (thrombus)  inside  a  blood  vessel,  obstructing 
blood ﬂow. 

One or more of the following three factors (Vir-
chow’s triad, Figure 12-19) can lead to thrombosis:
1.  Endothelial  dysfunction  can  occur  by  direct 
trauma or inﬂammation associated with an atheroma, 
a condition called atherothrombosis. Under normal 
conditions,  the  endothelial  lining  prevents  throm-
bosis. As you recall, endothelial damage triggers the 
adhesion  and  aggregation  of  platelets,  the  starting 
point of thrombus formation (see Figure 12-14). 

2. Reduction in blood ﬂow can be caused by seden-

tary behavior (for example, sitting on a long airplane 
ﬂight) or beyond a site of vascular injury, thus allowing 
platelets to contact the endothelial cell surface and 
activate components of the clotting cascade.

3. Prone to blood clotting (hypercoagulability), 
determined, among other causes, by an increase in 
the concentration of ﬁbrinogen and prothrombin as-
sociated with estrogen-based therapy, autoantibodies 
to platelet phospholipids and a common mutation in 
factor V (Leiden mutation), a cofactor that allows fac-
tor Xa to activate thrombin. Remember that thrombin 
cleaves ﬁbrinogen to form ﬁbrin, which then organizes 
a dense meshwork, the substrate of a blood clot. 

The  mechanism of blood clotting, or hemostasis, 
the intrinsic, extrinsic and common pathways of blood 
clotting and the mechanism of ﬁbrinolysis, to dissolve 
a thrombus, are described in Chapter 6, Blood and 
Hematopoiesis. 

Note that a thrombus consists of layered compo-
nents of the blood coagulation cascade (platelets, ﬁ-
brin and entrapped blood cells) formed inside a blood 
vessel. In contrast, a blood clot, such as a hematoma, 
consists of similar unstructured components that have 
developed outside a blood vessel.   

Obstruction  of  more  of  75%  of  the  lumen  of 
an  artery  reduces  blood  flow  and  oxygen  supply 
(hypoxia). An obstruction that exceeds 90% of the 
lumen of an artery causes anoxia (complete reduction 
of oxygen) and infarction (tissue necrosis). Details of 
the pathogenesis of cell and tissue injury and necrosis 
are discussed in Chapter 3, Cell Signaling.

There are two distinct forms of thrombosis: 
1. Venous thrombosis.
2. Arterial thrombosis.
Venous thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus 

within a vein. This category includes:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The iliac, femoral,  
popliteal and calf veins are the most commonly af-
fected. Swelling, pain and redness of the affected area 
are characteristic indications of DVT.

2. Portal vein thrombosis. The hepatic portal vein is 
usually affected. It can determine portal hypertension 
and reduction of liver blood supply. It is associated 
with cirrhosis and  pancreatitis.

3. Budd-Chiari syndrome, caused by the blockage 
of the hepatic vein or the inferior vena cava, this form 
of thrombosis is deﬁned by abdominal pain, ascites, 
and hepatomegaly.

4. Paget-Schroetter disease, caused by the obstruc-
tion of an upper extremity vein (such as the axillary 
vein or subclavian vein) by a thrombus. It is seen after 
intense exercise in healthy and young individuals.

5. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), is a 
type of stroke resulting from the blockage of the dural 
venous sinuses by a thrombus.

Arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus

within an artery.  This category includes:

1.  Stroke.  Atherothrombosis  stroke  originated 
in an atheroma located in large vessels (such as the 
internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of Willis) 
or  in  smaller  vessels  (such  as  the  branches  of  the 
circle of Willis).

2. Myocardial infarction. We discuss in Chapter 
3, Cell Signaling, and in Chapter 7, Muscle Tissue, 
several  aspects  of  myocardial  ischemia  (produced 
by slow occlusion of a blood vessel) and infarction 
(determined by an abrupt vascular occlusion). 

In  general,  arterial  blockage  causes  coagulative 
necrosis, whereas  the blockage of a vein determines 
hemorrhagic necrosis.

  A  thrombus  can  enlarge  its  size  (propagation), 
dissolved  by  fibrinolysis,  become  organized  by 
undergoing a granulation tissue transformation and 
reestablish blood ﬂow by recanalization.

A potential outcome of a thrombus is thrombo-
embolism,  consisting  in  the  fragmentation  of  the 
thrombus  and  migration  of  the  fragments,  called 
emboli,  to  other  blood  vessels.  If  the  destination 
blood vessels have a small lumen, the thromboemboli 
cannot progress further, end up occluding the lumen 
and depriving local blood ﬂow to produce infarction.
Thromboemboli can cause pulmonary thrombo-

embolism  when  emboli  of  systemic  veins  migrate 
to the heart and affect the pulmonary arterial tree.

 Most emboli derive from DVT and, depending 
on the extent of vasculature blockage and size of the 
affected  pulmonary  arteries,  thromboemboli  can 
trigger  an  increase  in  pulmonary  arterial  pressure,  
Atherothrombosis stroke  (causing in some cases lung
infarction) and straining the right-side of the heart. A 
substantial sudden blockage (60% of the pulmonary 
vasculature; massive pulmonary embolism) produces 
a  cardiovascular  collapse  leading  to  rapid  death. 
Minor  pulmonary  embolism  can  result  from  the 
blockage of small peripheral lung vessels and cause 
pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. 

A heart mural thrombus can migrate through the 
aorta to the systemic arterial circulation and occlude 
an artery of the brain, kidneys, spleen, intestines and 
lower extremities. 

Not all emboli originate from arterial and venous 
thromboembolism. Tumor embolism is the source 
of  hematogenous  metastasis.  Severe  bone  fracture 
can  cause  fat  and  bone  marrow  emboli  to  enter 
the venous system and reach the pulmonary arteries 
through the right side of the heart.  Accidental air 
pumping into the venous circulation can trigger air 
embolism.

Cardiovascular System

• Heart. The wall of the heart consists of three 
layers: 
  (1) Endocardium, formed by an endothelial 
lining and subendothelial connective tissues.
  (2) Myocardium, formed by three types 
of cardiac muscle: atrial muscle, ventricular 
muscle, and conducting muscle ﬁbers of 
Purkinje.
  (3) Epicardium, lined by a mesothelium 
facing the serosal pericardial space. The epicar-
dium is the visceral layer of the pericardium. 
  Cardiocytes of the atrium secrete atrial natri-
uretic factor, a protein that stimulates diuresis 
and natriuresis.
  The conductive systems of the heart are the 
sinus node (or sinoatrial [S-A] node); the inter-
nodal pathway, linking the sinus node to the 
atrioventricular (A-V) node; the atrioventricular 
bundle, linking the atria to the ventricles; and 
the left and right bundles of Purkinje ﬁbers. 
  Cardiocytes are striated cells with a central 
nucleus and are linked to each other by 
intercalated disks. The transverse components 
of the intercalated disk are fasciae adherentes 
and desmosomes; gap junctions are present 
in the longitudinal component. The cytoplasm 
contains myoﬁbrils. 
  Purkinje cells lie beneath the endocardium 
along the two sides of the interventricular sep-
tum. Compared with cardiocytes, the number 
of myoﬁbrils in Purkinje ﬁbers is reduced, the 
diameter of the ﬁbers is larger, and the cyto-
plasm contains abundant glycogen. 

• Circulation is divided into: 
  (1) The systemic or peripheral circulation.

  (2) The pulmonary circulation. 
  Remember that there are variations in blood 
pressure in various parts of the cardiovascular 
system. The construction of the blood vessels 
matches the blood pressure that they must 
sustain. As blood ﬂows through the systemic 
circulation, its pressure reaches the lowest 
value when it returns to the right atrium of the 
heart through the terminal vena cava.

  Arteries conduct blood from the heart to the 
capillaries. The wall of arteries consists of three 
layers: 
  (1) Tunica intima (endothelium, subendothe-
lial connective tissue, and the internal elastic 
lamina).
  (2) Tunica media (smooth muscle cells 
surrounded by collagen ﬁbers, and elastic 
sheaths).
  (3) Tunica externa or adventitia (connective 
tissue, vessels, and nerves). 
  There are three major groups of arteries: 
  (1) Large elastic arteries.
  (2) Medium-sized arteries.
  (3) Small arteries and arterioles.
   Large elastic arteries are conducting vessels. 
The aorta is an example. Fenestrated elastic 
sheaths and elastic-producing smooth muscle 
cells are present in the tunica media. Aortic 
aneurysms are produced by atherosclero-
sis or defective synthesis and assembly of 
elastic ﬁbers (Marfan syndrome, dissecting 
aneurysm).
   Medium-sized arteries are distributing 
vessels. The tunica media shows a reduction 
in elastic ﬁbers and an increase in smooth 

muscle ﬁbers. An external elastic lamina is 
seen at the tunica media–adventitia junction.
   Arterioles are resistance vessels. Arterioles 
regulate blood distribution to the microcircula-
tion by vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Arte-
rioles are the major determinants of systemic 
blood pressure. The tunica media consists of 
two to ﬁve layers of smooth muscle.

   Capillaries are exchange vessels. The 
microvascular bed, the site of microcirculation, 
consists of the terminal arteriole, metarteri-
ole, the capillary bed, and the postcapillary 
venules. 
  The capillary bed consists of slightly larger 
capillaries (called preferential or thorough-
fare channels) characterized by continuous 
blood ﬂow, and small capillaries (called true 
capillaries), where blood ﬂow is intermittent. 
Precapillary sphincters (smooth muscle cells) 
are located at the origin site of  true capillaries 
from the arteriole or metarteriole. Capil-
lary circulation can be bypassed by through 
channels connecting terminal arterioles to 
postcapillary venules. Arteriovenous shunts, or 
anastomoses, connect arterioles to postcapil-
lary venules, bypassing the microvascular bed.
  There are three types of capillaries: 
  (1) Continuous capillaries.
  (2) Fenestrated capillaries.
  (3) Discontinuous (sinusoids). 
  Continuous capillaries are lined by a com-
plete simple squamous endothelium and 
continuous basal lamina. Pericytes, smooth 
muscle cell–like, can be present between the 
endothelium and the basal lamina. Endotheli-

al cells have two characteristics: they are linked 
by tight junctions, and the transport of solutes 
and ﬂuids occurs by caveolae and pinocytotic 
vesicles.
   Fenestrated capillaries have pores, or fenes-
trae, with or without diaphragms. The basal 
lamina is continuous.
   Discontinuous capillaries have an incom-
plete endothelial cell lining and basal lamina. 
Gaps are seen between and within endothelial 
cells.

   Veins are capacitance or reservoir vessels. 
The venous system starts with a postcapil-
lary venule (the site of migration of blood 
cells into tissues by diapedesis), consisting 
of an endothelial tube surrounded by a basal 
lamina, and a loose connective tissue adven-
titia. In lymphatic tissues, endothelial cells of 
postcapillary venules are taller (high endothe-
lial venules). Postcapillary venules converge 
to form muscular venules, which give rise to 
collecting venules, leading to veins of increas-
ing diameter.
  Veins have the following characteristics: 
  (1) Distinction of a tunica media from a 
tunica adventitia is often not discernible. 
  (2) A distinct internal elastic lamina is not 
visualized. 
  (3) Veins have valves, projections into the 
lumen of the tunica intima, to prevent blood 
reﬂux.

  Lymphatic vessels conduct immune cells 
and lymph to lymph nodes, remove excess 
ﬂuid accumulated in interstitial spaces, and 
transport chylomicrons collected by lacteal 
lymphatic vessels. Lymph ﬂow is under low 
pressure and unidirectional.
  Lymphatic capillaries begin as dilated, blind 
endothelial cell–lined tubes lacking a basal 
lamina and maintained open by bundles of 
anchoring ﬁlaments. Lymphatic vessels are not 
found in cartilage, bone, epithelia, the central 
nervous system, and placenta.
  Lymphatic capillaries converge into precol-
lecting lymphatic vessels draining lymph into 
collecting lymphatic vessels surrounded by 
smooth muscle cells, providing intrinsic pump-
ing activity. 
  Lymphangions are bulblike segments sepa-
rated by luminal valves. 
  Terminal lymphatic vessels are seen in the 
proximity of a lymph node. Lymph returns to 
the bloodstream through the large thoracic 
duct, and the smaller right lymphatic duct.
  Lymphedema is caused by a defect in the 
transport of lymph determined by abnormal 
development or a damaged lymphatic vessel. 
  Filariasis (elephantiasis) is caused by a 
parasitic infection of lymphatic vessels. Chronic 
lymphedema of the legs and genitals is 
characteristic. 
  Chylous ascites and chylothorax is the 
accumulation of lymph with high fat content 
(chyle)  in the abdomen and thorax, caused 
by trauma, obstruction, or abnormal develop-
ment of lymphatic vessels.

• Special capillary arrangements:
  (1) Arterial portal system: afferent arteriole 
followed by a capillary network draining into an 
efferent arteriole (instead of a venule). 
  (2) Venous portal system: capillary drained 
by a vein, which gives rise to venous capillaries 
or sinusoids and continues with a vein.

•  Endothelial cell functions:
   (1) Production of prostacyclin (from arachi-
donic acid) to avoid adhesion of platelets to 
the endothelium and intravascular blood clot 
formation, and to determine the relaxation of 
the smooth muscle cell wall. 
  (2) Production of angiogenic factors during 
normal wound healing and vascularization of 
tumors. 
  (3) Initiation of blood coagulation by releas-
ing tissue factor to activate factor VIIa to 
convert factor X into factor Xa. 
  (4) Regulation of smooth muscle activity 
(nitric oxide produces vasodilation; endothelin 
1 triggers vasoconstriction). 
  (5) Regulation of inﬂammatory cell trafﬁcking. 
Macrophages in the connective tissue produce 
tumor necrosis factor ligand  (TNFL) and inter-
leukin-1 to accelerate homing of inﬂammatory 
cells to block the action of pathogens.

• Arterial diseases. Atherosclerosis is the 
thickening of the arterial walls caused by 
atherosclerotic plaques of lipids, cells, and con-
nective tissue in the tunica intima. 
  Atherosclerosis is  a chronic inﬂamma-
tory disease involving the participation of 
monocytes that change into macrophages that 
internalize modiﬁed low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL).
  There are four phases involving the develop-
ment of an atheroma plaque.
  (1) Endothelial cell dysfunction. Damage 
to the endothelium of an artery, caused by 
hypercholesterolemia, is followed by the 
recruitment of blood monocytes in the tunica 
intima. In the intima, monocytes change into 
macrophages expressing scavenger receptor-A 
(SR-A) that internalizes modiﬁed   cholesterol-
rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL-contain-
ing multilocular deposits give macrophages a 
foamy appearance. 
  (2) Formation of the atherosclerosis plaque. 
The atherosclerotic plaque developed in the 
intima consists of an atheroma core with 
abundant macrophages foamy cells and a 
ﬁbrous cap. The ﬁbrous cap contains collagen 
ﬁbers produced by migrating smooth muscle 
cells from the tunica media.
  (3) T cells–macrophage interaction. Re-
cruited T cells contribute additional inﬂamma-
tory components to the atherosclerotic plaque. 
T cell– macrophage interaction results in the 
production of metalloproteinases (MMPs) by 
macrophages and proinﬂammatory cytokines 
by T cells.
  (4) Fracture of the plaque and thrombosis. 
MMPs and inﬂammatory cytokines weaken 
and fracture the ﬁbrous cap. The thrombo-
genic potential of the plaque, resulting from 
the production of procoagulant tissue factor 

by macrophages, causes thrombosis leading 
to the obstruction or occlusion of the arterial 
lumen.
   The abdominal aorta, and the coronary and 
cerebral arteries are the major blood vessels 
involved. Abdominal aortic aneurysm, myo-
cardial infarction, and brain infarct (stroke) are 
complications. 
  Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic 
defect in the lipoprotein metabolism caused 
by a defect in the receptor that internalizes 
LDL. 

• Vasculitis. Vasculitis is the acute and chronic 
inﬂammation of vessels. It can be caused by 
infectious and immunologic pathogens.
  The lytic activity of bacterial enzymes follow-
ing bacterial infections cause vasculitis, throm-
bophlebitis (thrombosis and inﬂammation of 
the wall of a vein), and pseudoaneurysms 
(dilation of the wall of a blood vessel).
  Most inﬂammatory conditions of the wall of 
arteries involve an immune-based pathogen-
esis:
  (1) Antigen-antibody complexes, accumulat-
ing in the wall of a blood vessel, can activate 
the complement cascade.
  (2) When neutrophils attracted by chemo-
tactic fragments released by the activated 
complement cascade and cytokines, release 
serine proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, 
causing damage to the vascular wall.
  (3) Antibodies reacting with cytoplasmic 
components of neutrophils (anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody, ANCA) release enzymes 
from the activated neutrophils, causing vascu-
lar wall injury. 
(4) Serine proteinase 3 generates C-ANCA 
(cytoplasmic ANCA); P-ANCA are antibodies 
to myeloperoxidase showing a perinuclear 
pattern in neutrophils (perinuclear ANCA) by 
immunocytochemistry.
  Vasculitis types include:
  (1) Giant cell arteritis, a common form of 
vasculitis in adults (over the age of 50) that 
affects temporal, ophthalmic or vertebral 
arteries.
  (2) Buerger’s disease (thromboangitis 
obliterans), involves medium-sized and small 
arteries of hands and feet of young males, 
who are heavy cigarette smokers. 
  (3) Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) affects the 
wall of medium-  to small-sized arteries of the 
skin, kidneys, liver, heart and gastrointestinal 
tract. PAN has been associated with active 
hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. 
  (4) Giant cell aortitis (Takayasu’s arteritis) 
is a rare disease that occurs with a high fre-
quency in Asian women under the age of 40 
and affects the aorta and its branches. 
  (5) Kaswasaki’s disease affects the coronary 
arteries as well as large, medium- and small-
sized arteries of children. 
  (6) Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a 
systemic vasculitis associated with asthma, 
rhinitis and eosinophilia.
  (7) Wegener’s granulomatosis  is a nec-
rotizing arteritis of the respiratory tract and 
kidneys.

  (8) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is 
the most common form of vasculitis in 
children.

• Hemorrhage is caused by the rupture of 
a blood vessel, determined by trauma  to a 
major artery or vein or the rupture of a blood 
vessel because of wall fragility. Signiﬁcant 
blood loss can determine hypovolemic shock, 
manifested by a severe drop in blood pres-
sure. 
  Hematoma is a localized accumulation of 
blood in a tissue, usually following an injury.
  Small hemorrhages of the skin are:
  (1) Petechiae (less than 3 mm in diameter).
  (2) Purpura (less than 10 mm in diameter).
  (3) Ecchymosis (greater than 10 mm).

• Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vascu-
logenesis is the process initiated by vascular 
endothelial progenitors (called angioblasts) 
during embryogenesis.
   Angiogenesis is a process of vessel forma-
tion initiated from a preexisting vessel, and it is 
observed in the embryo and adult. Endothe-
lial cells are involved in vasculogenesis and 
angiogenesis. 
   During  vasculogenesis, angioblasts prolifer-
ate and assemble into tubes containing blood. 
Periendothelial cells (smooth muscle cells, 
pericytes, and ﬁbroblasts) are recruited to 
complete the formation of the vessel. Endo-
thelial proliferation is regulated by vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), secreted 
by mesenchymal cells, bound to its receptor 
VEGF-R1. Angiopoietin interacts with the en-
dothelial cell receptor Tie2 to recruit perien-
dothelial cells (pericytes and smooth muscle 
cells). During angiogenesis, a capillary sprout 
is formed from podosomes of a preexisting 
endothelial cell. Endothelial cells, stimulated 
by VEGF and angiopoietin, form an endothe-
lial tube. The recruitment of periendothelial 
smooth muscle cells follows.
   The Notch receptor pathway contributes, 
together with the VEGF-VEGF-R and the 
Tie1-angiopoietin pathways, to the process of 
angiogenesis.
   •  Tumor angiogenesis. Blocking blood 
supply starves tumors. Tumor antiangiogenic 
therapeutic approaches disrupting angiogenic 
pathways have been developed. Tumor 
hypoxia reduces the tumor size but also can-
cerous cells, less sensitive to hypoxia, escape 
the tumor site and establish metastatic tumor 
growth by expressing hypoxia-inducible fac-
tor-1, a transcription factor that activates the 
genes involved in angiogenesis.
  However, some primary and metastatic 
tumors can develop and progress in the 
absence of angiogenesis by adapting, or co-
opting, to a preexisting blood vessel. 
  Vascular co-option is relevant to forthcom-
ing tumor therapy by discriminating between 
angiogenic and nonangiogenic tumor growth. 
The goal is to prevent tumor cells to attach 
and grow along the outer surface of blood 
vessels.

• Hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 
greater than 90 mm of Hg) is another condi-
tion that causes degenerative changes in the 
walls of the small vessels (arterioles). The 
vasculature of the brain, heart and kidneys 
and the aorta are the most affected.
  There are two causes of hypertension: 
  (1) Primary (essential) hypertension, 
without apparent cause, usually associated 
with genetic predisposition, obesity, alcohol 
consumption and aging.
  (2) Secondary hypertension, related to an 
activation of the renin-angiotensin system 
(RAS).
There are two clinical forms of hypertension:
  (1) Benign hypertension, consisting in a 
gradual increase of blood pressure caused by 
hypertrophy of the muscular tunica media of 
small arteries, thickening of  the intima and 
the internal elastic lamina and reduction in 
the diameter of the vascular lumen.
  (2) Malignant hypertension, consisting in 
acute degeneration and proliferation of the 
wall of small vessels causing reduction of the 
vascular lumen.

• Thrombosis is the process of formation of a 
blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel, 
obstructing blood ﬂow.
  One or more of the following three factors 
(Virchow’s triad) can lead to thrombosis:
  (1) Endothelial dysfunction can occur by 
direct trauma or inﬂammation associated with 
an atheroma, a condition called atherothrom-
bosis.
  (2) Reduction in blood ﬂow can be caused 
by sedentary behavior (for example, sitting 
on a long airplane ﬂight) or beyond a site of 
vascular injury.
  (3) Prone to blood clotting (hypercoagula-
bility).
  A thrombus consists of layered components 
of the blood coagulation cascade (platelets, 
ﬁbrin and entrapped blood cells) formed 
inside a blood vessel. In contrast, a blood clot, 
such as a hematoma, consists of similar un-
structured components that have developed 
outside a blood vessel.
  Obstruction of more of 75% of the lumen 
of an artery reduces blood ﬂow and oxygen 
supply (hypoxia). An obstruction that exceeds 
90% of the lumen of an artery causes anoxia 
(complete reduction of oxygen) and infarc-
tion (tissue necrosis).
  There are two distinct forms of thrombosis: 
  (1) Venous thrombosis.
  (2) Arterial thrombosis.

• Venous thrombosis is the formation of 
a thrombus within a vein. This category 
includes:
  (1) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The iliac, 
femoral,  popliteal and calf veins are the most 
commonly affected. 
  (2) Portal vein thrombosis. The hepatic por-
tal vein is usually affected. It can determine 
portal hypertension and reduction of liver 

blood supply. It is associated with cirrhosis 
and pancreatitis.
  (3) Budd-Chiari syndrome, caused by the 
blockage of the hepatic vein or the inferior 
vena cava. This form of thrombosis is as-
sociated with abdominal pain, ascites, and 
hepatomegaly.
  (4) Paget-Schroetter disease, caused by the 
obstruction of an upper extremity vein (such 
as the axillary vein or subclavian vein) by a 
thrombus. It is seen after intense exercise in 
healthy and young individuals.
  (5) Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 
(CVST), is a type of stroke resulting from the 
blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a 
thrombus.

• Arterial thrombosis is the formation of 
a thrombus within an artery.  This category 
includes:
  (1) Stroke. Atherothrombosis stroke origi-
nated in an atheroma located in large vessels 
(such as the internal carotids, vertebral and 
the circle of Willis) or in smaller vessels (such 
as the branches of the circle of Willis).
  (2) Myocardial ischemia, produced by slow 
occlusion of a blood vessel and myocardial 
infarction (determined by an abrupt vascular 
occlusion). 
  In general, arterial blockage causes coagula-
tive necrosis, whereas  the blockage of a vein 
determines hemorrhagic necrosis.
  A thrombus can enlarge its size (propaga-
tion), dissolved by ﬁbrinolysis, become 
organized by undergoing a granulation tissue 
transformation and reestablish blood ﬂow by 
recanalization.
  A potential outcome of a thrombus is 
thromboembolism, consisting in the frag-
mentation of the thrombus and migration of 
the fragments, called emboli, to other blood 
vessels.
  If the destination blood vessels have a 
small lumen, the thromboemboli cannot 
progress further, end up occluding the lumen 
and depriving local blood ﬂow to produce 
infarction.
  Thromboemboli can cause pulmonary 
thromboembolism when emboli of systemic 
veins migrate to the heart and affect the 
pulmonary arterial tree. A substantial sud-
den blockage (60% of the pulmonary 
vasculature; massive pulmonary embolism) 
produces a cardiovascular collapse leading to 
rapid death. Minor pulmonary embolism can 
result from the blockage of small peripheral 
lung vessels and cause pleuritic chest pain 
and dyspnea. 

  A heart mural thrombus can migrate 
through the aorta to the systemic arterial 
circulation and occlude an artery of the 
brain, kidneys, spleen, intestines and lower 
extremities. Severe bone fracture can cause 
fat and bone marrow emboli to enter the 
venous system and reach the pulmonary 
arteries through the right side of the heart.

13. Respiratory System

The respiratory system consists of three main portions with distinct functions: (1) An air-conducting portion.
(2) A respiratory portion for gas exchange between blood and air. (3) A mechanism for ventilation, driven by 
the inspiratory and expiratory movements of the thoracic cage. The air-conducting portion consists, sequentially, 
of the nasal cavities and associated sinuses, the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, the larynx, the trachea, the bron-
chi, and the bronchioles. The oropharynx also participates in food transport. The conducting portion provides a 
passage for inhaled and exhaled air in and out of the respiratory portion. The respiratory portion is composed, 
in sequence, of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. The main function is the 
exchange of gases between air and blood. Respiration involves the participation of a ventilation mechanism. 
The inﬂow (inspiration) and outﬂow (expiration) of air occur with the aid of four elements: (1) The thoracic or 
rib cage. (2) Associated intercostal muscles. (3) The diaphragm muscle. (4) The elastic connective tissue of the 
lungs. This chapter addresses the structure and function of the respiratory system leading to an understanding 
of pathologic abnormalities.

Nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses
The nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses provide an 
extensive surface area for:

1. Warming and moistening air.
2. Filtering dust particles present in the inspired air. 
In addition, the roof of each nasal cavity and part 
of the superior concha contain the specialized olfac-
tory mucosa.

Each nasal cavity, separated from the other by the 
septum,  consists  of  the  vestibule,  the  respiratory 
portion, and the olfactory area (Figure 13-1).  

Air  enters  through  the  nostril,  or  naris,  whose 
external  surface  is  lined  by  keratinized  squamous 
epithelium. At the vestibule, the epithelium becomes 
nonkeratinized. 

The respiratory portion is lined by a pseudostrati-
ﬁed ciliated epithelium with  goblet cells supported 
by the lamina propria, which consists of connective 

tissue with seromucous glands. The lamina propria 
has  a  rich  superficial  venous  plexus,  known  as 
cavernous or erectile tissue. The lamina propria is 
continuous with the periosteum or perichondrium 
of bone or cartilage, respectively, forming the wall of 
the nasal cavities.

Projecting into each nasal cavity from the lateral 
wall  are  three  curved  plates  of  bone  covered  by  a 
mucosa: the superior, middle, and inferior turbinate 
bones, or conchae (Latin concha, shell).

Secretions from goblet cells and seromucous glands 
maintain  the  turbinate  mucosal  surface  moist  and 
humidify the inspired air. 

Incoming air is warmed by blood in the venous 
plexus, which ﬂows in a direction opposite to that of 
the inspired air  (countercurrent ﬂow). The highly 
vascular nature of the nasal mucosa, in particular of 
the  anterior  septum,  accounts  for  common  bleed-

Local vascular changes controlled by 
vasomotor autonomic innervation can 
modify the thickness of the mucosa, 
resulting in changes in the rate of airflow 
through the nasal passages.

Groups of unmyelinated axons form 
nerve fascicles (called olfactory fila) that 
pass through the cribriform plate of the 
ethmoid bone to terminate in the 
glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.

ing (epistaxis) after trauma or acute inﬂammation 
(rhinitis). 

Conchae cause airﬂow turbulence, thus facilitat-
ing contact between the air and the mucus blanket 
covering the respiratory region of each nasal cavity.  
The mucus blanket traps particulates in the air that 
are transported posteriorly by ciliary action to the na-
sopharynx, where they are swallowed with the saliva.
Paranasal sinuses are air-containing cavities within 
the bones of the skull. They are the maxillary, frontal, 
ethmoidal,  and  sphenoid  sinuses. The  sinuses  are 
lined by a thin pseudostratiﬁed columnar ciliated 
epithelium,  with  fewer  goblet  cells  and  glands  in 
the lamina propria. No erectile tissue is present in 
the paranasal sinuses. 

Sinuses  communicate  with  the  nasal  cavity  by 
openings lined by an epithelium similar to that of 
the main nasal cavity.  The ethmoidal  sinuses open 
beneath the superior conchae and the maxillary sinus 
opens under the middle concha.

Nasopharynx
The  posterior  portion  of  the  nasal  cavities  is  the 
nasopharynx,  which  at  the  level  of  the  soft  palate 
becomes the oropharynx. 

The auditory tubes (eustachian tubes), extending 
from the middle ear, open into the lateral walls of 
the nasopharynx. 

The  nasopharynx  is  lined  by  a  pseudostratiﬁed 
columnar  epithelium  like  the  nasal  cavities,  and 
changes into nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium 
at  the  oropharynx.  Abundant  mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue is present beneath the nasopharyn-

geal epithelium, forming the Waldeyer’s ring (formed 
by  the  two  palatine  tonsils,  the  nasopharyngeal 
tonsils,  the  lingual  tonsils  and  mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue, MALT). The nasopharyngeal ton-
sils (called adenoids when enlarged by inﬂammation) 
are present at the posterior and upper regions of the 
nasopharynx. 

Olfactory epithelium
The olfactory epithelium contains three major types 
of cells (Figures 13-2; see Box 13-A):

1. Basal cells.
2. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
3. Supporting or sustentacular cells.
The  basal  cells  are  mitotically  active  stem  cells, 
producing daughter cells that differentiate ﬁrst into 
immature OSNs and then into mature OSNs. OSNs 
proliferate during adult life. Their life span is about 
30 to 60 days.

The OSN is highly polarized bipolar cell (Figure 
13-3). The apical region, facing the surface of the 
mucosa,  consists  of  a  specialized  dendrite  with  a 
knoblike ending (called olfactory vesicle or olfactory 
knob). About 10 to 20 modiﬁed cilia emerge from the 
knoblike ending. The basal region of the olfactory 
sensory neuron gives rise to an axon. 

Several  axons,  projecting  from  the  OSNs,  form 
small  unmyelinated  bundles  (called  olfactory  ﬁla; 
from Latin ﬁlum, thread), surrounded by glial-like 
cells. Nerve bundles, forming the ﬁrst cranial nerve, 
cross the multiple openings of the cribriform plate 
of the ethmoid bone and contact in the glomerulus 
the dendrites of mitral cells (neurons of the olfactory 

410

bulb) to establish appropriate synaptic connections 
(see Figure 13-3 and Box 13-A).

The  supporting  or  sustentacular  cells  are  non-
sensory epithelial cells with numerous apical micro-
villi and secretory granules releasing their contents 
onto the mucosal surface.

Olfactory serous glands, called glands of Bowman, 
are present under the epithelium and secrete a serous 
ﬂuid in which odoriferous substances are dissolved. 
The  secretory  ﬂuid  contains  the  odorant-binding 
protein (OBP) with high binding afﬁnity for a large 
number of odorant molecules. 

OBP carries odorants to receptors present on the 
surface of the modiﬁed cilia and removes them after 
they  have  been  sensed.  In  addition,  the  secretory 
product of the glands of Bowman contains protective 
substances such as lysozyme and immunoglobulin A 
(IgA) secreted by plasma cells.

The odorant transduction pathway involves:
1. G protein and activation of adenylyl cyclase 3, 
which  produces  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(cAMP) (see Figure 13-3). 

2. cAMP regulates the phosphorylation of proteins 
and the transcription of genes involved in the growth 
and survival of OSNs.

3. cAMP binds to a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) 
ion channel, allowing the inﬂux of Ca2+ and Na+ and 
efﬂux of  intracellular Cl–. 

4. The ion ﬂow depolarizes the cell membrane of 
the  modiﬁed  cilia  and  generates  action  potentials 
propagated down the axon of the OSNs to the syn-
apses in the glomeruli, located in the olfactory bulb.
5. The glomerulus behave as a functional unit to 
which  sensory  input  signals  converge  and  become 
activated  before  transmission  to  the  corticomedial 
amygdala portion of the brain.

 Box 13-A  | Olfactory epithelium: Highlights to remember

• The olfactory epithelium consists of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), 
basal cells (a stem cell that differentiates into OSNs), and sustentacular or 
supporting cells. These cells can be identiﬁed on the basis of the position and 
shape of their nuclei (see Figure 13-3).
•  An OSN is a bipolar neuron. It has two portions: an apical dendrite with a 
knob bearing about 10 to 20 olfactory nonmotile modiﬁed cilia and a basal 
axon, forming bundles that pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid 
bone. 
• Cilia contain the odorant receptor (OR). There are about 1000 genes 
expressing ORs, but each OSN expresses only one OR gene.
• Secretions of the serous glands of Bowman contain odorant-binding protein.
• Axons from OSNs with the same OR terminate in one to three glomeruli pres-
ent in the olfactory bulb. Dendritic endings of predominantly mitral cells extend 
into the glomeruli. Axons of mitral cells form the olfactory tract.
• OSNs have a life span of 30 to 60 days and can regenerate from basal cells.
• Temporary or permanent damage to the olfactory epithelium causes anosmia 
(Greek an, not; osme, sense of smell). 

Larynx
The two main functions of the larynx are:

1. To produce sound.
2. To close the trachea during swallowing to pre-

vent food and saliva from entering the airway.

The wall of the larynx  is made up of the thyroid 
and cricoid hyaline cartilage and the elastic cartilage 
core of the epiglottis extending over the lumen of 
the larynx (Figure 13-4).

Extrinsic laryngeal muscles attach the larynx to 
the hyoid bone to raise the larynx during swallowing. 
Intrinsic laryngeal muscles (abductor, adductors, 
and tensors), innervated by the recurrent laryngeal 
nerve, link the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. When 
intrinsic muscles contract, the tension on the vocal 
cords changes to modulate phonation. The middle 
and lower laryngeal arteries (derived from the supe-
rior and inferior thyroid artery) supply the larynx. 
Lymphatic plexuses drain to the upper cervical lymph 
nodes and to the nodes along the trachea. 

The larynx can be subdivided into three regions: 
1. The supraglottis, which includes the epiglottis, 
false vocal cords (or folds), and laryngeal ventricles. 
2. The glottis, consisting of the true vocal cords (or 
folds) and the anterior and posterior commissures. 
3. The subglottis, the region below the true vocal 
cords,  extending  down  to  the  lower  border  of  the 
cricoid cartilage.

Upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses 
and  bacteria  usually  involve  the  supraglottis  and 
glottis regions. Hoarseness and transient voice loss 
are typical symptoms. 

During  forced  inspiration,  vocal  cords  are  ab-
ducted, and the space between the vocal cords widens. 
During phonation, the vocal cords are adducted 
and the space between the vocal cords changes into a 
linear slit. The vibration of the free edges of the cords 
during passage of air between them produces sound. 
The contraction of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, 
forming the body of the cords, increases tension on 
the vocal cords, changing the pitch of the produced 
sound (see Box 13-B).

The mucosa of the larynx is continuous with that 
of the pharynx and the trachea. A stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium  covers  the  lingual  surface  and  a  small 
extension of the pharyngeal surface of the epiglottis 
and the true vocal cords. Elsewhere, the epithelium 
is pseudostratiﬁed ciliated, with goblet cells.

Laryngeal seromucous glands are found through-
out the lamina propria, except at the level of the true 
vocal  cords. The  lamina  propria  of  the  true  vocal 
cords consists of three layers (see Figure 13-4): 

1.  A  superficial  layer  containing  extracellular 
matrix and few elastic ﬁbers. This layer is known as 
Reinke’s space.

2. An intermediate layer with elastic ﬁbers.

    Odorant-OBP complex binding to type 1 
receptor (TR1) activates G(cid:95) protein coupled to the

protein–activated adenylyl cyclase 3 catalyzes the

cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which 
opens CNG channels to facilitate the influx of Na+ 
and Ca2+.  Ca2+ activates the efflux of Cl–.  An

 Box 13-B | True vocal cords or folds

•  The true vocal cords or folds consist of two regions, the cover and the 
core, with different structural properties.
•  The cover consists of stratiﬁed squamous epithelium and the superﬁcial layer 
of the lamina propria (Reinke’s space). The core is composed of the intermedi-
ate and deep layers of the lamina propria (representing the vocal ligament) and 
the vocalis or thyroarytenoid muscle.
    The cover is ﬂexible, whereas the core is stiff and has contractile properties 
allowing adjustment of stiffness.
•  During phonation, the cover of the vocal cords displays horizontal move-
ments and vertical undulation (known as mucosal wave). Changes in the stiff-
ness in the core of the vocal cords modify the mucosal wave. As the stiffness 
of the cord increases, the velocity of the mucosal wave increases and the pitch 
rises.

3. A deep layer with abundant elastic and collagen 

ﬁbers. 

The  intermediate  and  deep  layer  of  the  lamina 
propria constitute the vocal ligament. Reinke’s space 
and the epithelial covering are responsible for vocal 
cord vibration. 

Reinke’s  edema  results  when  viral  infection  or 
severe coughing spells cause ﬂuid to accumulate in 
the superﬁcial layer of the lamina propria. 

Singer’s nodules are small ﬁbrosis clusters in the 
lamina  propria  covered  by  epithelium,  where  the 
margins of the true vocal cords contact each other.

The lamina propria is usually rich in mast cells. 
Mast  cells  participate  in  hypersensitivity  reactions 
leading to edema and laryngeal obstruction, a po-
tential medical emergency. 

Croup  designates  a  laryngotracheobronchitis  in 
children, in which an inﬂammatory process narrows 
the airway and produces inspiratory stridor.

 Box 13-C | Airway mucus: Highlights to remember

•  Airway mucus traps inhaled particles and transports them out of the lungs by 
ciliary beating and cough. Excessive mucus or deﬁcient clearance are charac-
teristics of all common airway diseases.
•  Airway mucus is produced by three secretory cell types: (1) Goblet cells; (2) 
mucous and serous cells of the submucosal glands; and (3) Clara cells of the 
terminal bronchioles. 
•  Mucus contains: (1) Mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B; (2) antimicrobial 
molecules (defensins, lysozyme, and immunoglobulin A); (3) immunomodula-
tory molecules (secretoglobin and cytokines); and (4) protective molecules 
(trefoil proteins and heregulin).
•  Normal airway mucus is 97% water and 3% solids (mucins, non-mucin pro-
teins, salts, lipids, and cellular debris). The hydration of the mucus determines 
its viscosity and elastic properties, two essential characteristics for normal 
clearance of mucus by ciliary action and cough.
•  Airway mucus consists of two layers: (1) A periciliary layer; and (2) a mucus 
gel layer atop the periciliary layer. Polymeric MUC5AC and MUC5B are con-
tinuously synthesized and secreted to replenish the mucus gel layer cleared 
by ciliary beating to eliminate inhaled particles, pathogens, and dissolved 
chemicals that might damage the lungs.

Trachea
The trachea, the major segment of the conducting 
region of the respiratory system, is the continuation 
of the larynx. 

At the tracheal carina, the trachea branches into 
the right and left primary bronchi entering the hi-
lum of each lung. The hilum is the region where the 
primary  bronchus,  pulmonary  artery,  pulmonary 
vein, nerves, and lymphatics enter and leave the lung. 
Secondary divisions of the bronchi and accompanying 
connective tissue septa divide each lung into lobes. 
The right lung has three lobes, whereas the left 

lung has two lobes. 

Subsequent bronchial divisions further subdivide 
each  lobe  into  bronchopulmonary  segments.  The 
bronchopulmonary segment is the gross anatomic 
unit  of  the  lung  that  can  be  resected  surgically. 
Successive bronchial branching gives rise to several 
generations of bronchopulmonary subsegments.

The trachea and main bronchi are lined by pseu-
dostratiﬁed columnar ciliated epithelium resting on 
a distinct basal lamina. Several types of cells can be 
identiﬁed (Figure 13-5): 

1.  Columnar  ciliated  cells  are  the  predominant 
cell  population,  extending  from  the  lumen  to  the 
basal lamina. 

2. Goblet cells are abundant nonciliated cells, also 
in contact with the lumen and the basal lamina. They 
produce mucin polymers MUC5AC and MUC5B 
(see Figure 13-5). 

3. Basal cells rest on the basal lamina but do not 

extend to the lumen. 

4. Cells of Kulchitsky are neuroendocrine cells also 
resting on the basal lamina and are predominantly 
found at the bifurcation of lobar bronchi. They give 
rise to small cell lung cancer (SCLC; also called oat-
cell carcinoma). These cells secrete peptide hormones  
such as serotonin, calcitonin, antidiuretic hormone 
(ADH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
The  lamina  propria  contains  elastic  ﬁbers. The 
submucosa displays mucous and serous glands that, 
together with goblet cells, produce components of 
the airways mucus (see Box 13-C). 

The framework of the trachea and extrapulmonary 
bronchi consists of a stack of C-shaped hyaline carti-
lages, each surrounded by a ﬁbroelastic layer blending 
with the perichondrium. 

In  the  trachea  and  primary  bronchi,  the  open 
ends  of  the  cartilage  rings  point  posteriorly  to  the 
esophagus. The lowest tracheal cartilage is the carinal 
cartilage. Transverse ﬁbers of the trachealis muscle 
attach to the inner ends of the cartilage. In branching 
bronchi, cartilage rings (see Figure 13-5) are replaced 
by irregularly shaped cartilage plates (Figure 13-6), 
surrounded  by  smooth  muscle  bundles  in  a  spiral 
arrangement.

Segmentation of the bronchial tree
Within  the  pulmonary  parenchyma,  a  segmental 
bronchus gives rise to large and small subsegmental 
bronchi. A small subsegmental bronchus is continu-
ous with a bronchiole. 

This transition involves the loss of cartilage plates 
in the bronchiole and a progressive increase in the 
number of elastic ﬁbers.

The intrapulmonary segmentation results in the 

organization of a pulmonary lobule and a pulmonary 
acinus (Figure 13-7; see also Figure 13-6). 

Pulmonary lobule and pulmonary acinus
A terminal bronchiole and the associated region of 
pulmonary tissues that it supplies constitute a pul-
monary lobule (Figure 13-8). A pulmonary lobule 
includes the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, 
alveolar sacs, and alveoli.

Bronchial endocrine cells (of Kulchitsky; not shown)
Neuroendocrine cells with small granules can be observed in the basal 
region of the epithelium. They are predominant at the bifurcation of the lobar 
bronchi. 
   They are members of the diffuse endocrine system (previously known as 
APUD, or amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system). 
   These cells resemble the enteroendocrine cells found in the digestive 
system.  They may synthesize antidiuretic hormone, serotonin, calcitonin, 
somatostatin, and other small peptides of defined pharmacologic action.      
   Bronchial endocrine cells give rise to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), that 
displays endobronchial growth and metastasizes rapidly to regional lymph 
nodes.

Composition and function of airway mucus

Airway mucus traps pathogens, particles, and toxic chemicals in 
inhaled air. It is an extracellular gel containing water and glycoproteins 
(mucins) produced by goblet cells, submucosal glands, and club 
(Clara) cells. Airways mucus consists of two layers: (1) a pericilliary 
layer, and (2) a mucus gel layer. MUC5AC and MUC5B are 
cross-linking glycoprotein monomers binding large amounts of fluid, 
which allows mucus to act as lubricant and maintain its viscous and 
elastic properties. Low viscosity and elasticity determine effective 
mucus clearance by cilia beating velocity and cough. MUC5AC is 
produced by goblet cells and MUC5B is secreted by goblet cells and 
submucosal glands (not shown in the diagram).

Small bronchi

1
A distinguishing feature between trachea and bronchi is 
the replacement of hyaline cartilage rings by irregularly 
shaped cartilaginous plates in bronchi. Large bronchi are 
encircled by the plates, but smaller bronchi have small 
plates. 
    The lining epithelium is pseudostratified columnar 
ciliated with mucus-secreting goblet cells. The lamina 
propria contains a layer of circularly arranged but 
discontinuous smooth muscle, and seromucous glands 
connected by excretory ducts to the epithelial surface. 

Smooth muscle bundles
Contraction of the smooth muscle decreases the lumen 
of the bronchus. Stimulation of the parasympathetic 
nervous system (vagus nerve) produces contraction of 
the smooth muscle. Stimulation of the sympathetic 
nervous system inhibits contraction of the smooth 
muscle. 

2

Bronchioles 

 As bronchioles reduce their diameter, the 
pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium decreases 
in height to finally become simple columnar-to-cuboidal 
ciliated at the terminal bronchioles.  
   Bronchioles lack cartilage and submucosal glands, but 
a few goblet cells may be found in the initial portions.The 
lamina propria is composed of smooth muscle and 
elastic and collagenous fibers.

the wall of a branch of the pulmonary artery 
(tunica interna and adventitia).
  Note that the elastic fibers surround 
residual smooth muscle fibers.
  The lining epithelium of the terminal 
bronchiole contains club cells (Clara cells) 
difficult to resolve at low magnification.

Pores of Kohn
The alveolar pores of Kohn connect 
adjacent alveoli. The pores are 
responsible for collateral respiration 
when blockage of a small bronchiole 

occurs. Thus, in case of a blockage, 
adjacent unobstructed bronchioles 
and associated alveoli continue to 
provide alveolar ventilation through 
the pores of Kohn.

The pulmonary acinus, the unit of gas exchange 
of the lung, is supplied by a respiratory bronchiole. 
Therefore,  respiratory  acini  are  subcomponents  of 
a respiratory lobule. In contrast to the acinus, the 
pulmonary lobule includes the terminal bronchiole. 
The pulmonary lobule–pulmonary acinus con-
cept  is  important  for  understanding  the  types  of 
emphysema. Emphysema is permanent enlargement 
of the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, 
associated with the destruction of their walls.

Distal to the respiratory bronchiole is the alveolar 
duct. The  respiratory  bronchiole  and  the  initial 
portion of the alveolar duct are characterized by an 
interrupted wall with typical smooth muscle knobs 
and associated scattered elastic ﬁbers bulging into 
the lumen (Figure 13-9). 

At the distal end of the alveolar duct, the smooth 

muscle knobs disappear and the lining epithelium 
is primarily type I alveolar epithelial cells. Alveolar 
ducts  branch  to  form  two  or  more  alveolar  sacs. 
Alveolar sacs are formed by the alveoli, the terminal 
part of the airway.

Pathology: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD) 
is characterized by progressive and often irreversible 
airﬂow limitations. COPD includes chronic bron-
chitis and emphysema. 

Chronic bronchitis develops in smokers and in re-
sponse to inhalation of toxic fumes and long-standing 
exposure to high levels of air pollutants.  It is charac-
terized by hyperplasia and long-term hypersecretion 
of the seromucous glands causing airways obstruc-
tion and mucus plugging. As a result, a reduction in

individuals with 
(cid:95)1-antitrypsin deficiency.

alveolar ventilation leads to hypoxemia (low levels of 
oxygen in blood) and hypercapnia (increased level of 
carbon dioxide in blood). 

Hypoxemia  can  cause  secondary  pulmonary 
hypertension  and  eventual  right  heart  failure  (cor 
pulmonale). Hypercapnia results in cyanosis (Greek 
kyanos, a dark blue substance) but no signiﬁcant dys-
pnea (Greek, dys, difﬁcult; pnoe, breathing). Cyanosis 
is a bluish color to the skin or mucosae membranes 
usually caused by a reduction of oxygen in the blood. 
COPD occurs in the small-airways, the bronchi-
oles, and in lung parenchyma. You have seen that 
elastic  ﬁbers  are  important  components  of  bron-
chioles  and  alveolar  walls.  A  loss  of  elasticity  and 
breakdown of elastic ﬁbers give rise to emphysema, 
characterized  by  chronic  airﬂow  obstruction.  As  a 
result,  adjacent  alveoli  become  conﬂuent,  creating 
large air spaces, or blebs (Figure 13-10). 

Terminal and respiratory bronchioles are also af-
fected by the loss of elastic tissue. As a result of the 
loss of elastic ﬁbers, the small airways tend to collapse 
during expiration, leading to chronic airﬂow obstruc-
tion and secondary infections. 

Let us review the concepts of the pulmonary lobule 
and the acinus to understand the types of emphysema. 
Figures 13-6 and 13-8 show that a pulmonary lobule 
includes  the  terminal  bronchiole  and  the  ﬁrst  to 
third generations of derived respiratory bronchioles. 
Each respiratory bronchiole gives rise to alveolar ducts 
and alveoli, an arrangement known as the acinus, so 
called because aggregates of alveoli cluster like acini in 
connection with the ductlike respiratory bronchiole. 
Because a pulmonary lobule generates several respi-
ratory  bronchioles,  each  resolved  into  an  acinus,  a 
pulmonary lobule is made up of several acini.

Pathogenesis of emphysema

A stimulus (for example, smoking) increases the number of macrophages, 
which secrete chemoattractants for neutrophils. Neutrophils accumulate  
in the alveolar lumen and interstitium.
        Neutrophils release elastase into the alveolar lumen.

nates when the respiratory bronchioles are affected. 
The more distal alveolar duct and alveoli are intact. 
Thus, emphysematous and normal air spaces coexist 
within the same lobule and acini.  

In panacinar (or panlobular) emphysema, blebs 
are observed from the respiratory bronchiole down 
to the alveolar sacs. This type of emphysema is more 
common  in  patients  with  a  deﬁciency  in  the  (cid:95)1-
antitrypsin gene encoding a serum protein. 

Protein  (cid:95)1-antitrypsin  is  a  major  inhibitor  of 
proteases,  in particular elastase, secreted by neutro-
phils  during  inﬂammation  (Figure  13-11).  Under 
the inﬂuence of a stimulus, such as cigarette smoke, 
macrophages  in  the  alveolar  wall  and  alveolar  lu-
men secrete proteases and chemoattractants (mainly 
leukotriene B4) to recruit neutrophils.

Chemoattracted neutrophils appear in the alveolar 
lumen and wall and release elastase, normally neutral-
ized by (cid:95)1-antitrypsin. Chronic smokers have low 
serum levels of (cid:95)1-antitrypsin, and elastase continues 
the unopposed destruction of elastic ﬁbers present in 
the alveolar wall. This process develops in 10% to 
15% of smokers and leads to emphysema.

Asthma is a chronic inﬂammatory process char-
acterized by the reversible narrowing of the airways 
(bronchoconstriction) in response to various stim-
uli. The classic symptoms of asthma are wheezing, 
cough, and shortness of breath (dyspnea). 

Emphysema differs from asthma in that the ab-
normalities  limiting  airﬂow  are  irreversible  and  a 
destructive process targets the lung parenchyma.

Pathology: Asthma
Asthma consists in airway hyperresponsiveness, de-
ﬁned by three salient features (Figure 13-12):

1.  Airway  wall  inﬂammation,  involving  neutro-
phils, T cells (CD8+), alveolar dendritic cells, and 
macrophages.  Asthma  is  characterized  by  the  re-
cruitment of T cells (CD4+) by dendritic cells in the 
alveolar air spaces, and of eosinophils in bronchioles 
(see Figure 13-12).

2. Luminal obstruction of airways by mucus, caused 
by hypersecretion of bronchial mucous glands, along 
with inﬁltration by inﬂammatory cells.

3. Vasodilation of the bronchial microvasculature 

with increased vascular permeability and edema.

Asthma can be triggered by repeated antigen expo-
sure (allergic asthma) or by an abnormal autonomic 
neural  regulation  of  airway  function  (nonallergic 
asthma).

The pathophysiologic aspects of asthma appear to 
result from the aberrant proliferation of CD4+ helper 
TH2 cells producing three cytokines: interleukin (IL)-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 stimulates immature T cells to 
develop into the TH2 cell type, which produces IL-13 
to precipitate an asthma attack. 

Club cells (Clara cells)

Club cells, formerly called Clara cells, are epithelial 
cells with a dome-shaped apical domain lacking cilia. 
They represent 80% of the epithelial cell population 
of  the  terminal  bronchiole  (Figure  13-13). Their 
function is to protect the bronchiolar epithelium.

Figure 13-13. Structure and function of club cells

Club cells (Clara cells)

Nonciliated club cells coexist in terminal bronchioles with a single layer of ciliated 
cuboidal cells.  After airway injury, club cells can proliferate to regenerate the bronchiolar 
epithelium and even migrate to replenish alveolar epithelial cells. This process is known as 
alveolar bronchiolization. 
   Club cells produce: (1) Surfactant proteins  SP-A and SP-D, coating the surface of the 
bronchiolar epithelium and presumably also regulating the transport of chloride ions.      
(2) Mucin MUC5AC and MUC5B monomers, present as polymers in the airway mucus.   
(3) Anti-inflammatory club cell secretory protein (CCSP), involved in protecting airway 
homeostasis against injury or infection. 
  At the electron microscope level, the apical dome-shaped region of club cells contains 
cytoplasmic dense secretory granules, mitochondria, and numerous vesicles.

Histopathology from Weidner N, Cote RJ, Suster S, Weiss LM: Modern Surgical Pathology, St. Louis, Saunders, 2003.

The histologic pattern of obliterative bronchiolitis of a 
terminal bronchiole is compatible with abnormal 
tissue repair and inflammation in response to tissue 
injury, including deficient epithelial regeneration, 
peribronchiolar fibroproliferation, and  chronic 
inflammatory cell infiltrate.
   Club cells, which can regenerate the bronchiolar 
epithelium, are reduced in number or absent. 
   Obliterative bronchiolitis is a frequent complication 
of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or lung 
transplantation.

when ATP is bound and the regulatory

– .

In normal individuals: Epithelial cells lining 
the airways display two types of channels: 
       The CFTR channel releases Cl–  
3
       The other channel takes up Na+.  Water 
4
follows the movement of Cl– by osmosis. 
    This mechanism maintains the mucus 
made by goblet cells and mucus-secreting 
glands to remain wet and less viscous.

In patients with cystic fibrosis: 
       A defective or absent CFTR channel 
5
prevents Cl– movement                    
       The cell  takes up extra Na+  
6
    Reduced Cl– secretion and increased 
Na+ absorption results in insufficient fluid 
in the mucus. The mucus, containing 
entangled mucin polymers, becomes thick 
and traps bacteria and neutrophils. Cell 
destruction occurs.

Following airway injury, club cells proliferate and 
migrate  to  replenish  alveolar  epithelial  cells. This 
process  is  known  as  alveolar  bronchiolization.  In 
addition, proliferative club cells can produce ciliated 
cells and additional club cells.

Club cells produce: 
1. Surfactant proteins  SP-A and SP-D, coating 
the surface of the bronchiolar epithelium and also 
regulating  the  transport  of  chloride  ions  across  a 
cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
channel. Chloride transport is controlled by a cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)–guanylyl cyclase 
C mechanism.      

2.  Mucin  MUC5AC  and  MUC5B  monomers, 

present as polymers in the airway mucus.

3. Anti-inﬂammatory club cell secretory protein 
(CCSP or secretoglobin family 1A member 1 [Sc-
gb1a1]), a member of the secretoglobin gene family, 
is involved in the protection of the airway epithelium 
against chronic injury or infection. Chronic injury 
to the airway inhibits normal epithelial repair and 
differentiation and is characterized by a decline in 
the number of club cells and in the levels of CCSP 
in lungs and serum.

Obliterative  bronchiolitis  (OB)  or  constrictive 
bronchiolitis is characterized by progressive airﬂow 
obstruction. OB, attributed to a defective function of 
club cells, shows signiﬁcant peribronchiolar inﬂam-

mation and obstructive ﬁbrosis, causing a reduction in 
the diameter  of the terminal bronchioles (see Figure 
13-13).  OB  affects  most  hematopoietic  stem-cell 
transplantation or lung transplant recipients. Bone 
marrow  stem  cells  administered  to  experimental 
animals by transtracheal delivery can express CCSP, 
cytokeratins, and chloride channels in the lung.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Cystic ﬁbrosis
Cystic ﬁbrosis is a recessive genetic disease affecting 
children and young adults. Cystic ﬁbrosis is caused 
by  mutations  in  the  gene  encoding  cystic  ﬁbrosis 
transmembrane  conductance  regulator  (CFTR), 
which results in reduced chloride secretion, increased 
sodium absorption, and insufﬁcient airway luminal 
ﬂuid (see Box 13-D and Figure 13-14).

These alterations in the respiratory and gastroin-

testinal tracts result in: 

1. Deﬁcient mucus clearance, which determines a 
chronic cycle of infection, inﬂammation, and injury.
2. The formation of a mucus gel matrix with re-
duced pore size, which consists of highly entangled 
polymeric MUC5AC and MUC5B molecules inﬁl-
trated with pathogens and immobilized neutrophils 
that might otherwise clear the infection.

Respiratory  disease  results  from  the  obstruction 
of  the  pulmonary  airways  by  thick  mucus  plugs, 
followed  by  bacterial  infections.  Cough,  chronic

       Several alveolar ducts result from the division of a single bronchiole. The wall of an 
4
alveolar sac consists of alveolar openings. Remnants of the muscle knobs lined by a low 
cuboidal-to-squamous simple epithelium can be seen at the alveolar openings.
       An alveolar sac is continuous with a cluster of alveoli sharing a wider space called the

The lung is a gas-exchanging organ for the provision of O2 to the blood 
and removal of CO2 from the blood. Alveolar capillaries are closely 
apposed to the alveolar lumen. 
    Gas exchange by passive diffusion occurs across the air-blood 
barrier consisting of (1) cytoplasmic extensions  of type I alveolar 
cells; (2) a dual basal lamina, synthesized by type I alveolar cells and 

endothelial cells; (3) cytoplasmic extensions of continuous endothelial 
cells; and (4) the plasma membrane of red blood cells. 
    Type II alveolar cells contribute indirectly to the gas-exchange 
process by secreting surfactant, a lipid-protein complex that reduces 
the surface tension of the alveolus and prevents alveolar collapsing.

Clinical significance: Alveolar gas exchange and acid-base balance

Changes in partial pressure of CO2 (designated PCO2) 
caused by inadequate ventilation leads to acid-base 
balance disturbances and, consequently, to an alteration in 
blood pH. 
    An increase in PCO2 decreases blood pH; a decrease of 

PCO2 increases pH.  An increase in ventilation decreases 
PCO2. PCO2 increases as ventilation decreases.  
    Both blood pH and PCO2 are critical regulators of the 
ventilation rate sensed by chemoreceptors, located in the 
brain (medulla) and carotid and aortic bodies.

purulent  secretions,  increased  numbers  of  mucin-
secreting cells in the submucosal glands, and dyspnea 
are typical symptoms of this COPD. These events 
are  manifested  radiographically  as  bronchiectasis 
(localized widening of bronchi).

 Box 13-D | Cystic ﬁbrosis gene

The cystic ﬁbrosis gene encodes the protein CFTR, belonging to the ABC trans-
porter family, so called because it contains adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding 
domains, or ATP-binding cassettes, and requires ATP hydrolysis to transport ions, 
sugars, and amino acids. In 70% of patients with cystic ﬁbrosis, the amino acid 
508, of a total of 1480 amino acids in CFTR protein, is missing.

As a member of the ABC transporter family, CFTR is rather unusual because 
it appears to require  both ATP hydrolysis and cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP)–dependent phosphorylation to function as a Cl– channel. 

Inherited mutations of CFTR in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis result in defective 
chloride transport and increased sodium absorption. The CFTR channel also 
transports bicarbonate ions. Inherited mutations of CFTR are associated with re-
duced bicarbonate transport, resulting in excessive mucin cross-linking by calcium. 

In most patients, the blockage of pancreatic ducts 
by mucus causes pancreatic dysfunction. Pancreatic 
ductules release a bicarbonate-rich ﬂuid under regu-
lation of secretin. Secretin is produced by enteroen-
docrine  cells  in  response  to  acidic  gastric  contents 
entering the duodenum (see Chapter 17, Digestive 
Glands). In the skin, the excessive presence of salt 
secretion by sweat glands is diagnostic of cystic ﬁbrosis 
(see Chapter 11, Integumentary System).

Treatment of the disease consists of physical therapy 
to facilitate bronchial drainage, antibiotic treatment 
of infections, and pancreatic enzyme replacement.

Respiratory portion of the lung
Terminal bronchioles give rise to three generations of 
respiratory bronchioles (0.5 to 0.2 mm in diameter). 
Respiratory bronchioles are the transition from 
the  conducting  to  the  respiratory  portion  of  the 
lung (Figure 13-15).

basal lamina of the alveolar epithelium, where the 
alveolar capillary is closely associated with the 
alveolar wall (the favorable site for gas exchange).
    In some other places, connective tissue elements 
surround the alveolar capillary. At this site, fluids can 
move from capillaries to the interstitium, to drain 
eventually into para-alveolar lymphatics present in 
the arteriolar wall, branches of the pulmonary or 
bronchial arteries. Lymphatic vessels are rarely 
found in the interalveolar septa.

Alveolar macrophages are sentinel cells migrating over the luminal 
surface of the alveolus. These cells monitor any inhaled dust or bacteria 
that may have escaped entrapment by the mucous lining in the airway.  
    When stimulated by metabolic products of bacteria, macrophages 
release chemotactic factors  that induce transendothelial migration of 
leukocytes, which join macrophages to neutralize invading 
microorganisms. Alveolar dendritic cells scan and take up antigens 

from the alveolar air space for presentation to T cells.
    In patients with heart disease, alveolar macrophages contain many 
vacuoles filled with hemosiderin, resulting from phagocytosis of red 
blood cells and degradation of their hemoglobin. 
    Alveolar macrophages migrate from the alveoli to the surface of the 
bronchi and are transported by ciliary action to the upper airway to the 
pharynx where they are swallowed with the saliva.

They are lined initially by simple cuboidal epithe-
lial cells. The epithelium becomes low cuboidal and 
nonciliated in subsequent branches. 

The  respiratory  bronchiole  subdivides  to  give 
rise to an alveolar duct that is continuous with the 
alveolar sac. Several alveoli open into an alveolar sac.

The alveolus
About 300 million air sacs, or alveoli, in each lung 
provide a total surface area of 75 m2   for oxygen and 
carbon dioxide exchange. 

Each alveolus has a thin wall with capillaries lined 
by simple squamous epithelial cells (Figure 13-16)

The pulmonary surfactant is synthesized by type II alveolar cells 
and stored in lamellar bodies until its release. Club cells also 
produce surfactant but of different composition.
    The surfactant contains three major components: phospholipid 
DPPC, cholesterol, and surfactant proteins (SPs). SP-A and 
SP-B combine with DPPC within the lamellar bodies. In the 
alveolar space, SP-B and SP-C stabilize the surfactant coat. 

forming part of the air-blood barrier (Figure 13-17). 
The alveolar epithelium consists of two cell types 

(see Figures 13-16 and 13-17): 

1. Type I alveolar cells, representing about 40% 
of the epithelial cell population but lining 90% of 
the alveolar surface.  

2. Type II alveolar cells, approximately 60% of the 
cells, covering only 10% of the alveolar surface area.   
Each alveolus opens into an alveolar sac. However, 
a  few  of  them  open  directly  into  the  respiratory 
bronchiole (see Figure 13-15). This particular feature 
distinguishes the respiratory bronchiole from the 
terminal bronchiole, whose wall is not associated 
with alveolar outpocketings.

The  low  cuboidal  epithelium  of  the  respiratory 
bronchiole is continuous with the squamous type I 
alveolar cells of the alveolus (see Figure 13-9).

Additional cells of the alveolar septa are:
1. The alveolar macrophages (Figure 13-18), also 
called  dust  cells. They  derive  from  bone-marrow 
monocytes  and  are  frequently  seen  in  the  alveolar 
lumen and interstitium. 

2.  Alveolar  dendritic  cells,  actively  monitor  for 
antigens the alveolar air space and take them up for 
presentation to T cells. Dendritic processes extend 
into the surfactant layer (see Figure 13-18).

Alveolar capillaries are lined by continuous endo-
thelial cells juxtaposed to type I alveolar cells through 
a dual basal lamina produced by these two cells.

Lymphatic vessels are rarely present in the inter-
alveolar space. Instead, they are observed associated 
to the wall of the arterioles and branches from the 
pulmonary  artery  and  bronchial  artery.    Multiple 
small  perivascular  lymphatics  are  responsible  for 
maintaining ﬂuid balance in the alveolar interstitium.
Alveolar  endothelial  cells  contain  angiotensin-
converting  enzyme  (ACE)  for  the  conversion  of 
angiotensin I (ANG I) to angiotensin II (ANG II)
(see Figure 14-19 in Chapter 14, Urinary System).

Type II alveolar cells

Alveolar macrophages remove

degradation is by oxidation of 
polyunsaturated phospholipids 
associated with DPPC. The oxidation 
process is triggered by air pollutants.
   Asbetosis is an interstitial 
pulmonary fibrosis caused by inhaled 
asbestos dust. An excess of asbestos  
(composed of silica, iron, sodium, 
magnesium and other metals) causes  
macrophages to release chemical 
agents producing alveolitis and 
eventual fibrosis of the lung. The 
alveolar spaces are not affected.

Asbestos bodies and 
macrophages in the 

alveolar lumen

alveolar cells are polygonal-shaped, vacuolated and 
bulge beyond the level of the surrounding epithelium.
The free surface of type II alveolar cells is covered 
by  short  microvilli. The  cytoplasm  displays  dense 
membrane-bound  lamellar  bodies,  representing 
secretory granules containing pulmonary surfactant 
(Figure 13-19).

Surfactant  is  released  by  exocytosis  and  spreads  
over  a  thin  layer  of  ﬂuid  that  normally  coats  the 
alveolar surface. By this mechanism, the pulmonary 
surfactant lowers the surface tension at the air-ﬂuid 
interface and thus reduces the tendency of the alveo-
lus to collapse at the end of expiration.  As previously 
indicated, club cells, located in terminal bronchioles, 
also secrete pulmonary surfactant. 

The  pulmonary  surfactant  contains  (see  Figure 

13-19):

1. Phospholipids.
2. Cholesterol.
3. Proteins.   
Speciﬁc surfactant proteins (SPs) consist of one 
hydrophilic glycoprotein (SP-A) and two hydropho-
bic proteins (SP-B and SP-C). 

Within the lamellar bodies, SP-A and SP-B trans-
form  the  phospholipid  dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-
choline (DPPC) into a mature surfactant molecule. 
In  the  alveolar  space,  SP-B  and  SP-C  stabilize 
the phospholipid layer and enhance the surfactant 
action of the phospholipid DPPC–protein complex 
(Figure 13-20). 

Surfactant turnover is facilitated by the phagocytic 

function of alveolar macrophages (see Figures 13-18 
and 13-20). 

Macrophages  can  also  take  up  inhaled  asbestos 
and trigger interstitial pulmonary ﬁbrosis, asbesto-
sis, characterized by extensive deposition of collagen 
and asbestos bodies (asbestos ﬁbers coated by iron 
particles, see Figure 13-20). 

The alveolar spaces may be involved and type II 
alveolar  cells  increase  in  number  (hyperplasia).  An 
additional  function  of  type  II  alveolar  cells  is  the 
maintenance and repair of the alveolar epithelium 
when injury occurs. 

When  type  I  alveolar  cells  are  damaged,  type  II 
alveolar cells increase in number and differentiate into 
type I alveolar-like cells (see Figure 13-20). 

As already discussed, club cells also have a reparative 
function during injury of the bronchiolar and alveolar 
epithelium (alveolar bronchiolization).

Pathology: Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
The signiﬁcance of the cell components of the alveolus 
becomes clear when we analyze the relevant aspects 
of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
ARDS  results  from  a  disruption  of  the  normal 
barrier that prevents leakage of ﬂuid of the alveolar 
capillaries into the interstitium and alveolar spaces.  

Two mechanisms can alter the alveolar barrier:
1. An increase in hydrostatic pressure in the al-
veolar capillaries, caused, for example, by failure of 
the left ventricle or stenosis of the mitral valve, This 
determines increased ﬂuid and proteins in the alveolar

         Neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes 
and, together with endotoxin, damage the 
endothelial cells. Macrophages are activated 
by inflammatory cytokines and contribute to 
the endothelial cell damage. 

3

         The alveolar-capillary barrier becomes 
permeable and cells and fluid enter the 
interstitium and alveolar space.

Edema, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and 
fibrin deposition result from an increase in 
pulmnary microvascular permeability to 
plasma proteins. Hyaline membranes, 
eosinophilic deposits lining the alveoli, 
develop. Remnants of hyaline membranes 
can remain in the alveolar septa.

        Following the endothelial cell injury, type I

alveolar cells die, denuding the alveolar side 
of the barrier.  Neutrophils and macrophages 
are seen in the alveolar lumen and 
interstitium.

        A repair process can restore normal

alveolar cells proliferate, reestablish the 
production of surfactant, and differentiate 
into type I alveolar cells.

        If the initial damage is severe, interstitial 
fibroblasts proliferate, progressive interstitial 
and intra-alveolar fibrosis develops, and gas 
exchange is seriously affected.

   Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

A dysfunction of the left ventricle is the main 
cause of this type of pulmonary edema.            
    Pulmonary capillaries are dilated and an 
increase in hydrostatic pressure leads to 
interstitial and alveolar edema. Abundant 
leukocytes and red blood cells and protein-rich 
fluid are visualized in the lumen of dilated alveoli.

spaces. The resulting edema is called cardiogenic or 
hydrostatic pulmonary edema. 

2. The  hydrostatic  pressure  is  normal,  but  the 
endothelial lining of the alveolar capillaries or the 
epithelial lining of the alveoli is damaged. Inhala-
tion of agents such as smoke, water (near drowning), 
or  bacterial  endotoxins  (resulting  from  sepsis),  or 
trauma can cause a defect in permeability. A cardiac 
component may or may not be involved.  Although 
the resulting edema is called noncardiogenic, it can 
coexist with a cardiogenic condition.

A common pathologic pattern of diffuse alveolar 
damage (Figure 13-21) can be observed in cardiogenic 
and noncardiogenic ARDS. 

The  ﬁrst  phase  of  ARDS  is  an  acute  exudative 
process deﬁned by interstitial and alveolar edema, 
neutrophil  inﬁltration,  hemorrhage,  and  deposits 
of ﬁbrin. Cellular debris, resulting from dead type I 
alveolar cells, and ﬁbrin deposit in the alveolar space 
and form hyaline membranes. 

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in 
premature infants is characterized by a protein-rich, 

ﬁbrin-rich exudation into the alveolar space, form-
ing a hyaline membrane that leads to CO2 retention 
(Figure 13-22). In the newborn, surfactant deﬁciency 
causes the lungs to collapse (atelectatic lung) with 
each successive breath.   

The  second  phase  is  a  proliferative  process  in 
which  alveolar  cells  proliferate  and  differentiate  to 
restore  the  epithelial  alveolar  lining,  returning  gas 
exchange to normal in most cases. In other cases, the 
interstitium  displays  inﬂammatory  cells  and  ﬁbro-
blasts. Fibroblasts proliferate and invade the alveolar 
spaces  through  gaps  of  the  basal  lamina.  Hyaline 
membranes are either removed by phagocytosis by 
macrophages or invaded by ﬁbroblasts.

The third phase is chronic ﬁbrosis and occlusion 
of blood vessels. Because ARDS is part of a systemic 
inﬂammatory  response,  the  outcome  of  the  lung 
process  depends  on  improvement  of  the  systemic 
condition. The prognosis for return to normal lung 
function is good. The diagnosis of ARDS is based 
on clinical (dyspnea, cyanosis, and tachypnea) and 
radiologic examination.

Surfactant deficiency

Surfactant is synthesized by type II alveolar cells after 
the 35th week of gestation. Corticosteroids induce 
the synthesis of surfactant in the fetus. High 
levels of insulin (diabetic mothers) can antagonize 
the effect of corticosteroids. Infants of diabetic 
mothers have a higher risk of developing hyaline 
membrane disease.
    Surfactant reduces surface tension within the 
alveoli. Less pressure is required to keep alveoli 
open. 
    Surfactant also maintains alveolar expansion by 
modulating surface tension with alveolar size.
In the newborn, surfactant deficiency causes the 
lungs to collapse (atelectatic lung) with each 
successive breath.  A lack of O2 impairs surfactant 
synthesis.
    Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in 
premature infants is characterized by a protein-rich, 
fibrin-rich exudation into the alveolar space, forming a 
hyaline membrane that leads to CO2 retention.

Treatment is focused on neutralizing the disorder 
causing ARDS and providing support of gas exchange 
until the condition improves.

Pathology: Lung cancer
Most lung tumors are malignant. They can be pri-
mary tumors, originated in the lung, or secondary 
or metastatic, spreading from other tumors. 

Local intrathoracic spread include:
1.  Invasion  of  the  cervical  sympathetic  chain, 
represented by the Horner’s syndrome, usually af-
fecting only one side of the face. The common signs 

and  symptoms  include  miosis  (persistently  small 
pupil), anisocoria (difference in pupil size between 
the  two  eyes),  reduced  or  delayed  dilation  of  the 
affected pupil in dim light, and ptosis (drooping of 
the upper eyelid).

2.  Invasion  of  the  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  and 

brachial plexus.

Hematogenous spreading to bones, central nervous 

system, and liver are the most common.     

Based on the type of cells, primary lung cancer can 

be classiﬁed into two major groups:

1. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC; also called oat-

Pulmonary artery

The pulmonary artery transports deoxygenated blood.
    It enters the lung with the main bronchi, branches 
following the bronchial tree, and terminates at the 
respiratory bronchiole where it gives rise to the alveolar 
capillary plexuses in the wall of the alveoli.
    The wall of the pulmonary artery is thinner, with elastic 
fibers but less smooth muscle than systemic arteries. The 
pulmonary arterial and venous system operates at 
relatively low pressure, about 25 mm Hg systolic and 
8 mm Hg diastolic. The systemic arterial systolic pressure 
is about 120 mm Hg.

Bronchial artery

Bronchial arteries, carrying oxygenated 
blood, also follow the bronchial tree and 
supply branches to the walls of the bronchi, 
arteries, veins, and connective tissue septa.
    Capillaries from the bronchial arteries 
anastomose with the pulmonary vein 
plexuses and bronchial veins (not shown). 

Respiratory bronchiole

Deep (pulmonary) lymphatic plexus

Found around bronchi and bronchioles, 
blood vessels, and septa of the alveolar 
sacs, the deep pulmonary plexus links to 
the superficial (pleural) lymphatic plexus 
and also drains into the hilum and into the 
main lymphatic vessels. Tha alveolar wall 
lacks lymphatic vessels.

Pulmonary vein

The pulmonary vein transports 
oxygenated blood back to the 
heart. It arises from venules 
draining the alveolar capillary 
plexuses and travels in the 
connective tissue septa.

Visceral pleura

Pleuritic chest pain: A symptom resulting from inflammation of the 
pleural surfaces. The pain originates in the parietal pleura, 
innervated by the intercostal nerves.
Pleural effusion: Abnormal accumulation of liquid in the pleural 
space. Large pleural effusion restricts pulmonary function because 
air spaces and pulmonary circulation are compressed.
Hydrothorax: Accumulation of water may be an early sign of 
congestive heart failure. It is also observed in cirrhosis, malignant 
disease, and pulmonary embolism.
Hemothorax: Direct hemorrhage into the pleural space resulting 
from trauma to the thorax (rib fracture or penetrating object).
Chylothorax: Accumulation of chyle, a lipid-rich liquid transported 
from intestinal lacteals to systemic veins in the thorax through the 
thoracic duct. Obstruction or disruption of the thoracic duct by 
mediastinal tumors are the most common cause of chylothorax.
Pneumothorax: Accumulation of air in the pleural space indicates 
disruption of the visceral or parietal pleura after tracheobronchial 
rupture or focal pulmonary destructive processes (e.g., AIDS).

Inflammation of the pleura, pleuresy, is often secondary to an inflammatory 
disease in the lungs. The differential diagnosis of reactive mesothelial 
hyperplasia includes malignant mesothelioma. The linear arrangement of the 
hyperplastic mesothelial lining, reflecting the mesothelial surface, differs with the 
invasion nature of malignant mesothelioma. The illustration shows a fibrinous 
exudate covering a reactive mesothelial hyperplastic layer of the visceral pleura. 
The submesothelial space depicts intense vascularization and fibrosis, indicators 
of a chronic inflammatory process of the pleura.

cell carcinoma). Although less frequent (about 15% 
of all lung cancers), SCLC is highly malignant and 
spreads  very  rapidly.  In  fact,  metastases  are  found 
when a diagnosis is made.

2. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most 

frequent tumor (about 85% of all lung cancers). 

The NSCLC group includes two major subtypes 

of tumors:

1. Squamous cell carcinoma, a tumor derived from 
the transformation of the respiratory epithelium into 
a squamous metaplastic epithelium.

alveolar  epithelium  (bronchioalveolar  carcinoma). 
Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung 
cancer in women who have never smoked. 

Molecular  screening  of  lung  cancer  samples  is 
widely used for determining lung-cancer types and 
subtypes,  estimating  prognosis,  and  predicting  the 
response to therapy. For example, translocations  of 
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, present 
in approximately 5% of NSCLC, and mutations in 
the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor (EGFR), observed in 10% to 15% of NSCLC, 
are common in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. 

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which target the intra-
cellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, have shown 
efﬁcacy in the treatment of advanced-stage NSCLC 
when compared to conventional chemotherapy. 

Pleura
The pleura consists of two layers: 

1. A visceral layer.
2. A parietal layer. 
The visceral layer is closely attached to the lung. 
It is lined by a simple squamous epithelium, called 
mesothelium, and consists of cells with apical micro-
villi resting on a basal lamina applied to a connective 
tissue rich in elastic ﬁbers (Figure 13-23). This con-
nective tissue is continuous with the interlobular and 
interlobar septa of the lung. The parietal layer is also 
lined by the mesothelium. 

The visceral layer seals the lung surface, preventing 
leakage of air into the thoracic cavity. The parietal 
layer  is  thicker  and  lines  the  inner  surface  of  the 
thoracic cavity. A very thin liquid ﬁlm in between 
the visceral and parietal layers permits the smooth 
gliding of one layer against the other.

Blood  vessels  to  the  visceral  pleura  derive  from 
pulmonary and bronchial blood vessels (see Figure 
13-23). The  vascular  supply  to  the  parietal  pleura 
derives from the systemic blood vessels. Branches of 
the phrenic and intercostal nerves are found in the 
parietal pleura; the visceral pleura receives branches 
of the vagus and sympathetic nerves supplying the 
bronchi.

Pathology: Disorders of the pleura
Under normal conditions, the visceral pleura glides 
smoothly on the parietal pleura during respiration. 
However, during an inﬂammatory process, charac-
teristic  friction  sounds  can  be  detected  during  the 
physical examination. 

If ﬂuid accumulates in the pleural cavity (hydro-
thorax), the lung collapses gradually and the medi-
astinum is displaced toward the opposite site. The 
presence of air in the pleural cavity (pneumothorax), 
caused by a penetrating wound, rupture of the lung, 
or injections for therapeutic reasons (to immobilize 

the lung in the treatment of tuberculosis), also col-
lapses the lung.

Collapse of the lung is caused by the recoil proper-
ties of its elastic ﬁbers. In the normal lung, such a 
recoil is prevented by negative intrapleural pressure 
and the close association of the parietal and visceral 
layers of the pleura.

Acute  and  chronic  inﬂammation  of  the  pleura 
is  secondary  to  a  bacterial  or  viral  inﬂammatory 
disease in the lungs. A ﬁbrinous exudate covers the 
mesothelial layer that may show reactive hyperplasia 
(Figure 13-24).

Mesothelioma  is  a  tumor  that  originates  in  the 
mesothelial cell lining of the pleura, the peritoneum, 
and the pericardium.  

Mesothelioma  is  associated  with  previous  long 
exposure (15 to 40 years) to asbestos, a ﬁbrous silicate 
mineral (see Figure 13-20). 

Pleural mesothelioma spreads within the thoracic 
cavity (pericardium or diaphragm, Figure 13-25) and 
metastasis can involve any organ, including the brain. 
Symptoms include pleural effusion, chest pain, and 
dyspnea.  Organ  imaging  studies  of  the  thorax  can 
detect  thickening  of  the  pleura  (asbestos  plaques) 
and ﬂuid containing tumoral cells.

In general, the most frequent cause of neoplasm 
in the pleura are metastatic tumors from breast and 
lung causing pleural effusion containing cancerous 
cells detected by cytology.

Essential concepts

Respiratory System

• The respiratory system consists of three 
portions: 
  (1) An air-conducting portion.
  (2) A respiratory portion for gas exchange 
between blood and air.
  (3) A mechanism of ventilation, controlled by 
the inspiratory and expiratory movements of 
the thoracic cage.

  

• The air-conducting portion consists of:
  (1) The nasal cavities and associated  
        sinuses. 
  (2) The nasopharynx.
  (3) The oropharynx.
  (4) The larynx.
  (5) The trachea.
  (6) The bronchi.
  (7) The bronchioles. 
   The respiratory portion includes:
  (1) The respiratory bronchioles.
  (2) The alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and    
        alveoli. 
  The ventilation mechanism involves: 
  (1) The thoracic or rib cage.
  (2) The intercostal muscles.
  (3) The diaphragm muscle.
  (4) The elastic connective tissue of the lungs.

• The functions of the nasal cavity and para-
nasal sinuses are warming and moistening 
air and ﬁltering dust particles present in the 
inspired air. 
   The respiratory portion is lined by pseu-
dostratiﬁed ciliated epithelium with goblet cells 
supported by a lamina propria consisting of 
connective tissue, seromucous glands, and a 
rich superﬁcial venous plexus (called cavern-
ous or erectile tissue). 
  Incoming air is warmed by blood in the 
venous plexus and moistened by secretions of 
the seromucous glands and goblet cells. The 
superior, middle, and inferior turbinate bones, 
or conchae, determine airﬂow disturbance to 
facilitate warming and moistening of air. 

  Paranasal sinuses (maxillary, frontal, ethmoid-
al, and sphenoidal sinuses) are lined by a thin 
pseudostratiﬁed columnar ciliated epithelium 
with few goblet cells.

• The nasopharynx is lined by a pseudostrati-
ﬁed columnar epithelium that changes to 
nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium at the 
oropharynx. Aggregates of mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue, forming part of Waldeyer’s 
ring, are present at the nasopharynx.

• The olfactory area is present on the roof of 
the nasal cavity. The mucosa of the olfac-
tory area consists of pseudostratiﬁed ciliated 
columnar epithelium with goblet cells ﬂanking 
the olfactory epithelium. 
  The olfactory epithelium consists of three cell 
types: 
  (1) Olfactory cells (bipolar neurons).
  (2) Basal cells (stem cells that differentiate 
into olfactory cells).
  (3) Sustentacular or supporting cells. 
  The underlying lamina propria contains the 
superﬁcial venous plexus, the glands of Bow-
man, and nerve bundles (called ﬁla olfactoria). 
   The olfactory cell has an apical region (the 
dendrite) characterized by a knob bearing 
nonmotile olfactory cilia. 
  Olfactory cilia contain odorant receptors that 
bind to odorant-binding proteins (produced 
by the gland of Bowman) carrying an inhaled 
odorant particle. 
  On the opposite site of the ciliary dendritic 
region, olfactory cells form small fascicles of 
unmyelinated axons surrounded by ensheath-
ing glial cells. 
  Axons penetrate the cribriform plate of the 
ethmoid bone and synapse with neurons in 
the olfactory bulb.  The axons of the olfactory 
cells converge to one or more glomeruli and 
interact predominantly with dendrites of mitral 
cells. 
  The olfactory bulb also contains interneurons 

called granule cells and tufted cells. Axons 
from mitral cells and tufted cells form the 
olfactory tract (olfactory nerve, or cranial nerve 
I), which carries olfactory information to the 
olfactory cortex. 
  The odorant–odorant binding protein 
complex attaches to receptors on cilia. Binding 
of the odorant receptor activates G protein 
coupled to the receptor. G protein activates 
adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the produc-
tion of cAMP from ATP. Ligand-gated Na+ 
channels are opened by cAMP to facilitate the 
diffusion of Na+ into the cell. The inﬂux of Na+ 
across the plasma membrane generates an 
action potential conducted to the brain along 
the olfactory nerve.
  Anosmia refers to deprivation of the sense 
of smell by disease or injury. 
  Olfactory cells have a life span of about 1 
to 2 months and are replaced throughout 
life by undifferentiated basal cells. Sensory 
endings of the trigeminal nerve, found in the 
olfactory epithelium, are responsible for the 
harmful sensation caused by irritants such as 
ammonia.

• The larynx consists of:
  (1) Cartilages (epiglottis, thyroid cartilage, 
cricoid cartilage, and arytenoid cartilage).
  (2) Intrinsic muscles (abductor, adductors, 
and tensors involved in phonation).
  (3) Extrinsic muscles (involved in swallow-
ing). 
   A nonkeratinizing stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium covers the lingual surface of the 
epiglottis and the false and  true vocal cords 
(also called folds). The rest is lined by a pseu-
dostratiﬁed ciliated epithelium with goblet 
cells and seromucous glands in the lamina 
propria. 
   The lamina propria of the true vocal cords 
has special characteristics of clinical signiﬁ-
cance:
  (1) The superﬁcial layer (under the stratiﬁed

squamous epithelium) consists of extracel-
lular matrix and very few elastic ﬁbers and 
ﬁbroblasts. This layer, called Reinke’s space, 
can accumulate ﬂuid (Reinke’s edema). 
  (2) The subjacent layers contain elastic and 
collagen ﬁbers corresponding to the vocal 
ligament. 
  (3) Deep in the lamina propria is the vocalis 
(thyroarytenoid) muscle. 
   There are no seromucous glands in the 
lamina propria of the true vocal cord.

• The trachea is lined by pseudostratiﬁed 
columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells. 
Basal cells and cells of Kulchitsky (neuroen-
docrine cells) rest on the basal lamina but do 
not extend to the lumen. The lamina propria 
contains elastic ﬁbers. Seromucous glands are 
observed in the submucosa. 
  Goblet cells, serous cells of the submucosa 
glands, and club cells of the terminal bron-
chioles secrete MUC5AC and MUC5B, two 
hygroscopic and lubricant glycoproteins, called 
mucins. They form a polymer in the mucus. 
  The mucus consists of:
  (1) A periciliary layer, in contact with the api-
cal domain of the ciliated columnar cells.
  (2) A mucus gel layer atop the periciliary 
layer. 
   In addition to mucins, the mucus contains 
antimicrobial agents, immunomodulatory 
proteins, and protective molecules.  
  A stack of C-shaped hyaline cartilage forms 
the framework of the trachea. The trachealis 
muscle (smooth muscle) connects the free 
ends of the C-shaped hyaline cartilage.
   Bronchial carcinoid tumors arise from cells 
of Kulchitsky. These small cells secrete peptide 
hormones (serotonin, somatostatin, calcitonin, 

antidiuretic hormone [ADH], adrenocortico-
tropic hormone [ACTH], and others). Bronchial 
carcinoid tumors (including small cell lung 
carcinoma) can invade locally and metastasize 
to regional lymph nodes.  

• As bronchi divide into intrapulmonary 
bronchi, the tracheal C-shaped rings break 
down into cartilage plates (distributed around 
the lumen) and smooth muscle bundles shift 
between the mucosa and the cartilage plates. 
   Aggregates of lymphoid tissue are observed 
in the wall of intrapulmonary bronchi (known 
collectively as BALT, bronchial-associated 
lymphoid tissue). 
   Further subdivisions give rise to terminal 
bronchioles, each supplying a pulmonary 
lobule. 
  Each respiratory bronchiole, subdivisions of 
a terminal bronchiole, gives rise to a pulmo-
nary acinus. Essentially, a pulmonary lobule 
consists of several pulmonary acini. 
  Relevant features of the wall of the terminal 
and respiratory bronchioles are the spiral-like 
arrangement of smooth muscle ﬁbers and the 
longitudinal distribution  of elastic ﬁbers. 
   Branches of the pulmonary artery, transport-
ing deoxygenated blood, run parallel to the 
bronchial tree. Branches of the bronchial 
artery provide nutrients to the walls of the 
bronchial tree. Recall that the pulmonary 
vein, carrying oxygenated blood, travels in the 
connective tissue septa limiting pulmonary 
lobules. 
   Asthma is characterized by:
  (1) Reversible bronchoconstriction of the 
smooth muscle bundles encircling the bron-
chiolar lumen.
  (2) Mucus hypersecretion by goblet cells 

triggered by allergens or autonomic neural 
factors.
  The consequence is a reduction in the 
lumen of the airways. Wheezing, cough, and 
shortness of breath (dyspnea) are classic 
symptoms.

• Terminal bronchioles lack cartilage and 
submucosal glands. The pseudostratiﬁed 
columnar ciliated epithelium decreases in 
height to ﬁnally become low columnar-to-
cuboidal with few ciliated cells. Surfactant-, 
protein-, and mucin-secreting club cells 
(formerly called Clara cells) predominate in 
the terminal bronchiole. Remember that the 
terminal bronchiole is the initiation site of a 
pulmonary lobule.
  Club cells produce:
  (1) Surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D.
  (2) Mucin MUC5AC and MUC5B mono-
mers, present as polymers in the airway 
mucus.
  (3) Anti-inﬂammatory club cell secretory 
protein (CCSP), involved in the protection of 
the airway epithelium against chronic injury or 
infection. 
   Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), or con-
strictive bronchiolitis, is characterized by 
progressive airﬂow obstruction. OB, attributed 
to a defective function of club cells, shows 
signiﬁcant peribronchiolar inﬂammation and 
obstructive ﬁbrosis, causing a reduction in the 
diameter  of the terminal bronchioles.
  
• Cystic ﬁbrosis results in the production of 
abnormally thick mucus by glands lining the 
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

result in defective Cl– transport and increased 
Na+ absorption. Bacterial infections are associ-
ated with the thick mucus plugs consisting of 
entangled MUC5AC and MUC5B polymers 
and dehydrated mucus. Cough, purulent se-
cretions, and dyspnea are typical symptoms.

• The wall of a respiratory bronchiole is 
discontinuous, interrupted by the saccular 
outpocketing of alveoli. Note that the wall of 
terminal bronchioles is not associated with 
alveoli. 
   Bundles of smooth muscle ﬁbers form 
knobs bulging into the lumen and the lining 
epithelium is cuboidal-to-simple squamous. 
Elastic ﬁbers are important components of the 
bronchioles and alveolar walls. 
  Emphysema is caused by a permanent 
enlargement of the air spaces distal to the 
terminal bronchioles due to the progressive 
and irreversible destruction of elastic tissue of 
the alveolar walls. 
   Elastic tissue in the interalveolar wall can be 
destroyed by elastase released by neutro-
phils present in the alveolar lumen. Serum 
(cid:95)1-antitrypsin neutralizes elastase. A persistent 
stimulus increases the number of neutrophils 
in the alveolar lumen, the source of elastase. 
  Serum levels of (cid:95)1-antitrypsin decrease and 
elastase starts the destruction of elastic ﬁbers. 
Damaged elastic ﬁbers cannot recoil when 
stretched and, as a result, adjacent alveoli be-
come conﬂuent, producing large air spaces, or 
blebs, the structural landmark of emphysema. 
The loss of elastic tissue also affects terminal 
and respiratory bronchioles.
  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) includes emphysema and asthma.

• The respiratory bronchiole represents the 
interface between the conducting and respira-
tory portions of the respiratory tract. The respi-
ratory bronchiole is regarded as the beginning 
of the respiratory portion. Remember that the 
respiratory bronchiole is the initiation site of a 
pulmonary or lung acinus.
   Each respiratory bronchiole gives rise to 
alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. 
  The alveolar epithelium consists of two 
cell types lining the surface of the capillaries 
(terminal branches of the pulmonary artery), 
and the alveolar wall. 
  (1) Type I alveolar cells represent about 40% 
of the alveolar epithelial cell population and 
cover 90% of the alveolar surface. 
  (2) Type II alveolar cells, about 60% of the 
cells, cover only 10% of the alveolar surface 
and are preferentially located at the angles 

formed by adjacent alveolar septa. Type II 
alveolar cells produce surfactant.
   Pulmonary surfactant contains:
  (1) Cholesterol (50%).
  (2) Phospholipids (40%).
  (3) SP (surfactant protein) SP-A, SP-B, and 
SP-C (10%). 
  Club cells also produce surfactant. Surfactant 
maintains alveolar expansion by modulating 
surface tension.
  Additional components of the alveolus 
include:
  (1) Endothelial cells (lining the alveolar 
capillaries).
  (2) Macrophages (alveolar phagocytes, or 
dust cells).
  (3) Alveolar dendritic cells.
  (4) Fibroblasts in the interalveolar septum 
(producing elastic ﬁbers).
  (5) Mast cells.

  Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome 
(RDS) in premature infants is caused by sur-
factant deﬁciency leading to the collapse of the 
alveolar walls. The development of a ﬁbrin-rich 
exudation, covering with a hyaline membrane 
the alveolar surface, complicates the RDS 
condition. Corticosteroids induce the synthesis 
of surfactant in the fetus. High levels of insulin 
in diabetic mothers antagonize the effect of 
corticosteroids.

• The air-blood barrier consists of:
  (1) The thin cytoplasmic extensions of type I 
alveolar cells.
  (2) A dual basal lamina produced by type I 
alveolar cells and subjacent endothelial cells 
lining the alveolar capillaries.
  (3) Cytoplasmic extensions of endothelial 
cells.
  (4) The plasma membrane of red blood 
cells. 
  Keep in mind that the biconcave shape 
of red blood cells favors the rapid O2-CO2 
exchange in the alveolar capillaries. Also note 
that surfactant contributes indirectly to an 
effective gas exchange by preventing alveolar 
collapse.

• Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) results from an increase in the 
hydrostatic pressure in the alveolar capillar-
ies (cardiogenic) or damage to the alveolar 
epithelial lining caused by bacterial endotoxins 
or trauma (noncardiogenic). 
These mechanisms result in increases in ﬂuid 
and proteins in the alveolar spaces (pulmonary 
edema).

• Lung cancer. Most lung tumors are malig-
nant. They can be primary tumors, originated 
in the lung, or secondary, or metastatic, 
spreading from other tumors.
  According to the cell types, primary lung can-
cer can be classiﬁed into two major groups:
  (1) Small cell lung cancer (SCLC; also called 
oat-cell carcinoma). SCLC is highly malignant 
and spreads very rapidly. About 15% of all 
lung cancers are SCLC. 
  (2) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
the most frequent tumor (about 85% of all 
lung cancers). 
  The NSCLC group includes:
  (1) Squamous cell carcinoma, a tumor 
derived from the transformation of the respi-
ratory epithelium into a squamous metaplastic 
epithelium.
  (2) Adenocarcinoma, a tumor originated 
from the bronchial epithelium and the 
bronchioalveolar epithelium (bronchioalveolar 
carcinoma). 
   Molecular screening of lung cancer samples 
is widely used for determining lung-cancer 
types and subtypes. For example, anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrange-
ments, present in approximately 5% of 
NSCLC, and mutations in the kinase domain 
of the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR), observed in 10% to 15% of NSCLC, 
are common in lung adenocarcinomas.
 
• The pleura consists of two layers: 
  (1) The visceral layer closely attached to the 
lung and lined by a simple squamous epithe-
lium (mesothelium).
  (2) The parietal layer also lined by mesothe-
lial cells and supported by connective tissue 
rich in fat. The visceral pleura glides on the 
parietal pleura during respiration. 
  Disorders of the pleura include:
  (1) Inﬂammatory processes causing pleural 
effusion  (abnormal accumulation of liquid in 
the pleural space). 
  (2) Accumulation of ﬂuid (hydrothorax).
  (3) Accumulation of blood (hemothorax).
  (4) Accumulation of chyle, a lipid-rich liquid 
transported from intestinal lacteals to systemic 
veins in the thorax through the thoracic duct 
(chylothorax).
  (5) Accumulation of air (pneumothorax). 

  Mesothelioma is a localized or diffuse 
malignant tumor of the pleura associated with 
asbestos exposure for long periods of time. 
Symptoms include pleural effusion, chest 
pain, and dyspnea. Mesothelioma can also 
affect the peritoneum and pericardium.

14. Urinary System

The urinary system has several essential functions: (1) to  clear  the blood of nitrogenous and other waste 
metabolic products by ﬁltration and excretion; (2) to  balance the concentration of body ﬂuids and electro-
lytes, also by ﬁltration and excretion; (3) to recover by reabsorption small molecules (amino acids, glucose, 
and peptides), ions (Na+, Cl–, Ca2+, PO3–), and water, in order to maintain blood homeostasis; (4) to 
regulate blood pressure by producing the enzyme renin, that initiates the conversion of angiotensinogen (a 
plasma protein produced in liver) to the active component angiotensin II; (5) to produces erythropoietin, 
a stimulant of red blood cell production in bone marrow; and (6) to activate 1,25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 
a vitamin D derivative involved in the control of calcium metabolism. This chapter correlates structure and 
function, highlighted by relevant renal physiologic and pathologic conditions. 

The kidneys
The urinary system consists of paired kidneys and 
ureters  and  a  single  urinary  bladder  and  urethra. 
Each  kidneys  has  a  cortex  (subdivided  into  outer 
cortex  and  juxtamedullary  cortex)  and  a  medulla 
(subdivided into outer medulla and inner medulla).
The  medulla  is  formed  by  conical  masses,  the 
renal medullary pyramids, with their bases located 
at the corticomedullary junction. A renal medullary 
pyramid, together with the associated covering corti-
cal region, constitutes a renal lobe. The base of the 
renal lobe is the renal capsule. The lateral boundaries 
of each renal lobe are the renal columns (of Bertin), 
residual structures representing the fusion of primi-
tive lobes within the metanephric blastema. The apex 
of each renal lobe terminates in a conic-shaped papilla 
surfaced by the area  cribrosa (perforated area; the 
opening site of the papillary ducts). The papilla is 
surrounded by a minor calyx. Each minor calyx col-
lects the urine from a papilla dripping from the area 
cribrosa. Minor calyces converge to form the major 
calyces which, in turn, form the pelvis.

Organization of the renal vascular system
The  main  function  of  the  kidneys  is  to  ﬁlter  the 
blood supplied by the renal arteries branching from 
the descending aorta. 

The kidneys receive about 20% of the cardiac out-
put per minute and ﬁlter about 1.25 L of blood per 
minute. Essentially, all the blood of the body passes 
through the kidneys every 5 minutes. 

About  90%  of  the  cardiac  output  goes  to  the 
renal cortex; 10% of the blood goes to the medulla. 
Approximately  125  mL  of  ﬁltrate  is  produced  per 
minute, but 124 mL of this amount is reabsorbed. 
About 180 L of ﬂuid ultraﬁltrate is produced in 
24  hours  and  transported  through  the  uriniferous 
tubules. Of this amount, 178.5 L is recovered by the 
tubular cells and returned to the blood circulation, 
whereas only 1.5 L is excreted as urine. 

We  start  our  discussion  by  focusing  on  the 

vascularization of the kidneys (Figure 14-1).

Oxygenated  blood  is  supplied  by  the  renal 
artery. The  renal  artery  gives  rise  to  several 
interlobar arteries, running across the medulla 
through the renal columns  along the sides of 
the pyramids. 

At the corticomedullary junction, interlobar 
arteries give off several branches at right angles, 
changing their vertical path to a horizontal direc-
tion to form the arcuate arteries, running along 
the corticomedullary boundary. 

The  renal  arterial  architecture  is  terminal. 
There are no anastomoses between interlobular 
arteries. This is an important concept in renal 
pathology for understanding focal necrosis as a 
consequence of an arterial obstruction. For ex-
ample, renal infarct can be caused by atheroscle-
rotic plaques in the renal artery or embolization 
of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta.

Vertical branches emerging from the arcuate 
arteries, the interlobular arteries, penetrate the 
cortex.  As  interlobular  arteries  ascend  toward 
the  outer  cortex,  they  branch  several  times  to 
form  the  afferent  glomerular  arterioles  (see 
Figure 14-1). 

The  afferent  glomerular  arteriole,  in  turn, 
forms the glomerular capillary network, envel-
oped by the two-layered capsule of Bowman, 
and continues as the efferent glomerular arte-
riole. This  particular  arrangement,  a  capillary 
network ﬂanked by two arterioles (instead of an 
arteriole and a venule) is called the glomerulus 
or arterial portal system (Figure 14-2). As dis-
cussed in Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System, the 
glomerular arterial portal system is structurally 
and functionally distinct from the venous portal 
system of the liver. 

Both  the  glomerulus  and  the  surrounding 
capsule  of  Bowman  form  the  renal  corpuscle

Figure 14-2. Arterial and venous portal systems

In general, a capillary network is 
interposed between an arteriole and a 
venule.

In the kidneys, an arteriole is interposed 
between two capillary networks. An afferent 
arteriole gives rise to a mass of capillaries, 
the glomerulus. These capillaries coalesce 
to form an efferent arteriole, which gives rise 
to capillary networks (peritubular capillary 
network and the vasa recta) surrounding the  
nephrons.

In the liver and hypophysis, veins feed 
into an extensive capillary or sinusoid 
network draining into a vein. This 
distribution is called the venous portal 
system.

(also called the malpighian corpuscle). The smooth 
muscle cell wall of the afferent glomerular arteriole 
displays epithelial-like cells, called juxtaglomerular 
cells, with secretory granules containing  renin. A 
few juxtaglomerular cells may be found in the wall 
of the efferent glomerular arteriole.

Vasa recta
Depending on the location of the renal corpuscle in 
the outer cortex or juxtamedullary cortex, the effer-
ent glomerular arteriole gives rise to two different 
capillary networks:

1. A peritubular capillary network, derived from 
afferent arterioles of renal corpuscles located in the 
outer cortex. 

The peritubular capillary network, lined by fenes-
trated endothelial cells, drains into the interlobular 
vein converging to the arcuate vein. Arcuate veins 
drain into the interlobar veins, which are continuous 
with the renal vein.

 2. The vasa recta (straight vessels), formed by 
multiple  branching    of  the    efferent  arterioles  lo-
cated  close  to  the  corticomedullary  junction. The 
descending components of the vasa recta (arterial 
capillaries  lined  by  continuous  endothelial  cells) 
extend into the medulla, parallel to the medullary 
segments of the uriniferous tubules, make a hairpin 
turn, and return to the corticomedullary junction 

as  ascending venous capillaries lined by fenestrated 
endothelial cells.  

Note that  the vascular supply to the renal medulla 
is largely derived from the efferent glomerular arte-
rioles. The descending vasa recta bundles penetrate 
to varying depths of the renal medulla, alongside the 
descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle 
and the collecting ducts. Side branches connect the 
returning ascending vasa recta to the interlobular and 
arcuate veins. Remember the close relationship of the 
vasa recta with each other and adjacent tubules and 
ducts. This is the structural basis of the countercurrent 
exchange and multiplier mechanism of urine forma-
tion as we discuss later.

Renal  medullary  pyramid,  renal  lobe,  and  renal 
lobule
A renal medullary pyramid is a medullary  structure 
limited by interlobar arteries at the  sides. The cortico-
medullary junction is the base and the papilla is the 
apex of the pyramid.

A renal lobe is a combined cortical-medullary struc-
ture. It consists of a renal medullary pyramid, together 
with the associated covering renal cortical region.  

A renal lobule is a cortical structure that can be 

deﬁned in two different ways (see Figure 14-1): 

1. The  renal  lobule  is  a  portion  of    the  cortex 
ﬂanked by two adjacent ascending interlobular arter-

The descending and ascending segments of cortical nephrons and a collecting

straight tubules forms a medullary ray within the cortex.
    A medullary ray is the axis of the lobule, a cortical structure. Nephrons of 
the same lobule drain into the collecting duct.

ies. Each interlobular artery gives rise to a series of 
glomeruli, each consisting of an afferent glomerular 
arteriole,  a capillary network, and the efferent glo-
merular arteriole. 

2. The renal lobule consists of a single collecting 
duct (of Bellini) and the surrounding cortical neph-
rons that drain into it. The ascending and descending 
segments of  cortical nephrons, together with  the 
single collecting duct, are components of a medullary 
ray (of Ferrein). A medullary ray is the axis of the 
lobule (Figure 14-3). 

Note that the cortex has many lobules and that 

each lobule has a single medullary ray. 

The uriniferous tubule: Nephron and collecting duct
Each kidney has about 1.3 million uriniferous  tu-
bules surrounded by a stroma containing loose con-
nective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.  
Each uriniferous tubule consists of two embryo-

logically distinct segments (Figure 14-4): 

1. The nephron.
2. The collecting duct. 
The nephron consists of two components: 

1. The renal corpuscle (300 (cid:43)m in diameter).
2. A long renal tubule (5 to 7 mm long). 
The renal tubule consists of: 
1. The proximal convoluted tubule.
2. The loop of Henle.
3. The  distal  convoluted  tubule, which empties 

into the collecting tubule. 

Collecting tubules have three distinct topographic 

distributions: 

1. A cortical collecting tubule, found in the renal 

cortex as the centerpiece of the medullary ray.

2. An outer medullary collecting tubule, present 

in the outer medulla.

3.  An  inner  medullary  segment,  located  in  the 

inner medulla. 

Depending on the distribution of renal corpuscles, 
nephrons can be either cortical or juxtamedullary. 
Renal tubules derived from cortical nephrons have 
a short loop of Henle that penetrates just up to the 
outer medulla. 

Renal tubules from juxtamedullary nephrons have 
a long loop of Henle projecting deep into the inner 
medulla  (Figure 14-5).

Henle and the distal convoluted

   Note that the macula densa is 
located at the initial portion of the

The renal corpuscle
The  renal  corpuscle,  or  malpighian  corpuscle  
(Figure 14-6),  consists of the capsule of Bowman 
investing  a capillary tuft, the glomerulus. 
The capsule of Bowman has two layers: 
1. The  visceral  layer,  attached  to  the  capillary 

glomerulus.

pole, the site of entry and exit of the afferent and ef-
ferent glomerular arterioles, is called the vascular pole.
The glomerulus consists of three cell components 

(Figure 14-7):

1. The podocytes, the visceral layer of the capsule 

of Bowman. 

2. The  fenestrated  endothelial  cells,  lining  the

stroma. 

The visceral layer is lined by epithelial cells called 
podocytes supported by a basal lamina. The parietal 
layer consists of a simple squamous epithelium con-
tinuous with the simple cuboidal epithelium of the 
proximal convoluted tubule (Figure 14-6).

A  urinary  space  (Bowman’s  space  or  capsular 
space), containing the plasma ultraﬁltrate (primary 
urine), exists between the visceral and parietal layers 
of the capsule. 

The urinary space is continuous with the lumen of 
the proximal convoluted tubule at the urinary pole, 
the gate through which the plasma ultraﬁltrate ﬂows 
into the proximal convoluted tubule. The opposite 

3. The mesangial cells, embedded in the mesangial 
matrix. Mesangium designates the combined mesan-
gial cells-mesangial matrix complex.

 

Glomerular ﬁltration barrier
The podocytes are mesenchymal-derived postmitotic 
cells. They  are  polarized  cells  with  their  nucleus-
containing  cell  body  bulging  into  the  glomerular 
urinary space. Long primary processes, arising from 
the cell body, branch and give rise to multiple endings, 
called foot processes or pedicels. Pedicels encircle and 
attach to the surface of the glomerular capillary, except 
at the endothelial cell-mesangial matrix interface (see 
Figure 14-6).

    The efferent glomerular arteriole  
branches  into a peritubular capillary 
network, surrounding the convoluted

nephrons.

    The efferent glomerular arteriole  
branches into vascular loops called 
the vasa recta. The vasa recta 
descend into the medulla and form a 
capillary network surrounding the 
collecting ducts and limbs of the 
loop of Henle.

Cortical nephron

Vasa recta

Podocytes and fenestrated endothelial cells each 
produce a basal lamina that, when combined, con-
stitute the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), 
a member of the glomerular ﬁltration barrier. The 
major components of the GBM are type IV collagen, 
laminin, ﬁbronectin, and heparan sulfate-containing  
proteoglycan.

The pedicels, derived from the same podocyte or 
from adjacent podocytes,  interdigitate to cover the 
GBM. Pedicels are separated from each other by gaps, 
called ﬁltration slits. Filtration slits are bridged by a 
membranous material, the ﬁltration slit diaphragm 
(Figure  14-8). The  ﬁltration  slit  diaphragm  is  the 
major size barrier to protein leakage. 

Pedicels are attached to the basal lamina by dystro-
glycans and  (cid:95)3(cid:96)1 integrin. Podocyte injury causes 
the detachment of pedicels from the GBM, a condi-
tion known as foot process effacement.

The podocyte ﬁltration slit diaphragm consists of 
nephrin molecules interacting in a homophilic man-
ner,  and  with  the  nephrin-related  transmembrane 
proteins  Neph1  and  Neph2  (not  shown  in  Figure 
14-8).    Nephrin  is  anchored  to  bundles  of  actin 
ﬁlaments (forming the core of the pedicel) which in-
teract with the proteins podocin and CD2-associated 
protein (CD2AP). 

The nephrin dimers create a structure retarding the 
passage of molecules that have crossed the endothelial 
fenestrations and the GBM. 

In addition to the components of the glomerular 
ﬁltration  barrier,  other  limiting  factors  controlling 
the passage of molecules in the plasma ultraﬁltrate 
are  molecular  size  and  electric  charge.  Molecules 
with a size less than 3.5 nm and positively charged 
or neutral are ﬁltered more readily. Albumin (3.6 nm 
and anionic) ﬁlters poorly.

   Components of the filtration barrier

             The endothelium of the glomerular capillaries is fenestrated 
1
and permeable to water, sodium, urea, glucose, and small proteins. 
Endothelial cells are coated by negatively charged glycoproteins 
(heparan sulfate), which slow down the filtration of large anionic 
proteins.

           The glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a product of 

2
endothelial cells and podocytes, contains type IV collagen, laminin, 
fibronectin, and proteoglycans rich in the glycosaminoglycan heparan 
sulfate, which also slows down the filtration of anionic proteins.

        The pedicels are interdigitating cell processes of podocytes 
3
covering the GBM and coated by a negatively charged 
glycoprotein coat. The space between adjacent pedicels is called 
the filtration slit. A filtration slit diaphragm bridges adjacent 
pedicels. (cid:95)3(cid:96)1 integrin anchors the pedicel to the basal lamina.
    The diaphragm consists of nephrin, a cell adhesion molecule 
of the immunoglobulin superfamily, anchored to actin filaments 
within the pedicel by the proteins CD2AP, zonula occludens 
(ZO)-1, and podocin.
    A mutation of the gene encoding nephrin causes congenital 
nephrotic syndrome, characterized by massive proteinuria 
(leakage of albumin in urine) and edema.  

Pathology: Defects of the GBM  
The fenestrated endothelial cells of the glomerular 
capillaries are covered by the GBM to which the foot 
processes of the podocytes attach (see Figure 14-8). 
Podocytes produce glomerular endothelial growth 
factor to stimulate the development of the endothe-
lium and maintenance of its fenestrations. 

The  endothelium  is  permeable  to  water,  urea, 
glucose,  and  small  proteins. The  surface  of  the 
endothelial  cells  is  coated  with  negatively  charged 
polyanionic  proteoglycans blocking the passage of 
large anionic proteins. 

The GBM contains type IV collagen, ﬁbronectin, 
laminin, and heparan sulfate as major proteins. Type 
IV collagen of the GBM consists of three (cid:95) chains, 
(cid:95)3, (cid:95)4 and (cid:95)5, forming a triple helix.  Most other 
basal laminae contain (cid:95)1 and (cid:95)2 chains and (cid:95)5 and 
(cid:95)6 chains. A correctly assembled ﬂexible non-ﬁbrillar 
network, that also includes laminin 11, is critical for 

maintaining the integrity of the GBM and its perme-
ability function.  

Type  IV  collagens  are  directly  involved  in  the 

pathogenesis of three renal diseases:

1. Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune dis-
order  consisting  in  progressive  glomerulonephritis 
and pulmonary hemorrhage, caused by (cid:95)3  autoan-
tibodies binding to the glomerular and lung alveolar 
basal laminae. 

2.  Alport’s  syndrome,  a  progressive  inherited 
nephropathy,  characterized  by  irregular  thinning, 
thickening, and splitting of the GBM. Alport’s syn-
drome is transmitted by an X-linked recessive trait, is 
predominant in males, and involves mutations of the 
(cid:95)5 chain gene. Patients with Alport’s syndrome, often 
associated with hearing loss (defective function of the 
stria vascularis of the cochlea) and ocular symptoms 
(defect of the lens capsule), have hematuria (blood in 
the urine) and progressive glomerulonephritis lead-

3. Benign familial hematuria, caused by a domi-
nant inherited mutation of the (cid:95)4 chain gene, which 
does not lead to renal failure as seen in ESRD.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Slit ﬁltration diaphragm
Congenital  nephrotic  syndrome  is  caused  by  a 
mutation in the nephrin gene leading to the absence 
or malfunction of the podocyte’s slit ﬁltration dia-
phragm. 

About 70 different mutations have been described. 
Affected  children  have  massive  proteinuria  even  in 
utero  and  the  nephrotic  syndrome  develops  soon 
after  birth.  Infants  display  abdominal  distention, 
hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Con-
genital nephrotic syndrome, particularly common in 
Finland, is lethal.

Mesangium
The mesangium (Greek mesos, middle; angeion, vessel) 
is an intraglomerular structure interposed between 
the glomerular capillaries.

Figure 14-10. Functions of mesangial cells and organization of the mesangium

Mesangial cells produce a mesangial 
matrix, which contains fibronectin and several 
types of collagen. Mesangial matrix 
accumulates in some forms of glomerular 
diseases (diffuse mesangial sclerosis) and 
obliterates capillaries.

surface. No GBM is present 
at the contact site. 

Capillary

Angiotensin II binding to the 
receptor stimulates mesangial cell 
contraction.

It consists of two components: 
1. The mesangial cell.
2. The mesangial matrix. 
In addition, mesangial cells aggregate outside the 
glomerulus (extraglomerular mesangial cells; Figure 
14-9; see Figures 14-6 and 14-7) in a space limited 
by the macula densa and the afferent and efferent 
glomerular arterioles. Intraglomerular mesangial cells 
are continuous with extraglomerular mesangial cells.
Mesangial cells are specialized pericytes with char-
acteristics of smooth muscle cells and macrophages. 

Mesangial cells are:
1. Contractile cells.
2. Phagocytic cells.
3. Capable of proliferation. 
They  synthesize  matrix  (ﬁbronectin)  and  sev-
eral  types  of  collagen  (types  IV,  V,  and  VI), 
and  secrete  biologically  active  substances  (pros-
taglandins  and  endothelins).  Endothelins  induce 
the constriction of afferent and efferent glomerular 
arterioles (Figure 14-10).

 Mesangial cells participate indirectly in the glo-

merular ﬁltration process by: 

1. Providing mechanical support for the glomeru-

lar capillaries. 

2. Controlling the turnover of the GBM material 

by their phagocytic activity. 

3.  Regulating  blood  ﬂow  by  their  contractile 

activity. 

4. Secreting prostaglandins and endothelins. 

5. Responding to angiotensin II. 
The  mesangial  cell-matrix  complex  is  in  direct 
contact with endothelial cells. Note that the GBM is 
not present at the mesangium site (see Figure 14-10).  
Instead, cytoplasmic margins of mesangial cells, con-
taining cytoskeletal contractile proteins, are closely 
associated to the endothelial cell surface.  

Immunoglobulins  and  complement  molecules, 
unable to cross the ﬁltration barrier remain in the me-
sangial matrix. The accumulation of immunoglobulin 
complexes in the matrix induces the production of 
cytokines by mesangial cells that trigger an immune 
response  leading  to  the  eventual  occlusion  of  the 
glomerular capillaries.

Pathology: Podocyte injury 
Podocyte  injury  of  congenital,  hereditary,  and 
acquired  origin  can  cause  glomerular  diseases.  Ac-
quired  glomerular  diseases  can  be  of  immune  and 
non-immune origin. 

Congenital  nephrotic  syndrome  is  an  example 
of a congenital cause of podocyte injury (see Figure 
14-8). Hereditary causes of podocyte injury include 
mutations in genes expressing podocyte-speciﬁc pro-
teins (such as podocin and (cid:96)1 integrin subunit). The 
most characteristic feature is the loss of interdigitating 
pedicels contacting the GBM, a condition known as 
foot process effacement (Figure 14-11).

Most glomerular diseases caused by podocyte injury 
are acquired. The damage to the glomerulus can be

Pathology of the mesangium

Figure 14-12. Pathology of the renal corpuscle: Glomerulonephritis

Acute proliferative diffuse glomerulonephritis

The deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement 
membrane (resulting from a bacterial, viral, or protozoal infection) 
triggers the proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells. In 
the presence of complement proteins, neutrophils accumulate in the 
lumen of the capillaries, which become occluded.
    A nephritic syndrome, characterized by hematuria, oliguria, 
hypertension, and edema, is diagnosed. Children are predominantly 
affected.
    The nephritic syndrome is reversible: Immune complexes are 
removed from the GBM, endothelial cells are shed, and the 
population of proliferative mesangial cells returns to normal. The 
renal function is reestablished.

Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis

 
The proliferation of the epithelial cells of the capsule of Bowman and 
infiltration of macrophages produce a crescent-like mass in most 
glomeruli. The crescent enlarges and compresses the glomerular 
capillaries, which are displaced and stop functioning. This condition 
progresses rapidly to renal failure.
    The accumulation of  fibrin and other serum proteins and the 
necrosis of the glomerular capillaries stimulate the proliferative 
process.
    Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated 
process and is detected in a number of conditions, such as 
Goodpasture’s syndrome (caused by antibodies binding to the 7S 
domain of type IV collagen of the GBM), systemic lupus 
erythematosus, or of unknown cause (idiopathic).

properties  of  the  glomerular  ﬁltration  barrier.  A 
complicating factor is that trapped antibody-antigen 
complexes provide binding sites to complement pro-
teins, which also contribute to the glomerular damage 
(see Chapter 10, Immune-Lymphatic System, for a 
review of the complement cascade).

As we have seen, autoantibodies can target speciﬁc 
chains of type IV collagen, a component of the glo-
merular ﬁltration barrier. In addition, the deposit of 
complement proteins in the mesangial matrix pro-
duces a granular pattern (see Figure 14-11). Systemic 
lupus erythematosus and bacterial (streptococci) and 

Glomerulonephritis

viral (hepatitis B virus) infections generate antibody-
antigen complexes circulating in blood and trapped 
in the glomerular ﬁltration barrier.

Immune complexes can deposit between the endo-
thelial cells of the glomerular capillaries and the basal 
lamina (subendothelial deposits, see Figure 14-11), 
in the mesangium, and less frequently between the 
basal lamina and the foot processes of podocytes.

Immune  complexes    produced  after  bacterial 
infection can cause the proliferation of glomerular 
cells  (endothelial  and  mesangial  cells)  and  attract 
neutrophils and monocytes. This condition, known 
as acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, is observed 
in children and is generally reversible with treatment. 
This disease is more severe in adults: it can evolve into 
rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis 
(Figure 14-12).

A typical feature of crescentic glomerulonephritis 
is the presence of glomerular cell debris and ﬁbrin, 
causing severe glomerular injury. The proliferation of 
parietal cells of the capsule of Bowman and migrating 
neutrophils and lymphocytes into the space of Bow-
man occur. Both the cellular crescents and deposits 
of ﬁbrin compress the glomerular capillaries.

Juxtaglomerular apparatus
The  juxtaglomerular  apparatus  is  a  well  deﬁned 
endocrine structure consisting of: 

1. The macula densa (see Figures 14-6, 14-7, and 
14-9), a distinct region of the initial portion of the 
distal convoluted tubule. 

2. The extraglomerular mesangial cells (see Figure 
14-9), a space outlined by the macula densa and the 
afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles. 

3. The  renin-producing  cells  (juxtaglomerular 
cells) of the afferent glomerular arteriole (see Figures 
14-7 and 14-9) and, to a lesser extent, the efferent 
glomerular arteriole.

The macula densa is sensitive to changes in NaCl 
concentration and affects renin release by juxtaglo-
merular cells. Renin is secreted when the NaCl con-
centration in the ﬁltrate decreases.  Extraglomerular 
mesangial cells (also called lacis cells) are connected 
to  each  other  and  to  juxtaglomerular  cells  by  gap 
junctions.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is one of the  com-
ponents of the tubuloglomerular feedback mecha-
nism involved in the autoregulation of renal blood 
ﬂow and glomerular ﬁltration. 

The  other  component  is  the  sympathetic  nerve 
ﬁbers (adrenergic) innervating the juxtaglomerular 
cells.  Renin secretion is enhanced by norepinephrine 
and dopamine secreted by adrenergic nerve ﬁbers. 
Norepinephrine binds to (cid:95)1-adrenergic receptors in 
the afferent glomerular arteriole to cause vasocon-
striction. There is no parasympathetic innervation.

We come back to the tubuloglomerular feedback 
mechanism when we discuss the renin-angiotensin 
regulatory mechanism.

Proximal convoluted tubule
Cuboidal epithelial cells, held together by apical tight 
junctions, line the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) 
and have structural characteristics for reabsorption. 
They display the following features (Figure 14-13): 
1. An apical domain with a well-developed brush 

border consisting of microvilli.

2.  A  basolateral  domain  with  extensive  plasma 

membrane infoldings and interdigitations. 

3. Long mitochondria located between the plasma 
membrane  folds  provide  adenosine  triphosphate 
(ATP)  for  active  transport  of  ions  mediated  by  an 
Na+, K+-ATPase activated pump. 

4. Apical tubulovesicles and lysosomes provide a 
mechanism for endocytosis and breakdown of small 
proteins into amino acids. The movement of glucose 
and Na+ across the plasma membrane is mediated by 
a symport transport protein.  

The plasma ultraﬁltrate in the glomerular urinary 
space  is  transported  by  active  and  passive  mecha-
nisms along the PCT, where about 70% of ﬁltered 
water, glucose, Na+, Cl -, and K+, and other solutes 
are reabsorbed. 

The  driving  force  for  water  reabsorption  is  the 
electrochemical gradient produced by the reabsorp-
tion of solutes, such as NaCl and glucose. Because 
of the higher water permeability of the PCT, water 
passes by osmosis across tight junctions (paracellular 
pathway) into the lateral intercellular space. An in-
crease in the hydrostatic pressure in the intercellular 
compartment forces ﬂuids and solutes to move into 
the capillary network.  

Epithelial cells lining the PCT are involved in the 
production of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin 
D.  We  discuss  in  Chapter  19,  Endocrine  System, 
details of the metabolism of vitamin D and calcium 
absorption. 

The Fanconi syndrome is a renal hereditary (prima-
ry) or acquired (secondary) disease in which PCTs fail 
to reabsorb amino acids and glucose. Consequently, 
these substances are excreted in urine. The cause is a 
defective cellular energy metabolism resulting from 
impaired mitochondrial ATP levels or abnormal activ-
ity of the Na+ K+ ATPase pump. Aminoaciduria (an 
abnormal amount of amino acids in the urine) is the 
prominent feature of Fanconi syndrome.

Pathology: Acute kidney injury

Acute  kidney  injury  is  deﬁned  by  a  sudden  in-
crease in the concentration of creatinine in serum 
and  a  decrease  in  urinary  output.  It  is  caused  by 
glomerulonephritis, renal vascular disease, prerenal

The PCT reabsorbs about 70% of filtered water and the bulk of solutes. The

the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the PCT. It is also present in the

azotemia (abnormally high level of nitrogen waste 
products in the blood), acute tubular necrosis, and 
acute interstitial nephritis. 

The epithelial lining of the PCT loses the brush 
border and the connective tissue of the intertubular 
space  is  infiltrated  by  inflammatory  cells  (lym-
phocytes  and  macrophages).  Activated  ﬁbroblasts 
produce collagen causing interstitial ﬁbrosis. Tubu-
lointerstitial  damage  and  endothelial  injury  affect 
renal cellular function and increase the risk of the 
development of cardiovascular disease. 

An episode of acute kidney injury may progress 
to  subsequent chronic kidney disease, regardless the 
cause of acute kidney injury, and an enhanced risk of 
ESRD and mortality resulting from complications of 
cardiovascular disease. 

Loop of Henle 
The loop of Henle consists of a descending limb and 
an ascending limb.  Each limb is formed by a thick 
segment and a thin segment (Figure 14-14). 

The thick descending segment (proximal straight 
tubule) is a continuation of the PCT.  The thick as-
cending segment (distal straight tubule) is continuous 
with the distal convoluted tubule. 

The length of the thin segments varies in corti-
cal  and  juxtamedullary  nephrons.  Like  the  PCT, 
the  thin  descending  segment  harbors  aquaporin 
1 channels and  is highly permeable to water. The 
thin  ascending  segment  is  impermeable  to  water 
but reabsorbs salts. 

Salt moves into the interstitium of the medulla; 
water  is transported towards the outer medulla and 
juxtamedullary cortex where it returns to the systemic 
blood circulation.   

The  loop  of  Henle  reabsorbs  about  15%  of  the 
ﬁltered water and 25% of the ﬁltered NaCl, K+, Ca2+, 
–.  As  in  the  PCT,  an  Na+,  K+-ATPase 
and  HCO3
pump  in  the  ascending  limb  is  a  key  element  in 
the  reabsorption  of  salts.  Inhibition  of  this  pump 
by diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) inhibits the 
reabsorption of NaCl and increases urinary excretion 
of both NaCl and water by reducing the osmolality 
of the interstitial ﬂuid in the medulla.

The thick segments of the limbs are lined by a low 
cuboidal epithelium in transition with the epithelial 
lining of the convoluted tubules.  

Epithelial  cells  in  this  segment  synthesize  the 
Tamm-Horsfall protein, the most abundant protein 
present  in  urine. The  thin  segments  are  lined  by 
a  squamous  simple  epithelium  (Figure  14-15,  see 
Figure 14-14).

Distal convoluted tubule
The cuboidal epithelial cell lining of the distal convo-
luted tubule (DCT) has the following characteristics 
(Figure 14-16; see also Figure 14-9): 

1. Cuboidal cells are shorter than those in the PCT 

and lack a prominent brush border. 

2. As in the PCT, the plasma membrane of the ba-
solateral domain is infolded and lodges mitochondria. 
3. The cells of the macula densa display reversed 
polarity: the nucleus occupies an apical position and 
the basal domain faces the juxtaglomerular cells and 
extraglomerular  mesangial  cells  (see  Figure  14-9). 
The  macula  densa,  located  at  the  junction  of  the 
ascending thick segment of the loop of Henle with 
the  DCT,  senses  changes  in  Na+  concentration  in 
the tubular ﬂuid.

Identification parameters of PCTs and DCTs

The identification of proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs) and DCTs is 
facilitated by the following parameters:
1. Both are adjacent to renal corpuscles.
2. PCTs contain cells with abundant lysosomes (stained dark in both light 
microscope illustrations).

3. The apical domain of PCTs has a prominent brush border 
(microvilli) and vesicles. In contrast, the apical domain of DCTs 
has sparse microvilli and vesicles.
4. Cells lining the PCTs and DCTs contain abundant 
mitochondria.

mately 7% of the ﬁltered NaCl. The distal portion 
of the DCT and the collecting ducts are permeable 
to  water  in  the  presence  of  antidiuretic  hormone 
(ADH, or vasopressin). 

NaCl enters the cell across the apical domain and 
leaves the cell by an Na+, K+-ATPase pump (Figure 
14-16). The  reabsorption  of  NaCl  is  reduced  by 
thiazide  diuretics  that  inhibit  the  apical  domain 

transporting mechanism (discussed later).  

The active dilution of the tubular ﬂuid initiated in 
the ascending segments of the loop of Henle contin-
ues in the DCT. Because the ascending segment of 
the loop of Henle is the major site where water and 
solutes are separated, the excretion of both dilute and 
concentrated urine requires the normal function of 
this segment of the loop of Henle.

Aldosterone (from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland cortex) stimulates 
the reabsorption of Na+ at the collecting tubule.  Retention of Na+ results in water 
retention, helping to correct hypovolemia (decrease in total body water) and 
hyponatremia (decrease in total body Na+). 

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD) results from mutations in either two genes: PKD1 
and PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 proteins, 
which occur predominantly in the cilium of principal cells 
lining the collecting tubules. 
    Polycystin-1 is a membrane receptor interacting with 
proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Polycystin-2 acts as a 
Ca2+-permeable channel. 
    Mutations of the PKD1 gene account for 85% to 90% of 
cases of ADPKD mutations; mutations of the PKD2 gene 
account for 10% of cases. A complete loss of PKD1 or 
PKD2 gene expression results in extensive cystic 
enlargement of both kidneys.  Cysts are derived from the 
dilation of the collecting tubules and remain connected to 
the nephron of origin. Nephron segments also show cystic 
dilations. 
   Hypertension and renal failure are clinical manifestations.

Collecting tubule/duct 
The  DCT  is  linked  to  the  collecting  tubule  by  a 
connecting tubule. The connecting tubule and the 
collecting tubule (called duct as it increases in diam-
eter) are lined by a cuboidal epithelium composed of 
two cell types (Figure 14-17): 

1. Principal cells.
2. Intercalated cells. 
Principal cells have an apical primary cilium and a 
basolateral domain with moderate infoldings and mi-
tochondria. They reabsorb Na+ and water and secrete 
K+ in an Na+,K+-ATPase pump-dependent manner.

permeable channel.

A  mutation  of  either  the  gene  PKD1,  encoding 
polycystin-1, or PKD2, encoding polycystin-2, results 
in autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys disease 
(ADPKD). A complete loss of PKD1 or PKD2 gene 
expression results in the formation of massive renal 
cysts derived from dilated collecting ducts. Blood hy-
pertension and progressive renal failure after the third 
decade of life are characteristic ﬁndings in patients 
with ADPKD. Renal dialysis and renal transplanta-
tion can extend the life span of patients. 

Renal interstitium
We noted in Figure 14-15 the presence of vertical 
stacks  of  resident  ﬁbroblasts  extending  from  the 
loops of Henle to adjacent vasa recta like the rungs 
of a ladder. Dendritic cells, migrating cells of the im-
mune system, are also seen in the renal interstitium.

There are two populations of interstitial cells: 
1. Renal cortical ﬁbroblasts.
2. Renal medullary ﬁbroblasts. 
Cortical ﬁbroblasts predominate in the juxtamed-
ullary cortex and produce erythropoietin. Synthetic 
erythropoietin  is  used  in  the  treatment  of  anemia 
resulting from chronic renal failure or cancer che-
motherapy. We discussed in Chapter 6, Blood and 
Hematopoiesis,  the  mechanism  by  which  erythro-
poietin stimulates the production of red blood cells. 
Medullary ﬁbroblasts, within the inner medulla, 
are arranged in a ladder-like fashion (see Figure 14-
15) and contain lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. They 
produce glycosaminoglycans and vasoactive prosta-
glandin E2 that may regulate papillary blood ﬂow. 
Activated dendritic cells, expressing class II ma-
jor  histocompatibility  antigen,  and  inﬂammatory 
cells  (macrophages  and  lymphocytes)  participate 
in  interstitial  nephritis  (tubulointerstitial  disease) 
caused by nephrotoxic drugs (such as heavy metals or 
hypersensitivity to penicillin) or by an immunologic 
mechanism (for example, lupus erythematosus).

Excretory passages of urine
The urine released at the openings of the papillary 
ducts ﬂows from the calyces and pelvis into the ure-
ters and enters the urinary bladder. Peristaltic waves, 
spreading from the calyces along the ureter, force the 
urine toward the bladder.

The walls of the ureter and urinary bladder (Figure 
14-18) contain folds (rugae). As the bladder ﬁlls with 
urine, the folds ﬂatten and the volume of the bladder 
increases with minimal rise in intravesical pressure. 
The renal calyces, pelvis, ureter, and urinary blad-
der are lined by the urothelium, a pseudotratiﬁed 
epithelium with a transitional conﬁguration in re-
sponse to distension and contraction. The urothelium 
is  composed  of  basal  cells,  intermediate  cells  and 
dome-shaped superﬁcial cells, all of them contacting 
the basal lamina. The epithelium and the subjacent 
ﬁbroelastic lamina propria are surrounded by com-
bined  helical  and  longitudinal  layers  of  smooth 
muscle ﬁbers. 

In the bladder, a mixture of randomly arranged 
smooth  muscle  cells  form  the  syncytial    detrusor 
muscle. At the neck of the urinary bladder, the muscle 
ﬁbers form a three-layer (inner longitudinal, middle 
circular, and outer longitudinal) internal functional 
sphincter. 

Micturition, the process of emptying the urinary 
bladder, involves the micturition reﬂex, an automatic 
spinal cord reﬂex, and the stimulation of the detrusor 
muscle by parasympathetic ﬁbers to contract.

Nephrolithiasis is a condition in which kidneys 
stones,  composed  of  calcium  salts,  uric  acid,  or 
magnesium-ammonium acetate, form by crystalliza-

tion when urine is concentrated. When the ureter is 
blocked by a stone, the contraction of the smooth 
muscle generates severe pain in the ﬂank.

The male urethra is 20 cm long and consists of 
three  segments.  Upon  leaving  the  urinary  bladder, 
the  prostatic  urethra,  lined  by  transitional  epithe-
lium, crosses the prostate gland, continues as a short 
membranous urethra segment, and ends as the penile 
urethra, which is enclosed by the corpus spongiosum 
of the penis (see Figure 21-12 in Chapter 21, Sperm 
Transport and Maturation). Both the membranous 
and penile urethra are lined by pseudostratiﬁed or 
stratiﬁed columnar epithelium. 

The female urethra is 4 cm long and its longitudi-
nally microfolded mucosa is covered by a pseudostrat-
iﬁed columnar to stratiﬁed squamous epithelium that 
becomes moderately keratinized stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium  near  the  urethral  meatus.   The  lamina 
propria contains elastic ﬁbers and a venous plexus. An 
inner smooth muscle layer and an external striated 
muscle layer (continuous with the internal sphincter) 
are present in the wall. Additional structural details of 
the male and female urethra can be found in Chapter 
21, Sperm Transport and Maturation, and Chapter 
22, Follicle Development and The Menstrual Cycle, 
respectively. 

Regulation of water and NaCl absorption
Several hormones and factors regulate the absorption 
of  water  and  NaCl  (see  Box  14-A  for  a  review  of 
terminology related to osmoregulation):

1.  Angiotensin  II  stimulates  NaCl  and  water 
reabsorption in the PCT. A decrease in the extracel-
lular  ﬂuid  volume  activates  the  renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system and increases the concentration 
of plasma angiotensin II.

 2. Aldosterone, synthesized by the glomerulosa 
cells of the adrenal cortex, stimulates the reabsorp-
tion of NaCl at the ascending segment of the loop 
of Henle, the DCT, and the collecting tubule. An 
increase in the plasma concentration of angiotensin 
II and K+ stimulates aldosterone secretion.

3.  Atrial  natriuretic  peptide,  a  28-amino-acid 
peptide secreted by atrial cardiocytes (see Figure 12-3 
in Chapter 12, Cardiovascular System), has two main 
functions: 

(1) It increases the urinary excretion of NaCl and 

water.

(2) It inhibits NaCl  reabsorption. 
The atrial-renal reﬂex pursues an enhancement of 
sodium and water excretion by sensing a distended 
left atrium resulting in a reduction in the secretion 
of renin and aldosterone. 

4.  Antidiuretic  hormone,  or  vasopressin,  is  the 
most important hormone in the regulation of water 
balance. ADH is a small peptide (nine amino acids in

When  the  extracellular  ﬂuid  volume  decreases

the  collecting  tubule  to  water,  thereby  increasing 
water reabsorption. When ADH is not present, the

 Box 14-A  |  Terminology to remember
  

• Osmolality is the concentration of solutes in body ﬂuids. Alterations in osmo-
lality depend on the gain or loss of water or on the loss or gain of osmoles (for 
example, glucose, urea, and salts). Plasma osmolality is kept normalized by the 
excretion of excess water, recovery of lost water, or by normalization of solute 
levels in the body.
• Molarity and molality refer to the concentration of a solute in a solution.  The 
units of molarity are mol solute/L solution. The units of molality are mol solute/
kg solvent. Osmolality and osmolarity represent the number of moles of solute 
particles in a solution (for example, Na+ and Cl– separately) instead of moles of 
compound in solution (for example, NaCl).
• Osmosis is the passive diffusion of water (the solvent) across a membrane 
from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentra-
tion. Osmotic equilibrium is reached when the amount of solute is equal on both 
sides of a membrane and the inﬂux of water stops. Osmosis depends on the 
number of free dissolved particles without distinction between different molecu-
lar species (for example, Na+ and Cl–).
• Osmotic pressure is an indicator of how much water a compartment will 
draw into it through osmosis. Osmolarity and osmolality of the compartments on 
either side of a membrane determine the osmotic pressure of a compartment.
• Plasma membrane pumps and channels ensure that solutes are not distrib-
uted evenly on either side of a membrane as water does. If solutes distributed 
evenly, a concentration gradient would not exist to drive osmosis. 
• Effective osmoles. A solute such as urea is not an effective osmole because 
it does not create osmotic pressure. Solutes such as Na+, K+, and Cl– are effec-
tive osmoles. Pumps and channels keep Na+ outside of cells and K+ inside of 
cells as effective osmoles.
• Aquaporins. The permeability of cells to water is facilitated by plasma 
membrane water channels called aquaporins. Different tissues have variable 
amounts of aquaporins and the cells may be more or less permeable to water 
than others. Antidiuretic hormone determines the insertion of aquaporins in the 
collecting duct, increasing its permeability to water.

to correct hyperosmolality, and hypernatremia (high 
levels of Na+ in plasma), polyuria (excessive volume 
of urine and frequency of urination), and polydipsia 
(thirst and increasing drinking) occur. 

In diabetes mellitus, the concentration of glucose 
in  plasma  is  abnormally  elevated.  Glucose  over-
whelms the reabsorptive capacity of the PCT, and 
intratubular glucose levels increase. Acting as an ef-
fective osmole, intratubular glucose hampers water 
reabsorption even in the presence of ADH. 

Osmotic  diuresis  is  responsible  for  glucosuria 
(presence of glucose in urine), polyuria, and poly-
dipsia in the diabetic patient. 

No glucosuria is observed in patients with diabetes 

insipidus.

 

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
The RAS is a signiﬁcant component of the tubulo-
glomerular feedback system, essential for the mainte-
nance of  systemic arterial blood pressure when there 
is a reduction in the vascular volume. 

A reduction in vascular volume results in a decrease 
in the rate of glomerular ﬁltration and the amount of 
ﬁltered NaCl. A reduction in ﬁltered NaCl is sensed 

by the macula densa, which triggers renin secretion 
and the production of  angiotensin II, a potent va-
soconstrictor.

The tubuloglomerular feedback system consists of:
1. A glomerular component: The juxtaglomeru-
lar cells predominate in the muscle cell wall of the 
afferent glomerular arteriole but are also present in 
smaller number in the efferent glomerular arteriole. 
Juxtaglomerular  cells  synthesize,  store,  and  release 
renin. Activation of sympathetic nerve ﬁbers results 
in the increased secretion of renin.

2. A tubular component: The macula densa medi-
ates renin secretion after sensing the NaCl content 
in  the  incoming  urine  from  the  thick  ascending 
segment of the limb of Henle. When the delivery of 
NaCl to the macula densa decreases, renin secretion 
is enhanced. Conversely, when NaCl increases, renin 
secretion decreases.

The  RAS  consists  of  the  following  components 

(Figure 14-19):

1. Angiotensinogen (AGT), a circulating protein 

in plasma produced by the liver.

2. The  juxtaglomerular  cells,  the  source  of  the 
proteolytic enzyme renin, which converts angioten-
sinogen to angiotensin I (ANG I), a decapeptide with 
no known physiologic function.

3. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a 
product  of  pulmonary  and  renal  endothelial  cells, 
which  converts  angiotensin  I  to  the  octapeptide 
angiotensin II (ANG II). 

ANG II has several important functions: 
1. It stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the 

adrenal cortex. 

2.  It  causes  vasoconstriction,  which,  in  turn, 
increases blood pressure. ANG II binds to ANG II 
receptor type 1 (AT1R). ANG II receptor blockers 
(ARB) are extensively used in the clinic to regulate 
elevated blood pressure.

3.  It  enhances  the  reabsorption  of  NaCl  by  the 

PCT of the nephron. 

4. It stimulates ADH release.
Aldosterone  acts  primarily  on  principal  cells  of 
the collecting tubule and secondarily on the thick 
ascending segment of the loop of Henle to increase 
the entry of NaCl across the apical membrane. As 
with all steroid hormones, aldosterone enters the cell 
and binds to a cytosolic receptor. The aldosterone-
receptor complex enters the nucleus and stimulates 
gene activity required for the reabsorption of NaCl. 
An activated RAS is a major risk factor of  cardio-
vascular and renal disease. Inhibitors of RAS (renin 
and ACE inhibitors and ARB ) are extensively used 
in the clinic. The RAS is also closely associated to 
metabolic  diseases.  Inhibitors  of  RAS  have  shown 
to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in high risk 
populations.

      The medullary

collecting tubule 
reabsorbs NaCl and is 
moderately permeable 
to water and urea 
despite the absence of 
ADH.       
    Urea enters the 
collecting duct from 
the interstitium. 
    In the presence of 
ADH, water diffuses 
into the interstitium 
and the osmolality of 
tubular fluid increases 
and urine 
concentration begins 
(because of NaCl 
reabsorption and urea 
entering the collecting 
duct in addition to the 
already present urea).

       The ascending segment is impermeable to water but permeable 
3
to NaCl and urea. 
    NaCl is passively reabsorbed (the concentration of luminal NaCl is 
greater than the interstitial NaCl concentration) and urea diffuses into 
the tubular fluid (urea concentration in the lumen is less than that in 
the interstitium). 
    Dilution of the tubular fluid occurs and urine becomes gradually 
hypo-osmotic with respect to plasma. 
    Note that NaCl and urea (and other solutes) in the interstitial fluid 
provide the driving force for reabsorption. 
    Urea is produced in the liver as a product of protein metabolism 
and enters the nephron by glomerular filtration.

       The distal convoluted tubule and part of the collecting tubule 
4
reabsorb NaCl (under the influence of aldosterone) but are 
impermeable to urea. 
    In the absence of ADH, the collecting duct is impermeable to 
water (NaCl is reabsorbed without water) and the osmolality is 
reduced. The fluid entering the collecting ducts is hypo-osmotic 
with respect to plasma.

       The vasa recta are a capillary network that removes, in a 
6
flow-dependent manner, excess of water and solutes 
continuously added to the interstitium by the nephron segments.

Countercurrent multiplier and exchanger
The kidneys regulate water balance and are the major 
site for the release of water from the body. Water is 
also lost by evaporation from the skin and the respi-
ratory tract and from the gastrointestinal tract (fecal 
water and diarrhea).

Water excretion by the kidneys occurs indepen-
dently of other substances, such as Na+, Cl–, K+, H+, 
and urea. The kidneys excrete either concentrated 
(hyperosmotic) or diluted (hypo-osmotic) urine. 

ADH    regulates  the  volume  and  osmolality  of 
the urine without modifying the excretion of other 

solutes. The primary action of ADH  is to increase 
the permeability of the collecting tubule to water. An 
additional action is to increase the permeability of 
the collecting ducts at the medullary region to urea.
Figure 14-20 summarizes the essential steps of urine 

formation and excretion. Brieﬂy:

Diuretics are drugs that increase the 
output of urine (diuresis) by acting on 
specific membrane transport proteins. 
The common effect of diuretics is the 
inhibition of Na+ reabsorption by the 
nephron leading to an increase in the 
excretion of Na+ (natriuresis).

Diuretics are used as adjunctive

renal failure). They are used to  
treat hypertension and open-angle 
glaucoma.

             (mannitol)

 

Osmotic diuresis affects the 
transport of water across the 
epithelial cells lining the PCT 
and thin descending segment 
of the loop of Henle. Osmotic 
diuretics enter the nephron by 
glomerular filtration and generate 
an osmotic pressure gradient.       
    Osmotic diuretics do not 
inhibit a specific membrane 
transport protein. When urea 
and glucose are present in 
abnormally high concentrations 
(diabetes mellitus or renal 
diseases), they can behave as 
osmotic diuretics.

 

 

     (acetazolamide)

2       Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors  
 
Carbonic acid inhibitors reduce Na+ 
reabsorption by their effects on carbonic 
anhydrase, present mainly in the PCT.  The 
Na+,H+ antiporter in the apical membrane 
of PCT cells depends on H+ for Na+ 
exchange.  
    H+ is secreted in the tubular fluid where it 
combines with filtered HCO3– to form 
H2CO3. H2CO3 is hydrolyzed to CO2 and 
H2O by carbonic anhydrase located on the 
apical membrane of the PCT to facilitate 
CO2 and H2O reabsorption.  Carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitors reduce  the 
reabsorption of HCO3–.  Because the 
amount of secreted H+ depends on Na+, 
inhibition of carbonic anhydrase causes a 
decrease in Na+, H2O, and HCO3– 
reabsorption, leading to natriuresis.

3        Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide,  
 

    mercurials)

 

 

 

Loop diuretics are the most potent diuretics 
available to inhibit Na+ reabsorption by the thick 
ascending segment of the loop of Henle by 
blocking the Na+, 2Cl–, K+ symporter located in 
the apical membrane of the epithelial cells. Loop 
diuretics also perturb the process of 
countercurrent multiplication (the ability to dilute 
or concentrate urine). 

        Thiazides (chlorothiazide)
4

Thiazide diuretics inhibit Na+ reabsorption in the 
initial portion of the DCT by blocking the 
Na+, Cl– symporter present in the apical cell 
membrane.  Because water cannot cross this 
portion of the nephron and this is the site of urine 
dilution, thiazides reduce the ability to dilute the 
urine by inhibition of NaCl reabsorption.

interstitium,  water  and  NaCl  equilibrate  and  the 
tubular ﬂuid becomes hyperosmotic.

3. When the ﬂuid reaches the bend of the loop, its 

composition is hyperosmotic.

4. The  ascending  limb  of  the  loop  of  Henle  is 
impermeable to water.  The concentration of  NaCl 
in  the  lumen,  greater  than  in  the  interstitium,  is 
reabsorbed and enters the descending (arterial) por-
tion of the vasa recta. Therefore, the ﬂuid leaving this 

tubular segment is hypo-osmotic. This segment of the 
nephron is called the diluting segment.

5. The distal convoluted tubule and cortical por-
tions of the collecting tubule reabsorb NaCl. In the 
absence of ADH, water permeability is low. In the 
presence of ADH, water diffuses out of the collecting 
tubule into the interstitium and enters the ascending 
(venous) segment of the vasa recta. The process of 
urine concentration starts.

6. The medullary regions of the collecting tubule 
reabsorb urea. A small amount of water is reabsorbed 
and the urine is concentrated.

A relevant function of the loop of Henle is to pro-
duce and maintain and interstitial osmotic gradient 
that increases from the renal cortex (~290 mOsm/
kg) to the tip of the medulla (~1200 mOsm/kg). The 
mechanism  by which the loop of Henle generates 
the hypertonic medullary osmotic gradient is known 
as countercurrent multiplication. 

This designation is based on:
1. The ﬂow of ﬂuid in opposite directions (coun-
tercurrent ﬂow) within the two parallel limbs of the 
loop of Henle.

2. The differences in permeability of sodium and 

water in the descending and ascending segments.

3. The active reabsorption of sodium in the thick 

ascending segment.

Note that: 
1. The ﬂuid ﬂows into the medulla in the descend-
ing segment and out of the medulla in the ascending 
segment. 

2. The countercurrent ﬂow within the descending 
and ascending segments of the loop of Henle “multi-
plies” the osmotic gradient between the tubular ﬂuid 
in the descending and ascending segments. 

3.  A  hyperosmotic  interstitium  is  generated  by 
the reabsorption of NaCl in the ascending segment 
of the loop of Henle. This is an important step for 
the uriniferous tubule to excrete hyperosmotic urine 
with respect to plasma.  

4. The concentration of NaCl increases progres-
sively with increasing depth into the medulla. The 
highest concentration of NaCl is at the level of the 
papilla. This  medullary  gradient  results  from  the 
accumulation of NaCl reabsorbed by the process of 
countercurrent multiplication. 

5. The vasa recta transport nutrients and oxygen 
to the uriniferous tubules. They also remove excess 
water and solutes, continuously added by the counter-
current multiplication process. An increase in blood 
ﬂow through the vasa recta dissipates the medullary 
gradient. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Mechanism of action of 
diuretics
The  main  function  of  diuretics  is  to  increase  the 
excretion of Na+ by inhibiting Na+ reabsorption by 
the nephron. By this mechanism, Na+excretion takes 
water that is eliminated in urine.

The effect of diuretics depends on the volume of the 
extracellular ﬂuid (ECF) compartment and the effec-
tive circulating volume (ECV). If the ECV decreases, 
the  glomerular  ﬁltration  rate  (GFR)  decreases,  the 
load of ﬁltered Na+ is reduced, and the reabsorption 
of Na+ by the PCT increases.

With  these  events  in  mind,  you  realize  that  the 
action of diuretics acting on the DCT can be com-
promised by the presence of lower concentrations of 
Na+ when the ECV is reduced.

Figure 14-21 provides a summary of the mecha-
nism of action of osmotic diuretics, carbonic anhy-
drase inhibitors, loop diuretics, and thiazide diuretics.
Osmotic diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of water 
and solutes in the PCT and descending thin limb of 
the loop of Henle.

Carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  inhibit  Na+, 

Loop diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of NaCl in 
the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. About 
25% of the ﬁltered load of Na+ can be excreted by 
the action of loop diuretics.

Thiazide diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of NaCl 

in the DCT.

Essential concepts

Urinary System

• Functions of the urinary system: 
  (1) Filtration of the blood and excretion of 
waste metabolic products (from proteins, urea; 
from nucleic acids, uric acid; from muscle, cre-
atinine; from hemoglobin metabolism, urobilin, 
which gives urine its color). 
  (2) Regulation of water and electrolyte bal-
ance. 
  (3) Regulation of arterial blood pressure 
(by maintaining blood volume and producing 
renin, a key initiator of the angiotensin-aldoste-
rone cascade). 
  (4) Regulation of erythropoiesis (through 
erythropoietin, produced by renal interstitial 
cells). Chronic renal diseases are associated 
with anemia because of a decrease in the 
production of erythropoietin.
  (5) Production of active vitamin D.  

• Each kidneys consists of a cortex and a 
medulla. 
  The cortex is subdivided into outer cortex and 
juxtamedullary cortex. 
  The medulla is subdivided into outer medulla 
and inner medulla. 

• The organization of the renal vascular system 
is key for understanding the structure and 
function of the kidneys. 
  After entering the kidneys, the renal artery 
divides into interlobar arteries, running through 
the renal columns along the sides of the renal 
pyramids. At the corticomedullary junction, 
interlobar arteries change from a vertical to a 
horizontal direction to form the arcuate arter-
ies. Vertical branches of the arcuate arteries 
enter the renal cortex and become interlobular 

arteries. You are now ready to visualize the 
boundaries of a renal lobe and a renal lobule. 
  A renal lobe is a combined cortical- medul-
lary structure: It has a triangular shape, the 
medullary pyramid, formed by the outer 
and inner medullary regions. The triangle is 
capped by the corresponding cortex. 
  The base of the triangle is the renal capsule; 
the apex of the triangle is the papilla; the 
lateral boundaries are the renal columns (of 
Bertin), the site where interlobar arteries 
reside. A minor calyx collects urine dripping 
from the area cribrosa (perforated area) of 
each papilla. The area cribrosa is the opening 
site of multiple papillary ducts. 

A renal lobule resides in the cortex. It is  

deﬁned as the portion of the cortex between 
two adjacent interlobular arteries. The axis

of the lobule is occupied by a medullary ray 
(of Ferrein) consisting of a single collecting 
duct (of Bellini) receiving the ﬂuid of the cor-
reponding intralobular nephrons. As you can 
see, renal lobules are subcomponents of the 
renal lobes.

 
We continue our discussion with the renal 

vascular system. The vertical interlobular 
arteries that entered the cortex branch several 
times to form afferent arterioles. Each afferent 
arteriole forms a glomerular capillary that 
continues not as a venule, but as an efferent 
arteriole. This arteriolar-capillary-arteriolar ar-
rangement is called the glomerular or arterial 
portal system.
  One last and important point: The glomerular 
efferent arterioles give rise to two different 
vascular networks: 
  (1) A peritubular capillary network, derived 
from the efferent arterioles of cortical neph-
rons.  
  (2) The vasa recta (straight vessels), derived 
from the efferent arterioles of juxtamedul-
lary nephrons.  The vasa recta consists of a 
descending arteriolar-capillary component and 
an ascending capillary-venous component, 
alongside the descending and ascending 
limbs of the loops of Henle, respectively. This 
vascular-tubular arrangement is essential for 
understanding the countercurrent multiplier 
and exchange mechanism of urine formation.
 
• The uriniferous tubule consists of two com-

ponents of different embryologic origin:
  (1) The nephron.
  (2) The collecting tubule/duct. 
  The nephron consists of two components:
  (1) The renal corpuscle.
  (2) The renal tubule. 
  The renal corpuscle (of Malpighi) is formed 
by the capsule of Bowman investing the glo-
merular capillaries (the glomerulus). 
  The renal tubule consists of:
  (1) The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT).
  (2) The loop of Henle.
  (3) The distal convoluted tubule (DCT), 
which drains into the collecting tubule.
   The collecting tubule can be found in the 
cortex (cortical collecting tubules), the outer 
medulla (outer medullary collecting tubule), 
and inner medulla (inner medullary collecting 
tubule). 
  Depending on the distribution of renal 
corpuscles, nephrons can be either corti-
cal nephrons (with short loops of Henle) or 
juxtamedullary nephrons (with long loops of 
Henle).

The capsule of Bowman has two layers: 
(1) A parietal layer (simple squamous 

epithelium supported by a basement mem-
brane).

(2) A visceral layer attached to the wall 
of the glomerular capillaries. The visceral 
layer consists of branched epithelial cells, the 
podocytes. 

The space between the parietal and visceral 

layers of the capsule of Bowman is the urinary 
space or Bowman’s space. The urinary space 
is continuous with the lumen of the PCT, the 
initial segment of the renal tubule.  At this 
region, the urinary pole, the simple squamous 
epithelium of the parietal layer of the capsule 
of Bowman, becomes simple cuboidal with 
apical microvilli (brush border). This is the 
lining of the PCT.
  The glomerulus consists of three compo-
nents: 
  (1) The glomerular capillaries, lined by 
fenestrated endothelial cells.
  (2) The mesangium, consisting of mesangial 
cells producing the mesangial matrix.
  (3) The podocytes. 
  Note that renal corpuscle and glomerulus 
are not synonyms: A renal corpuscle includes 
the capsule of Bowman and the glomerulus. 
The designation glomerulus does not include 
the capsule of Bowman.
   Mesangial cells are embedded in an extra-
cellular matrix present between glomerular 
capillaries. Aggregates of mesangial cells can 
be seen outside the glomerulus (extraglo-
merular mesangial cells). Mesangial cells 
are pericyte-like cells with contractile and 
phagocytic properties. 
  Mesangial cells participate indirectly in 
glomerular ﬁltration by providing mechanical 
support to glomerular capillaries, turning over 
glomerular basal lamina components, and se-
creting vasoactive substances (prostaglandins 
and endothelins).

Essential concepts

• An understanding of the structure of the 
glomerular ﬁltration barrier is essential for 
grasping the clinical characteristics of protein-
uria syndromes. 
  The ﬁltration barrier has three components: 
  (1) The fenestrated endothelial cells of the 
glomerular capillaries.
  (2) The dual glomerular basal lamina (pro-
duced by endothelial cells and podocytes). It 
is known as glomerular basement membrane 
(GBM).
 (3) The podocytes, including a ﬁltration slit 
diaphragm between the interdigitating foot 
processes of podocytes.
  
• The podocyte ﬁltration slit diaphragm has 
a relevant role in glomerular ﬁltration. Defects 
in some of its protein components lead to 
hereditary proteinuria syndromes.
  The ﬁltration slit diaphragm is supported by 
intracellular F-actin present in pedicels, small 
podocyte cytoplasmic processes anchored to 
the dual basal lamina. 
  The C-terminal intracellular segment of the 
protein nephrin is attached to F-actin by podo-
cin, ZO-1, and CD2AP proteins. The N-terminal 
extracellular segment of nephrin interacts with 
another nephrin molecule (homophilic interac-
tion) extending from an adjacent pedicel to 
form the backbone of the slit diaphragm. 
   The nephrin gene is mutated in congenital 
nephrotic syndrome. Affected children display 
massive proteinuria and edema.
  Podocyte injury of congenital, hereditary, and 
acquired origin can cause glomerular diseases. 
Acquired glomerular diseases can be of im-
mune and non-immune origin. 
  Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an example 
of a congenital cause of podocyte injury.  
  Hereditary causes of podocyte injury include 
mutations in genes expressing podocyte-spe-
ciﬁc proteins (such as podocin and (cid:96)1 integrin 
subunit). The most characteristic feature is foot 
process effacement, the loss of interdigitating 
pedicels contacting the GBM.
  Most glomerular diseases caused by podo-
cyte injury are acquired, initiated by immune 
mechanisms (such as deposits of antibodies 
against glomerular components). Examples 
are membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (Berger’s 
disease).

• The GBM contains type IV collagen, a mol-
ecule directly involved in the pathogenesis of 
three renal diseases:
  (1) Goodpasture’s syndrome, an auto-
immune disorder consisting in progressive 
glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage 
caused by (cid:95)3 autoantibodies targeting the 
glomerular and alveolar basal lamina.
  (2) Alport’s syndrome, an inherited X-linked 
recessive nephropathy, predominant in males, 
and involving mutations of the (cid:95)5 chain gene.
Alport’s syndrome is associated with deafness 
and ocular symptoms, hematuria and progres-
sive glomerulonephritis leading to renal failure 
(end-stage renal disease, ESRD). 
  (3) Benign familial hematuria, caused by a 
dominant inherited mutation of the (cid:95)4 chain 

gene, which does not lead to renal failure as 
seen in ESRD.
• Glomerulonephritis deﬁnes an inﬂamma-
tory process of the renal corpuscle.

Antibody-antigen complexes circulating in 

blood trapped in the glomerular ﬁltration 
barrier contribute to glomerular damage. 
Antibody-antigen complexes are produced 
by autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus 
erythematosus) or bacterial and viral infections 
(streptococci and hepatitis B virus). 

 Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis 

observed in children is reversible. It is caused 
by proliferation of endothelial and mesangial 
cells in the presence of neutrophils. 

Rapid progressive (crescentic) glomeru-

lonephritis consists in proliferation of parietal 
cells of the capsule of Bowman and inﬁltra-
tion of macrophages forming a crescent-like 
mass within the glomerulus. This form of 
glomerulonephritis is observed in Goodpasture 
syndrome. 

 

• The juxtaglomerular apparatus consists of:
  (1) The macula densa, an Na+ sensor pres-
ent in the initial portion of the DCT.
  (2) The extraglomerular mesangial cells,  a 
supporting cushion of the macula densa locat-
ed at the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle.
  (3) The renin-producing juxtaglomerular cells, 
modiﬁed smooth muscle cells of the wall of 
the afferent arteriole. 

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is one of the 
components of the tubuloglomerular feedback 
mechanism participating in the autoregulation 
of renal blood ﬂow and glomerular ﬁltration.

• The PCT, a continuation of the urinary space 
(or Bowman’s capsular space), is the major 
reabsorption component of the nephron. 
  The PCT is lined by a simple cuboidal 
epithelium with well-developed apical micro-
villi (brush border) and tubulovesicles and 
lysosomes involved in the endocytosis and 
breakdown of peptides into amino acids. 
  A basolateral domain displays  plasma mem-
brane infoldings and interdigitations that lodge 
numerous mitochondria. Mitichondria provide 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for active ion 
transport mediated by an Na+, K+–activated 
ATPase pump. 
   A paracellular transport pathway (across tight 
junctions) mobilizes, by osmosis, water into 
the lateral intercellular space. A transcellular 
transport pathway is involved in the reabsorp-
tion of solutes such as NaCl, peptides, and 
glucose. 
   Fanconi syndrome is a renal hereditary 
(primary) or acquired (secondary) disease 
in which amino acids and glucose are not 
reabsorbed and are found in urine. The cause 
appears to be a defect in the cellular energy 
metabolism decreasing the levels of ATP by 
the impaired activity of the Na+, K+–ATPase 
pump.
  
• The loop of Henle consists of a descending 
limb and an ascending limb. 
  Each limb is formed by a thick segment 
(lined by simple cuboidal epithelium) and a 

thin segment (lined by simple squamous 
epithelium).
  The descending thick segment is a continu-
ation of the proximal convoluted tubule. The 
ascending thick segment is continuous with 
the distal convoluted tubule. 
  The U-shaped thin segment forms most of 
the loop in juxtamedullary nephrons deep in 
the medulla. Recall that the loop of Henle of 
cortical nephrons penetrates up to the outer 
medulla.

• The DCT is lined by a simple cuboidal 
epithelium with a less developed apical 
brush border when compared with the lining 
epithelium of the PCT. Tubulovesicles and ly-
sosomes are less prominent. The basolateral 
domain is infolded and  mitochondria are 
abundant at this location. 
  A distinctive structure is the macula densa, 
a cluster of cells located at the junction of 
the ascending thick segment of the loop of 
Henle with the DCT. The macula densa faces 
the extraglomerular mesangial cells and is 
part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. 

It is important to remember for histologic 

identiﬁcation purposes that both PCT and 
DCT are adjacent to the renal corpuscle.  

 

• The collecting tubules (also called ducts) 
originate in the cortical medullary rays. 
Remember that a medullary ray is the axis 
of a renal lobule, a cortical subdivision 
bordered laterally by adjacent interlobular 
arteries, branches of the arcuate artery. Corti-
cal medullary rays join others to form wider 
papillary ducts in the papilla. Papillary ducts 
open on the surface of the papilla forming a 
perforated area cribrosa. 
   The lining epithelium is simple cuboidal. 
The outline of the epithelial cells is very 
distinct. The epithelium consists of two cell 
types: 
  (1) Principal cells, light cells with an apical 
nonmotile primary cilium.
 (2) Intercalated cells, dark cells with apical 
microvilli and abundant mitochondria. 
  Principal cells respond to aldosterone, a 
mineralocorticoid produced by cells of the 
zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. 
   The apical nonmotile primary cilium of 
principal cells is a mechanosensor receiv-
ing signals from the ﬂuid contents in the 
tubular lumen. Ciliary bending by ﬂuid ﬂow or 
mechanical stimulation induce Ca2+ release 
from intracellular storage sites. The ciliary 
plasma membrane contains the polycystin-1/
polycystin-2 protein complex. Polycystin-2 
acts as a Ca2+-permeable channel.
   Autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys 
disease (ADPKD) results from mutations in 
either two genes: PKD1, encoding polycys-
tin-1, or PKD2, encoding polycystin-2. Ex-
tensive cystic enlargement of both kidneyss 
results from a complete loss of PKD1 or 
PKD2 gene expression. Blood hypertension 
preceding progressive renal failure is ob-
served in patients with ADPKD. Renal dialysis 
and renal transplantation are the indicated 
treatments.

• Renal interstitial cells, mainly ﬁbroblasts and 
dendritic cells, can be found in the renal cortex 
and medulla. 
There are two populations of interstitial cells: 
  (1) Renal cortical ﬁbroblasts.
  (2) Renal medullary ﬁbroblasts. 
  Cortical ﬁbroblasts predominate in the juxta-
medullary cortex and produce erythropoietin. 
Synthetic erythropoietin is used in the treat-
ment of anemia resulting from chronic renal 
failure or cancer chemotherapy. 
  Medullary ﬁbroblasts are arranged in a 
ladder-like fashion and contain lipid droplets in 
the cytoplasm. They produce glycosaminogly-
cans and vasoactive prostaglandin E2 that may 
regulate papillary blood ﬂow. 
  Activated dendritic cells, expressing class II 
major histocompatibility antigen, and inﬂam-
matory cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) 
participate in interstitial nephritis (tubulointer-
stitial disease) caused by nephrotoxic drugs 
(such as heavy metals or hypersensitivity to 
penicillin) or by an immunologic mechanism 
(for example, lupus erythematosus).

• The excretory passages of urine include:
  (1) The renal calyces and pelvis.
  (2) Ureters.
  (3) Urinary bladder, lined by a transitional  
epithelium (urothelium) supported by a 
lamina propria and surrounded by spiral and 
longitudinally arranged layers of smooth 
muscle. 
  (4) The male urethra consists of three seg-
ments: prostatic urethra (lined by transitional 
epithelium), membranous urethra, and penile 
urethra (both lined by pseudostratiﬁed-to-strat-
iﬁed columnar epithelium. The penile urethra 
is surrounded by the corpus spongiosum. 
  The female urethra is lined sequentially by a 
columnar pseudostratiﬁed to stratiﬁed squa-
mous epithelium to low keratinized stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. The wall of the female 
urethra consists of an inner smooth muscle 
layer surrounded by an external striated 
muscle layer.

• The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is 
essential for the maintenance of systemic 
blood pressure when there is a reduction in 
the blood volume or pressure. The system 
is triggered by a tubuloglomerular feedback 

mechanism originating in the juxtaglomerular 
apparatus: 
  (1) The tubular component is the Na+-sens-
ing macula densa.
  (2) The glomerular component is the renin-
producing juxtaglomerular cells. 
  The immediate objectives of the tubulo-
glomerular feedback mechanism are the 
regulation of the glomerular ﬁltration rate (by 
controlling afferent and efferent arteriolar 
resistance; remember the glomerular arterial 
portal arrangement already discussed) and the 
release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells to 
produce angiotensin II.
  The major steps leading to the production of 
angiotensin II and its activities are:
  (1) Renin converts angiotensinogen (AGT, 
produced in hepatocytes) to angiotensin I 
(ANGI).  
  (2) Angotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, 
produced by pulmonary and renal endothelial 
cells) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II 
(ANGII).
  (3) ANG II has several important functions: 
  • It stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by 
the adrenal cortex. 
  • It causes vasoconstriction, which, in turn, 
increases blood pressure. ANG II binds to ANG 
II receptor type 1 (AT1R). ANG II receptor 
blockers (ARB) are extensively used in the 
clinic to regulate elevated blood pressure.
  • It enhances the reabsorption of NaCl by the 
PCT of the nephron. 
  • It stimulates ADH release.
  An activated RAS is a major risk factor of  
cardiovascular and renal disease. Inhibitors of 
RAS (renin and ACE inhibitors and ARB ) are 
extensively used in the clinic. 

• The loop of Henle creates an osmotic gradi-
ent causing water to ﬂow out the collecting 
tubule into the surrounding interstitial tissue.
  A countercurrent multiplication in the loop 
of Henle maintains high solute concentration 
in the renal medulla.
  Countercurrent multiplication occurs because:  
  (1) The thin descending segment of the loop 
of Henle is permeable to water but has low 
permeability to salt.
  (2) The thin ascending segment is perme-
able to salt but not to water.
  (3) The thick ascending segment reabsorbs 

salt by active transport and is impermeable 
to water. 
  As you can see, countercurrent multiplication 
results in increasing salt concentration in the 
medullary interstitium with the descent of the 
loop of Henle segment. When ADH increases 
water permeability of the collecting duct, 
water can ﬂow down its osmotic gradient into 
the salty medullary interstitium. Water and 
some salt must ﬁnd their way back from the 
salty interstitium to the bloodstream to reduce 
plasma osmolality. 
  The parallel arrangement of the vasa recta 
with the U-shaped loop of Henle enables the 
absorption of solute and water by counter-
current exchange:
  (1) The arterial descending segment of the 
vasa recta absorbs some salt.
  (2) The venous ascending segment of the 
vasa recta reabsorbs water. 

In this way, the loop of Henle–dependent 

countercurrent multiplication does not ac-
cumulate salt and water indeﬁnitely in the 
interstitium with the help of the vasa recta–
dependent countercurrent exchange.

• Diuretics are drugs that increase the output 
of urine (diuresis) by acting on speciﬁc 
membrane transport proteins. Inhibition of 
Na+ resorption by the nephron leads to an 
increase in the excretion of Na+ (natriuresis) 
and water.
  Diuretics are used as adjunctive therapy in 
edema associated with congestive heart fail-
ure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal dysfunction 
(nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephri-
tis, and chronic renal failure). They are used to  
treat hypertension and open-angle glaucoma.
  There are different types of diuretics:
  (1) Osmotic diuretics inhibit the reabsorp-
tion of water and solutes in the PCT and 
descending thin limb of the loop of Henle.
  (2) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors prevent 
Na+, HCO3–, and water reabsorption in the 
PCT.
  (3) Loop diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of 
NaCl in the thick ascending limb of the loop 
of Henle. About 25% of the ﬁltered load of 
Na+ can be excreted by the action of loop 
diuretics. 
  (4) Thiazide diuretics inhibit the reabsorption 
of NaCl in the DCT.

15. Upper Digestive Segment

Swallowing, digestion, and absorption take place through the digestive or alimentary tube, a 7- to 10-meter hol-
low muscular conduit. The digestive process converts food material into a soluble form easy to absorb by the 
small intestine. The elimination of insoluble residues and other materials is the function of the large intestine.
Histologically, the digestive tube consists of four major layers: (1) an inner mucosal layer encircling the lumen, 
(2) a submucosal layer, (3) a muscularis externa layer, and (4) a serosal/adventitial layer. The inner mucosal 
layer shows signiﬁcant variations along the digestive tube. It is subdivided into three components: (1) an epi-
thelial layer, (2) a connective tissue lamina propria, and (3) a smooth muscle muscularis mucosae. This chapter 
focuses on the histologic features of the oral cavity, the esophagus, and the stomach with a particular emphasis 
on the mechanisms that affect the function of these speciﬁc segments of the alimentary system.

Mouth, or oral cavity
The oral cavity is the entrance to the digestive tube  
and  the  oral  epithelium,  including  aggregates  of 
lymphoid tissue. It represents the primary barrier to 
pathogens. Ingestion, partial digestion, and lubri-
cation of the food, or bolus, are the main functions 
of the mouth and its associated salivary glands.  We 
study the salivary glands in Chapter 17, Digestive 
Glands.

The mouth, or oral cavity, includes the lips, cheeks, 
teeth, gums (gingivae), tongue, uvula, and palate. The 
various regions of the oral cavity are lined by three 
types of mucosae with structural variations: 

1. Lining mucosa (lips, cheeks, ventral surface of the 
tongue, soft palate, mouth ﬂoor, and alveolar mucosa).

2. Masticatory mucosa (gingiva and hard palate).
3.  Specialized  mucosa  (dorsal  surface  of  the 

tongue).

There are three transition sites of the oral mucosa:
1. The mucocutaneous junction (between the skin 

and the mucosa of the lips).

2.   The  mucogingival  junction  (between  the 
gingiva and alveolar mucosa), involving a transition 
from the keratinized stratiﬁed squamous epithelium 
of the gingiva, ﬁrmly attached to the periosteum by 
collagen bundles, to the nonkeratinized epithelium 
of the alveolar mucosa, supported by a loose lamina 
propria with elastic ﬁbers. 

3. The dentogingival junction (between the mu-
cosa of the gingiva and the enamel of the tooth), a

    Except  for  the  teeth,  the  mouth  is  lined  by  a 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium, with a submucosa, 
consisting of loose connective tissue, blood vessels 
and nerves, present only in certain regions (cheeks, 
lips and part of the hard palate). In some regions, 
such as the gingiva and parts of the hard palate, the 
oral mucosa is ﬁrmly attached to the periosteum of 
the subjacent bone, an arrangement called mucoperi-
osteum. The oral mucosa lacks a muscularis mucosa.

Lips
The lips consist of three regions: 

1. The cutaneous region.
2. The red or vermilion region.
3. The oral mucosa region.
The cutaneous region is covered by thin skin with 
tall dermal papillae (keratinized stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium  with  hair  follicles  and  sebaceous  and 
sweat glands). The red or vermilion region is lined 
by  a  stratiﬁed  squamous  epithelium  supported  by

connective tissue containing blood vessels responsible 
for the red color of this region. 

Note  in  Figure  15-1  that  no  salivary  glands  are 
present in the mucosa of the vermilion region. This 
region drys out and becomes cracked in cold weather. 
A sharp vermilion border separates the skin from the 
vermilion region. 

The oral mucosa region, that is continuous with 
the mucosa of the cheeks and gums, displays minor 
salivary glands. The muscle tissue seen in Figure 15-1 
is the orbicularis oris. 

The stratiﬁed squamous epithelium covering the 
inner surface of the lips and cheeks is nonkeratinized 
and  supported  by  a  dense  lamina  propria  (lining 
mucosa) and a submucosa, closely bound by connec-
tive tissue ﬁbers to the underlying skeletal muscles.

Gingiva, hard, and soft palate  
Masticatory  mucosa  covers  the  hard  palate  and 
gingivae and sustains abrasion during food mastica-
tion. The gums, or gingivae, are similar to the red 
region of the lips, except on the free margin, where 
signiﬁcant keratinization is seen. The lamina propria 
of the gums binds tightly to the periosteum of the 
alveolar processes of the maxillae and mandible and 
to the periodontal membrane.  The gums lack sub-
mucosa or glands.

The hard palate is lined by a keratinizing strati-
ﬁed squamous epithelium similar to that of the free 
margins of the gums. A submucosa is present in the 
midline but absent in the area adjacent to the gums. 
Collagenous ﬁbers in the submucosa bind the mu-
cosa  to the periosteum of the hard palate, enabling 
the mucosa to resists shear forces and compression. 
Areas of fat and glandular tissue cushion the mucosa 
to protect nerves and blood vessels of the hard palate.
The soft palate and uvula are lined by a nonkera-
tinized stratiﬁed squamous epithelium extending into 
the oropharynx where it becomes continuous with 
the pseudostratiﬁed ciliated columnar epithelium of 
the upper respiratory tract. The submucosa is loose 
and contains abundant mucous and serous glands. 
Skeletal muscle ﬁbers are present in the soft palate 
and uvula.

Tongue
The anterior two thirds of the tongue consist of a core 
mass of skeletal muscle oriented in three directions: 
longitudinal, transverse, and oblique. The posterior 
one third displays aggregations of lymphatic tissue, 
the lingual tonsils.

The dorsal surface of the tongue is covered by a 
specialized mucosa consisting of a nonkeratinized 
stratified  squamous  epithelium  supported  by  a 
lamina  propria  associated  with  the  muscle  core  of 

the tongue. Serous and mucous glands extend across 
the lamina propria and the muscle. Their ducts open 
into the crypts and furrows of the lingual tonsils and 
circumvallate papillae, respectively.

The dorsal surface of the tongue contains numerous 
mucosal projections called lingual papillae (Figure 
15-2).  Each lingual papilla is formed by a highly 
vascular connective tissue core and a covering layer 
of stratiﬁed squamous epithelium. 

According to their shape, lingual papillae can be 

divided into four types: 

1.  Filiform  papillae  (narrow  conical),  the  most 

abundant.

2. Fungiform papillae (mushroom-shaped).
3. Circumvallate papillae (wall-like).
4. Foliate papillae (leaf-shaped), rudimentary in 
humans but well developed in rabbits and monkeys.
Taste buds are found in all lingual papillae except 
the  ﬁliform  papillae. Taste  buds  are  barrel-shaped 
epithelial  structures  containing  chemosensory  cells 
called  gustatory  receptor  cells.  Gustatory  receptor 
cells are in synaptic contact with the terminals of the 
gustatory nerves. 

Circumvallate papillae are located in the posterior 
part of the tongue, aligned in front of the sulcus ter-
minalis. The circumvallate papilla occupies a recess 
in the mucosa and, therefore, it is surrounded by a 
circular furrow or trench. 

Serous glands, or Ebner’s glands,  in the connec-
tive  tissue,  in  contact  with  the  underlying  muscle, 
are  associated  with  the  circumvallate  papilla.  The 
ducts of Ebner’s glands open into the ﬂoor of the 
circular furrow.  

The sides of the circumvallate papilla and the fac-
ing wall of furrow contain several taste buds. Each 
taste bud, depending on the species, consists of 50 
to 150 cells, with its narrow apical ends extending 
into a taste pore. 

A  taste  bud  has  three  cell  components  (Figure 

15-3): 

1. Taste receptor cells.
2. Supporting cells (or immature taste cells).
3. Precursor cells (or basal cells).
Taste receptor cells have a life span of 10 to 14 
days. Precursor cells give rise to supporting cells (or 
immature taste cells) which, in turn, become mature 
taste receptor cells. The basal portion of a taste recep-
tor cell makes contact with an afferent nerve terminal 
derived from neurons in the sensory ganglia of the 
facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves. 

Sweet, sour, bitter, and salty are the four classic 
taste  sensations.  A  ﬁfth  taste  is  umami  (the  taste 
enhanced by monosodium glutamate). 

A speciﬁc taste sensation is generated by speciﬁc

that activate gustatory afferent nerve terminals.

Taste bud 

taste receptor cells. The facial nerve carries the ﬁve 
taste sensations; the glossopharyngeal nerve carries 
sweet and bitter sensations.

 When a sweet tastant diffuses through the taste 
pore of a taste bud, it interacts with  type 1 recep-
tors (designated T1R) present in the apical micro-
villi of the taste receptor cells. Taste receptors can 
form  heterodimers  (T1R2+T1R3)  or  homodimers 
(T1R3+T1R3). 

T1Rs  are  linked  to  the  G-protein  (cid:95),  (cid:96),  and  (cid:97) 
subunit complex, called gustducin (see Figure 15-3). 
Binding of the (cid:95) subunit of the G-protein complex 
to phospholipase C (PLC) triggers the production 
of the second messengers inositol triphosphate (IP3) 
and diacylglycerol (DAG) that activate ion channels 
in the taste receptor cells.

An inﬂux of Na+ within taste cells causes depo-
larization of the taste receptor cells. An increase in 
intracellular Ca2+, released from intracellular storage 
sites, triggers the release into the extracellular space 
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and neurotrans-
mitters at the synapses with gustatory afferent nerve 
terminals.

In  summary,  taste  receptor  cells  can  detect  and 
discriminate sweet, bitter or umami tastants by cell 
depolarization, gustducin–dependent Ca2+ and Na+
signaling and release of ATP and neurotransmitters.
The salty taste of Na+ is detected by direct inﬂux of
Na+ through membrane ion channels to depolarize 
the  plasma  membrane.  Some  taste  receptor  cells 
respond  to  only  one  of  the  basic  taste  substances. 
Others are sensitive to more than one taste substance.

Tooth
In  the  adult  human,  dentition  consists  of  32  per-
manent  teeth. The  16  upper  teeth  are  embedded 
in alveolar processes of the maxilla. The lower 16 
teeth are  embedded in similar alveolar processes of 
the mandible. 

The permanent dentition is preceded by a set of 
20 deciduous teeth, also called milk or baby teeth. 
Deciduous teeth appear at about 6 months of age 
and the entire set is present by age 6 to 8 years. The 
deciduous teeth are replaced between ages 10 and 12 
by the 32 permanent teeth. This replacement process 
ends at about age 18.

Each  of  the  several  types  of  teeth  has  a  distinc-
tive shape and function: incisors  are specialized for 
cutting; canines, for puncturing and holding; and 
molars, for crushing.

Each tooth consists of a crown and either single or 
multiple roots (Figure 15-4). The crown is covered 
by highly calciﬁed layers of enamel and dentin. The 
outer surface of the root is covered by another calci-
ﬁed tissue called cementum. 

The dentin forms the bulk of the tooth and con-

tains a central chamber ﬁlled with soft tissue, the pulp. 
The pulp chamber opens at the apical foramen  into 
the bony alveolar process by the root canal. Blood 
vessels, nerves, and lymphatics enter and leave the 
pulp chamber through the apical foramen. Myelin-
ated nerve ﬁbers run along with the blood vessels.

Tooth development
The ectoderm, cranial neural crest, and mesenchyme 
contribute to the development of the tooth (Figure 
15-5).  Ameloblasts  derive  from  the  ectoderm. 
Odontoblasts derive from the cranial neural crest. 
Cementocytes derive from the mesenchyme.

Secreted signaling molecules, activin (cid:96)A, ﬁbroblast 
growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins, 
mediate the interaction between the dental epithelium 
and the mesenchyme during tooth morphogenesis. 
Figure  15-5  illustrates  the  relevant  steps  of  tooth 
development.

Odontoblasts 
Odontoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal cells 
of the dental papilla under the control of the inner 
enamel epithelium. The dental papilla becomes the 
dental pulp (see Figure 15-5). 

A layer of odontoblasts is present at the periphery 
of the dental pulp in the adult tooth (Figure 15-6). 
Odontoblasts are active secretory cells that synthesize 
and secrete type I collagen and noncollagenous mate-
rial, the organic components of the dentin.

The odontoblast is a columnar epithelial-like cell 
located at the inner side of the dentin, in the pulp 
cavity (see Figure 15-6). 

The apical cell domain is embedded in predentin, 
a nonmineralized layer of dentin-like material. The 
apical  domain  projects  a  main  apical  cell  process 
that  becomes  enclosed  within  a  canalicular  system  
just above the junctional complexes linking adjacent 
odontoblasts.

A  well-developed  rough  endoplasmic  reticulum 
and  Golgi  apparatus  as  well  as  secretory  granules 
are  found  in  the  apical  region  of  the  odontoblast. 
The secretory granules contain procollagen. When 
procollagen  is  released  from  the  odontoblast,  it  is 
enzymatically processed to tropocollagen, which ag-
gregates into type I collagen ﬁbrils.

Predentin  is  the  layer  of  dentin  adjacent  to  the 
odontoblast  cell  body  and  processes.  Predentin  is 
nonmineralized and consists mainly of collagen ﬁbrils 
that will become covered (mineralized) by hydroxy-
apatite crystals in the dentin region. A demarcation 
mineralization front separates predentin from dentin. 
Dentin consists of 20% organic material, mainly 
type  I  collagen;  70%  inorganic  material,  mainly 
crystals  of  hydroxyapatite  and  ﬂuoroapatite;  and 
10% water.

ectomesenchymal cells of the dental pulp 
to differentiate into dentin–producing 
odontoblasts.
   Dental follicle cells differentiate into 
cementum–producing cementoblasts and 
type I collagen–producing fibroblasts of 
the periodontal ligament. HERS cells can 
also transform into cementoblasts.  

Coronal dentin dysplasia (also known as dentin 
dysplasia, type II) is a rare inherited autosomal defect 
characterized by abnormal development of dentin, 
extremely short roots (rootless teeth), and obliterated 
pulp chambers.

Dental pulp 
The  dental  pulp  consists  of  blood  vessels,  nerves, 
and  lymphatics  surrounded  by  fibroblasts  and 
mesenchyme-like extracellular elements. Blood ves-
sels (arterioles) branch into a capillary network that,

Neuroectodermal 
cells induce the 
overlying ectodermic 
epithelial cells to 
proliferate and form  
the epithelial tooth 
bud. There are  20 
buds, one for each of 
the deciduous teeth.

The dental lamina connects the 
downward-growing cells with the ectodermal 
epithelium. 
   The cells at the growing end of the dental bud 
form a caplike structure. The epithelial tooth bud 
is lined by an outer and inner dental epithelium.  
   The bud of the permanent tooth develops from 
the dental lamina and remains dormant. The 
enamel knot signals tooth development.

At the enamel knot site, the 
outermost cells of the dental papilla 
differentiate into dentin-producing 
odontoblasts. A single layer of 
enamel-secreting ameloblasts 
develops in the inner dental 
epithelium portion of the enamel 
knot.

Tooth development proceeds in three morphologic 
stages: bud, cup, and bell. The primordium is 
called dental or enamel organ.
     The earliest indication of tooth development is 
at day 11 of embryogenesis. The formation of 
ectodermal placodes (local thickenings of the 
oral epithelium of the first branchial arch) marks 
the initiation site. Neural crest and mesenchymal 
cells, forming the ectomesenchyme, have 
odontogenic potential.
    The first genes to be expressed in the oral 
epithelium encode the transcription factors 
Lhx-6 and Lhx-7 (Lim-homeobox domain genes). 
Expression of several genes in the 
ectomesenchyme marks the sites of tooth 
initiation.
    Ectodermal dysplasias, affecting the 
development of ectodermal placodes, cause 
multiple missing teeth (oligodontia) and small 
misshapen teeth.

Predentin

A dentinal tube contains the odontoblast apical process. The 
walls of the tube are formed by aligned collagen fibers. At the end 
of the tube, the bifurcated ends extend into the enamel. 

Dentin consists of 20% organic material, mainly type I collagen; 
70% inorganic material, mainly crystals of hydroxyapatite and 
fluoroapatite; and 10% water.

Predentin is the nonmineralized zone surrounding the apical 
processes of the odontoblast. It contains type I collagen 
resulting from the released procollagen processed into 
tropocollagen. Tropocollagen molecules polymerize to produce 
the type I collagen fibers of predentin.

together with nerves, form a neurovascular bundle 
beneath the basal cell domain of the odontoblasts in 
a cell-free zone (of Weil) of the dental pulp. 

An inﬂammation in the pulp causes swelling and 
pain. Because there is no space for swelling in the pulp 
cavity, the blood supply is suppressed by compression, 
leading rapidly to the death of the pulp cells.

 Pulp stones are single or multiple calciﬁed deposits 
found in the dental pulp, close to the oriﬁce of the 
pulp chamber or within the root canals. Pulp stones  
reduce the number of cells within the dental pulp 

and interfere with the enlargement of the root canal 
during endodontic treatment.

Periodontium
The periodontium supports and surrounds the 
tooth. It consists of the following components:

1. Cementum.
2. Periodontal ligament.
3. Bone of the alveolus or socket.
4. The sulcus epithelium, part of the gingiva fac-

ing the tooth.

  The cementum is an avascular bonelike mineralized 
tissue  covering  the  outer  surface  of  the  root.  Like 
bone, the cementum consists of calciﬁed collagenous 
ﬁbrils and trapped osteocyte-like cells called cemen-
tocytes. Note that the tooth has three mineralized 
components: enamel, dentin and cementum. 

The cementum meets the enamel at the cemen-
toenamel junction and separates the crown from the 
root at the neck region of the tooth. The outermost 
layer of the cementum is uncalciﬁed and is produced 
by  cementoblasts  in  contact  with  the  periodontal 
ligament, a collagen- and ﬁbroblast-rich and vascular-
ized  suspensory ligament holding the tooth in the 
sockets of the alveolar bone (see Figure 15-4). The

strength of the periodontal ligament ﬁbers gives teeth 
mobility and strong bone attachment, both useful in 
orthodontic treatment.

Ameloblasts 
Ameloblasts are enamel-producing cells present only 
during tooth development. Ameloblasts are no longer 
present following tooth eruption.

The ameloblast (Figure 15-7) is a polarized colum-
nar cell with mitochondria and a nucleus present in 
the basal region of  the cell.  The supranuclear region 
contains numerous cisternae of rough endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

tiguous  ameloblasts,  the  apical  domain  displays  a 
broad cell extension, Tomes’ process, in proximity 
to the calciﬁed enamel matrix. Tomes’ processes are 
fully  developed  during  the  secretory  stage  of  the 
ameloblast. They have abundant secretory granules 
containing glycoproteins that regulate the nucleation 
of carbonated apatite crystals, growth and organiza-
tion of the enamel. 

Electron microscopic examination shows that the 
basic building units of the enamel matrix are thin un-
dulated enamel rods separated by an interrod region 
with a structure similar to that of the enamel rods 
but with its crystals oriented in a different direction. 
Each rod is coated with a thin layer of organic matrix, 
called the rod sheath (see Figure 15-7).

The enamel is the hardest substance found in the 
body. About 95% of the enamel is composed of crys-
tals of hydroxyapatite (carbonated hydroxyapatite); 
less than 5% is protein and water. The high mineral 
content  is  responsible  for  the  extreme  hardness  of 
enamel, a property that enables enamel to withstand 
mechanical force during mastication. The underly-
ing layer of dentin is more resilient and protects the 
structural integrity of enamel. 

The newly secreted enamel has a high content of 
protein (about 30%), whose concentration decreases 
to 1% during enamel mineralization. The extracel-
lular matrix of the developing enamel (amelogenesis) 
contains two classes of proteins: amelogenin (90%) 
and  nonamelogenins  (10%),  including  enamelin 
and ameloblastin.

Amelogenin  (25  kd)  is  the  major  constituent, 
unique  to  the  developing  enamel.  It  controls  the 
calciﬁcation  of  the  enamel.  Enamelin  and  amelo-
blastin are minor components. A 32 kd proteolytic 
fragment of enamelin (186 kd) has strong afﬁnity 
to adsorb enamel crystals. Ameloblastin (70 kd) has 
calcium–binding properties.

Dental caries develop when the supportive layer 
of  dentin  is  destroyed  and  hydroxyapatite  of  the 
enamel dissolves.   

Amelogenesis imperfecta is an X chromosome–
linked  inherited  disease  affecting  the  synthesis  of 
amelogenin required for the formation of the tooth 
enamel; affected enamel does not attain its normal 
thickness, hardness, and color. Autosomal-dominant 
amelogenesis imperfecta is caused by a mutation of 
the enamelin gene. 

Pathology: Non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions 
of the oral mucosa
Non-neoplastic lesions of the oral mucosa include:
1. Reactive ﬁbroepithelial hyperplasia following 
traumatic injury or irritation of the gingiva and palate 
caused by dentures. 

2. Herpes simplex viral infection can cause ulcer-

ation of the gingiva and palate. Verrucous papillary 
lesions of the oral mucosa are seen in human papil-
lomavirus infection. 

3. Hairy (papillate) leukoplakia in the lateral mar-
gins of the tongue occurs in HIV-positive patients and 
in individual with immuno-suppressed conditions as 
opportunistic Epstein-Barr viral infection. Koilocyto-
sis (perinuclear halo) in cells of the stratum spinosum 
of the stratiﬁed squamous epithelium and intranuclear 
viral inclusions are characteristic.

Neoplastic lesions of the oral mucosa include:
1.  Squamous  cell  carcinoma  represents  the  pre-
dominant  oral  malignant  condition  seen  in  adults 
with predominant localizations in the lateral tongue 
and the ﬂoor of the mouth. Squamous cell carcinoma  
generally starts from a dysplasia, in situ carcinoma or 
a proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (a white patch 
or plaque that cannot be rubbed off). 

2. Oral melanomas are generally localized in palate 
and gingiva and can be in situ or multiple invasive 
lesions  with  irregular  borders  and  ulcerated.  Most 
melanomas are detected in advanced stages. 

3. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are observed in the 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (Waldeyer’s ring) 
in patients with HIV-infection. Epstein-Barr virus is 
frequently detected in the lesions. 

4. Kaposi’s sarcoma is seen in palate and gingiva in 
the form of macular or nodular lesions, in association 
with  cutaneous  localization. The  lesion  consists  in 
the  proliferation of endothelial cells of blood vessels.  
Vascular spaces are lined by elongated cells expressing 
CD34 antigen and with moderate nuclear atypia. A 
clinical correlation exists with HIV infection.

5. Neural tumors include schwannoma, an encap-
sulated  tumor  containing  Schwann  cells;  single  or 
multiple neuroﬁbromas, also consisting of Schwann 
cells  but  not  limited  by  a  capsule;  and  traumatic 
neuroma, usually present in the tongue.  

General organization of the digestive tube
Although  we  study  each  segment  of  the  digestive 
or  alimentary  tube  separately,  it  is  important  to 
discuss ﬁrst the general organization of the tube to 
understand that each segment does not function as 
an independent unit.

We start with the general histologic features of the 
digestive tube by indicating that, except for the oral 
cavity,  the  digestive  tube  has  a  uniform  histologic  
organization. 

This organization is characterized by distinct and 
signiﬁcant structural variations reﬂecting changes in 
functional activity. 

After the oral cavity, the digestive tube is differen-
tiated into four major organs: esophagus, stomach, 
small  intestine,  and  large  intestine.  Each  of  these

organs is made up of four concentric layers (Figure 
15-8): 

1. The mucosa.
2. The submucosa.
3. The muscularis.
4. The adventitia, or serosa.
 The mucosa has three components:  
1. A lining epithelium.
2. An underlying lamina propria consisting of a 

vascularized loose connective tissue.

3. A thin layer of smooth muscle, the muscularis 

mucosae.

Lymphatic  nodules  and  scattered  immunocom-
petent  cells  (lymphocytes,  plasma  cells,  and  mac-
rophages)  are  present  in  the    lamina  propria. The 
lamina propria of the small and large intestines is a 
relevant site of immune responses (see  Chapter 16, 
Lower Digestive Segment).

The lining epithelium invaginates to form glands, 
extending into the lamina propria (mucosal glands) 
or  submucosa  (submucosal  glands),  and  ducts, 
transporting secretions from the liver and pancreas 
through the wall of the digestive tube (duodenum) 
into its lumen. 

In  the  stomach  and  small  intestine,  both  the 
mucosa  and  submucosa  extend  into  the  lumen  as 
folds, called rugae and plicae, respectively.  In other 
instances, the mucosa alone extends into the lumen 

as  ﬁnger-like  projections,  or  villi.  Mucosal  glands 
increase the secretory capacity, whereas villi increase 
the absorptive capacity of the digestive tube.

The mucosa shows signiﬁcant variations from seg-
ment to segment of the digestive tract. The submucosa 
consists of a dense irregular connective tissue with 
large blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching 
into the mucosa and muscularis. Glands are present 
in the submucosa of  the esophagus and duodenum.
The  muscularis  contains  two  layers  of  smooth 
muscle: the smooth muscle ﬁbers of the inner layer 
are arranged around the tube lumen (circular layer); 
ﬁbers of the outer layer are disposed along the tube 
(longitudinal layer). Contraction of the smooth ﬁbers 
of the circular layer reduces the lumen; contraction 
of the ﬁbers of the longitudinal layer shortens the 
tube. Skeletal muscle ﬁbers are present in the upper 
esophagus and the anal sphincter.

The  adventitia  of  the  digestive  tube  consists  of 
loose connective tissue. When the digestive tube is 
suspended by the mesentery or peritoneal fold, the 
adventitia is covered by a mesothelium (simple squa-
mous epithelium) forming a serosa, or serous mem-
brane. An exception is the esophagus, surrounded by 
the adipose tissue of the mediastinum.

Microvasculature of the digestive tube

of the stomach. The microcirculation of the small

Clinical significance
Gastric microcirculation is relevant to the pathogenesis of 
peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and the protection of the gastric 
mucosa from the action of hydrochloric acid and pepsin.

1
         Gastric arteries form a subserosal plexus 
that links to the intramuscular plexus.

2
         The highly developed intramuscular plexus 
supplies branches to the submucosal plexus and 
the layers of the muscularis.

3
         The  submucosal plexus supplies arterioles 
to the mucosa.

         Arterioles become fenestrated capillaries

within the gastric mucosa and around the glands. 
Periglandular capillary beds anastomose with 
each other.

submucosal venules of the submucosal venous 
plexus.

intestine and differences from the gastric microcircu-
lation are discussed in Chapter 16, Lower Digestive 
Segment (see Figure 16-3).  

Blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves reach the 
walls of the digestive tube through the supporting 
mesentery or the surrounding tissues. After entering 
the walls of the stomach, arteries organize three arte-
rial networks (Figure 15-9): 
1. The subserosal plexus.
2. The intramuscularis plexus.
3. The submucosal plexus. 
Some  branches  from  the  plexuses  run  longitu-
dinally  in  the  muscularis  and  submucosa;  other 
branches  extend  perpendicularly  into  the  mucosa 
and muscularis.  

In the mucosa, arterioles derived from the submu-
cosal plexus supply a bed of fenestrated capillaries 
around the gastric glands and anastomose laterally 
with each other. As discussed later, the fenestrated 
nature  of  the  capillaries  facilitates  bicarbonate  de-
livery to protect the surface epithelial cells against 
hydrochloric acid damage (see Figure 15-18).  

Collecting venules descend from the mucosa into 
the  submucosa  as  veins,  leave  the  digestive  tube 

through  the  mesentery,  and  drain  into  the  splenic 
and superior mesenteric veins. Mesenteric veins drain 
into the portal vein, leading to the  liver (see Chapter 
17, Digestive Glands).

Pathology:  Gastric  microcirculation  and  gastric 
ulcers
Gastric microcirculation plays a signiﬁcant role in the 
protection of the integrity of the gastric mucosa. A 
breakdown in this protective mechanism, including
mucus and bicarbonate secretion, allows the  destruc-
tive action of hydrochloric acid and pepsin and bacte-
rial infection, leading to peptic ulcer disease (PUD). 
PUD includes a group of disorders characterized by 
a partial or total loss of the mucosal surface of the 
stomach or duodenum or both.

The rich blood supply to the gastric mucosa is of 
considerable signiﬁcance in understanding bleeding 
associated with stress ulcers. Stress ulcers are super-
ﬁcial gastric mucosal erosions observed after severe 
trauma or severe illness and after the long-term use 
of aspirin and corticosteroids. In most cases, stress 
ulcers are clinically asymptomatic and are detected 
only when they cause severe bleeding.

Neurotransmitters

The autonomic nervous system is represented in the alimentary 
tube by two distinct interconnected neuronal networks: the 
myenteric plexus of Auerbach (located between the circular 
and longitudinal  muscle layers and innervating the muscle 
fibers) and the submucosal plexus of Meissner (found 
between the muscularis and the mucosa and innervating the 
secretory glands). 
    The two plexuses are linked by axons and consist of sensory 
and motor neurons connected by interneurons. Although they 
can function independently of the central nervous system (CNS), 
they are regulated by preganglionic fibers of parasympathetic 
neurons of the vagus and pelvic nerves and postganglionic fibers 
of sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord and prevertebral 
ganglia. 

Some of the chemical neurotransmitters found in the enteric 
nerves are acetylcholine (excitatory); the two major inhibitory 
neurotransmitters nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal 
peptide (VIP); and tachykinins (such as substance P). 
Serotonin and somatostatin are products of interneurons.

Nerve supply of the digestive tube
The digestive tube is innervated by the autonomic 
nervous  system  (ANS). The  ANS  consists  of  an 
extrinsic  component  (the  parasympathetic  and 
sympathetic innervation) and an intrinsic, or enteric, 
component.

Sympathetic nerve ﬁbers derive from the thoracic 
and lumbar spinal cord.  Parasympathetic nerve ﬁbers 
derive from the vagal dorsal motor nucleus of the 
medulla oblongata. Visceral sensory ﬁbers originate 

in the spinal dorsal root ganglia.

The intrinsic or enteric innervation is represented 
by  two  distinct    interconnected  neuronal  circuits 
formed  by  sensory  and  motor  neurons  linked  by 
interneurons: 

1. The submucosal plexus of Meissner, present in 

the submucosa.

2. The myenteric plexus of Auerbach (Figure 15-
10), located  between the inner circular and outer 
longitudinal layers of the muscularis. 

Blood and nerve supply

15. UPPER DIGESTIVE SEGMENT

481

Neurons  and  interneurons  of  the  plexuses  give 
off  axons  that  branch  to  form  the  networks. The 
plexuses are connected to the  extrinsic sympathetic 
and parasympathetic ANS: the plexuses of Auerbach 
and  Meissner  receive  preganglionic  axons  of  the 
parasympathetic neurons and postganglionic axons 
of sympathetic neurons.

The  intrinsic  or  enteric  nervous  system  enables 
the digestive tube to respond to both local stimuli 
and  input  from  extrinsic  nerves  of  the  ANS.  The 
integrated extrinsic and intrinsic (enteric) networks 
regulate and control the following functions:

1. Peristaltic contractions of the muscularis and 

movements of the muscularis mucosae. 

2.  Secretory  activities  of  the  mucosal  and  sub-

mucosal glands.  

Stimulation  of  preganglionic  parasympathetic 
nerve ﬁbers (cholinergic terminals) of the muscu-
laris causes increased motility as well as glandular 
secretory  activity.    Stimulation  of  postganglionic 
sympathetic nerve ﬁbers (adrenergic terminals) on 
the smooth muscle cells causes decreased motility.   

and stomach, often causing vomiting (hematemesis). 
Mucosal and submucosal glands are found in the 
esophagus.  Their function is to produce continuously 
a thin layer of mucus that lubricates the surface of 
the epithelium. 

The mucosal tubular glands, residing in the lamina 
propria, resemble the cardiac glands of the stomach 
and are called cardiac esophageal glands. 

The submucosal tubuloacinar glands, found in the 
submucosa just beneath the muscularis mucosae, are 
organized into small lobules drained by a single duct 
(see Figure 15-11). The acini are lined by two secre-
tory cell types: a mucous  and a serous cell type, the 
latter with secretory granules containing  lysozyme.
The composition of the inner circumferential (or 
circular) and outer longitudinal layers of the mus-
cularis shows segment-dependent variations. In the 
upper third of the esophagus, both layers consist of 
striated muscle. In the middle third, smooth muscle 
ﬁbers can be seen deep to the striated muscle. In the 
lower  third,  both  layers  of  the  muscularis  contain 
smooth muscle cells.

Esophagus
The esophagus is a muscular tube linking the pharynx 
to the stomach. It runs through the thorax, crosses 
the diaphragm, and enters the stomach. Contractions 
of the muscularis propel the food down the esopha-
gus in about 2 seconds. At this velocity, changes of 
pressure and volume within the thorax are minimal. 
No disruption of respiration and cardiopulmonary 
circulation takes place. 

The  esophageal  mucosa  consists  of  a    stratiﬁed 
squamous  epithelium  overlying  a  lamina  propria 
with  numerous  connective  tissue  papillae  (Figure 
15-11). The muscularis mucosae is not present  in 
the upper portion of the esophagus, but it becomes 
organized near the stomach. 

The mucosa and the submucosa in the undistended 
esophagus form longitudinal folds that give the lu-
men an irregular outline. As the bolus of food moves 
down the esophagus, the folds disappear transiently 
and then are restored by the recoil of the elastic ﬁbers 
of the submucosa.

The  submucosa  contains  a  network  of  collagen 
and elastic ﬁbers and many small blood vessels. At 
the lower end of the esophagus, submucosal venous 
plexuses drain into both the systemic venous system 
and the portal venous system. An increase in pressure 
in the portal venous system, caused by chronic liver 
disease, results in dilation of the submucosal venous 
sinuses  and  the  formation  of  esophageal  varices. 
Rupture of the varices or ulceration of the overlying 
mucosa can produce hemorrhage into the esophagus 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Barrett’s metaplasia
The esophagus has two sphincters: 

1. The  anatomically  deﬁned  upper  esophageal 

sphincter (UES), or cricopharyngeal sphincter.

2. The  functionally  defined  lower  esophageal 

sphincter (LES), or gastroesophageal sphincter. 

The UES participates in the initiation of swal-
lowing. The LES prevents reﬂux of gastric contents 
into the esophagus. 

Because the esophageal stratiﬁed squamous lining 
epithelium  at  the  epithelial  transformation  zone 
may be replaced at the lower end by a poorly resis-
tant columnar epithelium (a process called Barrett’s 
esophagus or metaplasia). Gastroesophageal reﬂux 
disease,  (GERD)  causes  chronic  inﬂammation  or 
ulceration  and difﬁculty in swallowing (dysphagia). 
When the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm does 
not close entirely during development, a hiatus hernia 
enables a portion of the stomach to move into the 
thoracic cavity.  In sliding hiatus hernia, the stomach 
protrudes through the diaphragmatic hiatus, normally 
occupied by the lower esophagus. 

GERD and peptic ulceration in the intrathoracic 
portion of the stomach and lower esophagus  leads to 
difﬁculty in swallowing and the feeling of a lump in 
the throat. This condition, commonly seen in fam-
ily practice patients, affects young and middle-aged 
women in particular.

The movements involved in swallowing are co-
ordinated by nerves from the cervical and thoracic 
sympathetic  trunks,  forming  plexuses  in  the  sub-
mucosa and in between the inner and outer layers of 
the muscularis.

The stomach is usually divided into the cardia, 
fundus, body, and antrum. Based on the motility 
patterns of the stomach, it can be divided into an 
orad area, consisting of the fundus, and a portion 
of the body, and a caudad area, consisting of the 
distal body and the antrum.

Stomach
The  stomach  extends  from  the  esophagus  to  the 
duodenum. The epithelium changes from stratiﬁed 
squamous to a simple columnar type at the gastro-
esophageal junction.The muscularis mucosae of the 
esophagus is continuous with that of the stomach. 
However, the submucosa does not have a clear demar-
cation line, and glands from the cardiac portion of the 
stomach may extend under the stratiﬁed squamous 

epithelium and contact the esophageal cardiac glands.
The  function  of  the  stomach  is  to  homogenize 
and  chemically  process  the  swallowed  semisolid 
food. Both the contractions of the muscular wall of 
the stomach and the acid and enzymes secreted by the 
gastric mucosa contribute to this function. Once the 
food is transformed into a thick ﬂuid, it is released 
gradually into the duodenum.

Four regions are recognized in the stomach: 
1. The cardia, a 2- to 3-cm-wide zone surrounding 

the esophageal opening.

2. The fundus, projecting to the left of the opening 

of the esophagus.

Cardiac glands are simple tubular and coiled at the

    The coiled nature of cardiac glands results in cross

    Cardiac glands are lined by mucus-secreting cells 
and have a structure similar to the esophageal cardiac 
glands found in the mucosa of the esophagus.

The abrupt transition of the stratified squamous 
epithelium of the esophagus to the simple columnar 
mucus-secreting epithelium of the cardiac zone of the 
stomach is called epithelial transformation zone.

3. The body, an extensive central region.
4. The pyloric antrum (Greek pyloros, gatekeeper), 

ending at the gastroduodenal oriﬁce. 

Based on the motility characteristics of the stom-
ach, the orad area, consisting of the fundus and the 
upper part of the body, relaxes during swallowing. 
The caudad area, consisting of the lower portion of 
the body and the antrum, participates in the regula-
tion of gastric emptying.

The empty stomach shows gastric mucosal folds, 
or rugae, covered by gastric  pits or foveolae (Figure 
15-12).  A  gastric  mucosal  barrier,  produced  by 
surface mucous cells, protects the mucosal surface. 
The  surface  mucous  cells  contain  apical  periodic 
acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive granules and are linked 
to each other by apical tight junctions. 

Cardia region 
Glands of the cardia region are tubular, with a coiled 
end and an opening continuous with the gastric pits 
(Figure 15-13). A mucus-secreting epithelium lines 
the cardiac glands. 

The gastric gland 
Gastric  glands  of  the  fundus-body  region  are  the 

Muscularis mucosae

major contributors to the gastric juice. About 15 mil-
lion gastric glands open into 3.5 million gastric pits. 
From two to seven gastric glands open into a single 
gastric pit, or foveola. 

A gastric gland consists of three regions: 
1. The pit, or foveola, lined by surface mucous cells.
2. The neck, containing mucous neck cells, mitoti-

cally active stem cells, and parietal cells.

3. The body, representing the major length of the 
gland. The  upper  and  lower  portions  of  the  body 
contain  different  proportions  of  cells  lining  the 
gastric gland. 

 The  gastric  glands  proper  house  ﬁve  major  cell 

types (Figure 15-14; see also Figure 15-13): 

1. Mucous cells, including the surface mucous cells 

and the mucous neck cells.

2. Chief cells, also called peptic cells.
3. Parietal cells, also called oxyntic cells.
4. Stem cells.
5. Gastroenteroendocrine cells, called enterochro-
mafﬁn cells because of their staining afﬁnity for chro-
mic acid salts. We discuss them later in this chapter.  
 The upper portion of the main body of the gastric 
gland contains abundant parietal cells. Chief cells and 
gastroenteroendocrine cells predominate in the lower 
portion (see Figure 15-14).

A simple columnar epithelium,

in multiple small droplets (goblet 
cells display a flattened nucleus 
in the basal portion of the cell).

Mucous cells. The gastric mucosa of the fundus-
body region has two classes of mucus-producing cells 
(see Figure 15-15):

1. The surface mucous cells, lining the pits.
2. The mucous neck cells, located at the opening 

of the gastric gland into the pit. 

Both  cells  produce  mucins,  glycoproteins  with 
high  molecular  mass.  A  mucus  layer,  containing 
95% water and 5% mucins, forms an insoluble gel 
that  attaches  to  the  surface  of  the  gastric  mucosa, 

forming a 100-μm-thick protective mucosal barrier.  
This protective mucus blanket traps bicarbonate ions 
and  neutralizes  the  microenvironment  adjacent  to 
the apical region of the surface mucous cells to an 
alkaline pH. 

Na+, K+, and Cl– are constituents of the protec-
tive mucosal barrier. Patients with chronic vomiting 
or undergoing continuous aspiration of gastric juice 
require intravenous replacement of NaCl, dextrose, 
and K+ to prevent hypokalemic metabolic acidosis.

Vagal nerve stimulation and acetylcholine increase the secretion of soluble 
mucus by neck cells, located where the gland opens into the pit. 
    Similar to mucins produced by surface mucous cells, the soluble mucus mixes 
with the gastric chyme to lubricate the glandular and mucosal surfaces.

Ménétrier’s disease is a condition associated with  
transforming growth factor-(cid:95) (TGF-(cid:95))–induced hy-
perplasia of surface mucous cells in the gastric mucosa. 
Clinical manifestations of the disease include nausea, 
vomiting,  epigastric  pain,  gastrointestinal  bleeding, 
diarrhea, and  hypoalbuminemia. The diagnosis of Mé-
nétrier’s disease is established by endoscopy (presence 
of large gastric folds) and biopsy, showing signiﬁcant  
gastric  pit  hyperplasia  with  glandular  atrophy  and 

reduction in the numbers of parietal cells. Treatment 
includes  medications  to  relieve  nausea  and  gastric 
pain, as well as cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that 
blocks TGF-(cid:95) receptor signaling.

Chief cells (Figure 15-16) predominate in the lower 
third of the gastric gland. Chief cells are not present 
in cardiac glands and are seldom found in the pyloric 
antrum. Chief cells have a structural similarity to the 
zymogenic cells of the exocrine pancreas: the basal

The gastric glands of the fundus-body region contain two major cell types: 
    1. Chief or peptic cells, which produce and secrete pepsinogen (42.5 kd), a 
precursor of the proteolytic enzyme pepsin (35 kd) produced in the gastric juice 
when the pH is below 5.0. Pepsin can catalyze the formation of additional 
pepsin from pepsinogen. Acetylcholine stimulates the secretion of pepsinogen.
    2. Parietal or oxyntic cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic 
factor in humans (in some species, chief cells secrete intrinsic factor).  The 
cytoplasm of parietal cells displays numerous tubulovesicles and an 
secretory canaliculus continuous with the lumen of the gastric gland. 
    After stimulation, the tubulovesicles fuse with the plasma membrane of the 
secretory canaliculus. Carbonic anhydrase and H+,K+-ATPase are localized in 
the microvilli projecting into the lumen of the secretory canaliculus.

region of the cytoplasm contains an extensive rough 
endoplasmic reticulum. Pepsinogen-containing secre-
tory granules (zymogen granules) are observed in the 
apical region of the cell.  

Pepsinogen, a proenzyme stored in the zymogen 
granules, is released into the lumen of the gland and 
converted in the acid environment of the stomach 
to pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme capable of digesting 
most proteins. Exocytosis of pepsinogen is rapid and  
stimulated by feeding (after fasting).

Parietal  cells predominate near the neck and in 
the upper segment of the gastric gland and are linked 
to chief cells by junctional complexes. 

Parietal cells produce the hydrochloric acid of the 
gastric juice and  intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein that 
binds to vitamin B12. 

Vitamin  B12 binds  in  the  stomach  to  the  trans-
porting binding protein intrinsic factor. In the small 
intestine, the vitamin B12–intrinsic factor complex 
binds to intrinsic factor receptor on the surface of  
enterocytes in the ileum and is transported to the 
liver through the portal circulation.  

Autoimmune gastritis is caused by autoantibod-
ies  to  H+,K+-dependent  ATPase,  a  parietal  cell 
antigen, and intrinsic factor. Destruction of parietal 
cells causes a reduction in hydrochloric acid in the 
gastric juice (achlorhydria) and a lack of synthesis 
of intrinsic factor. 

The resulting vitamin B12 deﬁciency disrupts the 
formation  of  red  blood  cells  in  the  bone  marrow, 

leading to a condition known as pernicious anemia, 
identiﬁed  by  examination  of  peripheral  blood  as 
megaloblastic anemia characterized by macrocytic red 
blood cells and hypersegmented large neutrophils (see 
Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis).

Parietal  cells  have  three  distinctive  features  (see 

Figure 15-16): 

1. Abundant mitochondria, which occupy about 
40% of the cell volume and provide the adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) required to pump H+ ions into 
the lumen of the secretory canaliculus.

2. A secretory or intracellular canaliculus, formed 
by an invagination of the apical cell surface and con-
tinuous with the lumen of the gastric gland, which 
is lined by numerous microvilli.

3. An H+,K+-dependent ATPase-rich tubulovesicu-
lar system, which is distributed along the secretory 
canaliculus during the resting state of the parietal cell.
After stimulation, the tubulovesicular system fuses 
with the membrane of the secretory canaliculus, and 
numerous  microvilli  project  into  the  canalicular 
space.  Membrane  fusion  increases  the  amount  of  
H+,K+-ATPase and expands the secretory canaliculus. 
H+,K+-ATPase represents about 80% of the protein 
content of the plasma membrane of the microvilli.

Secretion of hydrochloric acid  
Parietal cells produce an acidic secretion (pH 0.9 to 
2.0) rich in hydrochloric acid, with a concentration of 
H+ ions one million times greater than that of blood 
(Figure 15-17). The release of H+ ions and Cl– by 
the parietal cell involves the membrane fusion of the 
tubulovesicular system with the secretory canaliculus.
The parasympathetic (vagus nerve) mediator ace-
tylcholine  (bound  to  a  muscarinic  (M3)  receptor) 
and the peptide gastrin, produced by enteroendocrine 
cells of the pyloric antrum, stimulate parietal cells to 
secrete HCl (see Figure 15-20). 

Acetylcholine also stimulates the release of gastrin. 
Histamine potentiates the effects of acetylcholine and 
gastrin on parietal cell secretion after binding to the 
histamine  H2  receptor.  Histamine  is  produced  by 
enterochromafﬁn-like (ECL) cells within the lamina 
propria surrounding the gastric glands. Cimetidine 
is an H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits histamine-
dependent acid secretion.  

H+,K+-dependent ATPase facilitates the exchange 
of H+ and K+. Cl– and Na+ (derived from the dissocia-
tion of NaCl) are actively transported into the lumen 
of the secretory canaliculus, leading to the production 
of HCl.  K+ and Na+ are recycled back into the cell  
by separate pumps once H+ has taken their place. 
Omeprazole,  with  binding  affinity  to  H+,K+-
dependent ATPase, inactivates acid secretion and is 
an effective agent in the treatment of peptic ulcer.

into H+ and hydroxyl ions (HO–). Carbon dioxide, 
entering the cell from the blood or formed during 
metabolism of the cell, combines with HO– to form 
carbonic acid under the inﬂuence of carbonic anhy-
drase. Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate ions 
(HCO3–) and hydrogen ions. HCO3– diffuses out of 
the cell into the blood and accounts for the increase 
in blood plasma pH during digestion. 

Pathology: Helicobacter pylori infection
The gastric juice is a combination of two separate 
secretions: 

1. An alkaline mucosal gel protective secretion, pro-
duced by surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells.
2. HCl and pepsin, two parietal cell–chief cell–de-
rived potentially aggressive secretions. The protective 
secretion is constitutive; it is always present. The ag-
gressive secretion is facultative because hydrochloric 
acid and pepsin levels increase above basal levels after 
food intake.

The  viscous,  highly  glycosylated  gastric  mucus 
blanket,  produced  by  surface  mucous  cells  and 
mucous  neck  cells,  maintains  a  neutral  pH  at  the 
epithelial cell surfaces of the stomach. In addition, 
the  mitochondrial-rich  surface  mucous  cells  (see 
Figure 15-15) produce HCO3– ions diffusing into 
the surface mucus gel. Recall the clinical signiﬁcance 

490

 15. UPPER DIGESTIVE SEGMENT

Parietal cell 

during chronic vomiting of Na+, K+, and Cl– present 
in the protective mucosal barrier and gastric juice (see 
section on functions of the gastric gland).

HCO3– ions, produced by  parietal cells, enter the 
fenestrated capillaries of the lamina propria. Some of 
the HCO3– ions diffuse into the mucus blanket and 
neutralize the low pH created by the HCl content of 
the gastric lumen at the vicinity of the surface mucous 
cells (Figure 15-18).

However,  the  mucus  blanket  lining  the  gastric 
epithelium, in particular in the pyloric antrum, is the 
site where the ﬂagellated bacterium Helicobacter pylori 
resides in spite of the hostile environment. 

H. pylori survives and replicates in the gastric lu-
men. Its presence has been associated with acid peptic 
ulcers and adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

Three phases deﬁne the pathogenesis of H. pylori 

(Figure 15-19): 

1. An active phase, in which motile bacteria in-
crease the gastric pH  by producing ammonia through 
the action of urease. 

2. A stationary phase, consisting in the bacterial 
attachment  to  fucose-containing  receptors  on  the 
surface of mucous surface cells of the pyloric region. 
H. pylori attachment results in the production of cy-
totoxic proteases that ensure the bacteria a supply of 
nutrients from surface mucous cells and also attract 
leukocytes. Both ammonia production and cytotoxic 
proteases correlate with the development of peptic 
ulcers of the pyloric mucosa.

3. During the colonization phase, H. pylori detach 
from the fucose-containing receptors of the surface 
mucus epithelium, increase in number by replication 
within the mucus blanket, and remain attached to 
glycoproteins containing sialic acid. Despite the rapid 
turnover of the gastric mucus-secreting cells, H.  pylori 
avoids being ﬂushed away with dead epithelial cells 
by producing urease and displaying high motility. 

About 20% of the population is infected with H. 
pylori by age 20 years. The incidence of the infection 
increases to about 60% by age 60. Most infected indi-
viduals do not have clinical symptoms.  Intense, sud-
den, persistent stomach pain (relieved by eating and 
antacid medications), hematemesis (blood vomit), or 
melena (tarlike black stool) are clinical symptoms in 
some patients. Increasing evidence for the infectious 
origin of acid peptic disease and chronic gastritis led 
to the implementation of antibiotic therapy for all 
ulcer patients shown to be infected with H. pylori.

Blood tests to detect antibodies to H. pylori and 
urea  breath  tests  are  effective  diagnostic  methods. 
Treatment usually consists in a combination of anti-
biotics, suppressors of H+,K+-dependent ATPase, and 
stomach protectors. 

More recently, attention has been directed to ad-
hesins and fucose-containing receptors as potential

Active phase

During the active phase, H. pylori  in the 
pyloric antrum are highly motile for a short 
period of time. About six flagella provide the 
motility. During this time, H. pylori decrease 
the acidity by producing ammonia (NH3) by 
the action of the enzyme urease.

2

Stationary  phase

H. pylori  enter the mucus blanket, produce 
adhesins, adhesion molecules with binding 
affinity to fucose-containing receptors, and 
attach to the apical surfaces of the mucous 
epithelial cells containing fucose-binding sites. 
Cell attachment enables adherent H.  pylori to 
obtain nutrients from epithelial cells, which 
later die.

3

Colonization  phase

Well-nourished H. pylori  detach from the 
apical surface of the mucus-secreting 
surface cells, replicate within the mucus 
blanket, and attach to sialic acid– 
containing mucous proteins. Bacteria 
reenter the active phase (motility and NH3 
production) and reinitiate their life cycle.

Regeneration of epithelial cells of 

the gastric mucosa

Stem cells are mitotic-dividing cells present 
adjacent to the neck region of the gastric gland 
and are responsible for the continuous renewal 
of the gastric mucosa. Daughter cells derived 
from the stem cell migrate either upward to 
replace surface mucous cells, or downward to 
differentiate into parietal cells, chief cells, and 
gastroenteroendocrine cells.
    Surface mucous cells have a life span of 
about 3 days; parietal and chief cells have a life 
span of more than 190 days.

Synthesis and release of peptide hormones by 

gastroenteroendocrine cells

To target cell

       Lipid-soluble amino acids enter a gastroenteroendocrine 
1
cell and are decarboxylated to form amines. Amines are part of 
polypeptide hormones that can stimulate or inhibit target cell 
function.

       A polypeptide hormone is released from the 
2
gastroenteroendocrine cell into the surrounding lamina propria 
and reaches the blood capillaries.
 
        Blood-borne peptides bind to target cells to stimulate  or 
inhibit a cellular function.

       Vagal stimulation of the pyloric antrum causes the release of 
4
gastrin-releasing peptide from postsynaptic neurons that 
stimulate directly the release of gastrin from G cells present in the 
antrum. Somatostatin released from adjacent D cells (not shown) 
inhibits gastrin release.

       Histamine, released by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in 
5
the lamina propria in response to acetylcholine released by 
postganglionic fibers, binds to the H2 receptor on parietal cells. 
     Histamine potentiates the effect of acetylcholine and gastrin 
on the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells.

targets for drug action. The objective is to prevent 
binding of pathogenic bacteria without interfering 
with  the  endogenous  bacterial  ﬂora  by  the  use  of 
antibiotics.

Gastroenteroendocrine cells
The function of the alimentary tube is regulated by 
peptide hormones, produced by gastroenteroendo-
crine cells, and neuroendocrine mediators, produced 
by neurons.

Peptide  hormones  are  synthesized  by  gastroen-
teroendocrine cells dispersed throughout the mucosa 

from the stomach through the colon. The population 
of  gastroenteroendocrine  cells  is  so  large  that  the 
gastrointestinal  segment  is  regarded  as  the  largest 
endocrine organ in the body. 

Gastroenteroendocrine  cells  are  members  of  the 
APUD system, so called because of the amine precur-
sor uptake and decarboxylation property of amino 
acids (Figure 15-20). 

Because not all the cells accumulate amine precur-
sors,  the  designation  APUD  has  been  replaced  by 
DNES (for diffuse neuroendocrine system). 

Neuroendocrine mediators are released from nerve

terminals. Acetylcholine is released at the terminals of 
postganglionic cholinergic nerves. Gastrin-releasing 
peptide is released by postsynaptic neurons activated 
by stimulation of the vagus nerve (see Figure 15-20).
Peptide  hormones  produced  by  gastrointestinal 
endocrine cells have the following general functions:
1. Regulation of water, electrolyte metabolism, and 

enzyme secretion.

2.  Regulation  of  gastrointestinal  motility  and 

mucosal growth.

3.  Stimulation  of  the  release  of  other  peptide 

hormones. 

We  consider  six  major  gastrointestinal  peptide 
hormones: secretin, gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, motilin, 
and ghrelin.

Secretin was the ﬁrst peptide hormone to be dis-
covered (in 1902). Secretin is released by cells in the 
duodenal  glands  of  Lieberkühn  when  the  gastric 
contents  enter  the  duodenum.  Secretin  stimulates 
pancreatic and duodenal (Brunner’s glands) bicar-
bonate and ﬂuid release to control the gastric acid 
secretion (antacid effect) and regulate the pH of the 
duodenal  contents.  Secretin,  together  with  CCK, 
stimulates the growth of the exocrine pancreas. In 
addition,  secretin  (and  acetylcholine)  stimulates 
chief cells to secrete pepsinogen, and inhibits gastrin 
release to reduce HCl secretion in the stomach.

Gastrin  is  produced  by  G  cells  located  in  the 
pyloric  antrum. Three  forms  of  gastrin  have  been 
described: little gastrin, or G17 (which contains 17 
amino acids), big gastrin, or G34 (which contains 34 
amino acids), and minigastrin, or G14 (which consists 
of 14 amino acids). G cells produce primarily G17. 
The duodenal mucosa in humans contains G cells 
producing mainly G34. The neuroendocrine media-
tor gastrin-releasing peptide regulates the release of 
gastrin. Somatostatin, produced by adjacent D cells, 
inhibits the release of gastrin (see Figure 15-20).

The main function of gastrin is to stimulate the 
production of HCl by parietal cells. Low gastric pH 
inhibits further gastrin secretion. 

Gastrin can also activate CCK to stimulate gall-
bladder contraction. Gastrin has a trophic effect on 
the mucosa of the small and large intestine and the 
fundic region of the stomach.

Gastrin stimulates the growth of ECL cells of the 
stomach. Continued hypersecretion of gastrin results 
in hyperplasia of ECL cells. ECL cells produce his-
tamine by decarboxylation of histidine. Histamine 
binds to the histamine H2 receptor on parietal cells  
to potentiate the effect of gastrin and acetylcholine 
on  HCl  secretion  (see  Figure  15-19).    Histamine 
H2  receptor  blocking  drugs  (such  as  cimetidine 
[Tagamet]  and  ranitidine  [Zantac])  are  effective 
inhibitors of acid secretion.

CCK is produced in the duodenum. CCK stimu-
lates gallbladder contraction and relaxation of the 
sphincter of Oddi when protein- and fat-rich chyme 
enters the duodenum. 

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), 
formerly called gastric-   inhibitory peptide, is pro-
duced in the duodenum. GIP stimulates insulin re-
lease (insulinotropic effect) when glucose is detected 
in the small intestine.  

Motilin  is  released  cyclically  (every  90  minutes) 
during  fasting  from  the  upper  small  intestine  and 
stimulates gastrointestinal motility. A neural control 
mechanism regulates the release of motilin.

Ghrelin  is  produced  in  the  stomach  (fundus). 
Ghrelin, binds to its receptor  present in growth hor-
mone–secreting cells of the anterior hypophysis, and 
stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. Ghrelin 
plasma levels increase during fasting triggering hunger 
by acting on hypothalamic feeding centers. 

Plasma levels of ghrelin are high in patients with 
Prader-Willi  syndrome  (caused  by  abnormal  gene 
imprinting;  see  section  on  epigenetics  in  Chapter 
20, Spermatogenesis). Severe hypotonia and feeding 
difﬁculties in early infancy, followed by obesity and 
uncontrollable appetite, hypogonadism, and infertil-
ity are characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
Patients with gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas, 
or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) display parietal cell 
hyperplasia, mucosal hypertrophy of the fundic region 
of the stomach, and high acid secretion independent 
of feeding. The secretion of gastrin is not regulated 
by the low gastric pH feedback mechanism.

Gastrinoma  is  a  rare  tumor  of  the  pancreas  and 
duodenum  that  causes  ectopic  hypersecretion  of 
gastrin  resulting  in  the  hypersecretion  of  HCl  by 
parietal cells, leading to severe peptic ulcer disease. 
Gastrinoma is more common in men than in women, 
and the age at onset is generally between 40 and 55 
years of age.

The complications of gastrinomas are fulminant 
stomach ulceration, diarrhea (due to an inhibitory 
effect of water and sodium reabsorption by the small 
intestine due to excessive gastrin), steatorrhea (caused 
by inactivation of pancreatic lipase determined by the 
low pH), and hypokalemia.

Pyloric glands
Pyloric  glands  differ  from  the  cardiac  and  gastric 
glands in the following layers: 

1. The gastric pits, or foveolae, are deeper and 

extend halfway through the depth of the mucosa.

2.  Pyloric  glands  have  a  larger  lumen  and  are 

highly branched (Figure 15-20).

Muscularis mucosae

Pyloric glands are simple tubular and branched at the very lower end.  
    The pits are deeper than in the cardiac glands and gastric glands of the 
fundus-body region.
    Pyloric glands are lined by mucus-secreting cells. 
    At the distal end, the contents of the mucus-secreting cells displace and 
flatten the nuclei to the basal domain of the cell.  

gland  is  a  mucus-secreting  cell  that  resembles  the 
mucous  neck  cells  of  the  gastric  glands.    Most  of 
the cell contains large and pale secretory mucus and 
secretory granules containing lysozyme, a bacterial 
lytic enzyme. Occasionally,  parietal cells can be found 
in the pyloric glands. 

Enteroendocrine cells, gastrin-secreting G cells in 
particular, are abundant in the antrum pyloric region. 
Lymphoid nodules can be seen in the lamina propria.

Mucosa,  submucosa,  muscularis,  and  serosa  of 
the stomach
We complete this discussion by pointing out addi-
tional structural and functional details of the mucosa, 
submucosa, muscularis, and serosa of the stomach.

The  mucosa  consists  of  loose  connective  tissue, 
called  the  lamina  propria,  surrounding  cardiac, 
gastric, and pyloric glands. 

Reticular and collagen ﬁbers predominate in the 
lamina propria, and elastic ﬁbers are rare. The cell 
components of the lamina propria include ﬁbroblasts, 
lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, and a few plasma 
cells. The muscularis mucosae can project thin strands 
of muscle cells into the mucosa to facilitate the release 
of secretions from the gastric glands.

The  submucosa  consists  of  dense  irregular  con-
nective tissue in which collagenous and elastic ﬁbers 
are abundant. A large number of arterioles, venous 
plexuses, and lymphatics are present in the submu-
cosa. Also present are the cell bodies and nerve ﬁbers 
of the submucosal plexus of Meissner.

The  muscularis  (or  muscularis  externa)  of  the 
stomach  consists  of  three  poorly  deﬁned  layers  of 
smooth  muscle  oriented  in  circular,  oblique,  and 
longitudinal  directions.  At  the  level  of  the  distal 
pyloric antrum, the circular muscle layer thickens to 
form the annular pyloric sphincter.

Contraction of the muscularis is under control of 
the  autonomic  nerve  plexuses  located  between  the 
muscle layers (myenteric plexus of Auerbach). 

Based on motility functions, the stomach can be 

divided into two major regions: 

1. The orad (Latin os [plural ora], mouth; ad, to; 
toward the mouth) portion, consisting of the fundus 
and part of the body.

2. The caudad (Latin cauda, tail; ad, to; toward 
the tail) portion, comprising the distal body and the 
antrum (see Figure 15-11). 

During swallowing, the orad region of the stom-
ach and the LES relax to accommodate the ingested 
material. The tonus of the muscularis adjusts to the 
volume of the organ without increasing the pressure 
in the lumen. 

Contraction of the caudad portion of the stomach 
mixes and propels the gastric contents toward the 
gastroduodenal  junction.  Most  solid  contents  are 
propelled back (retropulsion) into the main body 
of the stomach because of the closure of  the distal 
antrum. Liquids empty more rapidly.  Retropulsion 
determines both mixing  and mechanical dissocia-
tion of solid particles. When the gastric juice empties 
into the duodenum, peristaltic waves from the orad 
to  the  caudad  portion  of  the  stomach  propel  the 
contents in coordination with the relaxation of the 
pyloric sphincter.

 The serosa consists of loose connective tissue and 

blood vessels of the subserosal plexus.

Essential concepts

Upper Digestive Segment

• Mouth or oral cavity. The mouth is the 
entry site to the digestive tube. Its functions 
are ingestion, partial digestion, and lubrication 
of the food, or bolus. The mouth includes the 
lips, cheeks, teeth, gums (or gingivae), tongue, 
uvula, and hard and soft palate.

  The oral cavity are lined by three types of 
mucosae with structural variations:
  (1) Lining mucosa (lips, cheeks, ventral 
surface of the tongue, soft palate, ﬂoor of the 
mouth and alveolar mucosa).
  (2) Masticatory mucosa (gingiva and hard 
palate).
  (3) Specialized mucosa (dorsal surface of 
the tongue).

  There are three transition sites of the oral 
mucosa:
  (1) The mucocutaneous junction (between 
the skin and the mucosa of the lips).
  (2) The mucogingival junction (between the 
gingiva and alveolar mucosa).
  (3) The dentogingival junction (between 
the mucosa of the gingiva and the enamel of 
the tooth), a sealing site that prevents from 
periodontal diseases. 

  Lips consist of three regions:  
  (1) The cutaneous region  (thin skin; keratin-
ized stratiﬁed squamous epithelium with hair 
follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands). 
  (2) The red or vermilion region (lined by 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium supported by a 
highly vascularized connective tissue and skel-
etal muscles). Salivary glands are not present 
in the mucosa of the vermilion region.
  (3) The oral mucosal region, continuous with 
the mucosa of the cheeks and gums.
   The epithelial lining of the gums is similar to 
the red region of the lips. The lamina propria 
binds to the periosteum of the alveolar pro-
cesses of the maxilla and mandible. Submu-
cosa or glands are not seen.
   The hard palate is lined by a keratinizing 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium. Collagenous 
ﬁbers in the submucosa bind the mucosa to 
the periosteum of the hard palate.
   The soft palate and uvula are lined by 
nonkeratinizing stratiﬁed squamous epithelium 
extending into the oropharynx.

• Tongue. The dorsal surface of the tongue is 
covered by nonkeratinizing stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium supported by a lamina propria 
associated to a skeletal muscle core. The 

posterior one third displays aggregations of 
lymphatic tissue, the lingual tonsils.
  The dorsal surface of the tongue contains 
lingual papillae. 
  They are of four types of lingual papillae: 
  (1) Filiform papillae, the most abundant; the 
only type of papilla without taste buds. 
  (2) Fungiform papillae. 
  (3) Circumvallate papillae (with taste buds; 
associated with serous glands, or Ebner’s 
glands). 
  (4) Foliate papillae (poorly developed in 
humans). 
  Serous and mucous glands extend across 
the lamina propria and the muscle. Their 
ducts open into the crypts and furrows of 
the lingual tonsils and circumvallate papillae, 
respectively.
  Taste buds consist of taste receptor cells, 
supporting cells (immature taste cells), and 
precursor taste cells (basal cells). 
  Tastants (sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and 
umami) enter through the taste pore and 
bind to taste receptors (type 1 receptors, 
designated T1Rs) present in apical microvilli 
of taste receptor cells. 
  T1Rs are linked to the G-protein(cid:3)(cid:95),(cid:3)(cid:96), and (cid:97) 
subunit complex (called gustducin). Binding

of the (cid:95)(cid:3)subunit of the G-protein complex to 
phospholipase C (PLC) triggers the production 
of second messengers (inositol triphosphate, 
IP3, and diacylglycerol, DAG) that activate ion 
channels in the taste receptor cells. An inﬂux 
of Na+ within taste cells causes depolariza-
tion of the taste receptor cells. An increase in 
intracellular Ca2+, released from intracellular 
storage sites, triggers the release of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular space 
and  of neurotransmitters at the synapses with 
gustatory afferent nerve terminals.

• Tooth. It consists of a crown, neck, and a 
single or multiple roots. 
  Enamel and dentin are parts of the crown.  
The outer surface of the root is covered by 
cementum. Cementum is associated with the 
periodontal ligament, ﬁrmly attached to the 
alveolar bone.
  A central chamber, the pulp, opens at the 
apical foramen, the site where blood vessels, 
nerves, and lymphatics enter and leave the 
pulp chamber.

  Tooth development. The ectoderm (amelo-
blasts), cranial neural crest (odontoblasts), and 
mesenchyme (cementocytes) contribute to 
tooth development.
  The stages of tooth development are:
  (1) Bud stage: Ectodermic epithelial cells to 
proliferate and form the epithelial tooth bud.
  (2) Early cap stage: Cells of the epithelial 
tooth bud proliferate and invaginate into the 
underlying mesoderm.
  (3) Late cap stage: The cells at the growing 
end of the dental bud form a caplike structure. 
The epithelial tooth bud is lined by an outer 
and inner dental epithelium. The bud of the 
permanent tooth develops from the dental 
lamina and remains dormant. The enamel 
knot signals tooth development.
  (4) Bell stage: At the enamel knot site, the 
outermost cells of the dental papilla differenti-
ate into dentin-producing odontoblasts. A 
single layer of enamel-secreting ameloblasts 
develops in the inner dental epithelium por-
tion of the enamel knot.
  (5) Tooth eruption: The dental sac gives rise 
to cementoblasts, which secrete a layer of 
cementum, and cells forming the periodontal 
ligament, holding the tooth in its bony socket, 
or alveolus.

  Odontoblasts are present at the periphery 
of the pulp. Odontoblasts produce predentin 
(nonmineralized material surrounding the api-
cal processes of the odontoblast) and dentin 
(consisting of 20% organic material, primarily 
type I collagen; 70% inorganic material; and 
10% water). 
  Mineralized dentin (crystals of hydroxyapatite 
and ﬂuoroapatite) forms the dentinal tubes 
containing the odontoblast apical processes.

  Ameloblasts, present in the developing 
tooth only, face the dentin material and 
secrete enamel. The apical region of the am-
eloblast, Tomes’ process, becomes surrounded 

by enamel, the hardest substance found in 
the body (95% crystals of hydroxyapatite 
and a decreasing content of protein during 
mineralization). 
  Enamel consists of enamel rods separated 
by an interrod region. The extracellular matrix 
of the developing enamel (amelogenesis) 
contains two classes of proteins: amelogenin 
(90%) and nonamelogenins (10%), including 
enamelin and ameloblastin.
  Amelogenesis imperfecta is an X chromo-
some–linked inherited disease affecting the 
synthesis of amelogenin required for the for-
mation of the tooth enamel; affected enamel 
does not attain its normal thickness, hardness, 
and color. Autosomal-dominant amelogenesis 
imperfecta is caused by a mutation of the 
enamelin gene. 

• Non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions of 
the oral mucosa include:
  (1) Reactive ﬁbroepithelial hyperplasia follow-
ing traumatic injury or irritation of the gingiva 
and palate caused by dentures.
  (2) Viral infections: Herpes simplex viral 
infection can cause ulceration of the gingiva 
and palate. Verrucous papillary lesions of the 
oral mucosa are seen in human papillomavirus 
infection. 
  (3) Hairy (papillate) leukoplakia in the lateral 
margins of the tongue occurs in HIV-positive 
patients and in individual with immuno-sup-
pressed conditions as opportunistic Epstein-
Barr viral infection.
  (4) Squamous cell carcinoma represents the 
predominant oral malignant condition seen in 
adults with predominant localizations in the 
lateral tongue and the ﬂoor of the mouth.
  (5) Oral melanomas are generally localized 
in palate and gingiva and can be in situ or 
multiple invasive lesions with irregular borders 
and ulcerated. 
  (6) Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are observed 
in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 
(Waldeyer’s ring) in patients with HIV-infection.  
  (7) Kaposi’s sarcoma is seen in palate and 
gingiva in the form of macular or nodular le-
sions, in association with cutaneous localiza-
tion. The lesion consists in the  proliferation of 
endothelial cells of blood vessels. 
  (8) Neural tumors include schwannoma, an 
encapsulated tumor containing Schwann cells. 

•   General organization of the digestive tube 
(esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and 
large intestine). 
  Digestive organs have four concentric layers: 
  (1) Mucosa (epithelium, lamina propria, and 
muscularis mucosae). 
  (2) Submucosa. 
  (3) Muscularis (inner circular layer; outer 
longitudinal layer). 
  (4) Adventitia, or serosa. 

  Remember the following distinctions: 
  (1) The mucosa of the esophagus has folds. 
  (2) The mucosa of the stomach has gastric 
glands with opening pits or foveola. 
  (3) The mucosa of the small intestine 

(duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) displays 
evaginations (villi) of segment-speciﬁc shape 
and length, and invaginations called the crypts 
or glands of Lieberkühn. 
  (4) The mucosa of the large intestine has 
tubular glands with openings. 

  The digestive tube is innervated by the 
autonomic nervous system, consisting of an 
extrinsic component (parasympathetic and 
sympathetic innervation) and intrinsic com-
ponents: the submucosal plexus of Meissner 
and the myenteric plexus of Auerbach.

• Esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular 
tube lined by a mucosa consisting of stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. 
  The mucosa and submucosa form longitu-
dinal folds. Mucosal and submucosal glands 
lubricate the surface of the esophageal 
epithelium. 
  The muscularis has segment-dependent 
variations: the upper region consists of 
skeletal muscle; the middle region has a com-
bination of skeletal and smooth muscle; and 
the lower region has predominantly smooth 
muscle. Contractions of the muscularis propel 
the food down the esophagus in about 2 
seconds.
  An anatomically upper esophageal sphincter 
([UES]; cricopharyngeal muscle) is involved in 
the initiation of swallowing; a functional lower 
esophageal sphincter (LES) prevents reﬂux of 
gastric juice into the esophagus. 
  At the gastroesophageal junction (transfor-
mation zone), the esophageal epithelium 
changes from stratiﬁed squamous to a simple 
columnar type. 
  Gastric juice reﬂux can produce an inﬂam-
matory reaction (reﬂux esophagitis) or ulcer-
ation and difﬁculty in swallowing (dysphagia). 
Persistent reﬂux replaces, at the gastroesopha-
geal junction, the esophageal stratiﬁed colum-
nar epithelium by a less resistant columnar 
epithelium. 
  Hiatus hernia, caused by a failure of the 
diaphragm to close during development, en-
ables a portion of the stomach to move into 
the thoracic cavity. A portion of the stomach 
can slide through the diaphragmatic hiatus 
causing a sliding hiatus hernia. 

• Stomach. The function of the stomach is to 
homogenize and chemically process the swal-
lowed semisolid food. 
  The stomach is divided into:
  (1) The cardia.
  (2) The fundus.
  (3) The body.
  (4) The pyloric antrum. 
  The glands of the cardia region are tubular 
with a coiled end. In the fundus and body, the 
gastric glands are simple tubular branched. 
In the pyloric antrum, glands have a deep pit 
and are simple tubular branched. 
  Characteristic features of the stomach are:
  (1) The ruga, a fold of the gastric mucosa 
and submucosa.
  (2) A gastric mucosal blanket.

  The gastric gland (present in the fundus and 
body) has a pit, a neck, and a body. 
  
  The cell types found in the gastric glands are:
  (1) Surface mucous cells are found in the pit 
or foveola. Surface mucous cells have apical 
secretory granules containing glycoproteins 
(mucins) that, when combined with water 
on the surface of the gastric mucosa form a 
protective gel. 
Mitochondria are abundant. Together with 
carbonic anhydrase, surface mucous cells 
produce bicarbonate ions to increase the pH 
of the protective gel.
  Ménétrier’s disease is associated with  
transforming growth factor-(cid:95) (TGF-(cid:95))–induced 
hyperplasia of surface mucous cells in the 
gastric mucosa. The diagnosis of Ménétrier’s 
disease is established by endoscopy (pres-
ence of large gastric folds) and biopsy, show-
ing signiﬁcant  gastric pit hyperplasia in the 
folds, glandular atrophy, and reduction in the 
numbers of parietal cells. 
  (2) Mucous neck cells, located at the junc-
tion of the pit with the body, secrete mucus 
that is part of the protective gastric mucosal 
blanket.
  (3) Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, a precur-
sor of the proteolytic enzyme pepsin produced 
in the gastric juice when the pH is below 5.0. 
  (4) Parietal cells are seen in the upper region 
of the body of the gland and produce: 
  • HCl following stimulation by acetylcholine 
(bound to the muscarinic M3 receptor), gastrin, 
and histamine (bound to histamine H2 recep-
tor).
  • Intrinsic factor. 
  The cytoplasm of parietal cells shows numer-
ous mitochondria, tubulovesicles and a secre-
tory canaliculus continuous with the lumen of 
the gastric gland. 
  After stimulation, the tubulovesicles fuse with 
the plasma membrane of the secretory cana-
liculus. Carbonic anhydrase and H+,K+-ATPase 
are localized in the microvilli projecting into the 
lumen of the secretory canaliculus.
  Autoantibodies  to H+,K+-dependent ATPase 
and intrinsic factor cause autoimmune gas-
tritis.  Destruction of parietal cells reduces HCl 
in the gastric juice (achlorhydria) and intrinsic 
factor (required for the transport and uptake of 
vitamin B12 by enterocytes in the ileum). 
  Vitamin B12 deﬁciency causes pernicious 
anemia characterized by a decrease in the 

production of red blood cells and the release 
into the blood circulation of large red blood 
cells (megaloblastic anemia). 
  Two additional cell types are the stem cells 
(precursor cells of all glandular cells), and 
gastroenteroendocrine cells (enterochromafﬁn 
cells, see below). 
       
  Based on the motility pattern, the stomach 
can be divided into an orad area (consisting of 
the fundus and a portion of the body, which 
relax during swallowing), and a caudad area 
(consisting of the distal body and the antrum, 
which are involved in the regulation of gastric 
emptying). 
  Helicobacter pylori infection affects the integ-
rity of the protective gastric mucus blanket, en-
ables the aggressive action of pepsin and HCl, 
and of H. pylori–derived cytotoxic proteases 
on the unprotected gastric mucosa.  
  The stages of H. pylori infection are:
  (1) Active phase. H. pylori are highly motile, 
propelled by about six ﬂagella. During this 
time, H. pylori decrease the acidity by produc-
ing ammonia (NH3) by the action of the 
enzyme urease.
  (2) Stationary phase. H. pylori  enter the 
mucus blanket, produce adhesins that attach 
to the apical surfaces of the surface mucous 
epithelial cells containing fucose-binding sites. 
Cell attachment enables adherent H.  pylori 
to obtain nutrients from epithelial cells, which 
undergo necrosis. 
  (3) Colonization phase. Well-nourished H. 
pylori detach from the  mucus-secreting sur-
face cells, replicate within the mucus blanket, 
and attach to sialic acid– containing mucous 
proteins. Bacteria reenter the active phase 
(motility and NH3 production) and reinitiate 
their life cycle.
  Gastritis and peptic ulcer disease develop 
as a consequence of H. pylori infection.      
Hematemesis (blood vomit) or melena (tar-
like black stool) are typical ﬁndings in patients 
with bleeding gastric ulcers.

• Gastroenteroendocrine cells, present in 
the mucosa from the stomach to the colon, 
synthesize peptide hormones, which regulate 
several functions of the digestive system and 
associated glands. 
  Originally, gastroenteroendocrine cells (called 
enterochromafﬁn cells) were regarded as 
members of the APUD system because of 

their property of amino precursor uptake and 
decarboxylation of amino acids. 
  The designation diffuse neuroendocrine 
system (DNES) has replaced the APUD 
designation because not all cells accumulate 
amine precursors.

  Secretin is produced by cells in the 
duodenal glands of Lieberkühn  when the 
gastric content enters the duodenum. Secretin 
stimulates the production of pancreatic and 
Brunner’s gland bicarbonate to regulate the 
duodenal pH by buffering the entering gastric 
acid secretion.
  Gastrin stimulates the production of HCl by 
parietal cells. It is produced by G cells in the 
glands of the pyloric antrum. The release of 
gastrin is regulated by gastrin-releasing pep-
tide, a neuroendocrine mediator. Somatosta-
tin, produced by D cells (adjacent to G cells) 
inhibits the release of gastrin. The low gastric 
pH inhibits further gastrin secretion. 
   Excessive production of gastrin is a char-
acteristic of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 
(parietal cell hyperplasia). 
   A gastrinoma, a gastrin-producing tumor of 
the pyloric antrum or the pancreas, causes 
parietal cell hyperplasia resulting in excessive 
HCl production leading to the development 
of multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers. Low 
gastric pH does not inhibits gastrin secretion 
derived from a gastrinoma. 

  Cholecystokinin stimulates the contraction 
of the gallbladder and relaxes the sphincter 
of Oddi.
  Glucose-dependent insulinotropic pep-
tide, produced in the duodenum, stimulates 
insulin release (insulinotropic effect) when 
glucose is detected in the small intestine. 
   Motilin is released cyclically during fasting 
from the upper small intestine and stimulates 
gastrointestinal motility.
   Ghrelin is produced in the stomach 
(fundus).  Ghrelin stimulates the secretion 
of growth hormone. Ghrelin plasma levels 
increase during fasting, triggering hunger 
by acting on hypothalamic feeding centers.  
Plasma levels of ghrelin are high in patients 
with Prader-Willi syndrome. 
  Severe hypotonia and feeding difﬁculties 
in early infancy, followed by obesity and 
uncontrollable appetite, are characteristics of 
Prader-Willi syndrome.

The main functions of the small intestine are (1) to continue in the duodenum the digestive process initiated 
in the stomach and (2) to absorb digested food after enzymes produced in the intestinal mucosa and the pan-
creas, together with the emulsifying bile produced in the liver, enable uptake of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid 
components. Bacteria, a component of the  microbiota, reside preferentially in the intestinal tract and maintain 
a normal functional relationship with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to prevent the aggression of 
pathogens. This chapter describes the relevant histologic features of the three major segments of the small 
intestine, discusses details of the various mechanisms of defense of the intestinal mucosa, the pathologic and 
clinical consequences of an immune defense breakdown and relevant aspects of colorectal tumorigenesis.

Small intestine
The 4- to 7-meter-long small intestine is divided into 
three sequential segments: 

1. Duodenum.
2. Jejunum,.
3. Ileum.
The  duodenum  is  about  25  cm  in  length,  is 
mainly retroperitoneal, and surrounds the head of 
the  pancreas.  At  its  distal  end,  the  duodenum  is 
continuous with the jejunum, a movable intestinal 
segment suspended by a mesentery. The ileum is the 
continuation of the jejunum.

The  wall  of  the  small  intestine  consists  of  four 

layers (Figures 16-1 to 16-3): 

1. The mucosa.
2. The submucosa.
3. The muscularis.
4. The serosa, or peritoneum. 
As you will see, histologic differences are seen in 
the mucosa and submucosa of the three major por-
tions of the small intestine. The muscularis externa 
and serosa layers are similar.

The peritoneum
The peritoneum is a serous membrane consisting of 
a connective tissue stroma (containing elastic ﬁbers, 
blood and lymphatic vessels, and nerves) lined  by 
mesothelial cells. The parietal peritoneum lines the 
abdominal wall and reﬂects to cover the abdominal 
viscera as the visceral peritoneum. 

The mesentery is a layer of loose connective tissue 
(areolar connective tissue) covered with peritoneum. 
We discuss the histology of the mesentery in Chapter 
4,  Connective Tissue. The  mesentery  attaches  the 
abdominal  viscera  to  the  posterior  abdominal  wall 
and it serves as a conduit of blood and lymphatic ves-
sels and nerves to these organs. The blood vessels are 
components of the subserosal plexus (see Figure 16-
3). During digestion, the lymphatic vessels emerging 
from the walls of the small intestine carry a ﬂuid rich 
in absorbed fat emulsion, or chyle. Numerous lymph 
nodes and adipose tissue are seen in the mesentery. 
The mesentery can be short to anchor certain viscera 
to the abdominal wall, or longer to enable visceral 
displacement.  As  indicated  in  Chapter  15,  Upper 
Digestive Segment, the esophagus lacks a serosa. The 
duodenum and ascending and descending colon at-
tach to the abdominal cavity by the adventitia, a loose 
connective tissue continuous with the surrounding 
stroma of the abdominal wall. 

The omenta and visceral ligaments have a structure 
similar to the mesentery. The greater omentum has 
considerable adipose tissue.

Intestinal wall
The intestinal wall shows an increase in the total 
surface of the mucosa that reﬂects the absorptive 
function of the small intestine. 

Four  degrees  of  folding  amplify  the  absorptive 

surface area of the mucosa (see Figure 16-2): 

1. The plicae circulares  (circular folds; also known 

as the valves of Kerkring).

2. The intestinal villi.
3. The intestinal glands.

        Folds, called plicae circulares (singular plica 
circularis), can be seen in the inner surface of the 
small intestine.
   The folds involve the entire mucosa and a portion of 
the submucosa.
   When compared with the rugae, the folds of the 
stomach, the plicae cannot be completely flattened 
when the intestinal wall is distended.
   Plicae are not present in the upper portions of the 
duodenum, are visible in the jejunum, and are less 
prominent as the ileum approaches the colon.

2
        Villi are finger-like projections of the mucosa 
covering the entire surface of the small intestine.
   The shape and length of the villi differ in the various 
segments of the small intestine.

3
        Crypts, or glands of Lieberkühn (intestinal 
glands) open between villi and extend deep into the 
mucosa down to the muscularis mucosae.

to disappear halfway along the ileum.

The  intestinal  villi  are  ﬁnger-like  projections  of

         The microvascular system of the villus derives 
from two arteriolar systems. One system supplies 
the tip of the villus (capillary villus plexus). The 
second system forms the pericryptal capillary 
plexus. Both plexuses drain into the submucosal 
venule.

2
       A single blind-ending central lymphatic capillary, called a lacteal, is 
present in the core or lamina propria of a villus. The lacteal is the initiation of a 
lymphatic vessel that, just above the muscularis mucosae, forms a lymphatic 
plexus whose branches surround a lymphoid nodule in the submucosa. 
    Efferent lymphatic vessels of the lymphoid nodule anastomose with the lacteal 
and exit the digestive tube together with the blood vessels.

         Both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses consist of

controls motor and sensory activities of the digestive tube.

Mesentery

Vein to the liver (a tributary

 to the portal vein) 

of the villi depends on the degree of distention of the 
intestinal wall and the contraction of smooth muscle 
ﬁbers in the villus core.  

Crypts  of  Lieberkühn,  or  intestinal  glands,  are 
simple  tubular  glands  that  increase  the  intestinal 
surface area. The crypts are formed by invaginations 
of the mucosa between adjacent intestinal villi.

The muscularis mucosae is the boundary between 

the mucosa and submucosa (see Figure 16-3). 

The muscularis consists of inner circular smooth 
muscle and outer longitudinal smooth muscle. The 
muscularis  is  responsible  for  segmentation  and 
peristaltic movement of the contents of the small 
intestine (Figure 16-4). 

A thin layer of loose connective tissue is covered 
by the visceral peritoneum, a serosa layer lined by a 

simple squamous epithelium, or mesothelium. The 
parietal peritoneum covers the inner surface of the 
abdominal wall.

Microcirculation of the small intestine
A difference from the microcirculation of the stomach 
(see Figure 15-9 in Chapter 15, Upper Digestive Seg-
ment) is that the intestinal submucosa is the main 
distribution site of blood and lymphatic ﬂow (see 
Figure 16-3).  

Branches of the submucosal plexus supply capillar-
ies to the muscularis and intestinal mucosa. Arterioles 
derived from the submucosal plexus enter the mucosa 
of the small intestine and give rise to two capillary 
plexuses: 

1. The villus capillary plexus supplies the intestinal

A single blind-ending central lymphatic capillary, 
the lacteal, is present in the core or lamina propria 
of a villus. The lacteal is the initiation of a lymphatic 
vessel that, just above the muscularis mucosae, forms 
a lymphatic plexus whose branches surround a lym-
phoid  nodule  in  the  mucosa-submucosa.  Efferent 
lymphatic vessels of the lymphoid nodule anastomose 
with the lacteal and leave the digestive tube through 
the mesentery, together with the blood vessels.

Innervation and motility of the small intestine
Motility of the small intestine is controlled by the 
autonomic nervous system. The intrinsic autonomic 
nervous system of the small intestine, consisting of 
the submucosal plexus of Meissner and myenteric 
plexus of Auerbach, is similar to that of the stomach 
(see  Figure  15-9  in  Chapter  15,  Upper  Digestive 
Segment).

Neurons  of  the  plexuses  receive  intrinsic  input 
from the mucosa and muscle wall of the small in-
testine and extrinsic input from the central nervous 
system through the parasympathetic (vagus nerve) 
and sympathetic nerve trunks. 

Contraction of the muscularis is coordinated to 

achieve two objectives (see Figure 16-4): 

502

 16. LOWER DIGESTIVE SEGMENT

Intestinal microcirculation and motility

1. To mix and mobilize the contents within an 
intestinal segment. This is accomplished when mus-
cular contraction activity is not coordinated and the 
intestine becomes transiently divided into segments. 
This process is known as segmentation. 

2.  To propel the intestinal contents when there 
is a proximal (orad) contraction coordinated with a 
distal (aborad; Latin ab, from; os, mouth; away from 
the mouth) relaxation. 

When  coordinated  contraction-relaxation  occurs 
sequentially, the intestinal contents are propelled in an 
aborad direction. This process is known as peristalsis 
(Greek peri, around; stalsis, constriction).
 
Histologic  differences  between  the  duodenum, 
jejunum, and ileum
Each  of  the  three  major  anatomic  portions  of  the 
small intestine, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, 
has distinctive features that allow recognition under 
the light microscope (Figure 16-5).

The duodenum extends from the pyloric region of 
the stomach to the junction with the jejunum and 
has the following characteristics: 

1.  It  has  Brunner’s  glands  in  the  submucosa. 
Brunner’s  glands  are  tubuloacinar  mucous  glands
producing  an  alkaline  secretion  (pH  8.8  to  9.3) 
that neutralizes the acidic chyme coming from the 
stomach. 

2. The villi are broad and short (leaﬂike shape).
3. The duodenum is surrounded by an incomplete 
serosa and an extensive adventitia rather than a serosa. 
4. The  duodenum  collects  bile  and  pancreatic 
secretions transported by the common bile duct and 
pancreatic duct, respectively. The sphincter of Oddi
is present at the terminal ampullary portion of the 
two converging ducts. 

5. The base of the crypts of Lieberkühn may con-

tain Paneth cells. 

The jejunum has the following characteristics: 
1. It has long ﬁnger-like villi and a well-developed 

lacteal in the core of the villus. 

2. The jejunum does not contain Brunner’s glands

in the submucosa. 

3.  Peyer’s  patches  in  the  lamina  propria  may  be 
present but they are not predominant in the jejunum. 
Peyer’s patches are a characteristic feature of the ileum.
4. Paneth cells are found at the base of the crypts 

of Lieberkühn. 

The  ileum  has  a  prominent  diagnostic  feature: 
Peyer’s patches, lymphoid follicles (also called nod-
ules) found in the mucosa and part of the submu-
cosa. The lack of Brunner’s glands and the presence 
of shorter ﬁnger-like villi, when compared with the 
jejunum, are additional landmarks of the ileum. As 
in the jejunum, Paneth cells are found at the base of 
the crypts of Lieberkühn.

Villi and crypts of Lieberkühn
The intestinal mucosa, including the crypts of Lieber-
kühn, are lined by a simple columnar epithelium 
containing ﬁve major cell types (Figure 16-6): 

1. Enterocytes or absorptive cells. 
2. Goblet cells.
3. Enteroendocrine cells.
4. Paneth cells.
5. Intestinal stem cells. 
Enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and intestinal 
stem cells are found in the crypts of Lieberkühn (see 
Figure  16-6).  We  discuss  Paneth  cells  within  the 
context of the protection mechanisms of the small 
intestine.

Enterocytes: Absorptive cells 
The absorptive intestinal cell or enterocyte has an 
apical domain with a prominent brush border (also 
called a striated border), ending on a zone, called the 
terminal web, which contains transverse cytoskeletal 
ﬁlaments. The brush border of each absorptive cell 
contains about 3000 closely packed microvilli, which 
increase the surface luminal area 30-fold.

The length of a microvillus ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 
(cid:43)m. The core of a microvillus (Figure 16-7) contains 
a bundle of  20 to 40 parallel actin ﬁlaments cross-
linked by ﬁmbrin and villin. The actin bundle core 
is anchored to the plasma membrane by formin (pro-
tein of the cap), myosin I, and the calcium-binding 
protein calmodulin.  Each actin bundle projects into 
the apical portion of the cell as a rootlet, which is 

cross-linked by an intestinal isoform of spectrin to 
an adjacent rootlet. The end portion of the rootlet 
attaches  to  cytokeratin-containing  intermediate 
ﬁlaments. Spectrin and cytokeratins form part of the 
terminal web. The terminal web is responsible for 
maintaining the upright position and shape of the 
microvillus and anchoring the actin rootlets.

A  surface  coat  or  glycocalyx,  consisting  of  gly-
coproteins  as  integral  components  of  the  plasma 
membrane, covers each microvillus. 

Trafﬁcking of sugars and peptides in enterocytes
The microvilli, forming a brush border, contain in-
tramembranous enzymes, including lactase, maltase, 
and  sucrase  (Figure  16-8). These  oligosaccharides 
reduce carbohydrates to monosaccharides, which can 
be transported into the enterocyte by carrier proteins. 
Glucose and galactose cross the apical membrane with 
the help of a Na+-dependent carrier system: involving 
the sugar glucose/galactose transporter-1 (SGLT-1). 
Na+-K+  ATPase  drives  SGLT-1.  Fructose  (derived, 
together with glucose, from the breakdown of sucrose) 
enters and leaves the enterocyte by passive diffusion.
A genetic defect in lactase prevents the absorption 
of lactose-rich milk, causing diarrhea (lactose intoler-
ance). Lactose is converted by intestinal bacteria to 
lactic acid, methane, and  H2 gas causing an osmotic 
diarrhea by drawing water into the intestinal lumen. A 
lactose-H2 breath test is positive in individuals with 
lactase deﬁciency. H2 enters the blood circulation and 
expired by the lungs.

Therefore, the brush border not only increases the 
absorptive surface of enterocytes but is also the site 
where enzymes are involved in the terminal digestion 
of carbohydrates and proteins. 

Final breakdown of oligopeptides, initiated by the 
action  of  gastric  pepsin,  is  extended  by  pancreatic 
trypsin,  chymotrypsin,  elastase,  and  carboxypepti-
dases A and B. 

Enterokinase and aminopeptidase, localized in the 
microvilli, degrade oligopeptides into dipeptides, tri-
peptides, and amino acids before entering the entero-
cyte across symporter channels together with Na+. 
Cytoplasmic  peptidases  degrade  dipeptides  and 
tripeptides into amino acids, which then diffuse or 
are transported by a carrier-mediated process across 
the basolateral plasma membrane into the blood. 

In summary, concerning carbohydrates, they can 
only be absorbed as monosaccharides. A two-step pro-
cess enables the absorption of glucose and galactose 
monosaccharides: active transport across the apical 
membrane of the enterocyte involving SGLT-1, fol-
lowed by transport across the basolateral membrane 
by facilitated diffusion.

The absorption of amino acids and di- and tripeptides 
occurs across symporter channels together with 
Na+. The transport is active.

Glucose and galactose enter the enterocyte using an Na+-dependent carrier system 
(sugar glucose/galactose transporter-1 [SGLT-1]) for glucose and galactose. The 
transport is active (driven by Na+-K+ ATPase). Fructose enters and leaves the 
enterocyte by facilitated diffusion.

Protein digestion starts in the stomach in the presence of pepsin 
derived from the precursor pepsinogen secreted by chief cells. Pepsin 
activity ends in the alkaline environment of the duodenum. Pancreatic 
proteases, endopeptidases and exopeptidases, continue proteolysis.
    Trypsinogen is activated to trypsin by enterokinase, located on the 
microvilli. Active trypsin, in turn, activates the bulk of trypsinogen.
    Chymotrypsinogen and proelastase are activated to chymotrypsin 
and elastase, respectively. Carboxypeptidases A and B derive from 
procarboxypeptidase A and B precursors. 
   Trypsin plays a significant role in the activation and inactivation of 
pancreatic proenzymes. Tripeptides in the cytosol are digested by 
cytoplasmic peptidases into amino acids.

Starch, sucrose, lactose, and maltose are the main dietary 
carbohydrates. Starch consists of amylose (a glucose polymer) and 
amylopectin (a plant starch). Sucrose is a glucose-fructose 
disaccharide. Lactose is a galactose-glucose disaccharide. Maltose 
is a glucose dimer. Salivary (cid:95)-amylase initiates the digestion of 
starch in the mouth. Pancreatic (cid:95)-amylase completes the digestion 
in the small intestine. Other major dietary sugars are hydrolyzed by 
oligosaccharidases (sucrase, lactase, isomaltase) present in the 
plasma membrane of the microvilli. 
    Cellulose is not digested in the human small intestine because 
cellulase is not present. Cellulose accounts for the undigested 
dietary fiber.

breakdown  of  dietary  lipids  into  fatty  acids  and 
monoglycerides, which can diffuse across the plasma 
membrane of the microvilli and the apical plasma 
membrane of the enterocyte. Details of the process 
of lipid absorption are depicted in Figure 16-9.

We address now in detail how enterocytes handle 
cholesterol.  Cholesterol  is  an  essential  structural 
component  of  cell  membranes.  Body  cholesterol 
derives  from  two  sources:  diet  and  new  synthesis 
from acetyl CoA through the mevalonate pathway.  
Dietary cholesterol is initially transported from the 
intestine to the liver and then distributed throughout 
the body. Newly synthesized cholesterol leaves the 
smooth  endoplasmic  reticulum  by  a  non-vesicular 
transport  mechanism  bypassing  the  endoplasmic 

reticulum-Golgi transport pathway and rapidly tar-
geted to the plasma membrane. We discuss mitochon-
drial cholesterol transport in Chapter 19, Endocrine 
System, within the context of steroidogenesis in the 
adrenal cortex. 

Enterocytes and hepatocytes package cholesterol, 
along with triglycerides, into lipoproteins (chylomi-
crons). Chylomicrons consist of triglycerides (85%), 
phospholipids (9%), cholesterol  (4%) and proteins 
(2%, including the apolipoprotein APOB48). 

Cholesterol is secreted from the liver into the bile 
as cholesterol or bile acids, entering the small intes-
tine.  Cholesterol  and  bile  salts  can  be  reabsorbed 
and return to the liver by the enterohepatic cycle or 
excreted into the feces.

         An emulsion of lipid droplets in the intestinal lumen is broken down 
to fatty acids and monoglycerides by pancreatic lipase in the presence 
of bile salts. Fat breakdown products combine with bile salts to form 
micelles (2 nm in diameter). The movement of the villi is an important 
part of the lipid absorption process. Villi movement occurs by induced 
contraction triggered by the submucosal Meissner's nerve plexus.

   Enzymes required for the resynthesis of

         Resynthesized triglycerides are transported to

Figure 16-10 illustrates the relevant steps of cho-
lesterol trafﬁcking in enterocytes. As in the absorp-
tion of dietary lipids, cholesterol is solubilized in the 
intestinal lumen into micelles by bile acids to facilitate 
micellar movement through the diffusion barrier of 
the enterocytes. 

Note in Figure 16-10 that the ABCG5/ABCG8 
(ATP-binding  cassette,  ABC)  heterodimeric  trans-
porters at the apical domain of enterocytes export 
absorbed cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen, 
a step that facilitates the removal of cholesterol from 
the  body.  Mutations  in  ABCG5  or  ABCG8  genes 
cause sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder 
in which cholesterol and plant sterols accumulate in 
the circulation leading to premature cardiovascular 
disease.

In  contrast,  the  NPC1L1  (Niemann-Pick  C1-
like-1)  protein,  located  also  at  the  apical  domain, 
enables the uptake of cholesterol esteriﬁed by ACAT2 
(Acyl CoA cholesterol acyltransferase isoform 2). 

Esteriﬁed cholesterol  becomes part of chylomicron 
particles,  assembled  in  the  smooth  endoplasmic 

Central lacteal in the core of the villus 

reticulum in the presence of APOB48 apoprotein, 
triglycerides  and  MTP  (microsomal  triglyceride 
protein), which transfers cholesterol esters from the 
smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes to nascent 
APOB 48 apolipoproteins.

The newly assembled chylomicron leaves the en-
doplasmic reticulum in COPII-coated vesicles and 
released through the Golgi apparatus into the baso-
lateral domain of the enterocyte to reach a lymphatic 
capillary in the lamina propria of the intestinal villus.
Knowledge  of  the  cholesterol  transport  pathway 
can  help  you  understand  its  regulation  in  patients 
with  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease.  For 
example,  the  pharmacologic  targeting  of  ACAT2 
can decrease the esteriﬁcation of cholesterol. About 
70-80% of cholesterol entering the lymphatic system 
is esteriﬁed.

Goblet cells
Goblet cells are columnar mucus-secreting cells scat-
tered among enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium 
(see Figure 16-7).

propria 

Goblet cells have two domains: 
1. A cup- or goblet-shaped apical domain contain-
ing large mucus granules that are discharged on the 
surface of the epithelium.

2. A narrow basal domain, which attaches to the 
basal  lamina. The  basal  domain  houses  the  rough 
endoplasmic  reticulum  and  Golgi  apparatus,  in 
which the protein portion of mucus is produced and 
transported, and the nucleus 

The Golgi apparatus, which adds oligosaccharide 
groups to mucus, is prominent and situated above 
the basally located nucleus.  

The  secretory  product  of  goblet  cells  contains 
glycoproteins (80% carbohydrate and 20% protein) 
released by exocytosis. 

On the surface of the epithelium, the mucus hy-
drates to form a protective gel coat to shield the 
epithelium from mechanical abrasion and bacterial 
invasion by concentrating speciﬁc antimicrobial pro-
teins, including defensins and cathelicidins. 

Enteroendocrine cells
In  addition  to  its  digestive  function,  the  gastroin-
testinal  tract  is  the  largest  diffuse  endocrine  gland 
in the body. 

As in the stomach (see Chapter 15, Upper Diges-
tive Segment), enteroendocrine cells secrete peptide 
hormones controlling several functions of the gastro-
intestinal system. 

The location and function of gastrin-, secretin-, 
and cholecystokinin-secreting cells are summarized 
in Figure 16-11.

Intestinal stem cells
Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) reside in a niche at the 
base of the crypts, close to Paneth cells (see Figures 
16-6 and 16-17). 

Adult ISC, identiﬁed by the protein marker Lgr5 
(for leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein cou-
pled receptor 5), can differentiate into the secretory 
goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells 
and the absorptive enterocytes lining the epithelium 
of the small intestine. 

ISCs  are  multipotent  and  capable  of  long-term 
self-renewal  as  long  as  they  remain  at  the  crypt 
niche. Presumably ISCs are subject to positional cues 
derived from the microenvironment of the niche.

As clusters of enterocytes and goblet cells divide 
and differentiate, they migrate along the walls of the 
crypts and villi until they reach the tip of the villus 
where they are eventually shed.

Following injury, cells committed to the intesti-
nal secretory pathway and expressing Delta-like 1 
(DLL1), a ligand of the Notch family of proteins, 
can return to the stem cell compartment and revert 
into multipotent ISCs. At this point, you may like 
to take another look at Box 3-D in Chapter 3, Cell 
Signaling, to review the Notch signaling pathway.

 

Protection of the small intestine
The  large  surface  area  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract, 
about 200 m2 in humans, is vulnerable to resident 
microorganisms, called microbiota, and potentially 
harmful microorganisms and dietary antigens. Micro-
biota includes bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses.
We discuss in Chapter 15, Upper Digestive Seg-
ment, the role of the mucus blanket in the protection 
of  the  surface  of  the  stomach  during  Helicobacter 
pylori infection. 

In the small and large intestines, goblet cells secrete 
mucin glycoproteins assembled into a viscous gel-like 
blanket limiting direct bacterial contact with entero-
cytes. When the blanket lacks one of its components, 
mucin glycoprotein 2 (MIC2), spontaneous intestinal 
inﬂammation occurs. 

Several defensive mechanisms operate in the ali-
mentary tube to limit tissue invasion of pathogens and

avoid  potentially  harmful  overreactions  that  could 
damage intestinal tissues. The defensive mechanisms 
include: 

1. The intestinal tight junction barrier, formed by 
apical tight junctions linking enterocytes. The barrier 
of pathogens is monitored by the immune–compe-
tent cells residing in the subjacent lamina propria. 
2. Peyer’s patches and associated M cells,  regarded 

as the immune sensors of the small intestine.

3. Polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA), a secretory 
product of plasma cells located in the lamina propria, 
reaching the intestinal lumen by the mechanism of 
transcytosis.

4.  Paneth  cells,  whose  bacteriostatic  secretions 
control the resident microbiota of the small intestine. 
In addition, we need to keep in mind the defensive 
roles of the acidity of the gastric juice, that inacti-
vates  ingested  microorganism,  and  the  propulsive 
intestinal motility (peristalsis), that prevents bacte-
rial colonization. 

Intestinal tight junction barrier
Intestinal tight junctions link adjacent enterocytes 
and provide a barrier function impermeable to most 
hydrophilic solutes in absence of speciﬁc transport-
ers. 

Tight  junctions  establish  a  separation  between 

the  intestinal  luminal  content  and  the  mucosal 
immune  function  that  occurs  within  the  lamina 
propria. Plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast 
cells and macrophages are present in the intestinal 
lamina propria. 

Claudin  and occludin  are  two  transmembrane 
proteins of tight junctions that regulate solute perme-
ability of the transcellular pathway. Flux of dietary 
proteins  and  bacterial  lipopolysaccharides  across 
leaky  tight  junctions  can  increase  in  the  presence 
of  tumor  necrosis  factor  ligand  and  interferon-(cid:97), 
two  proinﬂammatory  cytokines  that  affect  tight 
junction integrity. 

Many diseases associated with intestinal epithelial 
dysfunction, including inﬂammatory bowel disease 
and intestinal ischemia, are associated with increased 
levels of tumor necrosis factor ligand.

A minor defect of the tight junction barrier can al-
low bacterial products or dietary antigens to cross the 
epithelium and enter the lamina propria. Antigens 
can bind to Toll-like receptor (TLR)  on the surface 
of dendritic cells. We discuss  TLR in Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System  (see Box 10-A). 

Dendritic cells migrate to a local mesentery lymph 
node and the antigen is presented to naïve T cells by 
the major histocompatibility complex to determine 
their  differentiation  into  T  helper  1  (TH1)  and  T

cosa immune cell activation response proceeds un-
checked, proinﬂammatory cytokines will continue 
enhancing further leakage across the tight junction 

 Box 16-A |  Development of Peyer’s patches  

•  Hematopoietic cells aggregate in the small intestine to form the primordia of 
Peyer’s patches.  A subset of hematopoietic cells expresses receptor tyrosine 
kinase (RET), which is also essential for the development of the enteric 
nervous system (submucosal plexus of Meissner and myenteric plexus of 
Auerbach). 
•  The protooncogene Ret encodes RET, expressed in tissues and tumors 
derived from the neural crest and neuroectoderm.
•  The RET ligand artemin (ARTN), a member of the glial cell line–derived 
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands, regulates the development  of the 
nervous and lymphoid system of the intestine. However, a failure to develop 
Peyer’s patches in Ret mutant mice is independent of the development of the 
enteric nervous system. 
•  As discussed later in this chapter, a deﬁciency in the Ret/ligand signaling 
pathway is the cause of distal colonic aganglionosis  (Hirschsprung’s disease). 
This pathway is also critical for the formation of the enteric hematopoietic 
Peyer’s patches system.

inﬂammatory diseases.

Peyer’s patches
Peyer’s  patches,  the  main  component  of  the  gut-
associated lymphoid tissue  (GALT), are specialized 
lymphoid follicles found predominantly in the intes-
tinal mucosa and part of the submucosa of the  ileum
(see Box 16-A). GALTs participate in the uptake of 
antigens  and  their  exposure  to  antigen-presenting 
cells. Therefore,  these  structures  serve  important 
functions that can lead to inﬂammation or tolerance. 
The microbiota is involved in  the normal develop-
ment and maturation of GALTs. In the fetus, lym-
phoid tissue inducer cells stimulate the development 
of Peyer’s patches in the absence of microbiota.

Peyer’s patches consist of cells able to take up and 
transport luminal antigens and bacteria to antigen-
presenting cells leading to immune tolerance or an 
inﬂammatory reaction against pathogens.  

Peyer’s patches are regarded the immune sensors of 
the small intestine. An equivalent to Peyer’s patches 
in the large intestine are the isolated lymphoid fol-
licles (ILFs), requiring TLRs and nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) to become acti-
vated. TLRs are extracellular sensors and NODs are 
cytoplasmic sensors. We come back to NOD2 in our 
discussion of the bacteriostatic Paneth cells.

intraepithelial pockets. 

The population of M cells increases rapidly in the 
presence of pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal lu-
men (for example, Salmonella typhimurium). When 
confronting  Salmonella,  the  microfolds  of  M  cells 
change into large rufﬂes and, within 30 to 60 min-
utes, M cells undergo necrosis and the population 
of M cells is depleted. Poliovirus, the pathogen of 
poliomyelitis, uses the Peyer’s patches to replicate.

2. Dendritic cell, extending cytoplasmic processes 
between tight junctions linking enterocytes (see Fig-
ure 16-14). 

Lymphoid  follicles  have  a  germinal  center  that 
contains IgA-positive B cells, CD4+ T cells, antigen-
presenting cells and follicular dendritic cells. A few 
plasma cells are present in the Peyer’s patches. The 
subepithelial dome contains B cells, T cells, macro-
phages, and dendritic cells.   

Antigens  in  the  intestinal  lumen  activate TLRs 

expressed  by  enterocytes  (see  Figure  16-14). TLR-
antigen interaction stimulates the production of B 
cell-activating factor (BAF) and cytokines to activate 
the production of immunoglobulin (Ig) A by plasma 
cells located in the lamina propria and Peyer’s patches. 
  Intestinal  antigens,  bound  to  immunoglobulin 
receptors  on  the  surface  of  B  cells,  interact  with 
antigen-presenting  cells  at  the  subepithelial  dome 
region. Antigens are presented to follicular dendritic 
cells and CD4+ T cells to initiate an immune reaction. 
In  summary,  Peyer’s  patches  have  the  ability  to 
transport luminal antigens and microorganisms and 
respond to them by inducing immune tolerance or 
a systemic immune defense response. An example of 
the functional deﬁciency of Peyer’s patches is Crohn’s 
disease, an inﬂammatory bowel disease characterized 
by chronic or relapsing inﬂammation.

Intestinal mucus blanket  

In the intestine, goblet cells secrete 
mucin glycoproteins that form a blanket 
consisting of stratified outer and inner 
layers on the surface of the epithelium. 
   Microorganisms predominate in the 
outer mucus layer, whereas the inner 
mucus layer, resistant to 
microorganism penetration, contains 
antimicrobial proteins secreted by

lumen, the respiratory epithelium, the lactating mam-
mary gland, and salivary glands. Most plasma cells are 
present in the lamina propria of the intestinal villi, 
together with lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, 
and macrophages.

Polymeric IgA molecules secreted by plasma cells 
are transported from the lamina propria to the intes-
tinal lumen by a transcytosis mechanism consisting 
of the following steps (Figure 16-15): 

1. Polymeric IgA is secreted as a dimeric molecule 

joined by a peptide called the J chain. 

2. Polymeric IgA binds to a speciﬁc receptor, called 
the  polymeric  immunoglobulin  receptor  (pIgR), 
available on the basal surfaces of the enterocytes. The 
pIgR has an attached secretory component. 

3. The polymeric IgA–pIgR–secretory component 
complex is internalized and transported across the 
cell to the apical surface of the epithelial cell. 

4.  At  the  apical  surface,  the  complex  is  cleaved 
enzymatically and the polymeric IgA-secretory com-
ponent complex is released into the intestinal lumen 

as secreted IgA (SIgA). The secretory component pro-
tects the dimeric IgA from proteolytic degradation.  
5. IgA attaches to bacteria and soluble antigens, 
preventing a direct damaging effect to intestinal  cells 
and penetration into the lamina propria. 

How  are  plasma  cells  induced  to  produce  poly-

meric IgA? 

When TLR on enterocytes is activated by micro-
biota, they secrete B cell-activating factor (BAF) and 
a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). 

In the lamina propria, BAF and APRIL induce the 
differentiation of B cells into IgA-producing plasma 
cells (see Figure 16-15).  

In addition, the microbiota instructs enterocytes 
through thymic stromal lymphoprotein (TSLP) to 
engage dendritic cells in the lamina propria to secrete 
BAF and APRIL and induce the differentiation of B 
cells into plasma cells.

One last point: IgA regulates the composition and 
the function of the intestinal microbiota by affecting 
bacterial gene expression. By this mechanism, IgA

Patients with defects in NOD2 (for 
nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain-containing protein 2) have 
lower expression of (cid:95)-defensins 
by Paneth cells and severe 
intestinal inflammation. Low levels 
of (cid:95)-defensin proteins allow 
increased association of 
microorganisms with the epithelial 
cell surface and may contribute to 
Crohn’s disease, a chronic 
inflammatory bowel disease. 

       Crypts of Lieberkühn are

keeps a congenial relationship between the host and 
the microbiota. 

In our discussion of Peyer’s patches, we indicated 
that M cells express IgA receptors allowing the uptake 
of IgA–bound bacteria. As you realize, luminal SIgA 
not only immobilize bacteria but also redirects them 
to the M cells  for internalization and disposal.

Paneth cells
Enterocytes  and  Paneth  cells  in  particular  secrete 
proteins to limit bacteria pathogenic challenges. We 
discuss in Chapter 11. Integumentary System, how 
epithelial antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) protect skin 
surfaces  against  microorganisms. We  continue  the 
discussion within the context of  the antimicrobial 
defense  of  the  intestinal  mucosa  involving  Paneth 
cells and enterocytes.

Most AMPs inactivate or kill bacteria directly by 
enzymatic  degradation  of  the  bacterial  wall  or  by 
disrupting the bacterial inner membrane. A group 
of  AMPs  deprive  bacteria  of  essential  heavy  metal 
such as iron. 

AMPs produced by Paneth cells and enterocytes are 
retained in the intestinal mucus blanket produced 
by goblet cells. Therefore, the mucus layer protects 
the intestinal mucosa by two mechanisms:

1. By creating a barrier that limits direct access of 

luminal bacteria to the epithelium.

2.  By  concentrating  AMPs  near  the  enterocyte 
surface. AMPs are virtually absent from the luminal 
content.   

Paneth cells are present at the base of the crypts 
of Lieberkühn and have a lifetime of about 20 days. 
The  pyramid-shaped  Paneth  cells  have  a  basal  do-
main containing the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 
The apical region shows numerous protein granules 
representing a diverse array of AMPs, an indication of 
the microbial diversity and impending threats (Figures 
16-16 and 16-17). 

Paneth cells produce several AMPs:
1.  Defensins  ((cid:95)-defensin  5  [DEFA5]  and    (cid:95)-

defensin 6 [DEFA6] in humans)

2. C-type lectins, including regenerating islet-
derived protein 3(cid:97) (REG3(cid:97)), also known as hepa-
tointestinal protein/pancreatitis-associated protein 
(HIP/PAP). 

 3. Lysozyme and phospholipase A2 (PLA2).
4. Angiogenin 4 (ANG4).
(cid:95)-Defensins  (2–3  kd)  target  Gram-positive  and 
Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa 
to produce membrane disruption by the formation of 
defensin pores. Pores cause swelling and membrane 
rupture enabling the entrance of water into the patho-
gen.  Defensins can also be chemotactic to CD4+ T 
cells,  CD8+ T  cells,  monocytes,  and  macrophages 
and modulate an inﬂammatory response. Defensins 

516

Crohn’s disease

enhance the recruitment of dendritic cells to the site 
of infection and facilitate the uptake of antigens by 
forming defensin-antigen complexes.

Like  all  C-type  lectins,  the  carbohydrate-recog-
nition domain of REG3(cid:97)(cid:13)HIP/PAP (15 kd) binds 
to the glycan chain of peptidoglycan present in the 
bacterial  cell  wall  of  Gram-positive  bacteria  and 
causes wall disruption. Peptidoglycan is present in 
bacteria but not in human cells.  

Recall  that  selectins,  a  member  of  the  group  of  
Ca2+-dependent  cell  adhesion  molecules,  belong 
to the C-type lectin family that have carbohydrate-
recognition domains.  

Lysozyme  is  a  proteolytic  enzyme  that  cleaves  
glycosidic linkages that maintain the integrity of cell 
wall peptidoglycan. PLA2 kills bacteria by hydrolysis 
of phospholipids in the bacterial membrane.

Paneth cells secrete ANG4, an RNAse with bac-

tericidal properties.  

It is important to emphasize that the expression and 
function of AMPs are highly regulated by the pres-
ence or absence of the microbiota (see Figure 16-16). 

In the presence of microorganisms:
1. TLR in enterocytes controls the expression of  
REG3(cid:97)/HIP/PAP through the TLR-signaling adap-
tor myeloid-differentiation primary response protein 
88 (MYD88). 

2. Cytoplasmic NOD2, expressed by Paneth cells, 
controls the expression of (cid:95)-defensins when it binds 
to an internalized  peptidoglycan peptide fragment 
(muramyl dipeptide, MDP) and activates the tran-
scription factor NF-(cid:103)B. 

Note  that  NOD2  is  in  a  strategic  position  to 
contribute  to  immunogenic  tolerance  toward  the 
microbiota  when  confronting  MDP:  NOD2  can 
also limit the development of a CD4+ T cell-initiated 
immune response. However, (cid:95)-defensins can be ex-
pressed independently of the microbiota by activation 
of  the transcription factor TCF4.

Defensins  are  produced  continuously  or  in  re-
sponse  to  microbial  products  or  proinﬂammatory 
cytokines (for example, TNF ligand). As mentioned 
in  our  discussion  on  the  intestinal  tight  junction 
barrier, TNF ligand(cid:3)is a proinﬂammatory cytokine 
produced  in  response  to  diverse  infectious  agents 
and tissue injury.

In summary, enterocytes and Paneth cells produce 
a diverse group of AMPs that directly kill or inhibit 
the growth of pathogenic microorganisms that can 
contribute to inﬂammatory bowel diseases.

   

Pathology: Inﬂammatory bowel diseases  
Inﬂammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative coli-
tis and Crohn’s disease. Both are clinically character-
ized by diarrhea, pain, and periodic relapses.

intestine. Crohn’s disease affects any segment of the 
intestinal tract. 

Crohn’s disease is a chronic inﬂammatory process 
involving the terminal ileum but is also observed in 
the large intestine. Inﬂammatory cells (neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, and macrophages) produce cytokines 
that cause damage to the intestinal mucosa (Figure 
16-18).

The  initial  alteration  of  the  intestinal  mucosa 
consists in the inﬁltration of  neutrophils into the 
crypts  of  Lieberkühn. This  process  results  in  the 
destruction of the intestinal glands by the formation 
of crypt abscesses and the progressive atrophy and 
ulceration of the mucosa.

The chronic inﬂammatory process inﬁltrates the 
submucosa and muscularis. Abundant accumulation 
of lymphocytes forms aggregates of cells, or granulo-
mas, a typical feature of Crohn’s disease. 

Major complications of the disease are occlusion of 
the intestinal lumen by ﬁbrosis and the formation 
of ﬁstulas in other segments of the small intestine, 
and  intestinal  perforation.  Segments  affected  by 
Crohn’s disease are separated by normal stretches of 
intestinal segments.

The cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown. There is 
increasing evidence suggesting that the disease arises 
from dysregulated interactions between microorgan-
isms and the intestinal epithelium involving NOD2. 
Patients  with  intestinal  bowel  disease  have  an 
increased number of bacteria associated with the epi-
thelial cell surface, suggesting a failure of mechanisms 
limiting direct contact between microorganisms and 
the epithelium. 

A contributing factor is the reactive immune re-
sponse of the intestinal mucosa determined by an ab-
normal signaling exchange with the resident bacteria 
(microbiota). In genetically susceptible individuals, 
inﬂammatory bowel disease occurs when the mucosal 
immune machinery regards the microbiota present 
in normal and healthy individuals as pathogenic and 
triggers an immune response. 

As  discussed  (see  Figure  16-12),  cytokines  pro-
duced by helper T cells within the intestinal mucosa 
cause a proinﬂammatory response that characterizes 
inﬂammatory bowel disease. In Crohn’s disease, type 
1 helper cells (TH1 cells) produce TNF ligand and 
interferon-(cid:97).  Because TNF ligand is a proinﬂamma-
tory cytokine, antibodies to this cytokine are being 
administered to patients with Crohn’s disease to at-
tenuate proinﬂammatory activity.     

Clinical signiﬁcance: Malabsorption syndromes 
Malabsorption syndromes are characterized by a deﬁ-
cit in the absorption of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, 
salts, and water by the mucosa of the small intestine.

 Ulcerative colitis affects the mucosa of the large 

Malabsorption syndromes can be caused by:

Large intestine

Figure 16-19. Large intestine

Large intestine

The layers of the large intestine are the same as those in the small 
intestine: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa.
    The main function of the mucosa is the absorption of water, 
sodium, vitamins, and minerals. The transport of sodium is active 
(energy-dependent), causing water to move along an osmotic 
gradient. As a result, the fluid chyme entering the colon is 
concentrated into semisolid feces. Potassium and bicarbonate are 
secreted into the lumen of the colon.
    The absorptive capacity of the colon favors the uptake of many 
substances, including sedatives, anesthetics, and steroids. This 
property is of considerable therapeutic importance when 
medication cannot be administered through the mouth (for 
example, because of vomiting).

Tubular glands, or crypts of Lieberkühn, are oriented 
perpendicular to the long axis of the colon, are much 
deeper than in the small intestine, and have a higher 
proportion of goblet cells.

Mucosa

Muscularis mucosae

Mucosa of the large intestine

The mucosa of the colon is free of folds and villi. 
    Four cell types are present in the surface epithelium and 
tubular glands: 
   1. Simple columnar absorptive cells with apical microvilli 
(striated apical border).  
    2. Predominant goblet cells. 
    3. Stem cells at the base of the tubular glands of
      Lieberkühn, which give rise to absorptive and goblet
      cells. 
    4. Enteroendocrine cells. 
    The intestinal tubular glands are longer than in the small 
intestine (0.4 to 0.6 mm).  
    Lymphatic follicles can be seen in the lamina propria just 
under the muscularis mucosae, extending into the 
submucosa.

Submucosa

Muscularis 

1.  Abnormal  digestion  of  fats  and  proteins  by 
pancreatic diseases (pancreatitis or cystic ﬁbrosis) or 
lack of solubilization of fats by defective bile secre-
tion (hepatic disease or obstruction of the ﬂow of bile 
into the duodenum).

2. Enzymatic abnormalities at the brush border, 
where disaccharidases and peptidases cannot hydro-

lyze carbohydrates (lactose intolerance) and proteins, 
respectively.

3.  A  defect  in  the  transepithelial  transport  by 

enterocytes.

tems. Anemia occurs when  vitamin B12, iron, and

typical clinical feature of malabsorption syndromes 
is diarrhea.

Large intestine
The  large  intestine  is  formed  by  several  successive 
segments: 

1. The cecum, projecting from which is the ap-

pendix.

2. The  ascending,  transverse,  and  descending 

colon.

3. The sigmoid colon.
4. The rectum.
5. The anus. 
Plicae circulares and intestinal villi are not found 
beyond the ileocecal valve. Numerous openings of 
the straight tubular glands or crypts of Lieberkühn 
are characteristic of the mucosa of the colon (Figure 
16-19). 

The  lining  of  the  tubular  glands  of  the  colon 
consists of the following (Figures 16-20 and 16-21): 
1. A surface simple columnar  epithelium formed 
by absorptive enterocytes and goblet cells. Entero-
cytes have short apical microvilli, and the cells par-
ticipate in the transport of ions and water. All regions 
of the colon absorb Na+ and Cl– ions facilitated by 
plasma  membrane  channels  that  are  regulated  by 
mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone increases the num-
ber of Na+ channels and increases the absorption of 

Na+.  Na+  ions  entering  the  absorptive  enterocytes 
are extruded by an Na+ pump. Goblet cells secrete 
mucus to lubricate the mucosal surface and serve as 
a protective barrier. 

2.  A  glandular  epithelium,  lining  the  glands  or 
crypts  of  Lierberkühn,  consists  of  enterocytes  and 
predominant goblet cells, stem cells, and dispersed 
enteroendocrine cells. Paneth cells may be present 
in the cecum. 

 A lamina propria and a muscularis mucosae are 
present,  as  are  isolated  lymphoid  follicles  (ILFs) 
penetrating the submucosa. Glands are not present 
in the submucosa. Unlike Peyer’s patches, ILFs are 
not associated with M cells.

The  muscularis  has  a  particular  feature: The 
bundles of its outer longitudinal layer fuse to form 
the  taeniae  coli. The  taeniae  coli  consist  of    three 
longitudinally  oriented  ribbon-like  bands,  each  1 
cm wide. The contraction of  the taeniae coli and 
circular muscle layer draws the colon into saccula-
tions called haustra. 

The serosa has scattered sacs of adipose tissue, the 
appendices  epiploicae,  which  is  a  unique  feature, 
together with the haustra, of the colon.

The appendix
The  appendix  (Figure  16-22)  is  a  diverticulum  of 
the cecum and has layers similar to those of the large 
intestine. The characteristic features of the appendix 
are  the  lymphoid  tissue,  represented  by  multiple

Lymphatic follicles are observed  in the mucosa 
and submucosa. The follicles resemble the 
lymphatic follicles surrounding the crypts of the 
palatine tonsils.  A clear difference is that the 
tubular glands lined by predominant goblet 
cells are not seen in the tonsils.

Tubular glands are 
lined by abundant 

goblet cells 

lymphatic follicles, and lymphocytes inﬁltrating the 
lamina propria. Lymphatic follicles extend into the 
mucosa and submucosa and disrupt the continuity 
of the muscularis mucosae. The submucosa contains 
adipocytes  and  dense  irregular  connective  tissue. 
The  inner  circular  layers  of  the  muscularis  is  well 
developed  in  contrast  with  the  outer  longitudinal 
layer covered by the serosa. 

The rectum
The rectum, the terminal portion of the intestinal 
tract, is a continuation of the sigmoid colon. The 
rectum consists of two parts (Figure 16-23): 

1. The upper part, or rectum proper.
2. The lower part, or anal canal. 
The mucosa is thicker, with prominent veins, and 
the crypts of Lieberkühn are longer (0.7 mm) than 
in the small intestine and lined predominantly by 
goblet cells. At the level of the anal canal, the crypts 
gradually disappear and the serosa is replaced by an 
adventitia.

A characteristic  feature of the mucosa of the anal 
canal  are  8  to  10  longitudinal  anal  columns. The 
base of the anal columns is the pectinate line. The 
anal columns are connected at their base by valves, 
corresponding  to  transverse  folds  of  the  mucosa.  

Small  pockets,  called  anal  sinuses,  or  crypts,  are 
found behind the valves. Anal mucous glands open 
into each sinus.

The valves and sinuses prevent leakage from the 
anus. When  the  canal  is  distended  with  feces,  the 
columns,  sinuses,  and  valves  ﬂatten,  and  mucus  is 
discharged from the sinuses to lubricate the passage 
of the feces.

Beyond the pectinate line, the simple columnar epi-
thelium of the rectal mucosa is replaced by a stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. This epithelial transformation 
zone has clinical signiﬁcance in pathology: colorectal 
adenocarcinoma  (gland-like)  originates  above  the 
transformation  zone;  epidermoid  (epidermis-like) 
carcinoma originates below the transformation zone 
(anal canal).

  At the level of the anus, the inner circular layer 
of smooth muscle thickens to form the internal anal 
sphincter. The longitudinal smooth muscle layer ex-
tends over the sphincter and attaches to the connective 
tissue. Below this zone, the mucosa consists of strati-
ﬁed squamous epithelium with a few sebaceous and 
sweat glands in the submucosa (circumanal glands 
similar to the axillary sweat glands). The external anal 
sphincter is formed by skeletal muscle and lies inside 
the levator ani muscle, also with a sphincter function.

We  discussed  in  Chapter  8,  Nervous Tissue,  that 
during  formation  of  the  neural  tube,  neural  crest 
cells migrate from the neuroepithelium along deﬁned 
pathways  to  tissues,  where  they  differentiate  into 
various cell types. 

One destination of neural crest cells is the alimen-
tary  tube,  where  they  develop  the  enteric  nervous 
system. The enteric nervous system partially controls 
and coordinates the normal movements of the ali-
mentary tube that facilitate digestion and transport 
of bowel contents. 

The large intestine, like the rest of the alimentary 
tube,  is  innervated  by  the  enteric  nervous  system 
receiving  impulses  from  extrinsic  parasympathetic 
and sympathetic nerves and from receptors within 
the large intestine. 

The transit of contents from the small intestine to 
the large intestine is intermittent and regulated at the 
ileocecal junction by a sphincter mechanism: When 
the  sphincter  relaxes,  ileal  contractions  propel  the 
contents into the large intestine.

Segmental contractions in an orad-to-aborad di-
rection move the contents over short distances. The 
material changes from a liquid to a semisolid state 
when it reaches the descending and sigmoid colon. 
The rectum is usually empty. 

Contraction of the inner anal sphincter closes the 
anal canal. Defecation occurs when the sphincter re-

Anal canal and anus

The rectum is divided into of two parts: 
  (1) The upper part (rectum proper) consists of 
a mucosa with tubular glands of Lieberkühn, 
similar to the colon. Single lymphoid follicles can 
be found in the mucosa and extending to the 
submucosa. 
  (2) In the lower part, the anal canal displays 8 
to 10 longitudinal permanent rectal/anal 
columns. Between the base of the columns are 
mucosal folds forming the anal valves. Small 
pockets or sinuses are behind the valves. The 
valves form an irregular line, the pectinate line.  
When a tear originates at the anal valve and 
extends distally, a painful anal fissure is 
produced. Lubricating anal mucous glands open 
into each sinus. At the level of the pectinate line, 
the mucosa is lined by a stratified squamous 
epithelium (low keratinized).
  The anus is covered by perianal skin, lined by a 
highly keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

Defects of neural crest cell migration and 

development: Hirschsprung's disease

Hirschsprung's disease (congenital aganglionic 
megacolon) is caused by mutations of the RET 
(receptor tyrosine kinase) gene that prevents the 
migration and differentiation of neural crest cells into 
neurons of the enteric nervous system.
   Aganglionosis may result from defects in the 
migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival of 
the neural crest cell precursor population.

laxes as part of the rectosphincteric reﬂex stimulated 
by distention of the rectum.

Delayed transit through the colon leads to severe 
constipation. An abnormal form of constipation is 
seen in Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital megaco-
lon) caused by the absence of the enteric nervous sys-
tem in a segment of the distal colon (Figure 16-24). 
This condition, called aganglionosis, results from 
an arrest in the migration of cells from the neural 
crest, the precursors of the intramural ganglion cells 
of  the  plexuses  of  Meissner  and  Auerbach.  Agan-
glionosis  is  caused  by  mutations  of  the  RET  gene 
encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase. 

RET signaling is required for:
1. The formation of Peyer’s patches (see Box 16-A).
2. The migration of neural crest cells into the distal 

portions of the large intestine.

3. The  differentiation  of  neural  crest  cells  into 

neurons of the enteric nervous system.

The permanently contracted aganglionic segment 
does not allow the entry of the contents. An increase 
in muscular tone in the orad segment results in its di-
lation, thus generating a megacolon or megarectum. 
This condition is apparent shortly after birth when 
the abdomen of the infant becomes distended and 
little meconium is eliminated. 

The  diagnosis  is  conﬁrmed  by  a  biopsy  of  the 
mucosa and submucosa of the rectum showing  thick 
and irregular nerve bundles, abundant acetylcholin-
esterase  detected  by  immunohistochemistry  and  a 
lack of ganglion cells. 

Surgical removal of the affected colon segment is 
the  treatment  of  choice  but  intestinal  dysfunction 
may persist after surgery.

Pathology: Colorectal tumorigenesis
Colorectal tumors develop from a polyp, a tumoral 

mass that protrudes into the lumen of the intestine. 
Some  polyps  are  non-neoplastic  and  are  relatively 
common in persons 60 years and older. Polyps can 
be present in large number (100 or more) in  familial 
polyposis syndromes such as familial adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP) and the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.  
FAP is determined by autosomal dominant mu-
tations,  in  particular  in  the  APC  (adenomatous 
polyposis coli) gene. FAP patients develop multiple 
polyps in the colon in their teenage years, increase in 
number with age and later become cancerous. 

Mutations in the APC gene have been detected in 
85% of colon tumors, indicating that, as with the 
retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, the inherited gene is also 
important in the development of the sporadic form 
of the cancer.  

The APC gene encodes APC protein with bind-
ing afﬁnity to (cid:96)-catenin, a molecule associated with 
a catenin complex  linked to E-cadherin (discussed 
in Chapter 1, Epithelium) and also a transcriptional 
coactivator.  

Mutations in the APC gene have also been found 
in people with desmoid tumors, a benign tumor of 
the  connective  tissue.  Mutations  in  the  APC  gene 
are also observed in Turcot syndrome, characterized 
by an association of colorectal cancer with medul-
loblastoma, a brain tumor. The APC gene is located 
on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5.

When(cid:3)(cid:96)-catenin is not part of the catenin(cid:3)complex:  
1. Free cytoplasmic (cid:96)-catenin can be phosphory-
lated by glycogen synthase kinase 3(cid:96) (GSK3(cid:96)) (coas-
sembled with proteins APC, axin and casein kinase 
I(cid:95), CKI(cid:95)) and targeted for proteasomal degradation 
(Figure 16-25). 

Phosphorylated (cid:96)-catenin is recognized by a ubiq-
uitin ligase complex that catalyzes the attachment of 
polyubiquitin  chains  to  phosphorylated  (cid:96)-catenin.

Cadherins, (cid:96)-catenin, and tumorigenesis

Cadherins are transmembrane proteins that establish 
cell-to-cell contacts, link to F-actin, and participate in 
cell signaling (see Chapter 1, Epithelium).
  The intracellular domain of cadherin is associated 
with a large protein complex that includes (cid:96)-catenin.     
Several signaling pathways determine the 
dissociation of (cid:96)-catenin from the cell adhesion 
complex and to regulate nuclear transcription.
  The kinase GSK3(cid:96)(cid:3)phosphorylates APC-bound 
(cid:96)-catenin and targets its destruction by the 26S 
proteasome. 
  Inactivating mutations in APC or (cid:96)-catenin genes 
affect the degradation of (cid:96)-catenin. Consequently, 
excess (cid:96)-catenin, bound to TCF and LEF, induces 
the expression of proteins leading to tumorigenesis.

Polyubiquitin  conjugates  of  (cid:96)-catenin  are  rapidly 
degraded by the 26S proteasome. 

2.  Alternatively,  free  cytoplasmic  (cid:96)-catenin  can 
enter  the  nucleus  and  interact  with  the  transcrip-
tion factors TCF (T cell factor) and LEF (lymphoid 
enhancer factor) to stimulates transcription of target 
genes (see Figure 16-25). 

A  mutation  in  the  APC  gene  results  in  a  trun-
cated nonfunctional protein unable to interact with 
(cid:96)-catenin and initiate its disposal when is no longer 
needed.  Essentially,  APC  behaves  as  a  tumor  sup-
pressor gene.

The APC  gene is also a major regulator of the Wnt 
pathway, a signaling  system expressed during early 
development and embryogenesis (see Chapter 3, Cell 
Signaling). Wnt proteins can inactivate GSK3(cid:96), pre-
vent the phosphorylation of (cid:96)-catenin, and abrogate 
its destruction by the 26S proteasome. Consequently, 
an excess of (cid:96)-catenin translocates to the cell nucleus 
to affect gene transcription.

A  defective  (cid:96)-catenin  pathway  can  overexpress 
the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor 
(MITF). We discussed in Chapter 11, Integumentary 

System, the signiﬁcance of MITF in the survival and 
proliferation of  melanoma cells.  

Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC; 
Lynch syndrome) is an inherited form of colorectal 
cancer  caused  by  mutations    in  DNA  mismatch 
repair, MMR, genes, involved in the repair of DNA 
defects. 

Mutation  analysis  of  MMR  genes  (including 
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM genes) 
by microsatellite instability (MIS) screening testing 
using  colon  tumor  tissue  removed  by  colonoscopy 
or  surgery,  is  carried  out  when  there  is  evidence 
of a DNA repair defect in a tumor. Note that not 
all  individuals  who  carry  these  mutations  develop 
cancerous tumors. 

DNA repair defects increase the frequency of so-
matic mutations leading to malignant transformation. 
HNPCC is an example of a cancer syndrome caused 
by mutations in DNA repair proteins. 

Patients with the HNPCC syndrome do not show 
the very large number of colon polyps typical of the 
familial polyposis syndrome, but a small number of 
polyps occur frequently among gene carriers.   

Essential concepts

Lower Digestive Segment

• Small intestine. The main functions of the 
small intestine are to continue in the duo-
denum the digestive process initiated in the 
stomach, and to absorb digested food after 
enzymatic breakdown.
   The intestinal wall is constructed to perform 
absorptive functions and propel the  intestinal 
contents to the next segment of the small 
intestine. 
   There are four degrees of folding to amplify 
the absorptive intestinal surface: 
  (1) The plicae circulares, permanent evagina-
tions or folds of the mucosa and part of the 
submucosa.
  (2) The intestinal villi, ﬁnger-like evaginations 
of the mucosa only; a typical feature of the 
small intestine.
  (3) The glands or crypts of Lieberkühn, invag-
inations of the mucosa between adjacent villi, 
extending down to the muscularis mucosae.
  (4) Microvilli, apical differentiation of the 
enterocyte, the absorptive cell of the small 
intestine.
  The muscularis mucosae is a component of 
the mucosa. Together with the lining epithe-
lium of the villi and intestinal glands and the 
connective tissue lamina propria, is the bound-
ary between the mucosa and submucosa. 
  The muscularis consists of inner circular 
smooth muscle ﬁbers and outer longitudinal 
smooth muscle ﬁbers. It is responsible for 
mixing the intestinal contents and for peristaltic 
movements from a proximal (orad) to a distal 
(aborad) direction. 

  Loose connective tissue adjacent to the mus-
cularis is covered by the peritoneum.

• The peritoneum is a serous membrane con-
sisting of a connective tissue stroma (contain-
ing elastic ﬁbers, blood and lymphatic vessels, 
and nerves) lined  by mesothelial cells. The 
parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall 
and reﬂects to cover the abdominal viscera as 
the visceral peritoneum. 
  The mesentery is a layer of loose connective 
tissue (areolar connective tissue) covered with 
peritoneum. 
  The mesentery attaches the abdominal 
viscera to the posterior abdominal wall and 
it serves as a conduit of blood and lymphatic 
vessels and nerves to these organs. The blood 
vessels are components of the subserosal 
plexus. During digestion, the lymphatic vessels 
emerging from the walls of the small intestine 
carry a ﬂuid rich in absorbed fat emulsion, or 
chyle. 
  The esophagus lacks a serosa. The duode-
num and ascending and descending colon at-
tach to the abdominal cavity by the adventitia, 
loose connective tissue continuous with the 
surrounding stroma of the wall. 
  The omenta and visceral ligaments have a 
structure similar to the mesentery. The greater 
omentum has considerable adipose tissue.

• The intestinal wall is supplied by a rich blood, 
lymphatic, and nerve supply. The nerve supply 
derives from the submucosal plexus of Meiss-

ner and myenteric plexus of Auerbach, com-
ponents of the autonomic nervous system.
  A central lymphatic vessel (lacteal) is present 
in the lamina propria of the intestinal villus. 
A capillary villus plexus supplies the intestinal 
villus; a pericryptal capillary plexus supplies 
the glands of Lieberkühn. 

• The three major sequential segments of the 
small intestine are:
  (1) The duodenum.
  (2) The jejunum.
  (3) The ileum.

Remember the following:
  • The duodenum has Brunner’s glands in 
the submucosa, and the villi are broad and 
short (leaﬂike). 
  • The jejunum has long villi (ﬁnger-like), 
each with a prominent lacteal. Brunner’s 
glands are not present in the submucosa. 
  • The ileum has shorter ﬁnger-like villi. A 
relevant feature are the Peyer’s patches. 
  • Paneth cells are found at the base of the 
glands of Lieberkühn in the jejunum and 
ileum.

• The intestinal villus and glands of Lieberkühn 
are lined by a simple columnar epithelium 
consisting of:
  (1) Absorptive enterocytes, columnar cells 
with apical microvilli, the brush border.
  (2) Goblet cells, a mucus-secreting cell 
forming a double layer protective gel coat to

  (3) Paneth cells (reviewed below).
  (4) Enteroendocrine cells, produce gastrin, 
secretin, and cholecystokinin. The distribution 
and function of enteroendocrine cells are sum-
marized in Essential Concepts in Chapter 15, 
Upper Digestive Segment.
  (5) Intestinal stem cell (ISCs) reside in a 
niche at the base of the crypts, close to Paneth 
cells.
  Adult ISCs, identiﬁed by the protein marker 
Lgr5 (for leucine-rich repeat-containing G 
protein coupled receptor 5), can differentiate 
into the secretory goblet cells, Paneth cells, 
and enteroendocrine cells and the absorptive 
enterocytes, lining the epithelium of the small 
intestine. 
  ISCs are multipotent and capable of long-
term self-renewal as long as they remain at the 
crypt niche. 
 Following injury, cells committed to the intes-
tinal secretory pathway and expressing Delta-
like 1 (DLL1), a ligand of the Notch family of 
proteins, can return to the stem cell compart-
ment and revert into multipotent ISCs. 

  The surface of the epithelium is coated by 
the glycocalyx, consisting of glycoproteins 
representing enzymes involved in the digestive 
process: absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, 
and lipids.

• Enterocytes are involved in the absorption 
of proteins, carbohydrate, lipids, cholesterol, 
calcium, and other substances. 
   Absorption of proteins and carbohy-
drates: Pancreatic proteolytic enzymes break 
down proteins into peptides and amino acids. 
Once absorbed, peptides are broken down by 
cytoplasmic peptidases into amino acids. 
   Salivary and pancreatic amylase, and 
enzymes (oligosaccharidases) present in the 
plasma membrane of the intestinal villi convert 
sugars into monosaccharides (galactose and 
glucose), which are transported inside the 
enterocyte by an Na+-dependent carrier sys-
tem, the sugar glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1) 
driven by a Na+,K+-ATPase. 

  Absorption of lipids. Lipids are emulsi-
ﬁed in the intestinal lumen by bile salts and 
pancreatic lipase to form micelles (fatty acids 
and monoglycerides). Micelles diffuse into 
the cytoplasm of the enterocyte bound to 
fatty acid–binding protein, and esteriﬁed into 
triglycerides in the smooth endoplasmic reticu-
lum. Tryglycerides are transported to the Golgi 
apparatus and converted into chylomicrons 
(apoprotein-lipid complex). Chylomicrons are 
released into the enterocyte intercellular space 
and into the central lacteal.

  Absorption of cholesterol. Similar to the 
absorption of dietary lipids, cholesterol is solu-

bilized in the intestinal lumen into micelles 
by bile acids to facilitate micellar movement 
through the diffusion barrier of the entero-
cytes. 
  Two cholesterol pathways are important to 
remember: the uptake and export pathways.
  (1) The NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like-1) 
protein, located also at the apical domain, 
facilitates the uptake of cholesterol that is 
esteriﬁed by ACAT2 (Acyl CoA cholesterol 
acyltransfertase isoform 2). Esteriﬁed choles-
terol  becomes part of chylomicron particles, 
assembled in the smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum.   
  (2) The ABCG5/ABCG8 (ATP-binding 
cassette, ABC) heterodimeric transporters 
at the apical domain of enterocytes export 
absorbed cholesterol back into the intesti-
nal lumen. This step facilitates the removal 
of cholesterol from the body. Mutations in 
ABCG5 or ABCG8 genes cause sitosterol-
emia, an autosomal recessive disorder in 
which cholesterol accumulates in the circula-
tion leading to premature cardiovascular 
disease.
   
  Malabsorption syndromes can be caused 
by abnormal digestion of fats and proteins 
by pancreatic diseases (pancreatitis or cystic 
ﬁbrosis), or lack of solubilization of fats by 
defective bile secretion (hepatic disease or 
obstruction of bile ﬂow to the duodenum).

Essential concepts

Enzymatic abnormalities in the brush border 
hamper protein and carbohydrate (lactose 
intolerance) absorption.  An abnormal trans-
port mechanism across enterocytes can cause 
malabsorption syndromes. 
   Anemia can occur when the intrinsic fac-
tor–vitamin B12 complex, iron, and other 
cofactors fail to be absorbed. Functional 
alterations of the musculoskeletal system 
occur when proteins, calcium, and vitamin D 
are not absorbed.
 
• The small intestine is protected from patho-
gens by:
  (1) An intestinal tight junction barrier link-
ing adjacent enterocytes. Claudin and occludin 
are two transmembrane proteins of tight 
junctions that regulate solute permeability of 
the transcellular pathway. A defect of the tight 
junction barrier can allow bacterial products or 
dietary antigens to cross the epithelium and 
enter the lamina propria. 

  (2)  Peyer’s patches participate in the cel-
lular surveillance and processing of antigens. 
Peyer’s patches have the ability to transport 
luminal antigens and microorganisms and re-
spond to them by inducing immune tolerance 
or a systemic immune defense response. An 
example of the functional deﬁciency of Peyer’s 
patches is Crohn’s disease, an inﬂammatory 
bowel disease characterized by chronic or 
relapsing inﬂammation.
  Peyer’s patches display three main compo-
nents: 
  • The follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), 
consisting of M cells and enterocytes.
  • Lymphoid follicles, each showing a germinal 
center and a subepithelial dome area. 
  • The interfollicular area, with blood vessels 
and efferent lymphatic vessels. 
   The main components of the FAE are M 
cells and dendritic cells. 
  M cells are specialized enterocytes that have 
replaced the brush border by short micro-
folds (hence the name M cell) and takes up 
antigens. M cells form intraepithelial pockets, 
where a subpopulation of intraepithelial B cells 
resides and express IgA receptors allowing 
the capture and phagocytosis of IgA-bound 
bacteria.
  Dendritic cell extend cytoplasmic processes 
between tight junctions linking enterocytes to 
monitor antigens.

  (3) The neutralization of antigens by 
polymeric IgA, produced by plasma cells in 
the lamina propria of the intestinal villus and 
transported to the intestinal lumen across the 
enterocyte by a mechanism called transcytosis.
  • Polymeric IgA binds to a speciﬁc receptor, 
called the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor 
(pIgR), available on the basal surfaces of the 
enterocytes. 
  • The pIgR has an attached secretory com-
ponent. The polymeric IgA–pIgR–secretory 
component complex is internalized and trans-
ported across the cell to the apical surface of 
the epithelial cell (transcytosis). 
  • At the apical surface, the complex is 

cleaved enzymatically and the polymeric IgA-
secretory component complex is released into 
the intestinal lumen as secreted IgA (SIgA). 
  • IgA attaches to bacteria and soluble anti-
gens, preventing a direct damaging effect to 
intestinal cells and penetration into the lamina 
propria.
  Plasma cells are induced to produce poly-
meric IgA when Toll-like receptor (TLR) on 
enterocytes is activated by microbiota. 
  • Enterocytes secrete B cell-activating factor 
(BAF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand 
(APRIL). 
  • In the lamina propria, BAF and APRIL 
induce the differentiation of B cells into IgA-
producing plasma cells..  
  • In addition, the microbiota instructs entero-
cytes through thymic stromal lymphoprotein 
(TSLP) to engage dendritic cells in the lamina 
propria to secrete BAF and APRIL and induce 
the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells.

  (4) The inactivation of microbial pathogens 
by antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), products of 
Paneth cells and enterocytes retained in the 
intestinal mucus blanket produced by goblet 
cells. Therefore, the mucus layer protects the 
intestinal mucosa by two mechanisms:
  • By creating a barrier that limits direct ac-
cess of luminal bacteria to the epithelium.
  • By concentrating AMPs near the entero-
cyte surface. AMPs are virtually absent from 
the luminal content.   
  Most AMPs inactivate or kill bacteria directly 
by enzymatic degradation of the bacterial wall 
or by disrupting the bacterial inner mem-
brane. 
  Paneth cells produce several AMPs:
  (1) Defensins ((cid:95)-defensin 5 [DEFA5] and  
(cid:95)-defensin 6 [DEFA6] in humans)
  (2) C-type lectins, including regenerating 
islet-derived protein 3(cid:97) (REG3(cid:97)), also known 
as hepatointestinal protein/pancreatitis-asso-
ciated protein (HIP/PAP). 
  (3) Lysozyme and phospholipase A2 
(PLA2).
  (4) Angiogenin 4 (ANG4).
  The expression and function of AMPs is 
highly regulated by the presence or absence 
of the microbiota.
  In the presence of microorganisms:
  • TLR on enterocytes controls the expression 
of  REG3(cid:97)/HIP/PAP through the TLR-signaling 
adaptor myeloid-differentiation primary 
response protein 88 (MYD88). 
 • Cytoplasmic NOD2 (nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain 2), expressed by 
Paneth cells, controls the expression of 
(cid:95)-defensins when it binds to an internalized  
peptidoglycan peptide fragment (muramyl 
dipeptide, MDP) and activates the transcrip-
tion factor NF-(cid:103)B. 
  • NOD2 can also limit the development of 
a CD4+ T cell-initiated immune response, 
thus contributing to immunogenic tolerance 
toward the microbiota.

• A defect in the protective system accounts 
for inﬂammatory bowel diseases, including 
ulcerative colitis (large intestine) and Crohn’s 

  
disease (involving the terminal ileum but also 
observed in the large intestine).

• The large intestine consists of:
  (1) The cecum and associated appendix.
  (2) The ascending, transverse, and de-
scending colon.
  (3) The sigmoid colon.
  (4) The rectum.
  (5) The anus.
   Plicae circulares and intestinal villi are not 
observed beyond the ileocecal valve. 
  The mucosa of the large intestine is lined 
by a simple columnar epithelium formed by 
enterocytes and abundant goblet cells. 
  Enterocytes have short apical microvilli. A 
major function of enterocytes in the large 
intestine is the transport of ions and water. 
Secretory products of goblet cells lubricate the 
mucosal surface.
   Glands of Lieberkühn are observed. They 
contain enteroendocrine cells and stem cells. 
Paneth cells are not observed (they may be 
present in the cecum).
   Three characteristic features of the large 
intestine are:
  (1) The taeniae coli, formed by fused 
bundles of the outer smooth muscle layer. 
  (2) The haustra, periodic saccular structures 
formed by the contraction of the taeniae coli 
and the inner circular smooth muscle layer.
  (3) The appendix epiploica, aggregates of 
adipose tissue covered by the serosa (perito-
neum).

  The appendix is a diverticulum of the cecum. 
Prominent lymphoid follicles or nodules are 
seen in the mucosa and submucosa. M cells 
are not present.

   The rectum, the terminal portion of the 
large intestine and a continuation of the 
sigmoid colon, consists of two regions: 
  (1) The upper region, or rectum proper.
  (2) The lower region, or anal canal, which 
extends from the anorectal junction to the 
anus. 
  The mucosa of the rectum displays long 
glands of Lieberkühn; glands disappear at the 
level of the anal canal. 
  Anal columns are present in the anal canal. 
The anal columns are connected at their 
base by valves, corresponding to transverse 
folds of the mucosa.  Small pockets, called 
anal sinuses, or crypts, are found behind the 
valves. Mucous glandular crypts behind the 
valves secrete lubricating mucus. 
  A tear originating at the anal valves and 
extending distally produces painful anal 
ﬁssures. 
  The base of the anal columns forms the 
pectinate line. Beyond the pectinate line, 
the simple columnar epithelium of the rectal 
mucosa is replaced by a stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium (epithelial transformation zone), 
and the inner circular layer of smooth muscle 
thickens to form the internal anal sphincter. 
  Beyond this region, the anal mucosa is lined 
by a keratinizing stratiﬁed squamous epithe-
lium and the submucosa contains sebaceous

and sweat glands (circumanal glands). The 
external anal sphincter, formed by skeletal 
muscle, is present.

• Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital megaco-
lon) is caused by a defect in the migration and 
differentiation of neural crest cells, which give 
rise to neurons of the enteric nervous system. 
  This condition, called aganglionosis, is caused 
by mutations of the RET gene encoding a 
receptor tyrosine kinase. RET signaling is 
required for the migration of neural crest cells 
into the distal portions of the large intes-
tine and their differentiation into intramural 
ganglion cells of the plexuses of Meissner and 
Auerbach of the enteric nervous system.
  Delayed transit through the colon leads to 
severe constipation resulting from the absence 
of the enteric nervous system in a segment of 
the distal colon. 
  The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by a biopsy of 
the mucosa and submucosa of the rectum 
showing  thick and irregular nerve bundles, 
abundant acetylcholinesterase detected by 
immunohistochemistry and a lack of ganglion 
cells. 

  Surgical removal of the affected colon seg-
ment is the treatment of choice but intestinal 
dysfunction may persist after surgery.
 • Colorectal tumors develop from a polyp.
Some polyps are non-neoplastic and are rela-
tively common in persons 60 years and older. 
Polyps can be present in large number (100 
or more) in  familial polyposis syndromes such 
as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 
the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.   
  FAP is determined by autosomal dominant 
mutations, in particular in the APC (adenoma-
tous polyposis coli) gene. FAP patients develop 
multiple polyps in the colon in their teenage 
years, increase in number with age and later 
become cancerous. 
  The APC gene encodes APC protein with 
binding afﬁnity to (cid:96)-catenin, a molecule 
associated with a catenin complex  linked to E-
cadherin and also a transcriptional coactivator.    
  When (cid:96)-catenin is not part of the catenin 
complex:  
  (1) Free cytoplasmic (cid:96)-catenin can be 
phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 
3(cid:96)(cid:3)(GSK3(cid:96)) (coassembled with proteins APC, 

axin and casein kinase I(cid:95), CKI(cid:95)) and targeted 
for proteasomal degradation.  
  (2) Alternatively, free cytoplasmic (cid:96)-catenin 
can enter the nucleus and interact with the 
transcription factors TCF (T cell factor) and 
LEF (lymphoid enhancer factor) to stimulates 
transcription of target genes. 
  (3) A mutation in the APC gene results in 
a truncated nonfunctional protein unable to 
interact with(cid:3)(cid:96)-catenin and initiate its disposal 
when is no longer needed. 
  (4) An excess of (cid:96)-catenin translocates to 
the cell nucleus to affect gene transcription 
and trigger tumorigenesis.

  Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer 
(HNPCC; Lynch syndrome) is an inherited 
form of colorectal cancer caused by muta-
tions in DNA mismatch repair, MMR, genes, 
involved in the repair of DNA defects. 
  Mutation analysis of MMR genes (including 
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM 
genes) by microsatellite instability (MIS) 
screening testing using colon tumor tissue, is 
carried out when there is evidence of a DNA 
repair defect in a tumor.

17. Digestive Glands

Digestive glands have lubricative, protective, digestive, and absorptive functions mediated by their secretory 
products. The three main digestive glands are: (1) The major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sub-
lingual glands), associated with the oral cavity through independent excretory ducts. (2) The exocrine pancreas, 
that secretes its alkaline aqueous and enzymatic product into the duodenum. (3) The liver, an endocrine and 
exocrine gland with extensive access to the blood circulation. It releases bile into the duodenum. In this chapter, 
the structure and function of salivary glands, exocrine pancreas, and liver are described. Molecular aspects of 
the parotid gland, pancreas, and liver are presented to emphasize the role of speciﬁc structures and cell types 
in frequent medical and pathologic conditions.
 
General structure of a salivary gland
We  start  the  discussion  by  reviewing  the  general 
organization  and  function  of  a  salivary  gland,  in 
particular  its  branching  ducts  (see  Box  17-A).  An 
initial discussion concerning the general features of a 
compound or branched gland is included in Chapter 
2, Epithelial Glands.

1.  An intercalated duct, lined by low squamous-
to-cuboidal epithelium, is the smallest duct connect-
ing an acinus to a striated duct. Its diameter is smaller 
than an acinus. Intercalated ducts are the longest in 
the parotid gland. 

A salivary gland is surrounded by a connective tis-
sue capsule. Partitions or septa extend from the cap-
sule into the gland creating lobes as large divisions. 
Interlobar septa continue to branch as interlobular 
septa, subdividing lobes into several small  lobules. 
The amount of connective tissue decreases from the 
interlobar septa to the interlobular septa. It is greatly 
reduced within each lobule. 

Septa provide appropriate conduits for the main 
branches of a duct to extend from the interior of a 
gland to its exterior and for vessels and nerves to reach 
the interior of a gland. 

Figures  17-1  and  17-2  summarize  the  pathway 
followed by a secretory product of a salivary gland 
to reach the exterior of a gland.

The basic histologic features of a salivary gland are 
the secretory units, the acini, and the excretory ducts. 
We start with the excretory ducts inside a lobule (see 
Figure 17-1):  

 Box 17-A | Classiﬁcation of exocrine glands: Highlights to remember

•  Depending on the structure of the excretory duct, glands can be divided 
into simple (unbranched duct) and branched or compound (branched duct).
•   According to the structure of the secretory units, glands can be classiﬁed 
as tubular or alveolar (acinar).
•   Considering the secretory product, glands are serous when they secrete a 
watery ﬂuid, or mucous when the secretion is thick and rich in glycoproteins.
•   Taking into account the secretory mechanism, glands can be merocrine 
when the product is released by exocytosis (for example, the pancreas). In 
holocrine glands, the whole cell is the secretory product (for example, the 
sebaceous glands of the skin). An apocrine gland releases its product together 
with a small amount of the apical cytoplasm of the secretory cell (for example, 
the mammary gland).

2. A striated duct is lined by cuboidal-to-columnar 
epithelial  cells  with  basal  infoldings  containing 
numerous mitochondria. It is well developed in the 
submandibular gland. The intercalated and striated 
ducts are modestly developed in the sublingual gland. 
3. A number of striated ducts leave the lobule to 
connect with an interlobular duct. An interlobular 
duct  is  initially  lined  by  cuboidal-to-columnar 
epithelium and becomes pseudostratiﬁed columnar. 
Interlobular ducts are located in interlobular septa. 
4.  Several  interlobular  ducts  converge  to  form  a 
lobar duct present in interlobar septa. Lobar ducts 
are lined by stratiﬁed columnar epithelium, one of 
the few sites in the body with this type of epithelium.
5. Several lobar ducts, lined by stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium, join the main duct that drains the entire 
gland near the opening into the oral cavity.   

The  parotid,  submandibular  (or  submaxillary), 
and  sublingual  glands  are  classiﬁed  as  branched 
tubuloalveolar glands.  

Saliva
Saliva,  amounting  to  a  half-liter  daily,  contains 
proteins,  glycoproteins  (mucus),  ions,  water,  and 
polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) attached to  a 
secretory component (SIgA) (Figure 17-3). 

The submandibular gland  produces about 70% 
of  the  saliva. The  parotid  gland  contributes  25% 
and secretes an amylase-rich saliva. The production 
of saliva is under the control of the autonomic ner-
vous system. Upon stimulation, the parasympathetic 
system induces the secretion of a water-rich saliva; 
the  sympathetic  system  stimulates  the  release  of  a 
protein-rich saliva. 

The mucus and water in saliva lubricate the mucosa 
of  the  tongue,  cheeks,  and  lips  during  speech  and 

529

Figure 17-1. Review of the general histologic organization of a compound gland

An intercalated duct of a parotid gland interconnects 
several acini.  The lining epithelium is low simple cuboidal. 
The diameter of the intercalated duct is smaller than the 
acini but the lumen of the duct is wider. A striated duct is not 
observed in this histology image.

swallowing, dissolve food for the function of the taste 
buds, and moisten food for easy swallowing.

 The protective function of the saliva depends on 

the antibacterial function of three constituents: 

1. Lysozyme, which attacks the walls of bacteria.
2. Lactoferrin, which chelates iron necessary for 

bacterial growth.

3. SIgA, which neutralizes bacteria and viruses. 
The digestive function of saliva relies on:
1. Amylase (ptyalin), which initiates the digestion 

of  carbohydrates (starch) in the oral cavity.

2. Lingual lipase, which participates in the hydro-

lysis of dietary lipids.

Parotid gland
The parotid gland is the largest salivary gland. It is 
a branched tubuloalveolar gland surrounded by a 
connective  tissue  capsule  with  septa,  representing 
a component of the stroma, the supporting tissue 
of the gland. Adipose cells are frequently found in 
the stroma. 

Septa divide the gland into lobes and  lobules (see 

Figure  17-1).  Septa  also  provide  support  to  blood 
vessels, lymphatics, and nerves gaining access to the 
acini, the main components of the parenchyma, the 
functional constituent of the gland. 

Acini are surrounded by reticular connective tissue, 
a rich capillary network, plasma cells, and lympho-
cytes. Acini consist mainly of serous secretory cells 
and, therefore, are classiﬁed as serous acini.

Each serous acinus is lined by pyramidal cells with 
a basally located nucleus. Similar to all protein-pro-
ducing cells, a prominent rough endoplasmic reticu-
lum system occupies the cell basal region. Secretory 
granules are visible in the apical region (Figure 17-4). 
The  lumen  of  the  acinus  collects  the  secretory 
products, which are transported by long intercalated 
ducts to the less abundant striated ducts (see Figure 
17-1 and Figure 17-5). 

The secretory product of the serous acini is modi-
ﬁed by the secretion of the striated duct and then 
transported by interlobular ducts and lobar ducts to 
the oral cavity by a main excretory duct (Stensen’s 
duct).

Plasma cells are abundant in the connective tissue surrounding the

in the plasma membrane of acinar, intercalated, and striated epithelial 
cells. After transcytosis, pIgA is released into the acinar lumen as 
proteolytic-resistant secretory IgA (SigA).

Mucous acinus

Acini in salivary glands contain serous cells and 
mucous cells. The parotid gland consists solely of 
serous acini, whereas the submandibular and 
sublingual glands contain both cell types. In the 
submandibular gland, serous cells predominate. In the 
sublingual gland, mucous cells are more abundant. 
    Serous and mucous cells can coexist in the same 
acinus: The serous cells are located at the fundus of 
the acinus, forming a crescent-shaped structure 
(called the serous demilune) embracing the mucous 
cells located closer to the opening of the acinus into 
the intercalated duct. 
    In mixed acini, extensions of the acinar lumen 
project deeply between serous cells forming 
intercellular secretory canaliculi for the transport of 
serous secretions. 
    The outer surface of the acinus is surrounded by 
contractile myoepithelial cells in a basket-like fashion. 
Both myoepithelial cells and the acinus are enclosed 
by a basal lamina.

        The secretion of the acinus 
enters the intercalated duct, lined by

Myoepithelial cells are associated 
with acini and intercalated ducts.  
   Intercalated ducts are longest in 
the parotid gland. Several 
intercalated ducts join to form the 
striated duct. Intercalated ducts 
and striated ducts are found 
within a lobule.

        The next segment is the striated 
duct, lined by cuboidal to columnar cells 
with basal striations created by vertically 
aligned mitochondria within deep 
infoldings of the basal plasma membrane. 
This epithelium is involved in the 
transport of water and ions. Striated 
ducts are well developed in the 
submandibular and parotid glands.

        Following the striated duct is the interlobular duct, lined initially by 
3
columnar epithelium and then by a pseudostratified columnar epithelium. 
Interlobular ducts are located in interlobular septa. 
    Several interlobular ducts drain into a wider lobar duct located in the 
interlobar septum. Connective tissue, vessels, and nerves are seen in septa.

In the exocrine pancreas, only serous acini are present. 
    A unique feature of the pancreatic acinus is the presence 
of squamous-to-cuboidal epithelial centroacinar cells. 
Squamous centroacinar cells are inserted on one side of the 
acinar lumen. Centroacinar cells and striated ductal cells 
secrete HCO3– , Na+, and water. The free apical domain of 
the serous acinar discharges zymogen granules between 
gaps of the centroacinar cell layer.  
    Striated ducts and myoepithelial cells are not present 
in the exocrine pancreas.

Figure 17-3. Functional aspects of a salivary gland

        Acinar cells pump Na+ and Cl– actively into the acinar 
1
lumen and allow free passage of water from the surrounding 
blood capillaries. This results in the formation of isotonic primary 
saliva. Mucous cells release mucins. Serous cells secrete 
several proteins, including proline-rich proteins (which are 
modified in the striated duct by the enzyme kallikrein), enzymes 
(amylases, peroxidases, lysozyme), lactoferrin, cystatins 
(cysteine-rich proteins) and histatins (histidine-rich proteins).

       In the striated duct, Na+ and Cl– are reabsorbed and the saliva 
2
becomes hypotonic. Kallikrein, a serine protease secreted by epithelial cells 
of the striated duct, processes the proline-rich proteins and cystatins in the 
saliva. In addition, plasma cells secrete polymeric immunoglobulin A 
(pIgA), which reaches the lumen of the acinus and striated duct by 
transcytosis. The final saliva contains a complex of proteins with antimicrobial 
activity and with digestive function (amylase). Bicarbonate, the primary 
buffering agent of the saliva, is produced in the striated duct.

In the mouth, proteins in the saliva form protective films on the teeth called

moisture, and regulate the adherence and activity of bacteria and yeast in the oral 
cavity. Histatin inhibits the growth of Candida albicans. Dysfunction of the salivary 
glands causes tooth decay, yeast infections, and inflammation of the oral mucosa. 

 
Pathology: Mumps, rabies, and tumors 
In addition to its role in the production of saliva, the 
parotid gland is the primary target of the rabies and 
mumps  virus  transmitted  in  saliva  containing  the 
virus. The mumps virus causes transient swelling of 
the parotid gland and confers immunity. 

Two complications of mumps are viral orchitis  and 
meningitis. Bilateral orchitis caused by the mumps 
virus can result in sterility. 

The  parotid  gland  is  the  most  frequent  site  for 
slow-growing  benign  salivary  gland  mixed  tumor 
(pleomorphic adenoma). It consists of myxochon-
droid zones with ductal epithelial and mesenchyme-
like myoepithelial cells. Its surgical removal is compli-
cated by the need to protect the facial nerve running 
through  the  parotid  gland.  Enucleation  of  mixed 
tumors results in a multifocal high recurrence rate.
Warthin tumor (papilloma cystoadenoma lympho-
matosum), the second most common benign salivary 
gland tumor, occurs in the parotid gland with a high 
risk incidence in smokers. 

The tumor stroma consist of a papillary arrange-
ment of lymphoid tissue centers surrounded by squa-
mous, mucous, and sebaceous epithelial cells. This 

tumor may develop from intraparotid or periparotid 
lymph nodes. 

Submandibular (submaxillary) gland 
The submandibular gland is a branched tubuloalveo-
lar gland surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. 
Septa derived from the capsule divide the parenchyma 
of the gland into lobes and lobules.

Although both serous and mucous cells are pres-
ent  in  the  secretory  units,  the  serous  cells  are  the 
predominant component (see Figure 17-4). Mucous 
cell–containing acini are capped by serous demilunes. 
The intercalated ducts are shorter and the striated 
ducts  are  longer  than  those  in  the  parotid  gland.
Adipocytes are not frequently seen in the subman-
dibular gland. 

The  main  excretory  duct  of  the  submandibular 
gland (Wharton’s duct) opens near the frenulum of 
the tongue.

Sublingual gland
Contrasting  with  the  parotid  and  submandibular 
glands, which are surrounded by a dense connective 
tissue capsule, the sublingual gland does not have a

The parotid gland is formed by acini 
containing exclusively serous cells with a 
basal nucleus and an apical cytoplasm with 
secretory granules. Granules are rich in 
proteins, including proline-rich proteins, 
enzymes (amylase, peroxidase, and 
lysozyme), and proteins with antimicrobial 
activity (cystatins and histatins). Although 
not visible in this image, the parotid gland 
has the longest intercalated ducts.   
    Connective tissue and blood vessels (not 
seen here) surround the serous acini. 
   Myoepithelial cells can be visualized at 
the periphery of each acinus.

Submandibular glands are mixed serous 
and mucous tubuloacinar glands. Mixed 
seromucous and serous acini are readily 
found. Pure mucous acini are uncommon 
in the submandibular gland. Striated ducts 
with basal infoldings, containing mitochondria, 
are observed within the lobule together with 
intercalated ducts (not seen here).  Mucous 
cells secrete highly glycosylated  mucins rich 
in sialic acid and sulfate that lubricate hard 
tissue surfaces, forming a thin protective film 
called a pellicle.
   This film modulates the attachment of 
bacteria to oral surfaces and forms complexes 
with other proteins present in saliva.

Sublingual glands are mixed serous and 
mucous tubuloacinar glands in which mucous 
cells predominate. A few seromucous acini 
can be found. The intercalated and striated 
ducts are poorly developed in the 
sublingual gland. Mucous cells resemble 
goblet cells of the intestinal epithelium. The 
nucleus is flattened against the basal plasma 
membrane. The apical region of the mucous 
cells is occupied by mucin-filled secretory 
vesicles (unstained). The cell boundaries are 
sharp.  Mucous cells secrete highly 
glycosylated  mucins that contribute to the 
formation of the protective pellicle film.

divide the glandular parenchyma into small lobes.

 The sublingual gland is a branched  tubuloalveolar 
gland  with both serous and mucous cells (see Figure 
17-4), although most of the secretory units contain 
mucous cells. 

The  intercalated  and  striated  ducts  are  poorly 
developed. Usually each lobe has its own excretory 
duct that opens beneath the tongue. 

Exocrine pancreas
The pancreas is a combined endocrine and exocrine 
gland. The  endocrine  component  is  the  islet  of 
Langerhans and represents about 2% of the pancreas 
volume. 

The  main  function  of  the  endocrine  pancreas  is 
the regulation of glucose metabolism by hormones 
secreted into the bloodstream (see discussion of the 
islet of Langerhans in Chapter 19, Endocrine System).
The exocrine pancreas is a branched tubuloacinar 

gland organized into four anatomic components: 

1. A head, lying in the concavity of the second and 

third parts of the duodenum.

2. A neck, in contact with the portal vein.
3. A body, placed anterior to the aorta.
4. A tail, ending near the hilum of the spleen. 
The pancreas lies close to the posterior abdominal 
wall in the upper abdomen, and therefore it is pro-
tected from severe trauma. 

Blood is provided by vessels derived from the celiac

artery, the superior mesenteric artery, and the splenic 
artery. The venous drainage ﬂows into the portal ve-
nous system and the splenic vein. Efferent innervation 
is through the vagus and splanchnic nerves. 

The  pancreas  has  structural  similarities  to  the 

salivary glands: 

1. It is surrounded by connective tissue but does 

not have a capsule proper. 

2. Lobules are separated by connective tissue septa 
carrying  blood  and  lymphatic  vessels,  nerves,  and 
excretory ducts. 

The  functional  histologic  unit  of  the  exocrine 
pancreas is the acinus (Figures 17-6 to 17-8). The 
lumen of the acinus is the initiation of the secretory-
excretory duct system and contains centroacinar cells 
that are unique to the pancreas. Centroacinar cells 
are continuous with the low cuboidal epithelial lin-
ing of the intercalated duct. Centroacinar cells and 
the epithelial lining of the intercalated duct secrete 
−, Na+, and water. The secretion of HCO3− 
HCO3
is maintained by the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) that also provides Cl–.
 The  intercalated  ducts  merge  into  intralobular 
ducts. The intralobular ducts join to form the inter-
lobular ducts, which drain into the main pancreatic 
duct.

The  main  pancreatic  duct  (of Wirsung)  runs 
straight  through  the  tail  and  the  body,  collecting 
secretions  from  ductal  tributaries.  It  turns  down-
ward when it reaches the head of the pancreas and 
drains directly into the duodenum at the ampulla of 
Vater, after joining the common bile duct. A circular 

smooth muscle sphincter (of Oddi) is seen where the 
common pancreatic and bile duct cross the wall of 
the duodenum.

The  exocrine  pancreas  lacks  striated  ducts  and 
myoepithelial  cells.  Intercalated  ducts  converge 
to  form  interlobular  ducts  lined  by  a  columnar 
epithelium  with  a  few  goblet  cells  and  occasional 
enteroendocrine cells. 

Pathology: Carcinoma of the pancreas
The pancreatic duct–bile duct anatomic relationship 
is of clinical signiﬁcance in carcinoma of the pancreas
localized in the head region, because  compression of 
the bile duct causes obstructive jaundice.
    Ductal  adenocarcinoma  is  the  most  common 
primary  malignant  tumor  of  the  pancreas.  Most 
of them arise in the head of the pancreas. Tumoral 
masses  obstruct  and  dilate  the  distal  common  bile 
and  pancreatic  ducts.  Hyperplasia  and  carcinoma 
in situ of the duct epithelial lining are the precursor 
changes  of the inﬁltrating ductal adenocarcinoma. 
Activation of the oncogene K-ras and inactivation of 
tumor suppressor genes, including p53, are molecular 
characteristics of the tumor.

The  close  association  of  the  pancreas  with  large 
blood vessels, the extensive and  diffuse abdominal 
drainage  to  lymph  nodes,  and  the  frequent  spread 
of carcinoma cells to the liver via the portal vein are 
factors contributing to the ineffectiveness of surgical 
removal of  pancreatic  tumors.

Cystic tumors of the pancreas are not neoplastic.
This category includes serous cystoadenomas (with

MEN1  is  an  autosomal  dominant  hereditary 
endocrine  cancer  syndrome  characterized  primar-
ily  by  tumors  of  the  parathyroid  glands,  gastro-
enteroendocrine  cells,  and  adenohypophysis. 
This tumor type does not show activation of the K-ras 
gene or p53 gene inactivation. 

Mutations in the MEN1 (producing the tumor sup-
pressor menin), RET  (Ret protoncogene producing 
receptor tyrosine kinase), and CDKN1B (for cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor 1B, encoding the tumor 
suppressor p27) genes can cause MENs. 

You may remember that mutations of the RET gene 
causes Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital aganglionic 
megacolon).

ferentiated  (with  structural  evidences  of  endocrine 
function)  or    moderately  differentiated.  Gastrino-
mas, insulinomas, and glucagonomas are examples 
of  endocrine  tumors  showing  cytoplasmic  secre-
tory  granules. This  tumors  belong  to  the  category

a syndrome). For example, gastrinomas produce the 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, that, as you remember 
from our discussion in Chapter 15, Upper Digestive 
Segment, is characterized by multiple peptic ulcers 
caused by continuous stimulation of HCl production 
by parietal cells in the stomach.

Functions of the pancreatic acinus
The  pancreatic  acinus  is  lined  by  pyramidal  cells 
joined to each other by apical junctional complexes 
(see Figure 17-8), which prevent the reﬂux of secreted 
products from the ducts into the intercellular spaces.
 The  basal domain of an acinar pancreatic cell is as-
sociated with a basal lamina and contains the nucleus 
and a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. 
The  apical  domain  displays  numerous  zymogen 
granules (see Figure 17-8) and the Golgi apparatus. 
The concentration of  about 20 different pancreatic 
enzymes in the zymogen granules varies with  the 
dietary intake. For example, an increase in the syn-
thesis of proteases is associated with a protein-rich 
diet. A carbohydrate-rich diet results in the selective 
synthesis of amylases and a decrease in the synthesis 
of proteases. Amylase gene expression is regulated by 

insulin, an event that stresses the signiﬁcance of the
insuloacinar portal system.

The  administration  of  a  cholinergic  drug  or  of 
the  gastrointestinal  hormones  cholecystokinin  and 
secretin increases the ﬂow of pancreatic ﬂuid (about 
1.5 to 3.0 L/day). 

The  polypeptide  hormone  cholecystokinin, 
produced in enteroendocrine cells of the duodenal 
mucosa,  binds  to  speciﬁc  receptors  of  acinar  cells 
and stimulates the release of zymogen (Figure 17-9). 
Secretin  is released when acid chyme enters the 
duodenum. Secretin is produced in the duodenum, 
binds  to  receptors  on  the  surface  of  centroacinar 
cells and  intercalated ductal cells, and triggers the 
release of water and  HCO3– and Na+, through a 
Na+– HCO3– cotransporter into the pancreatic ducts. 
HCO3– ions and the alkaline secretion of Brunner’s 
glands, present in the submucosa of the duodenum, 
neutralize the acidic gastric chyme in the duodenal 
lumen and activate the pancreatic digestive enzymes. 

Pathology: Pancreatitis and cystic ﬁbrosis
Zymogen granules contain inactive proenzymes that 
are  activated  within  the  duodenal  environment.  A

Portal hypertension

An obstruction to blood flow in the liver

   Portal hypertension increases the

aggravated by reduced plasma oncotic

ticular trypsinogen to trypsin, and the inactivation of 
trypsin inhibitor (tightly bound to the active site of 
trypsin), result  in the autodigestion of the pancreatic 
gland following their release into the interstitium.

This condition, known to occur in acute pancreati-
tis, usually follows trauma, heavy meals or excessive 
alcohol ingestion or biliary tract disease. 

The clinical features of acute pancreatitis are severe 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A rapid eleva-
tion of amylase and lipase in serum (within 24 to 72 
hours)  are  typical  diagnostic  features. The  normal 
structure and function of the pancreas are normalized 
when the cause of pancreatitis is removed. However, 
acute pancreatitis can give rise to complications, such 
as abscess formation and cysts.

Chronic  pancreatitis  is  characterized  by  ﬁbrosis 
and  partial  or  total  destruction  of  the  pancreatic 
tissue. Alcoholism is the major cause of chronic pan-
creatitis, leading to a permanent loss of pancreatic 
endocrine and exocrine functions.

Cystic ﬁbrosis is an inherited, autosomal recessive 

disease affecting the function of mucus-secreting tis-
sues of the respiratory (see Chapter 13, Respiratory 
System),  intestinal,  and  reproductive  systems;  the 
sweat glands of the skin (see Chapter 11, Integumen-
tary System); and the exocrine pancreas in children 
and young adults. 

A thick sticky mucus obstructs the duct passages 
of the airways, pancreatic and biliary ducts, and in-
testine, followed by bacterial infections and damage 
of the functional tissues. Some affected babies have 
meconium ileus, a blockage of the intestine that oc-
curs soon after birth.

A  large  number  of  patients  (85%)  have  chronic 
pancreatitis characterized by a loss of acini and dila-
tion of the pancreatic excretory ducts into cysts sur-
rounded by extensive ﬁbrosis (hence the designation 
cystic ﬁbrosis of the pancreas).  

Insufﬁcient exocrine pancreatic secretions cause  the 
malabsorption of fat and protein, reﬂected by bulky 
and fatty stools (steatorrhea).

CFTR, is responsible  for cystic ﬁbrosis. 

The disease is detected by the demonstration of 
increased concentration of NaCl in sweat. Children 
with cystic ﬁbrosis “taste salty” after copious sweating.

Liver
The  liver,  the  largest  gland  in  the  human  body, 
consists  of  four  poorly  deﬁned  lobes. The  liver  is 
surrounded  by  a  collagen-elastic  ﬁber–containing 
capsule (of Glisson) and is lined by the peritoneum. 
Blood is supplied to the liver by two blood vessels 

(Figure 17-10): 

1. The portal vein (75% to 80% of the afferent 
blood volume) transports blood from the digestive 
tract, spleen, and pancreas. 

2. The hepatic artery, a branch of the celiac trunk, 
supplies  20%  to  25%  of  oxygenated  blood  to  the 
liver by the interlobar artery and interlobular artery 
pathway before reaching the portal space. 

Blood from branches of the portal vein and the 
hepatic  artery  mixes  in  the  sinusoids  of  the  liver 
lobules, as we discuss in detail later. 

Sinusoidal blood converges at the central venule

of the liver lobule. 

Central venules converge to form the sublobular 
veins,  and  blood  returns  to  the  inferior  vena  cava
following  the  collecting  veins  and  hepatic  veins
pathway.

The right and left hepatic bile ducts leave the liver 
and merge to form the hepatic duct. The hepatic duct 
becomes the common bile duct soon after giving rise 
to the  cystic duct, a thin tube connecting the bile 
duct to the gallbladder (see Figure 17-10).

General organization of the hepatic lobule
The  structural  and  functional  unit  of  the  liver  is 
the  hepatic  lobule. The  hepatic  lobule  consists  of 
anastomosing plates of hepatocytes limiting blood 
sinusoidal spaces (Figure 17-11). 

A central venule (or vein) in the core of the hepatic 
lobule  collects  the  sinusoidal  blood  transporting  a 
mixture of blood supplied by branches of the portal 
vein and the hepatic artery.

Branches  of  the  hepatic  artery  and  portal  vein, 
together with a bile duct, form the classic portal triad
found in the portal space surrounding the hexagonal-
shaped hepatic lobule (Figure 17-12).

A portal lobule includes portions of those lobules 
whose bile canaliculi drain into the same bile

    The boundaries of a portal lobule are the 
central veins of three classic lobules. The center 
of the portal lobule is the bile duct collecting the 
bile from all canaliculi.

3

 Liver acinus

The three zones of a liver acinus are defined by 
hepatic tissue receiving blood from a branch of 
the hepatic artery conducting blood to opposite 
central veins. The direction of arterial flow 
determines a metabolic gradient from the 
periportal space near the portal triad (zone I) 
to the zone of drainage (zone III).

         In zone I (periportal), hepatocytes actively 
I
synthesize glycogen and plasma proteins. Oxygen 
concentration in sinusoidal blood is high.

     Zone II is an 
II
intermediate region.

        Zone III (central venous drainage) is the region 
III
where oxygen concentration is the poorest. Zone III 
has a role in detoxification. Hepatocytes are 
susceptible to damage caused by hypoxia.

Bile produced in the hepatocytes is secreted into 
narrow  intercellular  spaces,  the  bile  canaliculi, 
located  between  the  apposed  surfaces  of  adjacent 
hepatocytes. Bile ﬂows in the opposite direction to 
the blood. Bile ﬂows from the bile canaliculi into 
periportal bile ductules (cholangioles, or canals of 
Hering), and then into the bile ducts (or ductules) 
of the portal space after crossing the hepatic plate at 

the periphery of the hepatic lobule (see Figure 17-11). 
Bile ductules converge at the intrahepatic bile ducts. 

Functional views of the hepatic lobule 
There  are  three  conceptual  interpretations  of  the 
architecture of the liver lobule (see Figure 17-12): 

1. The classic concept of the hepatic lobule, based 

on structural parameters.

        The perisinusoidal space of Disse 
separates the basolateral domain of the 
hepatocyte from blood circulating in the 
hepatic sinusoid. 
    The space of Disse contains types I, III, 
and IV collagen fibers. Protein absorption 
and secretion take place across the 
narrow space of Disse (0.2 to 0.5 (cid:43)m 
wide).

2
        The space of Mall, found at the 
periphery of the hepatic lobule, is 
continuous with the space of Disse. The 
space of Mall is drained by lymphatic 
vessels piercing the limiting plate.   
    Lymphatic vessels surround the blood 
vessels and bile ductules in the portal 
space.

        The canal of Hering (or cholangiole)

is the terminal point of the network of bile 
canalicular trenches found on the 
hepatocyte surfaces. 
   The canal of Hering is located at the 
periphery of the hepatic lobule (periportal 
site), is lined by a squamous-to-cuboidal 
simple epithelium, and connects with the 
bile ductules in the portal space after 
perforating the limiting plate.

The connective tissue of the portal space provides support to the portal triad

in the portal space (also designated portal canal, portal area, or portal tract). 

Note that blood and bile and lymph flow in opposite directions

2. The portal lobule concept, based on the bile 
drainage pathway from adjacent lobules toward the 
same bile duct.

3. The liver acinus concept, based on the gradient 
distribution of oxygen along the venous sinusoids of 
adjacent lobules. 

The classic hepatic lobule is customarily described 
as a polyhedral structure, usually depicted as a hexa-
gon with a central venule to which blood sinusoids 
converge (see Figure 17-12). 

Components  of  the  portal  triad,  constituting  a 
branch of the portal vein and hepatic artery and a bile 
duct, are usually found at the angles of the hexagon. 
This  geometric  organization  is  poorly  deﬁned  in 
humans because the limiting perilobular connective 
tissue is not abundant. However, recognition of the 
components of the portal triad is helpful in deter-
mining the boundaries of the human hepatic lobule.
In the portal lobule, the portal triad is the central 
axis,  draining  bile  from  the  surrounding  hepatic 
parenchyma.

Functional considerations have modiﬁed the classic 

view and a liver acinus concept has gained ground in 
pathophysiology. In the liver acinus, the boundaries 
are determined by a terminal branch of the hepatic 
artery. The ﬂow of   arterial blood within the venous 
sinusoids creates gradients of oxygen and nutrients 
classiﬁed as zones I, II, and III. 

Zone  I  is  the  richest  in  oxygen  and  nutrients. 
Zone III, closer to the central vein, is oxygen-poor. 
Zone II is intermediate in oxygen and nutrients (see 
Figure 17-12). 

Although pathologic changes in the liver are usually 
described in relation to the classic lobule, the liver 
acinus concept is convenient for understanding liver 
regeneration patterns, liver metabolic activities, and 
the development of cirrhosis. 

Hepatocyte
The hepatocyte is the functional exocrine and en-
docrine cell of the hepatic lobule. Hepatocytes form 
anastomosing  one-cell-thick  plates  limiting  the 
sinusoidal spaces.

The smooth endoplasmic

developed and is always 
associated with clusters of

a hepatic sinusoid. 
Endothelial cells have 
a fenestrated 
cytoplasm associated 
with a discontinuous 
basal lamina. 

 A hepatocyte has distinct domains: apical 
domains, represented by the bile poles, and 
extensive basolateral domains with microvilli 
extending into the space of Disse.

Oxidases produce

into O2 and water.

Bile canaliculus

The bile canaliculus is an 
extracellular canal 
between adjacent 
hepatocytes. The surface 
of this canal displays 
microvilli.  
    Bile released into the 
canaliculus is drained by 
the canal of Hering, or 
cholangiole, an 
epithelial-lined ductule in  
the periportal space.  
    The canal of Hering 
carries the bile to the bile 
ductules, one of the three 
components of the portal 
space.

Space of Disse
The space of Disse, 
between the sinusoid and 
the basolateral domain of 
hepatocytes, enables an 
exchange between blood 
and hepatocytes. 
   Hepatocyte absorptive 
function is enhanced by 
the microvilli extending 
into the space of Disse. 
Collagen fibers are found 
in this space.

The ADH is the major pathway. Alcohol is oxidized to acetaldehyde in 
the cytoplasm and acetaldehyde is converted to acetate in 
mitochondria. 
    An excess of H+ and acetaldehyde causes mitochondrial damage, 
disrupts microtubules, and alters proteins that can induce autoimmune 
responses leading to hepatocyte injury.

The MEOS pathway is significant during the chronic intake of alcohol.  In 
contrast to the ADH pathway that produces acetaldehyde and excess H+, the 
MEOS pathway produces acetaldehyde and an excess of oxygen radicals.  
    Reactive oxygen produces injury to hepatocytes by causing lipid peroxidation, 
resulting in cell membrane damage.  In addition, an up-regulated MEOS affects 
detoxification activities of the hepatocyte that require cytochrome P-450 for the 
oxidation of various drugs, toxins, vitamins A and D, and potential carcinogens. 
The accumulation of these products is often toxic. 

Large fat deposits in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes 
are observed in fatty liver (steatosis) following 
long-term consumption of alcohol.

space of Disse is collected in the space of Mall, located 
at  the  periphery  of  the  hepatic  lobule.  Lymphatic 
vessels  piercing  the  limiting  plate  drain  the  ﬂuid 
of the space of Mall. Gap junctions on the lateral 
surfaces of adjacent hepatocytes enable intercellular 
functional coupling. 

The basolateral domain participates in the absorp-
tion of blood-borne substances and in the secretion 
of  plasma  proteins  (such  as  albumin,  ﬁbrinogen, 
prothrombin, and coagulation factors V, VII, and 
IX). Note that hepatocytes synthesize several plasma 
proteins  required  for  blood  clotting  (see  Chapter 
6,  Blood  and  Hematopoiesis).  Blood  coagulation 

disorders are associated with liver disease. 

The apical domain borders the bile canaliculus, a 
trenchlike depression lined by microvilli and sealed 
at the sides by occluding junctions to prevent leakage 
of bile, the exocrine product of the hepatocyte (see 
Figure 17-15). 

The hepatocyte contains rough endoplasmic re-
ticulum (see Figure 17-14), involved in the synthesis 
of plasma proteins, and a highly developed smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum, associated with the synthesis 
of glycogen, lipid, and detoxiﬁcation mechanisms 
(Figure 17-16). Enzymes inserted in the membrane 
of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum are involved 
in the following functions:

Hepatitis viral infection causes injury of hepatocytes. Persistent virus 
replication in hepatocytes causes chronic liver disease, which may progress 
to fibrogenesis, cirrhosis and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. During 
chronic liver disease, proinflammatory cytokines are produced: tumor necrosis

2. The glucuronide conjugation of bilirubin, ste-

4. The esteriﬁcation of free fatty acids to triglyc-

erides.

5. The removal of iodine from the thyroid hor-

mones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).

6. The detoxiﬁcation of lipid-soluble drugs such 
as phenobarbital, during which the smooth endo-
plasmic reticulum is signiﬁcantly developed.

The Golgi apparatus contributes to glycosylation 
of  secretory  proteins  and  the  sorting  of  lysosomal 
enzymes. 

Lysosomes  degrade  aged  plasma  glycoproteins 
internalized at the basolateral domain by a hepatic  
lectin  membrane  receptor,  the  asialoglycoprotein 
receptor, with binding afﬁnity to terminal galactose 
after the removal of sialic acid. Lysosomes in hepa-
tocytes store iron, which can exist as soluble ferritin 
and insoluble hemosiderin, the degradation product 
of ferritin.

 

Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are membrane-bound organelles with 
a high content of oxidases and catalases for the (cid:96)-
oxidation of fatty acids and production and  break-
down of hydrogen peroxide. 

Because hydrogen peroxide is a toxic metabolite, 
the  enzyme  catalase  degrades  this  product  into 
oxygen  and  water. This  catalytic  event  occurs  in 
hepatocytes and cells of the kidneys. 

Peroxisomes derive from preexisting preperoxi-
somes budding off from the endoplasmic reticulum 
or by ﬁssion from pre-existing peroxisomes. Then, the 
organelle imports peroxisomal matrix proteins from 
the cytosol, targeted to peroxisomes by peroxisome 
targeting signals. 

Peroxisomes contain peroxins, proteins involved 
in peroxisome biogenesis. Some of the peroxins are 
defective and associated with peroxisome biogenesis 
disorders, including Zellweger syndrome. 

The biogenesis of peroxisomes and their role in 
inherited disorders are outlined in Chapter 2, Epi-
thelial Glands.

is  a  hereditary  disorder  of  copper  metabolism  in 
which excessive deposits of copper in liver and brain 
lysosomes produce chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.

Pathology:  Alcoholism  and  fatty  liver  (alcoholic 
steatohepatitis)
After  absorption  in  the  stomach,  most  ethanol  is 
transported to the liver, where it is metabolized to 
acetaldehyde and acetate in the hepatocytes. Etha-
nol  is  mainly  oxidized  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase, 
an NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide)–dependent enzyme. This mechanism 
is  known  as  the  alcohol  dehydrogenase  (ADH) 
pathway.  An  additional  metabolic  pathway  is  the 
microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), pres-
ent in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  The  two 
pathways are summarized in Figure 17-17. 

Long-term consumption of ethanol results in fatty 
liver (a reversible process if ethanol consumption is 
discontinued), steatohepatitis (fatty liver accompa-
nied by an inﬂammatory reaction), cirrhosis (collagen 
proliferation  or  ﬁbrosis),  and  hepatocellular  carci-
noma (malignant transformation of hepatocytes).

The production of tumor necrosis factor ligand 
(TNFL) is one of the initial events in liver injury. 
TNFL(cid:3) triggers  the  production  of  other  cytokines. 
TNFL,  regarded  as  a  proinﬂammatory  cytokine, 
recruits  inﬂammatory  cells  that  cause  hepatocyte 
injury and promote the production of type I collagen 
ﬁbers by perisinusoidal cells of Ito (a process known 
as ﬁbrogenesis) as a healing response. 

Injury of hepatocytes results in programmed cell 
death, or apoptosis, caused by the activation of cas-
pases (see Chapter 3, Cell Signaling). TNFL(cid:3)partici-
pates in a number of inﬂammatory processes such as 
in the articular joints (Chapter 5, Osteogenesis) and 
the extravasation of inﬂammatory cells (Chapter 10, 
Immune-Lymphatic System).

Ethanol, viruses, or toxins induce Kupffer cells 
to synthesize TNFL(cid:3)as well as transforming growth 
factor–(cid:96)(cid:3)(cid:8)TGF-(cid:96)(cid:9) and interleukin-6 (Figure 17-18). 
TGF-(cid:96)(cid:3)stimulates the production of type I collagen 
by  perisinusoidal  cells,  which  increase  in  number. 
TNFL(cid:3)acts on biliary ducts to interfere with the ﬂow 
of bile (cholestasis).

Pathology: Liver iron-overload disorders 
Severe  liver  diseases  can  result  from  the  excessive 
storage of iron and copper. 

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an example of a 
disease  characterized  by  increased  iron  absorption 
and  accumulation  in  lysosomal  hepatocytes.  Cir-
rhosis and cancer of the liver are complications of 
hemochromatosis. We discuss in detail iron-overload 
disorders in Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis.

Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) 

Pathology: Perisinusoidal cells  
Perisinusoidal cells (of Ito; also called hepatic stellate 
cells) are found in the space of Disse in proximity to 
the hepatic sinusoids (see Figure 17-13). 

These cells are of mesenchymal origin, contain fat, 

and are involved in:

1. The storage and release of retinoids.
2. The  production  and  turnover  of  extracellular 

matrix.

3. The regulation of blood ﬂow in the sinusoids.

Perisinusoidal cells remain in a quiescent, nonpro-
liferative state, but can proliferate when activated by 
Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Activation occurs after 
partial hepatectomy (see Box 17-B), focal hepatic le-
sions, and in different conditions that lead to ﬁbrosis 
(Figure 17-18).

In  pathologic  conditions,  perisinusoidal  cells 
change into myoﬁbroblasts and contribute to ﬁbro-
genesis  during  chronic  liver  disease  by  producing 
type I and type II collagens and extracellular matrix 

proteins. Fibrogenesis compromises regeneration.

Once activated, myoﬁbroblasts secrete transform-
ing  growth  factor-(cid:96)  (TGF-(cid:96))  to  stimulate,  by  an 
autocrine mechanism, their own activity and promote 
type 2 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of 
hepatocytes. 

EMT  comprises  the  switch  of  epithelial  cell 
characteristics into a ﬁbroblast-like or mesenchymal 
phenotype.  It  involves  the  suppression  E-cadherin

activation of Wnt/(cid:96)-catenin cell signaling pathways 
and others, that are not active in normal hepatocytes.  
In  Chapter  3,  Cell  Signaling,  we  point  to  three 

types of EMT: 

1. Type 1 EMT occurs during embryonic devel-

opment. 

2. Type 2 EMT takes place during the repair of 
tissue  injury  and  inﬂammation.  Liver  ﬁbrogenesis 
is an example of type 2 EMT. It requires ﬁbroblasts 
and mesenchymal cells to repair acute and chronic 
hepatitis. 

3. Type 3 EMT occurs in cancer and metastasis. A 
possible progression of cirrhosis into hepatocellular 
cancer  occurs when hepatitis Bx (HBx) antigen, a 
regulatory  protein  of  the  hepatitis  B  virus,  stimu-
lates  cancer  stem  cells  into  hepatocellular  cancer 
pathogenesis. 

Cancer  stem  cells  express    stemness-associated 
genes,  such  as  Nanog,  Oct4,  Myc,  Sox2  and  Klf4 
(Krüpel-like factor 4). Remember that stemness is 
the characteristic gene expression pattern of different 
stem cells not observed in ordinary, non-stem cells.
The deposit of collagen and extracellular matrix 
components increases, leading to a progressive ﬁbrosis 
of the liver, a typical feature of cirrhosis.

An increased deposit of collagen ﬁbers and extracel-
lular matrix within the space of Disse is followed by 
a loss of fenestrations and gaps of sinusoidal endo-
thelial cells. As the ﬁbrotic process advances, myo-
ﬁbroblasts constrict the lumen of the sinusoids and 
increase vascular resistance. An increase in resistance 
to the ﬂow of portal venous blood in the hepatic 
sinusoids leads to portal hypertension in cirrhosis.
In summary, hepatocytes have regenerative capa-
bility in response to damage and macrophages secrete 
matrix metalloproteases that breakdown scar tissue 
and enhance hepatocyte proliferation. However, the 
liver extracellular matrix controls the epithelial regen-

 Box 17-B | Liver regeneration

•  The liver has an excellent regenerative potential following acute necrosis 
determined by viral infections or toxins.  However, it undergoes ﬁbrosis after 
chronic injury.
•  After extensive hepatectomy (about 70%), human hepatocytes leave their 
quiescent state and initiate the cell cycle sequence to regenerate the original 
liver mass within a 6-8 week period. 
•  The early phases of the regenerative process involve perisinusoidal cells, 
macrophages, and endothelial cells lining the hepatic sinusoids.  Endothelial 
cells synthesize vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), 
the initial step of a molecular program leading to the production of hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF) to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation.
•  During prolonged liver injury (such as chronic viral hepatitis or excessive 
alcohol intake), perisinusoidal cells change into myoﬁbroblasts and contrib-
ute to ﬁbrogenesis by depositing extracellular matrix. Fibrogenesis disrupts the 
regenerative potential of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells to the point that 
liver regeneration is compromised.  The vascular structures become abnormal, 
collagen bundles surround hepatocytes, and cirrhosis develops.

erative responses. In chronic liver injury, progressive 
ﬁbrosis inhibits liver regeneration.  

Pathology: Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis  
Hepatitis is an inﬂammatory condition of the liver 
determined  predominantly  by  viruses  but  also  by 
bacteria (of intestinal origin or hematogenous) and 
parasites (amebiasis and schistosomiasis).

Viral hepatitis can be caused by hepatotropic vi-
ruses, in particular hepatitis virus A (HAV), B (HBV) 
and C (HCV), the most common. Each type of virus 
belongs to different groups. 

HAV  causes  acute  hepatitis  that  rarely  becomes 
chronic. HAV infections are caused by spread through 
the ingestion of contaminated food or water. 

HBV infection can be determined by sexual contact 
and the transfer of blood or serum through shared 
needles in drug abusers. About 10% of the infected 
individuals develop chronic hepatitis. 

HCV  is  caused  in  about  90%  of  the  cases  by 
blood transfusion and  about 50-70% of the affected 
individuals  develop  chronic  hepatitis. Therapy  of 
HCV infection is based in the oral administration of 
combined direct-acting antiviral agents.  

Other types of viral hepatitis includes virus types 
D, E, and G. Immunity determined by one type of 
virus  does  not  protect  against  infection  caused  by 
other viruses. 

Patients with chronic forms of viral hepatitis, last-
ing more than 6 months, can transmit the infection 
to others with blood or body ﬂuids, and evolve over 
time to cirrhosis or lead to the development of  he-
patocellular cancer (liver cancer).  

Typical clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis 
are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and  jaundice. 

Biochemical abnormalities include:
1. An elevation in serum of liver aminotransfer-
ases (aspartate aminotransferase, AST, and alanine 
aminotrasferase,  ALT),  resulting  from  the  enzyme 
leakage of injured hepatocytes into blood.

2. Viral antibodies detected in blood within weeks 

of infection.  

The  histopathologic  features  of  acute  hepatitis 
are  hepatocyte  injury  (necrosis)  and  apoptosis  and 
accumulation  of  bile  within  hepatocytes.  Inﬂam-
matory  cells,  including  neutrophils,  lymphocytes 
and macrophages, are seen in the sinusoids around 
the central venule (zone III of the liver acinus) and 
portal spaces. 

Chronic  hepatitis  is  deﬁned  by  the  presence  of 
ﬁbrosis,  together  with  hepatocyte  necrosis  and  in-
ﬂammatory lymphocytic activity (see Figure 17-18).   
Disruption  of  the  limiting  plate  (zone  I  of  liver 
acinus), progression of ﬁbrosis into the portal spaces, 
nodular regeneration of hepatocytes and proliferation 
of bile ductules (cholangiolar proliferation) are indica-
tions of a progression to cirrhosis (see Figure 17-18).

Bile consists of bile acids, phospholipids,

   Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent

the transport of bile components. ATP 
changes into adenosine diphosphate 

(ADP). MDR1 transports cholesterol; MDR2 transports phospholipids; 
MOAT exports glutathione conjugates (bilirubin); BAT exports bile 
salts.
   Phospholipids (mainly phosphatidylcholine) solubilize cholesterol 
(preventing the formation of cholesterol gallstones) and reduce the 
detergent action of bile salts in the small intestine. Bile salts emulsify 
dietary lipids in the small intestine. 
   A number of hydrolytic enzymes on the luminal surface of the bile 
canaliculus (ectoenzymes) generate nucleosides and amino acids that 
can be taken up by the ductular epithelial cells.

Bile: Mechanism of secretion
Bile is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic 
substances produced by the hepatocyte, transported 
by the bile canaliculus, an extracellular canal between 
adjacent hepatocytes. The bile canaliculus deﬁnes the 
apical  domain  of  the  hepatocyte. The  basolateral 
domain faces the sinusoidal space. Tight junctions 
between adjacent hepatocytes seal the biliary cana-
licular compartment (Figure 17-19).

The primary organic components of bile are conju-
gated bile acids (called bile salts), glycine, and taurine 
N-acylamidated derivatives of bile acids derived from 
cholesterol. 

Bile has ﬁve major functions: 
1. The excretion of cholesterol, phospholipids, bile 

salts, conjugated bilirubin, and electrolytes.  

2. Contributes to fat absorption in the intestinal 
lumen (see Chapter 16, Lower Digestive Segment).  
3. Transports polymeric IgA to the intestinal mu-

cosa by the enterohepatic circulation. 

4. The excretion of metabolic products of drugs 

and heavy metals processed in the hepatocyte.

5.  Conjugated  bile  acids  inhibit  the  growth  of 

bacteria in the small intestine.

The transport of bile and other organic substances 

from the hepatocyte to the lumen of the bile cana-
liculus is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–mediated 
process. Four ATP-dependent transporters, present 
in the canalicular plasma membrane, participate in  
transport mechanisms of the bile (Figure 17-20). 

1.  Multidrug  resistance  1  transporter  (MDR1), 
which mobilizes cholesterol across the plasma mem-
brane. 

2.  Multidrug  resistance  2  transporter  (MDR2), 

which transports phospholipids. 

3.  Multispecific  organ  anionic  transporter 
(MOAT), which exports bilirubin glucuronide and 
glutathione conjugates. 

4. Biliary acid transporter (BAT), which transports 

bile salts.

These ATP transporters  belong to the family of 
ABC transporters characterized by highly conserved 
ATP-binding domains, or ATP binding cassettes. The 
ﬁrst ABC transporter was discovered as the product 
of the gene mdr (for multiple drug resistance). The 
mdr gene is highly expressed in cancer cells and the 
encoded  product,  MDR  transporter,  pumps  drugs 
out of cells, making cancer cells resistant to cancer 
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. 

The secretion of bile acids generates the osmotic

In blood, bilirubin forms a complex with 
albumin. The bilirubin-albumin 
complex is too large to be excreted in 
urine. This form of bilirubin is 
water-soluble and can enter the brain to 
cause severe neurologic disorders 
(kernicterus) in hemolytic disease of 
the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis).

Lipid-soluble bilirubin, detached from the 
albumin carrier, enters the hepatocyte 
and binds to ligandin, an intracellular 
carrier protein. The bilirubin-ligandin 
complex reaches the smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum and free 
bilirubin is released into the cytosol by 
enzymatic action.

 Intestine

5
In the intestine, glucuronides 
are split and bacteria convert  
bilirubin into urobilinogens, 
which are then excreted in the 
urine (as urobilin), eliminated 
with feces, or returned to the 
liver.  About 20% of the 
urobilinogens are reabsorbed 
in the ileum and colon.

canaliculus. In addition, an ion exchanger enables 
– and Cl– ions. Finally, hydro-
the passage of HCO3
lytic enzymes associated with the plasma membrane 
(ectoenzymes) of the bile canaliculus and bile duct 
produce nucleoside and amino acid breakdown prod-
ucts, which are reabsorbed by ductular epithelial cells.
A genetic defect in MDR2 causes focal hepatocyte 
necrosis, proliferation of bile ductules, and an inﬂam-
matory reaction in the portal space. Very low levels 
of phospholipids are detected in the bile of MDR2 
mutants.

Metabolism of bilirubin
Bilirubin  is  the  end  product  of  heme  catabolism 
and about 85% originates from senescent red blood 
cells destroyed mainly in the spleen by macrophages 
(Figure 17-21).

Bilirubin is released into the circulation, where it is 
bound to albumin and transported to the liver. Unlike 
albumin-bound bilirubin, free bilirubin is toxic to 
the brain. Recall from our discussion of erythroblas-
tosis fetalis (see Chapter 6, Blood and Hematopoiesis) 
that  an  antibody-induced  hemolytic  disease  in  the 
newborn is caused by blood group incompatibility

Bilirubin metabolism

between the mother and fetus. The hemolytic pro-
cess results in hyperbilirubinemia caused by elevated 
amounts of free bilirubin, which causes irreversible 
damage to the central nervous system (kernicterus).
When albumin-conjugated bilirubin reaches the 
hepatic  sinusoids,  the  albumin-bilirubin  complex 
dissociates,  and  bilirubin  is  transported  across  the 
plasma membrane of hepatocytes after binding to a 
plasma membrane receptor. Inside the hepatocyte, 
bilirubin binds to ligandin, a protein that prevents 
bilirubin reﬂux into the circulation. The bilirubin-
ligandin  complex  is  transported  to  the  smooth 
endoplasmic  reticulum,  where  bilirubin  is  conju-
gated to glucuronic acid by the uridine diphosphate 
(UDP)–glucuronyl transferase system. This reaction 
results in the formation of a water-soluble bilirubin 
diglucuronide,  which  diffuses  through  the  cytosol 
into  the  bile  canaliculus,  where  it  is  secreted  into 
the bile.

In the small intestine, conjugated bilirubin in bile 
remains intact until it reaches the distal portion of 
the small intestine and colon, where free bilirubin is 
generated by the intestinal bacterial ﬂora. 

Unconjugated bilirubin is then reduced to urobi-
linogen. Most urobilinogen is excreted in the feces. A 
small portion returns to the liver following absorption 
by a process known as enterohepatic bile circulation. 
Another small fraction is excreted in the urine.

Composition of the bile
The human liver produces about 600 mL of bile per 
day.  The bile consists of organic components (such 
as bile acids, the major component; phospholipids, 
mainly lecithins; cholesterol; and bile pigments, bili-
rubin) and inorganic components (predominantly 
Na+ and Cl– ions). 

Bile  acids  (cholic  acid,  chenodeoxycholic  acid, 
deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid) are synthesized 
by  the  hepatocytes.  Cholic  and  chenodeoxycholic 
acids are synthesized from cholesterol as a precursor 
and are called primary bile acids. Deoxycholic and 
lithocholic acids are called secondary bile acids be-
cause they are produced in the intestinal lumen by the 
action of intestinal bacteria on the primary bile acids. 
The  synthetic  bile  acid  pathway  is  the  major 
mechanism  of  elimination  of  cholesterol  from  the 
body. Micelles are formed by the aggregation of bile 
acid molecules conjugated to taurine or glycine. Cho-
lesterol is located inside the micelles. Bile pigments 
are not components of the micelles.

Bile secreted by the liver is stored in the gallbladder 
and released into the duodenum during a meal to 
facilitate the breakdown and absorption of fats (see 
Figure  16-9  in  Chapter  16,  Lower  Digestive  Seg-
ment). About 90% of both primary and secondary 
bile acids is absorbed from the intestinal lumen by 

enterocytes and transported back to the liver through 
the portal vein. This process is known as the entero-
hepatic circulation. 

The  absorption  of  bile  acids  by  the  enterocyte 
is  mediated  at  the  apical  plasma  membrane  by  an 
Na+-dependent  transporter  protein  and  released 
through  the  basolateral  plasma  membrane  by  an 
Na+-independent anion exchanger.

Bilirubin is not absorbed in the intestine. Bilirubin 
is reduced to urobilinogen by bacteria in the distal 
small intestine and colon (see Figure 17-21). Urobi-
linogen is partially secreted in the feces, part returns 
to  the  liver  through  the  portal  vein,  and  some  is 
excreted in urine as urobilin, the oxidized form of 
urobilinogen. 

Bile acids establish an osmotic gradient that mobi-
lizes water and electrolytes into the bile canaliculus. 
– ions, secreted by epithelial cells lining the bile 
HCO3
ducts, are added to the bile, which becomes alkaline 
as Na+ and Cl– ions and water are absorbed. Secretin 
–  into the bile.
increases the active transport of HCO3
The ﬂow of bile into the duodenum depends on:
1. The secretory pressure generated by the actively 

bile-secreting hepatocytes.

2. The ﬂow resistance in the bile duct and sphincter 

of Oddi. 

The sphincter of Oddi is a thickening of the circular 
muscle layer of the bile duct at the duodenal junc-
tion.  During fasting, the sphincter of Oddi is closed 
and bile ﬂows into the gallbladder. The gallbladder’s 
ability to concentrate bile 5 to 20 times compensates 
for the limited storage capacity of the gallbladder (20 
to 50 mL of ﬂuid) and the continuous production of 
bile by the liver. 

Bile  secretion  during  meal  digestion  is  initiated 
by the cholecystokinin-induced contraction of the 
muscularis of the gallbladder in response to lipids in 
the intestinal lumen, assisted by the muscular activi-
ties of the common bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi, 
and the duodenum. 

Cholecystokinin  stimulates  the  relaxation  of  the 
sphincter of Oddi, enabling bile to enter the duode-
num. Note that cholecystokinin has opposite effects: 
it stimulates muscle contraction of the gallbladder 
and induces muscle relaxation of the sphincter of 
Oddi.

Pathology: Conditions affecting bile secretion
Because bile secretion involves the hepatocytes, bile 
ducts,  gallbladder,  and  intestine,  any  perturbation 
along this pathway can result in a pathologic condi-
tion. For example, destruction of hepatocytes by viral 
infection  (viral  hepatitis)  and  toxins  can  lead  to  a 
decrease in bile production as well as an increase in 
bilirubin in blood (jaundice).

Gallbladder

The major functions of the gallbladder are:
   1. Concentration (up to 10-fold) and storage of bile between 
meals.
   2.  Release of bile by contraction of the muscularis in 
response to cholecystokinin stimulation (produced by 
enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum) and neural stimuli, 
together with relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi 
(a muscular ring surrounding the opening of the bile duct in the 
wall of the duodenum).
   3. Regulation of hydrostatic pressure within the biliary tract.

Clinical significance
Cholestasis defines the impaired formation and excretion of the 
bile at the level of the hepatocyte (intrahepatic cholestasis) or 
a structural (tumor of the pancreas or biliary tract, 
cholangiocarcinoma) or mechanical (cholelithiasis, produced 
by gallstones) perturbation in the excretion of bile (extrahepatic 
cholestasis). 
   Clinically, cholestasis is detected by (1) the presence in blood 
of bilirubin and bile acids, secreted into bile under normal 
conditions; (2) elevation in serum of alkaline phosphatase (an 
enzyme associated with the plasma membrane of the bile 
canaliculus); and (3) radiologic examination (many gallstones 
are radiopaque and can be detected on a plain radiograph).

tract diseases (such as primary sclerosing cholangi-
tis), or tumors (for example, cholangiocarcinoma) 
can block the ﬂow of bile, with bile reﬂux to the liver 
and then to the systemic circulation. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hyperbilirubinemia
Several  diseases  occur  when  one  or  more  of  the 
metabolic steps of bilirubin formation are disrupted. 
A  characteristic  feature  is  hyperbilirubinemia,  an 
increase in the concentration of bilirubin in the blood 
(more than 0.1 mg/mL). 

Gilbert’s syndrome is the most common inborn 
error of metabolism causing  moderate hyperbiliru-
binemia. Elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, 

with no serious  health consequences, are detected in 
the bloodstream. The cause is the reduced activity of 
the enzyme glucuronyl transferase, which conjugates 
bilirubin (see Figure 17-21). 

An  inherited  defect  in  the  UDP–glucuronyl 
transferase system, known as Crigler-Najjar disease, 
results in failure to conjugate bilirubin in hepatocytes 
and the absence of conjugated bilirubin diglucuronide 
in  bile.  Infants  with  this  disease  develop  bilirubin 
encephalopathy.  

The Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a familial disease 
caused by a defect in the transport of conjugated 
bilirubin to the bile canaliculus. In addition to the 
transport of conjugated bilirubin, there is a general

in these patients.

Gallbladder
The main functions of the gallbladder are storage, 
concentration, and release of bile. Dilute bile from 
the hepatic ducts is transported through the cystic 
duct into the gallbladder. After concentration, bile 
is discharged into the common bile duct.

The wall of the gallbladder consists of a mucosa, 
a muscularis, and an adventitia (Figure 17-22). The 
portion of the gallbladder that does not face the liver 

is covered by the peritoneum. 

The  mucosa  displays  multiple  folds  lined  by  a 
simple columnar epithelium and is supported by a 
lamina propria that contains a vascular lymphatic 
plexus. The  mucosa  creates  with  time  deep  clefts 
known as Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. In the neck 
region of the gallbladder, the lamina propria contains 
tubuloacinar glands.

There is no muscularis mucosa and submucosa 
in  the  gallbladder. The  muscularis  is  represented 
by smooth muscle bundles associated with collagen 
and elastic ﬁbers.

Essential concepts

Digestive Glands

• The three major digestive glands are:
  (1) The salivary glands: the parotid, subman-
dibular, and sublingual glands.
  (2) The exocrine pancreas.
  (3) The liver.

• Salivary glands consist of branched ducts and 
secretory portions, acini, producing a mucous, 
serous, or mucous-serous product. They are 
classiﬁed as branched (compound) tubuloal-
veolar glands.

  Each acinus is drained sequentially by:
  (1) An intercalated duct, lined by low 
squamous-to-cuboidal simple epithelium. An 
intercalated duct links an acinus to a striated 
duct.
  (2) A striated duct, lined by a cuboidal-to-
columnar simple epithelium with abundant 
basal mitochondria. The striated duct is well 
developed in the submandibular gland.
  Intercalated and striated ducts are seen 
within a lobule. They are intralobular ducts.
   Striated ducts converge toward interlobular 
ducts found between lobules in the interlobu-
lar septa. They are lined by a pseudostratiﬁed 
columnar epithelium. 
  Interlobular ducts merge with lobar ducts 
located in interlobar septa. They are lined by a 
stratiﬁed columnar epithelium. 
  Lobar ducts join the main duct, which dis-
plays a stratiﬁed squamous epithelium near its 
opening in the oral cavity. 
  Connective tissue septa provide support to 
the branching duct system. Blood vessels, 
lymphatics, and nerves are found in the septa 
along the ducts.

  Saliva is the major product of salivary glands. 
Saliva contains protein, glycoproteins, ions, 
water, and immunoglobulin A. Submandibular 
glands produce 70% of the saliva; the parotid 
glands contribute 25%. Proteins in saliva form 
pellicles, a protective ﬁlm on the teeth.
  The main products in saliva are:
  (1) Lysozyme, which attacks the walls of 
bacteria.
  (2) Lactoferrin, which chelates iron necessary 
for bacterial growth.

  (3) SIgA, which neutralizes bacteria and 
viruses. 
  The digestive function of saliva relies on:
  (1) Amylase (ptyalin), which initiates the 
digestion of  carbohydrates (starch) in the oral 
cavity.
  (2) Lingual lipase, which participates in the 
hydrolysis of dietary lipids.

  The parotid gland consists of serous acini 
surrounded by myoepithelial cells. The parotid 
gland has the longest intercalated ducts.
  The submandibular gland contains mixed 
seromucous and serous acini, also surrounded 
by myoepithelial cells. Serous cells form 
demilunes capping the mucous cells of the 
serous-mucous acinus. Secretion of the serous 
cells is transported to the acinar lumen along 
intercellular secretory canaliculi. 
  The sublingual gland has predominant 
mucous acini; a few seromucous acini can 
be found. Myoepithelial cells are present. 
The intercalated and striated ducts are poorly                   
developed.

• The two most frequent benign tumors of the 
parotid gland are:
  (1) The slow-growing salivary gland mixed 
tumor (pleomorphic adenoma). This tumor 
consists of myxochondroid zones with ductal 
epithelial and mesenchyme-like myoepithelial 
cells. Its surgical removal is complicated by 
the need to protect the facial nerve running 
through the parotid gland. Enucleation of 
mixed tumors results in a multifocal high recur-
rence rate.
  (2) Warthin tumor (papilloma cystoad-
enoma lymphomatosum). This tumor  occurs 
in the parotid gland with a high risk incidence 
in smokers. The tumor stroma consist of a 
papillary arrangement of lymphoid tissue 
centers surrounded by squamous, mucous, 
and sebaceous epithelial cells. This tumor may 
develop from intraparotid or periparotid lymph 
nodes. 

•  Exocrine pancreas. The pancreas is a com-
bined exocrine branched tubuloacinar gland 
and endocrine gland (islet of Langerhans). 

  The pancreas is surrounded by a connective 
tissue but does not have a capsule proper. 
Lobules are separated by connective tissue 
partitions. 
  The pancreatic acinus contains serous-
secreting cells and centroacinar cells, unique 
to the pancreas. Intercalated ducts, lined by a 
low cuboidal epithelium, drain the acinus. 
  Neither striated ducts nor myoepithelial cells 
are present in the exocrine pancreas. 
  Intercalated ducts converge to form inter-
lobular ducts lined by a simple columnar 
epithelium.
  Secretin and cholecystokinin regulate the 
function of the pancreatic acinus and interca-
lated duct. Cholecystokinin and acetylcholine 
trigger the release of inactive forms of trypsin, 
chymotrypsin, and carboxylpeptidases pro-
duced by the pancreatic acinar cells. Lipase, 
amylase, cholesterol esterase, and phospholi-
pase are also secreted. Secretin stimulates the 
secretion of water, sodium, and bicarbonate 
ions by  centroacinar cells and epithelial cells 
of the intercalated duct.

   Acute pancreatitis is the result of pancre-
atic tissue autodigestion by the premature 
activation of pancreatic enzymes, in particular 
trypsin. 
  This condition usually follows trauma, heavy 
meals or excessive alcohol ingestion or biliary 
tract disease. The clinical features of acute 
pancreatitis are severe abdominal pain, nau-
sea, and vomiting. 
  A rapid elevation of amylase and lipase in 
serum (within 24 to 72 hours) are typical 
diagnostic features. Acute pancreatitis can give 
rise to complications, such as abscess forma-
tion and cysts.

  Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by 
ﬁbrosis and partial or total destruction of the 
pancreatic tissue. Alcoholism is the major 
cause of chronic pancreatitis, leading to a 
permanent loss of pancreatic endocrine and 
exocrine functions.

  Cystic ﬁbrosis is an inherited disease affect-
ing mucus-secreting tissues of the respiratory,

digestive, reproductive, and integumentary sys-
tems. Chronic pancreatitis in cystic ﬁbrosis is 
characterized by a loss of acini, dilation of the 
pancreatic excretory ducts, and extensive ﬁbro-
sis (increase in connective tissue). A genetic 
defect in the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein prevents 
the transport of chloride ions. Mucus becomes 
thick and prone to bacterial infections.

•  Carcinoma of the pancreas. The pancre-
atic duct–bile duct anatomic relationship is 
of clinical signiﬁcance in carcinoma of the 
pancreas localized in the head region, because  
compression of the bile duct causes obstruc-
tive jaundice.
  Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most com-
mon primary malignant tumor of the pancreas.  
Tumoral masses obstruct and dilate the distal 
common bile and pancreatic ducts. Hyperpla-
sia and carcinoma in situ of the duct epithelial 
lining are the precursor changes of the inﬁltrat-
ing ductal adenocarcinoma. 
  Activation of the oncogene K-ras and inac-
tivation of tumor suppressor genes, including 
p53, are molecular characteristics of the tumor.

  The close association of the pancreas with 
large blood vessels, the extensive and  diffuse 
abdominal drainage to lymph nodes, and the 
frequent spread of carcinoma cells to the liver 
via the portal vein are factors contributing 
to the ineffectiveness of surgical removal of  
pancreatic tumors.

  Cystic tumors of the pancreas.This category 
includes serous cystoadenomas (with cysts 
containing a clear ﬂuid) and mucinous cys-
toadenomas (with cysts ﬁlled with a mucoid 
product). Untreated mucinous cystoadenomas 
evolve into an inﬁltrating tumor (mucinous 
cystoadenocarcinoma).
  Endocrine tumors of the pancreas can be 
detected as isolated pancreatic masses or a 
component of the multiple endocrine neopla-
sia syndrome, type 1 (MEN1). MEN1 is an au-
tosomal dominant hereditary endocrine cancer 
syndrome characterized primarily by tumors of 
the parathyroid glands, gastroenteroendocrine 
cells, and adenohypophysis. 
  This tumor type does not show activation 
of the K-ras gene or p53 gene inactivation. 
Mutations in the MEN1 (producing the tumor 
suppressor menin), RET  (Ret protoncogene 
producing receptor tyrosine kinase), and 
CDKN1B (for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibi-
tor 1B, encoding the tumor suppressor p27) 
genes can cause MENs. 

  Gastrinomas, insulinomas, and glucagono-
mas are examples of endocrine tumors show-
ing cytoplasmic secretory granules. This tumors 
belong to the category of syndromic function-
ing tumors (associated with a syndrome). For 
example, as we have already seen, gastrino-
mas produce the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 
characterized by multiple peptic ulcers caused 
by gastrin continuous stimulation of HCl pro-
duction by parietal cells in stomach.

• Liver. The liver consists of poorly deﬁned 
lobes surrounded by a collagen–elastic ﬁber 
capsule (of Glisson). 
  Blood is supplied by two vessels: 
  (1) The portal vein supplies 75% to 80% of 
the afferent deoxygenated blood volume from 
the digestive tract, spleen, and pancreas.
  (2) The hepatic artery supplies 20% to 25% 
of oxygenated blood. 
  Blood from the portal vein and hepatic 
artery mixes in the hepatic sinusoid of the 
liver lobules. Sinusoidal blood converges to 
the central venule (or vein), and is drained 
sequentially by the sublobular vein, collecting 
vein, and hepatic vein into the inferior vena 
cava. 
  Bile, the exocrine product of the liver, is 
collected by the intrahepatic bile duct, and 
drained by the right and left hepatic ducts. 
Bile is stored in the gallbladder and released 
in the descending second part of the duode-
num through the common bile duct.

  The hepatic lobule is the structural and 
functional unit of the liver. The hepatic 
lobule consists of anastomosing plates of 
hepatocytes limiting blood sinusoidal spaces 
lined by endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. 
The space of Disse is interposed between 
the sinusoidal space and the hepatocytes. 
Perisinusoidal cells of Ito (the storage site 
of retinoids) are present in the space of 
Disse. A central venule (or vein) collects the 
sinusoidal blood. 

556

 17. DIGESTIVE GLANDS

Essential concepts

  Branches of the portal vein and hepatic ar-
tery, together with a bile duct, form the portal 
triad found in the connective tissue surround-
ing the hepatic lobule.
 
  A limiting plate of hepatocytes is the 
boundary between the hepatocyte paren-
chyma and the connective tissue stroma. 

  Bile, produced by hepatocytes, ﬂows in 
opposite direction to the blood. Bile is trans-
ported through bile canaliculi into the canal of 
Hering (or cholangiole), and then into the bile 
duct in the portal triad space.

• The liver lobule can be conceptualized as:
  (1) The classic hepatic lobule (described 
above).
  (2) The portal lobule, based on the bile 
drainage pathway; the portal triad is the 
center of the portal lobule.
  (3) The liver acinus, based on the zone gra-
dient distribution of deoxygenated–oxygen-
ated blood along the sinusoidal spaces). 

• The hepatocyte is the functional endocrine 
and exocrine cell of the liver. The hepatocyte 
has a basolateral domain with abundant 
microvilli extending into the space of Disse. 
Excess of ﬂuid in the space of Disse, not 
absorbed by the hepatocytes, is drained into 
the lymphatic circulation through the space of 
Mall located adjacent to the limiting plate. 
  The basolateral domain participates in 
the absorption of blood-borne substances 
(for example, bilirubin, peptide and steroid 
hormones, vitamin B12, and substances to 
be detoxiﬁed), and the secretion of plasma 
proteins (for example, albumin, ﬁbrino-
gen, prothrombin, coagulation factors, and 
complement proteins). 
   The apical domain borders the bile 
canaliculus, a trenchlike depression lined by 
microvilli and sealed by tight junctions. 
   Hepatocytes contain smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum (SER) associated with glycogen 
inclusions. The functions of the SER include:
  (1) Synthesis of cholesterol and bile salts.
  (2) Glucuronide conjugation of bilirubin, 
steroids, and drugs. 
  (3) The breakdown of glycogen into glu-
cose.
  (4) The detoxiﬁcation of lipid-soluble drugs 
(for example, phenobarbital). 
  The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and 
Golgi apparatus participate in the synthesis 
and glycosylation of the secretory proteins 
indicated above. Peroxisomes are prominent 
in hepatocytes.

  Severe liver diseases can result from the 
excessive storage of iron and copper. 
  Hereditary hemochromatosis is an example 
of a disease characterized by increased iron 
absorption and accumulation in lysosomal 
hepatocytes. Cirrhosis and cancer of the liver 
are complications of hemochromatosis. 
  Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degen-
eration) is a hereditary disorder of copper 
metabolism in which excessive deposits of 

copper in liver and brain lysosomes produce 
chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.

• Alcoholism and fatty liver. Hepatocytes 
participate in the metabolism of ethanol. 
Long-term consumption of ethanol results 
in fatty liver, a reversible process if alcohol 
ingestion is discontinued. If alcohol consump-
tion continues, hepatocyte injury can lead to 
cirrhosis (collagen proliferation of ﬁbrosis of 
the liver) and hepatocellular carcinoma (ma-
lignant transformation of hepatocytes). 
   Ethanol can be metabolized by the alcohol 
dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway, and the mi-
crosomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). 
   In the ADH pathway, ethanol is oxidized to 
acetaldehyde in the cytoplasm and acetalde-
hyde is converted to acetate in mitochondria. 
Excess of acetaldehyde and protons can 
cause hepatocyte injury. 
  In the MEOS pathway, ethanol  metabolized 
in the SER produces acetaldehyde and excess 
of oxygen radicals (instead of protons). Both 
produce hepatocyte injury.
    
• The perisinusoidal cell (of Ito) is found in 
the space of Disse, in the proximity of hepatic 
sinusoids. 
  These cells:
  (1) Store and release retinoids.
  (2) Produce and turn over extracellular 
matrix components.
  (3) Regulate blood ﬂow in the sinusoids.

  Perisinusoidal cells remain in a quiescent, 
nonproliferative state, but can proliferate 
when activated by Kupffer cells and hepato-
cytes. Activation occurs after partial hepatec-
tomy, focal hepatic lesions, and in different 
conditions that lead to ﬁbrosis.
  In pathologic conditions, perisinusoidal cells 
change into myoﬁbroblasts and contribute to 
ﬁbrogenesis during chronic liver disease by 
producing type I and type II collagens and 
extracellular matrix proteins. 
  Once activated, myoﬁbroblasts secrete 
transforming growth factor-(cid:96) (TGF-(cid:96)) to 
stimulate, by an autocrine mechanism, their 
own activity and promote type 2 epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepato-
cytes.
  Let us review the highlights of EMT:
  (1) Type 1 EMT occurs during embryonic 
development. 
  (2) Type 2 EMT takes place during the 
repair of tissue injury and inﬂammation. Liver 
ﬁbrogenesis is an example of type 2 EMT. It 
requires ﬁbroblasts and mesenchymal cells to 
repair acute and chronic hepatitis. 
  (3) Type 3 EMT occurs in cancer and metas-
tasis. A possible progression of cirrhosis into 
hepatocellular cancer  occurs when hepatitis 
Bx (HBx) antigen, a regulatory protein of the 
hepatitis B virus, stimulates cancer stem cells 
into hepatocellular cancer pathogenesis.
 
• Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Hepati-
tis is an inﬂammatory condition of the liver 
determined predominantly by viruses but also 
by bacteria (of intestinal origin or hema-

togenous) and parasites (amebiasis and 
schistosomiasis).
  Viral hepatitis can be caused by hepato-
tropic viruses, in particular hepatitis virus 
A (HAV), B (HBV), and C (HCV), the most 
common.  
  (1) HAV causes acute hepatitis that rarely 
becomes chronic. HAV infections are caused 
by spread through the ingestion of contami-
nated food or water. 
  (2) HBV infection can be determined by 
sexual contact and the transfer of blood or 
serum through shared needles in drug abus-
ers. About 10% of the infected individuals 
develop chronic hepatitis. 
  (3) HCV is caused in about 90% of the 
cases by blood transfusion and  about 
50-70% of the affected individuals develop 
chronic hepatitis. Therapy of HCV infection is 
based in the oral administration of combined 
direct-acting antiviral agents.  
  Other types of viral hepatitis includes virus 
types D, E, and G. Immunity determined by 
one type of virus does not protect against 
infection caused by other viruses.
  Typical clinical manifestations of acute 
hepatitis are loss of appetite, nausea, vomit-
ing, and  jaundice. 
  Biochemical abnormalities include:
  (1) An elevation in serum of liver amino-
transferases (aspartate aminotransferase, 
AST, and alanine aminotrasferase, ALT), 
resulting from the enzyme leakage of injured 
hepatocytes into blood.
  (2) Viral antibodies detected in blood 
within weeks of infection.
  The histopathologic features of acute hep-
atitis are hepatocyte injury (necrosis) and 
apoptosis and accumulation of bile within 
hepatocytes. Inﬂammatory cells, including 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, 
are seen in the sinusoids around the central 
venule (zone III of the liver acinus) and portal 
spaces. 
  Chronic hepatitis is deﬁned by the pres-
ence of ﬁbrosis, together with hepatocyte ne-
crosis and inﬂammatory lymphocytic activity. 
Disruption of the limiting plate (zone I of liver 
acinus), progression of ﬁbrosis into the portal 
spaces, nodular regeneration of hepatocytes, 
and proliferation of bile ductules (cholangio-
lar proliferation) are indications of a possible 
progression to cirrhosis.   
 
• Bile is a mixture of organic and inorganic 
substances produced by the hepatocyte. Bile 
participates in the excretion of cholesterol, 
phospholipids, bile salts, conjugated bilirubin, 
and electrolytes. Fat absorption in the intes-
tinal lumen depends on the fat-emulsifying 
function of bile salts. Bile transports IgA to 
the intestinal mucosa (enterohepatic circula-
tion), and inhibits bacterial growth in the 
small intestine. 
   The secretion of bile into the bile canalicu-
lus is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-medi-
ated process involving multidrug resistance 1 
and 2 transporters (MDR1 and MDR2), mul-
tispeciﬁc organ anionic transporter (MOAT), 
and biliary acid transporter (BAT).

• Metabolism of bilirubin. Bilirubin is the end 
product of heme catabolism:
  (1) About 85% of bilirubin originates from 
senescent red blood cells destroyed in the 
spleen by macrophages. 
  (2) Macrophages convert heme into biliver-
din, which is transformed into unconjugated 
bilirubin released into the blood circulation. 
  (3) In the blood circulation, bilirubin forms a 
complex with albumin. 
  (4) When the bilirubin-albumin complex 
reaches the hepatic sinusoids, albumin 
detaches and bilirubin is internalized by the 
hepatocyte. 
  (5) Bilirubin binds to ligandin in the hepa-
tocyte cytosol and is transported to the SER, 

which releases free bilirubin that becomes 
conjugated with glucuronic acid. 
  (6) Bilirubin glucuronide is released into 
the bile canaliculus and transported to the 
small intestine. Glucuronide separates from 
bilirubin in the small intestine and bilirubin is 
converted by intestinal bacteria into urobilino-
gen, which is excreted. Urobilin is eliminated 
by urine. 

  Hyperbilirubinemia, an increase in the con-
centration of bilirubin circulating in blood, can 
occur when bilirubin cannot be conjugated 
in the hepatocyte (Crigler-Najjar disease). 
Infants with this disease develop bilirubin 
encephalopathy. 

  A defect in the transport of conjugated 
bilirubin to the bile canaliculus is the cause 
of the Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Gilbert’s 
syndrome is a common inborn error of 
metabolism causing  moderate hyperbilirubi-
nemia without signiﬁcant clinical manifesta-
tions. 

• The gallbladder is the storage, concentra-
tion, and release site of bile. The wall of the 
gallbladder consists of a mucosa with folds 
and deep clefts, lined by a simple columnar 
epithelium. There are no muscularis mucosa 
and submucosa. A muscularis (smooth 
muscle) and adventitia can be seen. Blood 
vessels predominate in the adventitia.

PART V  |  ORGAN SYSTEMS: THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

18. Neuroendocrine System

The neuroendocrine system combines functions of the nervous system and the endocrine system aimed at 
the regulation of several physiologic processes. A key component of the neuroendocrine system is the hypo-
thalamus, a site where neurons, acting as neurosecretory cells, release their neuropeptides into blood vessels 
to reach the adjacent hypophysis so they can collectively communicate with their target organs and tissues 
and receive information through feedback loops. Furthermore, the hypothalamus regulates the activities of the 
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, including cardiovascular responses and glucose metabolism. 
This chapter addresses the structure and function of the hypophysis and the pineal gland. Both are endocrine 
glands located behind the blood-brain barrier, but their secretory products are released outside the blood-brain 
barrier in a cyclic, rhythmic, or pulsatile manner.

Hypophysis
The hypophysis (Greek hypo, under; physis, growth), 
(also known as the pituitary gland), consists of two 
embryologically distinct tissues (Figure 18-1):

1. The adenohypophysis, the glandular epithelial 

portion.

2. The neurohypophysis, the neural portion. 
The adenohypophysis is formed by three subdivi-

2. The pars tuberalis envelops, like a partial or total 
collar, the infundibular stem or stalk, a neural com-
ponent. Together they make up the pituitary stalk.

3. The pars intermedia, or intermediate lobe, is 
rudimentary in the adult. It is a thin wedge separating 
the pars distalis from the neurohypophysis. 

The neurohypophysis is formed by two subdivi-

sions: 

sions or parts:

1.  The pars distalis, or anterior lobe, is the main 

part of the gland.

1. The pars nervosa, or neural lobe.
2. The infundibulum. The infundibulum, in turn, 
consists of two components: the infundibular process 

Figure 18-1. Regions of the hypophysis (pituitary gland)

The hypothalamus is divided into two symmetric halves by 
the third ventricle. It is limited rostrally by the optic chiasma, 
caudally by the mamillary bodies, laterally by the optic 
tracts, and dorsolaterally by the thalamus.

The pars intermedia, a rudiment of the Ratke’s pouch, 
consists of small colloid–containing folicles and scattered 
epithelial cells.

tuberalis, a collar-like nonsecretory tissue enveloping the infundibulum of the 
neurohypophysis; and (3) the pars intermedia, a narrow wedge forming a cap 
around the pars nervosa (neural lobe). 
    The neurohypophysis consists of two parts: the pars nervosa, or neural 
lobe, and the infundibulum. The infundibulum is formed by two structures: (1) 
the median eminence, a funnel-shaped extension of the hypothalamus; and (2) 
the infundibular process.

Two signaling molecules from the diencephalon control

subsequent development of the pouch rudiment into a 
definitive pouch.  Lhx3 belongs to the family of Lim-type 
homeobox-containing genes.

There are two subtypes of craniopharyngiomas:
(1) Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, 
common in children, and (2) papillary 
craniopharyngioma, frequent in adults.

and the median eminence, a funnel-like extension of 
the hypothalamus.

Embryologic origin of the hypophysis
The anterior hypophysis and neurohypophysis have 
different  embryologic  origins  (Figure  18-2). The 
anterior  hypophysis  derives  from  an  evagination 
(Rathke’s  pouch)  of  the  ectodermal  lining  of  the 
future  oral  cavity  extending  upward    toward  the 
developing neurohypophysis. 

The neurohypophysis develops from an infundibu-
lar downgrowth from the ﬂoor of the diencephalon. 
The  connecting  stem  attached  to  Rathke’s  pouch 
disappears.  However,  the  connecting  stem  of  the 
neurohypophysis remains as the core of the infun-
dibular stem, or stalk. 

Rathke’s  pouch  develops  into  three  different 

regions: 

1. Cells of the anterior surface of the pouch give 

rise to the pars distalis (the bulk of the gland).

2. Cells of the posterior surface invade the infun-

dibular process.

3. Superior extensions of the pouch surround the 

infundibular stem, forming the pars tuberalis.

Hypothalamohypophyseal portal circulation
The  hypothalamus  and  the  hypophysis  form  an 
integrated  neuroendocrine  network  known  as  the 
hypothalamohypophyseal system. 

The hypothalamohypophyseal system consists of 

two components:

1. The hypothalamic adenohypophyseal system, 
connecting  the  hypothalamus  to  the  anterior  hy-
pophysis.

2. The hypothalamic neurohypophyseal system, 
linking the hypothalamus to the posterior hypophysis.

Blood supply to the hypophysis

The superior hypophyseal artery forms a primary capillary 
plexus in the infundibulum (formed by the median eminence and 
infundibular stem). The primary capillary plexus receives releasing 
and inhibitory hormones from the neuroendocrine 
hypothalamohypophysiotropic nuclei.
The primary capillary plexus is drained by portal veins. 
    Portal veins supply blood to the secondary capillary plexus, with 
which basophils and acidophils are associated.  
    By this mechanism, hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory peptides 
act directly on cells of the pars distalis (anterior hypophysis) to 

regulate their endocrine function.
    The primary and secondary capillary plexuses linked by the portal 
veins form the hypothalamohypophyseal portal system.
    The inferior hypophyseal artery supplies the pars nervosa, 
forming a capillary plexus, which collects vasopressin (antidiuretic 
hormone) and oxytocin produced by neuroendocrine cells of the 
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, respectively.
    The superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries are connected by 
the trabecular artery, whose capillaries bypass the portal circulation 
of the adenohypophysis (see     ).

6

The hypothalamus, corresponding to the ﬂoor of 
the diencephalon and forming part of the walls of 
the third ventricle, consists of at least twelve clusters 
of  neurons,  called  nuclei,  some  of  which  secrete 
hormones. 

The neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus ex-
ert positive and negative  effects on the hypophysis 
through neuropeptides (called releasing and inhibi-
tory hormones or factors), have a very short response 
time to neurotransmitters (fractions of a second), and 
send axons into the neurohypophysis. In contrast, the 
effects of hormones derived from the epithelial cells 
of  the  anterior  hypophysis  have  a  longer  response 

time (minutes or hours) and can persist for as long 
as a day or even a month.

A pair of superior hypophyseal arteries (derived 
from the internal carotid arteries) (Figure 18-3) enter 
the median eminence and upper part of the infun-
dibular stem and form the ﬁrst sinusoidal capillary 
plexus  (primary  capillary  plexus),  which  receives 
the secretion of the neurosecretory cells grouped in 
the  hypothalamic  hypophysiotropic  nuclei  of  the 
hypothalamus.

Capillaries arising from the primary capillary plexus 
project down the infundibulum and pars tuberalis to 
form the portal veins. Capillaries arising from the

Immunohistochemistry (immunoperoxidase)
An antibody against the (cid:96) chain of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has been used 
to identify gonadotrophs within the anterior hypophysis in this illustration.
    The use of specific antibodies against hormones produced in the anterior 
hypophysis has enabled (1) the precise identification of all hormone-producing cells of 
the anterior hypophysis; (2) the identification of hormone-producing adenomas; and 
(3) the elucidation of the negative and positive feedback pathways regulating the 
secretion of hypophyseal hormones.

FSH-secreting cell (classified 
as basophil by H&E staining) 

portal veins form a secondary capillary plexus that 
supplies the anterior hypophysis and receives secre-
tions from endocrine cells of the anterior hypophy-
sis. There is no direct arterial blood supply to the 
anterior hypophysis. 

The  hypothalamohypophyseal  portal  system 

enables:

1. The  transport  of  hypothalamic  releasing  and 
inhibitory neuropeptides from the primary capillary 
plexus to the hormone-producing epithelial cells of 
the anterior hypophysis.

2. The secretion of  hormones from the anterior 

hypophysis  into the secondary capillary plexus and 
to the general circulation.

3. The functional integration of the hypothalamus 
with the anterior hypophysis, provided by the portal 
veins. 

A third capillary plexus, derived from the inferior 
hypophyseal  artery,  supplies  the  neurohypophysis. 
This  third  capillary  plexus  collects  secretions  from 
neurosecretory  cells  present  in  the    hypothalamus. 
The  secretory  products  (vasopressin  [antidiuretic 
hormone] and oxytocin) are transported along the 
axons into the neurohypophysis.

Light microscopy (plastic section)
Cells of the pars distalis are surrounded by sinusoids (fenestrated

transported in the bloodstream to regulate the function of target 
cells.

Electron microscopy
Electron microscopy has provided a powerful tool for examining the 
size, distribution, content, and mode of synthesis and 
secretion of the various hormones stored in secretory granules in 
the cytoplasm of endocrine cells of the anterior hypophysis. 

Histology of the pars distalis (anterior lobe)
The pars distalis is formed by three components: 

1. Cords of epithelial cells (Figure 18-4).
2. Minimal supporting connective tissue stroma.
3. Fenestrated capillaries (or sinusoids) (Figure 18-
5), which are parts of the secondary capillary plexus. 
There  is  no  blood-brain  barrier  in  the  anterior 

hypophysis.

The epithelial cells are arranged in cords surround-
ing fenestrated capillaries carrying blood from the 
hypothalamus. Secretory hormones diffuse into a net-
work of capillaries, which drain into the hypophyseal 
veins and from there into the dural venous sinuses.
There are three distinct types of endocrine cell in 

the anterior hypophysis (see Figure 18-4): 

1. Acidophils (cells that stain with an acidic dye), 

which are prevalent at the sides of the gland.

2. Basophils (cells that stain with a basic dye and 

are  periodic  acid–Schiff  [PAS]-positive),  which  are 
predominant in the middle of the gland.

3.  Chromophobes  (cells  lacking  cytoplasmic 

staining).  

Acidophils secrete two major peptide hormones: 

growth hormone and prolactin. 

Basophils  secrete  glycoprotein  hormones:  the 
gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 
luteinizing  hormone  (LH),  thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH), or corticotropin. Chromophobes include 
cells that have depleted their hormone content and 
lost  the  staining  afﬁnity  typical  of  acidophils  and 
basophils.

The precise identiﬁcation of the endocrine cells of 
the anterior hypophysis is by immunohistochemistry, 
which  demonstrates  their  hormone  content  using 
speciﬁc antibodies (see Figure 18-4).

Growth hormone induces growth through 
insulin-like growth factor–1 (IGF-1) produced 
by hepatocytes.
    GHRH stimulates the release of growth 
hormone from acidophils.
    Somatostatin and high blood glucose 
levels inhibit the release of growth hormone.
    IGF-1 stimulates the growth of long bones by 
stimulating the hypertrophy of chondrocytes at 
the epiphyseal plates.

Excess of growth hormone causes gigantism in 
children and acromegaly in adults. In most cases, 
an adenoma of the anterior hypophysis is 
responsible for growth hormone hypersecretion.
   A mutation in the gene encoding the aryl 
hydrocarbon–interacting protein predispose to 
adenoma formation.

Hormones secreted by acidophils: Growth hormone 
and prolactin
Acidophils  secrete  growth  hormone,  also  called 
somatotropin. These acidophilic cells, called somato-
trophs, represent a large proportion (40% to 50%) 
of  the  cell  population  of  the  anterior  hypophysis. 
Prolactin-secreting  cells,  or  lactotrophs,  represent 
15% to 20% of the cell population of the anterior 
hypophysis. 

Growth hormone
Growth hormone is a peptide of 191 amino acids in 
length  (22  kd).  It  has  the  following  characteristics 
(Figure 18-6): 

1. Growth hormone has structural homology simi-
lar to prolactin and human placental lactogen. There 
is some overlap in the activity of these three hormones. 
2. It is released into the blood circulation in the 
form of pulses throughout a 24-hour sleep-wake pe-
riod, with peak secretion occurring during the ﬁrst 
two hours of sleep.  

3.  Despite  its  name,  growth  hormone  does  not 
directly induce growth; rather, it acts by stimulating 
in hepatocytes the production of insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1), also known as somatomedin C. The 
cell receptor for IGF-1 is similar to that for insulin 
(formed by dimers of two glycoproteins with integral 
cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domains). 

4. The release of growth hormone is regulated by 

two neuropeptides.

  A  stimulatory  effect  is  determined  by  growth 
hormone–releasing  hormone  (GHRH),  a  peptide 
of 44 amino acids. An inhibitory effect is produced 
by somatostatin (a peptide of 14 amino acids) and 
by elevated blood glucose levels.  Both GHRH and 
somatostatin derive from the hypothalamus. Soma-
tostatin is also produced in the islet of Langerhans 
(pancreas).

IGF-1  (7.5  kd)  stimulates  the  overall  growth  of 
bone and soft tissues. In children, IGF-1 stimulates 
the  growth  of  long  bones  at  the  epiphyseal  plates. 
Clinicians  measure  IGF-1  in  blood  to  determine 
growth hormone function. A drop in IGF-1 serum 
levels stimulates the release of growth hormone.

IGF  target  cells  secrete  several  IGF-binding 
proteins and proteases. The latter can regulate the 
delivery and action of IGF on target cells by reducing 
available IGF-binding proteins.

Clinical  signiﬁcance:  Gigantism  (in  children)  and 
acromegaly (in adults)
Excessive secretion of growth hormone can occur in 
the presence of a benign tumor called an adenoma. 
When the growth hormone–secreting tumor occurs 
during childhood and puberty, at a time when the 
epiphyseal  plates  are  still  active,  gigantism  (Greek 
gigas,  giant;  extremely  tall  stature)  is  observed.  If 
excessive  growth  hormone  secretion  occurs  in  the 
adult, when the epiphyseal plates are inactive, acro-
megaly (Greek akron, end or extremity; megas, large)

Growth hormone

Prolactin stimulates lactation postpartum.
   The secretion of prolactin by acidophils is 
regulated primarily by inhibition rather than by 
stimulation.
    Dopamine is the main inhibitor of prolactin 
secretion.
    Suckling during lactation is the major stimulus 
of prolactin secretion. 
   

 A prolactin-secreting adenoma of the anterior 
hypophysis causes hyperprolactinemia, which in 
turn accounts for galactorrhea (nonpuerperal milk 
secretion).
    Hyperprolactinemia leads to reversible infertility 
in both females and males.

Lactation involves

progesterone, acting together with 
prolactin.

parturition by prolactin.
3. Galactopoiesis, stimulated by 
prolactin and oxytocin.

develops. In acromegaly, the hands, feet, jaw, and soft 
tissues become enlarged. Long bones do not grow in 
length, but cartilage (nose, ears) and membranous 
bones (mandible and calvarium) continue to grow, 
leading to gross deformities.

A growth hormone–secreting adenoma does not 
show  the  typical  pulsatile  secretory  pattern  of  the 
hormone. A decrease in the secretion of growth hor-
mone in children results in short stature (dwarﬁsm).

Prolactin
Prolactin  is  a  199-amino-acid  single-chain  protein 
(22  kd).  Prolactin,  growth  hormone,  and  human 
placental lactogen share some amino acid homology 
and overlapping activity,

The predominant action of prolactin is to stimulate 
the initiation and maintenance of lactation post par-
tum (Figure 18-7). Lactation involves the following: 
1. Mammogenesis, the growth and development 

Figure 18-8. Gonadotropins (FSH and LH)

Neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus 
secrete GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). 
GnRH is secreted in pulses at 60- to 90-minute 
intervals and stimulates the pulsatile secretion of 
gonadotropins by the basophilic gonadotrophs. 
    In the female, FSH stimulates granulosa cells of 
the ovarian follicle to proliferate and secrete estradiol, 
inhibin, and activin. LH stimulates progesterone 
secretion by the corpus luteum.
    In the male, FSH stimulates Sertoli cell function in 
the seminiferous epithelium (synthesis of inhibin, 
activin, and androgen-binding protein). LH 
stimulates the production of testosterone by Leydig 
cells. A lack of FSH and LH in females and males leads 
to infertility.
   Kallmann’s syndrome is characterized by delayed 
or absent puberty and anosmia (impaired sense of 
smell). It is clinically defined as hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism (HH). Mutations in genes prevent the 
migration of GnRH–secreting neurons to the 
hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and olfactory neurons to 
the olfactory bulb.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a tripeptide, modulates 
the synthesis and release of TSH (thyroid-stimulating 
hormone) from basophils.
    TSH is a glycoprotein that binds to a receptor in the plasma 
membrane of thyroid follicular epithelial cells. The 
hormone-receptor complex stimulates the formation of cAMP.  
The production of the thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) 
and T4 (thyroxine) is stimulated by cAMP.  
    Some T4 is converted to T3 in peripheral tissues. T3 is more 
active than T4 and has a negative feedback (inhibitory) action 
on TSH synthesis and release.

of the mammary gland, is stimulated primarily by 
estrogen  and  progesterone  in  coordination  with 
prolactin and human placental lactogen. 

2. Lactogenesis, the initiation of lactation, is trig-
gered by prolactin acting on the developed mammary 
gland by the actions of estrogens and progesterone. 
Lactation  is  inhibited  during  pregnancy  by  high  
levels of estrogen and progesterone, which decline 
at delivery. Either estradiol or prolactin antagonists 
are used clinically to stop lactation. 

3. Galactopoiesis, the maintenance of milk pro-

duction, requires both prolactin and oxytocin.

The effects of prolactin, placental lactogen, and 
steroids on the development of the lactating mam-
mary gland are discussed in Chapter 23, Fertilization, 
Placentation, and Lactation. 

Unlike other hormones of the anterior hypophysis, 
the secretion of prolactin is regulated primarily by 
inhibition  rather  than  by  stimulation. The  main 
inhibitor is dopamine. Dopamine secretion is stimu-
lated by prolactin to inhibit its own secretion.

A stimulatory effect on prolactin release is exerted 
by prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and thyrotro-
pin-releasing hormone (TRH). Prolactin is released 
from acidophils in a pulsatile fashion, coinciding with 
and following each period of suckling. Intermittent 
surges of prolactin stimulate milk synthesis.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hyperprolactinemia
Prolactin-secreting  tumors  alter  the  hypothalamo-
hypophysial-gonadal axis, leading to gonadotropin 
deﬁciency.  Hypersecretion  of  prolactin  in  women 
can be associated with infertility, caused by the lack 
of  ovulation  and  oligomenorrhea  or  amenorrhea 
(dysfunctional uterine bleeding). 

A  decrease  in  fertility  and  libido  is  found  in 

males. These antifertility effects are found in both 
genders  and  are  usually  reversible.  Galactorrhea
(nonpuerperal milk secretion) is a common problem 
in hyperprolactinemia and can also occur in males.

Hormones secreted by basophils: Gonadotropins, 
TSH, and ACTH
Gonadotropins (FSH and LH) and TSH have com-
mon features: 

1. They are glycoproteins (hence the PAS-positive 

staining of basophils).

2. They consist of two chains. The(cid:3)(cid:95) chain is a 
glycoprotein common to FSH, LH, and TSH, but 
the(cid:3)(cid:96) chain is speciﬁc for each hormone. Therefore, 
the (cid:96) chain confers speciﬁcity to the hormone.

Gonadotropins: Follicle-stimulating hormone and 
luteinizing hormone
Gonadotrophs (gonadotropin-secreting cells) (Figure 
18-8)  secrete  both  FSH  and  LH.  Gonadotrophs 
constitute about 10% of the total cell population of 
the anterior hypophysis.

The  release  of  gonadotropins  is  stimulated  by 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; also called 
luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone [LHRH]), 
a decapeptide produced in the arcuate nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. GnRH is secreted in pulses at 60- to 
90-minute intervals into the portal vasculature.  A 
single basophil can synthesize and release both FSH 
and LH in a pulsatile fashion.

In the female, FSH stimulates the development of 
the ovarian follicles by a process called folliculogen-
esis.  In the male, FSH acts on Sertoli cells in the 
testes to stimulate the aromatization of estrogens from 
androgens and the production of androgen-binding 
protein, with binding afﬁnity to testosterone.

N-terminal peptide, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and 
(cid:96)-lipotrophic hormone ((cid:96)-LPH) are produced in the anterior 
hypophysis.
    The cleavage products of (cid:96)-LPH ((cid:97)-LPH and (cid:96)-endorphin) are 
released into the circulation and may have a functional role in 
humans.
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:96)-LPH and (cid:97)-LPH are lipolytic hormones and their role in fat 
mobilization in humans is not known.
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:97)-LPH gives rise to (cid:96)-melanocyte–stimulating hormone ((cid:96)-MSH). 

(cid:96)-Endorphin contains the sequences of met-enkephalin (met-enk). 
There is no evidence that (cid:96)-endorphin is cleaved in the hypophysis 
to form met-enk. (cid:96)-MSH is not secreted in humans.
    ACTH is cleaved to (cid:95)-melanocyte–stimulating hormone  
((cid:95)-MSH) and CLIP only in species with a prominent pars 
intermedia. (cid:95)-MSH and (cid:96)-MSH determine the dispersion of 
melanin granules in melanophores of fish, reptiles, and amphibians 
to darken the skin.  The human hypophysis lacks a prominent pars 
intermedia (except during fetal development), and the processing 
of ACTH to (cid:95)-MSH and CLIP (unknown function) does not occur.

In the female, LH stimulates steroidogenesis in the 
ovarian follicle and corpus luteum. In the male, LH 
controls the rate of testosterone synthesis by Leydig 
cells in the testis. The function of FSH and LH in 
the male is analyzed in Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis. 

The release of FSH and GnRH is inhibited by:
1. Inhibin, a heterodimer protein formed by (cid:95)- 
and(cid:3)(cid:96)-peptide chains, secreted by the male and female 
target cells (Sertoli cells and granulosa cells and cells 
of the anterior hypophysis).

2. Estradiol. 
The release of FSH in both females and males is 
enhanced by a homodimer protein, called activin, 
secreted by Sertoli cells and granulosa cells. It consists 
of two (cid:96) chains. Little is known about what controls  
(cid:95)(cid:96) (inhibin) and (cid:96)(cid:96) (activin) dimerization. 

Kallmann’s syndrome is characterized by delayed 
or absent puberty and anosmia (impaired sense of 
smell). It is determined by mutations in genes whose 
encoded proteins are responsible for the migration 
and  survival  of  GnRH–secreting  neurons  to  the 
hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and olfactory neurons 
to the olfactory bulb.

This condition affects the production of FSH and 
LH, two gonadotropins that regulate male and female 
sexual development at puberty. It is clinically deﬁned 

as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). 

We discuss in Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis, and 
Chapter  22,  Follicle  Development  and The  Men-
strual Cycle, the functions of FSH and LH in sper-
matogenesis, Leydig cell function, folliculogenesis, 
and  luteogenesis.  Additional  molecular  aspects  of 
Kallmann’s syndrome are discussed in Chapter 22.

  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Infertility
The secretion of FSH and LH can decrease when 
there  is  a  deﬁcient  secretion  of  GnRH,  caused  by 
anorexia or a tumor of the hypophysis, which can 
destroy  the  gonadotrops,  thereby  decreasing  FSH 
and LH secretion.

A decrease in fertility and reproductive functions 
can be observed in females and males. Females can 
have menstrual disorders. Small testes and infertility 
can be seen in males (a condition known as hypogo-
nadotropic hypogonadism) when GnRH secretion 
is deﬁcient. 

Castration (ovariectomy in the female and orchi-
dectomy in the male) causes a signiﬁcant increase in 
the synthesis of FSH and LH as a result of a loss of 
feedback inhibition. Hyperfunctional gonadotropic 
cells are large and vacuolated and are called castra-
tion cells.

Figure 18-11. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)

ACTH controls predominantly the function of two 
zones of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata and 
zona reticularis).  The zona glomerulosa is  
regulated by angiotensin II derived from the 
processing of the liver protein angiotensinogen by 
the proteolytic action of renin (kidneys) and 
converting enzyme (lungs).
    ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol (a 
glucocorticoid) and androgens. Cortisol and other 
steroids are metabolized in liver.
   Low levels of cortisol in blood, stress, and 
vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) stimulate 
ACTH secretion from basophils by stimulation of 
CRH release (positive feedback). Cortisol is the 
dominating regulatory factor.
    

   ACTH increases the pigmentation of skin. Skin 
darkening in Addison's disease and Cushing's 
disease is not determined by melanocyte- 
stimulating hormone (MSH), which is not normally 
present in human serum.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) 
Thyrotropic  cells  represent  about  5%  of  the  total 
population of the anterior hypophysis.

TSH is the regulatory hormone of thyroid func-
tion (Figure 18-9) and growth. The mechanism of 
action of TSH on thyroid cell function is discussed 
in the thyroid gland section of Chapter 19, Endo-
crine System. 

Thyrotropin-releasing  hormone  (TRH),  a 
3-amino-acid-peptide  produced  in  the  hypothala-
mus,  stimulates  the  synthesis  and  release  of TSH 
from  basophils. TRH  also  stimulates  the  release 
of  prolactin. The  release  of TSH  is  inhibited  by 
increased  concentrations  of  the  thyroid  hormones 
triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).  

  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hypothyroidism
A deﬁciency in the secretion of TSH (observed in 
rare cases of congenital hypoplasia of the hypophysis) 
produces hypothyroidism, characterized by reduced 
cell metabolism and temperature and basal metabolic 
rate  and  mental  lethargy.  Hypothyroidism  is  also 
observed in the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s 
disease. Hypothyroidism can also result from a dis-
ease of the thyroid gland or a deﬁciency in dietary 
iodine. We discuss hyperthyroidism in the thyroid 
gland section of Chapter 19, Endocrine System when 
describing Graves’ disease.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone
ACTH, or corticotropin, is a single-chain protein, 
39 amino acids in length (4.5 kd), with a short cir-
culating time (7 to 12 minutes). Its primary action 
is to stimulate growth and steroid synthesis in the 
zonae fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex. 
The zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex is under 
the control of  angiotensin II (see the adrenal gland 
section of Chapter 19, Endocrine System). 

The effects of ACTH on the adrenal cortex are me-
diated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). 
ACTH also acts beyond the adrenal gland by increas-
ing skin pigmentation and lipolysis.

ACTH derives from a large glycosylated precursor 
of  31  kd  called  pro-opiomelanocortin  (POMC), 
processed in the anterior hypophysis. The products 
of POMC are the following (Figure 18-10): 

1. An N-terminal peptide of unknown function,
ACTH, and (cid:96)-lipotrophic hormone ((cid:96)-LPH). These 
three POMC derivatives are secreted by the anterior 
hypophysis.

2. The cleavage products of (cid:96)-LPH, (cid:97)-LPH, and
(cid:96)-endorphin  are  released  into  circulation.  (cid:96)-LPH 
and (cid:97)-lipotrophic hormone ((cid:97)-LPH)  have  lipolytic 
action, but their precise role in fat mobilization in 
humans is unknown.

The hormones antidiuretic hormone (or 
arginine vasopressin) and oxytocin are 
synthesized in the neurons of the 
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, 
respectively.     
   The hormones are transported along the 
axons forming the hypothalamic 
hypophyseal tract, together with the 
carrier protein neurophysin, and are 
released at the axon terminals. The 
hormones enter fenestrated capillaries 
derived from the inferior hypophyseal 
artery.

sequences  of  met-enkephalin  (met-enk). There  is 
no evidence that (cid:96)-endorphin is cleaved in the hy-
pophysis to form met-enk.

4. ACTH is cleaved to (cid:95)-melanocyte–stimulating 
hormone ((cid:95)-MSH) and corticotropin-like interme-
diate peptide (CLIP). (cid:95)-MSH and CLIP hormones, 
found in species with a hypophysis with a prominent 
pars intermedia, cause dispersion of melanin granules 
in melanophores and darkening of the skin of many 
ﬁsh, amphibians, and reptiles.

The release of ACTH is controlled by the following 

(Figure 18-11):

1.  A stimulatory effect determined by corticotro-
pin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothala-
mus. CRH co-localizes with antidiuretic hormone 
(ADH;  see  later  section,  Neurohypophysis)  in  the 

paraventricular nuclei. Both ADH and angiotensin II 
potentiate the effect of CRH on the release of ACTH.
2.  An  inhibitory  effect  caused  by  high  levels  of 
cortisol in blood either by preventing the release of 
CRH or by blocking the release of ACTH by basophil 
corticotropic cells (ACTH-secreting cells). 

ACTH is secreted in a circadian manner (morning 

peaks followed by a slow decline afterward).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Cushing’s disease
An  ACTH-secreting  adenoma  of  the  hypophysis 
causes Cushing’s disease. This disease is characterized 
by an increase in the production of cortisol by the

obesity,  osteoporosis, and muscle wasting. A reduc-
tion in the secretion of ACTH results in diminished

A loss of ACTH decreases adrenal androgen secre-
tion. In females, androgen deﬁciency causes loss of 
pubic and axillary hair. This effect is not observed in 
males because it is compensated for by the testicular 
secretion of androgens.

Neurohypophysis
The  neurohypophysis  consists  of  three  histologic 
components (Figures 18-12 and 18-13): 

1. Pituicytes, resembling  astrocytes, provide sup-

port to the axons. 

2.  Unmyelinated  axons,  derived  from  neuroen-
docrine cells called magnicellular neurons (because 
their  cell  bodies  are  large).  Axons  have  Herring 
bodies, bulging intermittent segments and terminals 
containing  secretory  products,  the  neurophysin-
hormone complex.

Neurophysin is a protein of 10 kd containing 90 
to  97  amino  acids  derived  by  cleavage  from  pre-

prooxiphysin. It is transported, stored, and secreted 
bound to the hormone. Neurophysin does not have 
an apparent biologic action other than serving as a 
hormone carrier during axonal transport. 

3.  Fenestrated  capillaries  are  derived  from  the 

inferior hypophyseal artery.

Pituicytes are astrocyte-like glial cells with abun-
dant glial ﬁbrillary acidic proteins, an intermediate 
ﬁlament  protein,  and  a  few  lipid  droplets  in  their 
cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic processes of pituicytes

Oxytocin acts on uterine contraction 
and milk release during suckling.
    Estrogens increase the response of 
the myometrium to oxytocin; 
progesterone decreases the response. 
    During lactation, oxytocin release is 
mediated by a neurohumoral reflex 
triggered by suckling. Suckling 
activates sensory receptors in the 
nipple and areola. Sensory fibers are 
linked to the hypothalamic neurons 
producing oxytocin. When the stimulus 
arrives, an action potential transmitted 
along the axons of the paraventricular 
neurons extending into the pars 
nervosa causes the release of 
oxytocin into the blood.

Figure 18-15. Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) and oxytocin

Arginine vasopressin and oxytocin have similar molecular 
structures. Each consists of nine amino acids arranged as a ring 
formed by the linkage of two molecules of cysteine (a disulfide 
linkage) and a short side chain.  The structure of the two 
hormones differs only at amino acids 3 and 8. There are two 
forms of vasopressin: arginine vasopressin has arginine at 
position 8; lysine vasopressin has lysine at position 8.

Antidiuretic hormone increases the permeability of 
the collecting tubule to water and also has an 
arteriolar vasoconstrictive action (hence the 
alternative name vasopressin).  The action of 
antidiuretic hormone is mediated by cAMP, which 
stimulates membrane channels to increase the diffusion 
of water. Consequently, urine flow decreases.

Some  neurons  of  the  paraventricular  nuclei  are 
small and their axons project to the median eminence 
rather than to the pars nervosa. These neurons, called 
parvicellular neurons (Latin parvus, small), secrete ar-
ginine vasopressin (ADH) and oxytocin entering the 
hypophyseal portal blood at the median eminence.
  Large  neurons  of  the  supraoptic  and  paraven-
tricular nuclei, called magnicellular neurons (Latin 
magnus, large), give rise to axons forming the hypo-
thalamic hypophyseal tract. The terminals of these 
neurons are located in the pars nervosa. 

In  general,  neurons  of  the  supraoptic  and  para-
ventricular  nuclei  synthesize  vasopressin  and  oxy-
tocin.  However, neurons  of  the  supraoptic  nuclei 
produce primarily vasopressin and neurons of the 
paraventricular nuclei synthesize primarily oxytocin. 
Neurophysin I is a carrier for oxytocin; neurophysin 
II is a carrier for vasopressin.

Vasopressin and oxytocin are transported down 
the  axons  and  stored  in  nerve  terminals  within 

secretory granules, packaged together with neuro-
physin. The released hormones circulate in blood in 
an unbound form and have a half-life of 5 minutes. 
In addition to these two nuclei, the hypothalamus 
has additional nuclei, the hypothalamic hypophy-
siotropic nuclei, with neurons producing releasing 
and inhibitory hormones to be discharged at the fe-
nestrated capillaries of the primary plexus (see earlier, 
Blood supply of the hypophysis). 

Although the neuroendocrine cells of the supraop-
tic and paraventricular nuclei are located behind the 
blood-brain barrier, their products are transported to 
nerve terminals and released outside the blood-brain 
barrier into fenestrated capillaries.

Melatonin

Melatonin is secreted into the general circulation after exposure to darkness and is 
stopped upon exposure to light. 
    Melatonin acts on both the hypothalamus and anterior hypophysis to inhibit 
gonadotropin and growth hormone secretion. 
    Tumors of the pineal gland are associated with precocious puberty.

milk ejection (or letdown of milk) during lactation 
(Figure 18-15).

Antidiuretic hormone regulates water excretion 
in the kidneys and is also a potent vasoconstrictor 
at high doses (see Figure 18-15). This is the basis for 
its alternative name, vasopressin (arginine vasopres-
sin [AVP]).  

An  increase  in  osmotic  pressure  in  circulating 
blood or reduced blood volume triggers the release 
of ADH. Retention of water reduces plasma osmo-
lality, which acts on hypothalamic osmoreceptors to 
suppress the secretion of ADH.

Neurogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the 
secretion of ADH is reduced or absent. Polyuria is 
a  common  clinical  ﬁnding.  Patients  with  diabetes 
insipidus can excrete up to 20 L of urine in 24 hours. 
Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a head 
injury, an invasive tumor damaging the hypothalamic 
hypophyseal system, or autoimmune destruction of 
vasopressin-secreting neurons.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs in certain 
chronic  renal  diseases  that  are  nonresponsive  to 
vasopressin or as a result of genetic defects in renal 
receptors for vasopressin.

Pineal gland
The pineal gland, or epiphysis, is an endocrine organ 
formed by cells with a neurosecretory function.  It  lies 
in the center of the brain, behind the third ventricle  
and is connected to the brain by a stalk. 

There are no direct nerve connections of the pi-
neal gland with the brain. Instead, postganglionic 
sympathetic nerve ﬁbers derived from the superior 
cervical ganglia supply the pineal gland. 

Preganglionic ﬁbers to the superior cervical gan-
glia  derive  from  the  lateral  column  of  the  spinal 
cord. The function of the pineal gland is regulated 
by sympathetic nerves. 

In brief,, the mammalian pineal gland is a neuro-
endocrine transducer handling photic information 
sent from the retina.

Development of the pineal gland
    The pineal gland develops from a saccular outpock-
eting of the posterior diencephalic roof in the midline 
of the third ventricle (Figure 18-16). 

Continued diverticulation and infolding result in a 
solid parenchymal mass of cords and clusters of pine-
alocytes and glial-like interstitial cells supported by 

Pineal gland

a meninges-derived connective tissue (pia mater) that 
carries blood vessels and nerves to the pineal gland.

Histology of the pineal gland 
In ﬁshes and amphibians, the pineal gland is a neu-
rosensory photoreceptor organ. In reptiles and birds, 
the  photosensory  function  has  been  replaced  by  a 
secretory function. In mammals, the pineal gland has 
a neurotransmitter secretory function. 

The pineal gland is a highly vascular gland consist-

ing of two cell types (see Figure 18-16): 

1. The pinealocytes.
2. The glial-like interstitial cells.
The  pinealocytes  are  neuroepithelial  secretory 
cells organized into cords and clusters resting on a 
basal  lamina  and  surrounded  by  connective  tissue, 
blood vessels lined by fenestrated endothelial cells, 
and  nerves. The  pinealocyte  lacks  an  axon;  it  has 
two or more cell processes ending in bulbous expan-
sions. One of the processes ends near a capillary. The 
cytoplasm contains abundant mitochondria and ran-
domly distributed multiple synaptic ribbons (Figure 
18-17). In contrast, single ribbon synapses can be 
seen at the synaptic end of sensory cells of the retina 
(see Figure 9-18) and inner ear (see Figure 9-28). 

Pinealocytes can be identiﬁed using antibodies to 
synaptophysin, a cell membrane glycoprotein marker 
of neurosecretory cells, as well as tumors arising from 
these cells.  

Interstitial  cells  are  found  among  pinealocytes. 
The glial-like interstitial cells, identiﬁed by the pres-
ence of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the 
cytoplasm, and the connective tissue provide stromal 
support to the functional pinealocytes.

The neural input to the pineal gland is norepineph-
rine, and the output is melatonin. The function of 
pinealocytes is regulated by (cid:96)-adrenergic receptors. 
The metabolic activity of pinealocytes is inhibited by 
(cid:96)-adrenergic antagonists.

An  important  feature  of  the  pineal  gland  is  the 
presence  of  deﬁned  areas  of  calciﬁcation,  called 
corpora arenacea (brain sand). Pinealocytes secrete 
an extracellular matrix  in which hydroxyl or carbon-
ate apatite crystals deposit (see Figure 18-16). They 
develop from early infancy, increase with age and are 
radiologically visible after the second decade of life. 
Calciﬁcation has no known effect on the function 
of the pineal gland. A calciﬁed pineal gland is an 
important  radiographic  marker  of  the  midline  of 
the brain. 

Pinealocytes secrete melatonin 
Melatonin is the major biologically active substance 
secreted by the pineal gland. The synthesis and re-
lease  of  melatonin  are  stimulated  by  darkness  and 
inhibited by light. 

During daylight hours, the retinal photoreceptor 
cells are hyperpolarized and the release of norepineph-
rine is inhibited. Consequently, the retinohypotha-
lamic–pineal  system  is  resting  and  little  melatonin 
is secreted.

When darkness starts, the photoreceptors release 
norepinephrine, that activates (cid:95)1- and (cid:96)1-adrenergic 
receptors in the pinealocytes to increase their mela-
tonin synthetic activity. 

Melatonin  is  rapidly  metabolized,  mainly  in  the 
liver, by hydroxylation to 6-hydroxymelatonin and, 
after conjugation with sulfuric or glucuronic acid, is 
excreted in the urine.

In summary, light has two effects on melatonin:
1. Day–night light cycles modify the rhythm of 

melatonin secretion.

2. Brief pulses of light of sufﬁcient intensity and 
duration  can  rapidly  suppress  the  production  of 
melatonin.  

Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan and im-
mediately secreted (Figure 18-18). Serotonin, a neu-
rotransmitter, is a precursor of melatonin. Serotonin is 
acetylated and then methylated to produce melatonin. 
Serotonin  N-acetyltransferase  is  the  rate-limiting 
enzyme  in  melatonin  synthesis.  In  fact,  exposure 
to light or administration of (cid:96)-adrenergic blocking 
agents causes a rapid decrease in N-acetyltransferase 
and a consequent decline in melatonin synthesis.

During night, with complete darkness, the melato-

nin content of the pineal gland is highest. 

Melatonin is released by passive diffusion into the 

general circulation:

1. To act on the hypothalamus and hypophysis, 
and, in many species, to inhibit gonadotropin and 
growth hormone secretion.

2. To  induce  sleepiness.  Melatonin  integrates 
photoperiods and modulate circadian rhythms. An 
unproved  hypothesis  is  that  melatonin  contributes 
to drowsiness when lights are turned down.

Two  melatonin  G  protein-coupled  cell  surface 
receptors, designated Mel1A and Mel1B, are differ-
entially expressed in different tissues and account for 
the varying biologic effects of melatonin.

Light is a regulator of circadian rhythms
The  circadian  rhythm  of  melatonin  secretion  is  of 
endogenous origin; signals originate in the suprachi-
asmatic nucleus. A 24-hour biologic circadian (Latin 
circa, about; dies, day) clock regulates sleep and alert 
patterns and is linked to the periodic light-dark cycle 
or sleep-wake cycle.

We previously indicated that the mammalian pi-
neal gland is a neuroendocrine transducer handling 
information sent from the retina.
The retina has two functions:
1. The detection of light for the formation of images 

576

    18.  NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Pineal gland

by  transforming  photon  energy  into  an  electrical 
signal, as we discuss in Chapter  9, Sensory Organs.
2.  Non-image  forming  (NIF)  visual  functions 
required for adjusting the internal circadian clock to 
light and sleep. NIF visual functions involve a subset 
of retinal ganglion cells

   The  retinohypothalamic  tract  conducts  light 
signals to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus  
(the central circadian pacemaker) as the initial step in 
the regulation of melatonin synthesis and secretion by 
the way of a polysynaptic pathway (see Figure 18-18).
The  suprachiasmatic  nucleus  (SCN)  is  located 
adjacent to the optic chiasm and contains a network 
of neurons operating as an endogenous pacemaker 
regulating  circadian  rhythmicity.  Neurons  that 
contain  melatonin    Mel1A  and  Mel1B  receptors 
are  circadian  oscillators  connected  to  specialized 
melanopsin-producing ganglion cells of the retina.  
Cells with NIF visual functions are called intrinsi-
cally photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).
The  ipRGCs  function  as  luminance  detectors 
resetting  the  circadian  oscillators. There  is  some 
evidence  that  the  SCN  sends  signals  to  the  circa-
dian  pacemakers  of  the  rest  of  the  body  through 
the  proteins  transforming  growth  factor-(cid:95)  and 
prokineticin 2. 

When a SCN is transplanted to a recipient with 
a damaged suprachiasmatic nucleus, it displays the 
circadian pacemaker properties of the donor rather 
than those of the host. This indicates that ipRGCs 
and the SCN, in addition to its circadian pacemaker 
function, project to several regions of the brain to 
drive rhythms involved in inducing sleep or inﬂu-
ence mood. 

Patients  with  depression  report  sleep  alteration 
weeks before the reappearance of depression symp-
toms. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of 
depression related to the shorter day length of the 
winter months. SAD has been observed in patients 
with bipolar disorders, characterized by a signiﬁcant 
switch in mood between periods of mania and de-
pression. 

Jet lag, a condition associated with fatigue, insom-
nia, and disorientation experienced by many travelers 
ﬂying across time zones, is caused by a temporary 
disruption  of  the  circadian  rhythm  by  shifting  or 
dissociation of the light-dark/sleep-wake cycles. 

Resetting of the circadian clock, caused by a tempo-

rary lack of alignment between the circadian rhythm 
and local time, involves appropriate timed exposure to 
light and/or the administration of melatonin. 

Together,  these  observations  indicate  that  the 
synchronization of the circadian system impacts on 
mental health issues.

Pathology: Pineocytomas

A tumor of the pineal gland, called pineocytoma, 
causes compression symptoms, invades local struc-
tures or disseminates beyond the tumor site. 

About 10 percent of lesions of the pineal gland are 
essentially benign, including pineal cysts. Another 10 
percent of tumors are relatively benign, including low-
grade gliomas. The remaining 80 percent of pineal 
region neoplasms are highly malignant lesions. These 
include germ cell tumors (pineal germinoma), em-
bryonal carcinoma  and malignant pineoblastoma. 
Germinomas  derive  from  primordial  germ  cells 
(PGCs) that originate from yolk-sac endoderm and 
migrate to the gonadal ridges of the embryo. A lack 
of normal involution of PGCs at any migratory site 
(see Chapter 21, Sperm Transport and Maturation) 
can develop into a germinoma. 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides tumor  
and anatomic details (cystic, calciﬁed, extension into 
the lateral ventricles or the suprasellar region).

 The extent and nature of the tumor can be assessed 
by cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid 
(to determine the presence of malignant cells) and 
determination of (cid:95)-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker of a 
germ cell tumor.  Ophthalmologic examination is re-
quired to determine the regional extent of the tumor.
Precocious  puberty  or  delayed  onset  of  sexual 
maturation  is  seen  in  about  10  percent  of  male 
patients  with  pineal  tumors.  Precocious  puberty  is 
characterized by the onset of androgen secretion and 
spermatogenesis in boys  before the age of 9 or 10 
years and the initiation of estrogen secretion and cyclic 
ovarian activity in girls before age 8. 

Precocious puberty is probably caused by the effect 
of the tumor on the function of the hypothalamus 
rather  than  by  a  direct  effect  of  pineal  tumors  on 
sexual function.

Pineocytomas cause a neurologic disorder known 
as  Parinaud’s  syndrome  (paralysis  of  upward  gaze, 
looking steadily in one direction, pupillary areﬂexia to 
light, paralysis of convergence, and wide-based gait).

Neuroendocrine System

• General organization of the neuroendocrine 
system. The hypothalamus and the hypophysis 
(pituitary gland) form an integrated system 
known as the hypothalamohypophyseal sys-
tem consisting of two components: 
  (1) The hypothalamic adenohypophyseal 
system (linking the hypothalamus to the ante-
rior hypophysis).
  (2) The hypothalamic neurohypophyseal 
system (connecting the hypothalamus to the 
neurohypophysis).

• Functional aspects of the neuroendocrine 
system. The hypothalamus contains clusters 
of neurons called nuclei. Some of the 
neurons are neuroendocrine cells exerting 
positive and negative effects on the two 
components of the hypophysis. These effects 
are mediated by releasing and inhibitory 
hormones or factors. 

The transport of signaling molecules is medi-

ated by the hypothalamohypophyseal portal 
circulation consisting of: 

(1) A primary capillary plexus in the lower 

hypothalamus.

(2) The primary capillary plexus is connected 
by portal veins to a secondary capillary plexus 
in the anterior lobe of the hypophysis. 

(3) A third capillary plexus supplies the 

neurohypophysis. 

  The primary capillary plexus is supplied by 
the superior hypophyseal artery; the third 
capillary plexus is supplied by the inferior 
hypophyseal artery. The two arteries are con-
nected by the trabecular artery. There is no 
connection between the secondary and third 
capillary plexuses. The hypophyseal vein drains 
the second and third capillary plexuses to the 
dural sinuses.

• The hypophysis consists of two embryologi-
cally distinct portions: 
  (1) The adenohypophysis or glandular 
component, derived from Rathke’s pouch, 
an invagination of the roof of the future oral 
cavity.
  (2) The neurohypophysis or neural compo-
nent, an infundibular downgrowth from the 
ﬂoor of the diencephalon.

The adenohypophysis consists of three 

subdivisions: 

(1) The pars distalis (anterior lobe).
(2) The pars tuberalis, surrounding the neural 

infundibular stem or stalk.

(3) The pars intermedia (the rudimentary 

intermediate lobe). 

The neurohypophysis consists of two subdivi-

sions: 

(1) The pars nervosa.
(2) The median eminence.

The anterior lobe contains three compo-

nents: 

(1) Epithelial cell cords.
(2) A connective tissue stroma.
(3) Fenestrated capillaries (sinusoids) of the 

secondary capillary plexus.

There are three distinct cell populations:
(1) Acidophil cells, stain with an acidic dye.
(2) Basophil cells, stain with a basic dye.
(3) Chromophobe cells, lacking cytoplasmic 

staining). 

Acidophil cells secrete peptide hormones 
(growth hormone and prolactin); basophils 
secrete glycoprotein hormones (gonadotro-
pins FSH and LH, TSH, and ACTH). Chromo-
phobe cells are cells that have depleted their 
cytoplasmic hormonal content.

• Growth hormone (also called somatotro-
pin). It is secreted in a pulsatile pattern with 
peak secretion occurring during the ﬁrst 2 
hours of sleep. Growth hormone exerts its 
actions through insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) produced in hepatocytes after stimula-
tion by growth hormone. 

The release of growth hormone is stimu-

lated by growth hormone–releasing hormone 
produced in the hypothalamus and by high 
blood levels of IGF-1. Inhibition of growth 
hormone release is mediated by somatostatin

(also produced in the hypothalamus and in 
the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas) and 
high blood levels of glucose.
  Gigantism during childhood and puberty is 
caused by excessive secretion of growth hor-
mone (usually produced by a benign tumor of 
the hypophysis called adenoma). Acromegaly 
(enlargement of hands, feet, jaw, and soft tis-
sues) is seen in adults when growth hormone 
production is high.

• Prolactin has a main function: to stimulate 
the initiation and maintenance of lactation 
postpartum. Lactation involves:
  (1) Mammogenesis, the growth and devel-
opment of the mammary glands.
  (2) Lactogenesis, the initiation of lactation.
  (3) Galactopoiesis, the maintenance of milk 
production. 
  A secondary function is to facilitate the 
steroidogenic action of LH in Leydig cells by 
up-regulating the expression of the luteinizing 
hormone (LH) receptor. The pulsatile secretion 
of prolactin is regulated primarily by an inhibi-
tory mechanism rather than by stimulation. 
The main inhibitor is dopamine.  
  Prolactin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-
releasing hormone, both originating in the 
hypothalamus, stimulate prolactin release. 
  Excessive secretion of prolactin (hyperprolac-
tinemia) by a benign tumor of the hypophysis 
in both genders causes gonadotropin deﬁcien-
cy. In women, hyperprolactinemia is associated 
with infertility, anovulation, and oligomenor-
rhea or amenorrhea (dysfunctional uterine 
bleeding). A decrease in fertility and libido is 
seen in males. Galactorrhea (nonpuerperal 
milk secretion) caused by hyperprolactinemia 
is common in both genders. 

• Gonadotropins: FSH and LH. The release 
of gonadotropins is stimulated by gonado-
tropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; also called 
luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone or 
LHRH). GnRH is secreted in pulses at 60- to 
90-minute intervals. A single basophil cell can 
produce both FSH and LH. 

In the female, FSH stimulates folliculogenesis 

(the development of the ovarian follicle). 

In the male, FSH targets Sertoli cells in the 
testes to convert testosterone into estrogen 
(by aromatization) and produce androgen-
binding protein (ABP).

In the female, LH stimulates steroidogenesis 

in the ovarian follicle and corpus luteum. In 
the male, LH controls the production of testos-
terone by Leydig cells.

The release of FSH and GnRH is inhibited by 
inhibin (an (cid:95)(cid:96) heterodimer) produced by the 
target cells (follicular cells and Sertoli cells), 
and estradiol. The release of FSH is enhanced 
by activin (a (cid:96)(cid:96) homodimer).
A drop in the secretion of GnRH, caused by 
anorexia nervosa, a tumor of the hypophysis, 
or a condition known as hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism (HH), can abolish the secre-
tion of FSH and LH. Castration (ovariectomy 
or orchidectomy) causes a signiﬁcant increase 
in the synthesis of FSH and LH and the 
vacuolization of gonadotropin-secreting cells 
(castration cells).

   Kallmann’s syndrome consists in delayed or 
absent puberty and anosmia (impaired sense 
of smell). It is determined by mutations in 
genes whose encoded proteins are respon-
sible for the migration of GnRH–secreting 
neurons to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus 
and olfactory neurons to the olfactory bulb.
 
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; or thy-
rotropin) regulates thyroid function. Thyrotro-
pin-releasing hormone stimulates the release 
of TSH (and prolactin). Thyroid hormones 
triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) inhibit 
the release of TSH.
  Hypothyroidism, characterized by reduced 
cell metabolism and temperature, is caused 
by deﬁcient secretion of TSH and by the 
autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s disease.
Hyperthyroidism is usually determined by an 
autoantibody directed against the TSH receptor 
in thyroid follicular cells (Graves’ disease).

• Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; or 
corticotropin) stimulates growth and steroid 
synthesis in the zona fasciculata and zona 
reticularis of the adrenal cortex.

ACTH derives from the large precursor pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC) processed in the 
anterior hypophysis. 

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) 

derived from neuroendocrine neurons of the 
paraventricular nuclei, which also produce 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH), stimulates the 
release of ACTH. This CRH stimulatory effect 
is potentiated by ADH and angiotensin II       
(ANGII). High levels of cortisol prevent the 
release of CRH or ACTH.
  Cushing’s disease, caused by an ACTH-
producing adenoma of the hypophysis, results 
in the overproduction of cortisol by cells of the 
zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, obesity, 
osteoporosis, and muscle wasting.

• Neurohypophysis. Three histologic compo-
nents form the neurohypophysis: 
  (1) Pituicytes, astrocyte-like cells containing 
the intermediate ﬁlament protein glial ﬁbrillary 
acidic protein and providing support to axons.
  (2) Unmyelinated axons derived from 
neuroendocrine cells of the hypothalamic 
supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei forming 
the hypothalamic hypophyseal tract.
  (3) Fenestrated capillaries. 

Axons display intermittent bulging segments 

called Herring bodies containing neuroendo-
crine secretory granules. 

Each secretory granule consists of two 

components: the carrier protein neurophysin 
and the associated hormone ADH (also called 
arginine vasopressin) or oxytocin.

Oxytocin participates in the contraction of 
uterine smooth muscle during labor, and of 
myoepithelial cells in the lactating mammary 
alveoli to facilitate milk ejection. ADH regulates 
water excretion in the kidneys and, at a higher 
concentration, is also a potent vasoconstrictor.

Neurogenic diabetes insipidus occurs 

when the secretion of ADH is reduced. It is 
caused by severe head injury, an invasive 
tumor disrupting the hypothalamic hypophysial 
tract, or the autoimmune destruction of ADH-

producing neurons. Polyuria is a common 
clinical ﬁnding. 

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs 

in certain chronic renal diseases that are not 
responsive to ADH. 

• Pineal gland. The pineal gland is an 
endocrine organ consisting of cells with a 
neurosecretory function and without direct 
nerve connection with the brain. 
  The pineal gland is supplied by postgangli-
onic sympathetic nerve ﬁbers derived from 
the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Pregangli-
onic ﬁbers to the SCG derive from the lateral 
column of the spinal cord.  

The pineal gland develops from a saccular 

outpocketing of the posterior diencephalic 
roof in the midline of the third ventricle. It 
contains cells called pinealocytes, arranged in 
cords and clusters, and supporting glial-like 
interstitial cells. 

The pinealocyte displays cytoplasmic 

extensions with bulbar endings. These cell 
processes end close to a capillary. Pinealo-
cytes contain abundant mitochondria and 
characteristic multiple ribbon synapses. 

Remember that ribbon synapses are also 

seen in photoreceptor cells of the retina and 
in hair cells of the inner ear.

An important landmark of the pineal gland 
are calciﬁed deposits called corpora arenacea 
(“brain sand”).

Functional aspects of the pineal gland. The 
pineal gland can be regarded as a neuroen-
docrine transducer collecting information sent 
from the retina.

During daylight hours, the retinal pho-
toreceptor cells are hyperpolarized and 
the release of norepinephrine is inhibited. 
Consequently, the retinohypothalamic–pi-
neal system is resting and little melatonin is 
secreted.

When darkness starts, the photoreceptors 
release norepinephrine, that activates (cid:95)1- and 
(cid:96)1-adrenergic receptors in the pinealocytes to 
increase their melatonin synthetic activity. 

The neural input to the pineal gland is 

norepinephrine, and the output is melatonin. 
The function of pinealocytes is regulated by 
(cid:96)-adrenergic receptors. The metabolic activity 
of pinealocytes is inhibited by (cid:96)-adrenergic 
antagonists.

Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan 

and immediately secreted into the blood-
stream. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is a 
precursor of melatonin. Serotonin is acetylated 
and then methylated to produce melatonin.
 Serotonin N-acetyltransferase is the rate-
limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis. In 
fact, exposure to light or administration of 
(cid:96)-adrenergic blocking agents causes a rapid 
decrease in N-acetyltransferase and a conse-
quent decline in melatonin synthesis.

 The retinohypothalamic tract conducts 
light signals from the retina, in particular 
from melanopsin-producing ganglion cells 
that function as luminance detectors, to the 
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), 
regarded as the circadian clock. Neurons of 
the SCN that contain melatonin  Mel1A and

The following signaling steps are involved:
(1) Signals from the SCN are delivered 

to the intermediolateral cell column of the 
thoracic spinal cord by the hypothalamospinal 
tract.

(2) Signals from the spinal cord are trans-
mitted to the superior cervical ganglion by 
preganglionic sympathetic ﬁbers.

(3) Signals from the superior cervical 

ganglion are conducted by postganglionic 
sympathetic ﬁbers traveling in association with 
blood vessels entering the pineal gland. 
As noted earlier, the neural input to the 

pineal gland is norepinephrine, and the output 
is melatonin. 

Remember that retinal photoreceptors are 

the starting point of the neuronal input to 
pinealocytes.

The retina has two functions:
(1) The detection of light for the formation 

of images by transforming photon energy into 
an electrical signal, as we discuss in Chapter  
9, Sensory Organs: Vision and Hearing.

(2) Non-image forming (NIF) visual functions 

required for adjusting the internal circadian 
clock to light and sleep. NIF visual functions in-
volve a subset of melanopsin-producing retinal 
ganglion cells as indicated above. These cells, 
with NIF visual functions, are called intrinsically 
photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). 
The ipRGCs function as luminance detectors 
resetting the circadian oscillators.

Two clinical conditions related to the function 

of the pineal gland are signiﬁcant:

(1) Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a 

type of depression related to the shorter day 
length of the winter months. SAD has been 
observed in patients with bipolar disorders, 
characterized by a signiﬁcant switch in mood 
between periods of mania and depression. 
This indicates that ipRGCs and the SCN, in 
addition to its circadian pacemaker function, 
project to several regions of the brain to drive 
rhythms involved in inducing sleep or inﬂu-
ence mood. 

(2) Jet lag, a sleep disorder associated with 

fatigue, insomnia, diminished physical per-
formance, and disorientation experienced by 

many travelers, is caused by a temporary lack 
of alignment between the circadian rhythm 
and local time. 

Appropriately timed exposure to light and/or 
the administration of melatonin are strategies 
for jet lag treatment. 

Pineocytomas are tumors of the pineal 
gland. About 10 percent of lesions of the 
pineal gland are essentially benign, including 
pineal cysts. Another 10 percent of tumors are 
relatively benign, including low-grade gliomas. 

The remaining 80 percent of pineal region 

neoplasms are highly malignant lesions. 
These include germ cell tumors (pineal germi-
noma), embryonal carcinoma,  and malignant 
pineoblastoma. 

Pineocytomas are associated with preco-

cious puberty and with a neurologic disorder 
known as Parinaud’s syndrome (paralysis of 
upward gaze, looking steadily in one direction, 
pupillary areﬂexia to light, paralysis of conver-
gence, and wide-based gait). 

These ﬁndings provide support for the 

hypothesis that melatonin participates in the 
timing of puberty.

19. Endocrine System

The endocrine system is represented by a group of single cells and glands that produce and secrete peptide 
and steroid hormones in the bloodstream to modulate many functions of the body. Several endocrine glands, 
like the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands, are regulated by the hypothalamic–hypophyseal system. Others, 
like the parathyroid glands, responds to variations in the blood levels of calcium; and the main function of the 
pancreatic islet of Langerhans is under the control sugar levels in blood. In addition, there is a massive population 
of single endocrine cells distributed in several tissue of the body that are independent of the hypothalamic–hy-
pophyseal system and have a signiﬁcant functional and pathologic role. One of these cells is the C cell, housed 
in the thyroid gland and whose secretory product, calcitonin, balances the calcium regulatory function of the 
parathyroid glands. The cell target of the parathyroid glands is the osteoblast, whereas C cell targets the osteoclast. 
This chapter covers the structure and function of the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the parathyroid glands, 
the C cells, and the islets of Langerhans and provides insights concerning clinical and pathologic conditions. 

Thyroid gland
Development of the thyroid gland
The thyroid gland (Greek thyreos, shield; eidos, form) 
develops  as  a  median  endodermal  downgrowth  at 
the  base  of  the  tongue.  A  transient  structure,  the 
thyroglossal duct, connects the developing gland to 
its point of origin, the foramen cecum, at the back 
of the tongue. 

The  thyroglossal  duct  disappears  completely, 
leaving the thyroid to develop as a ductless gland. 
Persistent  thyroglossal  duct  tissue  remnants  may 
generally give rise to a cysts in the front area of the 
neck that looks like a lump. Surgical removal of an 
enlarging thyroglossal cyst in children may be neces-
sary to alleviate breathing and swallowing problems 
and the prevention of infections and even malignant 
transformation during adulthood. 

Maternal thyroid hormone is transferred to the 
fetus across the placenta throughout the ﬁrst trimes-
ter  of  pregnancy.  High  levels  of  thyroid  hormone 
are found in the fetal cerebral cortex between weeks 
12 and 20. 

At about week 22, the fetal thyroid gland responds 
to thyroid-stimulating  hormone (TSH) by produc-
ing endogenous thyroid hormone to enable perinatal 
brain development. 

The congenital absence of the thyroid gland causes 
irreversible neurologic damage in the infant (cretin-
ism). In adults, thyroid dysfunction correlates with 
neurologic and behavioral disorders.

Histologic organization of the thyroid gland
The thyroid gland consists of two lobes connected by 
a narrow band of thyroid tissue called the isthmus.
The  thyroid  gland  is  located  below  the  larynx 
and the lobes rest on the sides of the trachea.  The 
larynx provides a convenient landmark for locating 
the  thyroid  gland.  Remember  that  the  recurrent 
laryngeal  nerves  are  closely  related  to  the  thyroid 

gland, an  anatomic relationship of importance when 
a thyroidectomy procedure is required. 

The thyroid gland is surrounded by a connective 
tissue capsule. Two pairs of parathyroid glands, des-
ignated as superior and inferior parathyroid glands, 
are located on the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland.
Each lobe of the thyroid gland consists of numer-
ous follicles. The thyroid follicle, or acinus, is the 
structural and functional unit of the gland. 

A  thyroid  follicle  consists  of  a  single  layer  of 
cuboidal  epithelial  cells,  the  follicular  epithelium 
(Figures 19-1 and 19-2), enclosing a central lumen 
containing a colloid substance, The colloid is rich in 
thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein, yielding a 
periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–positive reaction. 

The follicular epithelium also contains about 10% 
of scattered parafollicular cells, also called C cells. C 
cells, derived from the neural crest, contain small cy-
toplasmic granules representing the stored hormone 
calcitonin (hence the designation C cells).

When the thyroid gland is hypoactive, as in dietary 
iodide deﬁciency, the follicle is enlarged with colloid. 
Because no triiodothyronine (T3) or  thyroxine (T4) 
is made to exert a negative feedback, TSH synthesis 
and secretion increase. TSH stimulates growth and 
vascularization of the thyroid gland. Consequently, 
the gland enlarges.

When  the  thyroid  gland  is  active,  the  follicular 
epithelium is columnar, and colloid droplets may be 
seen within the cells as well as large apical pseudopo-
dia and microvilli (see Figure 19-2). 

The thyroid epithelium is surrounded by a basal 
lamina  and  reticular  ﬁbers.  A  network  of  vasomo-
tor and sympathetic nerve ﬁbers and blood vessels, 
including fenestrated capillaries, can be observed in 
the connective tissue among thyroid follicles.

        At the apical plasma membrane, thyroid peroxidase is activated and 
converts iodide into iodine. Two iodine atoms are linked to each tyrosyl residue.        
Iodination occurs within the lumen of the thyroid follicle. 
    After proteolytic processing, one monoiodotyrosine peptide combines with 
diiodotyrosine to form T3 (triiodothyronine). Two diiodotyrosines combine to form 
T4 (thyroxine). One iodinated thyroglobulin molecule yields four molecules of T3 
and T4. 
    Clinical significance:  Propylthiouracil and methyl mercaptoimidazole 
(MMI) inhibit thyroid peroxidase–mediated iodination of tyrosine in thyroglobulin.

and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provide the energy for iodide 
transport.
    Clinical significance:  Thyroid follicular cell activity can be 
determined by measuring radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). Radiation 
thyroidectomy can be implemented by using larger amounts of 
radioactive iodine in cases of thyroid hyperfunction. Also, the iodide 
pump can be inhibited by perchlorate, a competitive anion.    

        T3 and T4 are released from the cell across the basal lamina 
6
of the thyroid follicle into a fenestrated capillary and bind to 
serum-binding proteins. Tissue-specific deiodinases expressed 
in peripheral tissues can increase local concentrations of T3 from 
circulating T4.  T3 has a shorter half-life (18 hours) than T4 (5 to 7 
days). T3 is 2 to 10 times more active than T4. Thyroid hormone 
action is predominantly mediated by thyroid hormone receptors 
(THRs), which are encoded by the thyroid hormone receptor α 
(THRA) and thyroid hormone receptor β (THRB) genes. 

limited storage capacity, the production of thyroid 
hormones depends on the follicular storage of the 
prohormone thyroglobulin in the colloid. 

A characteristic feature of the thyroid follicular 
epithelium is its ability to concentrate iodide from 

the blood and synthesize the hormones T3 and  T4.
The synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones 

involve two phases (Figure 19-3): 

1. An exocrine phase.
2. An endocrine phase.

  19.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Thyroid gland

Both phases are regulated by TSH by a mechanism 
that includes receptor binding and cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) production, as discussed in 
Chapter 3, Cell Signaling.

The exocrine phase (see Figure 19-3) consists of:
1. The uptake of inorganic iodide from the blood, 

stimulated by TSH.

2. The synthesis of thyroglobulin.
3. The incorporation of iodine into tyrosyl residues 

of thyroglobulin by thyroid peroxidase.

The  uptake  of  iodide  requires  an  adenosine  tri-
phosphate (ATP)–driven iodide pump present in the 
basal plasma membrane of the follicular cells. This 
active transport system is referred to as the iodide 
trap.  Intracellular  iodide  rapidly  diffuses  against 
concentration and electrical gradients to end up in 
the  colloid.  Anions,  such  as  perchlorate  (ClO4  –), 
are used clinically as a competitive inhibitor of the 
iodide pump to block iodide uptake by the thyroid 
follicular cell.

The  rough  endoplasmic  reticulum  and  Golgi 
apparatus are sites involved in the synthesis and gly-
cosylation of thyroglobulin, a 660-kd glycoprotein 
composed of two identical subunits. Thyroglobulin is 
packed in secretory vesicles and released by exocytosis 
into  the  colloidal  lumen. Thyroglobulin  contains 
about 140 tyrosine residues available for iodination.
Thyroid peroxidase, the enzyme responsible for 
the iodination of thyroglobulin, is a heme-containing 
glycoprotein anchored in the membrane of the same 
secretory vesicle that contains thyroglobulin. After 
exocytosis,  thyroid  peroxidase  is  exposed  at  the 
luminal surface of the thyroid follicular epithelium. 
Thyroid peroxidase, activated during exocytosis, 
oxidizes  iodide  to  iodine  within  the  colloid;  the 
iodine is then transferred to acceptor tyrosyl residues 
of thyroglobulin.  

Thyroid  peroxidase  activity  and  the  iodination 
process  can  be  inhibited  by  propylthiouracil  and 
methyl mercaptoimidazole (MMI). These antithy-
roid drugs primarily interfere with the synthesis of 
thyroid hormones in hyperactive glands.

The endocrine phase starts with the TSH-stimu-
lated endocytosis of iodinated thyroglobulin into the 
follicular cell (see Figure 19-3):

1. Colloid droplets are enveloped by apical pseudo-
pods and internalized to become colloid-containing 
vesicles.

2. Cytoskeletal components guide the colloid drop-
lets to lysosomes, which fuse with the colloid droplets. 
3. Lysosomal enzymes degrade iodothyroglobulin 
to release T3, the active form of the hormone, T4, 
and  other  intermediate  products.  Iodotyrosines, 
amino acids, and sugars are recycled within the cell.  
4. Thyroid hormones are then released across the 
basal  lamina  of  the  thyroid  follicular  epithelium 

and gain access to serum carrier proteins within the 
fenestrated capillaries. 

T3  has  a  shorter  half-life  (18  hours),  is  more 
potent, and less abundant than T4. The half-life of 
T4 is 5 to 7 days and represents about 90% of the 
secreted thyroid hormones. 

Tissue-specific  deiodinases  increase  the  local 
concentrations of T3 from circulating T4. There are 
three deiodinases:

1. Deiodinase 1 is found primarily in the liver.
2.  Deiodinase  2  is  only  expressed  in  astrocytes 
and  tanycytes,  glial  cell-derived  located  in  the  hy-
pothalamus. 

3. Deiodinase 3 is selectively expressed in neurons. 
Deiodinase 3 can also inactivate T4 and T3 to T3 and 
T2 by inner ring deiodination. Inactivation serves to 
down-regulate local concentrations of thyroid hor-
mone and protect the neurons from excessive levels 
of thyroid hormone.

In the central nervous system, thyroid hormones 
cross the blood-brain barrier utilizing transporters of 
the choroid plexus cells and through gaps between 
the end feet of astrocytes that fail to complete cover 
the brain capillaries. 

The primary site of action of T3, and to a lesser 
extent T4, is the cell nucleus. T3 binds to thyroid 
hormone receptor bound to a speciﬁc DNA region, 
called thyroid hormone–responsive element (TRE), 
to  induce  or  repress  speciﬁc  gene  transcription.  In 
cardiocytes, thyroid hormone regulates the expression 
of genes encoding phospholamban in the sarcoplas-
mic reticulum, (cid:96)-adrenergic receptors, Ca2+-ATPase, 
and others.   

Clinical signiﬁcance: Graves’ disease and 
hypothyroidism
Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disorder predomi-
nant in women, is caused by an antibody that acts 
as an agonist on the TSH  receptor.  (Figure 19-4). 
Binding of autoantibodies to TSH receptors results 
in the unregulated synthesis of thyroid hormone. 

Toxic adenoma and multinodular goiter (see Box 
19-A)  also  cause  unregulated  synthesis  of  thyroid 
hormone but this effect is triggered by a mutation in 
the TSH receptor gene, which results in constitutive 
activation. Spontaneous remission occurs in approxi-
mately 30% of patients with Graves’ disease but not 
in  patients  with  toxic  adenoma  and  multinodular 
goiter. A non-toxic adenoma is not associated with 
high thyroid hormone production. 

Thyroid follicular cells in Graves’ disease show hy-
pertrophy and hyperplasia  and secrete large amounts 
of thyroid hormones in the blood circulation in an 
unregulated fashion. Serum TSH level is suppressed 
and levels of serum T4 and T3 are elevated.

Graves’ disease: Pathogenesis 

Exophthalmos 

Excessive production of thyroid hormone is caused by the activation of 
thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (TSHRs) by an autoimmune 
response (antibodies produced against the TSHR).   
   Inflammatory cells in the stroma of the thyroid gland produce cytokines 
(interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor–(cid:95), and interferon-(cid:97)), that stimulate 
thyroid cells to produce cytokines, thus reinforcing the thyroidal 
autoimmune process. Antithyroid drugs reduce the production of cytokines 
(immunosuppressive effect), leading to remission in some patients.

Graves’ disease: Clinical characteristics

Two characteristics of Graves’ disease are exophthalmos and cardiac 
manifestations (palpitations and tachycardia). 
     Exophthalmos consists in the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate 
(T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) in the extraocular muscles and 
orbital tissue. Cytokines (produced by T cells) and anti-TSHR 
immunoglobulins (Igs) (produced by extraocular plasma cells) stimulate 
the function of orbital fibroblasts and their differentiation into 
adipocytes. 
    Overproduction of fat and the hygroscopic nature of proteoglycans 
contribute to the development of exophthalmos.

Graves’ ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of 
the extraocular muscles and an increase in orbital adipose and 
connective tissue. Circulating anti-TSHR Igs bind to the 
specific receptor expressed by fibroblasts in the retrobulbar 
tissue.  
    Cytokines produced by T cells in the inflammatory infiltrate 
stimulate adipogenesis from preadipocyte fibroblasts. 
    Fibroblasts produce proteoglycans and collagen fibers 
leading to retrobulbar edema and fibrosis of the extraocular 
muscles.

Triiodothyronine (T3) enters the nucleus of a cardiocyte, binds 
to its nuclear receptors, and then binds to thyroid hormone 
response element in target genes. 
    T3 stimulates phospholamban, a protein involved in the release 
and uptake of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This step is 
critical for systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation. The activity 
of phospholamban is regulated by its phosphorylation. Increased 
diastolic function in patients with hyperthyroidism is related to the 
role of phospholamban in thyroid hormone–mediated changes in 
the contractility of cardiac muscle.

of the eyes (exophthalmos; see Figure 19-4), tachy-
cardia, warm skin, and ﬁne ﬁnger tremors are typical 
clinical features. Toxic adenoma and multinodular 
goiter are not associated with exophthalmos.

From a functional perspective, an excess of thyroid 
hormones increases the basal metabolic and cardiac 
rate and the consumption of oxygen and nutrients.
1. A high metabolic condition increases appetite. 
2. Increased body heat production, determined by 
high oxygen consumption, makes patients feel hot.
3. Tachycardia is one of the consequences of thy-
roid  hormone  actions  in  heart.  Increased  cardiac 
rate is caused by the up-regulation of  (cid:96)1 adrener-
gic  receptors  in  cardiocytes  in  the  sinoatrial  node 
stimulated by thyroid hormones. Increase in cardiac 
muscle contractibility and cardiac output is triggered 
by the up-regulation of (cid:96)1 adrenergic receptors in 
the ventricular cardiac muscle. The active transport 
of Ca2+ into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
of  cardiocytes  is  controlled  by  phospholamban, 
whose activity is regulated by thyroid hormones (see 
Figure 19-4). 

In  summary,  the  classical  symptoms  of  thyro-
toxicosis are found in patients with Graves’ disease. 
Thyrotoxicosis means an excess of thyroid hormone 
in the body.  

How are patients with Graves’ disease treated?
The objective is to neutralize the effects of thyroid 
hormones by decreasing their synthesis and actions. 
1. Thyroid  hormone  synthesis  can  be  inhibited 

with drugs (see Figure 19-3).

2. Radioiodine can be given orally as a single dose 
of  131I-labeled  sodium  iodide  (Na131I)  in  liquid  or 
capsule form. Beta ray emissions of the radionuclide 
causes tissue necrosis, resulting in the functional re-
duction or inactivation of follicular thyroid cells over

3. Use of propranolol, a (cid:96)-adrenergic antagonist, to 
block  (cid:96)1 adrenergic receptors to manage tachycardia. 
This treatment also offsets increases in cardiac output 
and  arterial  blood  pressure  as  well  as  the  elevated 
thermogenesis caused by the hyperadrenergic state.

Surgery is required in patients with toxic adenoma 

and toxic multinodular goiter.

In the adult, hypothyroidism is generally caused by 
a thyroid disease. A decrease in the basal metabolic 
rate, hypothermia, and cold intolerance are observed. 
Decreased sweating and cutaneous vasoconstriction 
make the skin dry and cool. Afﬂicted individuals tend 
to feel cold in a warm room. 

Hypothyroidism  in  the  adult  is  manifested  by 
coarse skin with a puffy appearance due to the ac-
cumulation of proteoglycans and retention of ﬂuid 
in the dermis of the skin (myxedema) and muscle.  
Cardiac output is reduced, and the pulse rate slows 
down. Except for developmental disturbances, most 
symptoms are reversed when the thyroid disorder is 
corrected.

  As  previously  mentioned,  the  requirement  of 
thyroid hormone for development is most apparent 
in the central nervous system, where severe thyroid 
hormone deﬁciency in fetal and neonatal periods re-
sults in cretinism, a disorder characterized by mental 
retardation, deafness, and ataxia. These conditions 
are irreversible if not treated soon after birth. 

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, also called chronic lym-
phocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis (see 
Box 19-A), is a disease associated with hypothyroid-
ism and accumulation of lymphocytes in the stroma 
of the thyroid gland. 

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is caused by autoantibod-
ies targeting thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin 
(anti–thyroid  peroxidase  [anti–TPO]  and  anti-
thyroglobulin [anti–TG]antibodies). Progressive de-
struction of the thyroid follicles leads to a decrease 
in the function of the thyroid gland.  The level of T4 
in blood is lower than normal, whereas the level of 
TSH are above normal. The size of the thyroid gland 
is enlarged (goiter). Patients are treated with synthetic 
T4 (Synthroid).

Additional inﬂammatory conditions of the thyroid 
gland includes de Quervain’s thyroiditis and Riedel’s 
thyroiditis. 

Finally, papillary carcinoma is the most frequent 
malignant tumor of the thyroid gland. This tumor is 
locally invasive and spreads to cervical lymph nodes.  
Follicular  carcinoma,  is  the  second  most  frequent 
tumor of the thyroid gland (see Box 19-A). It is a 
slow growing tumor that usually spreads to bone by 
the hematogenous route.

The parathyroid gland consists of two cell types: (1) 
chief cells, which secrete parathyroid hormone 
(PTH); and (2) oxyphil cells, rich in mitochondria, 
representing probably a transitional form of chief 
cells. Cells are arranged in a cordlike arrangement, 
but a follicular-like arrangement can also be 
observed.

Chief cells synthesize and secrete PTH. 
Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a 
seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor 
dimer coupled to Gq(cid:95) protein on the plasma 
membrane of the parathyroid chief cell. A 
reduction in serum calcium levels activates 
CaSR and increases PTH secretion, 
leading to an increase in serum calcium.

Oxyphil cells appear after puberty and increase 
in number with age. They contain abundant 
mitochondria, which give this cell type an 
acidophilic staining in hematoxylin-eosin 
preparations. The rough endoplasmic reticulum 
and Golgi apparatus are not prominent. Oxyphil 
cells do not secrete PTH.

Calcium regulation
Ca2+ is  found inside and outside cells, is a major 
component of the skeleton, is required for muscle 
contraction, blood clotting, nerve impulse transmis-
sion, and enzymatic activities. Ca2+ is an essential 
mediator  in  cell  signaling  (for  example,  through 
calcium-binding calmodulin). 

Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by:

1.  Parathyroid  hormone  (PTH),  secreted  from 
the parathyroid glands. PTH acts on bone and the 
kidneys to raise Ca2+ levels in blood. 

2. Calcitonin, produced by C cells lodged in the 

thyroid gland, lowers Ca2+ levels in blood. 

3. Vitamin D (calcitriol, or 1,25-dihydroxychole-  
calciferol) enhances the uptake of Ca2+ by the small 
intestine  by  stimulating  the  synthesis  of  Ca2+-

binding  protein  calbindin  by  intestinal  epithelial 
cells  (enterocytes).  These  two  last  aspects  will  be 
discussed later in this chapter.

The key element in monitoring extracellular Ca2+ 
levels  is  the  extracellular  Ca2+-sensing  receptor 
(CaSR) of the parathyroid chief or principal cells.

 

Parathyroid glands
Development of the parathyroid glands
The four parathyroid glands derive from the third 
and fourth branchial pouches. The third branchial 
pouch  differentiates  into  the  inferior  parathyroid 
glands and the thymus. The fourth branchial pouch 
develops into the superior parathyroid glands and the 
ultimobranchial body. 

The parathyroid glands are on the posterolateral 
regions  of  the  thyroid  gland,  located  between  the 
thyroid  capsule  and  the  surrounding  cervical  con-
nective tissue. The yellow color of the adipose tissue-
containing parathyroid glands may be confused with 
surrounding fat. The accidental surgical removal of 
the normal parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery 
(thyroidectomy)  causes  tetany,  characterized  by 
spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles, leading 
to asphyxia and death.

Histologic organization of the parathyroid glands
The parenchyma of the parathyroid glands consists 
of two cell populations supplied by sinusoidal capil-
laries (Figure 19-5): 

1. The more numerous chief or principal cell.
2. The oxyphil or acidophilic cell. 
Cells  are  arranged  in  cordlike  or  follicular-like 
clusters.  Chief  or  principal  cells  contain  cytoplas-
mic granules with PTH, an 84-amino-acid peptide 
derived from a large precursor of 115 amino acids 
(preproPTH). This precursor gives rise to  proPTH 
(90 amino acids), which is processed by a proteolytic 
enzyme in the Golgi apparatus into PTH. PTH is 
stored in secretory granules. Magnesium is essential 
for PTH secretion. PTH is secreted into the blood 
and has a half-life of about 5 minutes. Serum Ca2+ 
levels normally average 9.5 mg/dL.  

Oxyphil  or  acidophilic  cells  contain  abundant 
mitochondria, which give this cell its typical pink-
reddish  stain.  Oxyphils  may  represent  transitional 
chief cells.

Signal transduction mediated by CaSR
A CaSR dimer is present in the plasma membrane 
of chief cells. CaSR activates Gq(cid:95)(cid:11)(cid:3)a subunit of het-
erotrimeric  G proteins. 

The G protein–linked cascade stimulates the action 
of  phospholipase  C.    Phospholipase  C  hydrolyzes 
phosphatidylinositol  4,5-bisphosphate  (PIP2)  to 
release intracellular IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) and 

diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 and DAG trigger the re-
lease of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites followed 
by a ﬂux of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol of the 
chief cells. 

The increase of intracellular Ca2+  levels prevents 
PTH,  contained  in  the  secretory  granules,  to  be 
released. An increase in serum Ca2+ levels (hypercal-
cemia) triggers intracellular signaling suppressing the 
secretion of PTH, with the consequent decrease in 
the serum Ca2+ concentration. When the serum Ca2+ 
concentration decreases (hypocalcemia), the secretion 
of  PTH  is  stimulated,  resulting  in  an  increase  in 
serum Ca2+.  Magnesium, like calcium, can activate 
CaSR and suppress PTH release.

In most cells, Ca2+ enters a cell through a mem-
brane-associated channel.  Chief cells are rather un-
usual because Ca2+ is a ligand for the CaSR resulting 
in the activation of Gq(cid:95) protein subunit.

Functions of the parathyroid hormone
PTH regulates the Ca2+ and PO4
by acting on two main sites: 

3– balance in blood 

1. In bone tissue, PTH stimulates the resorption 
of mineralized bone by osteoclasts and the release of 
Ca2+ into the blood. 

2. In the uriniferous tubules, PTH activates the 
production of active vitamin D (calcitriol) by stimu-
lating the activity of 1(cid:95)-hydroxylase. Vitamin D, in 
turn, stimulates the intestinal resorption of Ca2+. 
As you can see, PTH regulates indirectly Ca2+ levels 
by inducing the synthesis of an enzyme involved in 
the production of the active vitamin D metabolite 
in the kidneys. 

When  Ca2+  levels  are  low,  PTH  reestablishes 
homeostasis  by  acting  on  osteoblasts  to  induce 
osteoclastogenesis. As already discussed, PTH binds 
to a cell surface receptor of the osteoblast to regulate 
the synthesis of three proteins essential for the dif-
ferentiation and function of osteoclasts (review the 
discussion of osteoclastogenesis in Chapter 4, Con-
nective Tissue). 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Hyperparathyroidism and 
hypoparathyroidism 
Hyperparathyroidism is caused by a functional be-
nign tumor of the gland (adenoma). An abnormal 
increase in the secretion of PTH causes:

1.  Hypercalcemia  and  phosphaturia  (increased 

urinary excretion of PO4

3– anions).  

2. Hypercalciuria (increased urinary excretion of 
Ca2+)  leading  to  the  formation  of  renal  stones  in 
the calyces of the kidneys. When stones descend to 
the ureter, there is severe pain, caused by spasmodic 
contraction of the smooth muscle, hematuria (blood 
in the urine), and infections of the renal tract (py-
pyelonephritis).

3.  Hypercalcemia,  the  result  of  bone  deminer-
alization.  Extensive  bone  resorption  results  in  the 
development of cysts. 

Hypoparathyroidism is seen during the inadver-
tent removal or irreversible damage (disrupted blood 
supply) to the parathyroid glands during surgery of 
the thyroid gland. 

The occurrence of hypoparathyroidism depends on 
the surgeon’s experience and extent of thyroid resec-
tion determined by an underlying thyroid disease. 

Within  24  to  48  hours  of  surgical  removal  of 
the  parathyroid  glands,  hypocalcemia  determines 
increased  excitability  of  nervous  tissue,  including 
paresthesia (sensation of pins and needles), muscle 
cramping, twitching, and spasms. Attacks of laryn-
gospasm, bronchospasm, tetany, and seizures occur. 
These severe symptoms require intravenous calcium 
therapy followed by continuous infusions to achieve 
safe ionized Ca2+ blood levels.

Neuromuscular  symptoms  caused  by  acute  low 

blood Ca2+ concentration can be clinically tested: 

1.  A  positive  Chvostek  sign  is  the  twitching  of 

facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped.

2.  Trousseau  sign  results  in  carpopedal  spasm 
(contraction of the muscles and hands and feet) when 
a blood pressure cuff is applied. 

Administration  of  vitamin  D  and  calcium  and 
magnesium  supplements  or  synthetic  PTH  1-34, 
given twice daily, correct these alterations.

Clinical signiﬁcance: CaSR mutations 
Inactivating mutations of the CaSR are responsible 
for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and 
neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT).

  Heterozygous  individuals  with  FHH  have  one 
defective copy of the CaSR gene. Because of the di-
meric arrangement of the CaSR, the intact copy can 
rescue the function of the mutated copy.  

Two  defective  copies  (homozygous  condition) 
detected in the newborn causes NSHPT, associated 
with  severe  hypercalcemia,  bone  demineralization 
and multiple fractures. NSHPT requires immediate 
parathyroidectomy  early  in  life  to  prevent  a  fatal 
outcome.   

An activating mutation of the CaSR, autosomal 
dominant hypocalcemia, leads the parathyroid gland 
into assuming that the Ca2+ serum level is elevated 
when it is not. 

This condition determines a reduction in serum 
Ca2+ and PTH levels. In addition, CaSR can also be 
a target of autoimmunity determined by autoantibod-
ies against the receptor that can either activate the 
CaSR or inactivate the CaSR (causing a syndrome 
similar to FHH). 

Calcimimetic  synthetic  drugs,  which  activate 
CaSR, reduce pathologic elevations of PTH. CaSR-

blocking drugs, called calcilytics, may be useful for 
the treatment of osteoporosis.   

C cells (thyroid follicle)  
C cells derive from neural crest cells and are associated 
with thyroid follicles. C cells:

1. Represent about 0.1% of the mass of thyroid 

tissue.

2. May be present within (or outside) the thyroid 

follicle but are not in contact with the colloid.

3. Produce calcitonin, encoded by a gene located 
on the short arm of chromosome 11 (Figure 19-6). 
  Calcitonin  is  a  32-amino-acid  peptide  derived 
from a 136-amino-acid precursor. It is stored in secre-
tory granules. The calcitonin gene is also expressed in 
other tissues (hypothalamus and hypophysis), giving 
rise  to  a  calcitonin  gene–related  peptide  (CGRP) 
consisting of 37 amino acids. CGRP has neurotrans-
mitter and vasodilator properties.

The main function of calcitonin is to antagonize 
the effects of PTH. Calcitonin suppresses the mo-
bilization of calcium from bone by osteoclasts trig-
gered by an increase in cAMP.  Calcitonin secretion 
is stimulated by an increase in blood levels of calcium 
(hypercalcemia).  

Vitamin D
Vitamin D2 is formed in the skin by the conversion 
of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol following 
exposure  to  ultraviolet  light  (Figure  19-7).  Chole-
calciferol is then absorbed into the blood circulation 
and  transported  to  the  liver  where  it  is  converted 
to  25-hydroxycholecalciferol  by  the  addition  of  a 
hydroxyl group to the side chain. 

In the nephron, two events can occur: 
1. Low calcium levels and hypophosphatemia can 
determine PTH to stimulate the enzymatic activity 
of  mitochondrial  1(cid:95)-hydroxylase  to  add  another 
hydroxyl group to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to form 
1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the active 
form of vitamin D.   

2. High Ca2+ levels can stimulate the enzymatic 
activity of 24-hydroxylase to convert 25-hydroxycho-
lecalciferol  to  biologically  inactive  24,25-hydroxy-
cholecalciferol.  

Calcitriol (active form) and 24,25-hydroxychole-
calciferol (inactive form) circulate in blood bound to 
a vitamin D–binding protein.

The main function of vitamin D is to stimulate 
the  absorption  of  Ca2+  by  the  intestinal  mucosa.  
Ca2+ is absorbed by:

1.  Transcellular  absorption  (active  mechanism) 
in the duodenum, an active process that involves the 
import of Ca2+ by enterocytes through voltage-insen-
sitive channels, its transport across the cell, assisted 
by the carrier protein calbindin, and its release from 

Vitamin D

In the duodenum, calcitriol binds to cytosol and nuclear

of a specific mRNA.
    Calbindin transports Ca2+ across the enterocyte and, 
through a Ca2+ insensitive ATPase-dependent channel, into 
the bloodstream (active transport).
    In the jejunum and ileum, Ca2+ is transported across the 
intercellular space into the blood (passive transport).

2. Paracellular absorption (passive mechanism) in 
the jejunum and ileum, through tight junctions into 
the intercellular spaces, and into blood. A small frac-
tion (about 10%) of Ca2+ absorption takes place in 
the large intestine by active and passive mechanisms.
 Vitamin D, like all steroids, is transported to the 
nucleus of the intestinal cell to induce the synthesis 
of a calcium-binding protein, calbindin.  

Clinical signiﬁcance: Rickets and osteomalacia
In children, a deﬁciency of vitamin D causes rickets. 

In  adults,  the  corresponding  clinical  condition  is 
osteomalacia. The calciﬁcation of the bone matrix 
osteoid is deﬁcient in both conditions.

In rickets, bone remodeling is defective. The ends 
of the bones bulge (rachitic rosary at the costochon-
dral  junctions),  and  poor  calciﬁcation  of  the  long 
bones causes bending (bowlegs or knock-knees).

In osteomalacia, pain, partial bone fractures, and 

muscular weaknesses are typical in the adult.

Chronic renal failure or a congenital disorder, re-
sulting in the lack of 1(cid:95)-hydroxylase, can also cause 
rickets or osteomalacia.

Adrenal cortex

 

Adrenal (suprarenal) glands
Development of the adrenal gland
The adrenal (or suprarenal) glands develop from two 
separate embryologic tissues:

1. The neural crest ectoderm.
2. The mesoderm. 
During the sixth to seventh week of embryonic 

development:

1. Cells from the celomic epithelium aggregate on 
each side, between the developing gonads and the 
dorsal mesentery, to form the fetal cortex. 

2. The medulla originates from neural crest cells 
migrating from the adjacent sympathetic ganglia into 
the medial region of the fetal cortex.

3. A layer of mesodermic cells surrounds the fetal 
cortex to form the precursor of the adult adrenal 
cortex.

4. Mesenchymal cells surround each developing ad-
renal gland and differentiate into ﬁbroblasts that form 
the perirenal fascia and capsule. At this time, blood 
vessels and nerves of each adrenal gland develop. 

At birth, the adrenal glands are 20 times relatively 
larger than they are in the adult. The zonae glomeru-
losa and fasciculata are present. They produce cortico-
steroids as well as androgen and estrogen precursors 
under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH) secreted by the fetal pituitary gland. The 
zona reticularis is not apparent. Modest amounts of 
epinephrine are produced by the adrenal medulla.

By the third month after birth, the celomic-derive 
fetal cortex regresses and disappears within the ﬁrst 
year  of  life. The  mesoderm-derived  adrenal  cortex 
precursor, consisting of the zona glomerulosa and the 
zona fasciculata, remains as the deﬁnitive cortex. The 
zona reticularis develops by the end of the third year. 
Ectopic adrenocortical or medullary tissue may be 
found retroperitoneally, inferior to the kidneys, along 
the  aorta,  and  in  the  pelvis.  Aggregates  of  ectopic 
chromafﬁn cells, called paraganglia, can be a site of 
tumor growth (pheochromocytoma).

Functions of the fetal adrenal cortex
During the early stage of gestation, the adrenal cortex 
synthesizes dehydroepiandrosterone, a precursor of 
the synthesis of estrogen by the placenta. A lack of 
3(cid:96)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity prevents 
the synthesis of progesterone, glucocorticoids, and 
androstenedione.  

The interaction between the fetal adrenal cortex 
and the placenta constitutes the fetoplacental unit 
(see  Chapter  23,  Fertilization,  Placentation,  and 
Lactation).

Glucocorticoids, either of maternal origin or syn-
thesized  from  placental  progesterone  by  the  fetus, 
are essential for three main developmental events: 

1. The production of surfactant by type II alveolar 

cells after the eighth month of fetal life.

2. The development of a functional hypothalamo-

pituitary axis.

3. The induction of thymic involution.

Histologic organization of the adrenal cortex
The adrenal glands (Latin ad, near; ren, kidney) are 
associated  with  the  superior  poles  of  each  kidney.  
Each gland consists of a yellowish outer cortex (80% 
to 90% of the gland) and a reddish inner medulla 
(10% to 20%). 

Each adrenal gland is surrounded by perinephritic 
fat and enclosed by the renal fascia. A thin connective 
tissue capsule separates each gland from its associated 
kidney. An arterial plexus, derived from three adrenal 
arteries, is located in the adrenal gland capsule. We 
discuss later the functional signiﬁcance of the adrenal 
vasculature.

Each adrenal gland has a cortex and a medulla.
The  adrenal  cortex  consists  of  three  concentric 

zones (Figures 19-8):

1. The outermost layer of the cortex is the zona 
glomerulosa, just under the capsule (see Figure 19-8). 
2. The    middle  layer  of  the  cortex  is  the  zona 

fasciculata (Figure 19-9). 

3. The innermost layer of the cortex, adjacent to 
the adrenal medulla, is the zona reticularis (Figure 
19-10). 

Zona glomerulosa

The zona glomerulosa (Latin glomus, ball) has the 

following characteristics (see Figure 19-8): 

1. It  lies under the capsule.
2. It represents 10% to 15% of the cortex.
3. Its cells aggregate into a glomerulus-like arrange-
ment and have a moderate amount of lipid droplets 
in the cytoplasm.

4. It lacks the enzyme 17(cid:95)-hydroxylase (CYP17)
and, therefore, cannot produce cortisol or sex steroids 
(Figure 19-11).

The zona glomerulosa is primarily angiotensin II 
(ANG II)–dependent; it is not ACTH–dependent. 
ANG II stimulates the growth of the zona glomeru-
losa and the synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldo-
sterone (see Figure 19-11, Figure 19-12).

ANG II is an octapeptide derived from the conver-
sion of  the angiotensin I (ANG I) decapeptide in 
the pulmonary circulation by angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE, see Chapter 14, Urinary System).

Aldosterone  has  a  half-life  of  20  to  30  minutes 
and acts directly on the distal convoluted tubule and 
collecting tubule, where it increases Na+ reabsorption 
and water (as a consequence of Na+ reabsorption) and 
excretion of K+and H+.

During aldosterone action, aldosterone binds to in-
tracellular receptor proteins to activate transcription

        The zona glomerulosa is a narrow subcapsular zone contiguous on its inner side 
with the zona fasciculata. The zona glomerulosa consists of concentrically arranged cells 
surrounded by a stroma containing capillaries. The cells contain a few lipid droplets and a 
well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 
    Cells of the zona glomerulosa secrete the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone 
under control of angiotensin II (ANG II). 

        The zona fasciculata predominates in the adrenal cortex. It consists of polygonal 
2
cells arranged in vertical columns or fascicles perpendicular to the capsule. The cells 
contain a vacuolated cytoplasm reflecting the accumulation of lipid droplets containing 
cholesterol and its metabolites. Fenestrated capillaries separate adjacent cell columns. 
    Cells of the zona fasciculata secrete mainly glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol) 
under adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) regulation.

3
        The zona reticularis is thinner than the zona fasciculata but thicker than the zona 
glomerulosa. It consists of  anastomosing cells forming a reticulum or network 
surrounded by fenestrated capillaries. The cells contain a brown pigment (lipofuscin) 
contrasting with the lighter staining of the zona fasciculata. 
    Cells of the zona reticularis secrete mainly steroid sex hormones under ACTH 
regulation.

        The adrenal medulla consists of two cell populations surrounded by venous 
4
sinusoids: the epinephrine/adrenaline-secreting cells (80%) and norepinephrine/ 
noradrenaline-secreting cells (20%). Epinephrine and norepinephrine are 
catecholamines. Catecholamines of the medulla generate a brown color when exposed 
to air or the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate (chromaffin reaction).

Aldosterone-responsive  cells  do  not  respond 
to  the  glucocorticoid  cortisol  because  cortisol  is 
converted  in  the  liver  to  cortisone  by  the  enzyme 
11(cid:96)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Cortisone does 
not bind to the aldosterone receptor.

Zona fasciculata
The zona fasciculata (Latin fascis, bundle) makes up 
75% of the cortex. It consists of cuboid cells, with 
the  structural  features  of  steroid-producing  cells, 
arranged in longitudinal cords separated by cortical 
fenestrated capillaries, or sinusoids. 

The cytoplasm of  zona fasciculata cells shows three 
components  that  characterize  their  steroidogenic 
function (see Figures 19-8 and 19-9): 

1. The  steroid  hormone  precursor  cholesterol  is 
stored in abundant lipid droplets. When lipids are 
extracted  during  histologic  preparation  or  are  un-
stained by the standard hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) 
procedures, the cells of the zona fasciculata display a 
foamy appearance and are called spongiocytes.

2. Mitochondria with tubular cristae containing 

steroidogenic enzymes.

3. Well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, 
also with enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid 
hormones.

Cells  of  the  zona  fasciculata  are  stimulated 
by  ACTH.  In  the  presence  of  17(cid:95)-hydroxylase 
(CYP17),  cells  of  the  zona  fasciculata  produce 
glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol (see Figures 19-11 
and 19-12). Cortisol is not stored in the cells and 
new synthesis, stimulated by ACTH, is required for 
achieving  a  cortisol  increase  in  blood  circulation. 
Cortisol is converted in hepatocytes to cortisone.

Cortisol has two major effects: 
1. A metabolic effect: The effects of cortisol are 
opposite  to  those  of  insulin.  In  the  liver,  cortisol 
stimulates gluconeogenesis to increase the concentra-
tion of glucose in blood. Remember this concept. It 
becomes useful to understand ﬂuctuations in blood 
glucose levels in the diabetic patient.

2.  An  anti-inﬂammatory  effect:  Cortisol  sup-
presses tissue responses to injury and decreases cellular 
and humoral immunity.

Zona reticularis
 The zona reticularis (Latin rete, net) makes up 5% 
to 10% of the cortex. Cells of the zona reticularis 
form an anastomosing network of short cellular cords 
separated by fenestrated capillaries. 

The cells of this zone are acidophilic, due to abun-
dant lysosomes, large lipofuscin granules, and fewer 
lipid droplets (see Figures 19-8 and 19-10). 

Cells  of  the  zona  fasciculata  are  stimulated  by 
corticotropin (ACTH) and produce sex hormones. 

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstene-
dione are the predominant androgens produced by 
the  cortex  of  the  adrenal  gland  (see  Figures  19-11 
and 19-12).  

Although DHEA and androstenedione are weak 
androgens,  they  can  be  converted  to  testosterone 
and even to estrogen in peripheral tissues. It is in-
teresting to note that the female hormone estradiol 
derives from the male hormone testosterone, and that 
testosterone has the female hormone progesterone as 
a precursor.

The adrenal gland is the major source of androgens 
in women; these androgens stimulate the growth of 
pubic and axillary hair during puberty.

Adrenal medulla
The  adrenal  medulla  contains chromafﬁn  cells,  so 
named because of their ability to acquire a brown 
coloration  when  exposed  to  an  aqueous  solution 
of  potassium  dichromate. This  reaction  is  due  to 
the oxidation of catecholamines by chrome salts to 
produce a brown pigment. 

Chromaffin  cells  (see  Figure  19-8)  are  modi-
ﬁed  sympathetic  postganglionic  neurons,  without 
postganglionic  processes,  derived  from  the  neural 
crest and forming  epithelioid cords surrounded by 
fenestrated capillaries. 

In addition, small numbers of sympathetic gan-
glion cells are commonly observed in the medulla 
(Figure 19-13). 

The cytoplasm of chromafﬁn cells contains mem-
brane-bound dense granules consisting in part of ma-
trix proteins, called chromogranins, and one class of 
catecholamine, either epinephrine or norepinephrine 
(adrenaline or noradrenaline). Some granules contain 
both epinephrine and norepinephrine. Minimal secre-
tion of dopamine also occurs, but the role of adrenal 
dopamine is not known.

Catecholamines are secreted into the blood instead 
of  being  secreted  into  a  synapse,  as  in  postgangli-
onic  terminals. The  adrenal  medulla  is  innervated 
by  sympathetic  preganglionic  ﬁbers  that  release 
acetylcholine.

Two different chromafﬁn cell types are present. 
About  80%  of  the  cells  produce  epinephrine  and 
20%  synthesize  norepinephrine. These  two  cell 
populations can be distinguished at the electron mi-
croscope level by the morphology of the membrane-
bound granules:

1.  Norepinephrine  is  stored  in  granules  with  an 

eccentric core (not shown).  

2. Epinephrine-containing granules are smaller and 

occupy a central core (see Figure 19-13). 

Note  an  important  difference  with  cells  of  the 
adrenal cortex: cells from the adrenal cortex do not 
store their steroid hormones in granules.

cristae housing the 
enzymes involved in 
steroidogenesis; and (3)

reticulum, also containing 
membrane-associated 
enzymes involved in the 
production of steroids.

Cells of the zona reticularis are smaller than the cells of the zonae 
glomerulosa and fasciculata and contain fewer lipid droplets and 
mitochondria. However, mitochondria still display the characteristic tubular 
cristae. A structural feature not prominent in the cells of the other cortical 
zones is the presence of lysosomes and deposits of lipofuscin.     
    Lipofuscin is a remnant of lipid oxidative metabolism reflecting 
degradation within the adrenal cortex. 
    There are other relevant characteristics of the zona reticularis. (1) It 
receives steroid-enriched blood from the zonae glomerulosa 
(mineralocorticoids) and fasciculata (mainly cortisol). (2) It is in close 
proximity to the catecholamine-producing cells of the adrenal medulla.   
(3) In response to adrenocorticoptropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, cells 
of the zonae reticularis and fasciculata produce androgens 
(dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione). Cells of the zona 
reticularis synthesize dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.     

      

         Clinical significance: Adrenogenital syndrome

Although dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and 
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate are weak androgens, they can 
be converted outside the adrenal cortex into more potent 
androgens and also estrogens.  
   This androgen conversion property has clinical significance in 
pathologic conditions such as the adrenogenital syndrome.       
   An excessive production of androgens in the adrenogenital 
syndrome in women leads to masculinization (abnormal sexual 
hair development, hirsutism, and enlargement of the clitoris). 
    In the male, adrenal androgens do not replace testicular 
androgens produced by Leydig cells. In women, adrenal 
androgens are responsible for the growth of axillary and pubic 
hair.

Catecholamines are synthesized from tyrosine to 
DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) in the presence 
of tyrosine hydroxylase (see Figure 19-13). DOPA 
is converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. 

Dopamine is transported into existing granules and 
converted inside them by dopamine (cid:96)-hydroxylase 
to norepinephrine. 

The  membrane  of  the  granules  contains  the

enzymes  required  for  catecholamine  synthesis  and 
ATP-driven pumps for the transport of substrates. 
Once synthesized, norepinephrine leaves the gran-
ule to enter the cytosol, where it is converted to epi-
nephrine in a reaction driven by the enzyme phenyl-
ethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The 
synthesis of PNMT is induced by glucocorticoids 
transported from the cortex to the medulla by the 
adrenocortical capillary system. When the conversion 
step to epinephrine is completed, epinephrine moves 
back to the membrane-bound granule for storage.

The degradation of catecholamines in the presence 
of    the  enzymes  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  and 
catechol  O-methyltransferase  (COMT)  yields  the 
main  degradation  products  vanillylmandelic  acid 
(VMA)  and  metanephrine,  which  are  eliminated 
in urine. Urinary VMA and metanephrine are used 
clinically  to  determine  the  level  of  catecholamine 
production in a patient.

Adrenergic receptors (cid:95) and (cid:96) 
Catecholamines  bind  to  (cid:95)-  and  (cid:96)-adrenergic  re-
ceptors in target cells. There are (cid:95)1-, (cid:95)2-, (cid:96)1-, and 
(cid:96)2-adrenergic receptors. 

Epinephrine has greater binding afﬁnity for (cid:96)2-
adrenergic  receptors  than  norepinephrine.  Both 

hormones have similar binding afﬁnity for (cid:96)1-, (cid:95)1-, 
and (cid:95)2-adrenergic receptors.

The  stimulation  of  (cid:95)-adrenergic  receptors  of  
blood  vessels  by  epinephrine  causes  vasoconstric-
tion. In blood vessels of skeletal muscle, activation 
of  (cid:96)2-adrenergic  receptors  by  epinephrine  causes 
vasodilation. 

The adrenergic receptors of the cardiac muscle are 
(cid:96)1-adrenergic receptors, and both epinephrine and 
norepinephrine have comparable effects.  Remember 
the clinical consequences of the up regulation of (cid:96)1-
adrenergic receptors in Graves’ disease. 

Blood supply to the adrenal gland
Similar to all endocrine organs, the adrenal glands are 
highly vascularized. Arterial blood derives from three 
different sources (Figure 19-14): 

1. The inferior phrenic artery, which gives rise to 

the superior adrenal artery.

2. The aorta, from which the middle adrenal artery 

branches out.

3. The renal artery, which gives rise to the inferior 

adrenal artery.

All three adrenal arteries enter the adrenal gland 
capsule  and  form  an  arterial  plexus. Three  sets  of 
branches emerge from the plexus:

         Most of the cholesterol, the precursor for

the biosynthesis of all steroid hormones, derives 
from circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL). 
Cholesterol is esterified by acylCoA cholesterol 
acyltransferase to be stored in cytoplasmic lipid 
droplets.  
   Cholesterol is modified by a series of 
hydroxylation reactions. Enzymes located in the 
mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum 
participate in the reactions. The substrates 
shuttle from mitochondria to smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria during 
steroidogenesis. 

Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein 

(StAR)

        The steroidogenic acute regulatory 
2
protein (StAR) is a cholesterol transfer protein. 
StAR regulates the synthesis of steroids by 
transporting cholesterol across the outer 
mitochondrial membrane to the inner 
mitochondrial membrane, where cytochrome 
P450SCC, the rate-limiting enzyme of 
steroidogenesis is located.  
        A mutation in the gene encoding StAR or 
3
P450SCC is detected in individuals with defective 
synthesis of adrenal and gonadal steroids (lipoid 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, LCAH).

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)

CAH results from genetic enzymatic defects in the 
synthesis of cortisol. However, the adrenal cortex 
is responsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH) and, therefore, cortical hyperplasia 
develops.
    In a large number of patients (90%), CAH is 
caused by an inborn defect in 21-hydroxylase 
(CYP21), the enzyme that converts 
17-hydroxyprogesterone to deoxycorticosterone. 
The precursor is instead converted to androgens. 
Aldosterone is lacking and hypoaldosteronism 
develops (with hypotension and low Na+ in 
plasma). Circulating androgens are high and 
virilization is found in female infants. 

1. One set supplies the capsule. 
2. The second set enters the cortex forming straight 
fenestrated capillaries (also called sinusoids), perco-
lating between the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata, 
and forming a capillary network in the zona reticularis 
before entering the medulla.

3. The third set generates medullary arteries that 
travel along the cortex and, without branching, sup-
ply blood only to the medulla.

This blood vessel distribution results in:

1. A dual blood supply to the adrenal medulla.
2. The transport of cortisol to the medulla, nec-
essary for the synthesis of PNMT, required for the 
conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine. 

3. The direct supply of blood to the adrenal me-

dulla, involved in rapid responses to stress.

There are no veins or lymphatics in the adrenal 

cortex. 

The adrenal cortex and medulla are drained by the 

central vein, present in the adrenal medulla.

20% produce norepinephrine. 

Norepinephrine is stored in granules with an  
eccentric core (not shown). 
    Epinephrine-containing granules are smaller 
and occupy a central core.
    In addition to catecholamines, granules in 
chromaffin cells also contain chromogranins (matrix 
proteins) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Chromaffin cells are arranged in clusters, or 
cords, and supplied by abundant capillaries 
(sinusoids) lined by fenestrated endothelial 
cells. Chromaffin cells are supported by a 
delicate stroma formed by reticular cells.

The medullary artery, 
derived from the inferior 
adrenal artery, enters the 
cortex within a connective

adrenal medulla.

Medullary artery 

The medullary artery 
bypasses the cortex 
without branching. In the 
medulla, the artery joins 
with branches from the 
cortical capillaries to form  
medullary venous 
sinuses. Thus, the medulla 
has two blood supplies: 
one from cortical capillaries 
and the other from the 
medullary artery.

The conversion of 
norepinephrine to epinephrine 
by chromaffin cells is 
dependent on 
phenylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase (PNMT), 
an enzyme activated by 
cortisol transported by the 
cortical capillaries to the 
medullary venous sinuses.

Pathology: The adrenal cortex
Zona glomerulosa: A tumor localized in the zona glo-
merulosa can cause excessive secretion of aldosterone. 
This rare condition is known as primary hyperaldo-
steronism, or Conn’s syndrome.  A more common 
cause of hyperaldosteronism is an increase in renin 
secretion (secondary hyperaldosteronism).

Zona fasciculata: An increase in aldosterone, cor-
tisol, and adrenal androgen production, secondary 
to ACTH production, occurs in Cushing’s disease.  
Cushing’s disease is caused by an ACTH-producing 
tumor of the anterior hypophysis.  

Adrenocortical adenoma, a functional tumor of 
the adrenal cortex can also result in overproduction 
of  cortisol,  as  well  as  of  aldosterone  and  adrenal 
androgens.

This clinical condition is described as Cushing’s 
syndrome  (as  opposed  to  Cushing’s  disease). The 
symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome reﬂect the multiple 
actions of an excess of glucocorticoids, in particular, 
on the carbohydrate metabolism. The effects of cor-
tisol are opposite to those of insulin.

Zona reticularis: When compared with the gonads, 
the zona reticularis secretes insigniﬁcant amounts of 
sex hormones. However, sex hormone hypersecretion 
becomes signiﬁcant when an adrenalcortical adenoma 
is associated with virilization or feminization.  

An  acute  destruction  of  the  adrenal  gland  by 
meningococcal septicemia in infants is the cause of  
Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (or hemorrhagic 
adrenalitis) producing adrenocortical insufﬁciency.

A chronic destruction of the adrenal cortex by an 
autoimmune  process  or  tuberculosis  results  in  the 
classic Addison’s disease. 

In  Addison’s  disease,  ACTH  secretion  increases 
because of the cortisol deﬁciency. ACTH can cause 
an increase in skin pigmentation, in particular in the 
skin folds and gums. The loss of mineralocorticoids 
leads to hypotension and circulatory shock. 

A loss of cortisol decreases vasopressive responses 
to  catecholamines  and  leads  to  an  eventual  drop 
in  peripheral  resistance,  thereby  contributing  to 
hypotension. A deﬁciency in cortisol causes muscle 
weakness (asthenia).

Pathology: Pheochromocytoma
Adrenal pheochromocytoma (or adrenal medullary 
paraganglioma) is a rare neoplasm that arises from 
the chromafﬁn cells. 

Pheochromocytoma causes sustained or episodic 
hypertension, tachycardia, and tremor. The gross 
appearance of a pheochromocytoma is a hemorrhagic 
mass. Microscopically, the tumor displays a cellular 
cluster and/or a trabecular pattern surrounded by an 
abundant sinusoidal-capillary network. Chromogra-
nins are markers for pheochromocytoma. 

When  pheochromocytomas  are  associated  with 
other endocrine tumors, they are a component of 
the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome. 
The presence of large amounts of VMA in urine has 
diagnostic relevance.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a familial 
inherited condition in which a mutation in the gene 
encoding  steroidogenic  acute  regulatory  protein 
(StAR) or cytochrome P450SCC, causes a deﬁciency 
in adrenocortical and gonadal steroidogenesis. StAR 
regulates  the  synthesis  of  steroids  by  transport-
ing  cholesterol  across  the  outer  mitochondrial 
membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane. 
Cytochrome P450SCC is the rate-limiting enzyme 
of steroidogenesis located in the inner mitochondrial 
membrane.  A  steroidogenic  deﬁciency  increases 
ACTH secretion, leading to adrenal hyperplasia.

Adrenal hyperplasia is seen in individuals with a 
deﬁciency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase who can-
not  produce  cortisol  or  mineralocorticoids. These 
individuals are hypotensive because of a difﬁculty in 
retaining salt and maintaining  extracellular volume. 
A deﬁciency in the enzyme 11-hydroxylase (CYP11) 
results in the synthesis and accumulation of  the min-
eralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone (DOC). Patients 
with this deﬁciency retain salt and water and become 
hypertensive.

See Figure 19-11 for the roles of 21-hydroxylase 
(CYP21) and 11-hydroxylase (CYP11) in the syn-
thesis of cortisol and mineralocorticoids.  

Endocrine pancreas
Development of the pancreas
By week 4, two outpocketings from the endodermal 
lining of the duodenum develop as the ventral and 
dorsal pancreas, each with its own duct. The ventral 
pancreas forms the head of the pancreas and associ-
ates with the common bile duct. The dorsal pancreas 
forms part of the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. 
By week 12, pancreatic acini develop from the ducts. 
The endocrine pancreas develops at the same time 
as  the  exocrine  pancreas.  Endocrine  cells  are  ﬁrst 
observed along the base of the differentiating exocrine 
acini by weeks 12 to 16.

Islets of Langerhans
The pancreas has two portions: 

1. The  exocrine  pancreas,  consisting  of  acini 
involved  in  the  synthesis  and  secretion  of  several 
digestive enzymes transported by a duct system into 
the duodenum (see Chapter 17, Digestive Glands). 
2. The endocrine pancreas (2% of the pancreatic 
mass), formed by the islets of Langerhans scattered 
throughout the pancreas. 

Each islet of Langerhans is formed by two com-

ponents:

1. A vascular component, the insuloacinar portal 
system (see Figure 19-15), which consists of an affer-
ent arteriole giving rise to a capillary network lined by 
fenestrated endothelial cells. Venules leaving the islets 
of Langerhans supply blood to adjacent pancreatic 
acini. This portal system enables the local action of 
insular hormones on the exocrine pancreas. 

An independent vascular system, the acinar vas-
cular system, supplies blood directly to the exocrine 
pancreatic acini.

2.  Anastomosing cords of endocrine cells, A ((cid:95) 
cells), B ((cid:96) cells), D ((cid:98)(cid:3)cells), and F cells, each secret-
ing a single hormone (Figure 19-16). 

A cells ((cid:95) cells) produce glucagon, beta cells syn-
thesize  insulin, delta cells  secrete gastrin and soma-
tostatin, and F cells produce pancreatic polypeptide.
Glucagon, a 29-amino-acid peptide, is stored in 
granules that are released by exocytosis when there 
is  a  decrease  in  the  plasma  levels  of  glucose.  Glu-
cagon  increases  glucose  blood  levels  by  increasing 
hepatic glycogenolysis. Glucagon binds to a speciﬁc 
membrane-bound receptor and this binding results 
in the synthesis of cAMP.

B cells ((cid:96) cells) produce insulin, a 6-kd polypeptide 

consisting of two chains (Figure 19-17): 

1. Chain A, with 21 amino acids,
2. Chain B, with 30 amino acids. 
Chains A and B are linked by disulﬁde bonds.
Insulin derives from a large single-chain precursor, 
preproinsulin, encoded by a gene located on the short 
arm of chromosome 11. Preproinsulin is synthesized 
in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is processed 
in the Golgi apparatus.

The large precursor gives rise to proinsulin (9 kd; 
86 amino acids) in which C peptide connects A and 
B chains. Removal of C peptide by speciﬁc proteases 
results in:

1. The separation of chains A and B.
2. The organization of a crystalline core consisting 
of a hexamer and zinc atoms. C peptide surrounds 
the crystalline core. 

An increase in blood glucose stimulates the release 
of both insulin and C peptide stored in secretory 
granules. 

Glucose is taken up by B cells by an insulin-inde-
pendent, glucose transporter protein-2 (GLUT-2),

and stored insulin is released in a Ca2+–dependent 
manner.

If  glucose  levels  remain  high,  new  synthesis  of 
insulin occurs. GLUT-2 is also present in hepatocytes.
 Insulin is required for increasing the transport of 
glucose in cells (predominantly in hepatocytes, skel-
etal and cardiac muscle, ﬁbroblasts, and adipocytes). 
This is accomplished by:

1. The transmembrane transport of glucose and 

amino acids.

2. The formation of glycogen in hepatocytes and 

skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.

3. The  conversion  of  glucose  to  triglycerides  in 

adipose cells (Figure 19-18).

Insulin  initiates  its  effect  by  binding  to  the  (cid:95) 
subunit of its receptor.  The insulin receptor consists 
of two subunits,(cid:3)(cid:95) and(cid:3)(cid:96). The intracellular domain 
of the (cid:96) subunit has tyrosine kinase activity, which 
autophosphorylates and triggers a number of intra-
cellular responses. 

One  of  these  responses  is  the  translocation  of 
glucose transporter protein-4 (GLUT-4) from the 
Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane to facilitate 
the uptake of glucose. GLUT-4 is insulin-dependent 
and is present in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac 
muscle.

Note the  functional difference between GLUT-2 

and GLUT-4: 

1. GLUT-2 is insulin-independent and serves to 
transport glucose to insular B cells and hepatocytes.
2.  GLUT-4  is  insulin-dependent  and  serves  to 

remove glucose from blood. 

A  ((cid:95)(cid:9)  cells  produce  glucagon,  a  29-amino-acid 
peptide (3.5 kd) derived from a large precursor, pre-
proglucagon, encoded by a gene present on chromo-
some 2.  In addition to the pancreas, glucagon can be 

found in the  gastrointestinal tract (enteroglucagon) 
and brain. About 30% to 40% of glucagon in blood 
derives from the pancreas; the remainder comes from 
the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Circulating  glucagon,  of 
pancreatic and gastrointestinal origin, is transported 
to the liver and about 80% is degraded before reaching 
the systemic circulation. The liver is the primary target 
site of glucagon. Glucagon induces hyperglycemia by 
its glycogenolytic activity in hepatocytes. 

Neither C peptide nor zinc is present in glucagon-

containing secretory granules. 

The actions of glucagon are antagonistic to those 
of insulin. The secretion of glucagon is stimulated by:
1. A fall in the concentration of glucose in blood.
2. An increase of arginine and alanine in serum.
3. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.
D ((cid:98)(cid:9) cells produce gastrin (see discussion of en-
teroendocrine cells in Chapter 15, Upper Digestive 
Segment) and somatostatin.  Somatostatin is a 14 
amino-acid  peptide  identical  to  somatostatin  pro-
duced in the hypothalamus. Somatostatin  inhibits 
the release of insulin and glucagon in a paracrine 
manner.

Somatostatin  also  inhibits  the  secretion  of  HCl 
by parietal cells of the fundic stomach, the release of 
gastrin from enteroendocrine cells, the secretion of 
pancreatic bicarbonate and enzymes, and the contrac-
tion of the gallbladder. Somatostatin is also produced 
in  the  hypothalamus  and  inhibits  the  secretion  of 
growth hormone from the anterior hypophysis.

 Pancreatic polypeptide is a 36-amino-acid peptide 
that inhibits the secretion of somatostatin. Pancreatic 
polypeptide also inhibits the secretion of pancreatic 
enzymes and blocks the secretion of bile by inhibit-
ing contraction of the gallbladder.  Its function is to 
conserve digestive enzymes and bile between meals. 
Cholecystokinin stimulates the release of pancreatic 

polypeptide. 

Cell types in the islets of Langerhans can be identi-

ﬁed by:

1. Immunocytochemistry, using antibodies speciﬁc 

for each cell product.

2. Electron microscopy, to distinguish the size and 

structure of the secretory granules.

3. The  cell  distribution  in  the  islet.  B  cells  are 
centrally located (core distribution) and surrounded 
by the other cell types (mantle distribution; see Figure 
19-16).

Clinical signiﬁcance: ATP-sensitive K+ channel and 
insulin secretion 
The  ATP-sensitive  potassium  (KATP)  channel,  a 
complex of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and 
the inward-rectifying K+ channel (Kir6.2) subunits, 
are the key regulators of insulin release. 

SUR1  is  encoded  by  the  KCNJ11  (potassium 
channel J member 11) gene. Kir6.2 is encoded by

Figure 19-18. Adipose cell, lipid storage, and insulin

Mechanism of action of insulin in an adipose cell 

       Insulin binds to the (cid:95) subunit of the insulin 
1
receptor and activates the autophosphorylation    
(Tyr-P) of the adjacent (cid:96) subunit (a tyrosine kinase).

       An activated insulin receptor stimulates DNA 
2
synthesis, protein synthesis, and the translocation of 
insulin-dependent glucose transporter protein-4 
(GLUT-4) from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma 
membrane.

       GLUT-4 translocation facilitates the cellular

uptake of glucose.

       This mechanism demonstrates that, in diabetic

individuals, a lack of insulin decreases the utilization 
of glucose in target cells.

When glucose is taken up by B cells by GLUT-2, 

the KATP channel closes utilizing ATP derived from 
glucose metabolism.  K+ accumulates in the cell, the 
Ca2+  channel  opens  by  membrane  depolarization, 
and the inﬂux of Ca2+ triggers insulin exocytosis (see

Individuals with IDDM require exogenous 
insulin to maintain life because there is

   Pancreatic B cells are damaged by the 
actions of cytokines and autoantibodies 
produced by inflammatory cells.
   Patients with IDDM are susceptible to 
ketosis.
   Although 90% of the cases of IDDM 
begin in childhood (juvenile diabetes), it 
can develop at any time of life.

Individuals with NIDDM have defective 
insulin secretion and action, two 
conditions leading to:
  1. Hyperglycemia due to impaired 
glucose uptake and unregulated 
production of glucose in hepatocytes.
  2. Dyslipidemia, altered homeostasis 
of fatty acids, triglycerides, and 
lipoproteins.
Increases in circulating glucose and 
lipid levels can further affect insulin 
secretion and action.

Mechanisms of insulin resistance

Adipose cells produce adipokines (hormones 
and cytokines) that regulate the development of 
insulin resistance.
  The capacity of adipose cells to store excess 
lipids is saturated in obesity and in response to 
high–fat diets. Lipids are redistributed to skeletal 
muscle, heart and liver, thus contributing to 
insulin resistance.
  Muscle insulin resistance is linked to 
mitochondrial dysfunction causing incomplete fat 
oxidation.

blood vessels leads to myocardial and

lower extremities. Arteriolosclerosis 
(thickening of the wall of the arterioles)

observed.

Glomerulosclerosis,

seen kidney diseases in diabetic 
patients.  The most significant 
damage to the kidneys is the

    This glomerular change is 
known as the Kimmelstiel-

cause KATP channels to remain open, thereby decreas-
ing insulin secretion and leading to neonatal diabetes 
mellitus. Loss-of-function mutations of SUR1 and 
Kir6.2 genes cause KATP channels to remain closed, 
thereby  causing  unregulated  secretion  of  insulin 
leading to neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.   
 
Clinical signiﬁcance: Insulin and diabetes
When blood glucose levels rise in a normal person, 
the immediate release of insulin ensures a return to 
normal levels within 1 hour. In a diabetic individual, 
increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) re-
main high for a prolonged period of time. 

The glycated hemoglobin test, also called hemo-
globin  A1c  (HbA1c)  test,  provides  an  average  of  
blood  glucose  measurements  over  a  6  to  12  week 
period. When blood glucose levels are high, the sugar 
combines  with  hemoglobin  that  becomes  glycated 
(coated). The HbA1c test range in normal individuals 
is between 4% and 5.6%. Individuals with diabetes 
should have a HbA1c level less of 6.5%.

Hyperglycemia can be the result of the following 

(see Figure 19-18): 

1. A  lack of insulin, caused by autoimmune, toxic, 
or viral damage to B cells (type 1 diabetes mellitus; 
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  [IDDM]).  
Insulinitis  with  an  inﬁltration  of  lymphocytes  is 
characteristic of the early stages of IDDM. This type 
of diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, accounts 

for about 90% of cases and often occurs before the age 
of 25 years (between 10 and 14). However, IDDM 
can occur at any age.

2. Insufﬁcient insulin secretion relative to glucose 
levels  and  resistance  of  peripheral  target  tissues 
to insulin (type 2 diabetes mellitus; non–insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]).

3. The association between excess lipid storage in 
the form of obesity and insulin resistance. Following 
carbohydrate ingestion, glucose is deposited in muscle 
and the liver as glycogen. Defective insulin responsive-
ness in these organs result in fasting hyperglycemia 
The lack of responsiveness to insulin by target cells 
can be caused by a decrease in the number of available 
insulin receptors in the target cells and deﬁciency in 
postreceptor signaling (for example,  the translocation 
of GLUT-4 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma 
membrane to facilitate glucose uptake). This latter 
type of defect is most frequent (80%) and is observed 
in the adult. 

The symptoms and consequences of type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes are generally similar. Hyperglycemia, 
polyuria  (increased  frequency  of  micturition  and 
urine  volume),  and  polydipsia  (sensation  of  thirst 
and increased ﬂuid intake) are the three characteristic 
symptoms. 

The clinical forms of diabetes mellitus are presented 
in Figure 19-19. The late complications of diabetes 
mellitus are summarized in Figure 19-20.

Essential concepts

Endocrine System

• Thyroid gland. The thyroid gland develops 
from an endodermal downgrowth at the base 
of the tongue, connected by the thyroglossal 
duct. C cells, derived from the neural crest, are 
present in the thyroid gland.

  The thyroid gland consists of thyroid fol-
licles lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium, 
whose height varies with functional activity. 
The lumen contains a colloid substance rich 
in thyroglobulin, the precursor of the thyroid 
hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine 
(T4). The main function of thyroid hormones is 
the regulation of the body’s basal metabolism.
  The synthesis and secretion of thyroid hor-
mones involve two phases: 
  (1) An excretory phase.
  (2) An endocrine phase. 
  Both phases can occur in the same thyroid 
cell and are regulated by thyroid stimulating 
hormone (TSH), produced by basophil cells in 
the anterior hypophysis. 
  The exocrine phase consists of the synthesis 
and secretion of thyroglobulin into the colloid-
containing lumen and the uptake of inorganic 
iodide from blood through an ATP-dependent 
iodide pump. The enzyme thyroid peroxidase, 
present in the membrane of the secretory 
vesicle, which also contains thyroglobulin, 
converts iodide into iodine. Iodine atoms are 

attached to tyrosil residues on thyroglobulin, 
which become iodothyroglobulin. 
  The endocrine phase consists of the reuptake 
and processing of iodothyroglobulin. Colloid 
droplets, containing iodothyroglobulin, are 
enveloped by pseudopods and internalized to 
become colloid-containing vesicles. Lysosomes 
fuse with the internalized vesicles and iodo-
thyroglobulin is processed to release T3 and 
T4 across the basal domain of the thyroid cell 
into the bloodstream. T3 and T4 are trans-
ported in the blood by serum carrier proteins. 
Thyroid hormones enter the cell nucleus of a 
target cell, and bind to the thyroid hormone–
responsive element to activate speciﬁc gene 
expression. 

• Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disease 
that causes hyperfunction of the thyroid gland 
(hyperthyroidism). Autoantibodies against 
the TSH receptor stimulate the unregulated 
function of the thyroid gland. Patients have 
an enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter), 
bulging eyes (exophthalmos), and accelerated 
heart rate (tachycardia). 
  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune 
disease associated with hypofunction of the 
thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). It is caused 
by autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (anti-
TPO) and thyroglobulin (anti-TG).

  Additional inﬂammatory conditions of 
the thyroid gland includes de Quervain’s 
thyroiditis (a subacute inﬂammatory process 
seen during systemic viral illness) and Riedel’s 
thyroiditis (inﬂammatory ﬁbrosclerosis). 
  Papillary carcinoma is the most frequent 
malignant tumor of the thyroid gland. This 
tumor is locally invasive and spreads to cervi-
cal lymph nodes.  Follicular carcinoma, is the 
second most frequent tumor of the thyroid 
gland. It is a slow growing tumor that usually 
spreads to bone by the hematogenous route

• Ca2+ regulation. The maintenance of Ca2+ 
levels in blood is regulated by 
  (1) Parathyroid hormone.
  (2) Calcitonin.
  (3) Vitamin D.
  Parathyroid gland. The four parathyroid 
glands derive from the third and fourth bran-
chial pouches. The parathyroid gland consists 
of two cell populations arranged in cords or 
clusters: 
  (1) Chief or principal cells, producing para-
thyroid hormone.
  (2) Oxyphil cells, presumably a transitional 
chief cell. Chief cells secrete parathyroid 
hormone. 
  A Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the 
plasma membrane of chief cells detects Ca2+

3- balance by acting on: 

concentration in serum. When Ca2+ levels go 
down, the secretion of parathyroid hormone is 
stimulated. Parathyroid hormone regulates the 
Ca2+ and PO4
  (1) The bone tissue, stimulating the function 
of osteoclasts.
  (2) The uriniferous tubule, by stimulating the 
resorption of Ca2+ by osteoclasts and activating 
the production of vitamin D. 
  Parathyroid hormone induces the produc-
tion of proteins in osteoblasts, which stimulate 
osteoclastogenesis. Proteins produced by 
osteoblasts and involved in osteoclastogenesis 
are macrophage-colony stimulating factor, 
RANKL, and osteoprotegerin.

• Hyperparathyroidism is caused by an 
adenoma (benign tumor) of the parathyroid 
gland. Excessive secretion of parathyroid 
hormone causes hypercalcemia, phosphaturia, 
and hypercalciuria. Complications include the 
formation of renal stones  and bone cysts 
caused by excessive removal of mineralized 
bone. Inactivating mutations of CaSR  cause 
familial benign hypercalcemia. Activating 
mutations of CaSR result in idiopathic hypo-
parathyroidism.

  C cells, present in the lining of the thyroid 
follicle, produce calcitonin, which antagonizes 
the effects of parathyroid hormone.

  Vitamin D. Cholecalciferol is formed in the 
skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Before reach-
ing its active form, cholecalciferol undergoes 
two hydroxylation steps, ﬁrst in the liver 
(25-hydroxycholecalciferol) and the second in 
the kidneys. 
  Low Ca2+ levels stimulate 1(cid:95)-hydroxylase to 
convert 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into calcitriol, 
the active form of vitamin D. The main func-
tion of vitamin D (calcitriol) is to stimulate 
the absorption of calcium by the intestinal 
mucosa.    
  Calcitriol is transported to the small intestine 
through the bloodstream, bound to vita-
min D–binding protein. In the duodenum, 
calcitriol is taken up by enterocytes, which are 
stimulated by vitamin D to produce calbindin, 
a calcium-binding protein. 
  Calcium is absorbed in the duodenum by 
transcellular absorption, an active process that 
requires calbindin (for transcellular transport), 
and a voltage-insensitive channel controlled by 
calcium-ATPase (for export to the blood-
stream). Calcium is absorbed in the jejunum 
and ileum by a passive paracellular absorption 
mechanism.
  In children, a deﬁciency of vitamin D causes 
rickets. In adults, it causes osteomalacia.

• Adrenal (suprarenal) gland. The adrenal 
glands develop from two separate embryologic 
tissues:
  (1) The neural crest ectoderm.
  (2) The mesoderm. 
  Cells from the celomic epithelium aggregate 
on each side, between the developing gonads 
and the dorsal mesentery, to form the fetal 
cortex. 

  The medulla originates from neural crest cells 
migrating from the adjacent sympathetic gan-
glia into the medial region of the fetal cortex.
  A layer of mesodermic cells surrounds the 
fetal cortex to form the precursor of the adult 
adrenal cortex.
  Mesenchymal cells surround each developing 
adrenal gland and differentiate into ﬁbroblasts 
that form the perirenal fascia and capsule.  
  At birth, the adrenal glands are 20 times 
relatively larger than they are in the adult. The 
zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata are present.  
The zona reticularis is not apparent.  
  By the third month after birth, the celomic-
derive fetal cortex regresses and disappears 
within the ﬁrst year of life. The mesoderm-
derived adrenal cortex precursor, consisting of 
the zona glomerulosa and the zona fasciculata, 
remains as the deﬁnitive cortex. The zona retic-
ularis develops by the end of the third year. 
 During the early stage of gestation, the 
fetal adrenal cortex synthesizes dehydro-
epiandrosterone, a precursor of the synthe-
sis of estrogen by the placenta. A lack of 
3(cid:96)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity 
prevents the synthesis of progesterone, gluco-
corticoids, and androstenedione.  
  The interaction between the fetal adrenal cor-
tex and the placenta constitutes the fetopla-
cental unit.
  Glucocorticoids, either of maternal origin or 
synthesized from placental progesterone by 
the fetus, are essential for: 
  (1) The production of surfactant by type II al-
veolar cells after the eighth month of fetal life.
  (2) The development of a functional hypo-
thalamopituitary axis.
  (3) The induction of thymic involution.
  The adrenal gland consists of two compo-
nents: 
  (1) The adrenal cortex, derived from the 
mesoderm.
  (2) The adrenal medulla, derived from neural 
crest cells. 
   The fetal adrenal cortex plays an important 
role during early gestation: it synthesizes 
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor 
for the synthesis of estrogen by the placenta. 
This interaction is known as the fetoplacental 
unit. After the eighth month of gestation, 
glucocorticoids are essential for the production 
of surfactant by type II alveolar cells.
  The adrenal cortex consists of three zones: 
  (1) The outermost, subcapsular zona 
glomerulosa, which produces the mineralocor-
ticoid aldosterone.
  (2) The middle layer of the zona fascicu-
lata, which produces glucocorticoids, mainly 
cortisol.
  (3) The inner layer of the zona reticularis, 
which synthesizes the androgens  DHEA  and 
androstenedione. The function of the zona 
glomerulosa is controlled by angiotensin II 
(ANG II), and the functions of the zona 
fasciculata and zona reticularis are regulated by 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
   The signiﬁcant structural characteristics 
of steroid-producing cells are lipid droplets 
(containing cholesterol), mitochondria with 

tubular cristae (housing the enzymes involved 
in steroidogenesis), and smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum cisternae (also containing mem-
brane-associated enzymes involved in the 
production of steroids). 

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia results 
from a genetic enzymatic defect in the 
synthesis of cortisol. The adrenal cortex is 
responsive to ACTH and the adrenal cortex 
enlarges (adrenal hyperplasia). 

  Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is 
caused by a mutation in the gene encoding 
steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 
a protein that transports cholesterol across the 
outer mitochondrial membrane. The synthesis 
of adrenal and gonadal steroids is affected.
  Primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn’s 
syndrome is caused by a tumor in the 
zona glomerulosa that produces excessive 
aldosterone.
  Cushing’s disease is caused by an ACTH-
producing tumor of the anterior hypophysis, 
resulting in an increased production of cortical 
steroids. Cushing’s syndrome is caused 
by a functional tumor of the adrenal cortex, 
resulting in the overproduction of aldosterone, 
glucocorticoids, and androgens.
  Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, seen 
in infants, is the acute destruction of the adre-
nal gland by meningococcal septicemia.
  Addison’s disease is the chronic destruc-
tion of the adrenal cortex by an autoimmune 
process or tuberculosis.

• The adrenal medulla consists of two cell 
populations of chromafﬁn, catecholamine-
producing cells or modiﬁed sympathetic 
postganglionic neurons: 
  (1) Epinephrine-producing cells (80%).
  (2) Norepinephrine-producing cells (20%). 
   Epinephrine is stored in granules with 
a dense eccentric core; norepinephrine-
containing granules are smaller and occupy 
a less dense central core than epinephrine-
containing granules. 
  The synthesis of catecholamines includes 
the following steps: 
  (1) Tyrosine is converted to DOPA,
  (2) DOPA is converted to dopamine, which 
changes into norepinephrine stored in a 
vesicle in the form of an eccentric granule.
  (3) Norepinephrine leaves the granule, 
enters the cytosol, and becomes epinephrine 
under the inﬂuence of phenylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase (PNMT). 
  (4) The synthesis of PNMT is stimulated by 
glucocorticoids arriving in the adrenal medulla 
from the zona fasciculata. 
  (5) Epinephrine enters a vesicle and forms a 
complex with chromogranins, and is released 
into fenestrated capillaries following stimula-
tion by a cholinergic axon from a pregangli-
onic sympathetic neuron in the presence of 
calcium. 
  In contrast to the adrenal medulla, cells 
of the adrenal cortex do not store steroid 
hormones in granules. Vanillylmandelic acid 
and metanephrine are metabolic products

of catecholamines. They are used clinically to 
determine the production level of catechol-
amines.

  Adrenal pheochromocytoma (or adrenal 
medullary paraganglioma) is a rare neoplasm 
that arises from the chromafﬁn cells. Pheo-
chromocytoma causes sustained or episodic 
hypertension, tachycardia, and tremor. The 
gross appearance of a pheochromocytoma 
is a hemorrhagic mass. Microscopically, the 
tumor displays a cluster and/or a trabecular 
pattern surrounded by an abundant sinusoidal-
capillary network. Chromogranins are markers 
for pheochromocytoma.

• The adrenal medulla has a dual blood 
supply:  
  (1) Blood vessels from the  capsular plexus 
supply the three zones of the cortex. Fenes-
trated capillaries (called sinusoids) percolate 
between cells of the zona glomerulosa and 
zona fasciculata, and form a capillary network 
in the zona reticularis before entering the me-
dulla.  Medullary sinuses collect aldosterone, 
cortisol, and sexual steroids, which are drained 
by the central vein of the medulla. 
  (2) The medullary artery (derived from the 
inferior adrenal artery) enters the cortex and 
supplies blood only to the medulla without 
branching in the adrenal cortex. 
  There are no veins or lymphatics in the 
adrenal cortex.

• Endocrine pancreas. The pancreas has two 
portions: 

  (1) The exocrine pancreas, consisting of 
acini involved in the production of enzymes 
transported to the duodenum.
  (2) The endocrine pancreas or islets of 
Langerhans.
  The islets of Langerhans are formed by two 
components: 
  (1) The endocrine cells A ((cid:95) cells), B ((cid:96)(cid:3)
cells), D ((cid:98) cells), and F cells, each secreting a 
single hormone.
  (2) A vascular component, the insuloacinar 
portal system, which enables a local action of 
insular hormone on the exocrine pancreas.
  A cells secrete glucagon (which increases 
glucose blood levels).
  B cells secrete insulin (which increases the 
transport of glucose into cells; such as hepato-
cytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells).
  D cells secrete gastrin (which stimulates pro-
duction of HCl by parietal cells in the stomach) 
and somatostatin (which inhibits the release of 
insulin and glucagon, and the secretion of HCl 
by parietal cells).
  F cells produce pancreatic polypeptide 
(which inhibits the secretion of somatostatin 
and the secretion of pancreatic enzymes). 

   The secretion of insulin is stimulated by an 
inﬂux of Ca2+ into B cells through voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ inﬂux occurs when 
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ 
channel (KATP) closes and K+ accumulates in 
the cytosol. 
  Mutations in the sulfonyurea receptor (Sur1) 
gene and the inward rectifying K+ chan-
nel (Kir6.2) gene, components of the KATP 

channel, are seen in patients with neonatal 
diabetes mellitus.

• Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, 
polyuria, and polydipsia. 
  The glycated hemoglobin test, also called 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, provides an 
average of  blood glucose measurements 
over a 6 to 12 week period. When blood glu-
cose levels are high, the sugar combines with 
hemoglobin that becomes glycated (coated). 
  The HbA1c test range in normal individuals 
is between 4% and 5.6%. Individuals with 
diabetes should have HbA1c less of 6.5%.
   Type 1 diabetes (also known as juvenile 
diabetes) is determined by autoimmunity, 
viral infection, and chemical toxins affecting 
insulin-producing B cells. There is a lack of 
insulin in type I diabetes. 
   Type 2 diabetes is caused by a genetic 
predisposition. The levels of insulin are insuf-
ﬁcient relative to glucose levels. In addition, 
tissues decrease responsiveness to insulin 
(insulin resistance). 
  Chronic diabetes affects the vascular system. 
Atherosclerosis of the aorta and large and 
medium-sized blood vessels leads to myocar-
dial and brain infarctions and gangrene of the 
lower extremities. Capillaries are also affected. 
Retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma can 
cause total blindness. 
  Glomerulopathy (Kimmelstiel-Wilson le-
sion), consists of thickening of the glomerular 
basal lamina of glomerular capillaries, and 
proliferation of mesangial cells that affects 
glomerular ﬁltration of the kidneys.

PART VI  |  ORGAN SYSTEMS | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 

20. Spermatogenesis

The male reproductive system is responsible for (1) the continuous production, nourishment, and temporary 
storage of the haploid male gamete (spermatozoa [sing. spermatozoon], or sperm); and (2) the synthesis and 
secretion of male sex  hormones (androgens). The male reproductive system consists of (1) the testes, which 
produce sperm and synthesize and secrete androgens; (2) the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and a 
segment of the male urethra, which form the excurrent duct  system responsible for the transport of spermatozoa 
to the exterior; (3) accessory glands, the  seminal vesicle, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral glands of 
Cowper, whose secretions form the bulk of the semen and provide nutrients to ejaculated spermatozoa; and 
(4) the penis, the copulatory organ, formed of erectile tissue. The testes, epididymis, and the initial part of the 
vas deferens are located in the scrotal sac, a skin-covered pouch enclosing a mesothelium-lined cavity—the 
tunica vaginalis. This chapter is focused on structural and functional aspects of sperm development, pathologic 
conditions related to male infertility, genomic imprinting, and testicular tumors.

The testes
The testes are paired organs located in the scrotum, 
outside the abdominal cavity. This location enables 
maintenance of the testes at a temperature 2oC to 3oC 
below body temperature. A temperature of 34oC to 
35oC is essential for normal spermatogenesis.

The posterior surface of the mature testes is associ-
ated with the epididymis. Both testes and epididymis 
are suspended in the scrotal sac by the spermatic cord, 
which contains the vas deferens, the spermatic artery, 

and the venous and lymphatic plexuses.

Each  testis  is  enclosed  by  the  tunica  albuginea, 
which is thickened to form the mediastinum where 
the rete testis is located (Figure 20-1). Fibrous septa 
from the mediastinum project into the testicular mass, 
dividing  the  tissue  into  250  to  300  lobules.  Each 
lobule contains one to four seminiferous tubules.

Each seminiferous tubule is about 150 (cid:43)m in di-
ameter and 80 cm long; it is U-shaped with the two 
ends opening in the rete testis. The rete testis is a

Organization of the testes

Figure 20-3. General histologic structure of the testes

Clusters of Leydig cells are present 
in the intertubular space. Leydig cells 
are in close contact with blood 
vessels and lymphatic channels. The 
major product of Leydig cells is 
testosterone.

The wall of the seminiferous 
tubule consists of peritubular 
myoid cells separated from the 
seminiferous epithelium by a 
basement membrane.

The lumen of a seminiferous 
tubule displays the free ends of the 
tails of developing spermatids. Fluid 
and secretory proteins from Sertoli 
cells are also found in the lumen.

Periodic acid–Schiff staining 
detects glycoproteins in the 
developing acrosome of spermatids 
adjacent to the lumen of the 
seminiferous tubule.

Although variations are observed in the cellular composition of the 
seminiferous epithelium, reflecting both synchrony and overlap of 
spermatogenic cell progenies during their development, Sertoli 
cells are the permanent somatic components of the epithelium. 

Sertoli cells: 
1. Maintain a close relationship with spermatogonia, primary and 
secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids. 
2. Are postmitotic in the adult testis.

network of channels that collects the products of the 
seminiferous epithelium (testicular sperm, secretory 
proteins, ﬂuid, and ions).

The seminiferous tubule (Figure 20-2) consists of 
a central lumen lined by a specialized seminiferous 
epithelium containing two distinct cell populations:  

1. The somatic Sertoli cells.
2. The spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, sper-

matocytes, and spermatids). 

The seminiferous epithelium is encircled by a base-
ment membrane and a wall formed by collagenous 
ﬁbers, ﬁbroblasts, and contractile myoid cells. My-
oid cells are responsible for the rhythmic contractile 
activity that propels the nonmotile sperm to the rete 
testis. Sperm acquire forward motility after they have 
passed through the epididymal duct.

The space in between the seminiferous tubules is 
occupied by abundant blood vessels (arterioles, capil-
laries, and venules) and aggregates of the androgen-
producing Leydig cells. Lymphatic channels, in close 
proximity to Leydig cells, encircle each seminiferous 
tubule (see Figure 20-2). 

We initiate this chapter by describing the histology 
of the testes seen with light microscopy (Figures 20-3 
and 20-4) and electron microscopy (Figure 20-5).

Seminiferous epithelium
The  seminiferous  epithelium  can  be  classiﬁed  as  a 
stratiﬁed epithelium with rather unusual characteris-
tics not found in any stratiﬁed epithelium of the body.
In  this  stratiﬁed  epithelium,  somatic  columnar 
Sertoli cells interact with  mitotically dividing sper-
matogonia, meiotically dividing spermatocytes, and 
a  haploid  population  of  spermatids  undergoing  a 
differentiation process called spermiogenesis. 

Figure  20-3  illustrates  several  cross  sections  of 
seminiferous tubules. Note that irregular arrangement 
of seminiferous tubules generates different proﬁles in 
the sections. 

A more detailed view of the seminiferous epithe-
lium is seen in Figure 20-4. Different structural types 
of nuclei can be appreciated:

1. The nuclei of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells are 

closely associated to the seminiferous tubular wall.

2. Overlying the spermatogonial cell population 
are  the  primary  spermatocytes. Their  nuclei  are 
larger and clumps of chromatin represent the meiotic 
chromosomes. 

3. Close to the lumen are the early spermatids with 
a round light nucleus and the late spermatids with a 
cylindrical-shaped condensed nuclei.

the  basal  lamina  and  ﬁbrillar  components  of  the 
seminiferous tubular wall and the nuclear character-
istics of two Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, and primary 
spermatocytes. Note how Sertoli cell processes extend 
between the spermatogenic cells. 

The next step is to provide additional information 
to help understand why each cell progeny occupies a 
speciﬁc space in the seminiferous epithelium  

The  basal  and  adluminal  compartments  of  the 
seminiferous epithelium    
Sertoli cells are columnar cells extending from the 
basal lamina to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule 

(see Figures 20-2 and 20-5). They act as bridge cells 
between the intertubular space and the lumen of the 
seminiferous tubule and as nurse cells, supporting 
spermatogenic cell survival.   

The apical and lateral plasma membranes of Sertoli 
cells have an irregular outline because they provide 
niches and crypts to house the developing spermato-
genic cells (Figure 20-6). 

At their basolateral domain, Sertoli cells form tight 
junctions with adjoining Sertoli cells. Most epithelia 
have tight junctions at the apical domain. Therefore, 
tight junctions at the basolateral domain of Sertoli 
cells represents an exception to the rule.

Sertoli cells display a columnar shape, with the cytoplasm extending 
like a bridge from the lumen to the basal lamina of the seminiferous 
epithelium and cytoplasmic processes enveloping adjacent 
spermatogenic cells, forming niches.The irregularly shaped nucleus, 
with a prominent nucleolus and associated heterochromatin masses, is 
observed in the basal portion of the cell.  Lipid droplets are present. 
   Spermatogonia are in contact with the basal lamina. In human 
testes, spermatogonia A include two subtypes based on the nuclear 
appearance (not shown): (1) spermatogonium A pale (Apale) and (2) 
spermatogonium A dark (Adark).

    Spermatocytes are located above the blood-testis barrier, 
represented by inter–Sertoli cell tight junctions. Most spermatocytes 
are primary spermatocytes. They are recognized by three specific 
features, depending on the stage of meiotic prophase I: (1) a 
condensed chromatin mass adjacent to the nuclear envelope, 
corresponding to the XY chromosome pair (see Figure 20-4); (2) 
nucleolar masses originated in several autosomal bivalents, and (3) 
sections of the synaptonemal complex, connecting homologous 
chromosomes in preparation for crossing-over events.
    The tubular wall is thick. It consists of three to five layers of myoid 
cells, fibroblasts and adjacent collagen and elastic fibers.

Figure 20-6. Two compartments of the seminiferous epithelium

The Sertoli cell spans from the seminiferous tubular wall to 
the lumen and has cell-cell contacts with all proliferating 
and differentiating spermatogenic cells. 
  The cytoplasm of Sertoli cells encloses (1) 
spermatogonial niches in the basal compartment, between 
themselves and the basal lamina; (2) spermatocytes and 
early spermatids, in adluminal niches between adjacent 
Sertoli cells; and (3) late spermatids, in crypts at the 
luminal surfaces of Sertoli cells.

Basal tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells form the blood-testis 
barrier. The barrier prevents proteins, including antibodies, from reaching 
developing spermatogenic cells. 
   In an opposite direction, the barrier prevents proteins in developing 
spermatogenic cells from leaking and triggering an immune response.  
  Tight junctions divide the seminiferous epithelium into a basal 
compartment, below the junctions, and an adluminal compartment, above 
the junctions.  Spermatogonia are located in the basal compartment and 
spermatocytes and spermatids occupy the adluminal compartment.

dard epithelium follow the apical-to-basal transport 
direction across tight junctions, in the seminiferous 
tubules the transporting direction is reversed: basal-
to-apical. In fact, the source of ﬂuid and nutrients 
is not in the luminal space but rather in the inter-
seminiferous tubular space.

Basolateral tight junctions subdivide the seminifer-

ous epithelium into:

1. A basal compartment.
2. An adluminal compartment (see Figure 20-4). 
Note that:
•  The spermatogonial cell population is housed in  
niches within the basal compartment. This location 
has ample access to nutrients and signaling molecules 
derived from vessels in the inter-seminiferous tubular 
space.

•  Inter-Sertoli  tight  junctions  are  components 
of  the  so-called  blood-testes  barrier. This  barrier 
protects developing spermatocytes and spermatids, 
located  within  the  adluminal  compartment,  from 
autoimmune reactions.

The spermatogenic cell sequence
The basic concepts to remember are:

•  Somatic Sertoli cells represent the stable mem-

bers of the seminiferous tubule cell population. 

•  The spermatogenic cell progenies are transient.
Figure 20-7 illustrates relevant aspects of a mam-

malian spermatogenic cell sequence. 

1. At puberty, a spermatogonial stem cell (SSC), 
derived from a primordial germinal cell in the fetal 
testes, divides by mitosis to generate two daughter 
cells. One daughter cell initiates a spermatogenic 
cell sequence. The other cell becomes a SSC with 
self-renewal capacity and able to soon initiate an-
other spermatogenic cell sequence.  We have seen 
in  Chapter  3,  Cell  Signaling,  that  stem  cells  can 
self-renew and give rise to another stem cell and a 
cell entering a terminal differentiation pathway. The 
same rule applies to SSCs.

2. After cell division, all spermatogenic cells re-
main interconnected by intercellular bridges because 
cytokinesis is incomplete.

3. Spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids 
complete their proliferation and differentiation se-
quence in a timely manner. 

Each spermatogenic cell cohort proliferates and 

differentiates synchronously.

4.  SSCs  periodically  initiate  spermatogenic  cell 
series to ensure the continuous production of sperm. 
We  will  study  later  how  spermatogenic  cell  cycles 
overlap in a segment of a seminiferous tubule and 
generate distinct combinations of spermatogenic cell 
cohorts called cellular associations.

Now that you have been exposed to the basic as-
pects of the organization of a mammalian testis, the 

next step is to understand how the different spermato-
genic cells types are distributed in the seminiferous 
epithelium with respect to the Sertoli cell. 

Sertoli cells
Sertoli  cells  are  the  predominant  cell  type  of  the 
seminiferous epithelium until puberty. After puberty, 
they  represent  about  10%  of  the  cells  lining  the 
seminiferous  tubules.  Sertoli  cells  are  postmitotic 
after puberty. No mitotic cell division is observed in 
the adult testes. In elderly men, when the population 
of spermatogenic cells decreases, Sertoli cells again 
become the major component of the epithelium.

The cytoskeleton of Sertoli cells (microtubules, 
actin microﬁlaments, and the intermediate ﬁlament 
vimentin)  facilitates  the  displacement  of  differen-
tiating  spermatogenic  cells  farther  away  from  the 
periphery of the seminiferous tubule and closer to 
the lumen. 

Members  of  the  spermatogonia  progeny,  inter-
connected  by  intercellular  bridges,  complete  the 
mitotic ampliﬁcation cycle, translocate from the basal 
compartment to the adluminal compartment, and  
initiate the meiotic cycle as primary spermatocytes. 
Inter-Sertoli tight junctions unzip and re-zip to en-
able the massive migration of interconnected cells.

How can Sertoli cells be identiﬁed in a histology 

preparation? 

The  most  useful  parameter  is  the  Sertoli  cell 
nucleus. The cytoplasmic processes of a Sertoli cell 
are tortuous and difﬁcult to resolve with the light 
microscope.

The Sertoli cell nucleus is located at the base of the 
cell, near the basal lamina. It displays indentations 
and a large nucleolus with associated heterochroma-
tin masses (see Figures 20-5 and 20-6). 

The cytoplasm contains smooth and rough endo-
plasmic  reticulum,  mitochondria,  lysosomes,  lipid 
droplets,  an  extensive  Golgi  apparatus,  and  a  rich 
cytoskeleton.  

The functions of Sertoli cells are:
1. To  support,  protect,  and  nourish  developing 

spermatogenic cells.

2. To eliminate by phagocytosis excess cell por-
tions, called residual bodies, discarded by spermatids 
at the end of spermiogenesis.

3. To  facilitate  the  release  of  mature  spermatids 
into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule by actin-
mediated contraction, a process called spermiation.
4. To secrete a ﬂuid rich in proteins, lactate, and 

ions into the seminiferous tubular lumen.

Sertoli cells respond to follicle-stimulating hor-
mone  (FSH)  stimulation  and  express  androgen 
receptors.    Androgens  acting  through  Sertoli  cells 
stimulate spermatogenesis by a still undeﬁned mecha-
nism  (see  Box  20-A).  FSH  regulates  the  synthesis

The spermatogenic cell sequence: Highlights to remember

Spermatogenesis starts at puberty when spermatogonial stem 
cells (SSC) derived from primordial germinal cells (PGCs) 
undergo mitotic cell division to produce two daughter cells. One 
daughter cell remains as a SSC; the other initiates a mitotic 
amplification and differentiation sequence giving rise to 
morphologically distinct spermatogonia type A and type B. 
    Type B spermatogonia complete the S phase (DNA synthesis) of 
their cell cycle and advance to G2. Instead of undergoing mitotic 
cell division, they translocate to the adluminal compartment and 
initiate meiosis I.  
    A characteristic feature of spermatogenesis is incomplete 

cytokinesis. Cells are conjoined to each other by cytoplasmic 
bridges, a condition that persists until the completion of 
spermatogenesis. 
    Another typical aspect of spermatogenesis is cell cycle 
synchrony (see image inset). All the cells initiate, progress, and 
complete a differentiation sequence in a coordinated manner.  
    The conjoined condition terminates when mature spermatids are 
released at the end of spermiogenesis by the process of 
spermiation. Residual bodies, linked by cytoplasmic bridges, 
separate from the spermatids and are phagocytosed by Sertoli cells. 
Mature spermatids become single cells transported to the rete 
testis.

izing homone (LH) stimulation, is released into peripheral blood and lymphatic 
channels encircling seminiferous tubules and diffuses into the seminiferous 
epithelium. Testosterone levels in the testes are about 25–125-fold higher than 
in serum. Only one-third of testosterone is bound to androgen binding protein 
(ABP), a secretory product of Sertoli cells.
•  Testosterone effects are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) localized 
in the cytosol and nucleus of Sertoli cells. AR is also present in the contractile 
peritubular myoid cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. No functional AR has 
been found in spermatogenic cells. 
• In humans, AR in Sertoli cells is detected at the age of 5 months and AR 
gene expression in Sertoli cells is cyclical  (dependent on the stages of the 
spermatogenic cycle; described later in this chapter).
• Testosterone is required for: (1) the maintenance of the blood-testis barrier; 
(2) the progression and completion of meiosis; (3) the adhesion of spermatids 
to Sertoli cells; and (4) release of mature spermatids (spermiation). Details of 
the molecular and cellular of some of these events regulated by testosterone 
remain to be characterized.

and secretion of androgen-binding protein (ABP). 
ABP is a secretory protein with high binding afﬁn-
ity for the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestos-
terone. The androgen-ABP complex, whose function 
is unknown at present, is transported to the proximal 
segments of the epididymis. 

We come back to this aspect later in this chapter 
and in Chapter 21, Sperm Transport and Maturation.  
Note that although both ABP and the androgen 
receptor have binding afﬁnity for androgens, they are 
distinct proteins.  ABP  is a secretory protein, whereas  
the androgen receptor is a cytoplasmic and nuclear 
protein with DNA binding activity.  

Sertoli cells secrete inhibin and activin subunits 

((cid:95) and (cid:96) subunits): 

1. Inhibin (an (cid:95)(cid:96) heterodimer) exerts a negative 
feedback on gonadotropin-releasing factor and FSH 
release by the hypothalamus and anterior hypophysis. 
2. Activin (an (cid:95)(cid:95) or (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:3)homodimer) exerts a posi-
tive feedback on the release of FSH (see Chapter 18, 
Neuroendocrine System). 

Sertoli cells also secrete regulatory proteins required 

for  spermatogonial  cell  differentiation  (discussed 
later).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Sertoli cell–only syndrome
Sertoli  cell–only  syndrome  (SCOS)  is  a  clinical 
condition deﬁned by germinal aplasia, the absence 
of  spermatogenic  cells  in  seminiferous  tubules. 
Seminiferous tubules are lined only by Sertoli cells. 
SCOS can be determined by congenital (including 
Y  chromosome  abnormalities)  or  acquired  factors 
(see Box 20-B). 

Spermatogonia
Spermatogonia are diploid spermatogenic cells resid-
ing in a unique environment, or niche, directly in 
contact with the basal lamina in the basal compart-
ment  in  association  with  Sertoli  cells  (see  Figure 
20-6). They are located below the inter–Sertoli cell 
occluding junctions and therefore outside the blood-
testes barrier. 

Two major morphologic spermatogonial cell types 

can be observed: 

1. Type A spermatogonia display an oval euchro-
matic nucleus and a nucleolus attached to the nuclear 
envelope  (see  Figure  20-6).  Subclasses  of  type  A 
spermatogonia (with a dark nucleus, called A dark 
spermatogonium, and with a lighter nucleus, called A 
pale spermatogonium) are observed in human testes.
2. Type B spermatogonia have a round nucleus, 
masses of heterochromatin attached to the nuclear 
envelope, and a central nucleolus (see Figures 20-4 
and 20-6).

Stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, 
Sertoli cells secrete GDNF (for glial cell line-derived 
neurotrophic  factor)  that  stimulates  SSC  renewal 
and differentiation by binding to the GDNF family 
receptor (cid:95)1 (GFR(cid:95)1) (Figure 20-8). 

There  is  a  balance  between  SSC  renewal  and 
spermatogonial differentiation. Maintenance of this 
balance determines an input-output equilibrium be-
tween the number of SCCs being produced (input) 

Box 20-B  |  Sertoli cell–only syndrome (SCOS)

•  Sertoli cell–only syndrome (SCOS) is also known as germinal cell aplasia or Del 
Castillo syndrome. SCOS is characterized by the presence of Sertoli cells only. Sper-
matogenic cells are absent. Leydig cells display crystals of Reinke in the cytoplasm. 
• SCOS is associated with permanent and irreversible azoospermia (no sperm are 
produced). The diagnosis is based on testicular biopsy ﬁndings.
• SCOS can be congenital or acquired. Congenital factors include a failure of 
primordial germinal cells (PGCs) to migrate to the gonadal ridges during embryonic 
development, cryptorchidism, Y chromosome abnormalities (microdeletions in the Yq11 
region of the Y chromosome, encoding the AZF, azoospermia factor), and deﬁciency 
in gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone). Acquired 
factors responsible for the loss of spermatogenic cells include radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, and severe trauma.

      Sertoli cell-derived GDNF binds to the 
2
GFR(cid:95)1 receptor on SSCs forming a binary 
complex that binds to the adjacent tyrosine 
kinase receptor, RET. GDNF binding induces 
tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET 
intracellular domains to enable binding of 
adaptor/effector proteins. This paracrine 
regulatory event initiated by Sertoli cells  
triggers a downstream cascade leading to 
spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) 
self-renewal and differentiation.  

3       In contrast, an autoregulatory event  
takes place in SSCs. It is mediated by the 
transcription factor Plzf (promyelocyte 
leukemia zinc finger) to maintain stable the 
pool of SSCs.  Plzf represses the c-kit 
tyrosine kinase receptor gene to prevent the 
differentiation of SSCs. 

        Retinoic acid (RA) down-regulates the 
4
transcription factor Plzf to enable the 
expression of c-kit receptor gene.  Then, 
Sertoli cell-derived stem cell ligand binds to 
c-kit receptor to trigger SSC differentiation.

and the number of sperm released (output).

  The transcription factor Plzf (for promyelocytic 
leukemia  zinc  ﬁnger)  deters  SSC  self-renewal  by 
blocking the gene expressing the c-kit tyrosine kinase 
receptor. 

When  SSCs  are  ready  to  start  their  self-renewal 
process, retinoic acid down-regulates the transcrip-
tion factor Plzf, thereby unblocking the expression of 
the c-kit receptor that becomes available for binding  
to the stem cell ligand. The ligand is bound to the 
plasma membrane of Sertoli cells (see Figure 20-8). 

There are two regulatory mechanisms of SSCs:
1.  A  paracrine  regulatory  mechanism  exerted 
by  the  GDNF-GFR(cid:95)1-RET  complex  and  the 
c-kit  receptor-stem  cell  ligand  complex.  By  this 
mechanism  Sertoli  cells  regulate  SSC  self-renewal 
and differentiation.

2.  An  autoregulatory  mechanism,  mediated  by 
the retinoic acid–Plzf interplay that modulates the 
expression of the c-kit gene. This mechanism deter-
mines whether SCCs undergo self-renewal.  

  SSCs    have  important  implications  for  male 
fertility. SSCs  are relatively quiescent and therefore 
resistant  to  radiation  and  cancer  chemotherapy. 
Mitotically dividing spermatogonia, meiotically di-
viding spermatocytes, and differentiating spermatids 
are sensitive to radiation and cancer chemotherapy. 
After  cessation  of  radiotherapy  or  anticancer  che-
motherapy, SSCs  can reestablish the spermatogenic 

developmental sequence. Postmitotic Sertoli cells are 
highly resistant to these therapies.

Failure of spermatogonia to undergo differentiation 
in humans results in a neoplastic transformation into 
carcinoma in situ leading to a testicular germ cell 
carcinoma in the adult.  

Spermatocytes
Type B spermatogonia enter meiotic prophase im-
mediately after completing the last S phase (DNA 
synthesis). This last round of major DNA synthetic 
activity in the lifetime of spermatogenic cells deter-
mines that a primary spermatocyte starting meiotic 
prophase I will have two times the amount of DNA 
of a spermatogonium.  The primary spermatocyte 
has a 4C DNA value, where 1C equals about 1.5 pg 
of DNA per cell.   

Spermatocytes divide by two successive meiotic cell 
divisions  (Figure 20-9) and are located in the adlu-
minal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium, 
just above the inter–Sertoli cell occluding junctions. 
Therefore,  meiosis  occurs  inside  the  blood-testes 
barrier. 

A primary spermatocyte undergoes the ﬁrst meiotic 
division (or reductional division) without  signiﬁcant 
DNA synthesis (only repair DNA synthesis occurs) 
to produce two secondary spermatocytes.

The secondary spermatocytes rapidly undergo the 
second  meiotic  division  (or  equational  division).

Each secondary spermatocyte forms two spermatids 
that mature without further cell division into sperm.
By the end of the ﬁrst meiotic division, the origi-
nal 4C DNA content of a primary spermatocyte is 
reduced to 2C in a secondary spermatocyte. By the 
end  of  the  second  meiotic  division,  the  2C  DNA 
content is reduced to 1C. The resulting spermatids 

are  the  haploid  spermatids  and  initiate  a  complex 
differentiation process called spermiogenesis.

Because the ﬁrst meiotic division is a long process 
(days) and the second meiotic division is very short 
(minutes), primary spermatocytes are the most abun-
dant cells observed in the seminiferous epithelium. 
Figure 20-10 illustrates for comparison the meiotic 
process of the female gamete that is initiated in the 
ovary  during  fetal  development  (see  Chapter  23, 
Fertilization, Placentation, and Lactation).

Meiosis
As already indicated, soon after the last mitotic divi-
sion of type B spermatogonia, the resulting daughter 
cells synthesize DNA (S phase), advance into the G2 
phase, and start the ﬁrst meiotic division with a 4C 
DNA content. The ﬁrst meiotic division is charac-
terized by a long prophase, lasting about 10 days.
The prophase substages of the ﬁrst meiotic divi-

sion are (Figures 20-11 and 20-12):

1. Leptotene (threadlike chromosomes).
2. Zygotene (pairing of chromosomes).
3. Pachytene (thickening of chromosomes).
4. Diplotene (chromosomes appearing double).
5. Diakinesis (chromosomes moving apart). 
These substages are characterized by four major 

events: 

1. The formation of a synaptonemal complex (see 
Box 20-C) during zygotene-pachytene to facilitate 
the pairing or synapsis of homologous chromosomes 
(autosomes and sex chromosomes X and Y). 

2. The  pairing  of  homologous  chromosomes

2. Prophase of the first meiotic division also starts in 
the fetal ovary and is arrested at diplotene. At the time 
of birth, the ovary consists of primary oocytes.
3. Completion of the first meiotic division, resulting in 
the formation of the first polar body and a secondary 
oocyte, occurs at ovulation.
4. Completion of the second meiotic division, yielding a 
haploid egg and a second polar body, takes place at 
fertilization.
5. A zygote is formed when two haploid cells, sperm 
and egg, combine their genetic material at fertilization.

and bridged.

3.  Crossing  over  is  the  exchange  of  genetic 
information  between  non-sister  chromatids  of 
homologous  chromosomes.  Crossovers  foster  ge-
netic diversity and establish physical links between 
homologues to ensure precise segregation. 

Meiotic  recombination  starts  by  DNA  double-
strand breaks (DSBs), which take place at precise 
sites as the synaptonemal complex develops. 

Crossovers along any given chromosome pair are 
evenly  spaced  over  distances  from  300  nm  to  30 
(cid:43)m. This  regularly  spaced  distribution,  known  as 
crossover interference, involves the catalytic activ-
ity of topoisomerase II (TopoII), an enzyme that 
breaks and rejoins double-stranded DNA.  Crossover 
interference means that crossover at a given chro-
mosomal  site  prevents  another  crossover  to  occur 
too close to it.

4. Disjunction (the separation of paired homolo-
gous chromosomes) after completion of crossover. 
After  this  prolonged  prophase,  pairs  of  sister 
chromatids pass through  metaphase, anaphase, and 
telophase and are separated into daughter cells, the 
secondary spermatocytes.  

During  the  second  meiotic  division,  prophase, 
metaphase, anaphase, and telophase separate sister 
chromatids into daughter cells, the spermatids.

In the female (see Figure 20-10), a primary oocyte 
(with a 4C DNA content) completes the ﬁrst meiotic 
division at ovulation to produce a  secondary oocyte 
(2C DNA content) and the ﬁrst polar body. When 
fertilization occurs, the secondary oocyte completes 
the  second  meiotic  division  to  reach  the  haploid 
state (1C DNA content), and a second polar body 
is generated.

The three most important events of meiosis are: 
1. Sperm and oocytes contain only one representa-

Box 20-C  |  Synaptonemal complex

•  The function of the synaptonemal complex is to facilitate the synapsis of 
homologous chromosomes by stabilizing their axial alignment and association. 
•  Sister chromatids are maintained in close contact by the cohesin protein 
complex. 
• The separation between synapsed homologous chromosomes is 100 nm. 
•  A synaptonemal complex consists of two lateral elements (closely associ-
ated to chromosomal chromatin loops) and a central element.
• The lateral elements are formed by the cohesin protein complex (Rec8, 
SCM1, and SCM3 proteins), SCP2, and SCP3 (SCP stands for synaptonemal 
complex protein). 
• The lateral elements are bridged by transverse ﬁbrous SCP1 dimers, whose 
terminal globular regions overlap in the center of the synaptonemal complex to 
form the central element.
• Recombination nodules are present along the synaptonemal complex during 
pachytene. They represent sites where genetic recombination between nonsis-
ter chromatids (called reciprocal exchange) will occur.

tive of each homologous pair of chromosomes. 

2.  Maternal  and  paternal  chromosomes  are  ran-

domly assorted. 

3. Crossing over increases genetic variation.

Spermatids
Haploid  spermatids  are  located  in  the  adluminal 
compartment, in proximity to the seminiferous tu-
bular lumen. There are two main types of spermatids:
1. Round or early spermatids, housed in niches in 

the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells.

2. Elongated or late spermatids, housed in crypts, 
deep invaginations in Sertoli cell apical cytoplasm.   
Spermatids are engaged in a highly differentiated 
cell process designated spermiogenesis. Spermiogen-
esis is the last step of spermatogenesis. 

Mature spermatids are released into the seminifer-
ous tubular lumen by a process called spermiation. 
Spermiation involves contractile forces generated by 
F-actin–containing hoops at the apical ectoplasmic 
region of Sertoli cells, embracing the head of a mature 
spermatid. 

Spermatids are highly polarized cells. Their polarity 
is determined by the opposite position of the Golgi-
acrosome-acroplaxome  complex  and  the  head-tail 
coupling  apparatus  (HTCA)  with  respect  to  the 
nucleus. 

Four  major  events  characterize  spermiogenesis 

(Figures 20-13 and 20-14): 

1. The development of the acrosome.
2. The development of the manchette.
3. The development of the tail.
4. The shaping and condensation of the spermatid 

nucleus.

We emphasize details of these four events because 
of their important contribution to male fertility and 
to an understanding of causes of male infertility. 

1. Development of the acrosome. The acrosome 
contains hydrolytic enzymes released at fertilization 
by a mechanism called acrosome reaction (discussed 
in detail in Chapter 23, Fertilization, Placentation, 
and Lactation).

The development of the acrosome consists of four 

sequential phases:

1. The Golgi phase.
2. The cap phase.
3. The acrosomal phase.
4. The maturation phase (see Figures 20-13 and 

20-14).

• During the Golgi phase, proacrosomal vesicles 
containing  hyaluronidase,  proacrosin,  and  other 
hydrolytic enzymes, are transported from the Golgi 
to  the  acroplaxome  along  microtubules  and  actin 
microﬁlaments using motor proteins (kinesins and 
myosin Va,  respectively). The  acroplaxome  (Greek 
akros, topmost; platys, ﬂat; sõma, body) is an actin-

envelope. 

Proacrosomal vesicles tether and dock to the acro-
plaxome and fuse to form ﬁrst the acrosome vesicle 
and then the acrosomal sac. 

• During the cap phase, Golgi-derived proacro-
somal vesicles continue to merge into the progres-
sively enlarging acrosomal sac that initiates its caudal 
descent in parallel to the elongation of the spermatid 
nucleus. 

The  acrosome  acquires  a  cap-like  shape  and  its 
narrow descending recess is anchored to the nuclear 
envelope by the desmosome-like, keratin intermedi-
ate  ﬁlament  protein–containing  marginal  ring  of 
the acroplaxome. The acroplaxome plate anchors the 
acrosome to the nuclear envelope by a spermiogene-
sis-speciﬁc LINC (for linker of nucleoskeleton and 
cytoskeleton) protein complex. LINC connects the 
dense nuclear lamina to F-actin in the acroplaxome 
(Figure 20-15).

• During the acrosomal and maturation phases, 
the shape of the acrosome-acroplaxome complex ad-
justs to the proﬁle of the elongating spermatid head. 
Mutations in the genes encoding two proacrosomal 
vesicle fusion proteins, Hrb and GOPC (for Golgi-
associated  PDZ  and  coiled-coil  motif-containing 
protein), disrupts acrosome development. A lack of 
an acrosome results in round-headed sperm (called 
globozoospermia) and male infertility.

2. Development of the manchette.  Soon after the 
development of the acrosome starts, a transient and 
predominant microtubule-containing manchette de-
velops at the caudal site of the acrosome-acroplaxome 
complex.

The manchette consists of a perinuclear ring as-
sembled just beneath the desmosome-like marginal 

Box 20-D  |  Intramanchette transport

•  The manchette is a transient microtubular structure that occupies a perinucle-
ar position during the elongation and condensation of the spermatid nucleus.
•  Microtubules are the major component of the manchette. They are formed by 
the polymerization of tubulin dimers with post-translational modiﬁcations (such 
as acetylation). F-actin microﬁlaments, aligned along microtubules, are present 
to a lesser extent. 
• Molecules involved in nucleocytoplasmatic transport (such as Ran GTPase; 
see Chapter 1, Epithelium, Figure 1-39), 26S proteasome, and microtubule- 
and F-actin–based molecular motors are present in the manchette. 
•  Molecules targeted to construct the spermatid centriolar region and derived 
developing tail are mobilized along microtubules of the manchette. Intramanch-
ette transport appears essential for cargo delivery during spermiogenesis. 
• Intramanchette transport has structural and functional similarities with the 
intraﬂagellar transport pathway, with which it interfaces during spermiogenesis.
•  Tg737 mutant mice have a defect in the gene expressing Polaris/IFT88, a 
component of the protein raft mobilized by a molecular motor along microtu-
bules.  This protein is present in the manchette of normal mice but abnormal in 
Tg737 mutants, which have defective bronchial cilia and abortive sperm tails.

ring of the acroplaxome. Microtubules are inserted 
into the perinuclear ring (see Figures 20-13 and 20-
15, and Box 20-D). Therefore, two juxtaposed rings 
embrace the caudal region of the elongating spermatid 
nucleus. The acroplaxome and manchette reduce the 
diameter of their circumvallate rings to comply with 
an equivalent reduction of the elongating nucleus.

The opposite nuclear region is encircled by F-actin 
hoops of the adjacent Sertoli cells (see Figure 20-15). 
From  a  mechanical  perspective,  the  exogenous 
clutching  forces  exerted  by  the  Sertoli  cell  F-actin 
hoops, combined with the endogenous force modu-
lation  of  the  acrosome–acroplaxome–manchette 
(AAM)  complex,  contribute  to  the  shaping  of  the 
gradually  elongating  spermatid  nucleus.  Abnormal 
assembly and function of the AAM complex cause 
a variety of sperm head shape aberrations leading to 
infertility.

 The  manchette  is  involved  in  the  trafﬁcking  of 
proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and 
in the transport of proteins involved in the develop-
ment of the HTCA and the tail. 

Intramanchette transport of various cargos engage 
motor proteins (kinesins, dyneins, and myosin Va) 
and proteins of the intraﬂagellar transport system 
(IFT proteins; see Figure 1-6 in Chapter 1, Epithe-
lium).  Disruption  of  the  intramanchette  transport 
machinery by a defective IFT protein (IFT88) results 
in abortive spermatid tail development

The manchette disassembles once the elongation 
and condensation of the spermatid nucleus is near 
completion. 

3. The  centriolar  pair  migrates  from  the  Golgi-
region to the opposite pole of the spermatid nucleus 
to initiate the development of the future sperm tail 
(see Figure 20-13). The axoneme of the sperm tail 
develops  from  the  distal  centriole. The  proximal 
centriole and pericentriolar matrix give rise to the 
HTCA, connecting the sperm head to the tail. 

The  HTCA  withstands  the  mechanical  stress  of 
the strong wave-like motion of the sperm tail during 
sperm motility.  Sperm decapitation, a cause of male 
infertility, takes place when the position and assembly 
of the HTCA are aberrant.  

Additional structural aspects of the sperm head and 

tail are discussed below (see Figure 20-15). 

4.  Nuclear  condensation.  Nuclear  condensation 
occurs when somatic histones  are replaced by argi-
nine- and lysine-rich protamines. This replacement 
stabilizes and protects sperm DNA.

After the somatic histone-to-protamine shift oc-
curs, nucleosomes disappear and smooth chromatin 
ﬁbers associate side-by-side to condense the nuclear 
material (see Figure 20-13). There is no signiﬁcant 
RNA  transcription  after  the  spermatid  maturation 
phase, when the spermatid nucleus is fully condensed.

Hydrolytic enzymes are sorted from the Golgi apparatus to the

motor proteins along microtubules and F-actin microfilaments and 
fuse with the acrosome. The centriolar pair migrates from the 
Golgi region to the opposite pole and the axoneme begins to 
assemble starting from the distal centriole. The proximal centriole 
and pericentriolar matrix  construct the head-tail coupling 
apparatus.

The acrosomal sac forms a cap attached to the nuclear envelope 
through the acroplaxome (a cytoskeletal plate), and initiates its 
descent along the elongating nucleus while attached to the 
desmosome-like marginal ring of the acroplaxome. The axoneme 
continues its growth. The spermatid rotates, the acrosome points 
to the basal lamina, and the developing axoneme extends freely 
into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule.

Completion of spermiogenesis and spermiation
During the ﬁnal spermatid maturation phase:

1. Mitochondria complete their alignment along 
the proximal segment of the developing axoneme, 
surrounded by outer dense ﬁbers. 

2. The nucleus achieves complete elongation and 

chromatin packaging.

3. The  manchette  migrates  caudally  and  disas-

sembles.  

4. The residual body, an excess of cytoplasm from 
the mature spermatid, that contains the no longer 

needed Golgi apparatus, is released and phagocytosed 
by Sertoli cells just before spermiation. 

Spermiation is the release over several days of ma-
ture spermatids from the apical edge of Sertoli cells 
into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule; see Figure 
20-13). The intercellular bridges, linking members 
of a spermatid progeny, become part of the residual 
body. As a result the conjoined mature spermatids 
become separated from each other.

Spermiation is preceded by:

    We discuss in Chapter 1, Epithelium, that microtubules participate in the 
intracellular traffic of vesicles and nonvesicle cargos.  Examples are 
axonemal transport (including ciliary transport and intraflagellar 
transport), axonal transport, and intramanchette transport. 
Intraflagellar transport was first described in the biflagellated green alga 
Chlamydomonas.
    Defective intramanchette and axonemal transport results in 
abnormal sperm tail development.

The acroplaxome is an F-actin-keratin–containing cytoskeletal 
plate with a desmosome-like marginal ring containing keratin 
intermediate filaments. The ring fastens the descending recess 
of the acrosome to the spermatid nuclear envelope. 
   During acrosome development, Golgi-derived proacrosomal 
vesicles are transported to the acroplaxome where they dock 
and fuse to form the acrosome.  A LINC complex (for linker of 
nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) anchors the spermatid 
nuclear dense lamina to F-actin in the acroplaxome. 
   Sertoli cell F-actin hoops embrace the acrosome-

ing structures, the tubulobulbar complexes, inserted 
in the neighboring Sertoli cells.

3. The release of mature spermatids from the Ser-
toli cell deep apical crypts. A cytoskeletal-dependent 
mechanism and the breakdown of cell adhesion mol-
ecules (including (cid:95)6(cid:96)1 integrins, the afadin–nectin–
F-actin complex, and junctional adhesion molecules 
C, JAM-C) assist in the disengagement of mature 
spermatids from the crypts.

Mature spermatids become nonmotile sperm upon 
release into the seminiferous tubular lumen and are 
propelled to the epididymal duct, where they undergo 
a maturation process resulting in the acquisition of 
forward motility leading to fertilization capability.

 

Structure of the sperm
The mature sperm consists of two components (Fig-
ure 20-16): the head and the tail. The HTCA links 
the head to the tail. A plasma membrane surrounds 
the head and tail regions of the sperm.

The head is composed of a ﬂattened, condensed, 
and elongated nucleus partially capped by the ac-
rosome. The acrosome covers the anterior one half 
of  the  nucleus  and  contains  hydrolytic  enzymes 
(proteases,  acid  phosphatase,  hyaluronidase,  and 

Box 20-E  |  Semen analysis

The microscopic screening of semen samples explores three main sperm 
characteristics: concentration, morphology, and motility.
   Sperm normal concentration is about 20-40 million sperm/mL of semen. Nor-
mal sperm should display a regular oval head connected to a long straight tail. 
Abnormal sperm have atypical shaped heads (round heads, pin heads, large 
heads, or double heads) and short or absent tails. Morphology is a valuable 
predictor for in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.
• The frequent cause of male infertility is a low sperm concentration (less than 
15 million sperm/mL of semen). This condition is called oligospermia (or 
oligozoospermia). A reduced volume of semen (lower than 2.0 mL-1.5 mL) is 
called hypospermia (or hypozoospermia). Semen volumes between 2.0 mL 
and 6.5 mL are normal.
• Low sperm motility is called asthenospermia (or asthenozoospermia) (Greek 
astheneia, weakness).
• Low sperm concentration and poor sperm motility often coexist. This condition 
is called oligoasthenospermia (or oligoasthenozoospermia).
• The presence in semen of sperm with abnormal morphology is called terato-
spermia (or teratozoospermia) (Greek teras, monster).
• The absence of sperm in semen is called aspermia (or azoospermia).
• The presence of dead sperm in semen is called necrospermia (or necrozoo-
spermia)
•  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria described in 
2010, sperm motility is graded as: Grade a: sperm have fast forward motility 
in a straight line. Grade b: sperm have slow forward or slow nonlinear motility 
(curved or crooked line). Grade c: sperm lack forward motility; sperm move their 
tails but do not advance forward. Grade d: sperm are immotile. Sperm classiﬁed 
Grade c and d are regarded as poor and associated with male infertility.

neuraminidase,  among  others),  usually  found  in 
lysosomes. 

The  acroplaxome  anchors  the  acrosome  to  the 

nuclear envelope.   

The tail is subdivided into three segments: 
1. The middle piece.
2. The principal piece.
3. The end piece.  
The HTCA, linking the head to the tail, consists 
of a pair of centrioles and associated proteins. The 
distal centriole gives rise to the axoneme, whereas 
the proximal centriole participates in the anchoring 
of the HTCA to the nuclear envelope. 

The middle piece of the tail consists of:
1. A helically arranged mitochondrial sheath.
2. The axoneme.
3. Nine longitudinal columns, called outer dense 
ﬁbers, surrounding the axoneme and projecting down 
the tail from the HTCA. 

The lower limit of the middle piece is marked by 
the termination of the mitochondrial helical sheath at 
the annulus, a cortical ring that contains the protein 
septin 4. 

Septin  4  is  a  member  of  the  septin  family  of 
cytoskeletal  proteins  distinct  from  microﬁlaments, 
microtubules,  and  intermediate  ﬁlaments.  Septins 
are GTPases that form cortical corset-like structures.  
Septin 4 mutant male mice are sterile due to sperm 
immotility (a condition known as asthenospermia, 
see Box 20-E). Sperm lack the cortical ring at the an-
nulus region and the kinesin-mediated intraﬂagellar 
transport of cargo proteins, required for sperm tail 
development, stalls beneath the annulus.  

The principal piece is the longest segment of the 
tail. It consists of the central axoneme surrounded 
by seven outer dense ﬁbers (instead of nine, as in 
the middle piece) and a ﬁbrous sheath.  Outer dense 
ﬁbers are not seen in cilia. 

The ﬁbrous sheath is formed by  concentric ribs 
projecting from equidistant longitudinal columns. 
Outer dense ﬁbers and the ﬁbrous sheath provide a 
rigid scaffold during microtubular sliding and bend-
ing of the tail during sperm forward motility. 

The end piece is a very short segment of the tail 
in  which  only  the  axoneme  is  present  because  of 
an  early  termination  of  the  outer  dense  ﬁbers  and 
ﬁbrous sheath.

Pathology: Conditions affecting male fertility
Temperature
A temperature of 35oC is critical for spermatogenesis. 
This temperature is achieved in the scrotum by the 
pampiniform plexus of veins surrounding the sper-
matic artery and functions as a countercurrent heat 
exchanger to dissipate heat. 

When the temperature is below 35oC, contraction

the dartos muscle in the scrotal sac brings the testes 
close to the body wall to increase the temperature.

Cryptorchidism
In cryptorchidism (or undescended testes), the testes 
fails to reach the scrotal sac during development and 
remains in the abdominal cavity or inguinal canal.

Under  these  conditions,  the  normal  body  tem-
perature  (37oC  to  38oC)  inhibits  spermatogenesis 
and sterility occurs if the condition is bilateral and 
not corrected. 

Fetal and neonatal testicular descent is controlled 
by  the  testes-produced  hormones  insulin-like  3 
(INSL3) and androgens that regulate the develop-

ment of the gubernaculum, a ligament connecting 
each testis-epididymis complex to the future scrotal 
sac. 

The gubernaculum consists of a core of mesenchy-
mal cells surrounded by striated muscle innervated by 
the genitofemoral nerve. INSL3 binds to the relaxin/
insulin-like peptide family receptor 2 (RXFP2) in the 
gubernaculum skeletal muscle cells. INSL3 appears 
to  trigger  a  neuromuscular  downstream  pathway 
leading  to  the  production  of  muscle-derived  neu-
rotrophic  proteins  required  for  the  completion  of  
testes descent.

A high incidence of testicular tumors  is associated 
with  the  untreated  cryptorchid  testes.  Cryptorchi-
dism is an asymptomatic condition that is detected 
by physical examination of the scrotal sac after birth 
and before puberty. 

Hormonal  treatment  (administration  of  human 
chorionic  gonadotropin)  may  induce  testicular 
descent. If that is unsuccessful, surgery is the next 
step, in which the testes is attached to the wall of the 
scrotal sac (a process called orchiopexy).

Inguinal hernia, cysts and hydrocele  
You may remember from Embryology that the de-
scent of the testes to the scrotal sac involves:

1. The gubernaculum, a ligament that originates 
at the testis-epidydymal complex and inserts in the 
genital swelling, the future scrotal sac.

2. An evagination of the peritoneum, the vaginal 
process, that facilitates the sliding of the descending 
testes through the inguinal canal.

Between  week  7  and  12,  the  gubernaculum 
shortens and drags the testes, the deferent duct and 
blood vessels toward the scrotal sac by a mechanism 
described above. 

During the ﬁrst year of life, the upper section of 
the vaginal process closes leaving behind the perito-
neal-vaginal ligament. The lower section becomes 
the tunica vaginalis, consisting of a parietal and a 
visceral layer.

A  congenital  inguinal  hernia  will  occur  if  the 
vaginal process is wide enough and does not close. 
If the unclosed space above the testis is narrow, 
ﬂuid, instead of an intestinal loop, can accumulate 
forming a cyst of the spermatic cord. 

If ﬂuid collects between the parietal and visceral  
layers of the tunica vaginalis, a testicular hydrocele 
is formed.

Cancer chemotherapy
Young male patients treated with antitumoral drugs 
may  become  transiently  aspermatogenic  because 
spermatogonial  mitosis  and  spermatocyte  meiosis 
can be affected. However, dormant spermatogonial 
stem cells, not involved in DNA synthesis and cell 

division, can repopulate the seminiferous epithelium 
once anticancer chemotherapy is discontinued. 

We discuss later the timing and dynamics of sper-
matogenesis, concepts that enable the physician to 
determine the recovery time frame of spermatogenesis 
upon completion of cancer chemotherapy. 

Viral orchitis
Mumps is a systemic viral infection with a 20% to 
30% incidence of unilateral or bilateral acute orchitis 
(sudden  edema  and  inﬁltration  of  lymphocytes  of 
the seminiferous intertubular space) in postpubertal 
males.  In  general,  no  alterations  in  spermatogenic 
function can be expected following mumps-caused 
orchitis. Coxsackie B virus is another pathogen for 
viral orchitis.

Spermatic cord torsion
Twisting of the spermatic cord may disrupt the arterial 
blood supply to, and venous drainage from, the testes. 
This condition, that can appear up to adolescence, is 
generally caused by physical trauma or an abnormally 
mobile testes within the tunica vaginalis. 

If torsion is not treated immediately (within the 
ﬁrst 6 hours), hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis 
of the whole testes occur.

Varicocele
This condition is caused by the abnormal dilation 
of the veins of the spermatic cord (varicosities of the 
pampiniform plexus) caused by prolonged stagnation 
of blood. A consequence of varicocele is a decrease in 
sperm production (oligospermia). Recall that veins in 
the spermatic cord play a signiﬁcant role in maintain-
ing testicular temperature at 35oC by a countercurrent 
exchange mechanism with the spermatic artery.

Leydig cells
Aggregates of Leydig cells are present in the intertubu-
lar space in proximity to blood vessels and lymphatic 
channels  or  sinusoids  (Figure  20-17).  Like  most 
steroid-producing  cells,  Leydig  cells  contain  lipid 
droplets, mitochondria with characteristic tubular 
cristae, and a well-developed smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum.

After puberty and upon stimulation with lutein-
izing  hormone (LH) by a cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate  (cAMP)–mediated  mechanism,  Leydig 
cells produce testosterone, which can be converted 
to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5(cid:95)-reductase. 
About  95%  of  the  testosterone  found  in  serum 
(bound to sex hormone–binding globulin [SHBG] 
and other proteins) is synthesized by Leydig cells; the 
remaining  testosterone  is  produced  by  the  adrenal 
cortex. 

Testosterone can also be aromatized to estrogens

Leydig cell: Androgen production

Aggregates of Leydig cells are found in the intertubular space, in close 
contact with blood vessels and lymphatic channels surrounding the 
seminiferous tubules.
  Like all steroid-producing cells, Leydig cells have abundant lipid droplets 
containing esterified cholesterol, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (with 
enzymes involved in steroidogenesis), and mitochondria with tubular cristae 
(processing cholesterol transported by StAR).
  Leydig cell function is regulated by two hormones of the anterior  
hypophysis: 

    Luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulates testosterone production.

    Prolactin, which induces the expression of LH receptor.

        Testosterone, which binds to the androgen receptor in Sertoli cells and 
maintains spermatogenesis, male libido, and the function of the male 
accessory glands (prostate and seminal vesicle). Crystals of Reinke are 
inclusions of proteins in the cytoplasm of human Leydig cells.

  

      StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) regulates the synthesis 
4
of steroids by transporting cholesterol across the outer mitochondrial 
membrane.  A mutation in the gene encoding StAR is detected in 
individuals with defective synthesis of adrenal and gonadal steroids (lipoid 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia).

produced by Sertoli cells after stimulation by FSH, 
maintains a high concentration of testosterone in the 
proximity of developing spermatogenic cells.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Steroidogenic acute 
regulatory protein (StAR) 
Fetal Leydig cells are steroidogenically active between 
8 and 18 weeks of gestation. By week 18 of gestation, 
the Leydig cell population predominates in the testes. 
The androgens produced by fetal Leydig cells at this 
time  are  critical  for  the  development  of  the  male 
reproductive tract (see the development of the testes 
in Chapter 21, Sperm Transport and Maturation). 
In  the  neonate,  testicular  steroidogenesis  reaches 
high levels at 2 to 3 months post partum and then 
decreases. Androgen levels remain low until puberty, 
when an increase in LH activates androgen synthesis. 
LH and prolactin regulate the function of Leydig 
cells (Figure 20-17; see also Figure 20-18). Prolactin 
regulates the gene expression of the LH receptor. LH 
is  responsible  for  the  production  of  testosterone. 
Hyperprolactinemia  inhibits  male  reproductive 
function by decreasing gonadotropin secretion and 
action on the testes. Excessive prolactin can decrease 
the production of androgens by Leydig cells, dimin-
ish spermatogenesis, and lead to erectile dysfunction 
and infertility.

During the synthesis of testosterone, plasma cho-
lesterol enters the cell, is esteriﬁed by acetyl coen-
zyme A (acetyl CoA) and is stored in the cytoplasm as 
lipid droplets. Fatty acids are processed to cholesterol 
in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 

Cholesterol is transported from the lipid droplet 
to mitochondria by steroidogenic acute regulatory 
protein (StAR) (synthesized in the cytosol by poly-
ribosomes), and pregnenolone is produced. 

Enzymes  in  the  smooth  endoplasmic  reticulum 
convert pregnenolone to progesterone to testoster-
one. Two other less potent androgens produced by 
Leydig  cells  are  dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA) 
and androstenedione.

In the human testes, the cytoplasm of Leydig cells 
contains crystals of Reinke, inclusions of proteins 
in a geometric array, which become more apparent 
with age.

Hormonal control of the male reproductive tract
FSH  and  LH  regulate  the  function  of  Sertoli  and 
Leydig  cells,  respectively  (see  Figure  20-18).  FSH 
stimulates the production of inhibin and activin by 
Sertoli cells. Inhibin exerts a negative feedback on 
the hypothalamic gonadotropin–releasing hormone 
(GnRH) and hypophyseal release of FSH. Activin 
has an opposite effect. 

FSH  and  LH  are  mandatory  regulators  of  the 

spermatogenic process, as demonstrated by the arrest 
of  spermatogenesis following experimental removal 
of the hypophysis (hypophysectomy).

The  synthesis  and  secretion  of  ABP  by  Sertoli 
cells are stimulated by FSH. ABP binds androgens 
(testosterone or dihydrotestosterone) and  the ABP-
androgen complex maintains high levels of androgens 
in the proximity of developing spermatogenic cells. In 
addition, the complex, released into the lumen of the 
seminiferous tubule,  is transported to the epididymis, 
where it keeps high concentration of androgens.

Sertoli cells in the adult testes produce three major 

secretory proteins: 

1. Inhibin.
2. Activin.
3. ABP. 
Fetal  Sertoli  cells  synthesize  and  secrete  anti-

müllerian hormone (AMH).

As we have already discussed, LH stimulates the 
synthesis of testosterone by Leydig cells (see Box 20-F). 
Testosterone  and  dihydrotestosterone,  the  latter  a 
metabolite of testosterone after reduction by steroid  
5(cid:95)-reductase (SRD5A), bind to the same androgen 
receptor (unrelated to ABP). 

The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the 
steroid–thyroid–retinoic acid superfamily of recep-
tors and as such it has three domains: 

1.  A  DNA  binding  domain  that  recognizes  the 

androgen-responsive element.

2. A transcription factors–binding domain
3. An androgen-binding domain.  
Recall that a defective AR, encoded by a gene in the 
X chromosome, determines the androgen insensitiv-
ity syndrome (AIS) also known as testicular feminiza-
tion. The magnitude of symptoms in individuals with 
this genetic defect is variable depending on the partial 
to complete inability of the AR to bind to androgens.
Testosterone has a negative feedback effect on the 
release of LH. An excess of testosterone in circulating 
blood prevents the release of LH from the anterior 
hypophysis. Testosterone stimulates the function of 
the seminal vesicles, whereas dihydrotestosterone acts 
on the prostate gland.

The spermatogenic cell sequence
When you examine a number of seminiferous tubules 
under the light microscope, you will see a variable 
combination of spermatogenic cells. Spermatogenic 
cells are not arranged at random but are organized 
into  well-deﬁned  combinations  called  cellular  as-
sociations (Figures 20-19 to 20-20).

 For example, in a particular region of the seminifer-
ous epithelium, spermatids, completing their differen-
tiation, can be seen only in speciﬁc combination with 
early spermatids, spermatocytes, and spermatogonia 
at their respective developmental stages.

There are two feedback loops that 
regulate spermatogenesis:
(1) Following FSH stimulation, Sertoli 
cells produce        inhibin to 
down-regulate FSH secretion. When 
the levels of FSH decrease, Sertoli 
cells secrete         activin to 
up-regulate FSH secretion.
(2)  When        testosterone levels are 
high, the secretion of  LH decreases. 
When the testosterone levels 
decrease, LH is released. GnRH in the 
hypothalamus modulates the 
FSH-inhibin-activin feedback loop and  
the LH-testosterone feedback loop.

Inhibins are dimers containing the (cid:95) subunit and one of the two (cid:96) subunits ((cid:96)A or

   Activins lack the (cid:95) subunit but are composed of two (cid:96) subunits. They can be 
homodimers ((cid:96)A(cid:96)A or (cid:96)B(cid:96)B) or heterodimers ((cid:96)A(cid:96)B).
   Inhibins and activins are synthesized in the ovaries, testes, hypophysis, and 
probably in other tissues.
    Inhibins and activins are members of the family of polypeptides that include 
transforming growth factor-(cid:96) and anti-müllerian hormone (AMH).

These cellular associations (designated by Roman 
numerals) succeed one another at a given site of the 
seminiferous tubule and this sequence repeats itself 
regularly.

You should realize that it takes several cycles, each 
consisting of precise cellular associations that repeat 
themselves (at least four times as illustrated in Figure 
20-20), to produce mature spermatids released into

How  do  these  combinations  of  spermatogenic 

cells occur? 

Let  us  examine  Figure  20-20  that  presents  a 
hypothetical example. Note that all generations of 
spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, 
and  spermatids)  coexist. The  difference  rests  on 
their step of differentiation in a given segment of a 
seminiferous  epithelium. The  development  of  any 
single  generation  takes  place  concomitantly  with 
the development of the earlier and later generations.
Each  defined  cell  association  or  combination  
represents a stage in the sequential process of sper-
matogenesis initiated by a SSC. 

  Box 20-F  |  Androgen actions: Highlights to remember

In the male fetus
•  Regulation of the differentiation of the male internal and external genitalia.
•  Stimulation of the growth, development, and function of male internal and 
external genitalia.
In the adult male
•  Stimulation of sexual hair development.
•  Stimulation of the secretion of sebaceous glands of the skin.
•  Binding to androgen receptor in Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells and 
Leydig cells and to androgen-binding protein produced by Sertoli cells after FSH 
stimulation.
•  Initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis.
•  Maintenance of the secretory function of accessory sex glands (seminal 
vesicle and prostate). 

Because several spermatogonial stem cells give rise 
to a spermatogenic cell progeny at regular intervals 
along  the  seminiferous  tubule  and  the  progenies 
overlap,  it  is  possible  to  understand  that  cellular 
associations derive from overlapping progenies at a 
given point in the seminiferous tubule.

Now, we need to discuss the difference between 
spermatogenic cycle and spermatogenic wave (see 
Figure 20-21). You realize that at a given point in the 
seminiferous  tubule,  the  cohorts  of  spermatogenic 
cells will change with time as early and late progenies 
continue their development. It is just a question of 
time (hours and days) for the stages of the cycle (rep-
resented by cellular associations) to change.  

A spermatogenic cycle is deﬁned by the time it 
takes for a sequence of cellular associations (or stages 
of the cycle) at a particular point of the seminiferous 
tubule to change.

 We now want to determine the alignment of cell 
associations along the length of the seminiferous tu-
bule.  You realize that we have changed our parameter 
from time to distance. 

We  isolate  a  seminiferous  tubule,  prepare  serial 
histologic sections along its length, and use already 
available tables to verify whether cellular associations 
are present. 

After examining a number of serial sections cover-
ing a distance of a few millimeters or centimeters, 
we realize the presence of successive cellular associa-

       Distinct spermatogenic cells in the 
seminiferous epithelium are only found in 
association with other specific spermatogenic 
cells. This constant cell combination is known as 
cell association and is designated by a Roman 
numeral. 

2
       Because the development of each spermatogenic cell progeny 
(starting from a spermatogonial stem cell, SSC) is in synchrony with 
preceding and later progenies, a series of different cell associations 
can be seen along the seminiferous tubule. 
    A series of consecutive cell associations constitute the stages of a 
cycle. 
    The number of cycles is species-dependent. Note that in the 
diagram of a hypothetical example, cycle 1 consists of sucessive 
cell associations labeled I to VI. Then cycle 2 appears starting with 
stage I. Cycle 3 and cycle 4 are repeats of cycle 1 and cycle 2. In 
this example, a total of four cycles must be completed before 
sperm derived from the initial SSC can be released into the 
seminiferous tubular lumen.
    In the human, each cycle lasts 16 days, and the progeny initiated 
from a spermatogonial stem cell must pass through 4 cycles (or 64 
days) before release of mature spermatids from the seminiferous 
epithelium (spermiation).

A spermatogenic cycle involves cellular association 
changes with time at one particular point of the 
seminiferous tubule. These changes occur as overlapping 
spermatogenic cell progenies advance in their development. 
    Imagine that you can monitor changes in the cellular 
associations or stages of a cycle using a time-lapse camera 
placed at that given point of the seminiferous tubule.

A spermatogenic wave involves changes along a 
seminiferous tubule (distance). 
    Imagine that you can visualize a wave by “traveling” along 
the length of a seminiferous tubule.
    A wave is not distinct in the human testis because of the 
helical progression of spermatogenic cell progenies. 

tions (or stages of a cycle) along the length of the 
seminiferous tubule. 

We realize that all 6 cellular associations or stages 
(equivalent to one cycle) occur in a wavelike suc-
cession along a stretch of a seminiferous tubule (as 
illustrated in Figure 20-20). 

The series of cycles, each formed by 6 consecutive 
stages, repeat themselves again and again. We measure 
the  distance  between  two  consecutive  cycles  (each 
represented by 6 consecutive cellular associations or 
stages of a cycle) and deﬁne what a spermatogenic 
wave is.

The number of cellular associations or stages in a 
cycle is constant for any given species (14 stages in 
the rat, 6 stages in man, 12 in the monkey).  Things 
are not that simple in human testis. 

In human testes, spermatogenic cell generations are 
organized in a helical fashion instead of a longitudinal 
and consecutive sequence as in rodents (see Figure 20-
19). Consequently, a cross section of a seminiferous 
tubule will display three or four cellular associations 
instead of the single one observed in the rat testes. In 
man, the duration of one cycle is 16 days. It takes 
four cycles (64 days) to develop spermatogonia into 
testicular sperm.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Epigenetics reprogramming
We  have  seen  that  somatic  histones  are  removed 
from spermatids and replaced by arginine-, lysine-
rich protamines. 

This histone-protamine shift results in:

1. RNA transcriptional  inactivation (called gene 

silencing) .

2.  Changes  in  chromatin  structure  from  a 
nucleosomal-type to a smooth-type of chromatin in 
late spermatids (see Figure 20-13). This structural 
modiﬁcation enables the condensation of chromatin 
and protects DNA from degradation. 

Changes in DNA and histones can modify gene 
activity  without  changing  DNA  sequence.  Such 
modiﬁcations are called epigenetic (getting around 
conventional  genetics):  epigenetic  modiﬁcations 
affect  gene  expression  without  modifying  DNA 
sequence. As we will see, DNA methylation, consist-
ing in methyl groups added to DNA, can initiate a 
cascade of events silencing RNA transcription. 
There are important concepts to remember:
1.  During  gametogenesis  (spermatogenesis  and 
oogenesis), genetic imprints are differentially erased 
to allow epigenetic reprogramming to be transmitted 
to embryos by the gametes. 

DNA of mature spermatids is highly methylated 
(Figure 20-22), in comparison with a more modest 
methylation pattern during oogenesis.

2.  Immediately  after  fertilization,  there  is  sig-
niﬁcant sperm DNA demethylation, followed by an 
extensive loss of DNA methylation from most of the 
genomic DNA in human embryos. 

3. After implantation, DNA methylation increases 
rapidly when embryonic cells acquire the character-
istics of cell and tissue differentiation.

In  summary,  reprogramming  during  gameto-

Figure 20-22. Epigenetics reprogramming

Gametogenesis (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) in mammals is under 
the control of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics consists 
in the reprogramming of specific gene expression by two major 
mechanisms: DNA methylation and histone modifications (acetylation, 
phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation). 
    The major objectives are to erase and reprogram methylation patterns 
to reset imprints and/or eliminate acquired epigenetic modifications. 

A disruption of DNA methylation and histone modifications of 
alleles lead to abnormal developmental processes, including 
Prader-Willi syndrome (characterized by hypotony, respiratory 
distress, obesity, short stature, and mild mental retardation) and 
Angelman’s syndrome (severe mental retardation, excessive 
laughter, lack of speech, and hyperactivity). Both syndromes have 
an epigenetic defect caused by a lack of methylation of several 
paternally derived alleles.

genesis is required for the resetting of imprints or 
eliminating acquired epigenetic modiﬁcations. The 
pluripotent inner cell mass of the blastocyst erases 
the epigenetic memory before implantation. The epi-
genetic memory is back so embryo cells can achieve 
tissue-speciﬁc patterns.

There is a close relationship between gene imprint-
ing,  chromatin  structure,  and  DNA  methylation. 
During  gametogenesis,  the  differential  expression 
of alleles (Greek allos, another) can be inhibited in 
paternal  and  maternal  gametes.  As  you  remember 
from previous discussions, genes come in pairs, one 
copy  or  allele  inherited  from  each  parent.  During 
spermatogenesis  and  oogenesis  one  copy  of  the 
imprinted  gene  is  selectively  silenced.    Imprinting 
disorders are seen when the alternative maternal or 
paternal copy (allele) does not appear. 

Defects in parental imprinting include (see Figure 

20-22):

1. Prader-Willi syndrome.
2. Angelman’s syndrome. 
Prader-Willi  syndrome  is  characterized  by  hy-
potony,  respiratory  distress,  obesity,  short  stature, 
and  mild  mental  retardation.    It  is  caused  by  the 
deletion of a paternal allele or the retention of two 
maternal copies. 

retardation,  excessive  inappropriate  laughter,  lack 
of speech, and hyperactivity. In contrast to Prader-
Willi  syndrome,  the  maternal  allele  has  been  lost 
or  two  paternal  copies  are  retained.  Although  two 
alleles are available (one inherited from each parent), 
the affected individuals have mutations in the DNA 
regions controlling gene imprinting of the two alleles. 
 We now address with this background the mo-
lecular aspects of epigenetics reprogramming (Figure 
20-23). 

Epigenetics  is  focused  on  the  following  basic 

premises:

1. Differences in gene expression patterns are not 
determined by heritable changes in DNA sequence.
2. DNA methylation occurs on cytosine bases in 
the dinucleotide sequence cytosine-guanine: CpG, 
where p denotes the DNA phosphate backbone.

Because C pairs with G on complementary DNA 
strands, islands of CpG dinucleotides align in both 
strands  and  are  methylated  in  the  same  site. This 
means  that  methylation  patterns  can  be  passed  to 
daughter cells when cells divide so they can maintain 
their epigenetic identity. A large number of CpG is-
lands are present in transcription initiation sites and 
in promoters of active genes.

2. Histone modiﬁcations take place, in particular 

Angelman  syndrome  includes    severe  mental 

histone deacetylation.

        Transcriptionally active chromatin consists of 
transcription factors and RNA polymerase bound to 
the gene promoter region. Histones in the nucleoso-
mal core are acetylated.

        Transcriptional silencing starts when DNA 
methyltransferases methylate CpG islands on DNA.  
Methylated DNA binding proteins (MBD), including 
histone deacetylase, are recruited to the methylated 
CpG islands. Histone deacetylase relocates to the 
histone core and removes acetyl groups from histones.

        Histone deacetylation enables histone

methyltransferase to attach methyl groups to 
histones and heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is 
recruited to histone methylated sites. 
   Chromatin is condensed and transcription stops.

patients with the rare disease called ICF

Histone methyltransferase

Chromatin of an actively transcribing gene (eu-
chromatin)  has  acetylated  histones  and  the  CpG 
islands  are  unmethylated.  This  “open”  chromatin 
organization enables transcription factors and RNA 
polymerase to transcribe a gene. Chromatin can be 
condensed (heterochromatin) to become transcrip-
tionally inactive. 

Two events take place to accomplish this task: 
1. DNA methyltransferases methylate CpG islands.
2. Histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups from 
the N-terminal tail of the nucleosomal histones.     
Methylation consists of the attachment of a methyl 
group to a biological molecule by methyltransferases. 
DNA  methyltransferases  (Dnmt1,  Dnmt3a,  and 
Dnmt3b,  with  the  participation  of  Dnmt3L)  at-
tach methyl groups to CpG dinucleotides. Histone 
methyltransferases attach methyl groups to histones 
after  they  have  become  deacetylated  by  histone 
deacetylases. 

How do histone deacetylases know when to remove 
acetyl  groups  from  histones?  Methylated  DNA-
binding  protein  (MBD)  and    histone  deacetylase 
(which removes acetyl groups) are recruited to the 
CpG island when they become methylated. Histone 
deacetylation  is  a  prerequisite  for  histone  meth-
ylation,  which  involves  histone  methyltransferase 
targeting  histone  3  (H3).  H3  methylation  results 
in the recruitment of the effector heterochromatin 
protein-1  (HP1).  Chromatin  condenses  and  tran-
scription is inactivated (“closed” chromatin).

The  clinical  signiﬁcance  of  DNA  and  histone 
methylation,  coupled  with  histone  deacetylation, 
points to the therapeutic reactivation of abnormally 
silenced tumor-suppressor genes. DNA methylation 
inhibitors  and  histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  are 
promising agents in cancer treatment.

Pathology: Testicular tumors
Testicular tumors are detected in 30- to 40-year old 
individuals. Two  signiﬁcant  risk  factors  are  crypt-
orchidism  and  gonadal  dysgenesis  (for  example, 
Klinefelter’s syndrome or the testicular feminization 
syndrome). An increase in X-chromosome number 
is a common feature of testicular germ cell tumors.
Serum  tumor  markers  are  (cid:95)-fetoprotein  (AFP), 
the  (cid:96)  subunit  of  human  chorionic  gonadotropin 
((cid:96)-hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1.

Testicular  tumors  are  classiﬁed  into  three  major 

groups (Figure 20-24):

1. Seminomas.
2. Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs).
3. Sex cord cell tumors.
Seminoma occurs in younger  patients and is the 
most common testicular tumor. Seminomas are well 
delimited lobulated yellowish tumoral masses con-
ﬁned to the testis. It consists of nodules surrounded 
by connective tissue cells. Tumor cells are large and 
uniform with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. 
Sincytiotrophoblasts  may  be  present  in  testicular 
seminomas. Serum levels of (cid:96)-hCG are moderately

elevated. Spermatocytic seminoma is regarded as a 
variant of seminoma. It is seen in older patients. His-
tologically, it mimics meiotic cells (spermatocytes).
TGCTs  include    testicular  intraepithelial  neo-
plasia  (TIN),  embryonal  carcinoma,  teratoma, 
choriocarcinoma and yolk sac tumor.

TIN (also called intratubular germ cell neoplasia) 
is the initial phase of invasive TGCTs that develops 
in 70% of the cases after an average of 7 years. Ma-
lignant cells resembling seminoma cells are conﬁned 

within seminiferous tubules. Tumor cells stain posi-
tive for membrane-associated placental-like alkaline 
phosphatase  (PLAP)  and  c-kit  receptor.  As  you 
remember, c-kit receptor is expressed in primordial 
germ cells and differentiating spermatogonia.

TGCTs, as indicated above, correlate with all kinds 
of X chromosome gains. In fact, the gene TGCT1 lo-
cated to the long arm (Xq27) appears associated with 
a risk of bilateral TGCTs, presumably mediated by 
the increased expression of two X chromosome-linked

oncogenes  (ARAF1,  encoding  a  serine/threonine 
kinase, and ELK1, a transcription factor).

Male infertility is associated with TIN, a clinical 
observation  to  be  taken  into  account  during  the 
differential  diagnostic  process  in  all  young  men. 
Radical orchiectomy is generally performed through 
an inguinal incision. Organ-preserving surgery is an 
alternative to orchiectomy in patients who want to 
father children and the TIN has a reduced size.  

In a few patients, germ cell tumors may have an 
extragonadal  localization  (in  the  retroperitoneum 
or  mediastinum)  in  addition  to TIN.  Remember 
that primordial germinal cells that do not reach the 
gonadal ridges during gonadogenesis and are not de-
stroyed by apoptosis can give rise to germ cell tumors. 
Elevated AFP or (cid:96)-hCG correlate with a extragonadal 
germ cell tumor that is generally conﬁrmed by biopsy. 
Embryonal carcinoma consists of epithelial cells 
arranged in cords. The tumor cells show large nuclei 
with  an  irregular  outline  and  noticeable  nucleoli. 
Tumor cells are PLAP- and cytokeratin-positive.

Teratoma is a benign germ cell tumor derived from 
a combination of the tissues from all three embryonic 
layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Terato-
mas are seen in prepubertal and postpubertal patients. 
The  tumor  consists  of  cysts  (containing    mucoid 

material and nodules of cartilage), solid tissue (im-
mature form) and malignant transformed teratomas.
Choriocarcinoma  is  a  malignant  tumor  with 
trophoblastic  cells  found  in  teenagers.  In  contrast 
to germ cell tumors, it presents metastasis before a 
testicular mass is found. Serum levels of (cid:96)-HCG are 
signiﬁcantly elevated and gynecomastia is frequent. 
Yolk  sac  tumor  is  the  most  common  testicular 
tumor of childhood. The tumor consists of blood ves-
sels surrounded by squamous tumor cells organizing 
glomerular-like structures known as Schiller-Duval 
bodies.

Sex cord cell tumors include Leydig cell tumor 

and Sertoli cell tumor. 

Leydig  cell  tumor,  the  most  frequent  sex  cord 
cell tumor, is seen at any age. Tumor cells display a 
vacuolated cytoplasm, representing the presence of 
abundant  lipid  droplets,  and  occasional  crystals  of 
Reinke (a typical feature of human Leydig cells as we 
have seen). Tumor cells stain positively for inhibin. 
Sertoli cell tumor are generally benign and small. 
Tumor cells are vimentin- and cytokeratin-positive. 
Typical seminoma may mimic a Sertoli cell tumor 
because of the microlobular organization and presence 
of cells with clear nuclei and conspicuous nucleolus 
like Sertoli cells.

Essential concepts

Spermatogenesis

• Components of the male reproductive sys-
tem.  It consists of:
  (1) The testes (the site of production of 
sperm and androgens).
  (2) The epididymis (the site of sperm 
maturation).
  (3) The excurrent duct system (vas deferens, 
ejaculatory ducts, and urethra).
  (4) The accessory glands (seminal vesicles, 
prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands of 
Cowper).
  (5) The penis (the copulatory organ).

• The testes are located in the scrotal sac. Each 
testes is surrounded by the tunica albuginea 
(dense connective tissue) concentrated in the 
mediastinum, where the rete testis is located. 
The network of blood vessels under the tunica 
albuginea is called tunica vasculosa. Septa or 
partitions derived from the mediastinum divide 
the testes into 250 to 300 lobules.  Each lob-
ule contains 1 to 4 seminiferous tubules. 

• The seminiferous tubule consists of:
  (1) The seminiferous tubular wall.
  (2) The seminiferous epithelium surrounding 
a central lumen. 
  The wall consists of collagen-producing ﬁbro-
blasts and contractile myoid cells. A basement 
membrane, consisting of a basal lamina and 
reticular lamina,  separates the wall from the 
seminiferous epithelium.

  The two ends of the tubule open into the 
rete testis, a network of channels collecting 
testicular sperm, secretory proteins, and ﬂuid 
produced by the seminiferous epithelium. 
  The space between seminiferous tubules is 
called the intertubular space. It contains blood 
vessels, lymphatic channels, and clusters of 
the androgen-producing Leydig cells.

• The seminiferous epithelium consists of:
  (1) Somatic Sertoli cells.
  (2) Spermatogenic cells. 
  The stratiﬁed cellular arrangement of sper-
matogenic cells (spermatogonia, primary and 
secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids) 
enables the classiﬁcation of the seminiferous 
epithelium as stratiﬁed with structural and 
functional characteristics not found in other 
stratiﬁed epithelia. 
  For example,  a postmitotic cell population of 
somatic Sertoli cells interacts with mitotically 
dividing spermatogonia, meiotically dividing 
spermatocytes, and differentiating haploid 
spermatids. The only permanent member of 
the epithelium is the Sertoli cell.

• The mammalian spermatogenic sequence 
starts at puberty from a spermatogonial stem 
cell (SSC) derived from the primordial germ 
cells (PGCs) colonizing the gonadal ridges. 
  SSC divide by mitosis to produce two 
daughter cells. One daughter cell initiates a 
spermatogenic cycle. The other daughter cell, 

a reserve SCC, retains self-renewal capacity 
and initiate a separate spermatogenic series 
at a later time. Reserve SCC are resistant to 
radiation and cancer chemotherapy. This is an 
important consideration regarding the fertility 
of young patients undergoing one or both 
treatments.
  There are two signiﬁcant characteristics to 
remember: 
  (1) All spermatogenic cells remain connect-
ed by cytoplasmic bridges after cell division. 
  (2) Spermatogenic cell cohorts proliferate 
and differentiate synchronously. 

• Sertoli cells. It is the predominant mitotically 
dividing cell type in the postnatal testes. After 
puberty, Sertoli cells become postmitotic. 
  Sertoli cells are columnar cells extending 
from the tubular wall to the lumen. They are 
linked to each other by basally located tight 
junctions. Tight junctions, the basis for the 
blood-testes barrier, divide the seminifer-
ous epithelium into a basal compartment 
(housing spermatogonia) and an adluminal 
compartment (where spermatocytes and 
spermatids are located). 
  The nucleus of the Sertoli cells is usually 
found close to the seminiferous wall. It has 
an irregular outline with euchromatin and 
a large nucleolus ﬂanked by two masses of 
heterochromatin.
  After puberty, Sertoli cell function is regu-
lated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

  Sertoli cells secrete the (cid:95)(cid:96) heterodimer 
inhibin, which exerts a negative feedback on 
the mechanism of release of FSH, and the (cid:95)(cid:95) 
or (cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:3)homodimer activin, which has positive 
feedback action on FSH release.  
  FSH stimulates the production of androgen-
binding protein (ABP), a Sertoli cell secretory 
protein.
  In the fetal testes, Sertoli cells secrete anti-
müllerian hormone (AMH), a glycoprotein that 
prevents the development of the müllerian 
duct. Sertoli cells take up by phagocytosis 
residual bodies left behind by mature sperma-
tids upon their release from Sertoli cell crypts 
at spermiation.  

• Spermatogonia. Spermatogonial cells 
are diploid cells. They derive from the SCC 
progenitor and divide by mitosis several times 
while retaining cytoplasmic bridges. They are 
in direct contact with the tubular wall. 
  There are two major types: 
  (1) Type A spermatogonia, with an oval eu-
chromatic nucleus and eccentric nucleolus.
  (2) Type B spermatogonia, with round nuclei 
displaying clumps of chromatin near the 
nuclear envelope and a central nucleolus. 
  In the human testes, type A spermatogonia 
can be subdivided into type A pale and type A 
dark based on the nuclear characteristics.

• Spermatocytes. There are:
  (1) Primary spermatocytes, derived from 
type B spermatogonia committed to meiosis 

(instead of mitosis) after duplicating their 
DNA content.
  (2) Secondary spermatocytes, derived from 
the ﬁrst meiotic division of primary spermato-
cytes. 
  Meiosis has two major objectives: 
  (1) The exchange of genetic informa-
tion between nonsister chromatids (called 
reciprocal exchange) of paired homologous 
chromosomes.
  (2) To achieve a haploid status at the end of 
meiosis II. 
  It is important to remember that oogenesis 
in the female starts in the fetal ovary, in con-
trast to the male, which starts spermatogen-
esis after puberty. 
  In the fetal ovary, oogonia, the spermatogo-
nia-equivalent in the male, divide by mitosis 
a number of times, enter meiosis I as primary 
oocytes and do not advance beyond the 
last phase of meiotic prophase I until after 
puberty. Primary oocytes, but not oogonia, are 
present in the ovary at the time of birth. 
  It is also relevant that the completion of 
meiosis I of a primary oocyte (which occurs 
at ovulation) yields a secondary oocyte and a 
cell rudiment called a ﬁrst polar body. 
  If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, meiosis 
II is completed and a second polar body is 
produced. The objective here is to have the 
secondary oocyte pronucleus reach a haploid 
state at the time when the haploid male 
pronucleus penetrates the egg.

• Meiosis consists of two steps: 

  (1) Meiosis I, reductional division, when 
homologous chromosomes, each consisting 
of two sister chromatids, separate.
  (2) Meiosis II, equational division, when 
sister chromatids separate. 
  Meiosis I is prolonged (days) because it has 
a long prophase; meiosis II is shorter (min-
utes) and is not preceded by DNA synthesis. 
   Meiotic prophase I consists of well-deﬁned 
substages: 
  (1) Leptotene, in which each chromosome 
consists of two sister chromatids.
  (2) Zygotene, when homologous chromo-
somes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) 
start to pair (a process called synapsis) at the 
time when the synaptonemal complex starts 
to assemble.
  (3) Pachytene, the longest substage of 
meiotic prophase I in which a synaptonemal 
complex is fully assembled and crossing over 
between nonsister chromatids of the paired 
chromosomes begins.
  (4) Diplotene, a substage when disjunction 
(separation) of paired chromosomes occurs.
  (5) Diakinesis, represented by chiasmata 
(crossing points) and the disassembly of the 
synaptonemal complex.
   The synaptonemal complex is a protein-
containing ribbon. It consists of two lateral 
elements and a central element. Each lateral 
element, representing the remnant of the 
axial chromosomal core of each paired chro-
mosome, contains a cohesin protein complex 
and proteins SCP3 and SCP2 (SCP stands for 
synaptonemal complex protein).

20. SPERMATOGENESIS

Essential concepts

• Spermatids.  There are two major morpho-
logic types of spermatid: 
  (1) Round or early spermatids.
  (2) Elongated or late spermatids. 
  Spermatids are haploid cells derived from 
the division of secondary spermatocytes. They 
are involved in a process called spermio-
genesis, the last phase of spermatogenesis, 
consisting of the development of the acro-
some and the tail, and the elongation and 
condensation of the nucleus. 
  Spermiogenesis consists of four phases:
  (1) Golgi phase: Golgi-derived proacrosomal 
vesicles are transported by motor proteins 
(kinesins and myosin Va) along microtubules 
and F-actin to the acroplaxome, where they 
tether, dock, and fuse to form the acrosomal 
vesicle. The Golgi-associated centrosome initi-
ates its migration to the opposite nuclear pole 
to develop the spermatid tail.  
  (2) Cap phase:  Gradual fusion of Golgi-
derived proacrosomal vesicles change the 
acrosomal vesicle into the acrosomal sac. The 
acrsosomal sac forms a cap to the elongating 
spermatid nucleus and initiates, together with 
the acroplaxome, its caudal descent. 
  A desmosome-like structure, the marginal 
ring of the acroplaxome, fastens the descend-
ing acrosomal sac recess to the spermatid 
nuclear envelope. The manchette initiates its 
development just below the marginal ring of 
the acroplaxome by assembling a perinuclear 
ring, the insertion site of manchette microtu-
bules. 
  (3) Acrosomal phase. Spermatid nuclear 
condensation and elongation take place 
as somatic-type of nucleosome-containing 
chromatin is replaced by smooth chromatin 
ﬁbers as somatic histones are replaced by 
protamine. RNA transcription becomes gradu-
ally silent.
  (4) Maturation phase. The manchette 
disassembles as mitochondria migrate and 
surround the proximal segment of the devel-
oping spermatid tail. 
  These four phases describe the morpho-
genesis of the acrosome and the spermatid 
nucleus. Yet, there are signiﬁcant changes 
in gene expression during spermiogenesis. 
Defective gene expression result in abnormal 
sperm development, a condition known as 
teratozoospermia, that affects male fertility.
  Spermiogenesis includes the development 
of the tail, a structure that contains the axo-
neme surrounded by outer dense ﬁbers and a 
ﬁbrous sheath.
  The acrosome is a sac consisting of an outer 
acrosomal membrane and an inner acrosomal 
membrane and contains hydrolytic enzymes 
to be released following the acrosome reac-
tion during fertilization. 
  The inner acrosomal membrane is attached 
to the spermatid nuclear envelope and sub-
jacent nuclear lamina by a cytoskeletal plate 
called the acroplaxome. The acroplaxome 
consists of F-actin, actin-polymerizing proteins, 
and keratin 5.
  The manchette is a transient microtubular 
structure positioned caudally with respect 

to the acrosome-acroplaxome complex. The 
manchette participates in:
  (1) Nucleocytoplasmic transport, an impor-
tant event during the somatic histone-prot-
amine shift during nuclear condensation.
  (2) Intramanchette transport of cargos 
required for tail development.
  (3) Together with the acrosome-acroplaxome 
complex, the manchette has a role in sper-
matid head shaping. Round-shaped sperm, 
unable to fertilize, develop when there are de-
ﬁciencies in the structure and function of the 
acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex.

the testis-epididymis complex to the scrotal 
sac. INSL3 binds to the relaxin/insulin-like 
peptide family receptor 2 (RXFP2) in the 
gubernaculum skeletal muscle.  Mutations in 
the INSL3 gene have been associated with 
bilateral cryptorchidism.
  Viral orchitis. Mumps is a systemic viral 
infection with a 20% to 30% incidence of 
unilateral or bilateral acute orchitis (sudden 
edema and inﬁltration of lymphocytes of the 
seminiferous intertubular space) in postpu-
bertal males. Coxsackie B virus is another 
pathogen for viral orchitis.

•  Sperm. Nonmotile mature spermatids are 
released into the seminiferous tubular lumen 
and transported to the rete testis. Transport 
depends on ﬂuid ﬂowing along the lumen of 
the seminiferous tubules and the contractile 
activity of myoid cells present in the seminifer-
ous peritubular wall. 
  The sperm consists of a head and a tail con-
nected to each other at the neck region by the 
head-tail coupling apparatus derived from the 
centrosome. The head contains the acrosome 
and the condensed nucleus. The acroplaxome, 
a cytoskeletal plate, links the acrosome to the 
nuclear envelope.
  The tail consists of three segments: 
  (1) The middle piece contains the axoneme, 
outer dense ﬁbers, and a mitochondrial 
sheath. Mitochondria provide adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) as a source of energy for 
the sliding of axonemal microtubules during 
tail beating. 
  (2) The principal piece consists of the axo-
neme, outer dense ﬁbers, a pair of concentric 
ribs, and the ﬁbrous sheath. 
  (3) The end piece is a short segment con-
taining the terminal portion of the axoneme. 
An annulus, containing the protein septin 4, rep-
resents the limiting ring between the middle 
piece and the principal piece.

• Conditions affecting male fertility
A temperature of 35oC is essential for sper-
matogenesis. This temperature is achieved in 
the scrotum by the pampiniform plexus and 
spermatid artery participating in countercurrent 
heat exchange. 
  Varicocele (dilation of the veins of the 
pampiniform plexus) hampers heat exchange 
and may lead to a decrease in sperm produc-
tion.
  Spermatic cord torsion is caused by the 
twisting of the spermatic cord that disrupts the 
arterial blood supply to, and venous drain-
age from, the testes. This condition, that can 
appear up to adolescence, is generally caused 
by physical trauma or an abnormally mobile 
testes within the tunica vaginalis. 

  Cryptorchidism (or undescended testes) 
is the failure of one or both testes to reach 
the scrotal sac. Fetal and neonatal testicular 
descent is controlled by the testis-produced 
hormones insulin-like 3 (INSL3) and andro-
gens that regulate the development of the 
gubernaculum, a ligament attached cpnnecting 

• Leydig cells. Clusters of Leydig cells are 
observed in the intertubular space associated 
with blood vessels and lymphatic channels. 
Leydig cells produce testosterone when 
stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and 
prolactin. As in all steroid-producing cells 
(for example, in the adrenal cortex and the 
corpus luteum of the ovary), cholesterol is 
esteriﬁed by acetyl coenzyme A and stored 
as cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Cholesterol is 
transported to mitochondria by steroidogenic 
acute regulatory protein (StAR) to produce 
pregnenolone. Enzymes of the smooth endo-
plasmic reticulum convert pregnenolone to 
progesterone to testosterone.

•  Hormonal regulation of spermatogene-
sis. Sertoli cell activities are dependent on the 
FSH-activin-inhibin complex. The production 
of testosterone by Leydig cells is under control 
of LH. Therefore, FSH and LH are mandatory 
regulators of spermatogenesis as demon-
strated by the collapse of spermatogenesis 
following hypophysectomy (surgical removal 
of the hypophysis). Testosterone binds to ABP, 
produced by Sertoli cells following FSH stimu-
lation. The ABP-testosterone complex is trans-
ported to the epididymis together with mature 
spermatids. Recall the importance of cytosol 
and nuclear androgen receptor in mediating 
androgen effects. As we have seen, the gene 
encoding androgen receptor is located in the 
X chromosome and patients with androgen 
insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminization) 
have a defective androgen receptor gene.

• The spermatogenic developmental se-
quence. A few concepts need to be reviewed.
  (1) A SSC gives rise by mitosis to a daughter 
cell that initiates a spermatogenic cell progeny, 
and another daughter cell that becomes a 
reserve SSC. The reserve SSC will divide again 
and continue the same self-renewal cycle of 
its progenitor. This event starts at puberty.
  (2) At a given developmental time, several 
progenies will coexist: early and late prog-
enies. A section of a seminiferous tubule 
represents the coexistence of two or more 
spermatogenic cell progenies started by dif-
ferent SSCs.
  (3)The progression of spermatogenesis is 
a precise timely process coordinated by the 
existence of cytoplasmic bridges within a 
spermatogonial, spermatocyte, and spermatid 
cohort. As a result, it is possible to determine

with great precision a series of cellular com-
binations in sections of seminiferous tubules 
(except in man). Each cellular combination is 
called a cellular association.
  (4) It was noted that the cellular association 
sequence repeats a number of times. Each 
repeat of cellular associations is known as a 
cycle. Therefore, a cycle consists of cellular 
associations, each representing a stage of the 
cycle. 
  (5) If you can trace a progeny starting from 
a radiolabeled spermatogonial stem cell, 
you will realize that no radiolabeled mature 
spermatids are ready for release at the end of 
the ﬁrst cycle. It takes three additional cycles to 
accomplish this goal. 
  By following day-by-day the radiolabeled 
progeny, it is possible to determine the dura-
tion of a cycle.
  If the completion of one cycle occurs within 
16 days and four cycles are needed for mature 
spermatids to be ready for release, we can 
say that it takes 64 days to produce mature 
spermatids from a starting spermatogonial 
stem cell.  
  (6) You should be able to distinguish the 
difference between a spermatogenic cycle and 
a spermatogenic wave. 
  A spermatogenic cycle is deﬁned by 
changes in cellular associations that occur with 
time.     
  A spermatogenic wave is deﬁned by the 
sequence of cellular associations that occurs 
along the length of a seminiferous tubule. 
  (7) Although the concept of a spermatogenic 
cycle applies to human spermatogenesis, the 
concept of a spermatogenic wave is not as 
precise as in rodents. It will take 16 days for 
each of the four cycles (each consisting of 6 
cellular associations) to result in the release, 
after 64 days, of mature spermatids from the 
human seminiferous epithelium. 
  There is, however, a complication concerning 
the spermatogenic wave: the progression of 
the spermatogenic cell progenies, started by a 
spermatogonial stem cell, is helicoidal (instead 
of linear as in rodents). The turns of at least 
three helices, each with a different cellular as-
sociation, can be visualized in a cross section 
of a human seminiferous tubule.

•  Epigenetics.  During spermatogenesis and 
oogenesis, genetic imprints are erased to allow 
epigenetic reprogramming to be transmitted to 
embryos by the gametes. 
  Reprogramming determines the differential 
expression of a number of alleles in the pa-
ternal and maternal gametes. One copy of an 
imprinted gene is silenced during gametogen-
esis. A defect in parental imprinting can give 
rise to Prader-Willi syndrome and Angel-
man’s syndrome. 
  Important concepts to remember:
  (1) During gametogenesis (spermatogenesis 
and oogenesis), genetic imprints are differen-
tially erased to allow epigenetic reprogram-
ming to be transmitted to embryos by the 
gametes.
  (2) Immediately after fertilization, there is 
signiﬁcant sperm DNA demethylation, followed 

by an extensive loss of DNA methylation from 
most of the genomic DNA in human embryos. 
  (3) After implantation, DNA methylation 
increases rapidly when embryonic cells acquire 
the characteristics of cell and tissue differentia-
tion.

  Epigenetics is the study of differences in 
gene expression patterns that are not deter-
mined by heritable changes in DNA sequence. 
  The basis of epigenetics is the methylation 
of cytosine-phospho-guanosine (CpG) islands 
seen predominantly in actively transcribing 
genes. 
  When DNA methylation occurs, with the 
participation of DNA methyl- transferases, 
transcription factors and RNA polymerase fail 
to transcribe a gene “silenced” by methylation. 
Methylated CpG islands recruit  methylated 
DNA-binding proteins. One of them is histone 
deacetylase.
  For transcription to occur, the N-terminal 
tail of histones must be acetylated. Histone 
deacetylation enables histone methyltrans-
ferases to methylate histone 3 and recruit 
heterochromatin protein-1 to trigger chromatin 
condensation. As you already know, hetero-
chromatin (condensed chromatin) is transcrip-
tionally inactive. 
  There are important concepts to remember:
  (1) During gametogenesis (spermatogenesis 
and oogenesis), genetic imprints are differen-
tially erased to allow epigenetic reprogram-
ming to be transmitted to embryos by the 
gametes. DNA of mature spermatids is highly 
methylated (Figure 20-22), in comparison with 
a more modest methylation pattern during 
oogenesis.
  (2) Immediately after fertilization, there is 
signiﬁcant sperm DNA demethylation, followed 
by an extensive loss of DNA methylation from 
most of the genomic DNA in human embryos. 
  (3) After implantation, DNA methylation 
increases rapidly when embryonic cells acquire 
the characteristics of cell and tissue differentia-
tion.
  Remember that reprogramming during 
gametogenesis is required for the resetting 
of imprints or eliminating acquired epigen-
etic modiﬁcations. The pluripotent inner cell 
mass of the blastocyst erases the epigenetic 
memory before implantation. The epigenetic 
memory is back so embryo cells can achieve 
tissue-speciﬁc patterns.

• Testicular tumors
Testicular tumors are detected in 30- to 40-
year old individuals. Two signiﬁcant risk factors 
are cryptorchidism and gonadal dysgenesis 
(for example, Klinefelter’s syndrome or the tes-
ticular feminization syndrome). An increase in 
X-chromosome number is a common feature 
of testicular germ cell tumors. Serum tumor 
markers are (cid:95)-fetoprotein (AFP), the (cid:96) subunit 
of human chorionic gonadotropin ((cid:96)-hCG) and 
lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1.
  Testicular tumors are classiﬁed into three 
major groups:
  (1) Seminomas.
  (2) Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs).

  (3) Sex cord cell tumors.
  Seminoma occurs in younger  patients and 
is the most common testicular tumor. Serum 
levels of (cid:96)-hCG are moderately elevated. 
  Spermatocytic seminoma is regarded as 
a variant of seminoma. It is seen in older 
patients. 
  TGCTs include  testicular intraepithelial neo-
plasia (TIN), embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, 
choriocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumor.
  TIN (also called intratubular germ cell neo-
plasia) is the initial phase of invasive TGCTs 
that develops in 70% of the cases after an 
average of 7 years. Tumor cells stain positive 
for membrane-associated placental-like alka-
line phosphatase (PLAP) and c-kit receptor. As 
you remember, c-kit receptor is expressed in 
PGCs and differentiating spermatogonia.

  Male infertility is associated with TIN, a 
clinical observation to be taken into account 
during the differential diagnostic process in all 
young men. Radical orchiectomy is gener-
ally performed through an inguinal incision. 
Organ-preserving surgery is an alternative to 
orchiectomy in patients who want to father 
children and the TIN has a reduced size.

  TGCTs correlate with all kinds of X chromo-
some gains. In fact, the gene TGCT1 located 
to the long arm (Xq27) appears associated 
with a risk of bilateral TGCTs, presumably 
mediated by the increased expression of two 
X chromosome-linked oncogenes (ARAF1, 
encoding a serine/threonine kinase, and 
ELK1, a transcription factor). In a few patients, 
germ cell tumors may have an extragonadal 
localization (in the retroperitoneum or medi-
astinum) in addition to TIN. Remember that 
primordial germinal cells that do not reach the 
gonadal ridges during gonadogenesis and are 
not destroyed by apoptosis can give rise to 
germ cell tumors.
  Embryonal carcinoma consists of epithelial 
cells arranged in cords. The tumor cells show 
large nuclei with an irregular outline and 
noticeable nucleoli. Tumor cells are PLAP- and 
cytokeratin-positive.
  Teratoma is a benign germ cell tumor de-
rived from a combination of the tissues from 
all three embryonic layers (ectoderm, meso-
derm, and endoderm). Teratomas are seen in 
prepubertal and postpubertal patients. 
  Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor with 
trophoblastic cells found in teenagers. In con-
trast to germ cell tumors, it presents metasta-
sis before a testicular mass is found. Serum 
levels of (cid:96)-HCG are signiﬁcantly elevated and 
gynecomastia is frequent. 
  Yolk sac tumor is the most common testicu-
lar tumor of childhood. The tumor consists of 
blood vessels surrounded by squamous tu-
mor cells organizing glomerular-like structures 
known as Schiller-Duval bodies.
  Sex cord cell tumors include Leydig cell 
tumor and Sertoli cell tumor. 
  Leydig cell tumor, the most frequent sex 
cord cell tumor, is seen at any age. Sertoli cell 
tumor are generally benign and small. Tumor 
cells are vimentin- and cytokeratin-positive.

20. SPERMATOGENESIS

Essential concepts

21. Sperm Transport and Maturation

Mature spermatids released from the seminiferous tubules complete, as sperm, a maturation process in the 
epididymal duct consisting in the acquisition of forward motility, essential for eventual fertilization. Secretions 
from the epididymal duct, combined mainly with additional products of the prostate and seminal vesicles, 
contribute to the maturation and viability of the male gamete. This chapter starts by reviewing the major de-
velopmental steps of the gonads and excurrent (efferent) ducts. This review will lead us to an understanding 
of the histology, function, and clinical signiﬁcance of the pathway followed by male and female gametes in the 
pursuit of fertilization.

Development of the gonads
An  important  aspect  of  gonadogenesis  is  that  the 
cell  precursors  of  the  male  and  female  gametes 
migrate  from  the  primary  ectoderm  into  the  wall 
of the yolk sac to become extra-embryonic. Bone 
morphogenetic protein, together with signals from 
the extraembryonic mesoderm and visceral endoderm 
specify pluripotent epiblast cells to become primor-
dial germinal cells (PGCs). PGCs appear ﬁrst in the 
primitive streak and endoderm in the 4-week embryo 
(Figure 21-1). 

The  induction  of  epiblast  cells  to  PGCs  is  at 
the  level  of  transcription  regulation  mediated  by 
BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation pro-
tein  1).  BLIMP1  stimulates  the  expression  of  the 
PGC–speciﬁc gene Stella. Stella maintains the plu-
ripotent state of the migrating PGCs by repressing 
transcription of genes speciﬁc to somatic cells. A lack 
of BLIMP1 prevents the appropriate differentiation 
and migration of PGCs. 

Between 4 and 6 weeks, about 10 to 100 PGCs mi-
grate by ameboid movements from the yolk sac back 
to the embryo into the wall of the rectum tube and 
from there to the right and left sides of the gonadal 
ridges through the dorsal mesentery.  The initiation of 
PGC migration is regulated by the cell surface protein 
IFITM1 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1). 
A lack of IFITM1 protein prevents PGCs to migrate 
into the endoderm. On migration of the PGCs to the 
genital ridge, the expression of Stella persists.

How do PGCs ﬁnd their way to the gonadal ridges 
along the complex journey? There is a chemoattrac-
tant system that guides PGCs to the gonadal ridges:
1.  SDF1  (stromal-derived  factor  1)  is  expressed 
at the gonadal ridges and in the surrounding mes-
enchyme.

2.  The chemokine CXCR4, expressed by PGCs, 

is the receptor for SDF1.

A lack of SDF1 or CXCR4 causes very few PGCs 
to  reach  the  gonadal  ridges.  If  there  is  an  ectopic 
expression of SDF1, PGCs migrate to ectopic sites. 

PGCs that do not reach the gonadal ridges undergo 
apoptosis. Bax, a member of the Bcl2 protein fam-
ily, initiates the apoptotic cascade. Yet, some PGCs 
avoid apoptosis and can later give rise to extragonadal 
germ cell tumors.

As  PGCs    migrate,  they  proliferate  by  mitotic 
division. PGCs reach the gonadal ridges by the 6th 
week and continue their proliferation as they interact 
with somatic cells to develop the indifferent gonads.
There  are  at  least  three  additional  factors  that 

participate in the migration of PGCs:

1. The rate of migration and proliferation of PGCs 
are dependent on the interaction of the c-kit receptor, 
a tyrosine kinase, with its corresponding cell mem-
brane ligand, stem cell factor (or c-kit ligand). The 
c-kit receptor is produced by PGCs; stem cell factor is 
produced by somatic cells  along the migration route. 
A  lack  of  the  c-kit  receptor  or  stem  cell  factor 
results in gonads deﬁcient in PGCs because they 
migrate  at  a  signiﬁcant  reduced  rate.  As  we  have 
already  seen,  hematopoiesis  and  the  development 
of melanocytes and mast cells depend on the c-kit 
receptor and its stem cell ligand.

2. E-cadherin expressed by PGCs is required as 

PGCs migrate to the hindgut.

3. PGCs express (cid:96)1 integrin, also required for entry 

to the gonadal ridges.

About 2500 to 5000 PGCs lodge in the mesen-
chyme  and  induce  cells  of  the  mesonephros  and 
lining  coelomic  epithelium  to  proliferate,  forming 
a pair of gonadal ridges. Coelomic epithelial cords 
grow  into  the  mesenchyme  of  the  gonadal  ridge 
to form an outer cortex and inner medulla of the 
indifferent gonad.

Testis-determining factor controls the development 
of the testes  
Until the seventh week  of fetal development, there 
is one type of gonad common to both genders. This 
is the “indifferent” stage of gonadal development.

Thereafter, in the female, the cortex develops into

gene.  SRY is also known as testicular-determining 
factor.

the development of testicular cords, the precursors 
of  the  seminiferous  tubules.  We  have  learned  in 
Chapter 4, Connective Tissue, that Sox9 participates 
in chondrogenesis, by enabling cells in the perichon-
drium to differentiate into chondrocytes.  Therefore, 
Sox9 is  important for the development of the male 
reproductive system and the skeleton. 

The  initial  step  of  testicular  development  is  the  
differentiation of the Sertoli cell population regulated 
by  the Y  chromosome.  Fetal  Sertoli  cells,  in  turn, 
regulate  the  differentiation  of  the  mesenchymal–
derived Leydig cells, that initially proliferate under 
the inﬂuence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). 

Box 21-A  |  Development of internal genitalia: Highlights to remember

•  When Sertoli cell–derived AMH is not present, the müllerian ducts become the 
fallopian tubes (oviducts), uterus, cervix, and upper one third of the vagina.
•  When Leydig cell–derived testosterone is present, the wolfﬁan ducts become 
the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.
•  When steroid 5-(cid:95) reductase (SRD5A) is present, testosterone is converted 
into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT induces the genital tubercle, genital fold, 
genital swelling, and urogenital sinus to become the penis, scrotum, and pros-
tate.
•  When DHT is not present, the genital tubercle, genital fold, genital swelling, 
and urogenital sinus become the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, and lower 
two thirds of the vagina.

AMH inhibits the development of 

the embryonic müllerian duct 
derivatives (oviduct, uterus, and 

cervix).

Fetal precursors of peritubular myoid cells and the 
vasculature develop around the testicular cords. 

Fetal Leydig cells produce testosterone stimulated 
by luteinizing hormone produced by the fetal adeno-
hypophysis.  Testosterone production ceases postna-
tally, reassumes at puberty and continues throughout 
adulthood.

Spermatogonial stem cells  (SSCs), derived from 
PGCs, are mitotically quiescent and located in the 
center of the testicular cords surrounded by mitoti-
cally  dividing  Sertoli  cells  (see  Figure  21-1).  Close 
to puberty, SSCs migrate to the future seminiferous 
tubular wall and initiate their mitotic ampliﬁcation 
cycle, the starting point of spermatogenesis.  

A loss of Sox9 function results in XY gonadal dys-
genesis in which patients have undeveloped gonadal 
structures (streak gonads) and absence of virilization 
(persistence of müllerian-derived structures). Muta-
tions of the Sox9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia 
involving skeletal abnormalities.

Development of male and female internal genitalia
The fetal testis is formed by testicular cords connected 
to the rete testis by tubuli recti. The cords are formed 
by Sertoli cells, derived from the coelomic epithelium, 
and SSCs. Leydig cells, derived from the mesonephric 
mesenchyme, are present between the testicular cords.

Male internal genitalia 

  21. SPERM TRANSPORT AND MATURATION

647

Fetal Sertoli cells secrete anti-müllerian hormone 
(AMH), which prevents müllerian ducts (also called 
paramesonephric  ducts)  from  developing  into  the 
uterovaginal  primordium  (Figure  21-2).  In  the 
absence  of  AMH,  the  müllerian  ducts  persist  and 
become the female internal genitalia. 

By 8 weeks of gestation, fetal Leydig cells produce 
testosterone, which is regulated by placental human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), because the fetal hy-
pophysis is not secreting luteinizing hormone (LH). 
The cephalic end of the wolfﬁan ducts (also called 
mesonephric ducts) forms the epididymis, vas defer-
ens, and ejaculatory duct. A diverticulum of the vas 
deferens forms the seminal vesicles. 

The prostate gland and urethra develop from the 
urogenital sinus. The prostate gland has a dual origin: 
the  glandular  epithelium  forms  from  outgrowths 
of  the  prostatic  urethral  endoderm;  the  stroma 
and  smooth  muscle  derive  from  the  surrounding 
mesoderm. 

In  the  absence  of  androgen,  the  wolfﬁan  duct 
regresses  and  the  prostate  fails  to  develop.  If  high 
levels of androgen are present in the female fetus, 
both müllerian and wolfﬁan ducts can persist (see 
Box 21-A).

Testicular descent
The gubernaculum forms on the lower pole of the 
testis, crosses obliquely through the abdominal wall, 
and  attaches  the  testis  to  the  genital  swelling,  the 
future scrotal sac.  

Between month 3 and 7 of pregnancy, the testis 
remains near the inguinal canal. In month 9 of preg-
nancy or immediately after birth, the testes reach the 
scrotal sac after moving across the inguinal canal. The 
gubernaculum shortens, the vaginal process lengthens 
and  each  testis  is  drawn  into  the  scrotum.  As  the 
vaginal process lengthens, it traps muscle ﬁbers of the 
oblique internal muscle and the transverse muscle to 
form the cremaster muscle. 

For  additional  details,  see  Cryptorchidism  (or 
undescended testis) in Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis.

Clinical signiﬁcance:  Klinefelter’s syndrome
Klinefelter’s syndrome is observed in males with an 
extra X chromosome (47,XXY) as a result of chromo-
somal non-disjunction during male or female meiosis. 

Individuals with this syndrome:
1.  Are  phenotypically  males  (presence  of  the  Y 

chromosome).

2. Have small testes and few spermatogenic cells 

are present.

3. Have high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
levels because the function of Sertoli cells is abnormal 
(failure to produce inhibin).

4. Have low testosterone levels (hypogonadism), 

but high estradiol levels. The excess of estradiol can 
lead to phenotypic feminization, including gyneco-
mastia (breast enlargement).

Klinefelter’s  syndrome  may  remain  undiagnosed 
until  the  patient  consults  because  of  infertility. 
Chromosome analysis (karyotyping), testosterone and 
estrogen determination and sperm count determine 
the nature of the syndrome.  

Klinefelter’s syndrome  increases the risk of testicu-
lar germ cell tumor, breast cancer, attention deﬁcient 
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and  autoimmune 
diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Androgen insensitivity 
syndrome (AIS)
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), or testicular 
feminization (Tfm) syndrome, results from a defect in 
the gene controlling the expression of the androgen 
receptor. This gene is located on the X chromosome. 

Three phenotypes are observed:
1.  Complete  androgen  insensitivity  syndrome 

(CAIS) with female external genitalia.

2. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS, 
Reifenstein syndrome) with predominantly female, 
predominantly male, or ambiguous genitalia.

3. Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS)
with male external genitalia. Spermatogenesis and/or 
pubertal virilization may be impaired.

 Although the karyotype is 46,XY, a deﬁciency in 
the action of androgen results in the lack of develop-
ment of the wolfﬁan duct and regression of the mül-
lerian  duct  because  testes  development  takes  place 
and Sertoli cell–derived AMH is available. 

No  functional  internal  genitalia  are  present  in 
patients with CAIS: the testes remain in the abdomen 
(recall that androgens stimulate testicular descent). 
Inguinal hernia with testes can be detected during 
a physical examination. The testes may be removed 
after puberty (until feminization is complete) because 
of the risk of testicular cancer, just like in the unde-
scended testis condition.

The external genitalia develop as female but no 
uterus is present. Individuals with complete AIS have 
labia, a clitoris, and a short vagina (these structures are 
not müllerian duct derivatives). Pubic and axillary hair 
is absent (sexual hair development is androgen-de-
pendent). Individuals with PAIS may have male and 
female physical characteristics (ambiguous genitalia).
At puberty, the production of both androgen and 
estradiol  increases  (the  latter  from  peripheral  aro-
matization of androgens). Androgens cannot inhibit 
LH secretion (because a defective androgen receptor 
prevents LH feedback inhibition), and plasma levels 
of androgens remain high.

AIS can be diagnosed by pelvic ultrasound, hor-

monal determinations and chromosome analysis.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Steroid 5(cid:95)-reductase 2 
deﬁciency
There are three isoenzymes of steroid 5(cid:95)-reductase 
(SRD5A):  SRD5A1,  SRD5A2,  and  SRD5A3.  A 
defect in the activity of SRD5A2 results in decreased 
conversion of testosterone to the more potent andro-
gen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in individuals with 
SRD5A deﬁciency. 

Individuals with mutations of the SRD5A2 gene, 
located  on  the  short  arm  of  chromosome  2,  are 
genetically males. Affected individuals have normal 
internal  genitalia  (whose  development  from  the 
wolfﬁan duct is androgen-dependent) but nonmas-
culinized  external  genitalia  (whose  development 
is  DHT-dependent). They  are  often  mistaken  for 
females at birth. 

Although  the  external  genitalia  may  be  female, 
the vagina consists of only the lower two-thirds of a 
normal vagina, creating a blind-ending vaginal pouch 
(see Box 21-A). Because Sertoli cell–derived AMH 
is present and determines the regression of the mül-
lerian duct, individuals with SRD5A2 deﬁciency lack 
a uterus and oviducts.

Individuals with SRD5A2 deﬁciency can produce 
sperm but fertility is compromised by a lack of devel-
opment of seminal vesicles and prostate. In addition, 
SRD5A2 deﬁciency is associated with an increased 
risk of cryptorchidism and testicular cancer. 

The discovery of congenital SRD5A2 deﬁciency 
made possible a better understanding of two androgen 
hormones: testosterone and DHT, in the drug therapy 
of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer as

Several efferent ductules arise from the rete 
testis and then become confluent with the 
highly coiled epididymal duct. The efferent 
ductules are lined by a pseudostratified 
epithelium with a distinctive scalloped outline. 
The epithelium consists of: (1) principal cells 
with microvilli; (2) ciliated cells and (3) basal 
cells. Cilia, beating toward the epididymis, 
propel the incoming sperm.

region. As indicated in Chapter 1, Epithelium, 
stereocilia is an early misnomer as they lack

stereocilia/stereovilli arise from 
the apical domain.  (3) The Golgi 
complex at a supranuclear 
location is very prominent. (4) 
Secretion of glycoproteins, 
endocytosis, and pinocytosis are 
prevalent. (5) About 90% of the 
testicular fluid is absorbed in the 
ductuli efferentes and epididymis 
by principal cells. 
    The basal cells are associated 
with the basal lamina.

SRD5A2 gene (by single amino acid substitutions) 
may be associated with the risk of developing pros-
tate cancer or having an aggressive form of the tumor.

 

Sperm maturation pathway 
After transport to the rete testis through a connect-
ing tubulus rectus (Figure 21-3), mature spermatids 

(or immature sperm)  enter the ductuli efferentes. 

Ductuli  efferentes  link  the  rete  testis  to  the  ini-
tial  segment  of  the  epididymal  duct,  an  irregularly 
coiled duct extending to the ductus, or vas deferens. 
Remember that the epididymal duct and ductus or

mediastinum of the testis. They are lined by a simple 
cuboidal epithelium with structural features similar 
to those of Sertoli cells except that occluding junc-
tions are now at the apical domain, instead of at the 
basal domain. Spermatogenic cells are not present.
The rete testis consists of irregularly anastomos-
ing channels within the mediastinum of the testis 
(Figure 21-4).  These channels are lined by a simple 
cuboidal epithelium. The wall, formed by ﬁbroblasts 
and  smooth  muscle  cells,  is  surrounded  by  large 
lymphatic channels and blood vessels associated with 
large clusters of Leydig cells (see Figure 21-3).

About  12  to  20  ductuli  efferentes  (efferent 
ductules) link the rete testis to the epididymis after 
piercing the testicular tunica albuginea. Each ductule 
is lined by:

Box 21-B  |  Epididymal duct: Highlights to remember

The epididymis has three main functions: 
•  Sperm transport by peristalsis to the storage region, the tail of the epididymis.  
The time of sperm epididymal maturation is from 2 to 12 days.
•  Sperm storage until ejaculation. 
•  Sperm maturation. Sperm collected from the head region of the epididymis 
are unable to fertilize. The fertilizing ability is acquired from the body to the tail 
of the epididymis. 
   Sperm maturation includes: 
   1. Stabilization of condensed chromatin. 
   2. Changes in plasma membrane surface charge. 
   3. Acquisition by sperm of new surface proteins.
   4. Acquisition of sperm forward motility.
•  The development of the epididymal ducts, derived from the wolfﬁan ducts, 
requires normal expression of Homeobox A10 (Hoxa10) and Hoxa11 genes. 
Mutations in the genes encoding bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) 4, Bmp7, 
and Bmp8 result in the defective differentiation of speciﬁc segments of the 
epididymal duct.

    21. SPERM TRANSPORT AND MATURATION

Spermatic cord

1.  Columnar cells with microvilli/stereocilia, with 

a role in the reabsorption of  ﬂuid from the lumen.

2. Ciliated cells, which contribute to the transport 

of nonmotile sperm toward the epididymis. 

3. Basal cells, the cell precursor of the ciliated and 

nonciliated epithelial cells. 

The pseudostratiﬁed epithelium has a character-
istic scalloped outline that enables identiﬁcation of 
the ductuli efferentes (see Figure 21-4). A thin inner 
circular layer of smooth muscle cells underlies the 
epithelium and its basal lamina.

Androgen-binding  protein,  produced  by  Sertoli 
cells, binds androgens.  The protein-steroid complex 
is present in the lumen of the rete testis and the initial 
segments of the epididymis. Consequently, the rete 
testis  contains  a  larger  concentration  of  androgens 
than arterial blood. Intraluminal androgens appear 
to  favor  the  normal  function  of  the  head  of  the 
epididymis.

The epididymal ducts
The  epididymides  (Greek  epi,  following;  didymos, 
pair)  (Pl epididymides) are a highly elongated and 
coiled tubules (about 6 meters in length in the adult 
human) where sperm mature. 

Sperm  maturation  consists  in  the  acquisition  of 
forward motility, essential to sperm fertilizing ability. 
Mature sperm are stored in the terminal portion of 
the epididymal duct before ejaculation. 

The epididymal duct is classically subdivided into 

three major segments: 

1. The head or caput.
2. The body or corpus.
3. The tail or cauda (see Figure 21-4).
The epithelium is pseudostratiﬁed columnar with

epithelium surrounded by connective tissue and bundles of smooth muscle.

sists of two major cell types (Figure 21-5):

1. Columnar principal cells, extending from the 
lumen  to  the  basal  lamina. The  apical  domain  of 
principal cells displays branched stereocilia/stereovilli 
and  a  well-developed  Golgi  apparatus,  lysosomes, 
and vesicles. 

2. Basal cells associated with the basal lamina. Basal 
cells are regarded as the undifferentiated precursors 
of principal cells. 

Other  cell  types  are  the  apical  cells,  rich  in  mi-
tochondria  and  predominant  in  the  head  of  the 
epididymis, and the clear cells, predominant in the 
tail of the epididymis. Intraepithelial lymphocytes 
are  distributed  throughout  the  epididymis. They 
may be an important component of the epididymal 
immunologic barrier. 

The height of the epithelium varies with respect 
to the segment of the epididymal duct. The epithe-

Box 21-C  |  Seminal plasma (semen)

•  The seminal plasma or semen consists of the combination of alkaline secre-
tions of epididymal epithelium and the accessory glands (predominantly the 
prostate and seminal vesicles). The fresh ejaculate coagulates within one minute 
in the vaginal cavity and neutralizes the acidic contents of the vagina. Proteases 
(ﬁbrinolysin and ﬁbrinogenase) present in the prostate secretions change the 
coagulated ejaculate to a ﬂuid state after 15 to 20 minutes.
• Proteins of the seminal plasma coat the sperm plasma membrane and supply 
nutrients, including fructose, and activator of sperm forward motility. 
• Seminal vesicles contribute about 75% of the volume of the seminal plasma; 
about 20-25% of the volume derives from the prostate gland.

lium is taller in the head region and shorter in the 
tail region. In an opposite fashion, the lumen of the 
epididymal  duct  is  narrow  in  the  head  region  and 
wider in the tail region. 

Regional  differences  exist  in  the  organization  of 
the  smooth  muscle  cell  layer,  responsible  for  the 
rhythmic  peristaltic  contractions  moving  sperm 
along the epididymal duct (see  Box 21-B). The ini-
tial portions of the epididymal duct are surrounded 
by a circular smooth muscle cell layer. The terminal 
portions (body and tail) display an increase in the 
thickness of the inner circular smooth muscle layer 
and  the development of an outer longitudinal smooth 
muscle cell layer.

The vas deferens (ductus deferens) is a 45-cm-long 

muscular tube with the following features: 

1. The lining epithelium is pseudostratiﬁed colum-
nar with stereocilia/stereovilli similar to that of the 
epididymis, and is supported by a connective tissue 
lamina propria with elastic ﬁbers.

2. The muscular  wall  consists of inner and outer 
layers of longitudinally oriented muscle separated by 
a middle circular layer.

3. The external layer consists of loose connective 

tissue and adipose cells. 

In addition to the vas deferens, the spermatic cord 

contains the following components (Figure 21-6): 

1. The cremaster muscle.
2.  Arteries  (spermatic  artery,  cremasteric  artery, 

and artery to the vas deferens).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Causes of male infertility
We have seen that the SRY gene, located on the Y 
chromosome,  encodes  a  transcription  factor  called 
sex-determining  region  Y  protein  responsible,  to-
gether with Sox9, for the development of the testes. 

654

    21. SPERM TRANSPORT AND MATURATION

Seminal vesicles

A fetus with a mutation in the SRY gene develops as 
a female despite having a Y chromosome.

The Y chromosome also harbors the azoospermia 
factor (AZF) region  gene, a determinant of spermato-
genesis. Deletions in the AZF region, located in the 
long arm of human Y chromosome, are implicated 
in male infertility. 

There are three AZF regions: AZFa, AZFb, and 
AZFc. Each AZF region contains several genes with 
a role in spermatogenesis. 

Deletions of the AZFa region are less frequent and 
account for the Sertoli cell–only syndrome (SCOS; 
see Chapter 20, Spermatogenesis). 

AZFb deletions are associated with meiotic arrest 

(spermatocytes). 

Deletions of the AZFc region result in a reduction 
in sperm production (oligozoospermia) and can be 
transmitted to the offspring. Males with Y chromo-
some infertility have small testes and short stature.
Y chromosome infertility is characterized by azo-
ospermia (absence of sperm) and oligozoospermia 
(less than 15 million sperm/mL of semen). Normal 
sperm count is 20-40 million sperm/mL of semen.

In addition to deletions in the AZF region of the Y 
chromosome, other causes of male infertility include:

1. Obstruction of the ejaculatory duct.
2.  Cystic  ﬁbrosis  transmembrane  conductance 
regulator (CFTR)–related disorders, including cystic 
ﬁbrosis and congenital bilateral absence of the vas 
deferens (because of the atrophy, ﬁbrosis and absence 
of wolfﬁan–derived structures). Affected men have 
azoospermia.

3.  Bilateral  viral  orchitis  (mumps),  epididymitis 

and urethritis.

4. Chemotherapy or exposure to radiation.
5. Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY). 
6. Sertoli cell–only syndrome (SCOS).

Accessory genital glands
The accessory glands of the male reproductive tract 
include two seminal vesicles, the prostate gland,  two 
bulbourethral glands of Cowper and urethral glands 
of Littré (the latter also present in the female urethra).
 The seminal vesicles and the prostate produce most 
of the seminal ﬂuid, and their function is regulated 
by androgens (testosterone and DHT).

Seminal vesicles
The seminal vesicles are androgen-dependent organs. 
Each seminal vesicle is an outpocketing of the wall 
of ampulla of each vas deferens. It consists of three 
components (Figure 21-8): 

1. An external connective tissue capsule.
2. A middle smooth muscle layer (inner circular 

and outer longitudinal layers).

3.  An  internal  highly  folded  mucosa  lined  by 

a  simple  cuboidal-to-pseudostratified  columnar 
epithelium.

The epithelial cells display a large Golgi apparatus 
with  vesicles  containing  seminal  vesicle  secretory 
(SVS) granules (coagulating proteins). Seminal ves-
icles secrete an alkaline viscous ﬂuid rich in fructose  
and prostaglandins. The ﬂuid contributes about 75% 
of the human ejaculate. 

Fructose  is  the  major  source  of  energy  of  the 
ejaculated sperm. Seminal vesicles do not store sperm. 
They contract during ejaculation and their secretion 
contributes to the semen. 

The  excretory  duct  of  each  seminal  vesicle  pen-
etrates the prostate after joining the ampulla of the vas 
deferens/deferent duct to form the ejaculatory duct 
(see Figures 21-7 and 21-8; see Box 21-C). 

Prostate gland
The prostate is the largest accessory genital gland sur-
rounded by a capsule. It consists of  30 to 50 branched 
tubuloalveolar glands that empty their contents into 
the prostate urethra via long excretory ducts. 

The  male  urethra  consists  of  four  segments  (see 

Figure 21-8): 

1.  Preprostatic  urethra,  a  short  segment  (1  cm) 
surrounded by the internal urethral sphincter (smooth 
muscle  cells)  that,  when  contracted,  prevents  the 
retrograde  ﬂow  of  semen  into  the  urinary  bladder 
during ejaculation. 

2.  Prostatic  urethra,  a  3  to  4  cm  long  segment 
embedded in the prostate gland, is the end site of 
prostatic ducts transporting glandular secretions, and 
the ejaculatory ducts, carrying semen and secretions 
of the seminal vesicles during ejaculation.

3. Membranous urethra is a segment that crosses 
through the deep perineal pouch and is surrounded 
by skeletal muscle of the external urethral sphincter.
4. Penile urethra (spongy urethra), surrounded by 
erectile tissue (the corpus spongiosum) of the penis.
Remember the segmental distribution of the male 
urethra because it will become useful when perform-
ing  urethral  cathetherization  to  drain  urine  from 
patients unable to micturate.

The  prostate  glands  are  arranged  in  three  zones 

(Figure 21-9): 

1.  A  central  zone  with    periurethral  mucosal 

glands.

2. A transition zone with periurethral submucosal 

glands.

3. A peripheral zone consisting of branched (com-
pound) glands. About 70% to 80% of prostate cancer 
originates in the peripheral zone.  

The prostate glands are lined by simple or pseu-
dostratiﬁed  columnar  epithelium  (Figure  21-10). 
The lumen contains concretions (corpora amylacea) 
rich in glycoproteins and, sometimes, a site of calcium

Figure 21-10. Prostate tubuloalveolar glands

Prostate gland 

The prostate is a muscular and glandular organ. It consists 
of three groups of glands: (1) periurethral mucosal glands 
(in the central zone); (2) periurethral submucosal glands, 
linked to the urethra by short ducts (in the transition zone); 
and (3) main prostatic glands (in the peripheral zone). 
About 30 to 50 tubuloalveolar glands open directly into the 
prostatic urethra through 15 to 30 long ducts ending at the 
sides of the urethral crest. 
    The epithelium of the main prostatic glands is simple 
columnar or pseudostratified and arranged into folds 
supported by a lamina propria. The lumen may contain 
corpora amylacea, a condensed structure rich in 
glycoproteins and cell fragments, with a tendency to calcify 
in older men.
    The secretion of the prostate contains fibrinolysin, with a 
role in the liquefaction of semen. Citric acid, zinc, amylase, 
prostate-specific antigen, and acid phosphatase are 
present in high concentrations in prostate fluid secreted in 
the semen.

Prostate-specific antigen screening

Although the digital rectal examination (DRE) has been the 
primary screening test for prostate cancer, a large number 
of cancers detected by this method are at an advanced 
stage. Prostate-specific antigen blood testing (PSA) was 
introduced in the late 1980s to increase early-stage cancer 
detection of prostate cancer as compared to DRE. Values 
above 4 ng/ml, considered to be abnormal, are associated 
with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis or 
cystitis (false-positive).  A normal PSA value does not rule 
out prostate cancer (false-negative). At present, patients are 
informed about inconsistent evidence of PSA screening.

The  prostate  produces  a  zinc-rich  alkaline  ﬂuid 
that neutralizes the acidic vaginal content, provides 
nutrients and transports sperm, and liqueﬁes semen. 
Protein  products  include  prostate-speciﬁc  acid 
phosphatase,  prostate-specific  antigen  (PSA,  a 
marker for early detection of prostate cancer), amy-
lase, and ﬁbrinolysin. 

Pathology: Benign prostate hyperplasia
Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a condition that 
occurs with aging, is a noncancerous enlargement of 
the prostate gland that can restrict the ﬂow of urine 
through the prostatic urethra. 

The periurethral mucosal (central zone) and sub-
mucosal (transition zone) prostate glands and cells of 
the stroma undergo nodular hyperplasia  (see Figure 
21-9) in older men. 

Periurethral nodular hyperplasia produces: 
1. Difﬁculty in urination and urinary obstruction 

caused  by  partial  or  complete  compression  of  the 
prostatic urethra by the nodular growth. 

2. Retention of urine in the bladder or inability to 
empty the urinary bladder completely.  The possibil-
ity of infection leads to inﬂammation of the urinary 
bladder (cystitis) and urinary tract infection (pyelo-
nephritis).  Acute  and  persistent  urinary  retention 
requires emergency urethral catheterization.

BPH is attributed to DHT, a metabolite of tes-
tosterone. (Figure 21-11). DHT is converted in the 
prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of 
the enzyme SRD5A2 (steroid 5(cid:95)-reductase type 2). 
This enzyme is localized predominantly in the stromal 
cells, the predominant androgen conversion site. The 
participation  of  DHT  in  determining  periurethral 
nodular hyperplasia  is supported by the clinical use 
of ﬁnasteride, an  inhibitor of SRD5A that lowers 
DHT levels of the prostate, reduces prostate size and 
alleviates to a large extent BPH symptoms.

There  are  two  Federal  Drug  Administration 
(FDA)-approved SRD5A inhibitors: ﬁnasteride in-

      Because prostate stromal cells, 
1
but not prostate epithelial cells, 
contain steroid 5(cid:95)-reductase 2 
(SRD5A2), they are the main source 
of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 
neighboring prostate epithelial cells.  
DHT acts in a paracrine fashion on 
prostate epithelial cells. Prostate 
epithelial cells contain SRD5A3 that 
can also convert testosterone to 
DHT (not shown in the diagram).     
    Like prostate epithelial cells, 
prostate stromal cells can also 
produce growth factors with  
paracrine and autocrine effects (not 
shown).

       Inactive androgen receptor (AR) 
2
in prostate epithelial cells is bound to 
heat-shock proteins (mainly HSP90). 
DHT binds to AR, that dimerizes 
after dissociation from HSPs.

       The DHT-AR dimer complex 
3
translocates to the nucleus of the 
prostate epithelial cell, associates 
with other transcription factors, 
including ETS factors, binds to 
androgen-response elements on 
DNA and induces the production of 
mitogenic growth factors to stimulate 
cell survival and growth.
    Therapy with inhibitors of SRD5A 
reduces the production of DHT, the 
synthesis of mitogenic growth 
factors, and decreases the size of 
the nodular hyperplasia and urinary 
obstruction.

        Controlling AR activity has become the prevalent strategy of 
prostate cancer treatment.  A mutated AR can be activated by 
several non-androgen ligands and regulate prostate cancer 
development not only transcription but also regulation of genomic 
stability and DNA repair. Also, deregulated mitogenic growth factors 
can activate AR in the presence of low levels of DHT, turning 
prostate cancer refractory to SRD5A inhibition therapy 
(castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC).

Induced growth factor binds to 
the specific receptor (autocrine 

effect) and stimulates cell 

growth  

hibits the SRD5A2 isoenzyme, leading to decreases 
in serum dihydrotestosterone levels by 70 to 90%, 
whereas dutasteride blocks SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 
isoenzymes,  reducing  dihydrotestosterone  to  levels 
close to zero. 

Rectal  examination  (palpation  of  the  prostate 
through the rectum) may reveal a markedly enlarged 
prostate. Transrectal ultrasonography and determi-
nation of blood levels of prostate speciﬁc antigen 
(PSA) are indicated to rule out prostate cancer.

Pathology: Prostate cancer

The enzyme SRD5A2, present mainly in prostate 
stromal  cells,  converts  testosterone  to  DHT.    As 
discussed earlier in this chapter, a congenital lack of 
SRD5A2 results in a vestigial prostate gland. Castra-
tion in a man leads to atrophy of the prostate gland.
Testosterone and DHT bind to androgen receptors 

(ARs). We have seen from AIS (androgen insensitivity 
syndrome) that the AR has an important role in the 
development of the prostate gland. In addition, AR  
activity plays an important role at different stages of 
prostate cancer.  

In its inactive state, AR forms in the cytoplasm a 
complex with heat shock proteins (HSPs), including 
HSP90, when  testosterone or DHT are not present 
(see Figure 21-11).

Upon  binding  of  androgens,  transported  to  the 
prostate  gland  by  the  bloodstream  bound  to  sex 
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the AR detaches 
from HSPs, forms dimers that bind to the androgen 
and the androgen-AR dimer complex translocates to 
the nucleus.

In  the  nucleus,  AR,  regarded  as  a  transcription 
factor, binds to DNA and to transcription factors, 
including ETS (for E26), to induce the expression of

autocrine and paracrine survival and growth factors 
to prostate epithelial cells and prostate stromal cells.
Note that androgen binding triggers dimerization 
of AR and translocation to the nucleus. Therefore, the 
major therapeutic objective is to prevent androgen 
binding to AR to block dimerization, nuclear trans-
location  and  eventual  transcription  of  genes  that 
depend on AR during prostate cancer development.
In addition to the classical AR activation follow-
ing androgen binding, additional changes take place 
during prostate cancer progression:

1. Overexpression  of  AR is able to increase the 
activity of cell cycle regulators that can turn cell prolif-
eration refractory to androgen deprivation therapy (a 
clinical condition called castration-resistant prostate 
cancer, CRPC).

2. Expression of AR splice variants can lack an 
androgen-binding  domain  without  affecting  the 
recruitment of AR to DNA. This event can induce 
genomic reprogramming leading to the down regula-
tion of repressors or maximizing the expression of AR 
co-regulators, including ETS transcription factors.
3.  Mutations  that  uphold  AR  activity  by  con-
version  of  antagonistic  drug  responses  to  agonist 
responses.

Prostate cancer originates from the main prostate 
glands of the peripheral zone, farthest from the ure-
thra. Urinary symptoms are not present at the early 
stage and tumor growth is often detected by digital 
palpation of the prostate, by elevated serum levels of 
PSA, or by back pain caused by vertebral metasta-
sis. Transperineal or transrectal biopsy, if required, 
conﬁrm a clinical diagnosis.

Surgery  (radical  prostatectomy  by  retropubic  or 
perineal  surgery)  and  radiotherapy  (external  beam 
radiation therapy or radioactive seed implants in the 
prostate) are appropriate when the tumor is localized 
as determined by computer imaging techniques.

Male and female urethra
The urethra in the male is 20 cm long and, as already 
described, it has four segments: preprostatic urethra, 
prostatic urethra, membranous urethra and penile or 
spongy urethra (see Figure 21-8). 

The penile urethra receives the excretory ducts of 
the bulbourethral gland (of Cowper; Figure 21-12) 
and the urethral glands (of Littré). 

Urethral  glands  produce  a  glycosaminoglycan-
containing secretion that protects and lubricates the 
surface of the urethral epithelium. 

The epithelium of the prostate urethra is transi-
tional (urothelium). It changes to a pseudostratiﬁed-
to-stratiﬁed columnar epithelium in the membranous 
and penile urethra. The muscle layer in the membra-
nous urethra consists of  a  smooth muscle sphincter 
(involuntary) and a striated muscle sphincter (vol-

untary). It controls the passage of urine or semen.

The urethra in the female is 4 cm long and is lined 
by transitional epithelium changing to pseudostrati-
ﬁed columnar and stratiﬁed squamous nonkeratinized 
epithelium near the urethral meatus. 

The mucosa contains mucus-secreting glands (see 
Figure 21-12). An inner layer of smooth muscle is 
surrounded by a circular layer of striated muscle that 
closes the urethra when contracted.

Bulbourethral glands
The bulbourethral glands consist of several lobules 
containing  tubuloalveolar  secretory  units  and  a 
main excretory duct lined by a stratiﬁed columnar 
epithelium. 

The  lining  epithelium  of  the  secretory  units  is 
columnar and secretes a mucus product. The secre-
tion, containing abundant galactose and a moderate 
amount of sialic acid, is discharged into the penile 
urethra. This  secretion  has  a  lubrication  function 
and precedes the emission of semen along the penile 
urethra (see Figure 21-8).

Penis
The  penis  consists  of  three  cylindrical  columnar 
masses of erectile tissue (see Figure 21-12): the right 
and left corpora cavernosa, and the ventral corpus 
spongiosum, transversed by the penile urethra. The 
three  columns  converge  to  form  the  shaft  of  the 
penis. The distal tip of the corpus spongiosum is the 
glans penis.

The  corpora  cavernosa  and  corpus  spongiosum 
contain irregular and communicating blood spaces, 
or sinusoids, supplied by an artery and drained by 
venous channels. During erection, arterial blood ﬁlls 
the sinusoids, which enlarge and compress the drain-
ing venous channels (Figure 21-13).
Two chemicals control erection: 
1. Nitric oxide.
2. Phosphodiesterase (see Figure 21-13). 
Sexual  stimulation,  via  the  cerebral  cortex  and 
hypothalamus and transported down the spinal cord 
to autonomic nerves in the penis, causes the branches 
of the dorsal nerve, the end point of the pudendal 
nerve, to produce nitric oxide. 

Nitric oxide molecules spread rapidly across gap 
junctions of smooth muscle cells surrounding the 
blood sinusoids. 

Within smooth muscle cells, nitric oxide molecules 
activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP).

 cGMP relaxes the smooth muscle cell wall sur-
rounding the sinusoids by inducing the sequestration 
of Ca2+ within intracellular storage sites. The lowered 
concentrations of  Ca2+ determine the relaxation of

The penis consists of three cylindrical masses containing erectile tissue:      
(1) the paired corpora cavernosa, and (2) the single corpus cavernosum or 
spongiosum, which surrounds the penile urethra and ends in the conical glans 
penis. The three cylindrical masses are surrounded by elastic connective 
tissue, the fascia, covered by skin. Each cylinder is surrounded by a dense 
connective tissue capsule, the tunica albuginea.

smooth muscle cells, which leads to the accumula-

arterial blood from the dorsal and cavernous arteries 
(see Figure 21-13). Sinusoids engorged with blood 
compress the small veins that drain blood from the 
penis and the penis becomes erect. 

The enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) is produced 
to destroy cGMP and terminate erection. By blocking 
PDE activity, cGMP levels remain elevated and the 
penis remains erect. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Erectile dysfunction
Factors that affect the cerebral cortex–hypothalamus–
spinal cord–autonomic nerve pathway and vascular 
diseases  can  cause  erectile  dysfunction. Traumatic 
head  and  spinal  cord  injuries,  stroke,  Parkinson’s 
disease, and systemic diseases, such as diabetes and 
multiple sclerosis, reduce nerve function and lead to 
erectile dysfunction. In addition, anxiety disorders can 
be a primary cause of erectile dysfunction.

was  noticed  that  a  signiﬁcant  number  of  patients 
were  getting  erections  after  taking  the  drug. This 
observation initiated an independent clinical study 
to evaluate the effect of sildenaﬁl in the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction.  

In the penis, sildenaﬁl blocks a speciﬁc phospho-

diesterase found in smooth muscle cells, and, by this 
mechanism, inhibits the degradation of cGMP. High 
levels of cGMP induce Ca2+ to enter storage areas in 
the cell and induce the perisinusoidal smooth muscle 
cells to relax. Sildenaﬁl can cause dose-dependent side 
effects such as facial ﬂushing, gastrointestinal distress, 
headaches, and a blue tinge to vision.

Essential concepts

Sperm Transport and Maturation

• Primordial germinal cells (PGCs) have an 
extra-embryonic origin. 
  Precursors of the male and female gametes 
migrate from the primary ectoderm into the 
wall of the yolk sac and become extra-embry-
onic. They appear ﬁrst in the wall of the yolk 
sac in the 4-week embryo.
 Bone morphogenetic protein and signals 
from the extraembryonic mesoderm and 
visceral endoderm specify pluripotent epiblast 
cells to become PGCs.
 BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation 
protein 1) stimulates the expression of the 
PGC–speciﬁc gene Stella. Stella represses 
transcription of genes speciﬁc to somatic cells.   
  Between 4 and 6 weeks, PGCs migrate to 
the gonadal ridges by translocation from the 
yolk sac to the hindgut.

  The initiation of PGC migration is regulated 
by the cell surface protein IFITM1 (interferon-
induced transmembrane protein 1). 
 Migration from the hindgut to the gonadal 
ridges across the mesentery is guided by:
  (1) SDF1 (stromal-derived factor 1),  
expressed at the gonadal ridges and in the 
surrounding mesenchyme.
  (2) The chemokine CXCR4, expressed by 
PGCs.
  There are at least three additional factors that 
participate in the migration of PGCs:
  (1) The rate of migration and proliferation 
of PGCs are dependent on the interaction of 
the c-kit receptor, a tyrosine kinase, with its 
corresponding cell membrane ligand, stem cell 
factor (or c-kit ligand).
  (2) E-cadherin, expressed by PGCs.

  (3) PGCs express (cid:96)1 integrin, required for 
entry to the gonadal ridges.

  PGCs that do not reach the gonadal ridges 
undergo apoptosis. PGCs that avoid apoptosis 
can later give rise to extragonadal germ cell 
tumors.
  PGCs reach the gonadal ridges by the 6th 
week and continue their proliferation as they 
interact with somatic cells to develop the 
indifferent gonads.

  In the gonadal ridges, XX chromosome-
containing PGCs occupy the cortex, and XY 
chromosome-containing PGCs localize in the 
medulla, the central portion of the gonadal 
ridges.  
  After 7 weeks, the indifferent gonad contains 
a cortex, which develops into an ovary, and a

medulla, which develops into a testis.
  The development of the testis is controlled 
by testis-determining factor, a product of a 
gene on the sex-determining region of the Y 
chromosome (SRY).
  The initial components of the fetal testis are 
the testicular cords. A testicular cord contains 
Sertoli cells and spermatogonial stem cells  
(SSCs) derived from PGCs. Leydig cells are 
present between the testicular cords. 
  Fetal Sertoli cells secrete anti-müllerian 
hormone (AMH), which induces regression by 
apoptosis of the müllerian duct (parameso-
nephric duct). 
  Leydig cells, stimulated by human chorionic 
gonadotropin, secrete testosterone. Testos-
terone is converted to dihydrotestosterone 
(DHT) by the enzyme steroid 5(cid:95)-reductase 2 
(SRD5A2). 
  Testosterone stimulates the wolfﬁan duct 
(mesonephric duct) to develop the epididy-
mis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicle. 
  DHT stimulates the development of the 
prostate gland and urethra from the urogenital 
sinus. Testosterone and DHT bind to androgen 
receptor, encoded by a gene on the X chromo-
some.

  Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY) is observed 
in males with an extra X chromosome. Individi-
als are phenotypically males, have atrophic 
testes, and the blood levels of testosterone are 

low but the levels of estradiol are high. Excess 
of estradiol causes gynecomastia.
  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS, also 
called testicular feminization) is determined by 
a complete or partial defect in the expression 
of androgen receptor. A lack of development 
of the wolfﬁan duct and regression of the 
müllerian duct are observed. Testes remain in 
the abdomen, and external genitalia develop as 
female. Blood levels of androgens and estradiol 
are high.
  Three phenotypes are observed:
  (1) Complete androgen insensitivity syn-
drome (CAIS) with female external genitalia. 
The testes remain in the abdomen. They may 
be removed after puberty (until feminization 
is complete) because of the risk of testicular 
cancer.
  (2) Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome 
(PAIS, Reifenstein syndrome) with predomi-
nantly female or male, or ambiguous genitalia.
 (3) Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome 
(MAIS) with male external genitalia. Spermato-
genesis and/or pubertal virilization may be 
impaired.
  Steroid SRD5A2 deﬁciency determines a 
decrease in the conversion of testosterone to 
DHT. Individuals with mutations of the SRD5A2 
gene are genetically males. 
  Affected individuals have normal internal geni-
talia (whose development from the wolfﬁan 
duct is androgen-dependent) but nonmasculin-

ized external genitalia (whose development is 
DHT-dependent). 

• Sperm maturation pathway. After leaving 
the seminiferous tubule, immature sperm 
follow this sequential pathway:
  (1) Tubuli recti (straight tubules): Narrow 
tubular structures lined by a simple cuboidal 
epithelium with microvilli and a single cilium. 
Tight junctions occupy an apical position, in 
contrast to the basally located inter–Sertoli 
cell tight junctions.
  (2) Rete testis: A network of anastomosing 
channels lined by simple cuboidal epithe-
lium. The wall consists of myoid cells and 
ﬁbroblasts.  
  (3) Ductuli efferentes (efferent ductules): 
They connect the rete testis to the initial 
region of the epididymal duct. The epithelial 
lining consists of principal cells with micro-
villi (instead of stereocilia) and ciliated cells, 
involved in the transport of nonmotile sperm 
toward the epididymis.  Clusters of these two 
cell types, differing in height, give the epithe-
lium a characteristic scalloped outline.
  (4) Epididymis: A highly coiled duct (about 
6 meters long) with three typical anatomic 
regions: Head or caput, body or corpus, 
and tail or cauda. The lining epithelium is 
pseudostratiﬁed columnar with stereocilia/
stereovilli. The wall contains smooth muscle 
cells. The two major epithelial cell types are 

662

    21. SPERM TRANSPORT AND MATURATION

Essential concepts

the columnar principal cells with apical stereo-
cilia/stereovilli, and basal cells, associated with 
the basal lamina. Intraepithelial lymphocytes 
are frequently seen. The height of the prin-
cipal cells decreases towards the tail region. 
Consequently, the lumen becomes progres-
sively wider. The thickness of the muscle wall 
increases toward the epididymal tail region.  
  (5) Vas deferens (ductus deferens): A 
muscular tube with a length of 45 cm. It 
can be seen in the spermatic cord. The vas 
deferens is lined by pseudostratiﬁed columnar 
epithelium with stereocilia/stereovilli. The 
smooth muscle cell layer consists of a middle 
circular layer surrounded by inner and outer 
longitudinal layers.  
  Additional components of the spermatic cord 
include the cremaster muscle, arteries (sper-
matic, cremasteric, and vas deferens arteries), 
veins of the pampiniform plexus (important 
for spermatic artery—pampiniform plexus heat 
transfer to maintain testicular temperature 2oC 
to 3oC below body temperature for normal 
spermatogenesis), and nerves. 
  The vas deferens ends in a dilated ampulla 
receiving the duct of the seminal vesicle to 
form the ejaculatory duct passing through the 
prostate gland.

• Accessory genital glands. The accessory 
glands of the male reproductive system are 
the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and 
the bulbourethral glands of Cowper.
  Each seminal vesicle has three components: 
  (1) An external connective tissue capsule. 
  (2) A middle smooth muscle layer.
  (3) An internal highly folded mucosa lined by 
a simple cuboidal-to-pseudostratiﬁed columnar 
epithelium supported by a lamina propria.
  Under the inﬂuence of androgens, the 
seminal vesicle epithelium contributes 70% to 
85% of an alkaline ﬂuid to the human ejacu-
late. The ﬂuid contains seminal coagulating 
proteins, fructose, and prostaglandins.

  The prostate gland is a branched (com-
pound) tubuloalveolar gland. It consists of 
three zones: 
  (1) Central zone, with periurethral mucosal 
glands.
 (2) Transition zone, with periurethral submu-
cosal glands.

  (3) Peripheral zone, with branched tubuloal-
veolar glands, called main glands. Glands are 
lined by simple or pseudostratiﬁed columnar 
epithelium. The lumen contains corpora amy-
lacea, rich in glycoproteins. 
  The alkaline ﬂuid produced by the prostate 
gland contains acid phosphatase and prostate-
speciﬁc antigen (PSA).   
  A combined enlargement of the periurethral 
mucosal and submucosal glands and sur-
rounding stroma accounts for benign prostate 
hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is determined by 
growth factors with mitogenic action produced 
by both stromal and glandular epithelial cells 
stimulated by DHT. Testosterone is converted 
to DHT by the enzyme SRD5A2, present 
mainly in prostate stromal cells. 
  Periurethral nodular hyperplasia produces: 
  (1) Difﬁculty in urination and urinary obstruc-
tion caused by partial or complete compres-
sion of the prostatic urethra by the nodular 
growth. 
  (2) Retention of urine in the bladder or in-
ability to empty the urinary bladder completely.  
The possibility of infection leads to inﬂamma-
tion of the urinary bladder (cystitis) and urinary 
tract infection (pyelonephritis).
  Blocking agents of SRD5A2 activity and 
antiandrogens are used in the nonsurgical 
treatment of BPH. 
  Cancer of the prostate is the result of the 
malignant transformation of the prostate 
glands of the peripheral zone. Blood levels 
of PSA are elevated in patients with prostate 
cancer.
  Let us review how androgens work in the 
prostate:
  (1) Testosterone and DHT bind to androgen 
receptors (ARs). 
  (2) In its inactive state, AR forms in the 
cytoplasm a complex with heat shock proteins 
(HSPs) when testosterone or DHT are not 
present.
  (3) Upon binding of androgens, transported 
by the bloodstream bound to sex hormone-
binding globulin (SHBG), the AR detaches 
from HSPs, forms dimers that bind to andro-
gen, and the androgen-AR dimer complex 
translocates to the nucleus.
  (4) In the nucleus, AR, regarded as a tran-
scription factor, binds to DNA and to transcrip-
tion factors to induce the expression of auto-

crine and paracrine  growth factors to prostate 
epithelial cells and prostate stromal cells.
  Bulbourethral glands secrete a lubricating 
mucus product into the penile urethra.  

• Male and female urethra. The male urethra 
has a length of 20 c m and consists of three 
segments: 
  (1) The prostatic urethra, whose lumen 
receives ﬂuid transported by the ejaculatory 
ducts and products from the prostatic glands.
  (2) The membranous urethra.
  (3) The penile urethra, which receives a 
lubricating ﬂuid from the bulbourethral glands. 
  The epithelium of the prostatic urethra is 
transitional (urothelium) with regional varia-
tions. Smooth muscle and striated muscle 
sphincters are present in the membranous 
urethra. 
  The female urethra is shorter (4 cm long) 
and is lined by transitional epithelium, also 
with regional variations. The mucosa contains 
mucus-secreting glands. Inner smooth and 
outer striated muscle cell layers are observed.

• Penis. The penis consists of three cylindrical 
structures of erectile tissue: a pair of corpora 
cavernosa and a single corpus spongiosum. 
The three cylindrical structures converge to 
form the shaft of the penis. The tip of the 
corpus spongiosum is the glans penis. The 
erectile tissue contains vascular spaces, called 
sinusoids, supplied by arterial blood and 
drained by venous channels. During erec-
tion, arterial blood ﬁlls the sinusoids, which 
compress the adjacent venous channels 
preventing draining. Nitric oxide, produced by 
branches of the dorsal nerve, spreads across 
gap junctions between smooth muscle cells 
surrounding the sinusoids. Within smooth 
muscle cells, nitric oxide activates guanylyl cy-
clase to produce cyclic guanosine monophos-
phate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP).  cGMP relaxes the smooth muscle by 
sequestering calcium into intracellular storage 
sites, and arterial blood accumulates in the 
distended sinusoids and the penis becomes 
erect. The enzyme phosphodiesterase 
degrades cGMP, thus terminating erection. 
Sildenaﬁl, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is 
used to prevent rapid cGMP degradation in 
cases of erectile dysfunction.

22. Follicle Development and The Menstrual Cycle 

The menstrual cycle represents the reproductive status of a female. It starts with menarche at puberty and 
ends with menopause about 40 years later. There are two coexisting events during the menstrual cycle: the 
ovarian cycle and the uterine cycle.  During the ovarian cycle, several ovarian follicles, each housing a primary 
oocyte, undergo a growing process (folliculogenesis) in preparation for ovulation into the oviducts or fallopian 
tubes. During the concurrent uterine cycle, the endometrium, the lining of the uterus, is preparing for embryo 
implantation. If fertilization of the ovulated egg does not take place, the endometrium is shed, menstruation 
occurs and a new menstrual cycle starts. This chapter is focused on structural and functional aspects of the 
ovarian and uterine cycle, including speciﬁc hormonal disorders and pathologic conditions of the uterine cervix.    

Development of the female reproductive tract
The reproductive tract develops through the differ-
entiation of wolfﬁan ducts (male reproductive tract 
anlage)  and  müllerian  ducts  (female  reproductive 
tract anlage). The female reproductive system con-
sists of the ovaries, the ducts (oviduct, uterus, and 
vagina),  and  the  external  genitalia  (labia  majora, 
labia minora, and clitoris). 

Knowledge of the developmental sequence from 
the indifferent stage to the fully developed stage is 
helpful  in  understanding  the  structural  anomalies 
that  can  be  clinically  observed. The  molecular  as-
pects of the development of the ovary, female genital 
ducts, and external genitalia are summarized in the 
next sections.  
 
Development of the ovary
The differentiation of a testis or an ovary from the 
indifferent gonad is a complex developmental process 
involving various genes and hormones.

Wnt4 is a major player in the ovarian-determina-
tion pathway and sexual differentiation. Wnt4 is a 
member of the Wingless (Wnt) family of proteins 
(see Chapter 3, Cell Signaling). 

The testis-determining factor (TDF), encoded by 
the gene SRY, on the sex-determining region of the 
Y chromosome, and the Sox9 (for sex determining 
region Y-box 9) gene are responsible for the develop-
ment of the indifferent gonads into testes. As previ-
ously indicated, Sox9 participates in the development 
of the skeleton (see Chondrogenesis in Chapter 4, 
Connective Tissue). 

As discussed in Chapter 21, Sperm Transport and 
Maturation,  the  cortical  region  of  the  primitive 
gonad develops into an ovary. The cortical region of 
the indifferent gonad initially contains the primary 
sex cords (ﬁfth week of development). 

One  week  later,  cells  of  the  primary  cell  cords 
degenerate and are replaced by secondary sex cords 
that surround individual oogonia (Figure 22-1). 

grating primordial germinal cells derived from the 
yolk  sac.  Primordial  germinal  cells  contain  two  X 
chromosomes.  

In the fetal ovary, oogonia enter meiotic prophase 
I to become primary oocytes. Primary oocytes are ar-
rested after completion of crossing over (exchange of 
genetic information between nonsister chromatids of 
homologous chromosomes). Meiotic prophase arrest 
continues until puberty, when one or more ovarian 
follicles are recruited to initiate their development.

Development of the female genital ducts
During development, the cranial ends of the mülle-
rian ducts (paramesonephric ducts) remain separated 
to  form  the  oviducts. The  oviducts  open  into  the 
coelomic  cavity  (the  future  peritoneal  cavity). The 
caudal segments of the müllerian ducts (mesonephric 
ducts) fuse to develop into the uterovaginal primor-
dium that becomes the uterus and upper part of the 
vagina. The broad ligaments of the uterus, derived 
from two peritoneal folds, approach each other when 
the müllerian ducts fuse.

The primitive cloaca is divided by the urorectal 

septum into two regions: 

1. The ventral urogenital sinus.
2. The dorsal anorectal canal.  
The urorectal septum fuses with the cloacal mem-
brane (the future site of the perineal body), which 
is divided into the dorsal anal membrane and the 
larger ventral urogenital membrane. By week 7, the 
membranes rupture.

The contact of the uterovaginal primordium with 
the urogenital sinus results in the formation of the 
vaginal plate. The canalization of the vaginal plate 
results in the development of the middle and lower 
portions of the vagina: 

1. The solid mass of cells of the vaginal plate ex-
tends from the urogenital sinus into the uterovaginal 
primordium. 

2. The central cells of the vaginal plate disappear, 

Oogonia result from the mitotic division of mi-

forming the lumen of the vagina.

of the transforming growth factor-(cid:96) family produced by 
Sertoli cells in the testes. AMH regressive actions on the 

epithelial lining of the müllerian duct are indirect; they are 
mediated by binding of AMH to AMH receptor 2 (AMHR2) 
on the surrounding mesenchymal cells. 
   Persistent müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) in 
human males is associated with cryptorchidism 
(undescended testis) or ectopic testis accompanied by 
inguinal hernia. Gene mutations of AMH and AMHR2 
are found in individuals with PDMS (displaying oviducts, 
uterus and cervix in addition to male external genitalia).

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

Development of the reproductive tract

3. The peripheral cells persist and form the vaginal 

epithelium.

The urogenital sinus also gives rise to the urinary 

bladder, urethra, vestibular glands, and hymen.

Development of the external genitalia
By week 4, the genital tubercle, or phallus, develops 
at the cranial end of the  cloacal membrane. Then, 
labioscrotal swellings and urogenital folds develop 
at either side of the cloacal membrane. 

The genital tubercle enlarges in both the female 
and male. In the absence of androgens, the external 
genitalia  are  feminized:  the  phallus  develops  into 
the  clitoris. The  urogenital  folds  form  the  labia 
minora, and the labioscrotal swellings develop into 
the labia majora.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Developmental anomalies of 
the müllerian duct  
Failure of müllerian development occurs in 46,XX 
female  patients  with  müllerian  agenesis  (Mayer–
Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome). Müllerian 
agenesis is characterized by the absence of the uterus, 
cervix, and upper vagina. Kidney abnormalities, in-
cluding a pelvic kidney or the more severe unilateral 
agenesis of the kidney, are observed. 

Inactivation of the Wnt4 gene has been implicated 
in this disorder. Wnt4 is secreted by the müllerian-
duct epithelium. WNT4 suppresses the synthesis of 
gonadal  androgen  in  females  by  antagonizing  the 
nuclear-receptor  steroid  factor  1  (SF-1),  thereby 
inhibiting steroidogenic enzymes.  

Persistent  müllerian  duct  syndrome  (PMDS) 
occurs in 46,XY males as a rare form of male pseu-
dohermaphroditism. It is caused by a defect in either 
the AMH gene or its receptor (AMHR2). Patients 
with this syndrome retain müllerian ducts and have 
unilateral or bilateral undescended testes. See Figure 
22-1 concerning the PMDS in human males.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Turner's syndrome
The central genetic defect recognized in prepubertal 
and  pubertal  girls  with  Turner's  syndrome  is  the 

 Box 22-A   |  Lgr5+ stem cells in the ovarian surface epithelium

•  The ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) has Lgr5+ (for leucine-rich repeat-
containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) stem cells that repair the damage 
caused to the ovarian surface cell lining after each ovulation. Lgr5 is a marker of 
stem cells in many organs, including the crypts of Lieberkühn as we discuss in 
Chapter 16, Lower Digestive Segment.
• In the fetal ovary, cells of the OSE are the progenitor cells of granulosa 
cells and stromal cells that constitute the growing ovarian follicles after birth.  
This function persists in the OSE and hilum of the adult ovary and ﬁmbria of the 
oviduct.
• The observation of Lgr5+ cells on the OSE, ovarian hilum, and ﬁmbria of the 
oviduct has been associated to the development of serous ovarian carcinomas 
that spread to the entire ovary and metastasize extensively. 

absence of all or part of a second X chromosome 
(45, X) and a lack of Barr bodies.

 The  prenatal  diagnosis  of Turner's  syndrome  is 
based on the ﬁnding of fetal edema on ultrasonogra-
phy, abnormal levels of human chorionic gonadotro-
pin, and (cid:95)-fetoprotein during the screening of mater-
nal serum. A 45,X fetus often aborts spontaneously.  
 Physical ﬁndings include congenital lymphedema, 
short stature, and gonadal dysgenesis. The ovaries are 
represented by streaks. Puffy hands and feet or redun-
dant nuchal skin are characteristic clinical ﬁndings. 
Gonadal dysgenesis is a typical feature of Turner's 
syndrome.  Ovarian  failure  is  characterized  by  de-
creased or absent production of estrogens in associa-
tion with elevated levels of gonadotropins, resulting 
in a failure to establish secondary sexual development 
(because of a lack of estrogens).

Patients require hormone-replacement therapy to 
initiate puberty and complete growth. Recombinant 
growth  hormone  administration  is  recommended 
when there is evidence of growth failure. Hormone 
replacement  therapy  (estrogen  and  progesterone) 
compensates for ovarian atrophy.

The ovaries
Each ovary is lined by a simple squamous-to-low cu-
boidal epithelium (called ovarian surface epithelium, 
see Box 22-A) and a subjacent connective tissue layer, 
the tunica albuginea.  

A cortex and a medulla without distinct demarca-
tion can be visualized in a cross section. The broad 
cortex  contains  connective  tissue  and  primordial 
follicles housing primary oocytes (at the end of mei-
otic prophase I). The medulla consists of connective 
tissue, interstitial cells, nerves, lymphatics, and blood 
vessels reaching the ovary through the hilum (Figure 
22-2).

The functions of the ovary are: 
1. The production of the female gamete.
2. The secretion of estrogens and progesterone.  
3. The regulation of postnatal growth of reproduc-

tive organs.

4. The development of secondary sexual charac-

teristics.

The ovarian cycle
The three phases of the ovarian cycle are:

1. The follicular phase (folliculogenesis).
2. The ovulatory phase.
3. The luteal phase.
The  follicular  phase  consists  of  the  sequential 
development of several primordial follicles (Figures 
22-3 and 22-4):

1. Primary (unilayered) follicle.
2. Secondary (multilayered) follicle.
3. Preantral follicle.
4. Antral follicle.

The ovary is covered by the ovarian surface epithelium (simple cuboidal- 
to-squamous epithelium) and consists of an outer cortex and a central medulla. 
The medulla contains connective tissue supporting large blood vessels (a coiled 
and tortuous ovarian artery and vein), lymph vessels, and nerves. The cortex 
displays clusters of primordial follicles. The tunica albuginea, a thin layer of 
connective tissue, is observed at the periphery of the cortex.

5. Preovulatory follicle (Grafﬁan follicle).
The following structural changes occur during the 

development of the ovarian follicles: 

•  Primordial follicles. Several primordial follicles,  
about 25 (cid:43)m in diameter, each  surrounded by simple 
squamous layer of granulosa cells (see Figure 22-3) 
are recruited to initiate the process of folliculogenesis.  
•  Primary  (unilayered)  follicles.  Primordial  fol-
licles become primary follicles when the single layer 
of  squamous  granulosa  cells  changes  into  simple 
cuboidal  layer  of  granulosa  cells.  A  basal  lamina 
separates the granulosa cells from the stroma of the 
ovary. At the same time, the zona pellucida initiates 
its assembly, separating gradually the primary oocyte 
from the granulosa cells.

•  Secondary  (multilayered)  follicles.  Granulosa 
cells proliferate into a stratiﬁed cuboidal epithelium. 
A cellular shell or theca (theca folliculi; Greek theke, 
box) surrounds the follicle. The theca begins to or-
ganize two distinct layers: 

1.  The theca interna, a vascularized cell layer ad-
jacent to the basal lamina supporting the granulosa 
cells of the follicle.

2.  The theca externa, a ﬁbrous cellular layer con-

tinuous with the ovarian stroma. 

•  Preantral  follicles.  Small  intercellular  spaces, 
named  Call-Exner  bodies,  develop  between  the 
granulosa cells. These spaces contain follicular ﬂuid 
(liquor  folliculi).  Follicular  ﬂuid  derives  from  the 
blood vessels of the theca interna, reaching the an-
trum by an osmotic gradient.  

• Antral follicle. The Call-Exner bodies coalesce 
into a single space called antrum (see Figure 22-4). 
At  this  stage,  granulosa  cells,  stimulated  by  FSH, 
actively synthesize and secrete estrogen.

•  Preovulatory  follicle  (Grafﬁan  follicle). The 
antrum reaches its maximum size. The ﬂuid of the 
antrum  segregates  the  granulosa  cells  into  three 
speciﬁc regions: 

1. The cumulus oophorous, a cluster of granulosa 
cells anchoring the primary oocyte to the wall of the 
follicle (see Figure 22-4). The cumulus prevents the 
primary  oocyte-from  ﬂoating  freely  in  the  antrum 
ﬂuid. It is also the nutrient delivery channel to the 
primary oocyte.

2. The mural granulosa cells, lining the wall of the 

follicle (see Figure 22-4). 

3. The corona radiata, the layer of granulosa cells 
ﬁrmly anchored to the zona pellucida by zona–pen-
etrating cellular processes (see Figure 22-4). 

A preovulatory or graaﬁan follicle reaches about 
20 mm in diameter, as compared to the 25 (cid:43)m in 
diameter of a primordial follicle. 

 The theca externa forms a connective tissue cap-
sule-like layer, continuous with the ovarian stroma. 
In contrast, the theca interna is a well-vascularized 
cell layer adjacent to the basal lamina of the follicle. 
It consists of elongated cells with small lipid drop-
lets in the cytoplasm acquiring the characteristics of 
steroid-secreting cells. 

In  summary,  folliculogenesis  occurs  around  a 
centrally located primary oocyte arrested at the end 
of meiotic prophase. 

It involves a progressive increase in the population 
of estrogen-producing granulosa cells, the assembly 
of  a  thick  glycoprotein-containing  zona  pellucida 
coat, and the development of the vascularized steroid-
producing theca interna.

A basal lamina separates theca cells from granulosa 
cells. The zona pellucida separates the primary oocyte 
from the granulosa cells.

Upon the formation of the antrum, granulosa cells 

become segregated into two cell populations: 

1. The clustered granulosa cells, surrounding the 
zona pellucida–encased primary oocyte. The clustered 
granulosa cells secrete a hyaluronic acid–rich product 
that enables the capture of the ovulated ovum in the 
fallopian tube. 

2. The  mural  granulosa  cells,  lining  the  outer 
perimeter of the follicle. The mural cells are in close 
proximity to cells of the theca interna. As discussed 
later, this relationship is largely responsible for the 
production of steroid hormones.

Paracrine  signaling  and  cell-cell  communication 
during folliculogenesis
Two forms of paracrine cell-cell interaction take place 
during folliculogenesis (Figure 22-5):

1.  Granulosa  cell–primary  oocyte  bidirectional 

signaling.

2. Theca interna–granulosa cell synergistic com-

munication.

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

Follicle development (folliculogenesis)

Granulosa cell–primary oocyte bidirectional 
signaling 
Zona pellucida is a glycoprotein coat that separates 
a  corona  radiata  layer  of  granulosa  cells  from  the 
primary oocyte. It consists of three zonula pellucida  
(ZP) glycoproteins: ZP-1, ZP-2, and ZP-3.

 The  zona  pellucida  is  penetrated  by  thin  cyto-
plasmic  processes  originated  in  granulosa  cells  of 
the corona radiata that contact the microvilli of the 
oocyte plasma membrane. This cell-cell communi-
cation  mechanism  coordinates  the  growth  of  the 
primary oocyte as well as its cell cycle progression 
(see Figure 22-5).

Granulosa cell-primary oocyte bidirectional signal-

ing involves:

1. Gap junctions and adherent junctions at the 

granulosa cell-oocyte contact sites.

2. The intercellular transfer of speciﬁc members of 
the transforming growth factor-(cid:96) (TGF-(cid:96)) family.  
Gap  junctions  enable  metabolic  cooperation 
between  oocytes  and  granulosa  cells  mediated  by 
the transfer of nutrients and substrates to the grow-
ing  oocyte.  Gap  junctions  are  also  seen  between 
granulosa cells.

Connexin 37 is present in gap junctions connect-
ing granulosa cells to the primary oocyte.  Connexin 
43 is found in gap junctions interlinking granulosa 
cells. A lack of connexin 37, encoded by the Gja4  
gene,  stops  follicle  development  and  interferes 
with the capacity of the primary oocyte to resume 
meiosis  and  epigenetic  modiﬁcations  essential  for 
fetal development. A lack of connexin 43 disrupts 
folliculogenesis during the preantral phase.

Two oocyte-derived members of the TGF-(cid:96) family 

transferred to granulosa cells are (see Figure 22-5):
1. Growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9).
2. Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15).  
GDF-9  and  BMP-15  function  in  a  cooperative 
manner  to  regulate  the  energy  metabolism  and 
cholesterol biosynthesis of granulosa cells, thus en-
hancing female fertility by supporting the metabolic 
needs of the primary oocyte. GDF-9 is also required 
for the formation by granulosa cells of cell processes 
that penetrate and cross the zona pellucida.

 Box 22-B   |  Polycystic ovary syndrome

•  A breakdown in the bidirectional oocyte-granulosa cell signaling mechanism 
takes place in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by a disrup-
tion in folliculogenesis associated with ovarian hyperandrogenism (excess 
androgen), insulin resistance (resulting in high blood sugar), and infertility.  
•  The ovaries are enlarged and contain numerous cysts that can be detected by 
ultrasound.
•  Infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods, excess hair growth (hirsutism), 
acne, and obesity are the clinical aspects of PCOS. 
•  A combination of endocrine and paracrine abnormalities affecting granulosa 
cell-oocyte communication are regarded as a possible cause of PCOS.   

Granulosa  cell-derived  members  of  the TGF-(cid:96) 
superfamily,  AMH,  inhibin,  and  activin,  are  also 
involved in the regulation of granulosa cell function 
during folliculogenesis. 

AMH appears to control the rate at which follicles 
become available for preovulatory development. As 
you are aware, AMH is secreted in the male fetus 
by Sertoli cells, the male somatic cell equivalent to 
granulosa cells. AMH triggers the regression of the 
müllerian duct. 

FSH stimulates the proliferation and estrogen se-
cretion by granulosa cells.  Activin enhances granulosa 
cell responsiveness to FSH. Inhibin down-regulates 
the release of FSH and promotes luteinizing hormone 
(LH)–stimulated androgen synthesis. As we discuss 
below, an androgen precursor is required for estrogen 
production by granulosa cells. 

As you can see, members of the TGF-(cid:96) superfam-
ily participate not only in the bidirectional signaling 
between granulosa cells and the primary oocyte but 
also in FSH regulation of folliculogenesis. 

What prevents the primary oocyte from complet-

ing meiotic prophase I during folliculogenesis?  

Granulosa  cell-derived  proteins  include  (see 

Figure 22-5):

1. Oocyte maturation inhibitor (OMI). 
2. Stem cell factor.
OMI  prevents  the  resumption  of  meiosis  by 
primary oocytes prior to the surge of FSH and LH 
at ovulation. 

Stem cell factor binds to the oocyte c-kit receptor 
and stimulates oocyte growth and survival. As you re-
member, c-kit receptor and its ligand play signiﬁcant 
roles in the migration of mast cells (see Chapter 4, 
Connective Tissue) and primordial germinal cells to 
the gonadal ridges (see Chapter 21, Sperm Transport 
and Maturation).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a clinical 
condition resulting from disrupted folliculogenesis 
caused  by  a  defective  paracrine  oocyte-granulosa 
cell signaling mechanism. PCOS is associated with 
infrequent  or  prolonged  menstrual  periods,  excess 
hair growth (hirsutism), acne, and obesity.  Blood 
levels of androgens are elevated. Infrequent or absent 
menstruation in adolescents may raise suspicion for 
PCOS (see Box 22-B). 

Then,  how  does  the  primary  oocyte  complete 

meiosis I before ovulation?

Just  before  ovulation,  the  oocyte  activates  itself 
by  inducing  completion  of  meiotic  prophase. The 
cyclin B–Cdc2 complex constitutes the maturation 
promoting factor (MPF) that triggers the breakdown 
of the oocyte nuclear envelope, an event called ger-
minal vesicle breakdown (GVBD).  

MPF action leads to the formation of the second-

ary oocyte and release of the ﬁrst polar body.

polar body, that is retained in

The primary oocyte overcomes meiotic arrest and continues meiosis I 
in response to the LH surge. This process results in GVBD, 
completion of meiotic prophase I, and the assembly of the meiotic 
spindle. As a result, the first polar body is formed and released into 
the perivitelline space. The secondary oocyte retains most of the 

cytoplasm and the first polar body degenerates within hours of 
formation. 
  Meiosis II reaches metaphase and awaits fertilization for 
completion and extrusion of the second polar body. A haploid 
state is reached.

Functional synergism between granulosa cells and theca interna cells 

during early folliculogenesis

         In the primary and secondary follicle, granulosa cells 
1  
have follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors. In the 
graafian follicle, luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors 
appear and coexist with FSH receptors. The acquisition 
of LH receptors is essential for the luteinization of the 
ruptured follicle following ovulation.

2
        Estradiol is the major steroid produced by granulosa 
cells under stimulation by FSH. However, granulosa cells 
depend on the supply of androstenedione by theca 
interna cells, regulated by LH, to produce estradiol (by 
aromatization of the androgen) since granulosa cells lack the 
required enzymes for producing the precursor of estradiol.

Theca interna–granulosa cell synergistic 
communication
A basal lamina separates granulosa cells from theca 
interna cells. Yet, signiﬁcant molecular ﬂow initiated 

 Box 22-C   |  Ovarian hormones 

•  Estradiol (estradiol-17(cid:96)) is the most abundant and most potent ovarian 
estrogen, produced mainly by granulosa and granulosa lutein cells.  Signiﬁcant 
amounts of estriol, a less potent estrogen, is produced from estrone in the liver 
during pregnancy. Most estrone, the least potent of the three estrogens, is pre-
dominant in the postmenopausal woman and is formed in peripheral tissues 
by the conversion of estradiol or androstenedione.
•  Progesterone, a precursor of androgens and estrogens, is synthesized by 
follicular and luteal cells.
•  Weak androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) are 
produced by theca interna cells.
•  Other ovarian hormones are inhibin, activin, and relaxin. Relaxin, produced 
by both the ovary and the placenta, induces relaxation of the pelvic ligaments 
and softens the cervix to facilitate childbirth.

in the theca interna cells ensures the production of 
estrogens by granulosa cells (Figure 22-6).

Cells of the theca interna secrete androstenedione, 
an androgen precursor that is transferred across the 
basal lamina to the granulosa cells for the produc-
tion  of  estradiol  (see  Figure  22-6;  see  Box  22-C). 
The  androgen  is  then  converted  to  estradiol  by 
aromatase.  Granulosa  cells  lack  enzymes  required 
for the direct production of estrogens. As a result, 
granulosa cells cannot produce steroid precursors 
during folliculogenesis.

Follicular atresia or degeneration
Several  primary  follicles  initiate  the  maturation 
process,  but  generally  only  one  follicle  completes 
its  development;  the  remainder  degenerate  by  an 
apoptotic  process called atresia. 

Atresia refers to the failure of a follicle to ovulate. 
Atresia is also observed in the fetal ovary and after 

Follicle development (folliculogenesis)

A woman ovulates about 400 oocytes during her reproductive years. 
During a reproductive cycle, a group of follicles starts the maturation 
process.

    However, only one or two follicles complete folliculogenesis and 
are eventually ovulated. The others undergo, at any time of their 
development, a degenerative process called follicular atresia.

their  development  but  the  proportion  of  follicles 
that  become  atretic  increases  with  follicle  size  (see 
Box 22-D).

Apoptosis is the mechanism of follicular atresia. 
Apoptosis ensures regression of the follicle without 
eliciting an inﬂammatory response. 

Atretic  follicles  display  thick  folded  basement 
membrane material, called glassy membrane (Figure 
22-7).  Folded  zona  pellucida  and  apoptotic  frag-

ensures that only viable follicles, containing oocytes 
of  optimal  quality  for  fertilization,  are  available 
throughout the reproductive period. Furthermore, a 

 Box 22-D  |  Folliculogenesis and follicular atresia

•  The development of the ovarian follicle and steroidogenesis are controlled 
by gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH), in part by ovarian steroids and 
autocrine and paracrine secretions of the granulosa cells.
•  About 7 million primary oocytes are present in the fetal ovary by midgestation. 
There is a gradual loss of oocytes and, at birth, approximately 400,000 oocytes 
remain. Only 400 follicles ovulate after puberty. The remaining follicles degenerate 
and are called atretic follicles.
•  The follicular phase begins with the development of 6 to 12 primary follicles. 
This development is FSH-dependent. By the sixth day of the cycle, one follicle 
predominates and the others become atretic. 

large number of atretic follicles  retain steroidogenic 
activity, thereby contributing to the endocrine func-
tion of the ovary that prepares the endometrium for 
implantation. 

From a clinical perspective, follicular atresia cor-
relates with the menopause-like premature ovarian 
failure (POF) and PCOS (see Box 22-B), two patho-
logical conditions leading to infertility. 

Ovulatory phase
At the time of ovulation, the mature follicle protrudes 
from  the  ovarian  surface,  forming  the  stigma  (see 
Figure  22-4).  Proteolytic  activity  within  the  theca 
externa  and  tunica  albuginea,  induced  by  a  surge 
of  LH,  facilitates  the  rupture  of  the  now  mature 
preovulatory graaﬁan follicle.  

The  released  gamete  enters  the  closely  apposed 
uterine tube or oviduct as it completes meiosis I and 
becomes a secondary oocyte that still needs to ﬁnish 
meiosis II to become a haploid cell. A few hours be-
fore ovulation, changes occur in the mural granulosa 
cell layer and the theca interna in preparation for 
luteinization. Lgr5+ cells of the OSE repair the dam-
age of the site following the rupture of the follicle. 

Luteal phase: Luteinization and luteolysis
Following ovulation, the residual mural granulosa cell 
layer folds and becomes part of the corpus luteum, a 
major hormone-secreting gland (Figure 22-8).

Figure 22-8. Development, function, and involution of the corpus luteum

Formation of the corpus luteum (luteinization)

Following ovulation, the follicular membrane  (also called 
granulosa cell mural layer) of the preovulatory follicle 
becomes folded and is transformed into part of the corpus 
luteum. A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) correlates with 
luteinization.
    Luteinization includes the following:
    (1) The lumen, previously occupied by the follicular antrum, 
is filled with fibrin, which is then replaced by connective tissue 
and new blood vessels piercing the basement membrane.
    (2) Granulosa cells enlarge and lipid droplets accumulate in 
the cytoplasm. They become granulosa lutein cells.
    (3) The spaces between the folds of the granulosa cell layer 
are penetrated by theca interna cells, blood vessels, and 
connective tissue. Theca interna cells also enlarge and store 
lipids. They are now theca lutein cells.

       LH stimulates

the synthesis of 
androstenedione

The function of  the corpus luteum is regulated by two 
gonadotropins: FSH and LH.
     Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the 
production of progesterone and estradiol by granulosa 
lutein cells.  
     LH stimulates the production of progesterone and 
androstenedione by theca lutein cells. Androstenedione is  
translocated into granulosa lutein cells for aromatization into 
estradiol.
     During pregnancy, prolactin and placental lactogens 
up-regulate the effects of estradiol produced by granulosa 
lutein cells by enhancing the production of estrogen 
receptors.
     Estradiol stimulates granulosa lutein cells to take up 
cholesterol from blood, which is then stored in lipid droplets 
and transported to mitochondria for progesterone synthesis.

If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum undergoes a

     Luteolysis involves a programmed cell death (apoptosis) 
sequence. It is triggered by endometrial prostaglandin F2a.
The following events take place:
     (1) A reduction in the blood flow within the corpus 
luteum causes a decline in oxygen (hypoxia).
     (2) T cells reach the corpus luteum and produce 
interferon-(cid:97), which, in turn, acts on the endothelium to 
enable the arrival of macrophages.
     (3) Macrophages produce tumor necrosis factor ligand 
and the apoptotic cascade starts.

 When comparing mitochondria

of tubular cristae in the latter is 
considerably higher.

2
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH. These cells can store 
cholesterol taken up from blood and use it for the synthesis of 
progesterone.

In the absence of fertilization, the corpus luteum undergoes involution 
and regression (luteolysis), luteal cells are phagocytized by macrophages 
and the former corpus luteum becomes the corpus albicans, a scar of 
white fibrous tissue containing type I collagen produced by fibroblast. 

Luteinization involves:
1. A breakdown of the basal lamina of the follicle.
2. Invasion of blood vessels into the wall of the 

now empty antrum. 

Blood  ﬂows  into  the  former  antral  space  and 
coagulates, forming a transient corpus hemorrhagi-
cum. The ﬁbrin clot is then penetrated by  newly 
formed blood vessels (angiogenesis), ﬁbroblasts, and 
collagen ﬁbers. Note that angiogenesis is a normal 
physiologic  process  that  takes  place  during  each 
menstrual cycle. 

3. A transformation of mural granulosa cells and 
theca  interna  cells.  Mural  granulosa  cells  change 
into granulosa lutein cells. They display the typical 
features of steroid-secreting cells (lipid droplets, a

Follicular development depends on

in the menstrual cycle, FSH levels increase. 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the 
production by theca interna cells of 
androstenedione, which is transferred to 
granulosa cells for its aromatization into 
estrogen (this event is known as theca 
interna–follicular cell synergism).

Estrogen and FSH 
stimulate the synthesis 
of LH receptor by 
granulosa cells late in 
the follicular phase.  

Progesterone and estrogen 
secretion from the rapidly 
luteinizing follicle increases in 
response to LH stimulation.
LH is luteotropic.   

If pregnancy does not occur, 
luteolysis begins 7 days 
after ovulation. The 
production of progesterone, 
estrogen, and inhibin 
decreases and FSH levels 
increase gradually.  
Menstruation begins.

Contractions help the displacement of sperm toward 
the egg and the fertilized egg toward the uterus.

        The lumen of the ampulla is occupied by folds of the mucosa forming   
2
convoluted channels. The displacement of the ovum through the ampulla is slow. 
This is the site where fertilization occurs.  A fertilized egg may implant in the 
mucosa of the oviduct (ectopic pregnancy). The progression of pregnancy is 
disrupted by the rupture of the oviduct and is accompanied by internal bleeding.

tion. The expression of LH receptors by granulosa 
cells is an essential step in the luteinization process. 
The theca interna cells change into theca lutein 
cells,  which  produce  androstenedione  and  pro-
gesterone  in  response  to  LH  stimulation  (Figure 
22-10). 

Granulosa  lutein  cells  still  lack  the  steroido-

genic enzyme required for the complete synthesis 
of estradiol (see Box 22-C). Yet, they can synthesize 
progesterone.

Theca lutein cells cooperate with granulosa lutein 
cells by providing androstenedione, which is then 
converted  into  estradiol  by  aromatase  within  fol-
licular lutein cells (see Figure 22-10).

Functional layer

The functional layer of the 
endometrium is most affected by: 
1. Changes in the blood levels of 
estrogens and progesterone.
2.  The blood supply from spiral 
arteries.
    This layer is partially or totally lost 
after menstruation.

Basal layer

The basal layer is not affected by 
changes in the blood levels of 
estrogens and progesterone.
    The blood supply derives from 
basal arteries rather than spiral 
arteries.
    This layer is not lost after 
menstruation. The functional layer 
regenerates after menstruation from 
the basal-functional layer boundary.

Progestational period

The corpus luteum continues to enlarge and enters 
an  involution  stage  about  14  days  after  ovulation 
unless fertilization occurs. If fertilization takes place, 
the corpus luteum continues to enlarge and produce 
progesterone and estrogen under the stimulatory ac-
tion of  human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) syn-
thesized by the trophoblast of the implanted embryo. 
 Regression of the corpus luteum, luteolysis, leads 
to the formation of the corpus albicans, resulting 
from  the  stromal  connective  tissue  replacing  the 
mass of degenerating luteal cells of the corpus luteum 
(Figure 22-11). 

The corpus albicans remains in the ovary; it de-

creases in size but seldom disappears.

Hormonal regulation of ovulation and the corpus 
luteum
Let us review the hormonal regulation of the men-
strual cycle. 

Two hormones of the anterior hypophysis, con-
trolled by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
produced by neurons of the arcuate nucleus in the 
hypothalamus,  regulate  follicular  growth  (Figure 
22-12):

1.  Follicle-stimulating  hormone  stimulates  fol-
liculogenesis and ovulation as well as the production 
of estrogen. 

2. Luteinizing hormone stimulates the secretion 

of progesterone by the corpus luteum. 

FSH  and  LH  effects  are  mediated  by  a  cAMP-

dependent mechanism (see Chapter 3, Cell Signaling).
A  surge  of  LH  immediately  precedes  ovulation. 
Continued LH secretion induces the luteinization of 
the residual mural granulosa cell layer after ovulation.
The production of FSH and LH decreases when 
the levels of progesterone and estrogen are high, and 
then the corpus luteum enters involution (luteolysis). 
Keep in mind that activin and inhibin originated 
in  the  ovarian  follicles  regulate  hypothalamic  and 
hypophysis  gonadotropic  responses  by  a  feedback 
mechanism. 

At the initiation of menstruation, estrogen and pro-
gesterone levels are low and increase gradually during 
the preovulatory period. Estrogen reaches maximum 
levels just before the LH peak precedes ovulation.

Coinciding with the FSH and LH secretory pat-
tern,  the  FSH-dependent  synthesis  of  estrogen  by 
granulosa  cells  stimulates  the  proliferation  of  the 
endometrial  glands.  LH-dependent  synthesis  of 
progesterone  by  the  corpus  luteum  initiates  and 
maintains the secretory activity of the endometrial 
glands.

Oviduct, fallopian or uterine tube
The  oviduct  is  the  site  of  fertilization  and  early 
cleavage of the zygote (fertilized ovum). Each tube is 
divided into four anatomic regions (Figure 22-13): 

1. The proximal ﬁmbriated infundibulum.
2. A long and thin-walled ampulla.
3. A short and thick-walled isthmus.

The infundibulum consists of numerous ﬁnger-
like projections of mucosal tissue called ﬁmbriae. 
The ampulla and the isthmus are lined by mucosal 
folds  projecting  into  the  lumen  of  the  tube. The 
isthmus has fewer mucosal folds than the ampulla.
The wall of the oviduct consists of three layers: 
1. A mucosa layer supported by a lamina propria, 
consisting of loose connective tissue and a few scat-
tered smooth muscle cells.

2. A smooth muscle layer.
3. A serosa layer.
The mucosa lining consists of a simple columnar 
epithelium  with  two  cell  populations  (see  Figure 
22-13) under hormonal control:

Figure 22-17. Decidual cells

The decidual reaction 
consists in the hypertrophy 
of endometrial stromal cells.     
Implantation of the fertilized 
egg depends on a 
hormonally primed 
endometrium (see Chapter 
23, Fertilization, 
Placentation, and Lactation) 
consisting of secretory 
endometrial glands 
surrounded by decidual 
cells. In addition, high 
progesterone levels keep the 
myometrium relatively 
quiescent.

Decidual cell

1. Ciliated cells, which enlarge and produce cilia 
(ciliogenesis) as folliculogenesis and estrogen produc-
tion is in progress. Estrogens increase the rate of the 
ciliary beat. During luteolysis, ciliated cells lose their 
cilia (deciliation).

2.  Nonciliated  secretory  cells  (called  peg  cells), 
whose secretory activity is also stimulated by estro-
gens. Nonciliated cells in some species have apical 
microvilli.

The peristaltic contraction of the muscular wall, 
with an inner circular-spiral layer and an outer lon-
gitudinal layer, as well as the ciliary activity of the 
lining epithelial cells, propel the oocyte or fertilized 
egg/embryo toward the uterus. 

The surface of the oviduct is covered by the perito-
neal mesothelium. Large blood vessels are observed 
under the serosa.

Uterus
The uterus consists of two anatomic segments:

1. The corpus or body.
2. The cervix.  
The    wall  of  the  body  of  the  uterus  consists  of 

three layers:  

1. The endometrium (Figures 22-14 and 22-15).
2. The myometrium.
3. The adventitia or serosa. 
The major component of the wall is the myome-

trium, lined by a mucosa, the endometrium.

The myometrium has three poorly deﬁned smooth 
muscle layers. The central layer is thick with circularly 
arranged muscle ﬁbers and abundant blood vessels, 
which  give  the  name  stratum  vasculare  to  this 
particular layer. The outer and inner layers contain 
longitudinally or obliquely arranged muscle ﬁbers.

Decidual cells derive from the epithelial-like transformation of endometrial stroma cells 
(decidual reaction in preparation for embryo implantation).
     Decidual cells modulate trophoblast cell invasion.
     Decidual cells provide nutrients to the developing embryo.
     Together with trophoblast cells, decidual cells prevent the immunologic rejection 
of genetically different embryonic and fetal tissues.
     Decidual cells have an endocrine role: the production of decidual prolactin, 
related to pituitary prolactin, with a trophic effect on the corpus luteum.

During  pregnancy,  myometrial  smooth  muscle 
enlarges  (hypertrophy)  and  the  ﬁbers  increase  in 
number (hyperplasia). 

Inhibition  of  myometrial  contraction  during 
pregnancy is controlled by relaxin, a peptide hor-
mone produced in the ovary and placenta. Myome-
trial  contraction  during  parturition  is  under  the 
control  of  oxytocin,  a  peptide  hormone  secreted 
from the neurohypophysis.
   The endometrium consists of a simple columnar 
epithelial  lining,  associated  with  simple  tubular 
endometrial glands, and the lamina propria, called 
the endometrial stroma. 

Functionally,  the  endometrium  consists  of  two 

layers (see Figure 22-14): 

1.  A  superficial  functional  layer,  lost  during 

menstruation.

2.  A basal layer, retained as the source of regenera-

tion of a new functional layer following menstruation.
A  menstrual  cycle  consists  of  four  consecutive 
phases:  menstrual,  proliferative,  secretory,  and 
ischemic phases (see Figure 22-15). 

The menstrual phase (4 to 5 days) is the initial 

phase of the cycle.

The proliferative phase (also called the estrogenic 
or follicular phase) is of about 9 days duration. Dur-
ing  the  proliferative  phase,  the  thickness  of  the 
endometrium  (0.5  to  1  mm)  increases  as  a  result 
of the stimulatory activity of estrogen produced by 
maturing ovarian follicles. Mitotic activity is detected 
in both the lamina propria and the epithelium.  

After day 14, when ovulation occurs, the endome-
trium begins its secretory or progestational phase, 
which lasts approximately 13 days. During this phase, 
the endometrium has a thickness of 5 to 7 mm and 
endometrial glands initiate their secretory activity. 

Decidual cell 

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

The  outline  of  the  tubular  glands  becomes  ir-
regular and coiled, the lining epithelium accumu-
lates glycogen, and secretions rich in glycogen and 
glycoproteins are present in the glandular lumen. 

Blood vessels parallel to the endometrial glands  
increase in length and the lamina propria contains 
excessive ﬂuid (edema). The secretory phase is con-
trolled by both progesterone and estrogen produced 
in the corpus luteum.

At the end of the menstrual cycle, the regression of 
the corpus luteum leads to an endometrial ischemic 
phase (duration of about 1 day). A reduction in the 
normal blood supply, causing intermittent ischemia 
and the consequent hypoxia, determine the necrosis 
of the functional layer of the endometrium, which 
sloughs off during the menstrual phase (Figure 22-16).
If  pregnancy  takes  place,  decidual  cells  in  the 
endometrial  lamina  propria  increase  in  size  and 
store lipids and glycogen in response to increasing 
progesterone levels (Figures 22-17 and 22-18). 

This endometrial change is known as a decidual 
reaction    (Latin deciduus,  falling  off)  because  the 
functional layer of the endometrium will be shed as 
the decidua at parturition.

Vascularization of the endometrium and 
menstruation
Arcuate  arteries  supply  the  endometrium.    An 
arcuate artery has two segments (see Figure 22-14): 
1. A straight segment, supplying the basal layer 

of the endometrium. 

2.  A  coiled  segment,  supplying  the  functional 

layer of the endometrium. 

The coiled segment stretches as the endometrium 
grows in thickness. Before menstruation, contrac-
tion of the artery at the straight-coiled interface 
reduces the blood ﬂow resulting in the destruction 
of the functional layer of the endometrium.

Clinical signiﬁcance: Delayed puberty and 
hypothalamic amenorrhea
The onset of puberty requires a functional hypotha-
lamic–hypophysis–gonadal  axis  represented  by  an 
increase in the pulsatile secretion of GnRH to trigger 
sexual maturation leading to reproductive function.
Two  clinical  conditions,  delayed  puberty  and 
functional  hypothalamic  amenorrhea  (absence 
of menses), illustrate the importance of GnRH in 
reproductive function:

1. Delayed puberty is the delayed or absence of 
testicular development in boys or breast development 
in girls at the pubertal timing of the age of 14 years 
in boys and 13 years in girls.

The designation hypogonadotropic hypogonad-
ism  (HH)  indicates  the  unavailability  of  GnRH 
responsible for a delayed or absent gonadal develop-

ment.  This condition can be permanent or transient.
Permanent  HH  is  characterized  by  low  levels 
of  LH  and  FSH  determined  by  hypothalamic  or 
pituitary congenital disorders.  Transient HH can 
be functional. 

Kallmann's  syndrome  is  permanent  HH  as-
sociated with anosmia (loss of the sense of smell). 
Males with permanent HH are often born with a 
small  penis  (micropenis)  and  undescended  testes 
(cryptorchidism). Puberty is incomplete or delayed. 
Affected females usually do not begin menstruating 
at puberty and breast development is absent.  

Kallmann's types 1 to 4 syndromes are caused by 
a congenital defect in the secretion of GnRH deter-
mined by defects in the KAL1 (Kallmann syndrome 
1  sequence),  PROKR2  (prokineticin  receptor  2), 
and PROK2 (prokinecitin 2) genes responsible for 
the migration of GnRH–secreting hormones to the 
hypothalamus.  

The X chromosome–located KAL1 gene encodes 
the protein anosmin-1, that controls the migration 
of  olfactory  neurons  to  the  olfactory  bulb,  and 
GnRH–producing neurons to the hypothalamus.

 In addition, the FGFR1 (ﬁbroblast growth fac-
tor receptor 1) gene controls the fate speciﬁcation, 
migration, and survival of GnRH-secreting neurons. 
Proteins encoded by KAL1, PROKR2, PROK2, and 
FGFR1 are expressed not only during development 
but also in the adult hypothalamus.

Thus, the secretion of FSH and LH is compro-
mised by the absence of GnRH. Exogenous therapy 
with  pulsatile  GnRH  or  gonadotropin  therapy 
usually restores normal pubertal development and 
fertility.

  2.  Functional  hypothalamic  amenorrhea  can 
be  determined  by  stress  conditions  (weight  loss, 
excessive  exercise,  eating  disorders,  and  psycho-
logic distress) inhibiting the hypothalamic pulsatile 
secretion  of  GnRH.  Elimination  of  stressors  and 
administration  of  exogenous  pulsatile  GnRH  can 
restore functionality of the hypothalamic–pituitary–
gonadal axis.

However, a decrease in the function of the above 
indicated  genes  can  predispose  individuals  to 
abnormal  GnRH  secretion  leading  to  functional 
hypothalamic amenorrhea. 

Clinical signiﬁcance: Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a relatively common and painful 
disorder in which clusters of endometrium become 
implanted outside the uterus (predominantly in the 
oviduct,  ovaries,  and  the  peritoneal  lining  of  the 
pelvis). During the menstrual cycle, the implanted 
endometrial tissue (called endometrioma) continues 
to proliferate, secrete, and bleed in relation to the 
hormonal levels as the endometrium does. Trapped

Cervix

Vaginal epithelium

The cervix consists of two components: (1) the endocervical canal 
and (2) the ectocervix.

The stratified squamous epithelium lining the vagina contains 
glycogen.

   The endocervical canal is lined by a mucus-secreting simple 
columnar epithelium extending into the lamina propria in the form of 
glandular crypts. The ectocervix is lined by a stratified squamous 
epithelium continuous with the vaginal epithelial lining.

   Before puberty, the endocervical epithelium extends over the 
convexity of the ectocervix and becomes exposed to the vaginal 
environment. The area between the "old" and "new" 
squamous-columnar epithelial junction is called the transformation 
zone. About 95% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias originates 
within the transformation zone. 

   The vagina contains natural bacteria, in particular 
Lactobacillus acidophilus, which produces lactic acid by the 
breakdown of glycogen.  Lactic acid creates an acidic coat (pH 
3.0) on the vaginal surface that prevents the proliferation of 
bacteria. The acidic environment does not protect from 
trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the 
flagellated protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.

   Antibiotics can destroy the vaginal flora, and Candida 
albicans, a natural fungal component of the vagina, develops 
on the mucosal surface.

bleeding can give rise to cysts, scar tissue, and peri-
toneal adhesions. 

Chronic pelvic pain occurs during menstruation 
(dysmenorrhea).  Excessive  bleeding  during  the 
menstrual period (menorrhagia) or bleeding between 
periods  (menometrorrhagia)  can  be  seen.  Endo-
metriosis  is  commonly  ﬁrst  diagnosed  in  patients 
seeking treatment for infertility.

The cause of endometriosis remains elusive. Pos-
sible causes include a ﬂow back of endometrial tis-
sue through the oviduct to the implanting site and 
the dissemination of endometrial cells through the 
bloodstream. 

Diagnosis is established by ultrasound and lapa-
roscopy. The treatment includes pain medications, 
hormone therapy (oral contraceptives and gonado-
tropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists 
to  block  the  production  of  ovarian  hormones  by 
creating an induced menopause), and laparoscopy 
to remove implanted endometriomas. Management 
of infertility of women with endometriosis consists 
in gonadotropin-induced superovulation with intra-
uterine insemination as well as in vitro fertilization. 

Cervix
The cervix is the lower extension of the uterus. It 
communicates with the uterine cavity and the vagina 
through the endocervix. 

The endocervix is lined by a folded mucosa con-
sisting of deep crypts arranged in different orienta-
tions mimicking a system of mucus-secreting tubular 
glands. This glandular-like arrangement increases the 
surface area of mucus-producing cells consisting of 
simple columnar cells  (Figure 22-19) whose height 
varies with the time of the menstrual cycle and their 
secretory activity.  Occasionally, some of the crypts 
become occluded and dilated by the accumulated 
mucus secretion. These formations are called cysts 
of Naboth or nabothian cysts. 

The stroma consists predominantly of  collagen 
bundles  (dense  irregular  connective  tissue),  some 
smooth muscle cells and abundant blood vessels. 

The secretory activity of the endocervical epithe-
lium is regulated by estrogens and is maximal at the 
time  of  ovulation. The  secreted  mucus  lubricates 
the vagina during sexual intercourse and acts as a 
bacterial  protective  barrier  blocking  access  to  the 
uterine cavity. 

During  ovulation,  the  mucus  is  less  viscous,  is 
hydrated, and has an alkaline pH, conditions favor-
able for the migration of sperm. The high content 
of  ions  (Na+,  K+,  and  Cl-)  is  responsible  for  the 
crystallization of the mucus into a fernlike pattern 
in the ovulatory phase. This feature of cervical mu-
cus is used clinically to assess the optimal time for 
fertilization to occur. 

After ovulation, the mucus is highly viscous with 
an  acidic  pH,  detrimental  conditions  for  sperm 
penetration and viability.  

Pathology: Cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia and human papillomavirus infection
The external segment of the cervix, the ectocervix, is 
lined by stratiﬁed squamous epithelium. There is an 
abrupt epithelial transition between the endocervix 
and the ectocervix, called the transformation zone. 
At the transformation zone, dysplasia, an abnor-
mal but reversible condition, may occur. Dysplasia 
is characterized by disorganized epithelial cells that 
slough off before reaching full stratiﬁed maturity.

However, dysplasia can progress into carcinoma in 
situ, a condition in which proliferation of epithelial 
cells is very active but within the limits of the basal 
lamina (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or CIN).  
This condition can be reversible or can progress (if 
undetected) into an invasive carcinoma that breaks 
the continuity of the basal lamina and invades the un-
derlying connective tissue. Dysplasia and carcinoma 
in situ can be detected by the routine Papanicolaou 
smear (Pap smear).

Various  strains  of  the  human  papillomavirus 
(HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, have been 
associated with the majority of cervical cancer cases. 
Like the Pap smear, cells collected from the cervix 
can be used to determine by an HPV test whether a 
patient is infected with any of the 13 types of HPV. 
This test can detect high-risk HPV strains (for ex-
ample, HPV-16 and HPV-18) in cell DNA before 
the development of CIN. 

Vagina
The  vagina  is  a  ﬁbromuscular  tube  consisting  of 

three layers:
1.  An  inner  mucosal  layer  (stratiﬁed  squamous 
epithelium with a lamina propria usually inﬁltrated 
by neutrophils and lymphocytes; see Figure 22-19).
2. A middle muscularis layer (circular and longi-

tudinal smooth muscle).

3.  An  outer  adventitial  layer  (dense  connective 

tissue).

The surface of the mucosa is kept moist by mucus 
secreted by uterine and endocervical glands and the 
glands of Bartholin in the vestibule. The wall of the 
vagina lacks glands.

The vaginal epithelium undergoes cyclic changes 
during the menstrual cycle. The differentiation of 
vaginal  epithelium  is  stimulated  by  estrogens.  At 
ovulation, the stratiﬁed epithelium is fully differenti-
ated, and abundant acidophilic squamous cells can 
be seen in the Pap smear. 

After  ovulation,  when  progesterone  predomi-
nates, the number of squamous cells declines and

Dyskaryosis

The cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
(CIN) classification defines cytologic  
and histologic changes that precede 
an invasive squamous carcinoma of 
the cervix. CIN 3 stage can regress or 
progress into an invasive phase 
(breakdown of the basement 
membrane, extension of tumor cells 
into the stroma, and invasion of blood 
and lymphatic vessels).
   The term dyskaryosis (Greek dys, 
difficult; karyon, nucleus; osis, 
condition) designates abnormalities in 
the structure of the nucleus.

more basophilic polygonal cells appear, together with 
neurophils and lymphocytes. The vaginal smear pro-
vides rapid information on estrogen and progesterone 
levels during the menstrual cycle and is also useful for 
monitoring the hormonal status during pregnancy.

Pathology: Diagnostic cytopathology
Diagnostic cytopathology is based on observations 
of normal and abnormal cells, either exfoliated, or 
in  imprints  and  scrapes,  in  correlation  with  tissue 
analysis. 

The  sample  collection  and  staining  procedures 
were introduced in 1941 by George N. Papanicolaou 
(1883–1962), an anatomist, and Herbert E. Traut 
(1894-1963), a gynecologist. The diagnostic poten-
tial of cytohormonal evaluation using vaginal smears 
was reported in 1925 by Papanicolaou. 

The  Pap  smear  is  a  standard  procedure  for  the 
early detection of cervicovaginal malignancies.  Two 
components of the Papanicolaou stain are alcohol-
based cytoplasmic stains: eosin, which stains super-
ﬁcial squamous cells pink or orange, and light green, 
which stains the cytoplasm of less differentiated cells 
close to the basal lamina. The nuclei are stained with 
hematoxylin. 

Estrogens stimulate the differentiation of the su-
perﬁcial layers of the stratiﬁed squamous epithelium 
of the vagina. Once the epithelium has differentiated 
under the inﬂuence of estrogens, progesterone causes 
rapid  desquamation  of  the  topmost  pink-orange 
stained squamous cells and light green-stained po-
lygonal cells of the intermediate layers are seen in the 
smears (Figure 22-20). 

Cervical smears provides evidence of HPV infec-
tion. The presence of koilocytes, squamous cells with 
a large and well-demarcated clear perinuclear zone 
surrounded by a dense peripheral cytoplasmic rim 
are characteristic (see Figure 22-20).

Microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, preceded by 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) stages 1 and 
2 (CIN 1 and CIN 2), is shown in Figure 22-20 (stage 
CIN 3). The carcinoma extends into a endocervical 
gland and deep into the stroma in the form of tongues 
and islands of tumoral cells surrounded by inﬂamma-
tory cells. The Pap smear detects severe dyskaryosis, 
inﬂammatory cells, and keratinized superﬁcial cells, 
features that alert the cytologist to the possibility of 
early tumor invasion.

 

Mons pubis, labia majora, and labia minora
The mons pubis, labia majora, and labia minora are 
modiﬁed skin structures. The mons pubis (mons ven-
eris) is skin lined by keratinized stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium with hair follicles covering subcutaneous 
fat overlying the symphysis pubis. 

The labia majora are extensions of the mons pubis 
at each side of the vaginal introitus. In addition to 
skin with hair follicles and glands (apocrine sweat 
glands and sebaceous glands) covering the fat pad, 
smooth muscle ﬁbers are detected in the subcutane-
ous fat. Hair follicles and fat accumulation are regu-
lated by sex hormones at the onset of sexual maturity 
(by the age of 10 to 13 years old).

The labia minora are skin folds without adipose 
tissue  and  hair  follicles  but  with  abundant  blood 
vessels, elastic ﬁbers, and sebaceous glands opening 
directly onto the surface of the melanin-pigmented 
epidermis.  Pigmentation  of  the  epidermis  of  both 
labia  majora  and  minora  appears  at  the  initiation 
of puberty.
   The hymen is the limit between the internal and 
external genitalia. It consists of a thin ﬁbrous mem-
brane lining the lower vagina, covered on its external 
surface by a keratinized stratiﬁed squamous epithe-
lium and on the internal surface by nonkeratinizing 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium with glycogen (like 
the vaginal epithelium).
   The clitoris, located below the mons pubis, is the 
female equivalent of the penis. Like the penis, it con-
sists of two side-by-side corpora cavernosa (erectile 
vascular tissue) separated by a septum, surrounded by 
a ﬁbrous collagenous sheath. The clitoris is partially 
covered by skin containing rich sensory nerves and 
receptors but lacking hair follicles and glands.

Urethral meatus and glands (paraurethral glands 
and Bartholin's glands)
The urethral meatus communicates with the exterior 
close to the clitoris. Para-urethral glands of Skene 

688

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

External genitalia

are distributed around the meatus and are lined by 
pseudostratiﬁed columnar epithelium. 

Bartholin's vulvovaginal glands are found around 
the lower vagina and consist of acini with mucus-
secreting cells. A duct covered by a transitional epi-
thelium connects these glands to the posterolateral 
side of the vagina.

The female urethra is covered by a folded mucosa 
lined  by  a  pseudostratiﬁed  columnar  epithelium 

changing to transitional epithelium and, near the 
urethral  meatus,  to  a  nonkeratinizing  stratified 
squamous epithelium. Mucus-secreting glands are 
observed in the mucosa (Figure 22-21).The muscular 
wall consists of a single longitudinal layer of smooth 
muscle (involuntary sphincter). A circular striated 
muscle  (voluntary  sphincter)  is  observed  outside 
the smooth muscle layer. A connective tissue rich in 
elastic ﬁbers provides support to the muscle layers. 

Essential concepts

Follicle Development and The Menstrual Cycle

• Development of the ovary. The cortical region 
of the indifferent gonad develops into an 
ovary. 
  Primary sex cords, derived from the 
coelomic epithelium, are replaced by 
secondary sex cords surrounding oogonia. 
Oogonia are mitotically dividing cells derived 
from primordial germ cells with two X 
chromosomes. Oogonia complete mitosis 
and enter meiotic prophase I to become 
primary oocytes. Meiosis is arrested following 
crossing over, a stage that persists until 
puberty. Therefore, at the time of birth, primary 
oocytes at the diplotene stage of Meiosis I are 
surrounded by granulosa cells.

•  Development of the female genital ducts. 
The cranial ends of the müllerian ducts 
remain separated to form the oviduct. The 
caudal segments fuse to develop into the 
uterovaginal primordium, which becomes 
the uterus and upper part of the vagina. The 
canalization of the vaginal plate (the contact 
point of the uterovaginal primordium with the 
urogenital sinus) results in the middle and 
lower parts of the vagina. The genital tubercle 
(phallus) develops at the cranial end of the 
cloacal membrane. The labioscrotal swellings 
(that will give rise to the labia majora) and 
urogenital folds (that will give rise to the labia 
minora) develop at either side of the cloacal 

membrane. In the absence of androgens, the 
phallus develops into the clitoris. 

• Failure of müllerian development occurs 
in 46,XX female patients with müllerian 
agenesis (Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–
Hauser syndrome). Müllerian agenesis 
is characterized by the absence of the 
uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. Kidney 
abnormalities, including a pelvic kidney or the 
more severe unilateral agenesis of the kidney, 
are observed. Inactivation of the Wnt4 gene 
has been implicated in this disorder. 
  Persistent müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) 
occurs in 46,XY males as a rare form of male

pseudohermaphroditism. It is caused by a 
defect in either the AMH gene or its receptor 
(AMHR2).
  Turner's syndrome is determined by 
the absence of all or part of a second X 
chromosome (45, X) and a lack of Barr bodies.
 The prenatal diagnosis of Turner's syndrome 
is based on the ﬁnding of fetal edema on 
ultrasonography, abnormal levels of human 
chorionic gonadotropin, and (cid:95)-fetoprotein 
during the screening of maternal serum. A 
45,X fetus often aborts spontaneously.    
  Physical ﬁndings recognized in prepubertal 
and pubertal girls include congenital 
lymphedema, short stature, and gonadal 
dysgenesis. The atrophic ovaries are 
represented by streaks.  Puffy hands and feet 
or redundant nuchal skin are characteristic 
clinical ﬁndings.

• The ovary is lined by an ovarian surface 
epithelium (OSE; simple squamous-to-low 
cuboidal epithelium) with Lgr5-positive 
(Lgr5+). OSE cells are capable of regenerative 
repair after ovulation. The OSE is supported 
by a layer of connective tissue, the tunica 
albuginea. The ovary has a cortex and a 
medulla. The cortex houses the primordial 
follicles; the medulla is connected to the 
hilum consisting of blood vessels (ovarian 
artery and vein), nerves, and lymphatic 
vessels. Lgr5+ cells are present in the ovarian 
hilum.
  The ovarian cycle comprises three phases:
  (1) Follicular phase, consisting of the 
development of a primordial follicle into a 
preovulatory, antral or graaﬁan follicle.
  (2) Ovulatory phase, characterized by the  
rupture of the graaﬁan follicle, completion 
of meiosis I (resulting in the formation of 
the ﬁrst polar body), and release of the now 
secondary oocyte from the ovary.
  (3) Luteal phase, the transformation of the 
residual mural granulosa cell layer and theca 
interna cells into a vascularized, steroid-
producing corpus luteum.

  The follicular phase (or folliculogenesis) 
results in the following sequence: 
  (1) Primordial follicle: a primary oocyte 
is surrounded by a single layer of ﬂattened 
squamous granulosa cells supported by a 
basal lamina. 
  (2) Primary  (unilayered) follicle: a primary 
oocyte surrounded by a single layer of 
cuboidal granulosa cells. 
  (3) Secondary (multilayered) follicle: the 
primary oocyte becomes gradually separated 
from multilayered proliferating granulosa cells 
by the developing zona pellucida. 
  Cell processes of the granulosa cells 
adjacent to the zona pellucida (the future 
corona radiata) penetrate the thickened 
zona pellucida and establish contact with the 
plasma membrane of the primary oocyte. 
  Reciprocal molecular cooperation occurs 
between the primary oocyte and granulosa 
cells. Gap junctions are present at the contact 
points and between adjacent granulosa cells. 
  (4) Preantral follicle: enlarging intercellular 

spaces separate granulosa cells from each 
other. In addition, spaces containing ﬂuid 
(liquor folliculi; also named Call-Exner bodies) 
appear between the multilayered granulosa 
cells. These spaces will coalesce to form the 
antrum in the mature follicle. 
   Stromal cells surrounding the developing 
follicle differentiate into two layers: 
  The highly vascularized theca interna, 
producing androstenedione that is transferred 
to granulosa cells across the basal lamina so 
they can produce estrogen.
  The theca externa, a connective tissue 
continuous with the ovarian stroma.
  (5) Antral follicle: consists of a primary 
oocyte surrounded by the zona pellucida. A 
single large space containing ﬂuid, the antrum, 
is seen.
  (6) Preovulatory follicle (Grafﬁan follicle): the 
granulosa cells become displaced by the ﬂuid 
in the antrum and segregate the granulosa 
cells into two distinct regions: 
  The cumulus granulosa cell region, 
represented by granulosa cells surrounding 
the zona pellucida-primary oocyte complex.
   The mural granulosa cell region, lining the 
wall of the follicle. The cumulus prevents the 
primary oocyte-zona pellucida-corona radiata 
complex from ﬂoating freely in the antrum 
ﬂuid.
  Follicular atresia is a physiologic apoptotic 
process consisting of a failure of ovarian 
follicles to complete folliculogenesis at any 
point in development.

• Two forms of paracrine signaling take place 
during folliculogenesis:
  (1) Granulosa cell–primary oocyte 
bidirectional signaling.
  (2) Theca interna–granulosa cell synergistic 
communication.
  Zona pellucida, a glycoprotein coat that 
separates a corona radiata from the primary 
oocyte, is penetrated by thin cytoplasmic 
processes of granulosa cells of the corona 
radiata and contact the microvilli of the oocyte. 
  These contact sites:
  (1) Are mediated by gap junctions and 
adherent junctions.
 (2) Enable speciﬁc members of the 
transforming growth factor-(cid:96) (TGF-(cid:96)) family to 
prevents the untimely completion of meiotic 
prophase of the primary oocyte. Gap junctions 
are also seen between granulosa cells.
  Connexin 37 is present in gap junctions 
linking granulosa cells of the corona radiata 
and the primary oocyte.  Connexin 43 is 
found in gap junctions connecting granulosa 
cells.
  A lack of connexin 37, encoded by the 
Gja4  gene, stops follicle development and 
interferes with the capacity of the primary 
oocyte to resume meiosis. A lack of connexin 
43 disrupts folliculogenesis during the 
preantral phase.
  Two oocyte-derived members of the TGF-(cid:96) 
family facilitate the growth and maturation of 
the primary oocyte:
  (1) Growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9).
  (2) Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15).  

  GDF-9 and BMP-15 regulate the energy 
metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis of 
granulosa cells. GDF-9 is also required for the 
formation by granulosa cells of cell processes 
that penetrate and cross the zona pellucida.
  Granulosa cell-derived members of the 
TGF-(cid:96) superfamily, AMH, inhibin, and activin, 
are also involved in the regulation of granulosa 
cell function during folliculogenesis. 

 How does the meiotic prophase stage of 
the primary oocyte remain frozen during 
folliculogenesis and is not completed before 
ovulation? 
  Granulosa cell-derived proteins include:
  (1) Oocyte maturation inhibitor (OMI). 
  (2) Stem cell factor.
  OMI prevents the resumption of meiosis by 
primary oocytes of antral follicles prior to the 
surge of FSH and LH at ovulation. 
  Stem cell factor binds to the oocyte c-kit 
receptor and stimulates oocyte growth and 
survival. 
  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) result 
from disrupted folliculogenesis caused by 
a defect in the paracrine oocyte-granulosa 
cell signaling mechanism. PCOS refers to a 
clinical condition associated with infrequent 
or prolonged menstrual periods, excess hair 
growth (hirsutism), acne, and obesity.  Blood 
levels of androgens are elevated. Infrequent or 
absent menstruation in adolescents may raise 
suspicion for PCOS. 
 
  How does the primary oocyte complete 
meiosis I before ovulation?
  Just before ovulation, the oocyte activates 
itself by inducing completion of meiotic 
prophase. The cyclin B–Cdc2 complex 
constitutes the maturation promoting factor 
(MPF) that induces the breakdown of the 
oocyte nuclear envelope (an event called 
germinal vesicle breakdown, GVBD). MPF 
action results in formation of the secondary 
oocyte and release of the ﬁrst polar body, that 
is retained in the perivitelline space. 
 
• Two hormones of the anterior hypophysis 
regulate follicular growth and the menstrual 
cycle:
  (1) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
stimulates folliculogenesis and ovulation as 
well as the production of estrogen. 
  (2) Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates 
the secretion of progesterone by the corpus 
luteum.
  Remember the following key steps of 
hormonal regulation:
  (1) A surge of LH immediately precedes 
ovulation. 
  (2) Continued LH secretion induces the 
luteinization of the residual mural granulosa 
cell layer after ovulation. 
  (3) The production of FSH and LH decreases 
when the levels of progesterone and estrogen 
are high, and then the corpus luteum enters 
involution (if no pregnancy occurs). 
  (4) Note that the events originated in 
the ovaries are the ones that determine 
hypothalamic and hypophysis responses.

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

Essential concepts

  (5) At the initiation of menstruation, 
estrogen and progesterone levels are low and 
increase gradually during the preovulatory 
period.
  (6) Estrogen reaches maximum levels just 
before the LH peak precedes ovulation.
  (7) The FSH-dependent synthesis of 
estrogen by granulosa cells stimulates the 
proliferation of the endometrial glands. 
  (8) LH-dependent synthesis of progesterone 
by the corpus luteum triggers and maintains 
the secretory activity of the endometrial 
glands. 

• The following endometrial changes take 
place during the menstrual cycle:
  (1) During the early proliferative period, the 
endometrial glands are short, straight, and 
narrow.
  (2) During the midproliferative period, the 
endometrial glands are longer and straight. 
The epithelium is mitotically active.
  (3) During the late proliferative period, the 
mitotic activity is intense and the endometrial 
glands grow rapidly and become tortuous. 
The cells of the stroma surrounding the spiral 
arteries enlarge and become decidual-like.
  (4) During the midsecretory period, glycogen 
accumulates in the basal portion of the 
glandular epithelial cells. The endometrial 
glands have a saw- toothed appearance.
  (5) During the late secretory period, 
glycogen translocates from the basal to the 
apical portion of the glandular epithelial cells 
and secretion accumulates in the lumen. The 
stromal cells surrounding the spiral arteries are 
mitotically active, an indication of a decidual 
change.
  (6) During the ischemic period, the upper 
region of the endometrial stroma contains 
numerous decidual cells. The spiral arteries 
contract and ischemia starts.

• A mechanism prevents primary oocytes from 
completing meiosis I while they remain inside 
the developing follicle. 
  Granulosa cells produce oocyte maturation 
inhibitor, which is transferred from granulosa 
cells to the oocyte through cytoplasmic 
processes crossing the zona pellucida and 
connected to the oocyte by gap junctions.
  Just before ovulation, the oocyte produces 
maturation promoting factor (Cdc2-cyclin 
B complex), which induces completion of 
meiosis I and formation of the ﬁrst polar body.

  The luteal phase occurs soon after ovulation 
and consists of the formation of the corpus 
luteum (a process called luteinization). 
  Luteinization consists of: 
  (1) The breakdown of the basal lamina of 
the follicle.
  (2) The invasion of blood vessels from the 
theca interna.
  (3) The transformation of the remnant mural 
granulosa cells into granulosa lutein cells and 
of the theca interna cells into theca lutein 
cells. 
  The secretion of estrogen and progesterone 
takes place in response to FSH and LH 

stimulation. Theca lutein cells cooperate with 
follicular lutein cells to produce estradiol; 
both cell types can independently synthesize 
progesterone.

  When fertilization occurs, the secondary 
oocyte  completes meiosis II, produces the 
second polar body, and becomes a haploid 
pronucleus that fuses with the haploid sperm 
pronucleus to form a zygote. 
  The trophoblastic cells of the implanted 
embryo produce chorionic gonadotropin, 
which will take over the control of corpus 
luteum estrogen and progesterone secretory 
function. 
  If fertilization does not occur, the corpus 
luteum undergoes degeneration (a process 
called luteolysis) and changes into a 
connective tissue scar called corpus albicans.

• Oviduct (fallopian tube or uterine tube). The 
oviduct is a muscular tube with four anatomic 
regions: 
  (1) Infundibulum has ﬁnger-like folds 
called ﬁmbriae, responsible for capturing the 
ovulated complex from the ovary. 
  (2) Ampulla is the site where fertilization 
takes place. 
  (3) Isthmus is the site where:
  • The muscle layer of the tube thickens. 
  •  Muscle contraction helps the displacement 
of sperm toward the ovulated egg or ovum.
  • Muscle contraction propels the fertilized 
embryo to the uterus.  
  (4) Intramural segment at the oviduct-
uterine junction.  
  The wall of the oviduct consists of three 
layers:
  (1) The mucosa, consisting of a simple 
columnar epithelium with ciliated and 
nonciliated cells supported by a lamina 
propria.
  (2) A smooth muscular cell layer.
  (3) A serosa layer.

• Mons pubis, labia majora, and labia minora 
are modiﬁed skin structures. The mons pubis 
is skin lined by keratinized stratiﬁed squamous 
epithelium. The labia majora have, in addition 
to skin, apocrine sweat glands and sebaceous 
glands. Labia minora are melanin-pigmented 
epidermal skin folds with abundant blood 
vessels, elastic ﬁbers, and sebaceous glands.

• Female urethra. The female urethra 
has a folded mucosa lined by columnar 
pseudostratiﬁed epithelium  changing into 
transitional epithelium with mucosa glands. 
Near the urethral meatus, the epithelium 
changes into a nonkeratinizing stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. 
  The muscle wall consists of an inner smooth 
muscle layer (involuntary sphincter) and 
an outer striated muscle layer (voluntary 
sphincter).

  Note that the presence of Lgr5+ cells in the 
OSE, hilum of the ovary and ﬁmbriae of the 
oviduct indicates a potential for neoplastic 
transformation in these three sites. 

• Uterus. The uterus consists of two anatomic 
segments: the corpus or body, and the cervix. 
  The body of the uterus consists of three 
layers: the endometrium, the myometrium, 
and the serosa/adventitia. 
   The myometrium has three poorly deﬁned 
smooth muscle layers. During pregnancy, 
the myometrial smooth muscle enlarges 
(hypertrophy) and the ﬁbers increase in 
number (hyperplasia). 
  Inhibition of myometrial contraction during 
pregnancy is controlled by relaxin, a peptide 
hormone produced in the ovary and placenta. 
  Myometrial contraction during parturition 
is under the control of oxytocin, a peptide 
hormone secreted from the neurohypophysis. 

  The endometrium consists of a simple 
columnar epithelial cell lining that invaginates 
to form simple tubular endometrial glands 
surrounded by a lamina propria, the 
endometrial stroma. 
  The endometrium has:
  (1) A superﬁcial functional layer, lost during 
menstruation.
  (2) A basal layer, retained during 
menstruation as a reserve for tissue 
regeneration. 
  The superﬁcial functional layer is supplied 
by a spiral endometrial artery; the basal 
layer is supplied by a basal straight artery, an 
independent blood supply. 
  Four consecutive phases characterize the 
menstrual cycle: 
  (1) The menstrual phase (days 1 to 5).  
  (2) The proliferative or estrogenic phase 
(days 5 to 14).
  (3) The secretory or progestational phase 
(days 15 to 27).
  (4) The ischemic phase (days 27 to 28). 
  Contraction of the spiral endometrial artery 
during the ischemic phase reduces blood ﬂow 
and triggers the destruction of the functional 
endometrial layer. 
  Ovulation marks the end of the proliferative 
phase and the beginning of the secretory 
phase. 
  If pregnancy takes place, cells of the 
endometrial stroma change into an epithelial-
like shape and become decidual cells. This 
change is called the decidual reaction. 
  Decidual cells modulate trophoblast-driven 
embryo implantation, provide nutrients to the 
developing embryo, and, together with the 
trophoblast, prevent immunologic rejection 
of genetically different embryonic and fetal 
tissues.

• Endometriosis is a disorder characterized by 
the implantation and growth of endometrial 
tissue (called endometrioma) in the oviduct, 
ovaries, and pelvic peritoneal surface. 
  The ectopic endometrial tissue responds to 
hormonal stimulation, like the endometrium. 
  Pelvic pain during menstruation 
(dysmenorrhea), excessive bleeding during 
menstruation (menorrhagia), or bleeding 
between periods (menometrorrhagia) are 
characteristic clinical ﬁndings. 
  Infertility is associated with endometriosis.

• Cervix. The cervix consists of two 
components: 
  (1) The endocervical canal.
  (2) The ectocervix. 
  The endocervical canal is lined by a 
mucus-secreting simple columnar epithelium 
extending into the lamina propria forming 
glandular crypts. 
  During ovulation, the mucus is less viscous 
and alkaline, two conditions favoring sperm 
penetration. After ovulation, the mucus 
becomes viscous and acidic, two unfavorable 
conditions for sperm penetration. 
  Occlusion of the glandular crypts gives rise 
to cysts, called cysts of Naboth or nabothian 
cysts. 
  The ectocervix is lined by a stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium. The simple columnar-
stratiﬁed squamous epithelial junction is called 
the transformation zone, the site of origin of 
most cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CINs).

• Human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually 
transmitted infection, has been associated 
with the development of CINs. CIN can be 
reversible or can progress (if undetected) into 
a microinvasive cervical carcinoma. 
  About 13 strains of the HPV exist. The high-
risk HPV strains are HPV-16 and HPV-18. 

  The Papanicolaou test (Pap smear) has 
played a signiﬁcant role in the early detection 
of cervical cancer. 
  Cervical smears provides evidence of HPV 
infection by detecting koilocytes, squamous 
cells with a large and well-demarcated clear 
perinuclear zone surrounded by a dense 
peripheral cytoplasmic rim.
  Microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix CIN 
stage 3 (CIN 3) is preceded by CIN stages 1 
and 2 (CIN 1 and CIN 2). 
  In CIN 3, the carcinoma extends deep into 
the stroma in the form of tongues and islands 
of tumoral cells surrounded by inﬂammatory 
cells. 
  At this stage, the Pap smear detects 
severe dyskaryosis, inﬂammatory cells, and 
keratinized superﬁcial cells, features that alert 
the cytologist to the possibility of early tumor 
invasion.

• Vagina. A ﬁbromuscular tube consisting of 
three layers: an inner mucosa layer (stratiﬁed 
squamous epithelium, rich in glycogen, 
supported by a lamina propria), a middle 
smooth muscle layer, and an outer connective 
tissue adventitial layer. The differentiation of 
the vaginal epithelium is hormone-dependent 
and undergoes cyclic changes during the 

menstrual cycle. The breakdown of glycogen 
by Lactobacillus acidophilus into lactic acid 
creates an acidic vaginal coat preventing 
proliferation of bacteria but not sexually 
transmitted pathogens.

• Mons pubis, labia majora, and labia 
minora are modiﬁed skin structures. The 
mons pubis is skin lined by keratinized 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium with hair 
follicles covering subcutaneous fat overlying 
the symphysis pubis. 
  The labia majora have, in addition to skin, 
apocrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands. 
The labia minora are melanin-pigmented 
epidermal skin folds with abundant blood 
vessels, elastic ﬁbers, and sebaceous glands.

• Female urethra. The female urethra has  a 
folded mucosa lined by a pseudostratiﬁed 
columnar epithelium changing into transitional 
epithelium with mucus-secreting glands in 
the mucosa. Near the urethral meatus, the 
epithelium changes into a nonkeratinizing 
stratiﬁed squamous epithelium. 
  The muscular wall consists of an inner 
smooth muscle layer (involuntary sphincter) 
and an outer striated muscle layer (voluntary 
sphincter).

  22. FOLLICLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

Essential concepts

23. Fertilization, Placentation, and Lactation

During fertilization, a haploid sperm and a haploid egg fuse to form a diploid zygote. The resulting zygote 
forms soon after capacitated sperm are guided by chemoattractants to the egg. After crossing a layer of granu-
losa cells and binding to the sperm receptor on the zona pellucida, the ﬁrst sperm completing the journey 
achieves sperm-egg fusion. The embryo travels along the oviduct, ﬁnds its way to the uterus, implants in a 
receptive endometrium, and secures fetal development by constructing a placenta. The mother provides nour-
ishment to the newborn by milk produced in the mammary glands prepared for lactation during pregnancy.

Fertilization
Fertilizing  sperm  must  complete  maturation  and 
capacitation before sperm-egg fusion can take place. 
Sperm  released  from  the  testis  and  entering  the 
epididymal  duct  display  circular  motion.  After  a 
2-week maturation process during epididymal tran-
sit, sperm acquire forward motility, a requirement 
for  fertilization. 

After ejaculation, a number of sperm undergo a 
capacitation process in a storage site in the isthmus 
of the oviduct. Capacitated sperm are then guided by 
a combination of chemotaxis and thermotaxis from 
the storage site to the ovum or egg in the ampulla of 
the oviduct where fertilization takes place.  

Capacitation  is  a  biochemical  event  that  can  be 

induced in vitro to enable in vitro fertilization. Dur-
ing capacitation:

1. Non-covalently bound epididymal and seminal 
glycoproteins  are  diluted  from  the  sperm  plasma 
membrane by ﬂuids of the female reproductive tract .
2. The sperm inﬂux of external bicarbonate ions 
stimulates the activity of a speciﬁc adenylyl cyclase 
(ADCY10) to maximize intracellular cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) levels, contributing to the 
start of capacitation.

3. Sperm membrane permeability to Ca2+ increases. 
An inﬂux of Ca2+, enabled through a ﬂagellar pH-
sensitive CatSper (for Cation Sperm) Ca2+ channel 
(Figure  23-1),  starts  in  the  principal  piece  of  the 
sperm tail, reaching the sperm head in a few seconds.

Sperm preparation for fertilization in the female

mediated by: (1) Ca2+ influx across CaSper 
channels and (2) sperm intracellular alkalinization 
and regulation of sperm intracellular Ca2+ levels 
through Hv1, the voltage-gated proton channel.  

Intracellular Ca2+ is released to start the acrosome 
reaction. The outer acrosome membrane fuses with 
the plasma membrane to initiate the release of 
acrosomal enzymes. Membrane fusion is a 
calcium-dependent process.

After sperm-egg fusion, the 
sperm provides a centriole to 
the zygote. The centriole 
replicates and the first mitotic 
spindle is assembled in the 
zygote. The unfertilized egg 
lacks centrioles.

Box 23-A  |  Tetraspanins

•  Tetraspanins, ﬁrst discovered on the human leukocyte surface, have four 
transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops (small and large), and short 
intracytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails. 
•  The transmembrane domains enable the association of additional tetraspan-
ins to assemble the tetraspanin web in which integrins are included. 
•  The large extracellular loop is involved in protein-protein interaction with later-
ally positioned proteins.
•  The intracellular short tails are linked to intracellular cytoskeletal and signaling 
molecules.

achieve sperm capacitation? 

Increases in Ca2+ concentration induce the exo-
cytotic  acrosome  reaction  in  the  sperm  head  and 
alkalinization triggers sperm hyperactivation (inten-
siﬁcation of the beating of the sperm tail).

What is acrosome reaction?
We  have  seen  in  Chapter  20,  Spermatogenesis, 
that the sperm head consists of  three components: 

1. The condensed elongated nucleus.
2. The acrosome,  bound to the acroplaxome, a 
cytoskeletal  plate  anchoring  the  acrosome  to  the 
nuclear envelope.

  23. FERTILIZATION, PLACENTATION, AND LACTATION

Initial steps during fertilization

 Box 23-B  |  Oocyte activation

•  Oocyte activation is an important step in the process of fertilization.
•  Oocyte activation consists in the exocytosis of cortical granules and the release 
of the oocyte from meiotic arrest.
•  Oocyte activation involves an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ characterized by 
Ca2+ oscillations which start soon after sperm-egg fusion.
•  The agent responsible for Ca2+ oscillations within activating oocytes is a 
sperm–speciﬁc phospholipase C, phospholipase C zeta (PLC(cid:99)). 
•  Abnormalities in the structure, functional ability, and localization of PLC(cid:99)(cid:3)in 
sperm are associated with certain types of human male factor infertility in which 
oocyte activation is deﬁcient.  

3. The plasma membrane.  
The acrosome, in turn, consists of: 
• The outer acrosomal membrane.
• The inner acrosomal membrane.
• A content of hydrolytic enzymes (mainly hyal-
uronidase and acrosin, the latter derived from the 
precursor proacrosin). 

The thin portion of the acrosomal sac, extending 
toward the tail, is the equatorial segment (see Figure 
23-1). The equatorial region of the acrosome does not 
participate in the acrosome reaction. Three sequential 
events take place during fertilization:

1. The acrosome reaction.
2. Sperm binding to a receptor on ZP3, a glyco-

protein of the zona pellucida (ZP).

3. Sperm-egg fusion (Figure 23-2). 
In the proximity of the ovum, and in the presence 
of free Ca2+, the sperm plasma membrane fuses with 
the outer acrosomal membrane, an event known as 
acrosome reaction. 

Small openings created by membrane fusion permit 

 Box 23-C  |  In vitro fertilization

•  Fertilization of human sperm and eggs in vitro consists in the following steps:
• Preovulatory oocytes (about 10 or more) are collected by laparoscopy or 
transvaginally guided by ultrasound imaging, following stimulation of the ovaries 
by gonadotropin-releasing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone administra-
tion. Oocytes are retrieved 34 to 38 hours after injection of human chorionic 
gonadotropin to mimic the luteinizing hormone surge.
• The oocytes are incubated  overnight with motile sperm in a deﬁned culture 
medium to achieve  fertilization in vitro. Embryos can then be transferred to the 
patient.
• Alternatively, in cases of a severe male infertility factor, a sperm can be 
injected into the oocyte by the process of intracytoplasmatic sperm injection 
(ICSI).
• In cases of azoospermia (absence of sperm in the ejaculate), sperm can be 
obtained surgically from the epididymis or the testes and used for ICSI.
• Embryos can be tested in vitro for the presence of a genetic or chromosomal 
abnormality by a procedure known as preimplantation genetics diagnosis. A 
sample can be a blastomere of the embryo, a piece of the trophoderm or even 
the oocyte’s polar body. Unaffected embryos can then be transferred to the 
patient. 
• An excess of embryos can be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for later use. 
Propanediol or dimethylsulphoxide can be used as cryoprotectant for pre-blasto-
cyst embryos, and glycerol is used for blastocysts.

the leakage of  hydrolytic enzymes (see Figures 23-1 
and  23-2).  Hyaluronidase  breaks  down  proteins 
present in the intercellular space of granulosa cells of 
the corona radiata. Proacrosin changes into acrosin 
and enables the fertilizing sperm to cross the zona 
pellucida.    

Male  infertility  may  occur  when  the  acrosome 
reaction fails to occur or takes place before the sperm 
reaches the oocyte, also called egg.

After crossing the zona pellucida, the plasma mem-
brane  of  the  sperm  (the  post-acrosomal  equatorial 
region) and plasma membrane of the egg fuse to en-
able the sperm nucleus to reach the cytoplasm of the 
oocyte. The insertion of the sperm nucleus into the 
cytoplasm of the egg is called impregnation.

How does sperm-egg fusion take place?
Two membrane proteins are regarded essential for 

sperm-egg fusion:

1. Izumo1, a protein of the immunoglobulin su-
perfamily, is inserted in the sperm plasma membrane.   

2. Juno, present in the egg plasma membrane. 
In the presence of CD9,  Izumo1 binds to Juno to 
achieve sperm–egg fusion. Then, the Izumo1-Juno 
complex  is  sequestered  within  a  membrane-bound 
vesicle  and  ejected  into  the  perivitelline  space  (see 
Figure 23-2). 

This event, together with a conformation change 
in the molecular organization of the zona pellucida, 
block the binding and fusion of additional sperm, 
thus preventing polyspermy. 

CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily 
of transmembrane proteins (see Box 23-A).  Other 
proteins, such as ADAMs (a disintegrin and metal-
loprotease), may participate in this reaction. 

We discussed in Chapter 1, Epithelium, how the 
disintegrin  domain  of  ADAMs  participates  in  the 
shedding of the ectoplasmic portion of transmem-
brane proteins.

Sperm-egg fusion causes a local mild depolarization 
of the egg plasma membrane that generates within 
5 to 20 seconds calcium oscillations across the cyto-
plasm of the fertilized egg.  Calcium oscillations result 
in oocyte activation involving two fundamental steps 
in the process of fertilization (see Box 23-B): 

1. The exocytosis of the protease ovastacin from 
cortical  granules.  During  this  event,  a  vesicle  is 
formed  to  dispose  the  Izumo1–Juno  complex  into 
the perivitelline space.  

2. To  trigger  the  secondary  oocyte  to  complete 
meiosis II. The second polar body is released into the 
perivitelline space and the secondary oocyte achieves a 
haploid state. Completion of meiosis II starts the early 
embryogenesis developmental program as a zygote. 
Remember that the sperm contributes the centro-
some  responsible  for  assembling  the  ﬁrst  mitotic 
spindle of the new embryo and that mitochondria 
derive from the fertilized egg.

heparin-bound epidermal growth factor–like factor (HB-EGF) with 
binding affinity to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and EGF receptor 
(EGF-R) on the surface of the trophoectoderm.
    Binding of membrane-anchored or soluble HB-EGF to EGF-R induces 
receptor autophosphorylation. The apical domain of uterine epithelial cells 
contains microprocesses, the pinopodes, interacting with microvilli on the 
apical surface of polar trophoblast cells. 

       Decidual cells become epithelial-like and proliferate and the primary 
2
decidual zone develops. Fibronectin, laminin, entactin, and types I, III, IV, 
and V collagen are components of the primary decidual zone. Bone 
morphogenetic protein-2 and -7, fibroblast growth factor-2, Wnt-4, and 
proteins of the Hedgehog family are expressed.

       Localized vascular permeability is observed at the implantation site.

       A secondary decidual zone replaces the primary

inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), plasminogen activators 
(PAs), and inhibitors regulate the remodeling of the 
decidual zone in the presence of prostaglandin 2.

The normal site of implantation is the endometrium of the 
posterior wall of the uterus, nearer to the fudus than to 

the cervix  

 

Zona pellucida during fertilization

We have discussed in Chapter 22, Follicle Devel-
opment  and The  Menstrual  Cycle,  aspects  of  the 
development of the zona pellucida.

 The plasma membrane of mammalian eggs is sur-
rounded by a 6- to 7-(cid:43)m-thick zona pellucida (plural 
zonae  pellucidae),  a  glycoprotein  coat  produced 
mainly by the primary oocyte during folliculogenesis, 
as early as during the primary follicle stage. 

The zona pellucida has important roles in fertiliza-
tion and implantation of the embryo in the endo-
metrium. In vitro fertilization procedures overcome 

the inability of some sperm of penetrating the zona 
pellucida, a form of infertility (see Box 23-C).

The zona pellucida is composed of three glycopro-

teins (see Figure 23-2): 

1. ZP1, a dimer of 200 kd.
2. ZP2, 120 kd.
3. ZP3, 83 kd. 
ZP2  and  ZP3  interact  to  form  a  long  ﬁlament 

interconnected by ZP1 dimers at regular intervals. 

There are four functional aspects related to ZP3 

to keep in mind: 

1. ZP3 is responsible for sperm binding, mediated

  23. FERTILIZATION, PLACENTATION, AND LACTATION

  Implantation of the blastocyst

 Box 23-D  |  Timetable of implantation: Highlights to remember

•  Fertilization occurs in the oviduct or fallopian tube within 24 to 48 hours after 
ovulation.
•  The development of the fertilized egg, called zygote, to the morula stage, 
occurs as the embryo, surrounded by the zona pellucida, travels through the fal-
lopian tube. The morula contains compact embryonic cells called blastomeres.
•  The morula appears in the uterine cavity about 2 to 3 days after fertilization.
•  The embryo, now a blastocyst, hatches from the zona pellucida 72 hours after 
entering the uterine cavity and implants into the uterine wall.
•  Implantation occurs 6 or 7 days after fertilization. Implantation involves two 
stages: (1) apposition of the blastocyst to the endometrial surface and (2) 
implantation of the blastocyst mediated by penetrating trophoblast cells. 
•  The blastocyst is entirely embedded in the receptive endometrium by day 10 
after fertilization. Uterine receptivity, corresponding to days 20 to 24 of a regular 
28-day menstrual cycle, is deﬁned by the optimal state of endometrial maturation 
for the implantation of the blastocyst. Uterine receptivity consists in a vascular 
and edematous endometrial stroma, secretory endometrial glands, and  apical 
microprocesses, the pinopodes, on the apical domain of the luminal endometrial 
lining cells.
•  Differentiated syncytiotrophoblast cells invade the primary decidua (interstitial 
invasion), as well as local uterine blood vessels (endovascular invasion).
•  The uteroplacental circulation is established when syncytiotrophoblast cells 
erode the wall of the maternal blood vessels (see Box 23-E).

by O-oligosaccharides linked to ZP3 with binding 
afﬁnity to sperm receptors. 

2.  Only  acrosome-reacted  sperm  can  interact 

with ZP3. 

3.    ZP3  is  essential  for  species  speciﬁc  sperm 
binding. It prevents sperm from a different species 
to fertilize the egg. 

4. After the ﬁrst sperm fertilizes the egg, the pro-
tease ovastacin, released from the cortical granules 
of the egg, removes oligosaccharides from ZP3 and 
partially cleaves ZP2. This process, called cortical re-
action, together with the disposal of the Izumo1-Juno 
complex, prevent polyspermy. Polyspermy results in 
nonviable  zygotes.  Ovastacin  is  an  oocyte-speciﬁc 
member  of  the  astacin  family  of  metalloendopro-
teases.

Putting things together, sperm maturation in the 
epididymis, sperm capacitation in the female repro-
ductive tract, and acrosome reaction in the proximity 
of the ovulated secondary oocyte are sequential steps 
leading to fertilization. 

Sperm reach a storage site in the isthmus region 
of  the  oviduct  and  a  fraction  of  them  undergoes 
capacitation.  Sperm  reach  the  oviduct  assisted  by 
sperm motility as well as on a passive drag by waves 
of muscular contractile activity of the vagina, cervix, 
and uterus.

Fertilization  takes  place  in  the  ampulla  of  the 

oviduct. 

Sperm are guided to the egg by:
1. A chemoattractant gradient  present in the ovi-
ductal ﬂuid and originated in the egg and granulosa 
cells anchored to the zona pellucida.

2. A temperature gradient between the storage site 

(34.7oC) and the fertilization site (36.3oC).

3. Contractions of the oviduct wall. 
Two  barriers  that  the  fertilizing  sperm  confront 
during  fertilization  are  the  corona  radiata  and  the 
zona  pellucida.  Enzymes  released  following  the 
acrosome  reaction  enable  the  sperm  to  cross  these 
barriers. The ﬁnal step of fertilization is the fusion 
of  the  plasma  membranes  of  the  sperm  and  the 
secondary oocyte. Two plasma membrane proteins, 
Izumo1  in  sperm  and  Juno  in  the  oocyte,  achieve 
sperm-egg fusion. 

Recall from our discussion in Chapter 20, Sper-
matogenesis, that sperm condensed chromatin lacks 
nucleosomes.  Somatic  histones  have  been  replaced 
by  a  protamine  complex  during  spermiogenesis. 
Therefore, the zygote needs to resolve differences in 
the chromatin state of the egg and sperm pronuclei 
to make sure that: 

1. The ﬁrst mitotic division can take place.
2. The embryo can take full control of gene expres-
sion for embryonic development by a process termed 
zygotic genome activation.

The  calcium  oscillations  across  the  cytoplasm 
of the fertilized egg that we mentioned before, re-
sponsible  for  the  completion  of  meiosis  II,  trigger 
the rapid removal of the protamine complex of the 
sperm pronucleus and DNA is re-wrapped by somatic 
histones donated by the egg.

One ﬁnal point: remember that the embryo un-
dergoes extensive epigenetic reprogramming, which 
involves DNA demethylation (see Chapter 20, Sper-
matogenesis). This change is required for the zygote 
to acquire totipotency. The expression of cell lineage 
speciﬁc transcription factors starts in the blastocyst, 
when the outer trophoblast and the pluripotent inner 
cell mass acquire cellular identity.  

Preimplantation of the fertilized egg or zygote
You have learned in the Embryology course that the 
ﬁrst rounds of cell divisions of the zygote, the fertil-
ized egg,  are designated cleavage. The daughter cells 
are  named  blastomeres. The  embryo  consists  of  a 
compact or ball structure, called morula, once it has 
attained an 8-cell number of blastomeres. 

Two different cell populations appear in the blasto-
cyst: the inner cell mass, that produces the embryo, 
and the trophoblast, which gives rise to the extra-
embryonic tissue to support embryonic development.   
In direct contact with the inner cell mass is the polar 
trophoblast layer. Surrounding the blastocyst cavity 
is the mural trophoblast layer. 

The embryo and the maternal endometrium be-
gin to cooperate to form the placenta as soon as the 
blastocyst implants in the endometrium. Box 23-D 
provides  the  time-course  of  events  preceding  egg 
implantation soon after fertilization.

Implantation of the blastocyst
On day 4 of pregnancy, the blastocyst is within the 
uterine  cavity. The  coordinated  effect  of  ovarian 
estrogens and progesterone has already conditioned 
uterine  receptivity  for  implantation,  including  an 
increase in endometrial vascular permeability at the 
implantation site (see Box 23-D). 

On day 5, the blastocyst hatches from the zona 
pellucida and exposes the polar trophoblast to the 
endometrium. If zona pellucida hatching fails to oc-
cur, the embryo will not implant.

The receptive time of the endometrium for the 
incoming embryo, called the implantation window,  
lasts 4 days (20-23 days of the menstrual cycle). 

 The implantation of the blastocyst involves:
1. An initial unstable adhesion of the blastocyst to 
the endometrial surface, called apposition, followed 
by a more stable adhesion phase.

 2. The decidualization of the endometrial stroma 
(Figure 23-3). Failure of the uterine stroma to under-
go decidualization can lead to spontaneous abortion.
Implantation of the embryo requires the interaction 

of the trophoblast cells and the endometrium:

1. The  apical  surface  of  the  endometrial  epithe-
lial cell is coated with bound and soluble forms of 
heparin-bound epidermal growth factor-like factor
(HB-EGF), a member of the transforming growth 
factor-(cid:95) family.

2. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), on 
the surface of the trophoblast cells, autophosphory-
lates and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (also called 
perlecan) binds strongly to HB-EGF. 

Then, cytoplasmic processes of trophoblast cells 
interact with small processes on the apical surface of 
the endometrial epithelial cells, called pinopodes, and 
penetrate the intercellular spaces between endome-
trial cells. Penetration is facilitated by a decrease in 
the number of desmosomes linking the endometrial 
cells that undergo apoptosis. 

As you recall, the lamina propria of the endome-
trium undergoes a decidual transformation during 
the  secretory  phase  of  the  menstrual  cycle. This 
primary decidual zone is remodeled by the action of 
metalloproteinases into a secondary decidual zone 
that houses the implanting embryo (see Figure 23-3).

 Box 23-E  |  Trophoblast cells: Highlights to remember

•  The blastocyst has two distinct cell populations: (1) trophoblast cells, derived 
from the trophoectoderm and surrounding the blastocyst; and (2) the inner cell 
mass, which gives rise to the embryo.
•  Trophoblast cells (the collective designation of cytotrophoblast cells and syn-
cytiotrophoblast cells) are always the outermost layer of fetal cells covering the 
mesenchyme and fetal capillaries of the chorionic villi.
•  The wall of maternal blood vessels is inﬁltrated and ruptured by trophoblast 
cells. Maternal blood is released into the intervillous space, and the outer layer of 
the chorionic villi (syncytiotrophoblast cells) is immersed in maternal blood like a 
sponge in a container of blood.
•  The uterine spiral arteries are converted to uteroplacental arteries. Tropho-
blast cells replace the endothelium and tunica media of the uteroplacental arter-
ies, which deliver blood, at low pressure, to the intervillous space. Basal straight 
arteries are not involved in these changes.
•  When trophoblast cell replacement of spiral arteries is incomplete, the develop-
ment of uteroplacental arteries is deﬁcient and blood ﬂow is reduced.  
•  Preeclampsia occurs when there is a reduced development of the branches of 
the chorionic villus tree and limited fetal growth.

Differentiation of the trophoblast
Soon after implantation, the trophoblast differentiates 
into two layers:

1. An inner layer of mitotically active mononucle-

ated cytotrophoblast cells.

2.  An    outer  layer  of  multinucleated  syncytio-
trophoblast cells at the embryonic pole, facing the 
endometrium. Syncytiotrophoblast  cells arise from 
the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells.

The  syncytiotrophoblast  produces  proteolytic 
enzymes,  penetrates  the  primary  decidua,  and  the 
entire blastocyst is rapidly surrounded by the endo-
metrium. Invasion of the endometrium at the edge 
of the myometrium is called interstitial invasion.

The blastocyst has a cavity containing ﬂuid and 
the eccentric inner cell mass, which gives rise to the 
embryo and some extraembryonic tissues. The mural 
trophoblast  cells,  proximal  to  the  inner  cell  mass, 
begin to develop the chorionic sac. The chorionic sac 
consists of two components: the trophoblast and the 
underlying extraembryonic mesoderm.

Proteases  released  by  the  syncytiotrophoblast 
erode  the  branches  of  the  spiral  uterine  arteries  to 
form spaces or lacunae of maternal blood within the 
syncytiotrophoblast mass. 

This endometrial eroding event, called endovas-
cular invasion, marks the initiation of the primitive 
uteroplacental circulation. 

Decidualization allows an orderly access of tropho-
blastic cells to the maternal nutrients by modulating 
their invasion of uterine spiral arteries.  

The  syncytiotrophoblast  begins  the  secretion  of  
human  chorionic  gonadotropin  (hCG)  into  the 
maternal lacunae. 

The secretion of estrogens and progesterone by the 
corpus luteum is now under the control of hCG, an 
LH-equivalent.

Immunoprotective decidua during implantation
On  the  maternal  side,  decidual  cells,  close  to  the 
mass of invading syncytiotrophoblast cells, degener-
ate and release glycogen and lipids, thus providing, 
together with products of the endometrial glands and 
maternal blood in the lacunae, the initial nutrients 
for embryonic development. 

The  decidual  reaction  provides  an  immune-
protective environment for the development of the 
embryo. The decidual reaction involves:

1.  The  production  of  immunosuppressive  sub-
stances (mainly prostaglandins) by decidual cells  to 
inhibit the activation of  natural killer cells at the 
implantation site.

2.  Inﬁltrating leukocytes  in the endometrial stroma 
that secrete interleukin-2 to prevent maternal tissue 
rejection of the implanting embryo.

histocompatibility  complex  class  II.  Therefore, 
the syncytiotrophoblast cannot present antigens to 
maternal CD4+ T cells.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary villi  
At the end of the second week, cytotrophoblast cells 
proliferate under the inﬂuence of the extraembryonic 
mesoderm, and extend into the syncytiotrophoblast 
mass, forming the villi.

There  are  three  different  types  of  chorionic  or 

placental villi:

1. Primary villi (Figure 23-4).
2. Secondary villi (see Figure 23-4).
3. Tertiary villi (Figure 23-5).
Primary villi represent the ﬁrst step in the develop-
ment of the chorionic villi of the placenta. A primary 
villus  is  formed  by  a  core  of  cytotrophoblast  cells 
covered by syncytiotrophoblast. 

Early in the third week, the extraembryonic me-
soderm extends into the primary villi, forming the 
secondary villi. 

A secondary villus  consists of a core of extraembry-
onic mesoderm surrounded by a middle cytotropho-
blast layer and an outer layer of syncytiotrophoblast 
layer (see Figure 23-4).

Soon after, cells of the extraembryonic mesoderm 
differentiate into capillary and blood cells and  tertiary 
villi are developed (Figure 23-5).  A tertiary villus is 
formed by a core of extraembryonic mesoderm with 

capillaries, surrounded by a middle cytotrophoblast 
layer and an outer layer of syncytiotrophoblast. The 
difference between the secondary and tertiary villi is the 
presence of capillaries in the latter. The capillaries in 
the tertiary villi interconnect to form arteriocapillary 
networks leading to the embryonic heart.

Histology of the placenta
The placenta and embryonic-fetal membranes (am-
nion,  chorion,  allantois,  and  yolk  sac)  protect  the 
embryo-fetus and provide for nutrition, respiration, 
excretion, and hormone production during develop-
ment. The membranes are formed by the embryo.

 The mature placenta is 3 cm thick, has a diameter 

of 20 cm, and weighs about 500 g. 

The fetal side of the placenta is smooth and as-
sociated with the amniotic membrane (Figure 23-6). 
The maternal side of the placenta is partially subdi-
vided into 10 or more lobes by decidual septa derived 
from the decidua basalis and extending toward the 
chorionic plate. The decidual septa do not fuse with 
the chorionic plate.

Each  lobe contains 10 or more stem villi and its 

branches. 

The  50-  to  60-cm-long  and  12-mm-thick  and 
twisted umbilical cord is attached to the chorionic 
plate and contains two umbilical arteries (transport-
ing  deoxygenated  blood)  and  one  umbilical  vein 
(transporting oxygen-rich blood).

The umbilical vessels (Figure 23-7) are embedded

jelly (see Chapter  4, Connective Tissue). 

Embryonic connective tissue cushions the umbili-

cal cord blood vessels to ensure steady blood ﬂow by 
preventing  twisting  and  compression.  The  cord  is 
lined by amniotic epithelium.

Blood collected from the vein of the severed umbili-
cal cord from a newborn baby (following detachment 
from  the  newborn)  contains  stem  cells,  including 
hematopoietic stem cells, useful for transplantation 
to patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and anemia.

Placenta: Decidua basalis and villus corion  
In summary, the placenta consists of a maternal com-
ponent, the decidua basalis, and a fetal component, 
the villus corion (Figure 23-8). 

The maternal component is represented by the de-
cidua. The decidua (Latin deciduus, falling off; a tissue 
shed at birth) is the endometrium of the gravid uterus.  
There  are  three  regions  of  the  decidua,  named 

according to their relation to the developing fetus:

1. The decidua basalis is the maternal component 
of  the  placenta.  Chorionic  villi  facing  the  decidua 
basalis are highly developed and form the chorion 
frondosum (bushy chorion).

2. The decidua capsularis is the superﬁcial layer 
covering the developing fetus and its chorionic sac. 
3. The decidua parietalis is the rest of the decidua 
lining the cavity of the uterus not occupied by the fetus.
The fetal component is the villus corion,  repre-

Note the close proximity of the fetal capillary to

The blood-placental barrier has a significant role in placental function and fetal 
development. The presence of a brush border-like domain at the apical domain of 
the syncytiotrophoblast, facing maternal blood, points to an absorption function. A 
number of transporters in the syncytiotrophoblast and endothelial cells of fetal 
capillaries provide pathways for exogenous and endogenous substances.

dergo  atrophy,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  the 
chorion laeve (smooth chorion). 

The intervillous space between the maternal and 
fetal components contains circulating maternal blood 
(see Figures 23-6). 

Arterial blood, derived from the open ends of the 
spiral arteries, ﬂows into the intervillous space and 
moves blood into the uterine veins. A plug of cyto-
trophoblast cells and the contraction of the smooth 
muscle wall of the artery control the ﬂow of blood 
(Figure 23-9). 

Placental blood circulation
Placental  blood  circulation  has  two  relevant  char-
acteristics: 

1. The fetal blood circulation is closed (within 

blood vessels).  

2. The maternal blood circulation is open (not 

bound by blood vessels).  

Maternal blood enters the intervillous space under 
reduced pressure, regulated by the cytotrophoblast 
cell plugs, and leaves through the uterine veins after 
exchanges occur with the fetal blood in the terminal 
branched villi.

The umbilical vein has a subendothelial elastic 
lamina; the two  umbilical  arteries  lack  an  elastic 
lamina (see Figure 23-6). 

The umbilical vein carries 80% oxygenated fetal 
blood. Although the partial pressure of oxygen in fetal 
blood is low (20 to 25 mm Hg), the higher cardiac 
output in organ blood ﬂow, higher hemoglobin con-
centration in fetal red blood cells, and higher oxygen 
saturation  provide adequate oxygenation to the fetus.
The umbilical arteries return deoxygenated fetal 

blood to the placenta. 

Recall that fetal circulation involves three circula-

tory shunts:

 1. The ductus venosus, which allows blood from 

the placenta to bypass the liver.

2. The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, which 

allow blood to bypass the developing lungs.    

Structure of the chorionic villus
The  chorionic  villus  is  involved  in  maternal-fetal 
exchanges.  It  originates  from  the  chorionic  plate 
and derives from a stem villus giving rise to villous 
branches (see Figure 23-9). 

When  you  examine  a  histologic  preparation  of 
placenta,  you  are  visualizing  cross  sections  of  villi 
corresponding to the villous branches. You may also 
be able to see a longitudinal section of a stem villus.
Fetal vessels are separated from maternal blood in 
the intervillous space by the placental barrier (Figure 
23-10), which is formed by:

1. The cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast 

cells and supporting basal lamina. 

2. Endothelial cells and basal lamina of the fetal 

blood capillaries. 

Each villus has a core of mesenchymal connective 
tissue and fetal blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries 
and venules). 

The  mesenchymal  core  contains  two  major  cell 

types:

1.  Mesenchymal  cells,  which  differentiate  into 
ﬁbroblasts, involved in the synthesis of various types 
of collagens (types I, III, V, and VI) and extracellular 
matrix components (Figure 23-11).

2. Hofbauer cells, phagocytic cells predominant 

in early pregnancy.

The mesenchymal core is covered by two cell types:
1. Syncytiotrophoblast cells, in contact with the 
maternal blood in the intervillous space. The apical 
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast contains numer-
ous microvilli extending into the intervillous space.
2.  Cytotrophoblast  cells,  subjacent  to  the  syn-
cytiotrophoblast  and  supported  by  a  basal  lamina.
Cytotrophoblast cells are linked to each other and to 
the overlying syncytiotrophoblast by desmosomes.

Deposits of ﬁbrin are frequently seen on the villus 

surface on areas lacking syncytiotrophoblast cells.

After the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetal blood 
vessels become dilated and are in direct contact with 
the subepithelial basal lamina. Cytotrophoblast cells

The placenta cannot synthesize 
estrogens from progesterone. The 
fetal adrenal cortex cannot 
synthesize progesterone. 
Therefore, the placenta produces 
progesterone that is converted by 
the fetal adrenal cortex to 
androgens (mainly 
dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] 
and DHEA sulfate [DHEAS]) and 
cortisol. DHEA and DHEAS are 
used by the placenta to form 
estrogens. 
   This placenta–adrenal cortex 
cooperation is the basis of the 
fetoplacental unit concept.

decrease  in  number  and  syncytiotrophoblast  cells 
predominate. This arrangement facilitates maternal-
fetal exchange activities.

In summary, chorionic villi of an early placenta 
consist of two distinct cytotrophoblast and syncytio-
trophoblast layers (see Figure 23-11). Hofbauer cells 
predominate in the mesenchyme. In a late placenta, 
syncytiotrophoblast cells form distinct clusters, called 
syncytiotrophoblast knots (see Figure 23-6).

Functions of the placenta
The main function of the placenta is the regulation 
of  the  fetal-maternal  exchange  of  molecules,  ions, 
and gases. 

This function is accomplished at specialized areas 
of the syncytiotrophoblast adjacent to fetal capillaries. 
The transfer of molecules across the placental barrier 
can follow intercellular and transcellular pathways. 
Figure 23-12 illustrates the main functional aspects 

of the placenta that are of clinical and physiologic 
relevance.

Exchange of gases 
Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide ex-
change through the placenta is by simple diffusion. 
Nitrous oxide anesthesia (used in the treatment of 
dental disease) should be avoided during pregnancy.

Transfer of maternal immunoglobulins
Maternal  antibodies,  mainly  immunoglobulin  G 
(IgG), are taken up by the syncytiotrophoblast and 
then transported to fetal capillaries for passive im-
munity. 

The larger immunoglobulin M (IgM) molecules 

do not cross the placental barrier.

Rh system of fetal red blood cells) cause hemolytic 
disease  (erythroblastosis  fetalis). The  fetus  is  Rh-
positive (Rh D antigen received from the father), but 
the mother lacks the D antigen (she is Rh-negative). 
Isoimmunization  refers  to  maternal  exposure  and 
sensitization  to  fetal  Rh+  red  blood  cells,  mainly 
during delivery. In a subsequent pregnancy, antibod-
ies to D antigen (IgG) cross the placenta and cause 
hemolysis of  fetal red blood cells (see Chapter 6, 
Blood and Hematopoiesis).

The fetoplacental unit
The placenta can synthesize progesterone but lacks 
17-hydroxylase activity to synthesize estrogens from 
progesterone. The fetal adrenal cortex cannot syn-
thesize progesterone. 

Consequently,  a  fetal-maternal  cooperation, 
known as the fetoplacental unit, enables the transport 
of placental progesterone to the adrenal cortex and 
its conversion to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 
which  can  be  sulfated  to  form  DHEA  sulfate 
(DHEAS) (see Figure 23-12). 

When DHEA and DHEAS are transported to the 
syncytiotrophoblast, the conversion to estrone (E1) 
and estradiol (E2) occurs. DHEA can be hydroxylated 
in the liver and serves as a substrate for the synthesis 
of estriol (E3) by the syncytiotrophoblast. 

The luteal-placental shift
Chorionic gonadotropin, instead of maternal lutein-
izing hormone, maintains the corpus luteum during 
pregnancy. This switch, from the corpus luteum to 
the placenta, is called the luteal-placental shift. 

Placental lactogen (also called chorionic somato-
mammotropin) stimulates fetal growth and condi-
tions  the  mammary  gland  for  lactation.  Placental 
lactogen has a diabetogenic effect: It increases the 
resistance of peripheral tissues and liver to the effects 
of insulin. 

Pregnancy is characterized by maternal hyperglyce-
mia, hyperinsulinemia, and reduced tissue response 
to insulin.

Active transport of ions and glucose
The transport of ions is mediated by an adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP)–dependent mechanism. 

Glucose  enters  the  placenta  by  facilitated  diffu-
sion using a glucose transporter.  Fetal glucose levels 
depend on maternal levels. The fetus does not depend 
on maternal insulin. 

Fetal alcohol syndrome
The excessive ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy is 
the cause of  fetal mental retardation and craniofacial 
abnormalities.  

Alcohol  can  cross  the  placenta  and  fetal  blood-
brain barrier causing direct toxicity. Indirect toxicity 
is mediated by the alcohol metabolite acetaldehyde.

Infectious agents
Rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus, herpes 
simplex,  toxoplasmosis,  syphilis,  and  human  im-
munodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are potential 
infectious agents. Rubella viral infection in the ﬁrst 
trimester  can  cause  spontaneous  abortion  or  the 
congenital rubella syndrome (fetal congenital heart 
disease, mental retardation, deafness, and cataracts).

Clinical signiﬁcance: Ectopic pregnancy
The  implantation  of  the  blastocyst  outside  the 
uterine  cavity  is  called  ectopic  pregnancy.  About 
95% of ectopic gestations occur in the oviduct (tubal 
pregnancy), mainly in the ampullar region. A predis-
posing factor is salpingitis, an inﬂammatory process 
of the oviduct.

A  major  complication  is  profuse  bleeding  and 
rupture of the wall of the oviduct caused by the tro-
phoblastic erosion of blood vessels and tissue layers. 
Abdominal pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding 
in a sexually active woman of reproductive age are 
symptoms of a suspected tubal pregnancy. A rapid 
and precise diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is essential 
to reduce the risk of complications or death. 

Pathology: Placenta previa 
The  abnormal  extension  of  the  placenta  over  or 
close to the internal opening of the cervical canal is 
called placenta previa. A possible cause is abnormal 
vascularization of the placenta. 

There  are  three  types  of  placenta  previa  (Figure 

23-13):  

1. Marginal placenta previa, when the margin of 
the placenta lies close to the internal cervical os (low 
implantation of the placenta).

2. Partial placenta previa, when the edge of the

Molar pregnancy (or hydatidiform mole) results from abnormal 
placental development and belongs to the group of gestational 
trophoblastic diseases. Molar pregnancy can be complete or 
partial. A complete hydatidiform mole consists of abnormal 
syncytiotrophoblast and replacement of the normal villus by an 
edematous villus and the absence of the fetus and fetal membranes. 
The blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is high. The 
complete mole represents about 90% of molar pregnancies. The 
malignant transformation potential of a complete mole into a 

choriocarcinoma is about 50%.
   A partial hydatidiform mole involves abnormal cytotrophoblast and 
is characterized by the focal replacement of normal villi by hydropic 
villi. A chromosomally abnormal fetus, usually with triploidy 69,XXY, is 
observed. 
   The recommended management of molar pregnancy includes 
prompt removal of the intrauterine contents by suction curettage 
followed by gentle sharp curettage and periodic assessment of hCG 
levels in blood.

 Box 23-F  |  Hydramnios

•  The functions of the amniotic ﬂuid during pregnancy is to cushion the fetus 
inside the uterus, provide space for fetal movements, and regulates fetal body 
temperature.
• Initially, the amniotic ﬂuid is produced by dialysis through placental maternal 
and fetal blood vessels. Later, amniotic ﬂuid is essentially fetal urine; it is 
absorbed by fetal swallowing. The maximum amount of amniotic ﬂuid is reached 
by the 36th week of pregnancy and then decreases gradually.
•  Severe hydramnios (excessive amniotic ﬂuid) may indicate a genetic defect, 
a fetal defect in the central nervous system or  blockage of the gastrointestinal 
tube. Clinical signs include abdominal pain, signiﬁcant swelling or bloating and 
breathlessness. Hydramnios can be conﬁrmed by ultrasound. Amniocentesis 
is recommended to determine a possible chromosomal  problem. A mild form 
of hydramnios may be detected during the second trimester of pregnancy and 
return spontaneously to a normal condition. 
• Oligohydramnios is a condition opposite to hydramnios in which there is no 
sufﬁcient amniotic ﬂuid (less than 400 ml). It may indicate a problem with fetal 
development (such as renal agenesis) or the placenta or the consequence of 
high blood pressure of the mother. A decrease in amniotic ﬂuid does not provide 
cushion protection to the fetus and the umbilical cord.

placenta extends across part of the internal ostium.

3. Total placenta previa, when the placenta covers 

the internal cervical ostium.

Spontaneous painless bleeding, caused by partial 
separation of the placenta from the lower portion of 
the uterus and cervix due to mild uterine contractions, 
is commonly observed.

Pathology: Abnormal separation and implantation 
of the placenta 
The normal separation of the placenta from the uterus 
during labor is determined by a cleavage at the decidua 
basalis region. 

After separation, the placenta is ejected by strong 
uterine contractions, which also constrict the spiral 
arteries of the vascular decidual bed to prevent exces-
sive bleeding.

A placenta may be retained in the uterine cavity 
when the process of cleavage or ejection is incomplete. 

Disorders of the placenta

  23. FERTILIZATION, PLACENTATION, AND LACTATION

After  expulsion,  every  placenta  must  be  inspected 
to detect missing lobes, which may remain inside 
the uterus. 

When some placental tissue remains in the uterus, 
uterine contractions are deﬁcient and excessive bleed-
ing is observed. Curettage with a suction apparatus 
may remove the retained tissue.

The following pathologic conditions can be seen 

during pregnancy and labor: 

1.  Uterine  atony  occurs  when  the  contractions 
of the uterine muscles are not strong enough and 
postpartum bleeding occurs. 

Predisposing factors of uterine atony include ab-
normal labor, substantial enlargement of the uterus 
(because of hydramnios; excessive amniotic ﬂuid, see 
Box 23-F), or uterine leiomyomas (benign tumors 
of the myometrium). 

Intravenous infusion of oxytocin stimulates uterine 
contractions and decreases the possibility of uterine 
atony. 

2. Placental abruption is the  premature separation 
of the normally implanted placenta from the inner 
uterine wall. Hemorrhage into the decidua basalis 
leads to premature placental separation and bleeding. 
Separation of the placenta from the uterus impairs  
oxygenation of the fetus. 

Possible causes include trauma, maternal hyper-
tension (preeclampsia or eclampsia), blood clotting 
abnormalities,  and  cocaine  use  by  the  mother.  
Spontaneous painful bleeding and uterine contrac-
tions are typical symptoms.

3. Placenta accreta (Latin accretus, overgrown) is 
an abnormally strong and deep attachment of part 
or the entire placenta to the uterine wall. Abnor-
malities in the uterine wall, usually due to previous 
uterine surgery (such as cesarean section or scar tissue 
following uterine curettage [Asherman syndrome]), 
increase the possibilities of placenta accreta. 

The incidence of placenta accreta has increased in 
parallel to the increasing repeated cesarean delivery 
rate and the incidence of placenta previa overlying 
an uterine scar. 

Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging 
enable diagnosis of placenta accreta before delivery 
to reduce possible maternal hemorrhagic morbidity 
or neonatal morbidity and mortality.

There are three forms of placenta accreta, based on 
how deeply the placenta penetrates the myometrium. 
•  Placenta  accreta:  The  placenta  invades  the 
uterine wall but does not penetrate the myometrium. 
This condition, accounts for 75 percent of all cases.
•  Placenta increta: The invading placenta pen-
etrates through the myometrium. Placenta increta 
is seen in 15 percent of cases.

•  Placenta percreta: The placenta extends into 
the uterine wall and its muscles, pierces the uterine 
serosa,  and  may  attach  to  other  adjacent  organs 

(urinary bladder or rectum). Placenta percreta occurs 
in 10 percent of the cases.

Pathology: Gestational trophoblastic diseases
Gestational trophoblastic diseases are classiﬁed into 
three distinct types:

1. Hydatidiform mole.
2. Invasive mole.
3. Choriocarcinoma.
Hydatidiform mole designates the partial or com-
plete replacement of normal villi by dilated or hydropic 
(edematous) translucent vesicles. A fetus or embryo 
is often found in partial hydatidiform mole but no 
fetus is recognizable in complete hydatidiform mole. 
The  villi  are  avascular  with  no  blood  present  in 
remnant vessels of complete hydatidiform mole. In 
contrast, capillaries containing blood can be seen in 
the villi of partial hydatidiform mole. 

Complete  hydatidiform  moles  are  of  paternal 
origin and result from the fertilization of a blighted 
(empty) ovum by a haploid sperm that reduplicates 
within the egg  (Figure 23-14). The frequent karyotype 
of a complete hydatidiform mole is 46,XX or 46,YY, 
and no fetus is observed.

 The fetus of a partial hydatidiform mole is usu-
ally 69,XXY (triploid): one haploid set of maternal 
chromosomes (23,X) and two haploid sets of paternal 
chromosomes (46,XY; arising from meiotic nondis-
junction or from two haploid fertilizing sperm).

Extremely high levels of hCG are characteristic in 
patients with hydatidiform mole. Failure of high levels 
of hCG to regress after initial removal of intrauterine 
contents suggests a need for further treatment.

Invasive  mole  is  the  most  frequent  form  of  tro-
phoblastic disease generally diagnosed by persistent 
high blood levels of  hCG. It invades the uterine wall 
and cannot be detected on evacuated specimens. This 
condition responds to chemotherapy.  

Choriocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm observed 
in  about  50%  of  patients  with  molar  pregnancies.  
Choriocarcinoma is a hemorrhagic tumor in primary 
and metastatic sites. Treatment with combined che-
motherapy agents is usually curative.

Lactation
The mammary glands
The breasts, or mammary glands, develop as a down-
growth of the epidermis. The nipple is surrounded by 
the areola, a modiﬁed skin with abundant sebaceous 
glands. The  nipple  contains  connective  tissue  and 
smooth muscle cells, forming a circular sphincter.

About 15 to 20  lactiferous ducts open at the tip 
of the nipple through individual lactiferous sinuses. 
In the lactating mammary gland, each lactiferous 
duct  drains  one  lobe.  Like  most  branched  (com-
pound) glands, the mammary glands contain a duct 
system, lobes, and lobules (Figure 23-15).

that extends into the ﬁbroadipose tissue of the breast. 
A lobe consists of a group of lobules drained by a

the resting mammary gland. 

Each lactiferous duct is lined by a simple columnar 
or cuboidal epithelium and a discontinuous outer 
layer of myoepithelial cells. Each duct is surrounded 
by loose connective tissue and a capillary network.

In the resting, nonlactating state, the mammary 
glands consist of lactiferous ducts, each ending in a 
group  of  blind,  saccular  evaginations  or  buds  (see 
Figure 23-15). 

During  pregnancy,  the  ducts  branch  and  end 
in  clusters  of    saccules  (alveoli  or  acini),  forming 
a lobule. Each lobule consists of various secretory 
tubuloacinar units. 

 

Morphogenesis of the mammary glands
Placental lactogen, progesterone, growth hormone 
and  estrogen  stimulate  the  development  of    the 
mammary  gland  through  a  number  of  paracrine 
mechanisms. 

Paracrine  mechanisms  include  parathyroid  hor-
mone-related  protein,  amphiregulin,  receptor    of 
activated nuclear factor (cid:103)(cid:96) ligand (RANKL), ﬁbro-
blast growth factor-10, bone morphogenic protein-4, 
Wnt ligands, the hedgehog signaling pathway and 
transforming growth factor-(cid:96). 

Amphiregulin is an epidermal growth factor-like 
protein  that  binds  to  the  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptor on stromal cells. 

Modulated by estrogen, amphiregulin, synthesized 
by  mammary  epithelial  cells,  binds  to  epidermal 
growth factor receptor on the surrounding stromal 
cells, which secrete regulatory factors of mammary 
development during puberty. 

Amphiregulin  absence  leads  to  a  failure  of  the 
elongation  of  lactiferous  ducts  and  a  lack  of  duct 
and alveolar epithelial cell proliferation in response 
to estrogen. 

Unlike  amphiregulin,  RANKL  is  required  for 
postpubertal  ductal  side  branching  and  alveolar 
development rather than pubertal mammary gland 
development.  

In addition, the extracellular matrix and remodel-
ing  matrix  metalloproteinases  and  their  inhibitors 
participate in mammary gland branching by control-
ling the surrounding stroma. 

The basic concepts to grasp are:
1.  Ovarian  hormones,  estrogen,  and  progester-
one, and pituitary hormones, prolactin, and growth 
hormone, drive mammary gland development and

Elevated levels of ovarian estrogen stimulate the branching of the 
rudimentary ducts into an epithelial tree with terminal end buds. 
Each terminal end bud consists of a basal lamina supporting a 
layer of myoepithelial cells and covered by a single epithelial 
ductal cell layer and multilayered body cells at the tip or body. 
Terminal end buds develop under the influence of progesterone. 
Old buds regress and disappear.

Lobular alveolar tissue develops from lateral and terminal buds at 
the ends of the branching lactiferous ducts under stimulation of 
placental lactogen and estrogen, and maternal prolactin and 
progesterone. A connective tissue stroma, with mast cells and 
plasma cells, surrounds the branching ducts and alveoli. 
   Lactogenesis is the developmental process by which the 
mammary gland can produce and maintain the secretion of milk.

Remodeling during mammary gland development  
The development of the mammary glands comprise 
two phases (Figure 23-16): 

1. The formation of the nipple.
2. The remodeling of the mammary gland.
The nipple is visible by week 6 as an accumulation 
of  ectodermic  epithelial  cells  along  the  mammary 
line  placode,  forming  a  depression,  the  inverted 
nipple. After birth, the nipple region protrudes and 
the areola becomes elevated as areolar sebaceous and 
sweat glands develop around the nipple.

Mammary  gland  development  starts  when  an 
ectodermic epithelial cell bud, the mammary bud, 
penetrates the underlying mesoderm adjacent to the 
fat pad  precursor and capillaries.  

During the ﬁrst trimester, each of 10 to 20 solid 
epithelial mammary cords gives rise to a mammary 

sprout (see Figure 23-16). During the second trimes-
ter, the mammary cords become hollow and terminal 
end buds develop by the end of the third trimester. 
The mammary ducts become lactiferous ducts and 
the terminal end buds will change into alveolar buds 
at puberty.

Estrogen, progesterone and prolactin receptors are 
expressed by a population of luminal duct cells (called 
sensor cells). Under the inﬂuence of these hormones, 
sensor cells secrete paracrine and autocrine signaling 
molecules to trigger the proliferation of the adjacent 
luminal glandular epithelial and myoepithelial cells.
The mesoderm differentiates into a connective and 
adipose stroma as well as into the smooth muscle of 
the nipple. 

Bipotent stem cells give rise to luminal glandular 
epithelial cells of ducts and alveoli and to myoepi-

The lactiferous duct is lined by a two-cell-layered

myoepithelial cells, and a basal lamina.

phase (due to glycogen deposits).

Nucleus of a myoepithelial cell. 

Myoepithelial cells are 10 to 20 times 

more sensitive to oxytocin than 
myometrial smooth muscle cells 

After the brief period of colostrum 

secretion, transitional milk, with a lower 

concentration of IgA and protein, is 

replaced by mature milk (a complex of 
protein, milk fat, lactose, and water) 

thelial cells, which migrate to the basal region of the 
lining epithelium. Bipotent stem cells are long-lived. 
They still persist in the adult mammary gland where 
they participate in homeostasis and morphogenesis 
(see below). 

The epithelium of the lactiferous duct of the mam-
mary glands of newborns of both sexes can respond 
to maternal hormones and may produce a secretion 
containing (cid:95)-lactalbumin, fat, and leukocytes. This 
secretion  is  called  “witch’s  milk.”  In  most  cases, 
the simple embryonic-fetal mammary duct system 

remains unchanged in the infant until the onset of 
puberty.  

In the male fetus, the developing duct system un-
dergoes involution in the presence of testosterone. 
The role of the mesoderm and testosterone receptors 
is well demonstrated in the androgen insensitivity 
syndrome  (testicular  feminization  syndrome;  see 
later).

The mammary epithelium is composed of two 
cell lineages: (1) an inner layer of luminal 
glandular epithelial cells organized as a series 
of branched ducts and alveoli, and (2) an 
outer layer of basal myoepithelial cells in 
contact with the basal lamina. The contractile 
myoepithelial cells have epithelial cell and 
smooth muscle cell features and function to 
eject milk from the lactating mammary gland.
  The basal myoepithelial cell layer contains a 
subpopulation of relatively undifferentiated 
bipotent cells representing mammary stem 
cells forming mammary repopulating units 
(MRUs). MRUs can generate the basal and 
luminal components of ductal-alveolar 
outgrowths in multiple pregnancies. Another 
population of unipotent stem cells regulates 
homeostasis of the mammary gland ducts by 
contributing only to the myoepithelial cell layer.

 Box 23-G  |  Lactation

•  Colostrum: early milk (called fore milk) with a lower fat concentration but 
higher concentration of proteins and minerals. The fat content increases over 
the next several minutes (mature milk or hind milk).
•  Milk: a unique species-speciﬁc ﬂuid with nutritive, immunologic, and growth-
promoting components. 
• Lipids are surrounded by a rim of adiphophilin protein (a member of the 
perilipin family). Adipophilin becomes a stabilizing interface between fat and 
the aqueous components of the milk. The cytosol interface allows controlled 
lipolysis and formation of a micellar aqueous suspension useful for absorption 
in the small intestine. Lipids include cholesterol, triglycerides, short-chain fatty 
acids, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
•  Immunoglobulins: the most abundant immunoglobulin is secretory dimeric 
immunoglobulin A (IgA). It provides passive acquired defense for several weeks 
before the baby can produce its own secretory IgA in the small intestine.
• Protective functions of human milk: Milk contains lactoferrin, lysozyme, oligo-
saccharides, and mucins. These components enable some intestinal bacteria to 
become established while others are inhibited. 

(in the presence of prolactin) stimulates the devel-
opment of the lactiferous ducts and terminal end 
buds as well as the enlargement of the surrounding 
fat tissue. 

This developmental process is highly regulated by 
paracrine pathways between duct and terminal bud 
epithelial cells and cells of the surrounding connective 
tissue (ﬁbroblasts and adipose cells) and cells of the 
immune system.

The terminal end buds drive the extension of the 
mammary gland tissue toward the fat pad. Once the 
terminal end buds reach the edge of the fat pad, they 
stop cell proliferation and differentiate into terminal 
ducts.

The terminal end bud is composed of a body seg-
ment,  consisting  of  a  highly  proliferative  cap  and 
body bipotent cells that differentiate into the luminal

glandular  epithelial  cells  and  outer  myoepithelial 
cells of the duct segment.  The duct segment displays 
an inner layer of glandular epithelial cells overlapping 
the myoepithelial cell layer.

Epithelial cells lining the lactiferous ducts contain 
cytosolic and nuclear estrogen receptors. Progester-
one stimulates the formation of new terminal end 
buds,  replacing  old,  regressing  buds  by  apoptosis, 
which eventually disappear at the end of  the ovar-

ian cycle. These cyclic changes are observed in each 
menstrual cycle.

During  pregnancy  (see  Figure  23-16),  prolactin 
and placental lactogen, in the presence of estrogen, 
progesterone, and growth factors, stimulate the de-
velopment of lactiferous ducts and secretory alveoli 
at the ends of the branched ducts from lateral and 
terminal end buds. 

The induction of the transcription factor Elf-5 by 
prolactin is critical for the differentiation of luminal 
epithelial cells into the milk producing alveolar cells.
During  lactation, the lactiferous duct system and 
the  lobular  alveolar  tissue  are  fully  developed  and 
functional. Myoepithelial cells constrict the alveolar 
cells to pump milk down the ducts to the nipple.

Histology of the mammary glands
Each  mammary  gland  consists  of  the  following 
components:

1. A inner layer of glandular epithelial cells, or-
ganized  as  a  branching  system  of  lactiferous  ducts 
ending, when functional, in secretory alveoli. 

2. Myoepithelial cells, surrounding the epithelial 
lining of the lactiferous ducts and secretory alveoli. A 
continuous basement membrane encloses the outer 
layer of myoepithelial cells and the inner layer of glan-
dular epithelial cells (Figure 23-17). The contractile 
myoepithelial  cells  have  epithelial  cell  and  smooth 
muscle cell features. They function to eject milk from 
the lactating mammary gland. 

The relevant regenerative capacity of the mamma-
ry glands evident on successive rounds of pregnancy 
implies the presence of renewable stem cells. A high 
proportion of myoepithelial cells are regarded mam-
mary stem cells, giving rise to bipotent  mammary 
repopulating  units  (MRUs).  MRUs  produce  the 
basal myoepithelial cells and the luminal glandular 
epithelial cells of the mammary ducts and alveoli (Fig-
ure 23-18). Another population of mammary stem 
cells  of  the  myoepithelial  lineage  is  unipotent  and 
contribute only to the myoepithelial basal cell layer. 
The deﬁnition of bipotent and unipotent stem cells 
is useful for identifying cells-of-origin and potential 
biomarkers in breast cancer.

3. A stroma, where subcutaneous connective tissue  

interacts with white adipose tissue.

Each lactiferous duct opens at the tip of the nipple 

in the form of lactiferous sinuses. 

An  epidermic  keratinizing  stratified  squamous 
epithelium lines the outer surface of the lactiferous 
ducts. Sebaceous glands discharge their product into 
the lactiferous ducts. 

The areola contains melanocytes, sebaceous glands 
and sweat glands. The stroma of the nipple and areola 
contains dense irregular connective tissue, bundles of 
elastic ﬁbers and abundant smooth muscle ﬁbers in a 
circular and radial distribution.

As  previously  indicated,  a  cluster  of  secretory 
alveoli drained by a lactiferous duct forms a lobule. 
Figures 23-17 and 23-18 provide a summary of the 
most relevant histologic and developmental features 
of the inactive and active mammary gland. 

Suckling during lactation 
A neural stimulus at the nipple resulting from suck-
ling determines: 

1. The ejection of milk by the release of oxytocin. 
Oxytocin causes contraction of myoepithelial cells 
surrounding the alveoli. 

2. The  inhibition  of  the  release  of  luteinizing 
hormone–releasing  factor  by  the  hypothalamus, 
resulting in the temporary arrest of ovulation.

Milk contains (see Figure 23-18; see Box 23-G): 
1.  Proteins  (casein,  (cid:95)-lactalbumin,  and  large 
amounts  of  parathyroid  hormone–related  protein 
[PTH-RP]), released by merocrine secretion together 
with lactose. 

2. Lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol), released 
by apocrine secretion. Lipid droplets are surrounded 
by the protein adipophilin, a member of the perilipin 
family.

3.  Sugar  (in  particular  lactose,  produced  in  the 
Golgi apparatus from glucose and uridine diphos-
phogalactose). Lactose osmotically draws water into 
secretory vesicles, a process that accounts for the large 
volume of milk.

In  addition,  plasma  cells  present  in  the  stroma 
surrounding the alveolar tissue secrete polymeric IgA.  
Polymeric IgA is taken up by alveolar cells and trans-
ported to the lumen by a mechanism similar to that 
discussed in Chapter 16, Lower Digestive Segment.
After  nursing,  prolactin  secretion  decreases,  the 
mammary  alveoli  regress,  and  the  lactiferous  duct 
system returns to its normal nonpregnant stage within 
several months. 

Pathology:  Benign  breast  diseases  and  breast 
cancer
Each of the structures of the mammary gland (ducts 
and alveoli) can be the source of a pathologic condi-
tion. We have seen how many paracrine pathways 
and bipotent and unipotent stem cells are involved in 
the development and differentiation of the mammary 
glands. Genes participating in these processes may be 
deregulated during  breast carcinogenesis. 

Fibrocystic  changes  are  the  most  common  of 
all  benign  mammary  gland  conditions  in  20-  to 
40-year-old patients. Hormonal imbalances are as-
sociated with ﬁbrocystic changes. In this condition, 
a proliferation of the connective tissue stroma and 
cystic formation of the ducts are observed. 

Pain (mastalgia) tends to be cyclic as cysts expand 

rapidly.

Fibroadenoma, the second most common form of 
benign breast disease, occurs in young women (20 
to 30 years old).  Fibroadenomas are slow-growing 
masses  of  epithelial  and  connective  tissues  and  are 
painless.

Gynecomastia, the enlargement of the male breast, 
is caused by a shift in the adrenal cortex estrogen-testis 
androgen balance. It may be observed during cirrho-
sis, because the liver is responsible for the breakdown 
of  estrogens.  Gynecomastia  is  a  typical  feature  of 
Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY). 

About  80%  of  breast  cancers  originate  in  the 
epithelial lining of the lactiferous ducts (Figure 23-
19). Epithelial cells lining the lactiferous ducts have 
estrogen receptors and about 50% to 85% of breast 
tumors have estrogen receptors. 

There are two types of  estrogen receptors, (cid:95) and 
(cid:96).  The (cid:95) receptor has a higher binding afﬁnity for 
estrogen than the (cid:96) receptor. The (cid:96)(cid:3)receptor acts as a 
physiologic regulator of the (cid:95) receptor. The expres-
sion of the (cid:95) receptor is higher than the (cid:96) receptor 
in invasive tumors than in normal breast tissue.  This 
ﬁnding suggests that a balance between the receptors 
is important in determining the sensitivity of tissue to 
estrogen and the relative risk of breast tumor develop-
ment. A large number of  estrogen-dependent tumors 
regress after antiestrogen therapy (treatment with the 
antiestrogen tamoxifen). 

The familial inheritance of two autosomal domi-
nant genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, has been determined 
in 20% to 30% of patients with breast cancer. BRCA1 
and BRCA2 encode tumor suppressor proteins in-
teracting with other nuclear proteins (see Chapter 3, 
Cell Signaling, for a discussion on Oncogenes and 
Tumor Suppressors). Wild-type BRCA1 can suppress 
estrogen-dependent transcription pathways related to 
the proliferation of  epithelial cells of the mammary 
gland. A mutation of BRCA1 can determine the loss 
of this ability, facilitating tumorigenesis. Women with 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have a lifetime risk of 
invasive breast and ovarian cancer.  Prophylactic bilat-
eral total mastectomy has been shown to drastically 
reduce the incidence of breast cancer among women 
with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

The  mammary  gland  has  a  rich  blood  and  lym-
phatic system, which facilitates metastases. Axillary 
lymph  node  metastases  are  the  most  important 
prognostic factor.

 Estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal 
women has been implicated as a risk factor for breast 
cancer. In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the 
predominant source of estrogen. In postmenopausal 
women, estrogen derives predominantly from aroma-
tization of adrenal (see Adrenal Gland in Chapter 19, 
Endocrine System) and ovarian androgens in the liver, 
muscle, and adipose tissue.

Essential concepts

Fertilization, Placentation, and Lactation

• Fertilization encompasses three events:
  (1) The acrosome reaction.
  (2) Sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida.
  (3) Sperm-egg plasma membrane fusion.
As you remember, the acrosome, acro-
plaxome, and the condensed nucleus are 
components of the sperm head.    
  The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes 
(mainly hyaluronidase and proacrosin; the lat-
ter gives rise to acrosin during the acrosome 
reaction). 
  The acrosome consists of an outer acroso-
mal membrane facing the plasma membrane, 
and an inner acrosomal membrane facing the 
acroplaxome anchored to the nuclear enve-
lope of the condensed sperm nucleus. 
  The acrosome reaction occurs when the 
outer acrosomal membrane fuses at different 
points with the plasma membranes in the 
presence of Ca2+.

  Acrosomal-derived hyaluronidase facilitates 
sperm penetration across the corona radiata. 
Acrosin enables sperm penetration of the zona 
pellucida. 
  When the ﬁrst sperm binds to the zona 
pellucida (consisting of three glycoproteins: 
ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3), the protease ovastacin is 
released from the cortical granules located at 
the periphery of the egg cytoplasm. This event 
is called cortical reaction. 
  The following molecules and events are 
involved in fertilization: 

  (1) The sperm plasma membrane contains 
receptors with binding afﬁnity to O-oligosac-
charides of ZP3. 
  (2) The ﬁrst sperm to penetrate the zona pel-
lucida fuses with the eggs plasma membrane. 
Sperm fusion causes intracellular calcium oscil-
lations in the oocyte in response to a sperm-
speciﬁc phospholipase C. Ca2+-dependent 
exocytosis of ovastacin takes place and the 
conformation of the zona pellucida changes to 
prevent polyspermy.
  (3) Plasma membrane fusion occurs when 
the sperm protein Izumo1 binds to the egg 
protein Juno in the presence of the egg plas-
ma membrane protein CD9. Other proteins 
may be involved. 
  (4) The Izumo1–Juno complex is seques-
tered inside a vesicle that is released into the 
perivitelline space (between the zona pellucida 
and the plasma membrane of the egg).
  (5) Calcium oscillations lead the secondary 
oocyte to complete meiosis II, release the 
second polar body, and become haploid.
 
• Placentation starts with the implantation of 
the blastocyst into the endometrium after the 
blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida 
exposing the trophoblast layer.
   Implantation consists in:
  (1) The adhesion of the blastocyst to the en-
dometrial surface (a process called apposition).
  (2) Apposition is followed by implantation 
into the decidualized endometrial stroma with 

the help of the invasive trophoblast cells. This 
process is called interstitial invasion. 
  (3) Uterine receptivity is the optimal state 
of the endometrium for the implantation of 
the blastocyst. A primary decidual zone is 
remodeled into a secondary decidual zone by 
the action of local matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs).
  The trophoblast differentiates into:
  (1) An inner cell layer, the mitotically dividing 
cytotrophoblast.
  (2) An outer cell layer, the postmitotic syncy-
tiotrophoblast.  
  Proteolytic enzymes released by the syncy-
tiotrophoblast erode the branches of the spiral 
uterine arteries, forming lacunae. This event, 
called endovascular invasion, initiates the 
uteroplacental circulation. Lacunae represent 
the starting point of the future intervillous 
space of the placenta.
 
  Structural differences of the placenta villi:
  (1) Primary villi, the ﬁrst step in the devel-
opment of chorionic villi, are formed at the 
end of the second week. Primary villi consist 
of a cytotrophoblast core surrounded by the 
syncytiotrophoblast layer.
  (2) Secondary villi are formed early in the 
third week. Secondary villi consist of a core 
of extraembryonic mesoderm surrounded by 
the cytotrophoblast layer in the middle and an 
outer syncytiotrophoblast layer.
  (3) Tertiary villi are seen late in the third

week. Tertiary villi have a structure similar 
to the secondary villus in addition to fetal 
arteriocapillary networks in the extraembryonic 
mesoderm.
  The placenta consists of:
  (1) The chorionic plate (fetal component).
  (2) The decidua basalis (maternal component).
  These two components are the boundary 
of the intervillous space containing maternal 
blood. The intervillous space is partitioned 
by decidual septa into compartments, called 
lobes.   
  The decidual septa, extending from the de-
cidua basalis into the intervillous space, do not 
reach the chorionic plate. Therefore, the lobes 
are incomplete and the intervillous spaces are 
interconnected. 

   A chorionic villus consists of a stem giving 
rise to numerous villous branches.
  The core of the stem and villous branches 
contains extraembryonic mesoderm (mes-
enchymal cells), fetal blood vessels, and 
Hofbauer cells (a macrophage-like cell seen in 
early pregnancy). 
  The surface of the stem and its branches is 
lined by an outer syncytiotrophoblast layer and 
an inner cytotrophoblast layer supported by a 
basal lamina. The apical domain of syncytiotro-
phoblast cells displays short microvilli extend-
ing into the maternal blood space.
  In late pregnancy, cytotrophoblast cells 
decrease in number and disappear and syncy-
tiotrophoblast cells aggregate to form knots.

  According to their relation to the fetus, the 
decidua consists of three regions: 
  (1) Decidua basalis, the maternal compo-
nent of the placenta.
  (2) Decidua capsularis, the superﬁcial layer 
covering the developing fetus.
  (3) Decidua parietalis, covering the uterine 
cavity not occupied by the fetus. 
  The placental barrier is formed by the 
syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast layers 
supported by a basal lamina and endothelial 
cells and corresponding basal lamina of the fe-
tal capillaries. Fetal capillaries become closely 
apposed to the trophoblastic layer. Recall 
that the population of cytotrophoblast cells 
decreases with time and syncytiotrophoblast 
cells aggregate to form knots.

• Functions of the placenta: 
  (1) Exchange of gases by simple diffusion.
  (2) Transfer of maternal immunoglobulins.   
  (3) Production of steroids. Syncytiotropho-
blast cells synthesize progesterone, which is 
transferred to the adrenal cortex for its conver-
sion to weak androgens. Weak androgens are 
transferred to the syncytiotrophoblast for the 
conversion to estrogens. The placental–adre-
nal cortex cooperative mechanism represents 
the basis for the fetoplacental unit. 
  (4) Synthesis of chorionic gonadotropin 
(luteal-placental shift to maintain the corpus 
luteum of pregnancy) and placental lactogen 
(to condition the mammary gland for lacta-
tion).
  (5) Active transport of ions and glucose. 

• Disorders of the placenta include:
  (1) Ectopic pregnancy, consisting in implanta-
tion in the ampulla of the oviduct. 
  (2) Uterine atony deﬁnes weak contractions 
of the uterine muscle postpartum. 
  (3) Placenta previa is deﬁned by the abnor-
mal extension of the placenta over or close to 
the cervical canal. 
  (4) Placental abruption corresponds to 
the premature separation of the normally 
implanted placenta. 
  (5) Placenta accreta. The placenta invades 
the uterine wall but does not penetrate the 
myometrium. This condition, accounts for 75 
percent of all cases.
 (6) Placenta increta. The invading placenta 
penetrates through the myometrium. Placenta 
increta is seen in 15 percent of cases.
  (7) Placenta percreta is the extensive inva-
sion of placental villi through the thickness 
of the myometrium, the uterine serosa, and 
adjacent organs (urinary bladder and rectum).
  Abnormalities in the uterine wall, usually due 
to previous uterine surgery (such as cesar-
ean section or scar tissue following uterine 
curettage [Asherman syndrome]), increase the 
possibilities of placenta accreta. 

• Gestational trophoblastic diseases are clas-
siﬁed into three distinct types:
Hydatidiform mole  designates the partial 
or complete replacement of normal villi by 
dilated or hydropic (edematous) translucent 
vesicles. A fetus or embryo is often found in 
partial hydatidiform mole but no fetus is recog-
nizable in complete hydatidiform mole. 
  Total moles result from the fertilization of an 
empty egg (lacking a nucleus) by a haploid 
sperm that replicates within the egg. High 
levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
are characteristic in patients with hydatidiform 
moles. 
  Invasive mole is the most frequent form of 
trophoblastic disease generally diagnosed by 
persistent high blood levels of  hCG. It invades 
the uterine wall and cannot be detected on 
evacuated specimens. This condition responds 
to chemotherapy.  
  Choriocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm 
observed in about 50% of patients with molar 
pregnancies.  Choriocarcinoma is a hemor-
rhagic tumor in primary and metastatic sites. 
Treatment with combined chemotherapy 
agents is usually curative.

• Lactation includes the development, struc-
ture, and function of the mammary gland. The 
mammary gland is a branched (compound) 
organ with lactiferous ducts and tubuloalveolar 
secretory units forming a lobule in the lactating 
gland.  
  A lobe consists of a group of lobules drained 
by a lactiferous duct. The resting, nonlactating 
gland is formed by lactiferous ducts, each end-
ing in a group of blind saccular evaginations.
  The lactiferous duct is lined by a simple 
columnar or cuboidal epithelium and a discon-
tinuous layer of myoepithelial cells. Each secre-
tory unit, the alveolus, is lined by the alveolar 

mammary epithelium and basal myoepithelial 
cells, both supported by a basal lamina.

• Development of the mammary gland 
(mammogenesis). Placental lactogen, chori-
onic gonadotropin, and estrogen (produced 
by syncytiotrophoblast) stimulate the develop-
ment of the mammary gland. 
  The mammary bud, an ectodermic epithe-
lial derivative, extends into the mesoderm. 
Mammary buds give rise to 15 to 25 solid 
epithelial mammary cords under the inﬂuence 
of estrogens.  
  Mammary cords become hollow and change 
into mammary ducts. Bipotent stem cells 
contribute to the development of alveoli and 
mammary ducts, the future lactiferous ducts. 
The mesoderm differentiates into connective 
and adipose tissue stroma. In the male, the 
developing mammary duct system undergoes 
involution in the presence of testosterone.
  During puberty, estrogens stimulate the 
development of the lactiferous ducts. Alveolar 
buds develop under control of progesterone 
and regress. Epithelial cells lining the lactifer-
ous duct and alveolar buds are precursors of 
myoepithelial cells.
  During pregnancy (lactogenesis), lobular 
alveoli develop at the end of the lactiferous 
ducts under control of placental lactogen and 
estrogen, and maternal progesterone and 
prolactin.

  Milk production and ejection. The produc-
tion of milk in the mammary alveolar cells is 
controlled by prolactin. The ejection of milk is 
controlled by oxytocin acting on myoepithelial 
cells.
  Milk contains:
  (1) Proteins (casein, (cid:95)-lactalbumin,  para-
thyroid hormone–related peptide, and others) 
released by merocrine secretion.
  (2) Fat (triglycerides and cholesterol) re-
leased by apocrine secretion. 
  (3) Lactose produced in the Golgi apparatus 
and released together with proteins.
 (4) Secretory polymeric immunoglobulin A 
(pIgA) produced by plasma cells. PIgA is re-
leased into the alveolar lumen by transcytosis. 

• Tumors of the mammary gland. Benign 
breast diseases include ﬁbrocystic changes 
of the lactiferous ducts, and ﬁbroadenoma 
(masses of epithelial and connective tissue).
   Gynecomastia is the enlargement of the 
male breast.
  Breast cancer originates in the epithelial lin-
ing of the lactiferous ducts (80%). 
  Estrogen receptors and the tumor sup-
pressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 play an 
important role in breast tumors. 
  The most frequent breast tumors are the 
inﬁltrating duct carcinoma (originating in lactif-
erous ducts) and lobular carcinoma (derived 
from the epithelial cells lining the alveolar 
tissue). 
  Paget’s carcinoma extends from the lactifer-
ous ducts toward the nipple and areola. 
  Intraductal carcinoma consists of tumor cells 
growing within the lactiferous duct lumen.
