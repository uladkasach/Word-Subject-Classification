One  of  the  most  exciting  projects  that  a 
gardener  can  undertake  is  to  propagate  his 
own  plants.  Few  experiences  can  match  the 
thrill  and  awe  felt  by  a  gardener  who  has 
successfully  germinated  an  even  crop  of 
bedding  plant  seedlings  or  a  particularly 
difficult  woody  plant  seed,  or  who  has 
managed 
two 
grafted  parts  of  a  plant.

Plant  propagation  has  been  practiced  ever 
since  early  man  abandoned  his  itinerant  life 
and  settled  down  on  the  land,  where  he 
started  to  grow  his  own  food.  The  techniques 
of  vegetative  propagation  developed  in  such 
ancient  civilizations  as  those  of  the  Baby(cid:173)
lonians  and  the  Chinese  are  still  relevant  and 
in  use  in  the  twentieth  century. 

Using this  book 
The  object  of  this  book  is  to  try  to  present 
some  of  the  basic  facts  on  which  successful 
plant  propagation  is  founded,  so  that  the 
gardener  wishing  to  venture  into  this  field 
will  find  the  elementary  principles  explained 
and  will

It  is  not  intended  that  this  book  will  be  a 
complete  answerâ€”it  can  only  be  a  guide. 
Inevitably,  some  techniques  of  plant  propa(cid:173)

they  are  too  complicated  or  because  they  do 
not  always  produce  satisfactory  results.  Veg(cid:173)

satisfactory  ways  to  propagate  them. 

the  way 

How this  book  is  arranged 
The  concept  and  approach  in  this  book  is 
entirely  my  own,  based  on  my  experience 
gained  over 
the  past  20  years  evolving 
different  systems  of  plant  propagation  and 
teaching  both  horticultural  students  and 
amateur  gardeners. 

My  aim  has  been  to  try  to  present  propa(cid:173)

gation  techniques  in  their  logical  sequence, 
in seven separate sections. For example, I have 
placed  layering  in  the  same  section  as  stem 
cuttings  as  they  are  both  ways  of  inducing 
roots  on a  stem.  Until  now,  plant  propagation 
has  often  been  presented 
in  a  confusing 
manner:  root,  stem  and  leaf  cuttings  have 
lumped

logically

is 
little  or  no  relationship 
between  them. 

The  book  starts  with  a  glossary  of  propa(cid:173)

The  section  on  propagating  from  seeds  is 
divided  into  two  parts:  seeds  in  general,  and 
tree  and  shrub  seeds,  where  the  problems  of 
dormancy  are  explained.  The  information  on 
how  to  collect,  store  and  germinate  various 
kinds  of seeds  and  how to  look  after  seedlings 
is  of  vital  importance  to  any  gardener. 

The  book  then  presents  a  wide  range  of 
ways  to  propagate  vegetatively.  It  starts  with 
a  section  on  roots  and  progresses  through  to 
sections  on  modified  stems,  stems  and  leaves.

Dispelling the  mystique 
The  practice  of  plant  propagation  is  inclined 
to  be  surrounded  by  a  certain  mystique, 
despite  the  enlightened  modern  tendency  to 
share  knowledge.  The  "art"  of  plant  propa(cid:173)

are  not  magical  powers  confined  to  a  few

Undoubtedly  some  people  do  seem  capable 
of conjuring success without any basic knowl(cid:173)

perhaps  by  subconscious  observation,  noted 
correct  conditions  and  timing.  The  gardener 
who 
is  gifted  with  "green"  fingers  is  not 
dissimilar  to  the  person  who  is  "good"  with 
animals  or  who  has  the  capability  to  lead  or

Nothing,  however,  can  supersede the value 
of real  knowledge and  understanding that the 
gardener  needs  when  propagating  a  plant. 
Only  once  he  is  fully  versed  in  the  basic 
propagating  techniques  can  he  hope  to  be 
really  successful. 

Although  plant  propagation  is  completely 
logical  and  explainable,  some  gardeners  are 
definitely  more  successful  than  others;  and 
it  is  here  that  the  "art"  of  plant  propagation 
cannot  be  discounted.  The  "art"  is  in  inter(cid:173)

The  many  phases  of  plant  propagation 
The  actual  process  of  propagation  is  only  one 
of  many  phases  in  the  production  of  a  plant. 
The  other  phases  are  selecting  suitable 
plant  material;  preparing  it  so  it  has  a  high 
capacity  to  regenerate;  then  providing  suit(cid:173)

Selecting  suitable  plant  material 
Often  the  most  overlooked,  but  one  of  the 
most  significant,  phases  is  the  consideration 
and  choice  of  suitable  material  from  which 
to  propagate.  It  is  well  worth  the  extra  time

the  available  plant 
material  critically  so  that  the  best  selection 
is  chosen,  and  new  plants  are  not  produced 
from  inferior  stock.  Only  the  best  forms  and 
selections  of a  plant  should  be  earmarked  for 
propagation,  and  they  must  always  be  from 
healthy  stock, 
infections. 
Many  plants,  more  especially  the  older  and 
popular  selections,  will  have  deviated  from 
to  some  extent.  Despite  their

they  may  differ  quite  con(cid:173)

that  should  be  con(cid:173)

material,  and  the  highest  rooting  response 
will  be  found  in  a  plant  that  is  juvenile,  i.e. 
immature  and  unable  to  produce  flowers  or 
fruit.  As  soon  as  a  seed  germinates  and 
produces  a  juvenile  plant,  it  begins  to  "age" 
and 
to 
decline.  Most  plants  subsequently  enter  a 
mature  phase  when  their  regenerative  abili(cid:173)
ties  continue  to  decline.  Old  plants  and  older 
varieties  will  exhibit  very

that  old  and  very  old  plants  and 
varieties  will  be  difficult  to  propagate.  For 
example,  a  deciduous  azalea,  of  the  Exbury 
type,  which  was  germinated  from  seed  only 
about  40  years  ago,  will  be  much  easier  to 
propagate  than  a  Ghent  azalea,  which  would 
have  been  originated  over 140  years  ago.  It  is 
important  to  realize  this  distinction,  and  that 
all  plants  derived  from  one  selected  form 
must,  physiologically,  be 
the  same  age, 
regardless  of  when  they  were  vegetatively 
propagated. 

the  gardener  must  be  prepared 

Preparing  the  plant  material 
Having  chosen  the  most  desirable  forms,  the 
next  phase  is  to  prepare  the  material  so  that, 
when  the  time  comes  for  propagation,  it  will 
possess  its  maximum  capacity  to  regenerate. 

Such  preparation  of  highly 
regenerative 
material  can  be  done  by  growing  techniques 
such  as  pruning,  feeding  and  watering,  or  by 
forcing  the  plant  in  a  warmer  environment 
than  normal. 

Providing  suitable  conditions  for 
regeneration 
Next,  it  is  necessary  to  stimulate  this  plant 
material  to  regenerate  as  a  new  plant  by 
encouraging  the  processes  that  cause  the 
development  of  a  new  and  complete  plant. 
This can  be done  by placing the  plant  material 
in  a  suitably  controlled  environment,  such  as 
a  cold  frame  or  propagator.  This  will  not  only 
speed  up  regeneration  but  also  lessen  the 
chances  of  the  plant  material  dying  from 
rotting,  disease  or  exhausted  food  reserves. 
A  stem,  for  example,  can  also  be  encouraged 
to  produce  roots  by  dipping  it  in  a  rooting 
hormone  or  wounding  it  toward  its  base. 

The  ability  of  plant  material  to  regenerate 
is  also  influenced  by  the  different  seasons. 
Always,  therefore,  propagate  a  plant  during 
the  season  recommended  by  this  book. 

Ensuring  its  survival 
Once  the  plant  material  is  in  its  propagating 
environment,  it  is  vital  to  ensure  its  survival 
until  it  becomes  established. 

The  only  way  to  do  this  is  by  maintaining 

absolute  hygiene  in  the  propagating  environ(cid:173)
ment  and  by  thoroughly  cleaning  all  tools 
and  equipment.  Also,  treat  the  plant  material 
with  a  fungicide  such  as  Captan  or  Benlate, 

and  protect 
it  with  a  general  or  specific 
pesticide.  The  shorter  this  survival  period  the 
less  time  there  is  for things  to  go  wrong. 

Establishing the  new  plant 
As soon as the plant material has regenerated, 
the last phase in successful  propagation  is the 
establishment  of  this  young  material  as  an 
integrated,  self-supporting  new  plant.  When 
any  cutting,  such  as  a  leaf  or  stem,  is  taken, 
the  new  parts  that  are  required  to  form  a 
complete  new  plant will  need time to  become 
fully  integrated  with  the  original  cutting.  Just 
because  a  stem  cutting  produces  roots  does 
not  imply  a  new  plantâ€”both  systems  must 
grow  sympathetically  so  that  a  balanced  and 
integrated  growth  is  achieved. 
It  is  often 
relatively  simple  to  persuade  a  cutting  to 
regenerate  a  missing  part,  but  it  is  more 
difficult  to  establish  the  plant  material.  This 
has  to  be  done  by  weaning  it  from  its  pro(cid:173)
tected  environment  and  hardening  it  off  until 
it  is a self-supporting  individual  that can grow 
happily  in  a  normal  environment,  whether 
this  is  indoors  or  outdoors.  This  is  often  the 
hardest  part  of  plant  propagation.

tasks  of  plant  propagation  and  then  follows 
his  judgment  in  relation  to  a  particular  plant, 
he  can  always  approach  propagation  with 
confidence.  It  is  this  last factor that  underlies 
all  aspects  of  successful  propagation. 

To  propagate  plants  successfully,  it  is  neces(cid:173)

efficient  and  effective  tools  and  equipment 
and

Most  important  of  the  gardener's  special 
tools  and  equipment  for  plant  propagation 
are  a  sharp  knife,  a  pair  of  shears,  a  dibble, 
suitable  compost  and  a  selection  of  pots  and 
seed  trays.  Not  all  tools  or fancy  bits  of equip(cid:173)

The  use  of  suitable  tools  gives  the  plant 
material  the  very  best  start.  To  avoid  tearing 
and  crushing, for example,  always  use a sharp 
knife  or  razor  blade  and  a  clean  sheet  of glass 
when  preparing  a  softwood  cutting  for  plant(cid:173)
ing.  If the plant material  is damaged,  it will  die 
and  become  a  site  for  possible  rots  to  infect 
the  cutting.  By the  same token  it  is  important 

not  to  push  a  cutting 
into  the  compost; 
always  first  make  a  hole  with  a  dibble  of 
suitable  size,  and  then  plant  the  cutting  in 
that  hole.  A  dibble  should  be  approximately 
the  same  diameter  as  the  cutting  to  be 
planted. 

Although  many  people  will  use  a  kitchen 
table,  drain-board  or  greenhouse  bench, 
the  most  suitable  place  to  make  cuttings, 
graft  or  sow  seeds  is  a  bench  in  the  garden 
shed  with  a  convenient  shelf  for  all  the  bits 
and  pieces  of  equipment,  tools,  rooting  pow(cid:173)
ders,  etc.  The  height  of  the  bench  will  be  a 
critical  factor  to  the  comfort  of  the  gardener 
if  considerable  time  is  to  be  spent  propagat(cid:173)
ing or potting  plants. Incorrectly sited  benches 
will  encourage  or  enhance  backaches  and 
cricks  in  the  neck.  It is also  important to  have 
good  lighting  placed  directly  over  the  work(cid:173)
bench  itself. 

Plant  propagation  in  many  ways  is  akin  to 
surgery,  and  nowhere  is  there  more  routine

the  secret  of  success

gardener  lies  in  having  all  the  required  tools

in  good  working  order,  so  that  any  technique 
of  propagation  can  proceed  smoothly  and  all

After  use  it  is  important  to  clean,  service

The  main  problem  in  propagation  is to ensure 
survival  of  the  propagated  material  (be  it 
seed,  cutting  or  graft)  until  it  establishes  as 
a  new  young  plant.  If the  correct  material  has 
been  used  at  the  start,  and  as  long  as  any 
treatments  or cuts  have  been  made correctly, 
then  success  is  directly  related  to  the  control 
of the environment. The quicker the  regenera(cid:173)
tive processes can  be induced the less chance 
there  is  for  things  to  go  wrong. 

In  plant propagation there are two environ(cid:173)

into  humidity, 

ments:  the  aerial  environment,  which  can  be 
broken  down 
temperature, 
gaseous  balance  and  light  transmission;  and 
the  environment  of  the  medium  (soil  and 
compost),  which  covers  temperature,  moist(cid:173)
ure  status,  aeration  and  its  reaction  (acidity/ 
alkalinity).  Any  equipment  therefore  should 
be  measured  in  relation  to  the  effect  it  has 
on  these  factors. 

An  ideal  environment  is  one  that  allows 
minimum  water  loss  from  the  plant  material, 
cool  air  temperatures,  adequate  light  pene(cid:173)
tration  for  photosynthesis,  a  normal  atmo(cid:173)
spheric  balance  between  compost  and  air, 
good  drainage  and  warm  soil/compost  tem(cid:173)
peratures  with  a  neutral  acidity/alkalinity 
reaction.  The  degree  to  which  a  particular 
system  of  environmental  control  operates 
will  limit the  propagation  techniques that  can 
be  used  successfully  within  it.  In  general,  the 
"softer"  or  less  hardy  the  plant  material  the 
greater  will  be  the  degree  of  environmental 
control  needed 
to  achieve  success.  The 
vagaries  of  the  normal  climate  are  too  great 
for all  but the easiest and  hardiest  plants to  be 
propagated  successfully  outdoors. 

Cold  frames 
To  provide  initial  control  over  the  environ(cid:173)
ment,  place  a  box  with  a  lid  of  glass  on 
ordinary  soil.  This  cold  frame  environment 
helps  to  increase  soil  temperatures,  reduce 
temperature  fluctuation,  maintain  humidity 
and allow light penetration,  and  it can  be used 
for  the  propagation  of  a  wide  range  of  hardy 
plants. Its main disadvantage, which  is shared 
with  all  enclosed  environments,  is  that  air 
temperatures  build  up  when  conditions  are 
sunny.  This  necessitates  either  airing 
the 
frame to  reduce the temperature, and  thereby 
losing  humidity,  or  shading  the  glass  to  cut 
down  the  light  input,  and  so  reducing  photo(cid:173)
synthesis.

The  most  manageable  cold  frame  to  con(cid:173)

single  panes  of glass  held  in  separate wooden

can  be  laid  side  by  side  across  a  base  frame 
with a distance between  backboard and front-
board  of  4ft  9 in.  For  propagation  the  back(cid:173)
board  is  best  made  at  a  height  of  about  12 in 
and  the  frontboard  at  9 in.  The  slope  of  the 
roof should be pitched in a southerly direction. 
The  cold  frame  can  be  made  more  reliable  by 
improved sealing of any cracks in the structure 
and  by  double  glazing  with  two  layers  of 
"lights"â€”the  lid  of  a  cold  frame  being  called

the  greenhouse,  where 

Greenhouses 
The  next  step  in  the  sequence  of  environ(cid:173)
mental  control 
slightly  more  sophisticated  pieces  of  equip(cid:173)
ment  for  environmental  control  can  be  used. 
Greenhouses  can,  of  course,  be  of  a  wide 
variety  of  shapes  and  sizes.  Wooden-framed 
greenhouses  are  expensive 
to  purchase, 
maintain  and  keep  clean.  Metal  greenhouses 
are  less  expensive,  cheaper  to  maintain  and 
easier  to  keep  clean,  but  unless  they  have  an 
adequate  internal  structure  they  are  subject 
to  considerable  distortion  and  damage 
if 
exposed  to  high-velocity  winds. 

A  closed  case,  which  is  a  frame  with  a  lid 
of  glass  in  a  greenhouse,  provides  a  high-
temperature  system  for  propagation  of  house 
plants  and 
less  hardy  subjects.  Accurate 
control  of  temperature  can  be  attained  by 
installing  a  thermostatically  controlled  soil-
heating  cable,  which  will  provide  bottom 
heat,  into some sand  at the  base of the closed 
case. 

Mist  propagation  units 
The  ultimate  environmental  control  is  pro(cid:173)
vided  by  a  mist  unit.  This  is  an  open  system 
that  automatically  maintains 
the  moisture 
level  while  allowing  the  full  penetration  of 
light  and  the  use  of  bottom  heat  without  an 
increase  in  air temperature.  However,  such  a 
system  requires  both  electricity  and  water  in 
the  greenhouse. 

Propagators 
The  alternative  compromise  is  the  so-called 
"propagator."  This  is  a  portable  unit  and  can 
be  used  either  in  the  greenhouse  or  indoors 
provided  that  adequate  light  is  available.  It 
consists  of  a  fiberglass  base  fitted  with  a 
thermostat  and  heating  cables  and  a  Plexi-
glas-type  dome,  which  provides  the  closed 
environment.  All  sorts  of  variations  are 
available  so  make  sure  that  the  propagator 
you  buy  is  sufficiently  large  for  your  needs.

gated  plants.  Place  a  polyethylene  bag  over 
the  top  of  a  pot  or  tray,  and  support  it  either 
by  one  or  two  bamboo  rods  or  by  a  loop  of 
wire  with  an  end  stuck  in  the  compost;  seal 
with a rubber band. Make a tunnel  over plants 
outdoors by supporting polyethylene sheeting 
with  wire  and  then  sealing  the  ends. 

Without  doubt  the  most  important  piece  of 
equipment  needed  by  a  gardener  wishing  to 
propagate plants is a knife. Choosing it is per(cid:173)
haps  one  of  the  most  difficult  decisions  to 
make,  as  so  much  depends  on  what  sort  of 
work  it  will  be  required  to  carry  out. 

For  most  tasks,  a  medium-weight  knife 
with  a  sharp  carbon-steel  blade  is  best.  For 
grafting,  select  a  fairly  heavy  knife. 

A  budding  knife  has  a  spatula  end  for 
prying open flaps of bark. It is a useful  luxuryâ€” 
an  ordinary  propagation  knife  is  really  quite 
adequate.  For  very  soft  cuttings  from  plants 
such  as  dahlias,  chrysanthemums  and  pen-
stemons  the  best  tool  is  a  single-edged  razor 
blade  (that  is,  a  one-sided  blade  with  a  thick 
metal-covered  edge  on  the  opposite  side). 

Most  gardeners  use  a  knife  with  a  straight 
cutting  blade,  which  is  easy  to  sharpen,  but 
some  prefer  a  slightly  curved  blade.  A  knife 
with  a  very  curved  or  hooked  blade  is  not 

suitable  for  plant  propagation.  It

is  also 

A  knife  should  always  be  easy to  open  and 
comfortable  to  hold  when  in  use.  Especially 
with  knives  that  may  be  required  to  cut 
tough material, the blade when opened should 
be  set  back  into  the  handle.  This  avoids 
excessive  play  from  side  to  side  so  that  the 
blade  does  not  loosen. 

Knife  blades  are  either  hollow  ground  on 
both  sides  or on  one side  only:  both types are 
equally  efficient.  One-sided  knives  are  usually 
made  in  both  right-handed  and  left-handed 
patterns. As a general rule the more expensive 
a knife is,  the  better is the quality of blade and 
overall  design.  A good-quaiity steel  blade will 
maintain  its  sharp  cutting  edge  considerably 
longer  than  one  of  poorer  quality  and  is  well 
worth  the  extra  investment. 

Keep  a  knife  just  for  propagation  and  do 
not  use  it  for  pruning,  cutting  string  or  the

the  stem  and  the  right  thumb  above,  make  a 
shallow  angled  slice  from  beneath,  drawing 
the  right  forearm  backward  and  maintaining 
the  gap  between  the  right  thumb  and  the 
blade.  Never  attempt  to  cut  by  pressing  the

When  using  a  knife  for  cutting  plant 
material  the  blade  will 
inevitably  become 
clogged with  resins and  plant juices,  and these 
will  impair  the  cutting  efficiency.  Therefore 
after  use  clean  the  blade  either  with  a  rag 
dipped  in a solvent such  as gasoline or carbon 
tetrachloride  or  by  rubbing  the  blade  with  a 
fine  grade  of  emery  paper. 

Sharpening a  knife 
To  sharpen  a  knife  successfully  is  often  re(cid:173)
garded  as  a  difficult  and  specialist  job,  but  in 
fact  if  a  few  basic  rules  are  observed  it  is 
relatively  simple  provided  that  a  straight-
bladed  knife  is  used  and  that  the  sharpening 
is  carried  out  on  a  broad,  flat  Carborundum 
stone  with  a  coarse  and  fine  side.  The  stone 
should  be slightly  lubricated  with  a  light  oil  to 
aid  easy  movement. 

Push  the  blade gently  along the  coarse  side 
of  the  stone;  then  repeat  the  movement. 
Give a final  "rub"  on  its fine side.  After several 
turns,  repeat  the  operation  on  the  other  side 
of the blade. Always traverse the entire length 
of  the  stone  so  that  it  does  not  become 
unevenly  worn. 

All  sorts  of  curved  and  small  sharpening 
stones  are  available,  but  for  someone  not 
used  to  sharpening  knives  they  are  difficult  to 
handle  and  use  effectively.

Care  and  maintenance 
Shears,  more 
require 
constant  maintenance  if  they  are  to  remain 
effective.  After  each  session  wipe  the  blades 
with a solvent such as gasoline or carbon tetra-
chloride  and/or  fine  emery  paper  to  clean  off 
resins,  plant  juices  and  residues  that  other(cid:173)
wise  may  quickly  impair  the  cutting  edges. 
Then  wipe the  blades  with  light  oil  to  prevent 
rusting,  and  similarly  oil  all  the  moving  parts 
to  keep  them  in  good  working  order.

the 
leaflet  that  accompanies  the  tool  and  follow 
the  manufacturer's  instructions  carefully.  If 
no  instructions  are  supplied,  take  the  shears 
to  an  expert  for  sharpening. 

Making a  clean  cut 
When  using  shears  it  is  important  to  notice 
where  the  cut  is  actually  being  made;  the 
anvil  blade  is  often  quite  thick  and  it  is  not 
always  possible  to  see  the  actual  cut  when 
making  it.  Also,  ensure  that  any  cut  is  made 
with  the  anvil  blade  away  from  the  proposed 
cut surface so any bruising is  not incorporated 
in  the  propagated  material.

shears  to  make  a  cut  as  this  merely  bends 
the  blades,  damages  the  hinge  and  probably 
the  plant  material  as well.  When  dealing with 
a  thick,  hard  stem  move  the  blades  round  a 
bit  after  each  cut  until  they  cut  through  it. 

Although  a  sharp  knife  has  always  been 
regarded  as 
the  gardener's  main  cutting 
instrument  for  propagation,  modern  practice 
makes just as much  use of a suitably designed 
pair  of  shears;  and  where 
these  can  be 
used,  they  are  much  more  effective  than  a 
knife  because  they  are  quick  and  easy  to  use 
and  because they  are  also  less  liable  to  cause 
injury  to  the  plant  material. 

A  pair  of  shears  can  not  only  cope  with 
the final  cut  on  any stem  that  is firm  and  hard 
enough  to  cut  cleanly  but  can  also  be  used 
for  the  initial  cutting  of  softer  stems,  which 
may  at  the  final  stage  need  to  be  trimmed 
carefully  with  a  knife  or  razor  blade. 

There  are 

two  basic  shear  designs: 

the 
"anvil"  type  and  the  "scissor"  type.  Anvil 
shears  have  one 
sharp  blade,  usually 
hollow  ground  on  both  sides,  which  cuts 
through  the  stem  by  "crushing"  it  against  a 
broad  flat  surface  (the  anvil).  Scissor  shears 
also  have  one  sharpened  blade,  but  normally 
only  the  internal  surface  is  ground  flat.  This 
blade  cuts  by  rotating  past  the  anvil  blade  as 
in  a  conventional  pair  of  scissors.  The  scissor 
types  are  preferable  simply  because  they 
make  a  cleaner  cut  and  cause  less  crushing 
and  bruising  in  the  region  of  the  cut.  Other 
shear  designs  such  as  those  with  a  ratchet 
action  are  not  necessary  for  propagation. 

that 

they  are  easy 

When  choosing  a  pair  of  shears  ensure 
that  their  size  is  convenient,  the  handles  feel 
comfortable,  and 
to 
operate.  It  is  best  to  choose  a  spring-loaded 
pair  so  that  they  reopen  automatically  after 
each  cutâ€”it  is  tedious to  have  to  keep  open(cid:173)
ing  the  blades  for  each  incision.  Select  a  pair 
with  a  catch  that  keeps  the  shears  closed 
when  out  of  use  so  they  are  not  dangerous 
and the cutting edge is protected. Some types 
of  shears  have  a  sap  groove,  which  helps 
to  prevent  the  blades  sticking.  Like  all  tools 
for  propagation,  a  pair  of  shears  should 
ideally  be  kept  only  for  this  purpose  to  pre(cid:173)
vent  the  blades  becoming  prematurely  blunt 
and  ineffective. 

As with  knives  it  is  usually  possible to judge 
shears  on 
the  basis  of  cost:  expensive 
types  are  normally  well  designed,  easy  to 
dismantle  and  reassemble  and  have  good-
quaiity  steel  blades  that  retain  their  cutting 
edge  for  a  long  period. 

Normally  a  pot  is  as  deep  as  it  is  broad, 
but  both 
three-quarter  pots  and  half  (or 
dwarf)  potsâ€”sometimes  called  pansâ€”are 
available.  At  the  other  extreme  particularly 
deep  pots  called  "Long Toms"  are obtainable. 
Select  a  container  that  holds  only  sufficient

compost  as  a  2  3/4|in  square  pot.  However, 
square  pots  are  a  nuisance  to  fill  as  the 
gardener  must  be  sure  that  the  compost  is 
pushed  well  into  the  corners. 

Another  major 

initial  consideration 

is 
whether  to  use  rigid  or  nonrigid  containers. 
Pots  with  rims  tend  to  be  more  rigid  than 
those  without,  and  they  are  easier  to  stack. 
For  propagation  there  is  no  substitute  for 
rigidity,  although  nonrigid  containers  such  as 
black  polyethylene  sleeve  pots  may  be  used 
at  the  potting-on  stage.  The  problem  with 
nonrigid  containers  is  that  their  tendency  to 
sag  makes  them  a  nuisance  to  fill. 

scrubbing  and  sterilizing  between  use,  which 
is  time  consuming.  Because  clay  pots  are 
porous,  the  compost  dries  out  more  quickly 
than  it  would  in  plastic  pots,  and  so  more 
day-to-day  management  is  needed. 

Broad  pots  have greater  stability,  so,  where 
a  choice  is  available,  look  for  a  pot  with  a 
broad  base  and  almost  vertical  sides.  This 
shape  also  allows  a  greater  volume  of  com(cid:173)
post  within  the  pot  and  therefore  a  more 
usable  surface  area. 

A  vital  consideration  when  choosing  a  pot 
is  its  capacity for  drainage.  It  is  not  necessary 
to  crock  pots  if  a  well-drained  compost  is 
used,  but  the  base  of  the  pot  must  contain 
adequate  drainage  holes;  by  the  same  token 
if  a  capillary  watering  system  is  used  then 
there  must  be  adequate  holes 
the 
moisture  to  rise  up  into  the  compost  from 
the  capillary  medium,  be  it  sand  or  matting. 
Only  the  pot  shown  below  left  has  adequate 
drainage. 

for 

reduced 

The  material  from  which  a  pot  is  made  is 
also important. Traditionally, pots were always 
made  of  clay,  but  considerations  of  cost, 
durability  and  weight  (in  that  order)  have 
now 
their  use.  Nowadays  most 
rigid  pots  are  made  of  some  form  of  plastics 
and these  have the advantage of being cheap, 
lightweight  and  durable.  Some  plastic  pots, 
however, become brittle in time with exposure 
to  ultraviolet 
light.  Polypropylene  pots  of 
heavy quality will  generally provide  best value. 
Plastic  pots  are  also  easily  washed  and 
stored,  whereas  clay  pots  require  soaking. 

Because  of  the  problems  of  cost  many 
gardeners  use  yoghurt  cartons,  vending 
machine  cups,  and  cream  and  cheese  con(cid:173)
tainers  instead  of  "proper"  pots.  These  are 
quite  satisfactory  provided  they  are  clean, 
have  adequate  drainage  holes,  and  are  used 
in  conjunction  with  a  suitable  compost  and 
management  system. 

Square  pots  make  better  use  of  space  than 
round  ones  as  they  can  be  fitted  together 
exactly  to  cover  an  area  without  any  waste 
of  bench or ground space. They also generally 
contain  a  greater  volume  of  compost  relative 
to  their  surface  areaâ€”a  conventional  31/2  in 
diameter  round  pot  only  contains  as  much 

Pots 
A  plant  pot  is  perhaps  the  commonest  piece 
of  equipment  that  the  gardener  will  need  for 
propagation.  By  choosing  only  three  or  four 
sizes  in  the  same  pot  range,  tasks  such  as 
watering 
day-to-day  management 
become  standardized  and  are  thus  easier. 

and 

Seed trays 
When  dealing  with  relatively  large  numbers 
of  seedlings  or  cuttings,  as  happens  often  in 
the  production  of  bedding  plants,  a  tray  may 
be  a  more  suitable  container  than  a  pot. 

Traditionally a seed tray is made of softwood 
and  its  dimensions  are  14  in  by  81/2  in  and, 
according  to  its  required  usage,  either  2 in  or 
21/2  in  deep.  These  trays  are  now  relatively 
expensive  to  purchase  and  their  expected 
life  is  fairly  short  as  they  rot  easily.  However, 
they  have  the  distinct  advantage  of  being 
firm  and  rigid.

is  extraordinarily  variable; 

the  same  basic 
dimensions  are  currently  available  in  many 
different patterns. The most important charac(cid:173)
teristic  is  the  degree  of  drainage  permitted 
in  these,  and  it  is  of  paramount  importance 
to  ensure  that  this  is  adequate.  The  quality 
and  variety  of  plastics  used  for  making  seed

trays  are  those  of  a  sufficiently  thick  quality 
to  keep  their  shape  when  picked  up  at  a 
corner  and  of  a  type  not  to  become  brittle 
on exposure to ultraviolet light. The advantage 
of  plastics  is,  of  course,  their  durability  and 
that  they  can  be  readily  cleaned.  Plastic  seed 
trays  are  also  made 
"half-tray"  sizes 
measuring 6 in by 81/2 in and 2 in deep.

There  are  many  other  materials  such  as 
compressed  peat,  processed  paper  and  ex(cid:173)
panded  polystyrene  used  for  seed  trays,  but 
they  tend  to  require  careful  handling.  Some 
trays  are  disposable,  which  overcomes  the

Peat  pellets  and  soil  blocks 
As  an  alternative  to  pots  and 
is 
possible  to  substitute  a  system  that  obviates 
their  use:  the  idea  simply  being  to  plant  out 
or  pot  on  the  entire  unit.  This  is  achieved  by 
eliminating a  pot  altogether,  either  by  using  a 
peat  compost,  compressed  into  a  pellet  and 
contained  within  a  net,  that  swells  up  when 
soaked  with  water,  or  by  compressing  the 
compost  into  blocks. 

These systems are useful,  very effective and 
reduce  the  ultimate  root  disturbance  to  a 

minimum,  which  means  the  growth  of  the 
young  plants  is  not  checked  when  they  are 
transplanted. 

The  compressed  peat  pellets  as  typified  by 
the  "Jiffy  7"  are  expensive  but  seem  to  work 
very  well,  and  if  used  for  small  seedlings  or 
sturdy  cuttings  appear  almost  to  enhance 
rooting. 

The  high  initial  cost  of  purchasing  a  soil 
block  mold  may  deter  many  gardeners  who 
do  not  propagate  large  quantities  of  cuttings 
and  seedlings.  It  is  best  to  make  hexagonal 
soil  blocks  as  they  do  not  dry  out  so  readily 
provided  their  sides  touch  each  other.  To 
make  a  soil  block  successfully  it  is  important 
to  ensure  that  the  compost  has  the  correct 
level  of dampness. To test this, take a  handful 
of  moist  compost.  Squeeze  gently  but  firmly; 
the  compost  should  tend  to  crumble.  If  it 
falls  apart,  the  material  is  too  dry;  if  it  does 
not  start  to  crumble,  it  is  too  moist. 

Fill 

the  mold  with

pressing  it  only  until  the  particles  form  a 
block.  Place the soil  block  on  a tray and  leave 
it  to  consolidate  for  24  hours  before  inserting 
a  seed  or  cutting.  As  the  plant  grows  the 
roots  hold  the  block  together.  Plant  out  as 
soon  as  the  roots  emerge  through  the  sides 
of  the  soil  block.

Basically  a  compost  is  a  soil  substitute  for 
propagating  and  establishing  plants.  To  carry 
out  this  function  a  compost  requires  certain 
propertiesâ€”to  be  well  aerated, 
retain 
water, 
to  conduct 
warmth.  Thus  in  constituting  a  compost  the 
components  used  should  be  chosen 
to 
establish  these  particular  conditions  as  well 
as  maintaining  them  throughout  the  life  of 
the  compost.  In  order  to  prevent  the  occur(cid:173)
rence  of  pests,  diseases  and  weeds 
component  materials  should  also  be  sterile. 
The  only  component  of  a  compost  that  is 
not  initially  sterile  is  the  loam.  To  sterilize  it 
place the  loam  in  a  broad, flat  container  such 
as  a  meat  tin  and  put  in  the  oven  at  82Â°C/ 
180Â°F for 30  minutes.  Best results are obtained 
if  the  loam  is  dryish  and  if  the  tin  is  covered

help  prevent  desiccation  of  the  cutting,  and 
the  provision  of  an  aerating  agent  so  that  air 
can  always  circulate  within  the  medium. 

Conventionally,  peat  has  been  used  as  the 
water-retentive  component  and,  although

Sand  is  used  as  the  aerating  agent,  and  it 
also  allows  adequate  drainageâ€”peat  by  itself 
tending  to  become  waterlogged. 
cultural  parlance  sand  usually  means grit,  and 
for  these  purposes  a  washed  and  crushed 
lime-free  grit  providing  a  particle  size  of 
between  1/8in  and  1/16  in  across  is  the  most 
desirable.  The  particles  should  also  be 
"sharp,"  that  is  they  should  not  be  rounded 
but  have  points  and  corners  and  thus  be 
irregular  in  shape. 

Although  these  two  components  provide 
the  basic  compost  they  can  be  substituted 
with such items as sedge peat, well-weathered 
sawdust,  perlite,  vermiculite  and  graded  coal 
dustâ€”in  fact  by any  material  that  has  suitable 

physical  properties,  and  that  is  chemically 
inactive  and  biologically  more  or  less  sterile. 
Cuttings  composts  are  usually  formulated 
by  evenly  mixing  equal  parts  by  volume  of 
peat  and  grit,  although  it  is  often  difficult 
to  assess  how  much  sieved  peat  there  is  in 
a  particular  mix.  In  the  end  there  is  no  sub(cid:173)

Compost  for  germinating  seedlings 
The  composition  of  a  compost  for  seedling 
germination  does  not  differ  greatly  from  that 
produced  for  cuttings,  except  that  a  little 
more  attention  needs 
the 
nutrient  and  chemical  aspects.

The  basic  components  are  peat  and  sand 
and  for  germination  pure  and  simple  this  is 
sufficient.  However 
if  the  seedlings  are  to 
remain  in  the  compost  for  some  time,  add 
loam  to  act  as  a  buffer  in  holding  nutrients 
and  controlling  drying  out.  The  amount  of 
sterilized  loam  required  need  not  be  great:  a 
formula  of  2  parts  by  volume  peat,  2  parts 
sand  and  1  part  loam  is  satisfactory. 

As  seeds  are  much  more  sensitive  to  the 
acidity  in  such  a  compost,  lime  in  the  form 
of  ground  limestone  should  be  mixed  in  with 
the  sand  at  the  rate  of  11/2  oz  per  bushel  of 
compost. 

Although  it  is  not  usual  to  include  compli(cid:173)

cated  nutrient  mixes  in  seed  composts,  it  is 
important  to  ensure  that  sufficient  phosphate 
is  available.  Therefore  also  mix 3/4oz super(cid:173)
phosphate  per  bushel  of  compost  in  with  the 
sand. 

Potting  composts  for  growing on  young

the  development  of  a 

Nowadays  such  composts are based  on the 
use  of  peat,  although  traditionally  the  John 
Innes  concepts  were  based  on  the  use  of 

sterilized  loam. The  recommendation  of loam 
as  a  base  for  composts  has  had  to  be  dis(cid:173)
continued  because  it  is  no  longer  feasible  to 
obtain  a  standard  material  on  which  a  recipe 
can  be  formulated.  Peat  is  capable  of  being 
relatively standardized  and  so currently forms 
the  basis.  It  is  important,  however,  to  realize 
that  loam  has  a  steadying  and  controlling

fully. Their main disadvantage is their capacity 
for  drying  out  and  the  difficulty  of  rewetting 
a  dried  compost,  although  this  latter  factor 
is  less  of  a  problem  if  a  wetting  agent  has 
been  incorporated.  Their  chief  advantage  is 
that  they  are  ready  mixed  and  come  packed 
in  handy-sized  plastic  bags. 

If  a  peat-based  compost  proves  difficult 
to  rewet,  then  add  a small  quantity  of wetting 
agent  or  spreader  such  as  soft  soap.  Do  not 
use  wash-up  liquids.

The  important  aspect  of  mixing  compost  is 
to  obtain  an  even  and  uniform  end  product.

in  plants  when  used 

Certain  chemicals  will  promote  or  regulate 
growth  responses 
in 
minute  dosages,  and 
they  are  used  by 
gardeners  not  only  for  plant  propagation  but 
also  to  achieve  a  variety  of  other  responses, 
such  as  encouraging  fruit  trusses  to  set. 

These  plant-growth-regulating  substances 
work  at  very  low  concentrations  and  within 
very  critical 
limits;  a  substance  that  sets 
fruits  at  one  concentration  and  produces 
roots  on  stem  cuttings  at  another  may  be 
used  as  a  weedkiller  at  yet  another.  Thus  it  is

sponses  if  the  inherent  ability  of  the  stem  to 
produce  roots  is  not  present.  Their  action  is 
merely  to  enhance  the  innate  capacity  of the 
stem  to  produce  its  roots  both 
in  greater 
quantities  and  quicker  than  might  otherwise 
have  been  the  case.  If  the  stem  cutting  is 
propagated  from  a  healthy  plant  and  at  the 
correct season, then the use of such hormones 
is  usually  of  no  advantage  whatsoever.  They 
should  be  used  with  knowledge,  and  only  as 
and  when  they  are  likely  to  achieve  an  effect. 
The  majority  of  rooting  hormones  available 
on  the  market  are  constituted  as  powders, 
the  base  simply  being  finely  ground

important  to  emphasize  that  these

to 

In  actually  applying the  hormone therefore 
take  care  to  touch  only  the  basal  cut  surface 
onto  the  powder  so  that  no  powder  adheres 
to  the  outside  of  the  stem;  do  not  dip  the 
cutting even  as deep as 1 in. 

By  applying  the  hormone  the  roots  are  in(cid:173)
duced  to  form,  but  if they  emerge  and  come 
into  contact  with  the  hormone  still  on  the 
bark  this  may  cause  the  roots  to  die  off.  In 
many  cases  this  does  not  happen  totally,  but 
it  may  cause  losses  in  some  plants  or  under 
certain  conditions;  it  is  prudent  to  adopt  a 
system  that  is  suitable for  all  plants. 

If  there

surface  at  the  base  of  the  cutting  then  the 
cutting  should  first  be  dipped  in  water.  This 
is  an  especially  valuable  hint  with  softwood 
cuttings,  which  will  benefit  from  the  water 
anyway. 

to 

Make  up  water-based 

formulations  by 
dissolving a pill  in a specified amount of water. 
Then  stand  the  base  of  the  cutting  in  the 
solution for 12-24 hours.  As the concentration 
of  water-based  rooting  hormones  is  much 
lower  than  powder-based  ones,  the  bark  is 
not  adversely  affected  and  so  the  cutting 
can  be  left  standing  in  any  depth  of  the 
solution. 

If  an  alcohol-based  solution  is  used,  dip 
the  base  of  the  cutting  in  solution  and  allow 
to  drain  so  that  the  alcohol  can  evaporate, 
leaving  the  hormone  on  the  cuttings. 

WOUNDING  STEM  CUTTINGS 
Since  certain  chemicals  are  capable  of 
enhancing  root  production  on  a  stem 
cutting,  it  is  possible that  other techniques 
may also cause a surge in  natural  hormone 
production  that  could  improve  rooting. 

In  some  plants  there  exists  in  the  stem 
between  the  bark  tissues  and  the  wood 
tissues  a  sheath  of  material  that  is  capable 
of  inhibiting  root  development.  However, 
when  part  of this  sheath  is  damaged,  then 
roots  will  be  produced  normally.  This 
damage  is achieved  by a technique  known 
as wounding. 

The  commonest  method  of wounding  is 
to  remove  a  slice  of  bark  from  the  bottom 
inch  or  so  of  the  cutting,  using  a  sharp 

knife  so  that  the  wood  tissues  are  just 
exposed.  Alternatively  make  three  or  four 
1 in  long  incisions  in  the  bark  at  the  base 
of the cutting as  deep  as the wood tissues. 
The  technique  of wounding  can  be very 
effective  with  rhododendron,  daphne  and 
juniper,  but  it  is  unwise  to  use  it  as  a 
matter  of  course  as  it  provides  another 
possible  site  for  infection  and  rotting.  It 
may only be necessary on  older,  hardwood 
cuttings; softwood cuttings do not normally 
require  wounding.  The  need  to  wound  a 
cutting  will  only  be  discovered  in  the  light 
of  experienceâ€”a  continued 
to 
root  a  cutting,  which  cannot  be  attributed 
to  any  other cause,  may  then  suggest that 
the  cutting  may  respond  to  wounding.

The  use  of  water 
in 
potted  plants  is  seldom  efficient.  The  main 
difficulty  is  that  the  gardener  is  unable  to

the  correct 
quantities,  as

number  of  automatic  and  semiautomatic

Moisten  freshly  potted seedlings and rooted 
cuttings  with  tepid  water.  Avoid  cold  water, 
which  will  only  check  growth  and  lower  soil 
temperatures.  If  the  local  water  is  hard,  it  is 
better  for  the  plants  to  use  rainwater. 

Place a tank of water in a greenhouse where 
it will  be warmed  to the ambient temperature. 
The  tank  of  water  has  the  further  advantage 
of  providing  an  evaporating  surface,  which 
will  help  to  maintain  high  levels  of  humidity 
in  the  greenhouse. 

The  biggest  problem  facing the  gardener  is 
knowing  when  sufficient  water  has  been 

applied.  To  gain  experience  use  a  minimum 
number  of  pot  types  and  sizes,  and  as  far  as 
possible  stick  to  one  compost  formula  so 
that  experience  of  these  limited  conditions 
will  improve  watering  technique.

of  plant  production. 

t he  three  so-called  major  elements  that 
are  required  for  successful  plant  growth  are 
nitrogen,  potassium  and  phosphorus.  These 
materials  are  needed  in  addition  to  carbon,

The  only  two  nutrients  that  may  cause 
problems  are  magnesium  and  iron.  The  prime 
role  of  magnesium 
is  in  the  formation  of 
chlorophyll,  the  green  coloring  in  the  plant. 
A  lack  of  it  is  typified  by  a  yellowing  of  the 
older  leaves as the  plant transfers  magnesium 
from  its  older  parts  to  its  newly  created  parts 
so  causing  the  "chlorosis"  in  the  old  leaves. 

Iron  has  a  similar  function  to  magnesium 

nutrient,  and  not  one  with  only  that  nutrient 
in  it,  and  use  it  as  recommended. 

Organic  fertilizers  such  as  bonemeal  and

In  the  closed  environment  of  pot  or  seed

should  also  be  avoided  as they  may  have too

also  upset  the  balance  of the  other  nutrients. 
If  the  gardener  is  plagued  with  regular 
magnesium  deficiency  substitute  magnesian 
limestone  (Dolomite  limestone)  for  ordinary 
limestone  in  the  compost. 

Acid-loving  plants  and  ericaceous  ones 
such  as  heathers  and  rhododendrons  are 
liable  to  have  an  iron  shortage  and  this  can 
be  treated  with  a  chelated  iron  compound

The  greatest  stumbling  block  to  successful 
plant  propagation  is  the  loss  of  cuttings  and 
seedlings from  the  action  of various  pests  and 
diseases.  In  many  cases  this  occurs  because 
the  gardener  has  failed 
to  maintain  good 
hygienic  standards. 

A  system  for  successful  propagation  must 
be  based  on  regular  prevention  and  control 
of  all  possible  pathogens. 
It  is  not  just  a 
question  of  keeping  the  cuttings  or  seedlings 
free  of  such  agencies;  it  is  also  necessary  to 
practice  good  standards  of  hygiene  in  the 
potting  and  propagation  environment,  the 
containers  and  tools  used  for  propagation, 
the  composts,  the  propagating  material  itself 
and  the  subsequent  husbandry  practiced.

not  attempt  to  reuse  spent  compost,  even

out  of  proportion. 

The  plant  material  itself  must  also  be  free

caution  against  disease,  dip  leafy  cuttings  in 
a  dilute  solution  of  fungicide  such  as  Captan

Insects,  such  as  greenfly  and  blackfly,  are 
invariably  present  in  small  populations  on

Red  spider  mites 
These  are  not,  in  fact,  insects  but  are  related 
to  the  spider.  They  have  eight  legs  and  are 
capable  of  spinning  webs.  Most  of  them  are 
minute  and  are  comparatively  difficult  to  see, 
but  because they  normally  occur  in  such  vast 
quantities  their  collective  action 
is  readily 
apparent. 

A  typical  sign  of  their  presence  is  for  a

It  is  in  the  propagating  environment  with 
its  increased  temperatures  that  populations 
of  red  spider  mites  can  build  up  unchecked, 
and  they  can  cause  problems  on  plants  as 
diverse  as  cucumber,  cyclamen,  dahlia  and 
conifers. 

Available  methods  of  control  are  not 
always  effective  as  the  most  useful  materials 
are  also  dangerous  to  humans.  The  easiest 
system  is  simply  to  keep  populations  to  a 
minimum  by  reducing  the  mites'  hibernation 
stage  by  routinely  scrubbing  down  all  propa(cid:173)

Sciarid  flies 
The  movement  of  these  very  small  black-

flies  themselves.  They  are  a  relatively  new 
phenomenon  and  are  probably  associated 
with  the  increasing  use  of  peat-based  com-

posts.  The  adults  are  attracted  by  peat, 
especially  when  it  is  wet,  and  they  will  lay 
their  eggs  in  it.  The  small  white  grubs  that 
hatch 
is 
available â€” in  this  situation  usually the  young, 
freshly succulent roots of a cutting or seedling. 
Most damage is caused when the compost is 
overwatered,  so  more  eggs  are  laid  and  more 
roots  are  consumed.  Therefore  to  control 
infestation  of  sciarid  flies  do  not  allow  the 
compost  to  be  continually  soaked.  Water 
little  and  often. 

Chemical  control  is  not  easy.  The  adults 

im(cid:173)
because  of  their  mobility  are  virtually 
possible to kill, and control  is therefore limited 
to  an  attempt  to  eliminate  the  larvae.  The 
incorporation  of  a  granular  insecticide  in  the 
compost  will  have  some  effect  as  a  pre(cid:173)

results  are  achieved  by  drenching  the  com(cid:173)

Vine  weevils 
The  larvae  of  the  vine  weevil  do  much  more 
damage than  is suspected, and although they 
are  obviously  not  just  pests  of  propagation 
areas  they  can  nevertheless  cause  havoc  in 
newly  potted  young  plants.  If  any  seedlings 
or young  plants  collapse  suddenly,  they  have 
most  likely  been  attacked  by  vine  weevils. 
The  adult  weevil  lays  its  eggs  in  soil  or  com(cid:173)

The  only  satisfactory  method  of  control  is

Glasshouse  whiteflies 
These  are  one  of the  most  troublesome  pests 
of plants  grown  under glass. The small, white, 
mothlike  adults  and 
the  greenish-white 
scalelike 
lower  leaf 
surfaces  both  feed  by  sucking  sap,  and  they 
excrete  a  sugary  substance  known  as  honey(cid:173)
dew. This  makes the foliage  sticky  and  allows 
the  growth  of  a  black,  sooty  mold.  The 
larvae  are  fairly  tolerant  of  most  insecticides, 
unlike  the  adults  which  can  be  controlled  by 
insecticides  containing  pyrethrum,  biores(cid:173)
methrin  or  resmethrin. 

Slugs  and  snails 
Slugs and snails feed on the seedlings of many 
crops.  Routine  use  of  slug  bait  should  keep 
damage  to  a  minimum.  If  there  is  a  sudden 
infestation  treat  with  metaldehyde. 

A  propagating  environment  often  provides 
suitable  conditions  for  the  establishment  and 
spread  of  certain  diseases,  but  these  should 
not  become  a  major  problem  provided  that 
correct hygienic  procedures are followed.  It is 
important  for  the  gardener  to  recognize  the 
symptoms  of these  diseases  and to  know  how 
to  apply  the  appropriate  control  measures. 

Gray  mold 
This  disease  is  caused  by  a  fungus  called 
Botrytis  cinerea,  from  which  it  obtains  its  other 
common  name,  botrytis.  It  is  an  organism  of 
general  occurrence  and  is  capable  of varying 
degrees  of parasitism.  It thrives  in  cold,  damp 
conditions,  and  it  can  be  recognized  by  a 
brown  area  of  rotting anywhere  on  a seedling 
or  cutting,  which  eventually  grows  a  cover(cid:173)
ing  of  grayish  mold.  Once  it  obtains  a  foot(cid:173)
hold  it  is  by  no  means  easy  to  control  its 
spread.  To  avoid  an  outbreak  of  gray  mold, 
place  any  seedlings  and  cuttings  in  a  well-
ventilated  warm  atmosphere  and  maintain 
strict  levels  of  hygiene.  If an  infection  occurs, 
the  affected  plants  should  be  picked  out 
carefully and  destroyed. The remaining  plants 
should then be sprayed with Captan, benomyl 
or 
to  cut  down  any 
further  spread  of  the  disease,  but  too  regular 
use  of the  latter  two  fungicides  could  lead  to 
the  buildup  of  resistant  strains  of  the  fungus. 

thiophanate-methyl 

when  threads  of  the  fungus,  which  resemble 
fine  cotton  wool,  spread  rapidly  in  the  soil  or 
over  the  compost  surface.  As  it  comes  into 
contact  with  seedlings  the  parasitic  fungus 
penetrates  the  tissues,  which  then  die.  The 
problem  is  particularly  acute  as  these  fungi 
are  always  present  in  soil  or compost  and  are 
capable  of  survival  without  parasitism.  Old 
soil  or  compost,  therefore,  provides  a  source 
of  infection  and  should  never  be  reused  for 
seed  sowing  or  cuttings.  The  effects  are 
compounded  when  seedling  densities  are 
high;  if  temperature  conditions  are  too  hot 
or  too  cold  for  strong  seedling  development; 
if  ventilation  is  poor  and  the  soil  too  damp; 
and  if  the  seedlings  or  cuttings  suffer  frost 
damage. 

The  disease  can  be  recognized  when  seed(cid:173)

lings  or  cuttings  suddenly  die  in  patches. 

To  avoid  damping-off  disease  sow  seeds  at 
a  correct  density  so  that  the  seedlings  are 
not  overcrowded;  give  them  plenty  of  light, 
air  and  warmth,  and  do  not  overwater.  Spray 
the  seedling  area  before  germination  with  a 
solution  of  Captan  or  a  copper  fungicide. 
Further  control  may  also  be  achieved  after 
the  seeds  have  emerged  by  spraying  again 
with  Captan  or  zineb. 

If  damping-off  diseases  do  become  estab(cid:173)

plant propagation the disease normally affects

these  symptoms  are  typified  by  a  yellow

symptoms,  however,  should  not  be  confused 
with  the  yellowing  caused  by  magnesium  or 
iron  deficiencies  (see  page  15). 

indicating 

Unfortunately it is not possible for gardeners 
to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  disease  from  a 
virus-infected  plant. All that can  be done is to 
attempt  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  disease 
by  digging  up  and  burning  the  whole  of  the 
infected  plant. 

Some  virus  diseases  are  carried  by  aphids 
that  infect  other  plants  when  feeding;  the 
spread  of  virus  diseases  to  uninfected  plants 
is  therefore  best  controlled  by  the  routine 
use  of  pesticide  smoke  canisters  or  sprays. 
Virus  diseases  can  also  be  spread  by  eel(cid:173)
worms  in  unsterilized  soil,  or  merely  by  con(cid:173)
tact  from,  for  example,  a  propagation  knife, 
After  cutting  virus-infected  plants  a  knife  will 
be a fertile area for infection.  Always disinfect 
propagation  tools  and  your  hands  if  virus 
diseases  are  suspected. 

The  only  satisfactory  way  to  avoid  trouble 
when  propagating  is  by  using  plant  material 
that is virus free. This is a counsel of perfection 
as  it  is  not  easy for the gardener to  recognize 
with  certainty  virus  symptoms 
in  many 
plants.  Although  viruses  may  be  passed  on 
through  the  seed  it  is  possible  to  raise  fresh 
virus-free  stock  of  certain  plants,  such  as 
Daphne  mezereum,  where  viruses  do  not 
appear  to  be  transmitted  by  seed.  Virus-free 
rootstocks  are  labelled  EMIA,  and  they  are 
available for  some  fruit  trees  and  a few  orna(cid:173)
mental  crabs  and  cherries. 

Some  virus  diseases,  such  as  Daphne 
mosaic,  can  be  recognized  by  holding  the 
leaf  up  to  the  light  and  by  identifying  the 
mosaic  pattern  of  lighter  yellow  color.  Others 
are  more  difficult 
recognize  and  may 
frequently  be  confused  with  mineral  de(cid:173)

Seeds  are  a  resting  and  survival  stage  in 
the  continuance  of  a  plant's  existence. 
Basically  a  seed  consists  of  an  embryo,  which 
is the young plant at its  most immature and  in 
its  simplest  components;  a 
food  supply, 
which  maintains  the  embryo  throughout  the 
resting  period  and  provides  the  basis  for 
further  development  when  germination  gets 
under  way;  and  a  seed  coat,  which  acts  as 
the  protective  component.  The  embryo 
consists  of  the  young  root  system,  or  radicle; 
the  young  stem  system,  or  plumule,  which 
carries  the  seed  leaves,  or  cotyledons  (which 
may  be  adapted  for  food  storage);  and  the 
hypocotyl,  which  is the junction  between the 
root  and  shoot  system.  Examples  of  different

Survival  of  drying,  however,  is  not  just  a 
function  of  the  stored  food;  it  also  reflects 
the  condition  of  the  seed  coat  and  its  ability 
to  protect  the  seed.  Plants,  such  as  willows, 
with very poorly developed  seed  coats survive 
for  only  very  short  periods,  while

Dustlike  seeds,  such  as  those  from  rhodo(cid:173)
dendrons and  lobelia,  have a low germination 
and  survival  rate. 

Seeds  also  vary  greatly  in  the  materials 
that  they  use  as  food  reservesâ€”that  is  the 
stored  food  in  the  seed.  Those  plants  that 
store  food  as  carbohydrates,  such  as  elder(cid:173)
berries, marigolds and laburnum, are generally 
stable  and 
long-lived,  and  will  withstand 
drying.  Seeds  that  store  food  as  fats  or  oils, 
for  example  peony,  magnolia  and  chestnut 
seeds,  deteriorate  both  with  time  and  drying 
and  so  present  problems  of  storage  and 
survival.  It  is  better  to  allow  these  seeds  to 
mature  on  the  plant  and  collect  them  just 
before  dispersal. 

The  variation  in  characteristics  of the  seed, 
and  more  often  the  fruit,  are  endless;  some 
seeds  and 
fruits  have  large  wings,  hooks 
or  other  projections  that  provide  an  aid  to 
dispersal,  and  these  can  easily  be  trimmed 
or  rubbed  off. The shape of a seed  is designed 
so  that,  when  it  is  dispersed,  it  will  fall  to  the 
ground  and  lie in the  best  position for germin(cid:173)

Commercial  seeds 
As  well  as  being  sold  loose  in  packets,  seeds 
are  now  available  commercially 
in  other 
forms  that  make  sowing  easier  and  more 
accurate.  Pelleted  seeds  are  coated  with  de(cid:173)
composable  material  which  disintegrates 
when  in  contact with  moisture.  It is especially 
convenient  to  buy  small  seeds  in  this  form 
as  they  are  much  easier  to  handle  and  sow. 
Seeds  can  also  be  purchased  evenly  spaced 
on  a  tape  of  decomposable  paper  or  plastic. 
Just  cut  the  tape  to  the  required  length  and 
place  it  in  a  furrow  1/2in  deep  and  then  cover 
with soil. 

Although  it  is  usual  to  buy  seeds  it  is  often 
quite  possible  for  the  gardener  to  collect, 
extract  and  store  his  own  seeds.  This 
is 
especially  satisfactory  with  seeds  from  trees 
and  shrubs, which are dealt with  separately on 
pages  28-32. 

It  is  important  to  label  each  stock  of  seed

Annual  bedding  plants  are  selected  strains 
that  have  been  line-bred  to  come  true  from 
seed. The  problem  in  collecting  seed to  come 
true  is  that  a  plant  may  have  been  chance-
pollinated  by a different variety or species,  and 
so  hybrid,  atypical  plants  will  be  produced. 
Commercially,  the  seed  is  kept  true  to  type 
by  growing  the  parent  plants  in  large  isolated 
blocks.  Certain  plants,  such  as  pansies,  are 
self-pollinating and their seed can be collected 
with  confidence  that  they  will  come  true. 

Collecting  and  drying flower  seeds 
Except  for  those  seeds  that  are  collected  and 
sown 
"green,"  such  as  snowdrops  and 
anemones,  the  majority  of  herbaceous  plants 
are collected, dried and extracted, and stored. 
Their  seeds  should  be  collected  as  they

used  in  its  survival;  thus  less food  is  available 
for the embryo at germination,  and so germin(cid:173)
ation  becomes  progressively 
less  vigorous. 
Storage  conditions  should  keep  activity  to  a 
minimum. 

Seeds  should  be  stored  dry  in  linen  bags, 

paper  bags  or  packets,  or  cellophane  en(cid:173)
velopes;  plastics such as  polyethylene are not 
advisable  for  flower  and  vegetable  seeds  as

Always  keep  seeds  dry  and  store  them  in 
a  cool  place  such  as  a  loft,  cellar  or  possibly 
a  refrigerator.  If there  is a danger of dampness 
from  the  environment,  place  the  packets  in  a 
polyethylene  bag  for  protection. 

If properly dried,  most flower and vegetable 
seeds  can  be  stored  for  two  or  three  years  at 
least,  because they  store their foods as carbo(cid:173)

GENETICS 
Plants  grown  from  the  seed  of  species  or 
stable  variants  will  come  "true,"  that  is  be 
similar  to  the  parents.  If,  however,  one 
parent  is  unstable  or  normally  propagated 
vegetatively,  then  the  offspring  will  in  all 
probability  be  of  the  normal 
forms  of 
species  and  not  of  the  variant. 

In  plant  breeding  there  is  much  use  of 
the  technique  known  as F1 hybridization. 
This  is  an  involved  process  in  which  two 
true-breeding  species,  or stable variants  of 
the  species,  are  crossed  to  produce  a 
hybrid  generation  (the  first 
filial  or  F1 
generation).  The  advantage  of  these  hy(cid:173)
brids  is  that  they  are  often  more  vigorous 
than  their  parents  and  may  have  charac(cid:173)
teristics  of  height,  form  and  color  that 
make  them  more  desirable. 

then 

If  these  F1  hybrids  cross, 

their 
offspring,  the  F2  generation,  will  not  be 
like  the F1 hybrids  but  will  revert  to  many 
characteristics of the original true-breeding, 
parents.  Hence  the F2 generation  will  not 
possess  all 
the  desirable  characteristics 
that  were  present  in  the F1 generation  and 
it is therefore necessary to produce F1 seed 
afresh  each  year. 

To  assist  with  germination  and  the  establish(cid:173)
ment  of  a  new  plant,  it  is  often  helpful  to 
soak  seeds  in  water  for  12-24  hours  before 
being  sown  in  a  compost  that  will  provide 
adequate  aeration,  sufficient  water-holding 
capacity,  a  neutral  acidity/alkalinity  reaction 
and  sufficient  phosphate.  Thus  a  "sowing"  or 
"seed"  compost  should  be  used. 

Before  choosing  a  pot,  pan  or  tray  decide 
how  much  seed  is  to  be  sown;  the  container 
should  be  large  enough  to  allow the  seedlings 
space  to  develop  to  the  size  at  which  they 
are  to  be  pricked  out. 

Heap 

the  container  with  compost  and 
then,  to  ensure  it  is  evenly  distributed  and 
there  are  no  air  locks,  very  lightly  firm  it  to 

the  corners  and  base  using  the  fingers.  Do 
not  compact  the  compost. 

Using  a  sawing  action,  strike  off  the  com(cid:173)

post  with  a  presser  board  or  other  piece  of 
wood  so  that  it  is  level  with  the  top  of  the 
container.  Then  with  a  presser  board  that  fits 
into  the  container,  lightly  and  evenly  firm  the 
compost  to 1/4-3/8 in  below  the  rim,  ensuring 
that  the  surface  is  level. 

The  container  is  now  prepared  for  sowing. 
The  seeds  should  be  sown  evenly  over  the 
surface  either  by  sowing  large  seeds  one  by 
one  or  gently  shaking  small  seeds  direct  from 
the  packet.  When  shaking,  keep  the  packet 
low  over  the  compost  to  prevent  the  seeds 
being  unevenly  distributed.  If  the  seeds  are 

very  fine  it  is  easier  to  distribute  them  evenly, 
and  see  where  they  are  sown,  if  they  are 
mixed  thoroughly  with  some  dry  fine  sand. 
Sow  the  seeds  by  shaking  across  the  con(cid:173)
tainer,  using  about  half  the  seeds;  then  turn 
the  container  through  90  degrees  and  sow 
the  rest  of  the  seeds  in  the  same  way. 

Gently  shake  some  compost  over 

the 
container  through  a  1/8in  sieve  so  that  an 
even  and  uniform  layer covers the seeds.  As a 
general  rule  seeds  do  not  need  to  be  covered 
by  compost  deeper than  their  own  thickness. 
Finally  label  the  seeds  and  water  them  in 
by  standing  the  container  in  a  shallow  bath 
of  water  so  that  the  water  moves  up  by 
capillary  action.  Do  not  stand  the  container 

in  so  much  water  that  it  overflows  the  rim 
onto  the  seeds  and  compost.  After  watering 
stand  out  to  drain.

Start  pouring 
the 
container  and  once  an  even  flow  is  attained 
direct  it  over  the  seeds;  similarly,  to  stop, 
move  the  water  away from  the  container  and 
then  stop  the flow,  so  that  no  drops  fall  on  to 
the  compost. 

Cover  the  container  with  a  piece  of  glass 
and  place  in  a  warm  dark  place,  for  example 
an  airing  cabinet.  Otherwise,  cover  with 
glass  and  a  sheet  of  paper  and  leave  in  any 
warm  (2T'C/'70'F)  environment. 

Germination 
The  germination  of  seeds  covers  the  entire 
process,  from  subjecting  a  resting  seed  to 
suitable  conditions  to  cause  it  to  develop 
to  the  stage  at  which  the  seedling  produces 
true  leaves  and  establishes  as  a  young  plant. 
If  a  seed  is  subjected  to  the  conditions  re(cid:173)
quired  for germination,  and  it  fails  to  germin(cid:173)
ate,  despite  the  fact  that  it  is  alive,  then  the 
seed 
is  described  as  being  dormant  (see 
pages  28-9). 

Water  is  vital  to  allow  plant  growth  to  get 
under  way.  So, 
if  the  seed  has  not  been 
soaked  before sowing,  it  is  important that the 
compost  should  be  watered 
immediately 
after  sowing. 

Once  the  seed  has  sufficiently  imbibed, 
the embryo  inside the seed  begins to  produce 
root  and  stem  systems,  which  eventually 
break  out  of  the  seed. 

To grow,  the embryo  uses  its food  reserves. 

is  combined  with  carbohy(cid:173)

When  oxygen 
drates 
in  these  food  reserves,  the  energy 
necessary  for  growth  is  produced.  Thus  the 
germinating  seed  will  have  a  massive  oxygen 

requirement,  which  can  only  be  satisfied  by  a 
well-aerated environment within the compost. 
All  growth  processes  within  the  seed  are 
chemical  reactions  activated  by  the  addition 
of  water.  To  develop  successfully,  the  seed 
needs  an  increasing  quantity  of  water,  and 
the compost  must  be capable of  holding these 
amounts. 

reactions 

these  reactions  are 

As  all  the  processes  involved  are  basically 
chemical 
they  will  obey  normal 
physical  rules,  the  simplest  of  which  implies 
that  the  higher  the  temperature  is  raised,  the 
faster  will  be  the  rate  of  the  reaction. 
In 
practice,  this  means  that  the  warmer  seeds 
are  kept,  the  quicker  they  will  germinate.  As 
all 
in  a 
biological  context,  there  are  biological  limi(cid:173)
tations  as  to  how  high  the  temperature  can 
be  raised.  In  practice there are also  economic 
considerations,  because  high  temperatures 
are  costly  to  maintain.  Experience  suggests 
that  a  germination  temperature  of  2T^C/70Â°F 
is  a  reasonable  compromise  for  most  flower 
and  vegetable seeds,  and this  is why an  airing 
cabinet  is  an  excellent  place  for  seeds  to

germinate.  For  germination  of  tree  and  shrub 
seeds  see  page  35. 

To  keep  seeds  moist  and  warm,  cover  the 
container  with  a  sheet  of  glass  so  that  water 
condenses  on  the  glass  and  falls  back  into 
the  compost.  To  minimize  temperature  fluc(cid:173)
tuations  cover the glass with  a sheet  of  paper. 
As  soon  as  the  seedlings  emerge,  both 
paper  and  glass  should  be  removed.  Spray 
the  seedlings  regularly  with  water  and  place 
them  in  a  well-lit  area,  out  of  strong  direct 
sunlight  to  avoid  scorching.

If  the  seedlings  are  to  be  kept  in  their 
container for  some time they  should  be given 
a  liquid  fertilizer  diluted  according  to  manu(cid:173)

composts  contain  only  a  phosphate fertilizer.

tips  of  the  fingers.  Strike  off  compost  level 
with  the  rim.  Lightly  firm  with  presser  board 
so that the compost is 1/4-3/8in below the rim 
of the  container,  which  is  now  prepared. 

Water  the  seedlings;  then  loosen  them  by 

knocking  the  old  container  so  that  the  com(cid:173)

seedling  by  its  seed  leaf  and  gently  lift  with 
the  aid  of  a  dibble,  keeping  its  root  system 
intact.  Never  hold  the  seedling  by  its  stem. 

With  the  dibble,  make  a  hole  in  the  fresh 
compost  big  enough  to  take  the  roots.  Drop 
in  the  seedling  and  gently  firm  the  compost 
back  round  the  roots  with  the  dibble.  Repeat 
this  operation 
for  each  seedling,  spacing 
at  24-40  seedlings  per  tray.

Most  seedlings  will  have  been  germinated 
in  a  protected  environment  during  the  early 
part  of 
to  produce  a  plant  of 
sufficient  size  to  be  planted  out  as  soon  as 
the danger of frost is passed. Because so many 
seedlings  are  produced  in  the  early  part  of 
the year,  and  they  are  not  hardy,  and  in  most 
gardens there  is a  premium on  any  space that 
provides  sufficient  protection,  plants  tend  to 
be  grown  at  a  high  density. 

The  problem  with  crowding  plants together 
is  that  an  increase  in  fungal  diseases  both  on 
the  stems  and  leaves  and  in  the  compost  is 
likely  to  result;  the  plants  tend  to  become

in 
light 
intensity  is  usually  poor  and  growth  rates  of 
seedlings  will  be  proportionately  depressed. 
Sow  bedding  plant  seeds  in  a  pan  (dwarf 
pot)  or a  seed  tray  depending on the quantity 
of  seed  used.  Because  the  seeds  germinate 
relatively rapidly at warm temperatures,  peat-
based  composts  are  quite  satisfactory,  and 
there  are  many  proprietary  brands  available. 
Fill  the  container  with  compost,  but  keep  it 
light  and  uncompacted  so  that  drainage  is 
maintained.  The  main  problem  with  peat-
based  composts  is  that  they tend  to waterlog 
easily,  causing  both  death  of  the  seeds  and 
poor seedling developmentâ€”symptoms often 
associated  with  damping-off  diseases  and 
sciarid  fly  attacks. 

Many  bedding  plants,  for  example  lobelia 
incredibly 
and  Begonia  semperflorens,  have 
small, 
that  are 
almost  dustlike,  seeds 
difficult to  sow  evenly  and  at a sufficiently  low 
density.  These  should  be  thoroughly  mixed 
with  some  dry,  fine  sand,  so  that  an  even 
distribution  can  be  achieved.  Covering  with 
compost  is  not  then  necessary. 

With  the seed  packet close to the  container

Label  the container and water the seeds either 
by  using  a  fine  rose  on  a  watering  can  or  by 
standing  the  container  in  a  basin  of  water. 
Add  a  fungicide  such  as  Captan  to  the water. 
Cover  with  a  sheet  of  glass 
to  conserve 
moisture  and  place  in  a  warm  environment 
(21Â°C/70Â°F)  to  promote  germination;  at  this 
stage  light  is  not  important. 

As  soon  as  the  seedlings  emerge,  place 
them  in  the  light  to  encourage  growth  and 
remove the cover  because excessive humidity 
among  seedlings  at  this  stage  will  lead  to 
damping  off. 

The  temperature,  however,  should  still  be 
maintained  at  as  warm  a  level  as  possible  to 
encourage  quick  growth  to  a  size  at  which 
the  seedlings  can  be  pricked  out. 

As  soon  as  the  seedlings  are  large  enough 
to  handle,  prick  them  out  into  individual  pots 
or  seed  trays.  Their  growth  will  inevitably  be 
checked  when  they  are transplanted,  but  the 
smaller  and  less  branched  the  root  system  is, 
the  less  damage  and  therefore  check  will  be 
experienced. 

The  main  problem  will  be  the  likelihood  of 
damping-off  diseases.  This  can  only  be 
avoided  by  scrupulous  hygiene,  light  sowing 
densities  and  regular  sprays  with  fungicides 
such  as  Captan  or  copper-based  chemicals. 

The  growing  of  herbaceous  plants  from  seed 
is  by  no  means  as  widely  practiced  as  the 
growing  of  bedding  plants  or  even  alpines 
from  seed.  This 
largely  because  most 
herbaceous  plants  are  selected  forms  that 
require  vegetative  methods  of  propagation. 
However,  there  are  many  herbaceous  plants,

Most  hardy  herbaceous  plants,  and  es(cid:173)

in 
the  late  summer  and  autumn,  will  produce 
seeds  that  require  a  period  of  exposure to  the 
cold  to  break  their  dormancy.  Their  seed  is 
sown  in  autumn  or  winter  in  containers  that 
are  then  left  outdoors;  germination  should 
occur  in  the  spring. 

Those  plants  that  disperse  their  seeds  in 
summer,  after  an  early  spring flowering,  often 
do  not  show  any  dormancy  conditions, 
especially 
if  they  are  collected  and  sown

Seedlings  of  herbaceous  plants  are  sus(cid:173)

to  collect  his  own  seeds. 

it 

It  is  important  to  emphasize that  the  seeds 
used  for  propagation  will  only  produce  the 
kind  of  offspring  that  their  heredity  warrants. 
Seeds  collected  from  species  will  probably 
come true;  if collected from  selected varieties 
then  the  seedlings  will  normally  be  of  the 
species,  unless  of  hybrid  origin  (see  page  20). 
For this  reason  all  fruit trees,  which  are  highly 
specialized  forms,  should  not  be  propagated 
by  seed  but  must  be  increased  vegetatively. 
The  chief  problem  associated with  tree  and 
shrub  seeds  is  the  presence  of  various  kinds 
of dormancy,  which  in  the  extreme are some(cid:173)
times  combined  and  so  present  particular 
difficulties  in  getting  the  seeds  to  germinate. 

Tree  and  shrub  seeds  are  extraordinarily 
diverse  in  their  shape  and  sizeâ€”varying  from 
the  fine  dustlike  seeds  of  rhododendron  to 
the  large  nutlike  seeds  of  the  horse  chestnut 
or  the  oak,  from  the  flat  disks  of  wisteria  to 
the  hairy  "parachutes"  of  clematis.  All  these 
considerations have a bearing on an individual 
plant's  ability  to  survive  and  germinate:  large 
seeds with a large embryo should have a much 
greater  chance  of  successfully  germinating 
than  small  seeds,  as  they  have  a  larger  food 
reserve,  and  therefore  more  small  seeds  than 
large  seeds  need  to  be  collected. 

Also  affecting  the  quantity  of  seed  to  be 
collected  will  be  the  availability  of  seed  from 
year  to  year.  If  this  can  be  noted  on  a  regular 
basis,  it  may  give  a  guide  for  any  storage 
requirements. Beech is an extreme example as 
it  is  reputed  to  produce good  seed  only  once 
in  "seven  years";  other  plants  also  have 
definite  periodic  responses. 

The  gardener  can  either  purchase  his  tree 
and  shrub  seeds  from  a  reliable  seedsman  or 
he  can  visit  gardens,  parks  and  arboreta  in 
the  hope  of  coming  upon  some  unusual  tree 

or shrub producing a crop of seeds. Gardeners 
are  usually  very  generous  with  their  plants 
and, 
if  asked,  will  frequently  be  only  too 
willing  to  give  some  seeds  or  cuttings.

difficult  and  complex. 

In  woody  plants  there  are  three  different 

kinds  of  dormancy. 

The  simplest  is  that  caused  by  the  seed 
coat,  which  has 
thickened  and  hardened 
during the maturation of the seed. Its hardness 
stops  water  being  taken  up  by  the  seed; 
therefore 
imbibe  and 
germination  is  prevented.  In  nature,  this  kind 
of  dormancy  is  gradually  reduced  by  bacteria 
and  fungi  in  the  soil  decomposing  the  seed 
coat  until  it  is  no  longer  effective  and  water 
can  be  taken  up.

Dormancy  may  also  be  caused  by  an 
immature  embryo,  which  requires  a  warm 
temperature  in  which  to  develop  to  a  stage 
where  germination  can  proceed. 

The  commonest  form  of  dormancy  in  the 
seeds  of  plants  from  temperate  climates  is  a 
chemical  inhibition  to  the  embryo  develop(cid:173)
ment.  In  nature,  this  dormancy  is  broken  by 
normal  exposure  of  a  seed 
in  the  soil  to 
winter's  cold.  This  initiates  a  chain  of  events 

that  neutralizes  the  inhibitor  chemical  and 
so  allows  germination  to  proceed  as  soon  as 
environmental  conditions  are  suitable.

development  of  dormancy  by  collecting 
immature seed  and  preventing further drying. 
To  do  this,  collect  the  seed  when  it  is  green 
to  yellow  to  buff  colored,  and  fruit  as  it  just 
turns  yellow.  At  this  stage  the  seed  coat  and 
fruit  are  beginning  to  dry  out  and  so  develop 

into  the  condition  suitable  for  dispersal.  It 
would  appear  that  the  dormancy  controls 
develop  at  this  stage. 

By  collecting  the  seed  when  it  is  anatom(cid:173)

ically  complete  with  its  food  reserves  finished 
but  before  dormancy  becomes  built 
in, 
the  hard  seed  coat  is  avoided  and  the chilling 
requirement  is  at  a  minimum  (just  enough  to 
prevent  germination  until  the  spring).  Thus 
for  germination  to  occur  in  spring,  the  fruits 
of  Daphne  mezereum  should  be  collected 
not in  September but in  early June, when they 
are  small,  hard  and  green.  Complicated 
dormancy  patterns  which  take  a  long  time  to 
overcome  or 
require  a  complex  artificial 
procedure  can  then  be  avoided.  However,  it 
is  easy  to  gather  seed  that  is  too  immature, 
which  will  prove  disastrous. 

Once  dormancy  conditions  are  removed, 
the seed will  germinate,  provided that suitable 
conditions  are  maintained.  A  change  in  con(cid:173)
ditions,  such  as  excessive  heat  or  drying  or  a 
continued  shortage  of  oxygen,  will  cause  the 
development  of  secondary  dormancy,  which 
is  extremely  difficult  to  break  down. 

Buying seeds 
When  purchasing  tree  and  shrub  seeds  there 
are  few  regulations  which  ensure  the  same 
degree  of  certainty  in  production  that  can  be 
attributed 
to  vegetable  and  flower  seeds. 
Virtually  no  guarantees  are  available  because 
the seedsmen themselves have often collected 
the  seeds  from  the  wild  and  they  may  be  in(cid:173)

labeled.  Occasionally  seed 

Seed  collectors  and  wholesalers  usually 
process  seeds  by  drying  them.  This  has  t wo 
distinct  disadvantages.  First, 
the  drying 
processes enhance the  maturation  of the seed 
and  so  produce  deeper  dormancy  effects. 
Second,  for  those  seeds  that  store  their  food 
reserves as oils or fats, the drying degenerates 
the  food  reserves  and  so  produces  a  loss  of 
viability.  The  extent  to  which  viability  is  lost 
will  depend  on  how  much  food  is  stored  as 
oils  or  fats.  Most  nut  seeds  fall 
into  this 
category. 

Despite  these  drawbacks,  there  are  many 
seeds  offered  by  seedsmen  which  are  entirely 

reliable  and  which  are  capable  of  surviving 
the  drying  processes  without  any  detriment 
to  their  condition.  The  gardener  can  only 
learn  by  experience  how  drying  affects 
different  seeds.  In  many  cases  seedsmen  do 
not  even  bother  to  offer  seeds  where  there  is 
doubt  about  their  ability  to  survive the  drying 
process. 

Collecting  seeds 
The  collection  of seeds  from  trees  and  shrubs 
by  the  gardener  has  a  number  of  advantages 
over  buying  seeds. 

The  gardener  knows  the  identity  of  the 
plant  and  that  it  is  reasonably  hardy,  and 
he  can  have  a  clear  idea  of  what  conditions 
suit  a  particular  species,  having  seen 
it 
growing.  As  so  many  aliens  and  exotics  are 
of  doubtful  hardiness  this  is  a  worthwhile 
consideration,  especially  as  purchased  seeds 
probably  come 
from  a  more  southerly 
collection.  A  hardy  parent  does  not  necess(cid:173)
arily  produce  hardy  offspring,  but  it  is  more 
likely. 

Another advantage  is that the gardener can 
collect seeds at the moment he deems correct 

â€”a  situation  that  is  of  critical  importance 
when  green  seeds  are  being  collected 
to 
avoid  a  dormancy  condition. 

Seeds  that  have  been  collected,  processed 
and  sown  without  drying  will  not  suffer  losses

Seeds  that  are  green  or  bulky  should  not 
be collected  in  large batches or be kept  in the 
containers for too  long as they are very  prone 
to  "heat  up"  and  this  can  very  easily  cause 
the  embryo  to  die.  These  seeds  and  fruits 
should, therefore, be stored in small batches in 
polyethylene  bags  and  kept  cool  in  a  refrig(cid:173)

Large  cones  should  be  cut  one  at  a  time. 
When  collecting  seeds  it  is  useful  to  have 
both  hands  free,  especially  if  it  is  necessary 
to  stretch 
trees.  For  this  purpose  a 
collecting bag is invaluable. This can  be made 
very  simply  by  cutting  off  the  top  half  from  a 
plastic  fertilizer  or  compost  sack.  Tie  two 
pieces  of  string  to  the  upper  corners  of  the 
remaining  bottom  half  and  then  secure  this 
around  the  waist.  This  kind  of  collecting  bag 
is  far  superior  to  a  basket  or  bucket  as  it  is 
not  bulky  and  will  not  get  in  the  way.  Do  not 
substitute  a  burlap  sack  because  squashy 
and  fleshy fruits  may  soak  through  the  burlap 
into  the  gardener's  clothingâ€”an  unpleasant 
and  (literally)  irritating  experience.

Some  seeds  from  trees  and  shrubs  will  have 
to  be  separated  from  their  fruit  component 
in  order  to  facilitate  sowing  and  storage.  In 
certain  cases  it  is  also  necessary to  store  seed 
either  from  collection  to  sowing  or  from  year 
to  year.  Both  these  factors  have  a  bearing  on 
a  seed's  viability,  that  is  the  proportion  of  a 
seed  sample  which  is  alive  at  any  time. 

The  cleaning  and  extraction  of  seed  from 
the fruit is often a tedious and time-consuming 
business,  but  it  is  necessary  if  seed  is  to  be 
sown  evenly.

such  as  oaks,  chestnuts,  hazelnuts,  horse 
chestnuts  and  beech,  are  ready for  sowing.  It 
is  simply  a  matter  of  picking  them  up. 

Winged  fruits  should  be  dried  sufficiently 
to  separate  the  wings,  unless,  as  with  maple, 
each  wing  has  its  own  seed.  Where  the  wing

If the seeds are to be used within a couple

or  collected.  This  is  especially  relevant  for 
plants  that store  their food  as fats  and  oils. 
The  cooler the seeds  are  kept the  longer 
they  remain  alive  and  vigorous.  So,  for 
long-term  storage,  put 
in  a 
polyethylene  bag,  label  them,  and  then 
place  them  in  a  domestic  refrigerator  near 
the  spot  where  it  is  coolest.  The  lower  the 
temperature the  more  effective  is  storage, 
as  long  as the  seeds  are  not frozen.  Under 
these  conditions  seeds  can  be  stored  for 
several  weeks. 

the  seeds 

Scarification 
Before  sowing  it  is  necessary  to  break  the 
dormancy  of seeds with  hard  seed  coats,  and 
this  can  be  done  artificially  by  the  gardener 
so  that  germination  will  occur  as  soon  as 
conditions  are  suitable. 

Commercially,  the  dormancy  period  is  re(cid:173)
duced  by  adding, concentrated  acid  to  the 
seed  coat,  which  then  disintegrates.  Simpler 
and  safer  methods  are  to  be  preferred,  how(cid:173)
ever.  Seeds  of  a  sufficient  size  to  be  handled 
individually  can  be  chipped  by  cutting  a 
portion  of the  hard  seed  coat  away  to  expose 
the seed  itself.  It  is  not  necessary to  reduce or 
cut  away all  the seed  coat  but  merely to  allow 
enough  to  be  removed  so  that  water  can 
enter.  The  seed  will  then  swell  and  rupture 
the  remainder  of  the  hard  seed  coat. 

Smaller  seeds  and  seeds  with  coats  that 
do  not  lend  themselves  easily  to  chipping  can 

have their seed coats  reduced  by scarification. 
This  is  a  fairly  simple  process  in  which  the 
seeds  are  rubbed  with  an  abrasive  substance 
until  the  seed  coat  is  eventually  worn  down 
to  a  level  at  which  water  will  enter.  Possibly 
the  easiest  way to  scarify seeds  is to take a jar 
with  a  screw  lid  and  line  it  with  sandpaper. 
Place the seeds  in  the jar and then  shake until 
the  seed  coat  is  sufficiently  abraded  to  allow 
water  uptake. 

Often  a  seed  with  a  hard  seed  coat  also 
needs  to  be  chilled  to  break  dormancy.  In 
this  case  the  seed  is  subjected  to  a  warm 
temperature  to  reduce  the,seed  coat  before 
being  stratified  (see  page  33).  As  most  seeds 
are  shed  in  the autumn,  this  means that such 
seeds  should  be  stored  dry  over  winter  in  a 
warm  environment,  stratified  in  early summer 
and  chilled  during the following winter  before 
being  sown  in  the  spring. 

Stratification 
One  of  the  commonest  forms  of  dormancy 
found  in  seeds  of  trees,  shrubs  and  flowers 
from  the  temperate  regions  is  a  biochemical 
control  of  embryo  development,  which  has 
to  be  overcome  by  chilling. 

There  are  two  parts  to  this  process:  the 
imbibition  of  the  seed,  and  then  its  exposure 
to  a  period  of  cold.  The  simplest  way  to  deal 
with  the  problem  is  to  sow  these  seeds  in 
the  open  ground,  where  they  will  receive 
natural  chilling.  In  a  mild  winter,  however, 
there  will  be  insufficient  cold  to  overcome 
the  dormancy  controls,  and  so  germination 
will  be  delayed  for twelve  months following  a 
further  winter's  cold. 

Thus  to  be  sure  of  germination  an  artificial 
treatment  known  as  stratification  is  required 
to  complete  the  chilling  process. 

To  obtain  a  suitable  medium  for  stratifi(cid:173)

volumes  of  this  damp  peat  to  1  volume  of 
seeds  to  give  the  seeds  plenty  of  moisture.  If 
the  mixture  looks  compact,  add  1  volume  of 
grit  to  improve  aeration.  Place  the  mixture  in 
a  polyethylene  bag and  tie a  label  on  the  out(cid:173)
side.  Leave  for  two  or  three  days  in  warmth 
while  the  seeds  take  up  water  and  swell.  The 
seeds are  now  ready for chilling.  Place the  bag 
in  the  refrigerator  in  the  meat  drawer,  where

HOT  WATER  TREATMENT 
Some  seeds  with  hard  or  impermeable 
seed  coats  can  be  prepared  for  sowing  by 
treating  the  seeds  with  hot  water.  This 
extracts  sufficient 
"waterproofing"  and 
allows the  seed  to  take  up water and  swell. 
Using  a  ratio  of  3  volumes  water  to  1 
volume  seeds,  place the seeds  in a shallow 

dish  and  pour  water  that  has  just  gone  off 
the  boil  over  them.  Do  not  use  more  than 
this  ratio  of  water  otherwise  the  temper(cid:173)
ature  will  be  too  high  for too  long  and  this 
may  cause  damage  to  the  embryo.  Place

the  exercise.

The  preparation  of  the  seedbed  should  be 
carried  out  in  winter  so  that  the  soil  can  be 
left  rough  and  allowed  to  weather.  In  order 
to 
improve  drainage,  soil  conditions,  seed 
covering  and  ease  of  seedling  maintenance, 
the  level  of  the  seedbed  should  be  raised 
above  the  surrounding  soil.  Set  up  boards 
8-9 in high round the proposed seedbed. Keep 
the  width  of  the  seedbed  relatively  narrow 
(say  3 ft)  so  that  seeds  can  be  sown  evenly 
across  it. At this width,  covering the seeds and 
general  maintenance  is  much  easier. 

Thoroughly  dig  the  seedbed  with  a  spade

possible,  leaf  mould.  If  the  soil  is  particularly 
heavy,  also  add  grit.

In  spring,  knock  the  seedbed  down  to  a 
rough  tilth.  This  encourages  weed  seeds  to 
germinate.  These  can  then  be  sprayed  or 
hoed  off,  so  reducing  the  problem  of  weeds 
later  on.

fertilizer  at  the  rate  of  4 oz  to  the  square

facilitate sowing, and more especially seedbed 
watering.  It  also  makes  the  depth  of  seed 
cover  more  easy  to  assess. 

Ideal  sowing  conditions 
The  process  of  germination  in  tree  and  shrub 
seeds,  as  with  any  other  seeds,  should  be 
encouraged 
take  place  as  quickly  as 
possible  so  that  the  best  use  can  be  made  of 
the  available  food  reserves.  Thus,  tree  and 
shrub  seeds  should  be  sown  under  the  best 
possible  conditions  in  a well-drained,  aerated 

to 

seedbed  with  sufficient  supplies  of water  and 
a  warm  environment. 

Germination 

is  primarily  dependent  on 
water,  and  the  seed  must  swell  and  become 
completely  imbibed  before  biological  activity 
can  begin.  After  this  stage,  water  is  still  all-
important  as  it  forms  the  basis  of  all  living 
processes  causing germination.  The seedbed, 
however,  must  not  become  waterlogged.  Air, 
which  contains  oxygen, 
is  also  essential 
around  the  seed.  Energy  is  necessary  for 
growth,  and  it  is  produced  when  oxygen  is 
used  in  the  breakdown  of  the  carbohydrate 
reserves of the seed. Thus, if conditions reduce 
available  oxygen,  germination  is  retarded. 

The  other  major  factor  that  affects  ger(cid:173)

Sowing  densities 
Before  sowing,  it  is  necessary  to  discover  the 
correct  sowing  density 
to 
germinate  and  establish  as  healthy  plants.  It 
is  as  useless  to  sow  too  thinly  and  so  waste 
space  as  it  is  to  sow  too  thickly  and  have 
very  small,  useless  seedlings  that  are  liable 
to  damp  off.  A  desirable  population  will 
depend  on  the  particular  plant  grown  and 
its  vigor. 

Once the desired  seedling density  has  been 
decided,  this  figure  is  modified  by two factors 
which  will 
then  determine  the  number  of 
seeds  to  be  sown.  The  first  is  the  viability  of 

that  will  affect 

the  seedsâ€”that  is  the  number  of  seeds  that 
are alive and capable of producing new plants. 
Take  a  few  seeds  and,  if  possible,  cut  them 
open  to  see  what  percentage  are  viable.  The 
second  consideration 
the 
sowing  density  is  a  survival  factor.  As  it  is 
unlikely  that  all  the  live  seeds  will  germinate 
and  establish  as  seedlings,  an  estimate  must 
be  made  of  the  likely  losses,  which  may  be 
caused  by  poor  germination  conditions,  rots, 
pests  and  frost.  In  general,  the  larger  the 
seed  and 
the  shorter  the  period  between 
sowing  and  germination  the  greater  chance 
it  has  of  survival. 

Sowing  in  a seedbed 
Having arrived at a sowing rate and  preferably 
on  a  still  day,  sow the seeds  in  the fine tilth  of 
a  well-prepared  seedbed. 

Spot  sow  seeds  that  are  large  enough  to 
be  handled  individually,  spacing them  evenly. 
To  achieve  an  even  distribution  with  smaller 
seeds,  broadcast  sow  with  your  hand  held 
just  above  the  soil  level  so  that  bouncing  is 
minimized.  Once  the  seeds  are  sown,  firm

Finally,  level  the  grit  with  the  back  of  a

This  seedbed  with 

its  grit  covering  will 
maintain  the  seeds  for  an  extensive  period 
despite  exposure 
to  all  sorts  of  weather 
conditions. 

Protecting  the  seedlings 
When  seeds  germinate  they  will  be  exposed 
to  a  number  of  deleterious  influences  which 
may  reduce  growth  or  even  cause  death.  The 
chief  of these  ill-effects  is  wind,  which  causes 
stress

to 
compensate  for  water  lost.  Therefore,  shelter 
the  seeds  from  wind  by  putting  some  50 
percent  permeable  mesh  round  the  seedbed. 

in  seedlings, 

As  soon  as 

the  seedlings  emerge  and 
produce  green  leaves,  they  will  need  feeding 
with  nitrogen  and  potash  to  supplement  the 
phosphate  already  in  the  seedbed.  Although 
these  nutrients  can  be  supplied  by 
top-
dressing  with  a  granular  fertilizer,  it  is  better 
regularly  to  use  a  proprietary  brand  of  liquid 
fertilizer  at  the  recommended  rate,  applying 
a  small  amount  frequently. 

free  and  shrub  seedlings  are  extremely 
susceptible  to  damage  from  frost.  In  their 
natural  habitat  they  would  be  protected  by 
the  woodland  or  scrub  canopy,  but  in  the 
seedbed  they  are  completely  exposed.  Until 
the  danger  of  frost  damage  is  passed,  there(cid:173)
fore, 
they  must  be  protected  either  by 
stretching  netting with  very small  holes above 
the  seedlings  on  a semipermanent  basis  or  by 
spreading  newspaper  on  top  of  the  seedlings 
on  those  nights  when  frost  is  anticipated. 

In  addition,  it  is  vital  to  control  pests  and 
diseases  such  as  greenfly,  damping-off  fungi 
and  various  mildews  by  spraying  regularly 
with  fungicides  and  pesticides. 

If  the  seedbed  has  been  prepared  ade(cid:173)
quately then  few  weeds  should  be  present  in 
the  bed.  Windblown  weed  seeds,  however, 
will  appear  and  germinate  in  the  grit.  Pull 
these  out  while  they  are  still  small  and  their 
roots  are  in  the  grit  rather  than  the  soil. 

and  spring,  these  roots  will,  if  the  plant  is 
capable,  develop  suckers.  These  suckers,  if 
left  to  establish,  can  then  be  lifted  and  re(cid:173)

space,  the  former  technique  is  not  widely 
employed.

The  propagation  of  plants  from  roots  is  a 
simple  and  rapid  process  that  has  on  the 
whole  been  neglected. 

As  long  ago  as  1662,  John  Evelyn  wrote  in 
his  famous  book  Silva  of  the  possibility,  when 
a  tree  was  dug  up,  of  leaving  some  of  its 
roots  in  situ  to  develop  as  new  trees.  By  1731 
Philip  Miller, 
in  The  Gardener's  Dictionary, 
was  describing  the  propagation  of  certain 
trees  from  root  cuttings  as  an  established 
practice  amongst  gardeners.

appears to  have  been  ignored  largely  because 
of the  aura  of  uncertainty  associated  with  the 
success  of  this  technique.  Such  a  technique, 
however,  should  be  popular  because  large 
quantities  of  plants  can  be  produced  from  a

Initially,  it  is  important to  divide  plants  into 
two  categories: 
that  will  propagate 
from  roots;  and  those  (apparently)  that  will 
not.  A  plant  that  can  produce  adventitious 
shoot  buds  on  its  roots  should  be  suitable 
for  propagation  from  root  cuttings,  although 
ultimately this  is  not  necessarily  an  indication 
of  its  ability  to  regenerate  a  completely  new 
plant. 

When  the  various  plants  capable  of  pro(cid:173)

ducing  adventitious  buds  on  their  roots  are 
categorized,  it will  be seen that the  responses 
vary: some  plants produce buds on their roots 
as  a  natural  growth  process,  whereas  others 
require  some  other  agency  to  stimulate  bud 
initiation.  Some  of  them  have  buds

The  subject  of  " o n"  and  "off"  seasons

the  mid-twentieth  century.  However,

It  is  this  fluctuation 

in  the  capacity  to 
propagate  that  has  probably  produced  the 
uncertainty  which  has  led  to  the  propagation 
of  plants  from  root  cuttings  being  virtually 
ignored  by  nearly  all  gardeners. 

It 

is 

therefore  necessary 

to  determine 
whether  the  plant  from  which  root  cuttings 
are  required  does  have  different  seasonal 
responses,  and,  if  so,  what  is  the  best  time 
to  take  cuttings.

few  plants  can  produce  new  plants 
equally  well  at  any time  of the year,  but these 
are  relatively  uncommon.  Perhaps  the  best 
example  is  the  horseradish,  which  can  make 
itself  into  a  pernicious  weed  by  virtue  of  this 
characteristic:  when  the  roots  are  broken, 
it  is  capable  of  establishing  itself  as  a  new 
plant  from  each  root  piece. 

Virtually  all  other  plants  demonstrate  a

shown  that,  although  this  is  typically  true  for

the 
winter  but  the  dormant  season.  Many  her(cid:173)

to  succeed 

Although  propagation  from  root  cuttings 
likely 
throughout  a  plant's 
is 
dormant  season,  it  is  best to  keep  to the  mid-
part  of  that  season,  as  a  maximum  response 
may  not  exist  while  the  dormancy 
is  still 
developing  or  once  it  is  phasing  out. 

Preparing  the  plant 
Before  propagating  from  root  cuttings,  it  is 
preferable  to  prepare  the  parent  plant  itself 
so  that  it  will  develop  roots  that  will  have  a 
high  capacity  to  regenerate  stem  buds  and 
so  produce  new  plants. 

This  ability  to  produce  adventitious  stem 
buds  on  a  severed  root  is  already  present 
in  most  plants,  but  it  can  be  enhanced.  Lift 
a  healthy  plant  prior  to  the  growing  season 
and  shorten  any  top  growth.  Reduce  its  root 
system  by  cutting  off  the  roots  close  to  the 
crown  of the  plant,  using  a  knife.  Then  return 
the  plant  to  the  ground.  The  pruning  upsets 
the  natural  root/shoot  balance  of  the  plant, 
and  it  will  grow  quickly  during  the  following 
season  to  bring  the  plant  back  to  its  normal 

equilibrium  between  root  and  shoot.  As  a 
result  of  this  treatment  the  vigorous,  quickly 
grown  roots  will  exhibit  a  very  high  level  of 
ability  to  develop  stem  buds. 

The  roots  will  have  developed  fastest  at 
the  beginning  of  the  season,  and  the  rate 
will  gradually  have  declined  as  the  season 
progressed  until,  as 
the  dormant  season 
approached,  growth  will  have  ceased  alto(cid:173)
gether.  At  the  point  where  any  root  started 
its  growth  in  the  spring,  and  where  it  grew 
fastest,  will  also  be  where  it  has  the  greatest 
capacity  to  produce  buds;  in  other  words, 
there  is  a  direct  correlation  between  the  rate 
at  which  a  root  grows  and 
its  ability  to 
produce  stem  buds.  If,  therefore,  plenty  of 
root  material  is  available,  it  is  best  to  take  a 
root  cutting  only  from  the  top  of  the  root 
where  it  began  its  development  in  the  early 
spring. 

In  order  to  obtain  cutting  material,  lift  the 
parent  plant  and  shorten  any  top  growth. 
Wash  it free of soil  either in  a bucket of water, 
or  by  hosing  it  down.  It  is  then  possible  to 
distinguish the young roots which  are suitable 
for  propagation.  Cut these  close to  the  crown

to 

the  root. 

Discard  the  thin  root  end  by  slicing  with 
a sloping  cut.  Slice  off any fibrous  lateral  roots 
on  the  cutting  to  ease  handling  and  planting 
later  on. 

The  removal  of  roots  from  the  parent  plant 
for  propagation  will  have  had  the  additional 
effect  of  root  pruning  and  so  will  cause  the 
development  of  further  roots  for  propagation 
in  the  ensuing  propagating  season. 

Size  of  a  root  cutting 
The  size  of  a  root  cutting  may  not  be  critical 
if  only  one  cutting  is  made  from  each  root, 
but,  with  roots  that  regenerate  readily  and 
from  which  it  is  possible  to  make  more  than 
one  cutting, 
the  optimum  size  of  a  root 
cutting  becomes  very  important.  It  is  there(cid:173)

but  if  it  had  been  placed  in  a  propagator  in  a 
temperature  of  18Â°-24Â°C/65Â°-75Â°F,  it  might 
well  have  regenerated  in  about  four  weeks.

The size of the regenerative portion  needed, 
however,  will  remain  constant  whatever  the 
temperature  of the  propagating environment, 
so  a  rule  of  thumb  measurement  for  the  size 
of  a  root  cutting  is  based  on  the  variable 
factorâ€”temperature. 

As  a  plant's  roots  will  have  been  pruned 
a  year  before  the  cuttings  are 
taken,  all 
roots  will  show  one  year's  growth  and 
therefore  be  approximately  the  same  thick(cid:173)
ness.  Thus  the  cutting  length  is  unaffected. 

An  open-ground  cutting  should  be  at  least 
4 in  long  as  it  will  need  to  survive  for  some 
16  weeks.  A  cold 
frame/cold  greenhouse 
provides a warmer environment,  and  regener(cid:173)
ation  will  occur  in  about eight weeks and  so a 
smaller  survival  portion  is  required  and  the 
cuttings  need  only  be  just  over  2 in  long.  In 
a  warm  (18Â°-24Â°C/65Â°-75Â°F)  greenhouse  or 
propagator,  regeneration  time  is  reduced  to 
four  weeks,  halving  the  survival 
time  and 
the  required  food  reserve  once  again  so  that 
in  this  environment  root  cuttings  need  only 
be  about 1 in  long. 

Recognizing the top  of  a  root cutting 
When  propagating  plants  from  root  cuttings 
it  is  very  important  to  notice  the  "polarity" 
of the cuttingâ€”that  it  has a top  and  a  bottom 
and  therefore  a  "right  way  up."  Most  people 
suggest  that  root  cuttings  should  be  planted 
horizontally  because  the  cuttings  have  been 

made  in  such  a  way  that  the  top  and  bottom 
cannot  be  recognized,  and  there  is  no  other 
way  in  which  polarity  can  be  recognized 
because  roots  have  no  leaves  and  axillary 
buds.  However,  stem  cuttings are  not planted 
on  their  side,  so  it  is  unreasonable  to  expect 
root  cuttings 
in  what 
direction 
roots  subsequently  grow. 
Cuttings  planted  vertically  and  the  correct 
way  up  will  usually  develop  to  a  maximum 
level  provided  that  the  cuttings  were  taken 
from  a  healthy  plant  and  they  were  given 
suitable  conditions  (see  page  40).  Cuttings 
planted  on  their  side  rarely  achieve  more 
than  a  40  percent  success  rate. 

to  be,  no  matter 

their 

In  order  to  recognize  the  top  of  a  root 
(that  is,  the  end  nearest  the  crown  of  the 
plant)  so  it  can  be  planted  the  right  way  up, 
make  a  flat  cut  at  right  angles  to  the  root 
where  it  was  severed  from  its  parent;  at  the 
bottom  end  cut  away  the  thin  portion  using 
a  sloping  cut.  Always  cut  roots  in  this  way 
so,  whatever  subsequently  happens  to  the 
root  cutting,  it  will  be  possible  to  recognize 
its  correct  polarity  and  so  ensure  that  it  is 
planted  the  right  way  up.

Treatment 
After  all  the  initial  aspects  have  been  con(cid:173)

a  stem  bud  and  then  surviving  until  the  bud 
develops  and  establishes  as  a  new  plant.  At 
present  there  are  no  growth-promoting  sub(cid:173)
stances  available  for  root  cuttings,  so  that  it 
is  not  possible  to  enhance  bud  production 
in  this  way.  The  special  powders  produced 
for  inducing  roots  on  stems  should  not  be 
used  on  root  cuttings  as  they  will  actually 
depress  bud  production. 

The  best  way  to  protect  a  root  cutting  is 
to  treat  it  with  a  thin  powder film  of fungicide 
such  as  Captan.  The  root  cutting,  when 
planted,  will  be  more  or 
less  completely 
surrounded  by  soil  or  compost  and  as  such 
could  easily  become  waterlogged  and  so 
subject  to  all  sorts  of fungal  rots.  The  survival 
of  the  cutting  will  very  much  depend  on 
protecting  it  against  this  possibility. 

Place  the  cuttings  in  a  polyethylene  bag, 
add  some fungicidal  powder,  using about one 
teaspoonful  of  Captan 
for  every  100  1 in 

cuttings.  "Balloon"  the  bag  by  twisting  the 
top  and  then  shake  it  vigorously.  Once  the 
cuttings  are  coated  with  a  powder  film,  they 
are  ready  for  planting. 

It  will  be  apparent  why  it  is  important  to 
be  able  to  recognize  the  top  and  bottom  of 
the  cuttings  after  such  processing.

Planting 
Root cuttings  need to  be  planted  in a  medium 
that  will

drying  out,  allow  adequate  aeration  and, 
when 
regeneration  starts,  provide  basic 
nutrients.  All  these  features  can  be  found 
in  the  ground  outdoors  and  the  root  cuttings 
will  do  well  there  provided  that  the  soil  is 
reasonably  light  or  they  are  placed  under  a 
cold  frame  in  soil  to which  peat and  grit  have 
been  added.  However,  except  perhaps  for  a 
few  very  vigorous  herbaceous  perennials,  it 
is  more  convenient  to  plant  root  cuttings  in  a 
container  and  then  plant  them  out  just  as 
soon  as  they  are  established. 

Select  a  container  of  suitable  size  for  the 
number  of  root  cuttings  to  be  propagated, 
allowing 1-11/2 in for each cutting. For example, 
plant  seven  cuttings  in  a  31/2  in  pot.  Fill  the 

container  with  a  peat-based  compost  con(cid:173)
taining  loam,  which  will  act  as  a  buffer  to 
prevent  excessive  drying  and  will  maintain 
an  even 
level  of  nutrients.  Strike  off  the 
compost  with  a  presser  board  so  that  it  is 
level  with  the  rim.  Then  press  the  soil  down 
to  at  least f in  below  the  rim  of the  container. 
Make  a  hole  in  the  compost  with  a  dibble 
and  then  plant  the  root  cutting.  Place  the 
top  of  the  cutting  just  level  with  the  top  of 
the  compost.  Firm  back  the  compost  around 
the  cutting.  Space  the  remaining  root  cut(cid:173)
tings  evenly  round  the  container. 

into 

Cover  the  cuttings  with  grit.  Strike  off  with 
a  presser  board  until  the  grit  is  level  with  the 
rim  of  the  container.  This  weight  of  grit  tends 
to  compress  the  compost  slightly  so  causing 
the  tops  of  the  cuttings  to  be  pushed  farther 
up 
the  grit.  This  will  provide  almost 
perfect  aeration  for  the  bud  that  will  develop 
at  the  top  of  the  root  cutting.  Do  not  water. 
Label the container and stand it in an environ(cid:173)
ment  (propagator,  cold  frame,  etc.)  that  is 
appropriate  to  the  size  of  the  root  cutting 
(see  page  39). 

Some  plants,  for  example  Romneya  coulteri, 
do  not  like  being  dug  up  and  having  their 

roots  disturbed.  Therefore,  place  only  one  or 
two  of  their  root  cuttings  in  a  small  pot  and 
treat  as  one  plant,  disturbing  their  roots  as 
little  as  possible  when  transplanting  them 
once  they  are  established. 

Aftercare 
Keep  watering  to  a  minimum  to  maintain  a 
well-aerated  compost,  which  encourages  bud 
development  and  reduces  the  likelihood  of 
rotting.  In  fact  there  is  probably  no  need 
to  water  at  all 
if  the  root  cuttings  were 
initially  planted  in  a  reasonably  moist  com(cid:173)
post and a humid  environment  is  maintained. 
Very  often  when  the  bud  first  develops, 
it  produces  a  stem  and  green  leaves  but  no 
root system.  This will  grow later from the base 
of  the  new  stem.  Even  if  the  new  roots  do 
develop  from  the  cutting,  they  too  will  not 
appear  until  after  the  stem  and  green  leaves 
have  grown.  Do  not  water  until  the  roots 
appear  as  the  cutting  is  still  liable  to  rot. 

Place in a well-lit area once the stem appears. 
Harden  off  any  young  plants  propagated  in  a 
warm (2TC/70Â°F) environment before planting 
out  or  potting  up.  Apply  a  liquid  fertilizer, 
according  to  the  manufacturer's  instructions. 

Some  herbaceous  perennial  plants  die  back 
to a crown  of buds each  dormant  season,  and 
their  roots  are  modified  to  store  food.  These 
specialized  swollen  roots  are  described  as 
tuberous  roots.  They  can  be  distinguished 
from  modified  stems  by  their  structure  and 
from  root  cuttings  by  their  inability  to  pro(cid:173)
duce  adventitious  buds  on  isolated  roots  and 
so  grow  a  new  plant. 

There  are 

two  basic  kinds  of  tuberous 
roots:  those  that  develop  annually,  such  as 
on  dahlias,  and  those  that  are  perennial  and 
simply  increase  in  size,  such  as  on  begonias. 
Annual  tuberous  roots  develop  from  lateral 
roots  at  the  crown  of  the  plant.  During  the 
growing  season,  certain  of  these  develop  as 
food  stores,  swelling  up  and  producing  a 
cluster  of  such  roots.  Each  year  the  new 
shoot  system  develops  at  the  expense  of the 
food  store 
roots,  which 
eventually  die  and  disintegrate.

the 

tuberous 

Perennial  tuberous  roots  are  much  simpler 
in  their  development.  Usually  the  emerging 
radicle  of  the  seedling  begins  to  modify  as 
a  food  storage  organ,  and  this  increases  in 
size  as  and  when  food  is  available. 

The  division  of  tuberous  roots  is  not  a 
widely  used  technique  as  many  plants  with 
tuberous 
roots  can  be  propagated  more 
satisfactorily  by  stem, 
leaf  bud 
cuttings.  Success  depends  on  how  well  the 
roots  are  stored.  Lift  the  plant  at  the  end  of 
the  growing  season.  Clean  the  crowns  and 
dust  with  a  fungicide.  Wrap  each  plant  in 
thick  newspaper  and  place 
in  a  frost-free 
environment,  below  5Â°C/42Â°F.

Just  before  the  growing  season,  divide  the 
tuberous 
into  portions,  each  with 
at  least  one  crown  bud,  from  which  the  new 
stem  will  develop.  Protect  all  cut  surfaces 
from 
rotting  by  dusting  with  a  powder 
fungicide  such  as  Thiram  or  Captan.  Then 
place  the divisions  in  a warm  (21C/70"F),  dry, 
airy  area  for  a  couple  of  days  so  that  the  cut 
surfaces  seal  themselves  quickly  by  develop(cid:173)

A  modified  stem  is  an  organ  that  stores food, 
which  the  plant  can  then  use  to  survive  its 
dormancy  period.  Also,  it  is  often  the  means 
by which a plant can spread and  produce new 
plants. 

To  be  classed  among  this  group  a  modified 
stem  must  exhibit  all  the  characteristics  of 
a  stem.  It  must  have  a  stem  structure:  that 
is  it  will  have  an  apical  growing  point;  the 
stem 
in 
their  axils;  and  the  arrangement  of the  leaves 
will  be spiral, alternate or opposite each other.

itself  will  carry 

A  corm  is  the  swollen  base  of  a  solid  stem 
which  is  surrounded  by  scale  leaves.  These 
are  attached  to  the  stem  at  distinct  nodes 
which  have  a  bud  in  each  axil.  At  the  apex 
of  the  corm  is  a  bud  that  will  develop  into 
the  leaves  and  the  flowering  shoot. 

An  offset  is  a  lateral  shoot  that  develops 
from  a  leaf  axil  at  the  crown  of  a  plant.  This 
lateral  shoot  usually  has  only  one  bud,  which 
develops  into  a  plantlet  with  its  own  root  and 
growing  point. 

The  stem  is  modified  from  the  normal  in 
that  it  may  not  necessarily  be  above  ground, 
it  often  grows  more  or  less  horizontally,  and 
it  usually  acts  as  a  food  storage  organ. 

There  are  basically  only  six  kinds  of 
modified  stem,  all  with  distinct  habits  and 
growth  patterns.  These  are  tubers,  rhizomes, 
corms, bulbs, offsets and runners. They should 
not  be  confused  with  modified  root  systems, 
which  do  not  possess  all  the  features  asso(cid:173)
ciated  with  a  stem. 

A  tuber,  for  example,  has  "eyes,"  which 
have  a  cluster  of  buds  and  a  leaf  scar.  These 
are  the  nodes  of  a  typical  stem.  They  are 
arranged  in  a  spiral,  alternately  or  opposite 
each  other  beginning  from  the  apical  bud 
on  the  end  opposite the  scar where  the tuber 
was  attached  to  the  parent  plant. 

A  bulb,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  short, 
fleshy,  usually  vertical  stem  which,  at 
its 
apex,  has  a  growing  point  enclosed  by  thick, 
fleshy  scale  leaves.  New  bulbs  develop 
in 
the  axil  of  these  scale  leaves.  The  flower  bud 
and  foliage  leaves  grow  up  from  the  center 
of the  bulb. 

A  runner  also  develops  from  the  leaf  axil 
at  the  crown  of  a  plant.  It  grows  horizontally 
and, at several of its nodes, forms new plantlets 
from  the  lateral  buds.  These  new  plants  will 
develop  a  flowering  point  and  also  send  out 
their  own  runners  once they  have  established 
themselves. 

A  rhizome  is  a  specialized  stem  that  grows 
horizontally  just  below  the  ground  or  on  the 
surface.  The  stem  appears  segmented  as  it  is 
the 
composed  of  nodes  and 
leaves  and 
from 
apical  or  lateral  buds  on  the  stem.  Roots  and 
a  lateral  shoot  also  grow  from  these  points.

Although  potatoes  are  prolific  producers 
of  tubers,  this  is  unusual.  Normally,  plants 
that  develop  tubers  do  so  only  in  very  small 
numbers. 

Any  increase  in  numbers  must  be  achieved 
artificially.  As  the  tuber  is  normally  an  organ 
that  allows  a  plant  to  survive  its  dormant 
period,  the  season  to  propagate  tubers  by 
artificial  division  should  be  just  before  growth

Cut  the  tuber  with  a  sharp  knife  so  that 
each  piece  has  at  least  one  good  dominant

with  a  fungicide  such  as  Captan  to  reduce 
the  possibility  of  fungal  infection.  Stand  the

end,  where  it was  attached  to the  parent

A  rhizome  is  a  stem  that  grows  laterally  at 
or  above  the  soil  surface,  although  in  some 
plants  it  is  underground.  Normally,  a  rhizome 
stores  food,  but  the  degree  to  which  it  does 
this  varies  from  species  to  species. 

A  rhizome  is  a  perennial,  and  it  is  propa(cid:173)
gated  artificially  by  division  at  an  opportune 
season  of  the  year: 
in  most  cases  this  is 
after  flowering,  when  the  rhizome  is  about 
to  extend  and  produce  new  roots. 

It  has  two  ways  of growing.  In  one,  typified 
by the  German  or bearded  iris, a terminal  bud 
develops  and  flowers;  the  plant  sends  out 
extension  growth  through  a  lateral  bud.  The 
following  season,  this  extension  growth  de(cid:173)
velops  its  own  terminal  bud,  which  flowers, 
and  the  plant  continues  to  extend  through 
its  lateral  buds.  In  the  other  way  of  growing, 
typified  by mint and couch grass,  its extension 
growth  develops  continuously 
the 
terminal  bud  and  occasionally  from  a  lateral 
bud,  which  usually  produces  flower  spikes. 

from 

In  habit,  rhizomes  may  also  vary:  " c r o w n" 
rhizomes,  such  as  asparagus,  have  virtually 
no  extension  growth  annually  and  develop  as 
a  spreading  crown,  whereas  other  kinds  of 
rhizomes,  such  as  mint,  couch  grass  and 

crabgrass,  make

Perhaps  the  most  prolific  of  garden  plants 
to  be  propagated  using  rhizomes  are  bearded 
irises.  The  best  time  to  divide  their  rhizomes 
immediately 
and  establish  new  plants 
after  flowering,  when 
the  old  root  system 
dies  down  and  a  new  root  system  begins  to 
develop.  Lift  the  clump  of  rhizomes  with  a 
fork  and  knock  off  as  much  soil  as  possible. 
Cut  away  and  discard  any  old  rhizomes,  just 
leaving the current season's flushes of growth. 
Cut  back  their  roots  to  2-3 in,  and  shorten 
the  leaf  blades  to  reduce  water  loss  before 
the  new  root  systems  develop.  The  prepared 
rhizomes  are  now  ready  for  planting. 

As  a  general  rule,  a  rhizome  should  be 

replanted  at  the  same  depth  as  it  was  grow(cid:173)

Corms  look  very  similar  to  bulbs  and  are 
often  confused  with  them.  However,  struc(cid:173)

of  a  stem  that  is  swollen  as  a  food  store  and 
that  is  shorter  and  broader  than  a  bulb.  The

roots  are  produced  from  the  corm's  base, 
which  is  often  concave.  In  some  kinds  of 
corm,  several  buds at the top  of the stem  may 
grow  out  and  flower.

branous  and  give  the  bulb  good  protection 
against  drying  and 
injury.  The  roots  of  a 
tunicate  bulb  develop  at  the  beginning  of  its 
growing  season  on  the  outside  edge  of  the 
basal  plate. 

Bulblets  are  offsets  that  develop  on  some 
longiflorum  and  L 
level  either 

lilies,  such  as  Lilium 
bulbiferum, 
just  below  ground 
above  or  below  the  main  bulb. 

In  late  summer,  gently  detach  any  bulblets 
and  plant  the  bulb  and  bulblets  straight  into 
the  ground  at  twice  their  own  depth. 

Unfortunately,  only  a  few  species  naturally 
grow  bulblets  in  any  quantity,  although  some 
other  important  species,  such  as  L  auratum, 
L  speciosum  and  L  tigrinum,  do  produce  a 
small  number. 

Natural  bulb  reproduction 
Bulbs  propagate  naturally  by  division  and  for 
some  this  is  the  only  way  they  can  be  prop(cid:173)
agated.  In  the  annual  growth  cycle the  apical 
bud  develops  and  produces  a  new  bulb 
during  the  growing  season.  If  an  axillary  bud 
develops  into  an  active  growing  point,  then 
this  also  develops  as  a  bulb  that  may  take  a 
year  or  two  of  further  growth  before  it  sepa(cid:173)
rates  from  its  original  parent  (see  below)  and 

Scaly  bulbs 
Scaly  bulbs,  such  as  fritillaries,  nomocharis 
and  lilies  (see  below),  do  not  develop  a  dry, 
membranous  covering  and  are  very  much 
more  susceptible 
tunicate 
bulbs.  The  leaves  are  normally  scaly  and  very

As  soon  as  these  bulblets  appear,  remove 
the  scale  leaves  from  their  bag  and  plant 
them  vertically  in  John  Innes  No.  1  potting 
compost  or  equivalent  (see  page  12).  They 
can  either  be  planted  singly  in  a  3-31/2in  pot 
or  lined  out  into  a  deep  tray,  depending  on 
numbers.  Ensure  the  tips  of  the  scales  are 
just  visible  above  the  compost.  Cover  with 

grit  and  label.  Water  sparingly.  Keep  the  new 
plants in a warm (21" C/70"F), light environment. 
In  early spring the bulblets will  produce leaves 
above  the  compost.  In  summer,  harden  off 
the  plants. 

At  the  end  of  the  season,  when  the  leaves 
have  died  down,  lift  and  separate  the  new 
young  bulbs.  Replant  immediately. 

increase  a  particular  variety  of  bulb 

To 
rapidly  it  is  necessary  to  use  artificial  tech(cid:173)
niques,  because  the  natural  rate  of  increase, 
although  steady,  is  generally  slow. 

One  technique 

is  to  take  leaf  cuttings, 
although, with bulbs, these leaves are modified 
in  the  form  of  bulb  scales  and  the  technique 
is  known  as  bulb  scaling. 

Scaly  bulbs,  such  as  lilies  and  fritillaries, 
have  relatively  small,  narrow  scale 
leaves 
which  can  readily  be  pulled  off  the  basal 
plate  of  the  bulbs.  W h en  they  can  best  be 
propagated  depends  on  the  availability  of 
bulbs.  Ideally,  it  is  easier  to  deal  with  fresh 
bulbs,  and  these  are  normally  available  in 
October/November.  Imported  bulbs  are  not 
usually  available  until  January/March,  and 
these  will 
invariably  have  wilted  slightly, 
which  makes  them  less  than  ideal  as  propa(cid:173)
gating  material. 

Take  cuttings  from  a  fresh  bulb  in  a  turgid 

condition  by  pressing  the  scale  leaves  out(cid:173)
wards  until  they  snap  off  close  to  the  basal 
plate  of the  bulb.  With  a flaccid  bulb,  cut  the 
scale  leaves  as  close  to  the  basal  plate  as 
possible,  using  a  sharp  knife. 

To  propagate  from  one  bulb,  cut  off  only 
a  few  scale  leaves  from  the  outside  of  the 
bulb.  Some  bulbs,  for  example  lilies,  do  not 
like  being  lifted  and  replanted;  therefore  dig 

a  hole  around  the  bulb,  break  off  some  scales 
and  replace  the  soil  round  the  bulb. 

Any  scale  leaves  will  carry  potential  rotting 
agents  and  so  they  must  be  protected.  Place 
the  scales  in  a  polyethylene  bag  filled  with  a 
fungicidal  powder  such  as  Captan.  Shake 
the  bag  vigorously  until  the  scale  leaves  are 
completely  covered  with  a 
film  of 
fungicide. 

thin 

to  develop 

Mix  the  scale  leaves  with  four  times  their 
volume  of  an  extending  medium,  which  will 
allow  them 
in  a  damp,  well-
aerated  environment.  Various  materials,  such 
as  damp  vermiculite,  can  be  used  very 
successfully, but, provided that it is adequately 
sterile,  a  mixture  of  equal  proportions  of 
damp  peat  and  grit  is  just  as  suitable.  Place 
the mixture and a label  in a  polyethylene  bag. 
Blow  into  the  bag;  when  fully  expanded,  tie 
its  neck.  Store  in  a  warm  (21Â°C/70Â°F)  place, 
such  as  an  airing  cabinet,  so  that  new  plant(cid:173)
lets  can  develop. 

The  rate  at  which  regeneration  occurs  is 
related  chiefly  to  temperature,  but  is  also 
a  varietal  characteristicâ€”some  being  quicker 
to  propagate  than  others.  Generally  activity 
may  be  expected  in  about  six to  eight weeks. 
The  new  plant  will  initially  take  the  form 
of  a  bulblet  and  will  develop  on  the  broken 
surface  at  the  base  of  the  scale  leaf. 

Some  tunicate  bulbs,  such  as  hyacinth,  grow 
larger  each  year  and  propagate  very  slowly 
by  natural  division  of the  bulb.  They  therefore 
have  to  be  propagated  artificially  if  a  signifi(cid:173)
cant  increase  in  numbers  is  required. 

The  scale  leaves  of tunicate  bulbs  are  large 
and  encircle  the  bulb;  they  are  not  as  readily 
removed  from  the  basal  plate  as  the  leaves 
of  scaly  bulbs.  It 
is  therefore  necessary  to 
leave 
in  situ  while 
inducing  them  to  produce  plantlets.  There 
are  two  ways  of  doing  this:  scooping  and 
scoring. 

their  cut  scale 

leaves 

Scooping 
This  is  carried  out  toward  the  end  of  the 
bulb's  dormant  season.  To  scoop  the  bulb 
successfully,  and  with  minimum  damage, 
requires  a  special  tool:  an  old  teaspoon  with 
one  sharpened  edge  is  excellent.  Use  it  to 
in  one  scooping 
cut  out  the  basal  plate 
movement, 
the 
rest  of 
the  bulb 
undisturbed  and  the  cut  surfaces  of  all  the 
scale  leaves  exposed.  Although  it  is  possible 
to  do  this  with  a  knife,  it  is  inadvisable  as  the 
center  of  the  bulb  may  become  macerated 
and  subject  to  rotting.  Once  the  basal  plate 
has  been  removed,  dust  the  cut  scale  leaf 
surfaces  liberally  with  a  fungicidal  powder  to 
minimize  potential  rotting. 

leaving 

The  process 

follows  exactly 

the  same 
pattern  as  for  scooping  except  that,  instead 
of  cutting  away  the  basal  plate  of  the  bulb, 
the  basal  plate  is  scored  with  a  sharp  knife. 
Cut through  the  basal  plate of a tunicate  bulb 
until  the  scale  leaves  are  scored  to  a  depth 
of  about  1/4in.  Make 
four  equally  spaced 
scores  if  the  bulb  is  large;  on  smaller  bulbs 
two  scores  at  right  angles  will  suffice. 

Then  place  the  scored  bulb  in  a  warm 
(21C/70Â°F),  dry  environment  for  a  day;  this 
will  cause  the  cuts  to  open  out.  Dust  the  cut 
surface  with  a  fungicide  such  as  Captan. 
Subsequently,  the  treatment  is  the  same  as 
for  scooped  bulbs. 

The  bulblets  produced  in  this  way  usually 
only  require  a  further  two  or  three  years  to 
reach  flowering  size. 

Set  the  bulb  upside  down,  with  the  scale 
leaf  bases  exposed,  on  a wire tray  or  in  a tray 
containing  dry  sand.  Place  in  a  temperature 
of  at  least  21Â°C/70Â°F  to  encourage  calluses 
to  form  on  the  scale  leaf  bases  and  so  further 
combat  any  chance  of  infection.  At  the  same 
time,  the  bulb  should  be  kept  as  dry  as 
possible,  but  ensure  that  the  scale  leaves  do 
not  desiccate.  An  airing  cabinet  is  probably 
a  suitable  environment,  but  dampen 
the 
sand  occasionally. 

In  about  two  to  three  months  the  new 
bulblets  will  develop  on  the  cut  surfaces  of 
the  scale  leaves.  Plant  the  bulb  in  a  pot,  still 
placing  it  upside  down  so  that  the  bulblets 
are  just  below  the  surface  of  the  compost. 
Label  clearly.  Harden  off  and  then  leave  in  a 
cold  frame. 

In spring, the bulblets will grow and produce 

leaves  and  the  old  bulb  will  gradually  dis(cid:173)
integrate.  At  the  end  of  the  season  lift  and 
separate  the  bulblets,  and  replant.  They  will 
normally  take  a  further  three  or  four  years 
before flowering  size  is  reached. 

Scoring 
Flowering  bulbs  can  be  produced  in  a shorter 
time  by  using  a  similar 
technique  called 
scoring,  which  makes  fewer,  larger  bulblets 
as  there  are  less  cut  scale  leaf  surfaces. 

Dividing a plant is a common way to propagate 
many  herbaceous  perennials,  and  it  is  also 
used  to  rejuvenate  favorite  plants  and  keep 
them  in  a  vigorous  condition.  Propagation 
by division  is also successful  with shrubs,  such 
as  sumac,  that  produce  suckers;  with  semi-
woody  perennials,  such  as  New  Zealand  flax, 
that  produce  a  crown  of  offset  shoots;  and 
with  most  plants with  modified  stems,  such  as 
bearded  iris  (see  pages  42-9). 

the  central  part  of 

Herbaceous  plants  with  fibrous  crowns 
The  commonest  method  of  propagating 
plants  by  division  is  that  used  for  herbaceous 
perennials,  such  as  chrysanthemums,  with 
fibrous  roots  and  a  relatively  loose  crown. 
Normally, 
the  crown 
becomes  woody  over  the  course  of  two  or 
three  years.  As  this  woody  area  does  not 
produce  many  shoots  and  generally 
loses 
vigor,  it  is  discarded  and  the  remainder  of 
the  clump 
into  suitable-sized 
portions  for  planting  out  and  reestablishing 
a  new  crown. 

is  divided 

The  only  variable  feature  of  this  form  of 
propagation  is  the  time  at  which  division  is 
carried  out.  As  a  general 
the  most 

rule, 

time 

to  divide  such  plants 

opportune 
is 
directly  after  flowering,  as  this  is  when  the 
new vegetative shoots are being produced and 
the  new  root  system  is  developing.  In  very 
late-flowering  subjects, 
this  would  be  the 
following  spring. 

Lift  the  parent  plant  and  shake  off  as  much 
soil  as  possible.  Then  wash  the  crown  in  a 
bucket,  or  hose  it  clean  of  any  residual  soil. 
The  plant  can  be  divided  without  this  pre(cid:173)
liminary  preparation,  but  it  is  much  easier  to 
deal  with  clean  plants,  especially  if the  soil  is 
wet and  muddy.  Shorten  any tall  stems above 
the  ground  to  prevent  unnecessary  water 
loss,  especially  if  the  division  takes  place  in 
summer.  Break  off  a  piece  with  at  least  one 
good  "eye"  from  the  periphery  of  the  crown, 
where  the  young  shoots  are  generally  pro(cid:173)
duced; avoid the central woody crown, which 
is  of  no  value  and  should  be  discarded.  If the 
piece  proves  rather  intractable  to  remove, 
cut  it  off,  using  an  old  carving  knife  or  similar 
blade.  Plant  out  the  new  clump  as  quickly  as 
possible  to  the  same  depth  as  it  was  growing 
previously.  When 
it  should  be 
labelled  and  watered  inâ€”indeed  "puddled" 
in  would  be  more  appropriate.

Herbaceous  plants  with  fleshy  crowns 
Many  herbaceous  plants,  such  as  hostas, 
develop  a  compact,  fleshy  crown  that  is  not 
easy  to  pull  apart. 

The  best  way  to  propagate  these  plants 
is by  division  toward  the end of their  dormant 
season,  when  buds  will  begin  to  shoot,  in(cid:173)
dicating  the  most  vigorous  areas. 

Lift  the  parent  plant  and  shake  off  as  much 
soil  as  possible.  Wash  the  crown  thoroughly. 
With  a  convenient-sized  knife,  cut  the  crown 
into  pieces.  The  size  of  divisions  will  depend 
on  preference,  but  must  include  at  least  one 
developed  shoot.  Avoid  latent  buds,  which 
do  not  always  develop  satisfactorily.  Dust 
the  cut  surfaces  with  fungicidal  powder  to 
reduce  the  chances  of  fungal  rots.  Do  not 
allow 
really 
fleshy  rooted  plants  such  as  hostas,  to  dry 
excessively.  Therefore  replant  the  divisions 
either  in  the  ground  or  in  a  pot  as  quickly  as 
is feasible.  Label  them  clearly.

There  are a few woody  shrubs,  such  as  black(cid:173)

Lift  these  plants  in  the  dormant  season  and 
wash  thoroughly.  Divide  the  clump  of  stems 
into  convenient-sized  portions.  Normally  the 
main  core  of  the  clump  will  be  woody  and 
will  carry  few  roots.  This  will  be  of  little  value 
for  propagation,  purposes,  so  take  the  new 
pieces

Cut  back  the  branches  fairly  drastically  to

rootstock,  not 

Plants,  such  as  Michaelmas  daisies,  that 
produce  particularly  loose  crowns  can 
be  propagated  by  separating  off  single 
stems  on  the  periphery  of  the  crown  so 
that  each  has  an  adventitious 
root 
system.  These  single  stem  portions  are 
described  as  "Irishman's  cuttings,"  and 
they  should  be  planted  at  once. 

Offsets 
An  offset  is  a  plantlet  that  has  developed 
laterally  on  a  stem  either  above  or  below 
ground:  the  stem  arises  from  a  crown  bud 
and  usually  carries  no  other  buds. 

Most  plants,  such  as  sempervivums,  that 
produce  offsets  first  grow  a  miniature  plant 
with  only  minimal  roots.  A  root  system  will 
not  fully  develop  until 
late  in  the  growing 
season. 

To  speed  up  this  process  of  propagation, 
pull  away  the  offset  from  its  parent,  usually 
in  spring.  Either  plant  out  in  the  garden  or 
pot 
it  up,  using  a  cuttings  compost  with 
added  grit,  which  will  drain  freely  and  so 
ensure  good  root  development. 

Where  offset  development  is  poor,  it  is 
possible 
removing 
the  plant's  growing  tip.  This  has  the  same 
effect  as  removing  a  terminal  bud.

Although  the  term  offset  is  normally  used 
for  a  plantlet 
its 
parent  during  the  growing  season,  it  is  also 
used  to  describe  slower-developing  shoots 
that  are  produced  by  mainly  monocotyledo(cid:173)
nous  plants  such  as  yuccas.  Eventually  these 
shoots  should  be  sufficiently  mature  to  be 
separated  from  the  parent  and  planted  on. 

A  pineapple  plant  produces  offsets  that 
can  be  used  for  propagation  once  its  fruit  is 
nearly  mature.  These  offsets  are  variously 
described  as  slips,  ratoons  or  suckers.  Cut 
them  off  the  plant  close  to  the  crown  and 
plant  out. 

Many  corm  and  bulb  plants,  such  as 

fritillarias,  each year produce  miniature  repro(cid:173)
ductions  of  themselves  from  the  bases  of the 
newly  developing  corms  or  bulbs.  These  are 
known  as  cormels  (see  page  45)  and  bulbils 
and  bulblets  (see  page  47). 

Runners 
A  runner  is  a  more  or  less  horizontal  stem 
that  arises  from  a  crown  bud  and  creeps 
overground.  The  leaves  are  normally  scale(cid:173)
like,  and  rooting  may  occur at the  nodes.  The 
lateral  buds  develop  as  new  plants,  and 
eventually the  stem of the runner deteriorates,

example  of  this  kind  of  natural  vegetative

New  plantlets  usually 

produce  new  plants  quite  successfully.  How(cid:173)
ever,  unless  controlled,  a  mat  of  new  plants 
tends  to  develop,  and  these  are  not  easily 
lifted  and  separated  without  damage,  so  thin 
out  the  runners  regularly. 

To  produce

for  rooting;  in  early  summer,  thin  out  some 
of  the  runners,  and  pin  down  the  rest  into 
the  compost,  evenly  radiating  them  around 
the  plant.  This  method  will 
induce  early 
rooting,  but  the  rate  of  development  will 
not  be  quite  as  fast  as for  pot-grown  runners. 

These  are  obtained  by  placing  a  pot  under 
each  runner. 

Dig a hole in the ground beneath a develop(cid:173)

compost  into  it and then  push  back the soil  to 
keep the  pot in  position.  Pin  down the  runner, 
using  wire  bent  in  the  shape  of  a  staple,  so 
that  the  plantlet  will  root  in  the  pot. 

The  propagation  of  plants  from  stems  is  one 
of  the  most  widely  practiced  techniques  of 
vegetative  propagation. 

The  technique  involves  initiating,  develop(cid:173)
ing  and  establishing  a  root  system  on  a  stem 
either  before  or  after  that  stem  has  been 
removed  from  the  parent  plant,  and  this  can 
be done  in two ways:  by  layering and  by stem 
cuttings. 

With  layering,  the  stem  is  encouraged  to 
produce  roots  before  it  is  severed  from  the 
parent  plant. The  main  problem  is to establish 
the  rooted  layer  after  it  has  been  removed 
from  the  parent. 

With  stem  cuttings,  the  stem  is  removed 
from  the  parent  plant  before  it  is  encouraged 

it  is 
to  develop  roots.  With  this  method, 
difficult  to  keep  the  cutting  alive  until 
its 
roots  have  grown  and  established.  Its  ad(cid:173)
vantage  is  that,  usually,  it takes  up  much  less 
space  than  propagating  by  layering. 

Always  propagate  from  stems  that  have  a 
high  capacity to  produce  roots.  The  gardener 
must  learn  to  judge  this  capacity  in  plants, 
as  it  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  eventual 
success  of  the  layer  or  cutting. 

The  age  of the  parent  plant,  as  well  as  that 
of  the  actual  stem  to  be  propagated,  both 
have  major  influences  on  the  capacity  of  a 
stem  to  produce  roots.

is  asexually, 

seeds,  as  it  is  not  sexually  mature.  Therefore 
it  is  described  as  being juvenile,  and the only 
way 
from 
vegetative  parts.  Many  juvenile  plants  have 
a  very  high  capacity  to  regenerate  vegetat-
ively.  The  juvenile  stage  is  not  transient  but 
fixed 
in  some  ornamental  plants,  such  as 
some  varieties  of  ivy  {Hedera  helix)  and  the 
Lawson's  cypress  varieties 
'Ellwoodii'  and 
'Fletcheri,'  and  these  have  a  greater  capacity 
than  their  adult  varieties  to  produce  roots 
on  stems. 

Juvenile  plants,  however,  do  not  have 
much  value  in  the  garden  as  they  do  not 
flower  and  produce  seed.  Most  of  them  will 
eventually  mature  into  adult  plants,  when 
they  will  flower.  In  this  condition  a  plant  is 
sexually  mature,  capable  of  regenerating  by 
producing  seeds,  and  so  it  does  not  need  to 
reproduce  vegetatively. 

to 

regenerate 

A  plant's  capacity 

from 
vegetative  parts  declines  with  age.  Thus  the 
gardener  wishing  to  propagate  vegetatively 
from  a  mature  plant  encounters  a  problem. 
This  can  be  overcome  by  growing  a  mature 
plant  that  does  not  produce  flowers,  so  that 
its  capacity  to  regenerate  vegetatively  may 
be increased, and thus the rooting capacity of 
its  stems. 

To  prevent  the  plant,  or  at  least  the  stems 
used  for  propagation,  from  flowering,  prune 
them  rigorously  so  that  strong,  vegetative 
(that  is  nonflowering)  shoots  are  produced. 
The  harder  the  stems  are  pruned,  the  faster 
they will  grow  and  the  more they will  produce 
roots.  The  first  flush  of  growth  on  a  stem 
always  has  the  greatest  capacity  to  develop 
roots.  Really  fast  growth  is  achieved  by  a 
combination  of  hard  pruning  and  forcing  the 
plant  in  a  high  temperature,  at  least  16Â°C/ 
60"F.  Under  these  conditions,  roots  may  be 
induced  on  otherwise quite  intractable  stems. 
The  capacity  of  a  stem  to  root  will  also  be 
dependent  on  the  age  of  the  parent  plant. 
The  older  the  plant,  the  less  it  will  be  able  to 
produce  roots  on  stems,  even  if  the  stem  to 
be  propagated  has  been  severely  pruned.  If 
the  plant  has  been  grown  from  a  seed  by  the 
gardener,  then  he will  know  how  old  it  is,  and 
if  he  can  successfully  propagate  from  it. 

If  the  plant  to  be  propagated  has  been

Layering  is  one  of the  oldest  techniques  used 
by  gardeners  to  propagate  woody  plants.  A 
stem  is  encouraged  to  develop  roots  before 
it  is  removed  from  the  parent  plant.  This 
method  is  easy  as  it  avoids  any  complicated 
environmental  control  to  ensure  the  stem 
survives  while  the  root  system  is  developing. 
The  early  gardeners  had  probably  observed 
this  process when  it  occurred  naturally  under 
certain  conditions.  To  do  it  artificially  they 
just  repeated  the  conditions  and  modified 
the  technique. 

As  with  any  method  of  propagation,  it  is 
necessary  to  consider  both  the  stem  from 
which  the  layer  is  to  be  made  and  what  soil 
is  suitable  to  encourage  rooting. 

The  condition  of  the  stem  will  have  a 
significant  effect  on  the  eventual  success  of 
propagating  by  layering.  For greatest  success, 
the gardener should  develop  vigorous,  rapidly 
grown  stems  with 
their  high  capacity  -to 
produce  roots.  Certain  methods  of  layering, 
such  as  stooling,  encourage  this  capacity  in 
stems  as  part  of 
the  normal  system  of 
management,  but  in  others,  such  as  simple 
layering,  it  is  necessary  to  prepare  the  stems 
by  pruning 
the  parent  plant  well  before 
propagation  can  take  place.  When  pruning 
bear  in  mind  that,  with  most  methods  of 
layering,  the  branches  to  be  layered  will  have 
to  be  brought  down  to  ground  level. 

The  soil  around  the  parent  plant  will  also 
require  preparation  so  that  it  will  induce  the 
stem to form roots. Rooting will be encouraged 
primarily  by the  exclusion  of  light,  but  also  by 
the  availability  of  oxygen  and  the  presence 
of  sufficient  moisture  and  warmth.

The  exclusion  of  light  from  the  stem,  that 
is  blanching  it,  is  extremely  important  when 
encouraging 
to  start  growing.  The 
sooner  light  is  excluded  from  the  stem,  the 
more  effective 
the 
earlier  a  stem  is  buried  or  earthed  up  the 
more  likely  it  is  to  root.  This  effect  cannot 
be  overemphasized,  as  lateness  in  earthing

a  stem  fails  to  produce  roots,  provided  that 
it  is  basically  vigorous  and  capable  of  pro(cid:173)

The  soil  for  layering  must  have  a  good 
water-holding  capacity,  good  aeration  and 
adequate  drainage.  Thus,  especially  if  plants 

Layering  is  normally  done  in  late  winter/ 
early spring, as soon as the soil can  be worked 
down  to  a  tilth. 

As  the  technique  is  likely to  be  carried  out 
in  the  garden  and  not  in  a  purpose-prepared 
nursery  bed,  it  is  important  to  prepare  the 
soil  both  thoroughly  and  effectively.  Dig  as 
deeply  as  possible.  Then  add  peat  and  grit  in 
sufficient  quantities  to  convert  the  existing 
soil  into  a  rooting  medium  with  good  water-
holding capacity, good aeration and adequate 
drainage. 

Trim  a  rapidly  grown  stem  of  side-shoots 
and  leaves  for  about  4-24 in  behind  the  tip. 
Pull  the  stem  to  ground  level  and  mark  its 
position  on  the  soil  9 in  behind  its  tip.  Dig  a 
trench  from  that  point,  with  one  straight  side 
about  4-6 in  deep  and  the  other  sloping  up 
to  ground  level  near  the  parent  plant.

in  an  ordinary  garden 
border  as  opposed  to  a  purpose-developed 
layer  bed,  the  soil  must  be  dug  deeply  to 
provide  good  drainage  and  so  reduce  the 
chances  of  waterlogging.  It  can  be  further 
lightened  and  improved  by  the  addition  of 
peat  and/or  grit,  depending  on  the  heaviness 
of  the  soil. 

Warmth will  improve rooting, so ensure the 
layered  stem  and  soil  are  placed  where  they 
will 
receive  adequate  sunlight.  However, 
warmth  will  only  be  effective  if  the  soil  is 
moist,  so  water  the  layered  stems  during  dry 
periods. 

In  most  methods of layering,  the soil  should 
be  carefully  forked  away  from  the  layer  once 
it  has  rooted,  so  it  can  be  lifted.  Do  not  allow 
the  roots  to  dry  out,  otherwise  they  will  die. 

Layers 

that  may  have  difficulty  rooting 
successfully should  be well  established  before 
they  are  lifted.  To  encourage  this,  sever  the 
newly  rooted  layers  from  the  parent  plant 
about  three  to  four  weeks  prior  to  lifting  and 
replanting. 

This  weaning  can  be  further  enhanced  by 
pruning  the  stems  so  that  there  is  a  greater 
balance  of  root  to  stem. 

Simple  layering 
Simple  layering  is  perhaps  the  easiest  and 
most  effective  method  of  layering  a  wide 
variety  of woody  plants,  and  it  is  a  technique 
that  can  be  carried  out  with  minimum  dis(cid:173)
turbance  to  the  parent  plant. 

A  stem  is  buried  in  the  soil  behind  its  tip 
so  that  roots  are  induced  in  this  area.  Once 
the  root  system  is  established,  the  stem  can 
be  severed  from  the  parent.  The  roots  are 
encouraged  to  develop  because  the  plant 
foods  and  hormones  are  restricted  where  the 
stem  is buried. To  be successful, the gardener 
must  use  stems  that  have  a  high  capacity  to 
produce  roots,  and  they  should  also  be  near 
ground  level. 

Twelve  or  more  months  before  layering, 
rigorously  prune  a  low  branch  or  branches 
on  the  parent  plant  so  that  young,  rapidly 
grown  shoots  are  produced.  These  will  be 
more  amenable  to  the  bending  and  manipu(cid:173)
lation  involved  in  the  actual  layering  oper(cid:173)
ation,  and  because  of  their  rapid  growth  will 
have  the  required  capacity  to  produce  roots. 

Air  layering 
is  one  of  the  oldest  artificial 
techniques  of  vegetative  propagation.  More 
than  4,000  years  ago,  it  was  tried  in  China 
and,  because  of  its  continued  use  in  that 
country, 
traditionally  been  called 
Chinese layering.  It is also sometimes  referred 
to  as  marcottage from  the great  era  of  French 
gardening 
late  seventeenth  and 
eighteenth  centuries.

An  unpruned  stem  on  a  normally  growing 
woody  plant  is  induced  to  develop  roots  by 
restricting  the  stem  about  6-9 in  behind  its 
growing  tip  and  then  excluding  light.  This 
combination  will  cause  the  initiation  of  roots, 
and,  if  the  roots  are  surrounded  by  moist, 
warm  soil,  then  they  will  develop.  The  stem 
is  then  severed  from  the  parent  and  estab(cid:173)
lished  as  a  new  plant. 

As a technique,  air layering can  be  used  on 
a  wide  range  of  plants  that  have  woody 
stems,  and  it  is  a  useful  way  of  producing 
plants  without  specialized  equipment  or 
disturbing them  unduly.  It is carried  out either 
in spring on the matured wood of the previous 
season,  in which  case layering is close behind 
the  growing  point,  or  in  the  late  summer  on 
the  hardening shoots  of that  season's growth. 
Select  a  stem  of the  current  year's  growth. 
Trim  any  side-shoots  off  the  stem  for  about 
6-12 in  behind  the  tip. 

Prune  back  any  new  growth  on  the  rooted 
layer  toward  the  end  of  the  dormant  season. 
Then  cut  off  the  stem  with  shears  just  below 
the  point  of  layering  and  remove  the  black 
polyethylene  square. 

The  most  critical  stage  when  air  layering 
is  to  establish  the  rooted  layer  successfully. 
Fill  a  pot  with  John  Innes  No.  1  compost  or 

similar  (see  page  12).  Slightly  loosen  the  moss 
ball  and  roots.  Place  the  rooted  layer  in  the 
pot.  Firm  so the  roots  are  in  contact with  the 
compost.  Do  not  firm  too  heavily  and  so 
compress  the  moss  ball  and  roots.  Label  and 
place 
in  a  protected  environment  until 
further  root  growth  develops  and  the  new 
plant  is  established. 

Then  girdle  the  stem  (see  page  54)  so  that 
food  and  hormones  build  up  in  the  region 
where  rooting  is  requiredâ€”usually  about  9 in 
behind  the  tip.  Treat  the  stem  or  the  cut 
surfaces  with  hormone  powder  to  improve 
rooting. 

rooting  medium 

The  most  effective 

is 
sphagnum  moss  as  it  holds  water,  is  well 
aerated  and  is  readily  manipulated.  Soak  the 
moss  overnight  so  that  it  is  completely  moist. 
Take two  large  handfuls  of  moss  and  squeeze 
it,  then  work  it  into a  ball  so that  all  the fibers 
are interwoven. When it reaches about 21/2 in 
in  diameter,  split  it  in  half,  using  the  thumbs 
in  the  same  way  that  an  orange  is  divided. 
Place  the  two  halves  around  the  treated  area 
of  the  stem  and  knead  them  together  again 
so  that  the  moss  stays  firm. 

Hold  the  moss  in  place  with  a  square  of 
black  polyethylene,  and  secure  it  to  the  stem 
with  sticky  insulating  tape.  It  is  important  to 
ensure  that  moisture  cannot  run  down  into 
the  moss  and  so waterlog  it.  So,  turn the tape 
spirally  round  the  ends  of  the  polyethylene, 
overlapping  it  until  it  covers  part  of the  stem. 
The black  polyethylene will  retain  moisture, 
maintain  a  warm  environment,  exclude  light 
and  allow  gases  to  permeate  the  moss. 

The  layered  stem  will  usually  take  at  least 
a  growing  season  to  produce  adequate  roots. 

Tip  layering  is  a  specialized  technique  used 
for  the  various  members  of  the  genus  Rubus, 
such  as  blackberries  and  loganberries.  If  the 
growing  tip  of  such  a  plant  is  buried  in  the 
soil,  it  will  naturally  swell,  develop  roots  and 
establish  itself.  This  phenomenon  is  modified 
to  suit  the  gardener. 

Tip  layering  is  an  invaluable  technique  for 
propagating a few  plants,  as  it  can  be  carried 
out  in  the  garden  on  one  part  of  a  plant 
without  disturbing  the  flowering  or  fruiting 
ability  of  the  rest  of  it. 

The  members  of 

the  genus  Rubus,  es(cid:173)
pecially  the  fruiting  varieties,  are  prone  to 
virus  infections,  and  they  should  be  propa(cid:173)
gated  only  from  known  virus-free  stocks. 

Select  a  new  strong  stem  as  it  develops 
from  the  crown  of the  plant  during the spring. 
As soon  as  it  reaches 15-18 in  long,  pinch  out 
the  tip  to  encourage  branching.  The  growth 
of  these  stems  is  rapid  and  vigorous,  and 
soon  the  stems  can  be  pinched  out  again. 
Continue  to  do  this  until  midsummer,  when 
about  six

developed.

the  roots  of 

It  is  at  this  stage  that  the  stems  can  be 
layered.  However,  as 
these 
particular  plants  are  fine,  fibrous  and  easily 
damaged,  the  soil  for  layering  should  be  well 
prepared  so  that  once the  layers  have  rooted 
they  can  be  lifted  with  minimum  damage  to 
their  root  system. 

Dig  and  cultivate  the  soil  thoroughly,  if 
possible  dig  in  a  deep  layer  of  organic  matter 
to  conserve  moisture  and  prevent  the  roots 
drying.  Improve  the  top  6 in  by  adding  some 
peat  and  grit. 

Pull  down  a  stem  and  make  a  mark  where 
its  tip  touches  the  ground.  Start  digging  a 
trench  at  this  spot,  making  it  4 in  deep.  Give 
it  smoothed  vertical  sides  except  for  one 
which  should  be  sloped  toward  the  parent 
plant.  Smoothed  vertical  sides  will  help  any 
shoots  to  grow  vertically  and  so  produce  a 
manageable  plant. 

Place  the  tip  in  the  deepest  part  of  the 
trench  and  pin  it  down  with  a  heavy  wire 
staple.  Replace the  soil,  firm  and  water. 

In about three weeks, shoots should appear 

above  ground  level. 

In  September  cut  back  the  original  stem 
at  the  crown  of  the  parent  plant,  so  that  the 
layer  can  establish  as  an  independent  plant. 
Cut  off  the  rest  of  the  original  stem  and 
shorten 
the  growing  tip  before  lifting  the 
rooted  layer  in  autumn  after  leaf fall.  Replant 
the  layer  immediately  and  label  it. 

Protect any  layers that  cannot be  replanted 
straight  away  by  wrapping 
in 
damp  newspaper,  which  is  then  placed  in  a 
plastic  bag.  Close  the  bag  and  tie  the  neck 
tightly  so  the  roots  will,not  dry  out.

Propagation  by  tip  layering  in  this  way  can 

be  repeated  each  year. 

Stooling 
is  an  entirely  artificial  system  of 
propagating  plants  by  layering,  because  a 
plant  is  grown  just  to  develop  new  plants, 
which  it  will  do  year  after  year. 

It  is  a  technique  that  is  principally  used  to 
produce  specialized  rootstocks  that  control 
the  vigor  and  size  of  a  tree,  especially  fruit 
trees.  However  it  can  be  employed  on  any 
plant

Plant  a  rooted  layer,  cutting  or  seedling  in 
well-cultivated  ground  and  label  it.  Establish 
for  one  growing  season.  Never  use  a  plant 
that  has  been  grafted  as  it will  reproduce the 
rootstock  and  not  the  grafted  variety.  All 
clonal  fruit-tree  rootstocks  should  be  desig(cid:173)
nated  EMLA,  which  indicates  they  are  free 
from  virus  disease.  During  the  early  part  of 
the  dormant  season,  cut  back  the  rootstock, 
leaving about 1-2  in  of the stem  above ground 
level. 

In the following spring,  earth  up  any shoots 
as  soon  as  they  are  about  6 in  long,  so  that 
the  whole  plant  is  covered.  Work  the  soil 
down  between  the  shoots so that  each  shoot 
is  completely  surrounded  by  soil.  Do  not 
delay  earthing  up  as  one  of  the  most  critical 
factors  in  stooling  is  excluding  light  from  the 
plant  at  an  early  stage. 

As the shoots grow,  continue to earth them 
up  until  each  shoot  is  buried  to  about  9 in. 
No  further  action  will  now  be  necessary, 
unless  the  summer  is  particularly  dry,  when 
the  soil  should  be  watered  to  encourage  the 
roots  to  develop.  Just  keep  the  soil  around 
the  stems  warm  and  moist.  Too  much  water 
will  depress  temperatures. 

In  early  winter,  after  the  leaves  have  fallen 
and  the  shoots  are  fully  dormant,  gently  fork

After  removing  and  replanting  the  rooted 
layers,  cultivate the  soil  around  the  stool  and 
clean  off  any  residual  earth  on  the  stool 
itself so that it is fully exposed to the elements. 
This  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  buds 
receive  adequate  winter  chilling  and  will 
therefore  break  evenly  the  following  spring, 
when  the  whole  process  is  repeated,  except 
that  a  general  fertilizer  is  added  at  about 
4 oz to the square yard. Successful  production 
will  depend  on  looking  after  the  stool. 

French  layering  is  an  extension  of  stooling 
and, as such,  it also requires a specially grown 
plant  from  which  new  plants  can  develop. 
Like  stooling,  it  produces  an  annual  crop  of 
rooted  layers,  but  initially  it  takes  longer  for 
the  sequence  to  become  established. 

Cultivate  some  ground  by  digging  deeply 
and  adding  some  organic  matter,  peat  and 
grit.  Plant  a  rooted  layer  and  label  it.  Allow 
it  to  establish  for  a  growing  season.  During 
the  early  part  of  the  dormant  season,  cut  it 
back  to  1-2  in  above  ground  level. 

Leave the  plant to grow  undisturbed  during 

the  following  growing  season. 

After  the  leaves  have  dropped,  reduce  any 
shoots  to  a  manageable  numberâ€”say,  at  the 
most,  eight  strong  shoots.  Cut  back  their  tips 
so  that  each  stem  is  the  same  length;  then 
peg them  down  horizontally  over the ground. 
By  positioning  the  stems  horizontally  early  in 
the  winter,  the  buds  will  break  evenly  along 
the  entire  length  of  the  shoots  in  spring. 

In  spring,  unpeg  the  stems  when 

their 
shoots  are  about  2-3 in  long.  Cultivate  the 

ground.  Space  out  the  stems  evenly  in  a  star 
arrangement  around  the  stool,  and  make  a 
trench  2 in  deep  under each  stem.  Drop  each 
stem  into  its trench  and  cover  it  until  only the 
tips  of  the  new  shoots  are  exposed. 

Earth  up  the  new  shoots  as  they  grow, 
always  keeping  the  tips  exposed,  until  the 
mound is about 6 in above ground level. Water 
the  layers  only  if  the  weather  is  particularly 
dry.  Do  not  overwater. 

The  central  stool  meanwhile  will  be  pro(cid:173)

that  will  provide  the  next  year's  stems  for 
pegging  down. 

Gently  fork  away  the  soil  mounds,  after 
leaf fall.  Cut  away the  rooted  stems flush  with 
the  stool,  avoiding  the  current  year's  growth. 
Divide  each  stem  into  individual  plants  with 
their  own 
root  systems.  Plant 
these  out 
immediately;  label  and  water  in. 

Reduce  the  current  year's  growth  on  the 
stool  to,  say,  eight  strong  shoots,  and  prune 
to  an  equal  length.  Peg  these  down  on  the 
ground  so  that  the  sequence  can  continue. 

This technique is used to propagate numerous 
heaths  and  heathers,  dwarf  rhododendrons 
and  other  related  plants,  and  any  shrub  of 
suitable  habit  that  is  not  readily  propagated 
by  other  methods. 

A  plant that is already  mature,  and  possibly 
even  straggly,  is  dug  up  with  a  reasonably 
sized  root ball.  It  is then  completely  buried  so 
only  the  tips  of  the  branches  show.  These

strong-growing  stems  with  a  high  capacity  to 
produce  roots.  Older,  nonpruned  stems  will 
respond  less  satisfactorily  to  propagation  but 
will  nevertheless  usually  regenerate. 

Dropping  is  normally  done  in  spring  before 
growth  begins,  but  once  the  ground  is  no 
longer frozen,  so the soil  can  be broken  down 
to  a  tilth. 

WAYS  TO  BURY  A  PLANT 
Compress  the  branches  into  a  single  row 
towards  the  middle  of  the  plant 
if  the 
branching  is  sparse.  This  pattern  saves 
space  and  makes  weeding  easy.  It  should 
not  be  done  if  the  plant  produces  a  thick 
mass  of  stems  as 
rooting  will  not  be 
satisfactory  if  there  is  insufficient  room  for 
the  roots  to  develop. 

In  those  plants  with  brittle  branches, 
work  the  soil  down  among  them  so  that 
each  stem  is  surrounded.  This  pattern  is 
more  difficult  to  keep  weed  free. 

The  traditional  pattern  is  to  excavate  a 
bowl-shaped  hole  and  to  push  out  all  the 
branches  to  the  perimeter,  and  fill  in  the 
middle  of  the  hole  with  soil.  This  pattern 
is  easy  to  weed  but  is  wasteful  of  space. 

Cultivate  some  soil  and  incorporate  peat 
and  grit  if  the  soil 
is  heavy  and  likely  to 
become  waterlogged.  This  will  lighten  it  and 
improve  aeration. 

Excavate  a  hole  large  enough  for the whole 
plant to  be  "dropped"  into  it,  leaving only the 
tips  of  the  stems  visible.  Dig  the  base  of  the 
hole  well  to  allow  efficient  drainage,  other(cid:173)
wise  waterlogging  will  discourage  successful 
rooting. 

Lift  the  plant  with  as  complete  a  root  ball 
as  possible.  Place  it  in  the  hole  and  arrange 
its  branches  in  any  of three  different  patterns 
within  the  hole;  the  choice  will  depend  upon 
the  habit  of  the  plant  under  consideration. 

Whichever  pattern  of  dropping  is  used, 
ensure that  only 1 in  or so  of the stem  tips  are 
exposed:  greater  exposure  of  stem  will  cause 
the  new  growth  to  be  leggy.  Cover  the  plant 
with  soil,  firm  in  and  label.

Growing  plants  from  stem  cuttings  is  by  far 
the  most  popular  method  of  vegetative 
propagation.  However,  only  in  the  last  150 
years,  since the  availability  of cheap  materials 
and  the  development  of  greenhouses,  cold 
frames,  etc.,  has  it  played  a  significant  part  in 
vegetative  propagation. 

The  main  difficulty  about 

taking  stem 
cuttings  is  that  a  stem,  separated  from  its 
parent  plant,  has  to  survive  while  it  initiates 
and  develops  roots  and  establishes  itself  as  a 
new  plant.  This  distinguishes  the  technique 
from  layering (see  page 54),  in which  the stem 
is  not  separated  from  the  parent  plant  until 
after  a  new  root  system  is  produced. 

Because  a  stem  cutting  has  no  support 
system  from  the  parent  plant,  it  is  necessary 
for  the  gardener  to  supply  this  himself.  He 
should  ensure  that  the  propagating  environ(cid:173)

but  also  maintain

the  cutting  until

Selecting  a  suitable  stem 
The  ability  of  a  stem  to  produce  roots  will  be 
dependent  on  the  age  of the  parent  plant  and 
its  particular  variety,  and  on  the  stem  to  be 
propagated 
(see  page  53).  The  gardener 
should  try  to  propagate  from  a  plant  that 
has  recently  matured  and  is  a  relatively  new 
variety  rather  than  an  old  plant  or  old  variety 
of  plant. 

The  parent  plant  should  be  pruned  rigor(cid:173)

ously to  encourage  it to  produce fast-growing 
vegetative  shoots  from  which  stem  cuttings 
will  be  made,  as  these  shoots  are  most  likely 
to  produce  roots.  The  harder  the  plant  is 
pruned,  the  faster  will  be  the  new  growth. 
The  whole  success  of  propagation  by  stem 
cuttings  depends  on  the  ability  of  the  stem 
to  produce  rootsâ€”and  if  this  is  absent  or  at 
a  very  low  level,  then  the  stem  should  be 
discarded. 

A  stem's  ability  to  produce  roots  may  have 
seasonal fluctuations,  but this depends  on the 
condition  of  the  stem,  that  is  whether  it  is 
soft  wood,  hard  wood,  etc.  A  softwood 
cutting  is  taken  soon  after  the  buds  have 
started  growing  in  spring,  and  it  has a greater 
ability  to  produce  roots  than  a  hardwood 
cutting,  which  is  taken  at  the  end  of  the 
growing  season.  However,  because  the  soft(cid:173)

is  still 

immature, 

wood  stem 
is  more 
susceptible to water loss,  rot and  disease,  and 
it 
requires  a  highly  controlled 
environment  in  which  to  develop. 

therefore 

it 

A  stem  cutting's  food  reserve  is  used  not 
only  to  initiate  roots  but  also  to  maintain  the 
cutting  until  it  is  fully  established  as  a  new 
plant.  The  size  of the  reserve  depends  on  the 
condition  of  the  stem:  a  cutting  from  a 
mature  (hardwood)  stem  will  be  able 
to 
survive  much  longer  than  an  immature  (soft(cid:173)
wood)  cutting.  A  cutting  should  therefore  be 
encouraged  to  develop  roots  as  quickly  as 
possible  to  avoid  exhausting  its  food  reserve. 
It  should  also  be  exposed  as  little  as  possible 
to  variable  weather  conditions  to  prevent  it 
drying  outâ€”leafy  cuttings  being  particularly 
prone  to  water  loss. 

(for  example,  green  wood

readily,  without  the  artificial  aid  of  rooting 
hormones;  if  it  is  dipped  in  hormone,  the 
treatment  is  likely  to  have  little  or  no  effect. 
However  for  plants  that  are  difficult  to  root, 
dip  stem  cuttings  into  a  rooting  hormone,  or 
wound  them,  to  stimulate  the  roots.

Environmental  control 
The  rate  at  which  a  stem  cutting  develops 
its  roots  is  dependent  on  the  temperature 
around 
it.  The  processes  controlling  root 
initiation  are  essentially  chemical;  the  higher 
the 
the  chemical 
reaction  and  thus  root  production.  However, 
if  a  whole  cutting  is  kept  warm,  its  tip  will 
grow  and  food  will  be  diverted  from 
the 
important  function  of  forming  roots.  Its  food 
reserves  may  then  be  used  up  before  the 
cutting  has  become  self-supporting.  There(cid:173)
fore,  a  cutting  requires  two  temperatures:  a 
cool,  aerial  environment  to  keep  tip  growth 
to  a  minimum,  and  warmth  below  to  en(cid:173)

The  exact 

temperatures  vary  with 

the 
condition  of  the  stem  and  how  susceptible  it 
is  to  water  loss.  Softwood  cuttings  require

an  aerial  temperature  as  practicalâ€”a  mist

unit  is  ideal  Hardwood  cuttings,  on  the  other 
hand,  are  propagated  outdoors where the soil 
is  quite warm  enough  and  the  air,  even  when 
frosty,  is  not  too  cool.  Greenwood,  semiripe 
and  evergreen  cuttings  need  a  warm,  humid 
environment.  This  can  be  supplied  by  placing 
a  small  pot  filled  with  water  inside  a  pot  that

putting them  under a  polyethylene tent,  or  by 
placing  the  pot  that  has  the  cuttings  and 
compost  in  it  inside  a  larger  pot  filled  with 
moist  peat  and  putting  them  under  a  poly(cid:173)
ethylene  tent.  However,  the  main  disadvant(cid:173)
age of these two environments is that it is easy 
for  the  gardener  to  overwater  and  so  kill  the 
cuttings  through  rotting  and  fungal  diseases 
unless  extreme  care  is  taken.  Cold  frames, 
closed  cases  and  polyethylene  tunnels  are 
therefore  preferable.

require some degree of environmental control.

Leaf  bud  cuttings 
Leaf  bud  cuttings  can  be  taken  from  any  type 
of  stemâ€”soft  wood,  green  wood,  semiripe 
wood,  hard  wood  or  evergreen.  Each  cutting 
consists  of  a  leaf,  a  bud  in  its  leaf  axil  and  a 
very  short  piece  of  stem.  The  leaf  supplies 
food 
generative  processes;  the  bud  provides  the 
basis  for the  new  stem  system;  and  the  piece 
of  stem  is  where the  first  roots  are  produced. 
To  be  successful,  the  gardener  must  use 
stems  that  have  a  high  capacity  to  produce 
roots.  Therefore,  prune 
the  parent  plant 
rigorously  should  it  be  a  woody  plant.  This 
will  encourage  new  stems,  which  will  grow 
rapidly  and  so  have  a  high  rooting  potential. 
For  leaf  bud  cuttings,  select  one  of  these 
new  stems  with  an  undamaged  leaf  that  is

Make the  cuttings with  a  razor  blade,  knife

the  hardness  of 
the  stem.  Cut  close  above the  bud  so that  as

the  likelihood  of  rotting  and  die-back,  which 
might  endanger  the  bud. 

Make the basal cut about 1-11/2 in below the

Heel  cuttings 
The  taking  of  heel  cuttings  is  a  traditional 
way  to  propagate  plants  from  stem  cuttings. 
It  is a widely used  method of removing a stem 
cutting  from  a  plant,  and  it  is  quite  possible 
to  make  heel  cuttings  of  softwood,  green(cid:173)
wood,  semiripe,  hardwood  or  evergreen 
stems. 

A  young  side-shoot  is  stripped  away  from 
its  parent  stem  so  that  a  heel,  that  is  a  thin 
sliver  of  bark  and  wood  from  the  old  stem, 
also  comes  away  at  the  base  of  the  cutting. 
The  reason  for  taking  a  stem  cutting  with 
a  heel  is  to  give  the  cutting  a  firm  base  so 
that  it  is  well  protected  against  possible  rots. 
It  also  exposes 
the 
current  season's  growth,  which  has  a  very 
high  capacity  to  produce  roots.

Heel  cuttings  are  also  made  from  softwood 
and  greenwood  stems that  are  left to  develop 
in partially controlled environments, such as a

Mallet  cuttings 
Mallet  cuttings  have  a  hardwood  plug  at  the

propagated  in  the  autumn  and  planted  in

Mallet  cuttings  are  most  successfully  made 
from  stems  with  a  feathered  habit,  that  is 
from  a  stem  with  small  side-shoots.

ground.  Label  and  water  with  a fungicide. 

Soft  wood  is  the  most  immature  part  of  a 
stem,  and,  when  propagating,  it  is  the  most 
difficult  kind  of  cutting  to  keep  alive.  How(cid:173)
ever,  soft  wood  does  have 
the  highest 
capacity  of  all  kinds  of  stems  to  produce 
roots:  the  younger  and  the  more  immature 
the  cutting,  the  greater  will  be  its  ability  to 
develop  roots,  and  so  propagate successfully. 
Soft stem  growth  is  produced  continuously 
at  the  tip  of  any  stem  during  the  growing 
season.  As  it  matures,  the  stem  gradually 
hardens  and  becomes  woody.  The  faster  the 
growth  at  the  tip,  the  more  stem  without 
wood  will  be  present.

It  is  possible  to  obtain  softwood  cuttings 
later  in  the  season  by  forcing  the  plant,  that 
is  by  increasing  temperatures  well  above  the 
norm,  which  will  accelerate  growth.  This  can 
be  done,  for  example,  by  placing  deciduous 
outdoor  plants  in  the  warmth  of  a  green(cid:173)
house,  or  by  placing  houseplants 
in  a 
temperature  of  about  29Â°C/85Â°F.  The  very

Take  a  cutting  in  early  morning  when  the 
stem  is  fully  turgid.  By  midafternoon  normal 
water  loss  from  the  plant  will  exceed  uptake, 
and  the  plant  will  be  under  water  stress. 

If  the  stem  has  grown  less  than  4 in  since 
bud-break,  remove  it  with  a  heel,  that  is with 
the  swollen  portion  at  the  base  of  the  stem 
that  had  the  very  fastest  growth  when  the 
new  stem  started  to  develop  at  bud-break. 
Place the cutting in a  polyethylene bag or a 

bucket  of  water  immediately.  Keep  the  poly(cid:173)
ethylene  bag  shaded  to  avoid  "cooking"  the 
cuttingâ€”a  major  cause  of  failure. 

Plant  the  cutting  as  soon  as  possible.  If  it 
cannot  be  dealt  with  quickly,  keep  it  cool  in 
the  vegetable  compartment  of  a  domestic 
refrigerator,  where  the  low  temperature  will 
prevent  excessive  water  loss. 

If  there  is  more  than  4 in  between  the  tip 
and  the  base  of the  cutting,  place  the  cutting 
on  a  sheet  of  glass  and  make  a  nodal  c u tâ€” 
that  is  a  cut  at  the  base  of  the  stem  just 
(1/8 in) below a  bud  or leaf joint. This  provides 
as  hard  and  solid  a  surface  as  possible  and 
will  help  prevent  rotting. 

If the  cutting was taken  with a  heel,  neaten 
the  tail  that  will  also  have  come  away  with 
the  stem. 

Remove  the  leaves  on  the  bottom  third  of

Softwood  cuttings,  because  they  are  the 
immature  part  of  a  plant,  are  susceptible  to 
all  the  vagaries  of  their  environment:  so  the 

longer  they  take  to  root,  the  greater  are  the 
chances of them  succumbing to some outside 
influence.  Thus  the  speed  with  which  they 
regenerate is vital. The rate of root production 
will  be  dependent  on  the  temperature  sur(cid:173)
rounding the  base  of the  cuttings;  in  general, 
the  higher  the  temperature,  the  faster  the 
roots  are  produced.  Best  rooting  will  occur 
with  a  temperature  around  the  base  of  the 
cuttings  of  21-24Â°C/70-75Â°F. 

Spray  softwood  cuttings  with  a

The  essential  but  subtle  distinction  between 
softwood  cuttings  and  greenwood  cuttings  is 
their  speed  of  growth.  Externally  they  may 
appear  to  be  very  similar,  but  greenwood 
cuttings  are  taken  from  the  soft  tip  of  the 
stem  after  the  spring  flush  of  growth  has 
slowed down. The stem is, then, slightly harder 
and  woodier 
for  softwood  cuttings 
because the  tip  is  not  growing  away  from  the 
hardening stem  so fast  as  it was  in  the  spring. 
In  fact,  as  the  season  progresses  greenwood 
cuttings  become  harder  and  harder.  How(cid:173)
ever,  it should  be emphasized that greenwood 
cuttings  require  just  as  much  environmental 
control  as  softwood  cuttings. 

than 

Use  greenwood  cuttings  to  propagate  a 
wide  range  of  trees  and  shrubs,  such  as 
gooseberries,  that  will  root  easily,  and  the 
majority  of  herbaceous  plants,  such  as 
chrysanthemums.  However,  plants  that  are 
difficult  to  root  should  be  propagated  from 
softwood  cuttings  and  not  from  greenwood 
cuttings,  which  have a  slightly  reduced  ability 
to  develop  roots.

needed for root production, as the cutting has 
little  or  no  food  reserves. 

Rooting  should  take  between  three  and 
eight  weeks.  Take  the  rooted  cutting  out  of 

the  propagating  environment  but  keep  it  well 
protected,  gradually  hardening  it  off.  Then 
repot  in  John  Innes  No.  1  compost  or  similar 
(see  page  12),  and  label  clearly. 

Take  cuttings  from  these  stems  once  their 
growth  rate  has  begun  to  decline,  which  will 
usually  be  about  the  beginning  of  June  for 
most  outdoor  plants. 

Fill  a  container  with  cuttings  compost  and

Take a  cutting from  a fully turgid  stem  with 
all  its  current  season's  growth,  early  in  the 
morning.  Place  the  cutting  immediately  in  a 
bucket  of  water  or  a  polyethylene  bag  in  a 
shaded position, because it is vitally important 
to  maintain 
the  turgidity  of  a  greenwood 
cutting.  If  it  suffers  water  loss,  its  rooting  will 
be  hindered. 

Place  the  cutting  on  a  pane  of  glass  and 
with  a  knife  reduce  the  cutting  to  about  3-4 
in. The cutting's length will very much depend 
on 
the  amount  of  soft  growth  available. 
Discard  the  leaves  from  the  bottom  half  of 
the  cutting.  Dip  the  base  of  the  cutting  in  a

Make  a  hole  in  the  compost  and  plant  the 
cutting  up  to  the  leaves.  Label  it  and  water 
with  a  fungicide.  Place  in  a  closed  case,  mist

water  loss  and  wilting.  Ensure  the  cutting

During  the  late  summer,  annual  stem  growth 
slows  down  and  plant  stems  become  harder. 
Cuttings  taken  at  this  time  are  called  semi-
ripe  cuttings.  As  they  are  thicker  and, harder 
than  softwood  cuttings, 
they  are  more 
capable  of  survival.  However  they  are  still 
susceptible  to  the  same  problems  of  water 
loss  because  the  cuttings  carry  leaves.

Many  deciduous  plants,  such  as  deutzias,

for  propagation 

Prune  the  parent  plant  at  the  start  of  the 
dormant  season,  so  that  strong,  fast-grown 
stems  are  available 
the 
following  season.  These  will  have  a  greater 
ability to  produce  roots than  unpruned  stems. 
Prepare the soil  in the cold frame  by digging 
deeply.  Add  peat and  grit to  improve drainage 
and 
its  water-holding  capacity.  Cover  the 
surface with a 1 in  layer  of fine (builder's)  sand 
to  make  a  better  rooting  medium.  If  only  a

with  cuttings  compost  and  cover  with  a  1  in

Remove  the  tip  of  the  stem  if  it  is  soft,  but 
leave  it  if  the  apical  bud  has  set  and  growth 
has  ceased  for  the  year.  Shorten  the  cutting 
with  shears  to  4-6 in  long,  depending  on  the 
vigor  of  the  particular  plant. 

Cut  off the  lower  leaves flush  with  the  stem

Treat  the  basal  cut  surface  with  a  rooting

cold 
deep,  so  its  base just enters the soil  below the 
sand  layer.  Space  the  cuttings  as  close  as  is 
feasible,  but  this  is  not  likely  to  be  much  less

As  semiripe  cuttings  are  usually  deciduous, 
they  will  drop  their  leaves  in  autumn.  At  this 
stage  remove  all  the  fallen  leaves  from  the 
frame  so  that  they  do  not  rot  and  cause 
disease. 

The  propagation  of  evergreen 
trees  and 
shrubs from  stem  cuttings  is a traditional  and 
valuable  method.  Evergreen  cuttings  are 
taken  from  stems  of  very  ripe  wood,  that  is, 
almost  hard  wood.  They  cannot  be  regarded 
as  hardwood  cuttings  as  they  are  not  leafless 
and  are  not  fully  dormant  because  of  their 
evergreen  habit.  Because  they  have  leaves, 
they  need  sufficient  environmental  control 
to  prevent  excessive  water  loss. 

In  winter,  prune  the  parent  plant  from 
which  the  cuttings  are  to  be  made.  This  will 
encourage 
strong, 
vigorous,  fast-grown  shoots  that  have  the 
required  high  capacity  to  produce  roots.

take  place  during  winter.  However, 
evergreen  plants  can  be  propagated  from 
softer  wood  earlier  in  the  growing  season. 
Treat  these  cuttings  according  to  the  con(cid:173)
dition  (soft  wood,  green  wood  or  semiripe 
wood)  of  their  stems. 

Prepare  the  soil  in  a  cold  frame  by  digging 
thoroughly  and  mixing  in  grit,  peat  and  sand. 
Evergreen  cuttings  taken  in  late  summer 
should  be  4-6 in  long,  although  their  length 
must  be  related  to  the  normal  size  of  the 
plant  and 
the  amount  of  annual  growth. 
Cuttings  from  dwarf  Hebe,  for  example,  may 
be  only  11/2  in  long.  Take  a  heel  with  the 
cutting  (see  page  63)  if  it  is  to  be  propagated 
in  unsterilized  soil  in  a  cold  frame  or  poly(cid:173)
ethylene  tunnel.  Neaten  any  tail  on  the  heel. 
Leave  on  the  cutting  any  terminal  bud  that 
may  have  set.  If,  however,  growth  is  con(cid:173)
tinuing,  cut  out  the  soft  tip  with  a  knife. 

Strip  any  leaves  off the  bottom  third  to  half 
of the  cutting.  Make a shallow vertical  wound 
about  1 in  long  in  the  bottom  of  the  stem  of 
plants,  such  as  Daphne,  Elaeagnus  and 
Magnolia  grandiflora,  that  are  difficult  to  root. 
Dip  the  base  of  the  cutting  in  a  rooting 
hormone  powder  of  ripewood  strength  (0.8 
percent  IBA).  Ensure  the  wound  is  covered 
with  the  powder. 

To  make  more  economical  use  of  space, 
reduce  the  size  of  large  leaves  by  cutting  off 
up  to  half  of  each  leaf  blade  with  a  sharp  pair 
of  scissor-type  shears. 

Make  a  hole  with  a  dibble  in  the  prepared 
soil  in  the  cold  frame  and  plant  the  cutting 

up  to  its  leaves.  Allow  the  leaves  of  cuttings 
to  touch  but  not  to  overlap.  If  leaves  overlap 
excessively  they  tend  to  stick  together  with 
a  water  film,  and  this  provides  an  ideal  place 
for  rot  to  develop. 

Label  the  cuttings  and  water  them  with  a 
dilute  solution  of  fungicide.  Close  the  lid  of 
the  cold  frame  as  tightly  as  possible.  Shade

Leave  the  cuttings  in  situ  for  the  whole 
growing season. Transplant in  autumn, taking 
considerable  care when  lifting the  cuttings  as 
many  evergreen  plants  produce  fairly  thick, 
fleshy  and  brittle  roots.  Label  the  new  plants

As  with  virtually  all  methods  of  vegetative 
propagation, 
the 
parent  plant,  by  pruning  rigorously,a  year 
before  the  cutting  is  to  be  taken,  that  is 
possibly  the  single  most  important  factor  in 
the  ultimate  success  of  rooting  a  hardwood 
cutting. Hard, rigorous pruning will encourage 
stems  with  a  high  capability  of  producing 
roots. 

Where  and  when  to take  a  cutting 
A  stem  grows  at  different  speeds  throughout 
the  season.  It  develops  fastest  in  spring,  its 

rate  slowly  declining  until  autumn,  when 
growth  ceases  altogether.  Even  by  the  end 
of  the  growing  season,  the  base  of  a  stem 
that  was  produced 
in  spring  still  has  the 
greatest ability to develop  roots,  and  it should 
be  used  for  most  hardwood  cuttings. 

Plants,  such  as  willows,  poplars  and  cur(cid:173)
rants,  that  root  easily  show  very  little  decline 
in  their  ability  to  produce  roots  anywhere 
along  the  stem  and  so  virtually  any  part  of 
the  stem  can  be  made  into  cuttings. 

With  plants,  such  as  colored-leaf  plums, 
that  are  difficult  to  root  include  the  swollen 
base  in  the  cutting,  which  should  be  cut flush 
with  the  stem  (see  page  9). 

Hardwood  cuttings  can  be  taken  any  time 
during  the  dormant  season,  but  they  will  be 
most  successful  at  "leaf  fall"  and  just  before 
the  leaf  buds  break;  their  lowest  capacity  to 
root  is  in  the  early  new  year. 

Cuttings  made 

just  before  the  dormant 
buds  break  will  need  a  protected  environ(cid:173)

ment,  such  as  a  cold  frame,  or  very  careful 
timing to  avoid  leaves  being  produced  before 
roots,  so  causing the cutting to  lose water too 
quickly and  die. Thus  it  is more satisfactory to 
take  cuttings  at  "leaf  fall,"  when  they  can  be 
planted  in  the  open  ground. 

Conventional  "leaf  fall"  occurs  when  the 
stem,  having  produced  a  corky  abscission 
layer  to  isolate  each  leaf,  has  its  leaves  re(cid:173)
moved  by  rain,  frost  or wind.  However,  as far 
as the  plant  is concerned,  a leaf is  isolated  as 
soon  as  the  corky  abscission  layer  is  com(cid:173)
plete,  and  this  in  effect  is  "leaf fall." 

Run  a  hand  down  the stem  of a  plant.  If the 
leaves  fall  off,  the  corky  abscission  layer  is 
complete,  and  the  time,  therefore,  is  right  to 
take  hardwood  cuttings. 

Size  of  a  hardwood  cutting 
Although  traditionally  hardwood  cuttings  are 
made  between  10-14 in  long,  a  shorter  length 
is  much  more  successful. 

it 

is  vital 

Hardwood  cuttings,  although  leafless,  will 
still 
lose  some  water  by  evaporation  from 
their  surface.  The  commonest  reason  why 
these  cuttings  may  fail  to  develop  roots  is 
because they  are allowed  to  dry out. To  avoid 
water  loss,  expose  as  little  of  the  cutting  as 
possible  above  the  ground.  However,  if  the 
cutting  is  planted  too  deep,  the  buds  will  not 
grow  properly.  Thus 
to  expose 
sufficient  of  the  cutting  above  ground  for 
about  three  buds  to  develop.  In  practice  the 
third  bud  can  be  planted  just  below  ground 
level  as  at  that  depth  its  growth  will  not  be 
inhibited.  Therefore,  for  most  plants,  only 
1 in or so of the cutting need be above ground. 
A cutting initially develops  roots  both along 
the  stem  and  from  the  cut  area  at  its  base. 
Gradually,  the  roots  along the  stem  disappear 
and the root system  of the  new plant develops 
from  the  basal  roots  alone.  Therefore  these 
basal  roots should  be encouraged  by applying 
a  rooting  hormone  to  the  cutting  and  by 

maintaining  good  aeration  around 
it.  The 
surface  layers  of the soil,  that  is  about  the top 
2 in,  have  most  air  in  them.  Thus  ideally  a 
cutting should  be  planted  within  these  layers. 
However,  a  cutting  planted  2 in  deep  with 
about  1 in  exposed  above  ground  will  be  too 
short  for  survival:  the  cutting  will  dry  out  too 
easily;  it  will  be  too  short  to  anchor  rigidly; 
and  it  will  be  too  small  to  contain  sufficient 
food 
the 
dormant  season.  Thus  the  length  must  be 
increased  to  take  account  of  these  factors,

Propagating  a  hardwood  cutting 
Prune  the  parent  plant  rigorously  during  the 
dormant  season  to  encourage  fast-growing 
stems. 

At  "leaf  fall"  cut  a  hardwood  stem  with  all 
the  current  year's  growth,  using  a  pair  of 
shears.  Cut 
it  flush  with  the  parent  stem 

to  avoid  snags.  Make  a  sloping  cut  as  close 
as  possible  above  the  proposed  top  bud, 
remembering  that  the  bottom  part  of  the 
cutting  has  the  greatest  rooting  capacity. 
Make  a  horizontal  cut  exactly  6 in  below  the 
top  cut  ignoring  the  position  of  any  buds. 

Treat  only  the  cut  base  of  the  cutting,  and 
not the stem, with a rooting hormone powder. 
The  hardwood  strength  is  0.8  percent  IBA. 
If suitable stems  are  made  into cuttings  at the 
correct  season  then  the  rooting  hormone  will 
have  little  affect  except  with  plants  that  are 
difficult  to  root. 

Bundle  the  cuttings  made  at  "leaf  fall"  into 
quantities  of ten  or twelve and  heel  them  into 
a  sandbox,  almost  to  their  full  depth;  label, 
and  leave  for  the  rest  of  the  winter.  Alter(cid:173)
natively,  they  can  be  planted  directly  into 
well-cultivated  soil. 

Easily  rooted  plants  will  readily  survive  in 
the  open  ground,  whereas  less  easily  rooted 
plants  will  benefit  from  the  increased  tem(cid:173)

perature  and  less  fluctuating  environment  of 
a  cold  frame. 

Just  before  the  dormant  buds  break 

in 
spring,  dig  the  propagation  bed  thoroughly. 
Make a furrow  5 in  deep with  a spade.  Lift the 
cuttings  from  the  sandbox  and  plant  them 
vertically  in  the  furrow.  Allow  4 -6  in  between 
cuttings;  leave  12-15 in  between  rows  in  the 
open  ground  and  only 4 in  between  rows  in  a 
cold  frame.  Firm  back  the  soil,  leaving  about 
1 in  of  the  cuttings  exposed.  Label  each  row. 
Open-ground  cuttings  may  need  refirming 
if  lifted  by  frost.  Leave  the  cuttings  in  situ  for 
the growing season.  In  autumn,  lift the  rooted 
cuttings,  each  of  which  will  have  produced 
several  stems,  and  transplant  them  to  their 
final  situations  in  the  garden. 

Protect  cuttings  planted  in  a  cold  frame 
only  until  they  have  developed  some  roots 
and  then  harden  off.  It  becomes  increasingly 
difficult  to  harden  them  off  as  the  growing 
season  progresses. 

Disbudding 
A  plant  is  sometimes  needed  that  has a single 
stem, or "leg," at the bottom  and  many stems, 
or  branches,  farther  up  the  plant.  To  grow  a 
plant  with  this  characteristic,  a  hardwood 
cutting  needs  to  be  longer  than  the  normal 
6 in  and  have  more  than  1 in  exposed  above 
the  ground.  However;  a  longer  cutting  may 
encourage 
lower 
down  the  stem,  so  losing  the  desired  single 
stem.

pletely  with  a  sharp  knife;  ensure  no  latent 
buds  or  part-buds  remain.  It  is  simpler  to 
disbud  in  this  way  than  to  cut  out  stems  at 
a  later  date. 

Gooseberry  and  red  currant  bushes  are 
normally  propagated from 10-14 in  hardwood 
cuttings that  have  been  disbudded.  The  bush 
will  then  have  a  single  stem  at  the  bottom, 
which  will  allow  free  air  circulation  around 
the  bush,  thus  reducing  the  possibility  of 
mildew  attacks. 

To  produce  rose  rootstocks  take  an  Sin 
hardwood  cutting  and  remove  all  but  the 
top  two  buds  from  plants  such  as  Rosa  laxa 
and  Rosa  multiflora 
'Simplex.'  This  method 
will  avoid  rootstock  suckers. 

Seal  the  areas  that  have  been  disbudded 
to  prevent  rotting  and  disease.  It  is  possible 
to  leave  them  to  callus  over  naturally,  but 
unless  this  is  done  under  fairly  humid  con(cid:173)
ditions  there  is  always  the  danger  that  the 
cuttings  may  desiccate. 

It  is  better,  therefore,  to  paint  the  dis(cid:173)

budded  areas  with  paraffin  wax  or  more 
satisfactorily  with  a  proprietary  pruning  paint 
such  as  Arbrex. 

Treat  the  cuttings  with  rooting  hormone. 
Plant  the  rootstock  and  label  it.  For  roses,

Soft-  or  hollow-pith  stems 
For  many  woody  plants,  such  as  forsythia,  it 
is  not  possible 
to  propagate  hardwood 
cuttings  by  the  method  described  on  pages 
70-1  because they  have  a  soft  or  hollow  pith. 
If this  is  exposed,  it  very  often  provides  a  site 
for  rots  and  diseases,  which  will  then  kill  the 
cuttings. 

There  are  two  ways  of  overcoming  this 
problem:  either  make  the  hardwood  cutting 
exactly 6 in  long  and  then  seal  the  base  of the 
cutting  with  paraffin  wax,  or  make  the  basal 
cut  below  a  leaf  bud  joint.  Cuttings  treated 
by  either  of  these  methods  should  root  just 
as  prolifically  as  cuttings  with  a  solid  pith. 

Melt  some  paraffin  wax  until  it  is  liquid. 
Touch  the  base  of  a  6 in  cutting  in  the  wax 
so.  that  a  drop  of  wax  attaches,  cools  and 
sets  quickly,  so  sealing  the  cut.  Do  not  over(cid:173)
heat  the  wax  and  so  damage  the  plant. 

This  is a very satisfactory  method  of sealing 
these  cuttings,  but  take  care  not  to  damage 
the  wax  seal  when  the  cuttings  are  bundled, 
heeled  in  and  planted. 

The  alternative  method 

is  to  make'  the 
basal  cut at a node, that  is immediately  below 
a  leaf  joint,  where  the  pith  is  generally  solid. 
Make the  basal  cut at the  node  nearest to the 
normal  6 in  cutting  length.  Plants  such  as 
kerria  very  often  have  long  spaces  between 
nodes,  and  cuttings  may  then  become  as 
much  as  8 -9 in  long. 

to  cause 

It  is  often  recommended  that  plants  with 
a  soft  pith  should  be  cut  with  a  knife,  as  this 
tends 
less  damage  than  shears, 
which  may  crush  the  cutting.  Provided,  how(cid:173)

Conifers  are  predominantly  evergreen  trees 
and shrubs, some of which can be propagated 
from  softwood,  greenwood,  semiripe  and 
ripewood  cuttings.  In  general,  spruces,  firs 
and  pines  do  not  respond  to  propagation

Conifer  propagation  in  a warm  environment 
Conifer cuttings to  be  propagated  in the warm 
environment  of  a  closed  case  or  mist  unit 

should  have  a  softer  base  than  those  to  be

The  cuttings  will  root  within  three  to  four 

months.  Harden  off  and  pot  on  in  spring. 

Conifers  propagated  in  a  cold  frame 
It  is  easier,  but  slower,  to  propagate  conifer 
cuttings  in  a  cold  frame. 

Prepare  the  soil  in  the  propagation  bed 
before  taking  the  cuttings.  Raise  the  level  of 
the  soil  in  the  cold  frame  to  within  6-8 in  of 
the lid. This will  maintain an equable humidity 
and  temperature  for  the  cuttings. 

Pull  a  stem  backward  down  the  parent 
stem  to  obtain  a  cutting  with  a  heel,  which 
can  then  be  propagated  in  a  cold  frame. 

Trim  the  heel  of  the  cutting  with  a  sharp 
knife.  Remove the  leaves  on  the  bottom  third 
of  the  cutting  either  with  a  knife  or  by  hand 
provided  only  a  small  scar  is  caused  which 
may  actually  encourage  the  cutting  to  root. 
Do  not  remove  the  growing  point. 

Dip  the  base  of  the  cutting  in  a  rooting 
hormone  powder  of  ripewood  strength  (0.8 
percent  IBA).  Make  a  1 in  hole  with  a  dibble

Some  woody,  low-growing  plants,  such  as 
Salvia,  that  are  often  treated  as  herbaceous 
plants  are  called  subshrubs.  Most  of  them 
root  readily  and  can  easily  be  propagated 
from  stem  cuttings  taken  in  late  summer. 

Prune  the  parent  plant  during  the  dormant 
season  to  encourage  strong,  vigorous  shoots 
to  develop. 

Prepare  the  soil  in  a  cold  frame  by  digging 
deeply.  Add  grit  if  necessary  to  ensure  it  is 
free  draining. 

Cut  off  some  shoots  with  all  their  current 
season's  growth  in  late  summer  (usually  early 

September).  Select  nonflowering  shoots 
if 
possible,  although  with  many  plants,  such  as 
lavender,  these  may  be  difficult  to  find.  If 
flowering  shoots  have  to  be  used  then  cut 
back  the flower  and  its  stem  to  the  leafy  part. 
Cut  out  any  soft  growing  tip  with  a  sharp 
knife  or  pinch  it  out  between  the  thumb  and 
forefinger.  Make  the  basal  cut  with  shears 
about  4 in  below  the  top  of  the  cutting.  A 
quick  and  easy  way  to  measure  4 in  is  to 
hold  the  stem  in  the  palm  of an  adult's  hand. 
The  stem  will  be  approximately  4 in 
long 
where  it  reaches  the  butt  of  the  hand. 

Strip  the  leaves from  the  bottom  half  of the 
cutting,  either  by  pulling  very  carefully  or  by 
cutting  with  a  sharp  knife. 

Dip  the  base  of  the  cutting  into  a  rooting 
hormone  powder,  preferably  of  a  semi-
ripewood  strength  (0.4-0.5  percent  IBA). 

With  a  dibble  make  a  hole  in  the  prepared 
soil  about  half  the  length  of  the  cutting,  that 
is  about  2 in  deep.  Firm  the  soil  around  the 
cutting.  Leave  about  4 in  between  each

Leaf  cuttings  should  be  made  only  from

The  simplest  and  most  reliable  way  to  pro(cid:173)
duce  new  plants  from  leaf  cuttings  is  to  use 
a  complete  leaf  with  its  stalk.  The  disadvan(cid:173)
tage  of  this  method  is  that  it  develops  only 
a  few  new  plants  from  each  leaf. 

Rotting  and  disease  are the  main  causes  of 
failure  so  always  use  clean  tools,  containers 
and  composts. 

Leaf  petiole  cuttings  can  be  taken  at  any 
time  of  year  provided  a  new,  fully  expanded 
leaf  is  available. 

Make  up  a  cuttings  compost  of equal  parts 
sifted  peat  and  grit.  Fill  a  container  that  is 
large  enough  to  take  the  leaf  petiole  cuttings. 
Firm  the  compost  to  within  3/4  in  of  the  rim  of 
the  container. 

Slice  a  suitable  leaf  cleanly  through  the 
leaf stalk,  using a sharp knife or a single-edged 
razor  blade  to  ensure  the  least  possible  dam(cid:173)
age.  Leave about 2 in  of the leaf stalk attached 
to  the  leaf  blade. 

Make  a  small  hole  with  a  dibble  in  the 
compost  to  a  depth  just  sufficient  to  hold  the 
cutting.  Plant  at  a  shallow  angle  so  that  the 
leaf  blade  is  almost  flat  on  the  compost.  The 
shallower the  base  of the  stalk  is  planted  into 

the  compost  the  more  the  air  can  circulate 
around 
it,  which  will  encourage  a  quick 
response.  Then  firm  the  compost  around  the 
stalk.  When  the  cuttings are  all  planted,  label 
them  and  water  in  a  dilute  fungicide  such  as 
Captan  or  Benlate,  using  a fine  rose. 

Place  the  cuttings  in  an  environment  that 
maintains  a  steady  high  humidity,  so  that  the 
cuttings  do  not  dry  out.  The  temperature,

for  houseplants,  needs 

Expose  the  cuttings  to  sufficient  light  for 
them  to  manufacture  food  and  develop  the 
new  plantlets.  Too  much  sunlight  may  scorch 
the cuttings. In general, light shade is the best 
compromise. 

The  new  plantlets  will  develop  on  the  cut 
surface  of  the  leaf  stalk  within  five  to  six 
weeks,  and  several  may  appear  at  this  point. 
Leave  them  until  they  can  be  handled  and 
separated  into  individual  plants,  potted  on 
and  hardened  off.  If  it  is  likely  to  be  some 
time  before  they  are

Before  taking  cuttings,  ensure  all  tools  and

LEAF  CUTTINGS  ON  LATERAL  VEINS 
Lay  a  leaf  upside  down  on  a clean  sheet  of 
glass.  Remove  the  midrib  with  a  razor 
blade  so  that  the  two  halves  of  the  leaf-

have  an  exposed  cut  surface.

the  leaf  cuttings  vertically  in  the  trench 
with  the  cut  surfaces  of  the  lateral  veins

dependent  on  the  surrounding  temperature: 
at 21Â°C/70Â°F,  plantlets  should  appear  in  three

leaves  and  especially 

Any  leaf  that  will  regenerate  vegetatively  can 
be  propagated  from

method  is  normally  used  only  for  plants  with 
big

varieties.  Its  main  advantage  is  that  it  pro(cid:173)
duces  numerous  plantlets  from  a  single  leaf. 
This  method  of  propagation  produces 
small  pieces  of  cut  leaf  that  are  prone  to 
rotting.  Therefore  clean,  sterile 
tools  and 
equipment  should  be  used  at  all  times  and 
scrupulous,  hygienic  measures  should  be 
observed. 

Fill  a  clean  plastic  seed  tray  with  cuttings 
compost  and  press  the  compost to  give  a flat 
surface  about  f in  below  the  rim.  Water  the 
compost  thoroughly  and  allow  to  drain. 

Remove  a  fully  expanded,  undamaged  leaf 
from  the  parent  plant  and  place  it  face  down 
on  a clean  sheet  of glass.  Take a single-edged 
razor  blade  and  ruler  and  cut  this  leaf  into  a 
series of 3/4 in squares, placing the ruler gently 
on  the  leaf  to  avoid  crushing.  Any  damaged 
squares  must  be  discarded. 

Lay  the  cuttings  flat  on  the  compost  with 
the  top  side  facing  upward.  Place  in  rows 

about  1/2  in  apart.  Label  the  seed  tray  clearly. 
Spray  the  cuttings  with  a  fungicide  such  as 
Captan  or  Benlate. 

Cover  the  seed  tray  with  a  clean  sheet  of 
glass  to  maintain  humidity.  Place  in  a  warm 
(18-21Â°C/65-70Â°F)  environment  out  of  direct 
sunlight,  but  make  sure  there  is  sufficient 
light  available  to  allow  the  leaves  to  manu(cid:173)
facture food.  A  closed  case  is  ideal,  although 
a  window  sill  in  a  warm  room  facing  east  or 
west  is  also  suitable. 

If  the  compost  was  thoroughly  watered 
initially  and  the  seed  tray  is  covered,  little  or 
no  more watering  will  be  needed.  Should  the 
compost  dry  out,  rewet  by  standing the  seed 
tray  in  a water  bath. 

Plantlets  should  appear  on  the  cut  surfaces 
of  the  larger  leaf  veins  nearest  to  the  leaf 
stalk.  At  a  temperature  of  21Â°C/70"F,  this 
should  occur  after  about five  or six weeks,  but 
the  new  plants  will  not  be  big  enough  to  pot 
on  for  several  more  weeks.  When  the  first 
leaves  have  opened,  gradually  harden  off  by 
airing  the  seed  tray.  Pot  up  when  the  plants 
are a sufficient size to  handle without damage. 

Monocotyledonous  plants,  such  as  snow(cid:173)
drops  and  mother-in-law's  tongues,  have  a 
series  of  parallel  veins  running  the  length  of 
each  leaf.  Some  of these  plants  can  be  propa(cid:173)

of their  leaves.  As  a  result these  cells,  or foliar

some  of  these  plants,  such  as  Mitella,  have

Grafting  is  a  technique  of  joining  two  parts 
of  different  plants  together  in  such  a  way that 
they  will  unite  and  continue  their  growth  as 
one  plant. 

One part,  called the scion,  is usually a stem 
is 
from  the  plant  to  be  propagated.  This 
grafted  onto  a  root  system 
from  another 
plant,  which  is  called  the  rootstock  (also,  the 
stock  or  understock).  All  the  various  tech(cid:173)
niques  of  joining  plants  are  called  grafting, 
although,  when  buds  only  are  joined  to  the 
rootstock,  it  is  sometimes  called  budding. 

There  are 

two  basic  grafting  positions: 

apical  grafting,  in  which  the  top  of  the  root(cid:173)
stock  is  removed  and  is  replaced  with  the 
scion;  and  side  grafting,  in  which  the  scion 
is  grafted  on  to  the  side  of the  rootstock  and 
the  rootstock  above  the  graft  is  not  removed 
until  after  a  union  is  achieved. 

Because time-consuming  preparation  work 
is  necessary  before two  plants  can  be joined, 
grafting  is  superficially  a  less  attractive  tech(cid:173)
nique  than  other  relatively  easy  methods  of 
vegetative  propagation,  such  as  taking  stem 

cuttings  or  layering.  However,  some  plants 
such  as witch  hazel  are  not  easily  propagated 
by  any  other  vegetative  method  if  selected 
forms  are  required,  and  so  they  are  grafted 
onto  rootstocks. 

rootstocks, 

to  control  both 

Perhaps  the  most  useful  reason  for grafting 
is 
to 
transfer  the  benefits  of  a  particular 
rootstock  on  to  another  plant.  Various  fruit-
tree 
for  example,  have  been 
developed 
the  size  and 
fruiting  vigor  of  other  varieties  of  fruit  tree. 
Other  advantages 
that  a  rootstock  might 
possess  are  resistance  to  pests  and  diseases; 
toleration  of  high  soil-moisture 
levels  and 
salt  concentrations;  and  toleration  of  high 
alkalinity levels in the soil. The more rootstock 
incorporated 
into  a  new  plant, 
the  more 
influence  the  rootstock  will  have. 

Another  advantage  of grafting  is  that  more 
than  one  scion  can  be  joined  onto  a  plant. 
This  is  particularly  useful  with  fruit  trees  as  a 
suitable  pollinator  variety  can  be  grafted  into 
a  tree  or  bush  already  grafted  with  another 
variety,  or  it  may  allow  a  decorative  stem  to 
be  grafted  on  and  then  be  top  worked  with 
another  variety. 

There  are  a  number  of  problems associated 
with  grafting.  The  main  one  is  ensuring  two 
plants  are  compatible.  This  limitation  deter(cid:173)
mines  which  variety and  species  of  plants  can 
be grafted  onto which  rootstocks;  in general, 
it  is  normal  to  graft  varieties  onto  their  own 
species  or  very  closely  related  ones. 

To  graft  successfully,  it  is  vitally  important 
to  position  the  various  tissues  of  the  stem 
correctly  so  that  the  stem  can  make  a  quick 
and  continuous  union.  The  cambium  is  the 
actively growing  part of the stem  that lies just 
under  the  bark.  This  cambium  layer  on  both 
the  scion  and  the  rootstpck  must  be  pos(cid:173)
itioned  so  they  are  absolutely  adjacent  to 
each  other,  or  at  least  in  as  much  contact  as 
possible. 

The  successful  formation  of  a  graft  also 
depends  on  making  and  matching  cuts 
quickly  and  cleanly:  the  cut  surfaces  must  be 
placed  in  contact with the  minimum  of delay. 
Should  the  surfaces  dry  out,  the  tissues  will 
die  and  so  make  an  effective  barrier  to  the 
development  of  a  successful  union. 

The  making  of  a  graft  union  is  only  partly 
to  successful  carpentry.  Much  also 

due 

depends  on  providing  suitable  conditions  for 
the  tissues  to  develop  and  grow  to  form  a 
successful  union.  In  effect,  this  means  that 
water  loss  must  be  prevented  and  warmth 
must  be  provided  round  the  grafted  parts  by 
carefully  covering

joined  together.

Traditionally,  the  grafted  parts  have  been 
covered  and  tied  together  with  raffia,  but 
most  grafts  are  now  enclosed  by  1/2  in  wide

Once  the  grafted  parts  have  successfully 
united,  the  development  of  the  new  plant 
depends  on  preventing  any 
further  com(cid:173)

remove  all  subsequent  growths  from  any(cid:173)

is 

Shield-budding,  however,  must  normally wait 
until  midsummer  when  the  bark  lifts  easily 
from  the  wood  on  the  rootstock. 

Whip-and-tongue  grafting 
Whip-and-tongue  grafting  is  commonly  used 
to  propagate  fruit  trees,  although  the  tech(cid:173)
nique  can  be  employed  successfully  for  trees 
and  shrubs  with  tissues  that  will  also  readily 
unite  at  relatively  low  temperatures. 

Select  a  plant  that  will  be  suitable  as  root(cid:173)
stock and  plant  it outdoors.  Label  it and  leave 
it  to  establish  for  one  growing  season. 

In  midwinter,  select  a  plant  that  is  suitable 

as  scion  material.  From  it  take  some  hard(cid:173)
wood  stems  with  all  their  previous  season's 
growth.  Bundle  these  scions  together  and 
heel them  into 6 in of soil in a well-drained cool 
position.  Firm  back  the  soil  and  label  them. 
W h en  the  scions  are  eventually  grafted  in 
spring,  they  will  be  less  developed  than  the 
growth  on  the  rootstock. 

Prepare  the  rootstock  once  its  sap  has 
started  to  rise;  this  is  usually  just  before  the 
leaf  buds  break.  Trim  to  make  a  single  stem 
with  no  branches. 

Fruit  trees  (-especially  apples)  are  grafted  at 
9-10 in  above  soil  level  to  avoid  problems 
such  as  collar  rot.  Ornamental  plants,  on  the 
other  hand,  are grafted  as close to the ground 
as  feasible,  to  avoid  unsightly  bulges  that 
may  occur  with  certain 
rootstock/scion 
combinations. 

Cut  back  the  rootstock  to  the  appropriate 
height  with  a  pair  of  sharp  shears.  Then 
make a 11/2 in sloping cut across the top, using 
a  sharp  knife. 

Lift  the  scions  from  the  ground.  Select  one 
that  has  a  similar diameter  at  its  base  to  that 
of  the  rootstock  top.  Take  a  sharp  knife  and 
make  a  top  cut  close  above  a  bud  about four 
to  five  buds  from  the  scion  base.  Then  make 
a  sloping  11/2  in  cut  across  the  base  of  the 
scion,  ending  it  just  below  a  bud;  ensure  the 
cut  is  at  the  same  angle  as  the  rootstock  cut. 
This  is  a  splice  or  whip  graft.  To  provide 

rigidity,  add  a  tongue  to  the  cuts. 

The  tongue  is  made  from  single  cuts  on 
both  the  scion  and  rootstock.  From  one-
third  of  the  way  down  the  sloping  cut  on  top 
of  the  rootstock,  make  a  shallow,  single  1/2  in 
slice  down  into  the  rootstock. 

Make the scion tongue by cutting for 1/2 in 
from  one-third  of the way up the scion sloping 
cut,  keeping  the  knife  blade  at  the  same 
angle  as  the  tongue  on  the  rootstock. 

Slip  the  scion  into  the  rootstock  so  they 
interlock.  If  the  rootstock  is  thicker  than  the 
scion,  move  it  to  one  side  until  there  is  good 
contact  between 
layers. 
Bind  with  clear  polyethylene  grafting  tape  to 
hold  the  join  firmly.  Seal  the  top  of  the  scion

the ground. This will  prevent the scions drying 
out,  and  will  keep  them  cool  and  retard  their 
development.  Label  them  clearly. 

In  late  winter/early  spring,  select  a  suitable

Crafting  is  carried  out  on  the  top  of  the 
root  or  in  the  hypocotyl  of  the  seedling.  Cut

sharp  knife.  Then  make  a  single  11/4  in  cut 
vertically  down  the  middle  of  the  rootstock. 
Lift the scions;  choose one that  has  plump, 
healthy  buds  and  is  of  similar  diameter to  the 
top  of  the  rootstock.  Make  a  sloping  cut  just 
above  a  bud  at  the  top,  using  a  sharp  knife. 
Then  make a  horizontal  cut  about  6 in  below.

widely  used to  propagate both  deciduous  and

is  available  and 

The  usual  season for side-wedge grafting  is 
in  late winter/early  spring,  just  before the  leaf 
buds  break.  However,  with  evergreen  plants 
is  feasible  whenever  a  mature  flush  of 
it 
growth 
is 
growing  actively.  For  very  sappy  plants,  that 
is  those  plants  that  "bleed"  when  cut,  it  is 
advisable  to  graft  early  in  the  growing  season 
and  dry  the  rootstocks  off  before  doing  so. 
Establish  a  one-year-old  labeled  seedling 
in  a  pot  and  grow  it  for  a  year.  Ensure  this 
seedling,  which  will  form  the  rootstock,  is 
related  to  and  therefore  compatible  with  the 
plant  to  be  grafted  onto  it. 

About  three  weeks  before  grafting,  place 
the  potted  rootstock  in  a  frost-free  area  to 
encourage  it  to  grow.  Dry  off  the  rootstock, 
especially  deciduous  rootstock,  by  keeping 
watering to  a  bare  minimum  or  indeed  by  not 
watering  at  all.  Trim  the  leaves  off the  bottom 
3-4 in  of  the  rootstock  stem. 

Select  a  plant

Watering 

is  probably  the  most  difficult 
aspect  of  graft  management.  Water  little  and 
often  rather  than  in  large  doses  at  infrequent 
intervals,  so  that  the  plant  is  kept  on  the  dry 
side  in  a  humid  environment. 

possible,  collect  these  stems  with  their  apical 
buds  intact. 

Select  a  stem,  or  scion,  of  comparable 
thickness  to  the  rootstock.  Make  two  sloping 
11/2  in  cuts  on  the  scion  base,  opposite  each 
other,  so  that  a  wedge  shape  is  produced. 

Starting  about  2 in  above  soil  level,  cut 
downward  into  the  rootstock  for  1  1/2  in  and 
inward  to  about  a  third  of the  stem  thickness. 
Gently  bend  the  rootstock  away  from  this 
cut  so  that  it  opens  sufficiently  to  insert  the 
scion.  If  the  scion  is  narrower  than  the  root(cid:173)
stock,  match  up  the  cambial  layers  on  one 
side.  Release  the  tension  on  the  rootstock. 

Bind  with  clear  polyethylene  tape,  over(cid:173)
lapping  it to  seal  the entire  cut  area  and  label. 

Stand  the  grafted  rootstock  in  a  green(cid:173)
house,  and  the two  parts should  join  in  about 
six  to  eight  weeks,  depending  on  the  species. 
This  environment  is  preferable  to  a  warm, 
humid  one,  such  as  a  closed  case,  where the 
buds  would  be  encouraged  to  develop  and, 
once  the  two  parts  have  joined,  the  grafted 
rootstock  would  need  hardening  off,  which 
can  be  extremely  difficult  to  do  satisfactorily. 
Remove  the  polyethylene  tape  and  cut 
back  half  the  rootstock  above  the  grafted 
area  as  soon  as  the  two  parts  have  joined. 

Label  the  grafted  rootstock  and  keep  it 
warm  and  humid  to  encourage  the  plant  to 
grow  and  the  grafted  parts  to  join  up.  A 
closed  case  with  or  without  heat  from  below 
is  a  suitable  environment. 

Water  the  pot  sparingly,  keeping  the  plant 

on  the  dry  side  until  callusing  occurs. 

Conifers,  if  grown  close  together  in  pots 
under  warm,  humid  conditions,  are  subject 
to  various  leaf  diseases  and  rots,  and  to  red 

spider  mite  infestations,  so  spray  regularly 
with  fungicides  and  pesticides. 

Take the grafted  rootstock out of the closed 
case  and  harden  off  on 
the  greenhouse 
bench,  once  the  parts  have  united.  This 
should  be  within  six  to  ten  weeks.  Remove 
the  polyethylene  tape  and  reduce  the  top  of 
the  rootstock  by  one-third  immediately.  After 
a fortnight,  remove a further third.  After  mid(cid:173)
summer,  head  back any  remaining  rootstock. 

Traditionally,  side-veneer  grafts  have  been 
used  to  propagate  conifers,  but they  are  now 
often carried  out on  any  plant suitable for side 
grafting.  The  join  resulting  from  this  method 
of  grafting  is  slightly  more  upright  than  one 
from  a  side-wedge  graft  (see  page  89). 

Conifers,  when  cut,  exude 

resin  and, 
although  this  can  be  reduced  by  drying  off 
the  rootstocks  before  grafting,  the  resin  will 
still  adhere  to  a  knife  blade  and  so  impair  its 
efficiency  and  cutting  edge.  Therefore,  keep 
the  knife  blade  clean  by  wiping  it  regularly 
with  some  absorbent  material  soaked  in  an 
organic  solvent  such  as  acetone.  It  is  im(cid:173)
portant  to  wipe  the  solvent  off  the  blade 
with  a  clean  cloth  otherwise  it  could  pollute 
the  tissues  of  any  plant  through  which  the 
knife  blade  subsequently  cuts. 

Rootstocks for side-veneer grafts are almost 
invariably  pot grown,  as the fine, fibrous  roots 
of  the  conifer  are  prone  to  drying  out. 

Graft  conifers  either  in 

late  winter/early 
spring  or  during  late  summer,  although  the 
latter  period  causes  problems  as  the  trees 
have to  be  kept alive  over the winter  and  then 
need  to  be  hardened  off  in  spring. 

In  late  winter/early  spring,  dry  off  the  pot-
grown  conifer  that  will  form  the  rootstock  by 
watering  less  than  usual.  Because  it  is  ever(cid:173)
green,  this  drying  off  should  not  be  as  drastic 
as  for  deciduous  plants. 

After 

the 

three  weeks,  once 

rootstock 
shows  signs  of growth,  grafting  is  carried  out. 
Select  a  conifer  that  has  suitable  scion 
material  and  cut  off  a  leader  shoot  of  one 
season's  growth.  The  length  of  the  shoot,  or 
scion,  will  very  much  depend  on  the  vigor 
of  growth,  but  it  must  include  some  mature 
brown-barked  wood.  Strip  off the  leaves  from 
the  bottom  third  of  the  scion.  Make  a  11/4  in 
sloping  cut  down  to  the  scion  base,  using  a 
sharp  knife.  Then  turn  the  scion  over  and 
make  a  very  small  wedge  cut. 

Trim  any  leaves  off  the  bottom  6 in  of  the 
rootstock  stem.  About 21/2-3 in  above  soil 
level,  make  a 11/4in sloping  cut  downward 
and  inward  to  give  a  shallow  cut  about  1/8  in 
deep  at  the  bottom.  Then  make  a  slightly 
downward  and  inward  nick  lower  down  the 
rootstock  to  join  the  first  cut.  Remove  the 
sliver  of  wood  from  the  rootstock.  Place  the 
rootstock  and  scion  together.  If  their  sizes 
match  they  will  be  easier  to  manipulate.  If 
the  scion  is  narrower  than  the  rootstock,  set 
to  one  side  to  match  up  the  cambial  layers. 
The  interlocking  bases  of  the  two  grafted 
parts  will  provide  some  rigidity,  but 
they 
should  also  be  tied  together firmly. 

It  is  possible  to  use  a  rubberized  strip  as  a 

tie, but clear polyethylene tape is just as effec(cid:173)
tive  and  has 
the  added  advantage  of 
preventing  water  loss  from  around  the  cuts. 

Shield-budding,  or  T-budding,  is  a  traditional 
way  to  propagate  rosaceous  plants  by  graft(cid:173)
ing.  A  bud  from  the  plant to  be  propagated  is 
placed  behind  the  bark  of  the  rootstock  so 
that  the  back  of  the  bud  and  the  exposed 
surface  of the  rootstock  wood  are  in  contact. 
However,  this  technique  can  only  be  carried 
out when  the  bark  of the  rootstock  lifts  easily; 
this  is  normally  between  May  and  August. 

Select  a  suitable  rootstock,  either  a  seed(cid:173)

ling  or  a  one-year-old  layer.  Plant  it  in  some 
open  ground  during  the  winter.  Label  it  and 
allow  to  establish. 

As  soon  as  the  bark  lifts  easily  from  the 
wood  underneath,  prepare  the  rootstock  for 

shield-budding.  Insert  a  rose  bud 
into  the 
hypocotyl of a seedling rose (see page 92) and 
a  tree  bud  into  a  stem  of  a  compatible  root(cid:173)
stock  at  the  required  height. 

Cut  off  any  leaves  and  branches  on  the 
bottom  12 in  of  the  rootstock.  Make  a  T-
shaped  incision  through  the  bark  by  cutting 
a  horizontal  slit and then a vertical  downward 
incision  sufficiently  large  to  take  a  suitable 
bud.  The  taut  bark  will  begin  to  spring  away 
from  the  wood  underneath.  Loosen  the  two 
flaps  slightly  to  receive  the  bud. 

Select  a  plant  that  has  suitable  budding 
material.  Cut  off  a  stem  with  all  the  current 
year's  growth  and  with  plump,  healthy  buds. 

Remove  the  leaves,  but  leave  about  1/2  in  of 
each  leaf  stalk  attached  to  the  stem. 

When  shield-budding,  always  select  buds 
from  the  middle  of a  stem  where the  buds are 
mature.  Do  not  take  them  from  the  bottom 
of  the  stem  because  they  may  be  latent,  nor 
from  the  top  where  they  will  be  immature. 

Cut  shallowly  into  the  stem,  or  bud  stick, 
about  1/4  in  below  a  mature  bud;  then  cut 
shallowly  underneath  the  b u d;  when  past  it, 
lift  off  the  bud  together  with  a  tail  of  bark. 
Ensure

damaging  the  "eye"  of  the  bud.

the  cut 

Remove  any  wood  from  under  the  bark  by 
bending  the  bark  outward  and  flicking  the 

wood  out.  If  the  bud  trace  comes  out  with 
the  wood,  the  bud  is  not  mature  and  should 
be  discarded. 

Using the leaf stalk as a handle, slip the bud 
into  the  T-cut  on  the  rootstock,  and  trim  off 
the  tail  flush  with  the  horizontal  cut. 

Tie  the  budded  rootstock  with  clear  poly(cid:173)
ethylene  tape,  leaving  the  bud  and  leaf  stalk 
exposed,  and  label  it. 

After  three  to  four  weeks  the  bud  will  have 
united  with  the  rootstock  and  the  tape  can 
be  removed. 

In  late winter/early  spring,  cut  back the top 
of the  rootstock  to  just  above  the  bud,  which 
will  then grow out  during the following spring. 

Hybrid  Tea  and  Floribunda  roses  should  be 
propagated  by  inserting  buds  into  seedling 
rootstocks  rather  than  by  taking  stem  cut(cid:173)
tings.  The  advantage  of  rose  budding  is  that

the  vigor 
of  the  weaker  varieties,  which  on  their  own 
roots  may grow only 9 in or so, while reducing 
the  potential  of  the  more  vigorous  ones, 
which  might  otherwise  reach  14-16 ft  tall.

The  selection  of a suitable  rootstock  is  one 

of the  most  important  decisions  when  propa(cid:173)
gating  roses.  Although  it  is  possible  to  collect 
a  seedling  of the  wild  rose from  the  hedgerow 
and  use  this  as  rootstock, 
this  not  only 
denudes  the  natural  flora  of  the  countryside 
but  in fact  is  not  really  desirable as  rootstock. 
rootstock  should  not  produce 
suckers  once  the  bush  is  eventually  planted 
in  its  permanent  position.  It  should  ideally  be 
of  a  variety  that  grows  few  thorns,  and  the 
actual  process  of  budding will  be  easier  if the 
neck  of  the  rootstock  is  relatively  long.  All 
these  advantages  are found  in  Rosa  laxa.

Loosen  the  two  flaps  of  bark  a  little. 

Select  a  plant  that  has  suitable  budding 
material.  From  it  choose  a  stem  in  which  the 
flowers  have  just  "blown,"  that  is,  gone  over, 
and  remove  this  stem  with  all  its  current 
season's  growth.  At  this  stage  virtually  all  the 
buds  on  the  stem  will  be  suitable  for  propa(cid:173)
gation.  Remove the  leaves  from  the  stem. 

Standard  roses 
Standard  roses  are  propagated  on  to  root(cid:173)
stocks  of  Rosa  rugosa,  which  has  single  stems 
usually  6-8ft  tall.  Plant  in  winter  in  a  row  and 
support  on  wire  attached  to  posts.  Budding 
takes  place  during 
following  summer 
when  the  bark  lifts.  Two  or  sometimes  three 

the 

buds  in  a  close  spiral  are  worked  on  the 
rootstock  in  order  to  produce  a  more  even 
and  regular  head.  The  height  at  which  the 
leaf  buds  are  inserted  will  depend  on  the 
length  of  stem  required.  A  standard  rose  is 
usually budded at about 31/2 ft; a half-standard 
at about 21/2 ft. 

Hold  a  sharp  knife  just  below  a  bud.  Cut 
shallowly  toward  the  tip  of  the  stem  around 
the  bud.  Lift  off the  bud  together  with  its  tail. 
Insert  the  bud,  tail  upward,  between  the 
flaps  of  bark  on  the  rootstock.  Trim  the  tail 
flush  with  the  horizontal  cut.  Cover  the  bud 
with  a  rubber  budding  patch  and  pin  it  in 
position.  This  patch,  which  is  made  of  non-
vulcanized  rubber,  will  perish  at  about  the 
same  rate  as  the  bud  unites  with  the  root(cid:173)
stockâ€”in  about 
five  weeks.  This 
means  that  the  rubber  patch  does  not  need 
cutting  as  it  will  not  constrict  the  rapidly

replant  the  bush  in  its  final  place. 

Chip-budding  is  perhaps  the  easiest  way  to 
bud  a  plant  as 
few 
actions  and,  more  importantly,  it  provides 
greater  cambial  contact  between  rootstock 
and  scion  than  does  shield-budding.

it 

A  "chip"  of  bark  and  wood  is  removed 
from the  rootstock and  replaced with a "chip" 
of  similar  dimensions  carrying  a  bud  from  the 
plant  to  be  propagated. 

Chip-budding  can  be  used  to  propagate 
any  rosaceous  plant,  provided  that  the  wood 
is  sufficiently  hard  and  mature.  For  the  tech(cid:173)

Chip-budding  can  be  carried  out  at  any 
time  of year  provided  that  well-matured  buds 
are  available  and 
temperatures  are  high 
least  10Â°C/50Â°F)  to  produce  a

Although  this  technique  could  be  used  on 
rootstocks  such  as  Magnolia 

pot-grown 
grandiflora,  it  is  usually  carried  out  on  root(cid:173)
stocks  that  have  been  planted  in  winter  in 
the  open  ground. 

In  midsummer,  remove  all  branches  and 

leaves  from  the  bottom  12-15  in  of  the  root(cid:173)
stock  stem. 

Select  a  plant  that  is  suitable  for  budding. 
Cut  off  some  vegetative  shoots  with  all  their 
current  year's  growth  and  with  well-matured 
buds,  at  least  toward  their  base.  Discard  the 
softer  top  growth  and  carefully  remove  all 
the  leaves flush  with  the  stem. 

Make  a 1/4in cut  down  into  the  rootstock 
stem,  at  an  angle of about 45  degrees.  Start  a 
top cut 11/4" in above the lower cut and angle it 
down  to  join  the  basal  cut;  remove  the  chip. 
Select  a  stem,  or  bud  stick,  that  has  a 
similar  diameter  to  the  rootstock  so  that  it  is 
easy  to  match  the  cuts. 

Make  exactly  similar  cuts  on  the  bud  stick 
as  on  the  rootstock,  ensuring  that  a  bud  is 
included  midway  down  the  chip. 

Tuck  the  bud  chip  into  position  on  the 
rootstock  and 
tie  with  polyethylene  tape, 
overlapping  the  tape  so  that  it  seals  the  chip 
completely.  Then  label. 

After  three  to  four  weeks  the  bud  will  have 
united  with  the  rootstock  and  the  tape  can 
be  removed,  so  allowing the  bud  to  swell. 

In  winter,  cut  the  rootstock  right  back, 
close  above the  bud  but without  damaging  it. 
The  bud  will  grow  out  the  following  season. 
If  budding  is  done  early,  the  bud  may  grow 
out  before  the  end  of the  season.
