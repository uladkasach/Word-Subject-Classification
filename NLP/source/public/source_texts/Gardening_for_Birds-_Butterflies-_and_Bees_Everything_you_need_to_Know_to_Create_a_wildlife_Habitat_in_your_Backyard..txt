Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees

INTRODUCTION
Birds, butterflies and bees rely on plants, trees and shrubs to survive and thrive.
That’s why doing your part for the environment by establishing wildlife-friendly areas in your own backyard is so crucial. Chances are, your garden is already a welcoming space for all kinds of nature, but with a little extra research and planning, you can take your gardening a couple steps further and transform your yard into a healthier and happier sanctuary for birds, butterflies and bees.
This book, brought to you by the editors of Birds & Blooms magazine, can serve as your guide to attracting new visitors to your landscape. Birds & Blooms has helped lead the trend we like to call “gardening with a purpose” for over 20 years. We’ve always recognized the importance of going beyond just the beauty of a garden, and purposefully choosing flowers, trees and shrubs for their environmental benefits.
We even went a step further and put together some handy symbols to help you achieve the wildlife-friendly backyard of your dreams. Look for the symbols next to each plant profile to discover what the plant will attract. (Some plants are a triple whammy and attract birds, butterflies and bees!) For extra guidance, check the light-requirement symbols. You’ll be able to quickly see if a plant should be grown in shade, part shade or full sun—vital info you need to know to create a great habitat.
Once you’ve established a flourishing backyard, be sure to enjoy your new guests. Throughout this book, we’ve highlighted over 60 bird species and 34 butterfly species you might see in your space. Have fun identifying all of the birds, butterflies and bees in your own backyard!
CREATE HABITAT
If you want to create a wildlife-friendly backyard, you must keep three basics in mind: food, water and shelter. Plants are key, but you can also add birdbaths, feeders and nest boxes.

 Gardening for Birds
It’s no secret that you can successfully attract birds with feeders, but what birds need even more than feeders full of seed comes straight from nature: plants and trees. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep those feeders full, though! But going the extra mile to attract birds with plants and trees will reward you with even more feathered visitors.
Native plants are key, because they’ll keep the birds coming back to backyards for more. Berries and seeds bring in more bluebirds, orioles, goldfinches and a whole long list of other most-wanted species. For example, goldfinches often arrive as soon as the first few seeds mature, even while the plant is still in bloom. They’ll keep returning in the coming weeks, joined by native sparrows, woodpeckers, juncos, cardinals, chickadees and more.

Choose Natives
When it comes to food offerings, seeds and berries are probably the most obvious, but birds are also drawn to something else on the plants that we may never even notice: insects. And the ultimate insect trump card? Caterpillars.
Caterpillars are crucial because they’re a prime target for parent birds who have to satisfy a nest full of begging beaks. Birds will eat berries and seeds from nonnative plants, but caterpillars are super finicky and mainly feed on all-American trees, shrubs and flowers. The birds are more than happy to pluck these chubby crawlers from host plants like red-twig dogwood, blueberries and spicebush.
Insects aside, native plants also serve as building supply stores for birds. To make their nests, birds collect twigs and dead leaves or needles from trees and shrubs, and strip fibers and bark from milkweed, Indian hemp, wild grapevines and other natives.
Native plants form symbiotic bonds with birds. The birds get a bounty of food and in return spread seeds to sprout into new plants. But natives are a big win for gardeners, too. They are generally hardy, dependable and low-maintenance and require no coddling to thrive.
Lately, “native” has become something of a buzzword, splashed across just about any plant that originated in North America, which isn’t very helpful, because many natives are highly particular about where they’ll grow. The saw palmetto of Florida is an American native, but it’s not going to be happy in Minnesota and Minnesota’s balsam fir definitely won’t feel at home in Florida.
If you’re just getting started planting natives for birds, daisies are a good choice for beginners, because each flower holds scores of seeds for foraging goldfinches and other friends. All-American native daisies include sunflowers, native asters, coneflowers and black-eyed Susans. (But avoid Goldsturm, a variety of black-eyed Susan that rarely sets seed.) All are top targets of seed-loving birds.
Unless you know what’s native to your region, look for widespread natives, those that naturally grow across a big swath of North America. Adaptable enough to flourish in a variety of soils and conditions, they’re a good bet for most gardens.

Grow Berry Plants
Another secret to a bird-friendly native garden is to have a mix of seed plants and berries. Native berries attract our most-wanted bird friends, including many that aren’t backyard feeder regulars. Bluebirds, thrushes, rose-breasted grosbeaks, tanagers, orioles, thrashers, vireos, wood warblers, cedar waxwings, great crested flycatchers—more than 100 species—may visit as soon as the crop begins to ripen.
Plant a hedge of elderberries, dot a solid wall of arborvitae with winterberries, add a serviceberry or flowering dogwood to your flowerbeds, and slip in some blueberries among the azaleas. The downside of planting native berries is that, though it works like a charm, the berries vanish in a hurry. Birds strip berries fast—often in just a few weeks!
Even when they’re young, native oaks, maples, ashes, hackberries, black cherries and other large trees attract birds to their sheltering branches and the insects that take up residence on them. Several years down the road, their nuts, seeds or fruit will bring in the birds big-time. Add trees to your yard if you have the space and enjoy the benefits.
With hundreds of natives to choose from in any area, how do you whittle down the selection? Go for those with the greatest appeal—to both you and the birds. If you’re looking for a fast payoff, focus on native shrubs and small trees for berries, and flowers for seeds.

 Gardening for Butterflies
If you have attracting butterflies on the brain, it’s easy to turn your yard into a nonstop butterfly bonanza. When it comes to these fliers, it really is as simple as: “If you build it, they will come.” The best butterfly gardens take a little planning but are mostly self-sufficient once they’re up and blooming.
You might think of open sunny meadows when you think of butterflies, but don’t worry if you only have a small space. A butterfly garden can be as small as a few pots on your back porch, or as large as your whole yard. Include some shady spots if possible—some butterflies prefer it. Remember that the best butterfly gardens can sometimes look a little overgrown or ragged, so don’t expect to make this a formal focal point if a pristine garden is important to you.

Plant Butterfly Food Sources
Most butterflies get the majority of their diet from nectar-producing plants, so these should make up the largest part of your garden. Choose native plants when possible, because natives will thrive with little care and often draw the most butterflies. Anchor your garden with a few larger nectar-producing shrubs and add groupings of flowering plants in a variety of colors, heights and flower sizes. Be sure to choose plants that flower in early spring as well as late fall—times when butterflies sometimes struggle to find food.
Your local extension office can provide a list of the best nectar plants for your area, but good bets for almost anyone include salvia, lantana, pentas, aster, marigold, zinnia and coneflower. Buddleia, also known as butterfly bush, can be a good choice in some areas, but make sure it’s not considered invasive before you plant.
Not all butterflies rely on nectar plants. Some, like mourning cloaks and red-spotted purples, actually prefer to feed on tree sap or rotting fruit. You can offer fruit like bananas, strawberries and oranges for these butterflies. Keep ants away by filling a shallow dish with water and setting the fruit in the middle.

Provide Water and Shelter
Butterflies get most of the water they need from nectar, but not all. They use their delicate proboscises to sip water from dewdrops and puddles. Some butterflies, like sulphurs and tiger swallowtails, are especially inclined to gather in large numbers around muddy areas. (The mud provides much-needed salt.) Mimic these natural water areas with a shallow dish of wet sand or mud, or spray down your garden with a fine mist to provide water droplets on the plants.
Butterflies are small and fragile creatures. Raindrops can seem more like bowling balls to them, so when bad weather threatens, butterflies seek shelter. They also need places to roost overnight. Though you can buy ready-made butterfly houses, you’ll find butterflies are more likely to use natural areas like tall grasses and thick shrubs. Some butterflies even overwinter in crevices inside tree bark and rocks. Others spend the winter as caterpillars or chrysalides buried deep in the leaf litter beneath trees, so don’t be too quick to remove all that fallen foliage each autumn.
The Importance of Host Plants
Any legitimate wildlife garden provides a place for creatures to raise their young. While butterflies are anything but dutiful parents—they lay their eggs and then leave the young caterpillars to fend for themselves—they do need places to deposit their eggs. Every butterfly species has a plant or group of plants that their caterpillars will eat, known as host plants. The best way to attract a wider variety of butterflies is to provide the host plants they need. Just remember that the purpose of these plants is to feed caterpillars, so the plants will get chewed up and defoliated. For once, holes in the leaves mean gardeners are doing something right!
To determine the best host plants for your garden, start by finding out which butterflies are regular visitors to your area. Once again, extension offices or local butterfly gardens are a great source of information. Then start seeking out the host plants these butterflies need. They are almost always native plants, and more often than not, they’re what others might consider weeds. No good butterfly garden can do without them, though, so choose those that best suit your site and plant as many as you possibly can.
Host plants vary by area, but nearly anyone can plant milkweed for monarchs, hollyhocks for painted ladies and violets for great spangled fritillaries. Some butterfly and moth caterpillars use trees, too, so if you have space, consider adding ash or willow for tiger swallowtails and mourning cloaks.
To get the most out of your butterfly garden, observe the space at different times of day. In the morning, butterflies are a little slow to get started, especially if the air is cooler, so it’s a wonderful time to take photos. Sunny afternoons bring out butterflies in high numbers, and evenings are the time to enjoy beautiful moths. Take time to hunt for caterpillars, too, and buy a good field guide to learn what to look for. Most of all, find a little time each day to sit quietly and watch your winged visitors come and go.

 Gardening for Bees and Other Insects
In order to create a yard that’s safe and attractive to native bees, it’s important to understand these fascinating creatures. A few of their behaviors might surprise you, and knowing these things will help you grow a garden fit for these powerful pollinators.
First and foremost, you might not even realize they’re there. Native bees can look different from how we often visualize these flying insects. They actually exist in an array of colors, including metallic green, brown, black and gray, as well as the stereotypical yellow-and-black stripes. Native bees can be quite small and are often mistaken for flies. It’s also useful to note that native bees tend to be docile. Most bees cannot sting humans.
Another common misconception about bees is where they nest. Most solitary bee species nest in the ground; the rest use tunnels like hollow stems or burrow into dead wood. Inside these nesting sites, the female bee creates a pollen loaf, lays a single egg on it, then starts a new nesting site and repeats the process. To create a safe habitat for this type of nesting, it’s essential to have areas of undisturbed, loose ground. Bees tend to select south-facing slopes with well-drained soil, which can be warmer and drier, and make for good nesting sites. If you genuinely want to attract nesting bees, think about forgoing mulch. A lot of native bees are too small to get through the mulch layer.

When cutting back your plants in fall, leave behind foot-long lengths of pithy or hollow stems for the tunnel nesters. Cavity-nesting bees will also use those stems the next year. You can also create natural bee houses by bundling together hollow stems and hanging them in the yard. Fallen wood, brush piles or old fence posts also provide good nesting sites.
You know the term “busy bee?” Well, it couldn’t be more true—native bees are extremely busy. Most female native bees are active as adults for two to six weeks. During that time, they are collecting pollen to create as many loaves and lay as many eggs as possible. To make foraging for pollen less arduous, provide a diverse selection of flowers from spring to fall and plant them in groups.
New generations and different species of bees are emerging throughout the growing season and it’s essential that they have enough flowers for pollen collection. Gardeners should identify flowering gaps during the growing season and add plants to the yard accordingly, so that bees can get a continuous succession of flowering plants.
A Bee or Not a Bee?
Just because it buzzes doesn’t mean it’s a bee. You may be surprised to learn just how many other garden bugs masquerade as bees, including moths, beetles and the real masters of disguise, flies. Although usually considered pests, flies are big allies in the yard and garden. These bee look-alikes really are good bugs for your garden.
The most common bee mimics are the hoverflies, members of the Syrphidae family, which resemble small bees or wasps like yellow jackets. Some even sound like wasps, with the frequency of their wing beats matching that of their stinging counterparts. They are garden friendly, helping to pollinate flowers and eat aphids.
The Asilidae family’s robber flies are excellent mimics of bumblebees. Instead of visiting flowers, they perch on foliage, twigs or the ground, and then scan the sky overhead. When another insect flies over, the robber fly zooms off to grab the victim and then returns to its perch. This fly family also helps control some of the less desirable garden insects.
Bee flies, sometimes called “wanna-bees,” are in the Bombyliidae family. Their hairy bodies are delicate and can go bald quickly during their brief lives as adults. Many bee flies have a long proboscis that looks much like a mosquito’s bloodsucking snout. No worries, though—bee flies are harmless and feed on flower nectar.
Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees



Solitary bee

Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees
Feather-legged flies in the Tachinidae family really take their disguise to the next level with fake pollen baskets on their hind legs. As adults, they may pollinate flowers; as larvae, they are parasitic on stinkbugs and squash bugs. These flies are certainly good bugs for your garden!
So, after all of that, how do you tell if it’s a bee or a fly? Look for these characteristics and don’t be afraid to get close. Foraging bees are too intent on what they’re doing to bother with you, and flies have no stingers at all.
Wings: Bees have two pairs of wings, whereas flies have only one set. But since the forewings and hind wings of bees are usually connected, they may appear to have only one pair.
Antennae: Bees have relatively long antennae. Most flies have very short antennae, with a long bristle called an arista at the tip.
Eyes: Both bees and flies have compound eyes that excel at detecting motion, which is why it’s so hard to swat them. But flies, unlike bees, have enormous eyes that meet at the top of the head in the male, and nearly so in the female.
Mouthparts: Bees have chewing mouthparts and a tonguelike proboscis. Flies have a spongy pad at the end of a flexible “arm,” or a spearlike beak.
Behavior: Few bees hover, at least for extended periods. Many flies seem to be able to hover indefinitely.

Bee Garden Basics
When gardening for bees, here are a few general rules of thumb:
• Choose a range of flower shapes and colors to attract the most bee species. Bumblebees can easily collect pollen from complex flowers, while smaller bees appreciate simple flower shapes and a flat place to land.
• Plant season-long blooms to support bees from early spring until fall.
• Provide areas of undisturbed ground or vegetation for nesting sites.
• Bees and flowers have evolved in tandem, so make sure to choose nonhybrid natives.
• Plant in masses for efficient pollen collection. Sunny areas are most attractive.
• Avoid pesticide use. Even some organic mixtures can harm insects.
• Provide a muddy area or shallow trough for water.

BACHELOR’S BUTTON
Centaurea cyanus

Growing best in full sun, bachelor’s button comes in several colors, including blue, pink, red, white and purple. Though considered an annual, its seeds ensure a new crop each year. Butterflies will visit for nectar, and in fall, finches, buntings and sparrows will stop by to nibble from the seed heads. Also known as cornflower, this charmer is long-lasting when cut and holds its color when dried.

BEGONIA
Begonia spp., Annual to Zone 10

For a metallic-leafed begonia, like Metallic Mist, look to the Rex and rhizomatous varieties. This shade-lover adds hints of silver to borders and hanging baskets.

BORAGE
Borago officinalis

The clear blue star-shaped flowers of borage stand out in the garden. You can eat the cucumber-flavored leaves raw, steamed or sautéed. This annual self-seeds, so it will be a long-lasting member of the garden. And you will have plenty of seedlings to share with family and friends!

DID YOU KNOW?
Borage is not only pretty, but it’s a great plant for dry areas.

CALENDULA
Calendula officinalis

You may also know this edible flower as pot marigold. The yellowish white and orange petals were once used to flavor soups and stews. Grow in full sun with moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in cooler temperatures.

CALIBRACHOA
Calibrachoa spp.

Its small petunialike flowers will steal the show all season, making fast-growing calibrachoa a hot choice for beds and containers—especially those that are geared toward butterflies and hummingbirds. Use it as a nicely textured filler plant or as a bold stand-alone. Plants reach about 8 inches tall and spread to about 1 foot wide.

CARROT
Daucus carota var. sativus

It’s not the crunchy orange spikes that entice black swallowtail caterpillars, it’s the tops. Plant the tiny seeds in loose, well-draining soil for best results—and if you want long, straight carrots, be sure the soil is rock-free, too.

CELOSIA
Celosia argentea

This velvety favorite doesn’t mind heat, so get it going in summer and it will last well into autumn. Available in shades of red, purple, orange and yellow, celosia plants have two different types of flower heads: feathered and spiky, or wavy and flat. The latter resembles a rooster’s comb, hence this long-lasting flower’s other name, cockscomb. Celosia can thrive in a wide range of soils, including heavy clay.

CLEOME
Cleome hassleriana

Plant this tropical native in your garden and you’re sure to attract attention. This bloom, which some call spider flower, is a top nectar source for swallowtail butterflies and hummingbirds. Cleome’s tall stems, topped by wispy pink, purple or white flowers, are hard to miss. Plants tend to reseed themselves from one year to the next if goldfinches don’t get to them first!

COSMOS
Cosmos spp.

Throughout the growing season, birds and butterflies can’t resist these colorful, pinwheel-shaped blossoms with feathery foliage. Grow single or double cultivars of this easygoing bloomer in full sun, and you’ll have flowers and seeds from summer through late fall. Plants stand from 1 to 6 feet high, so no matter how large your space, there’s a type of cosmos that will fit right in.

DILL
Anethum graveolens

Don’t be surprised if you see black swallowtails flitting among dill’s green fronds. This herb is a larval host plant. In summer and fall, yellow blooms open on broad flower heads. At 3 to 4 feet tall, dill sometimes needs to be staked. It thrives in well-draining, sandy or loamy soil.

FENNEL
Foeniculum vulgare

With a dill-like top and stems that resemble celery, you could assume fennel tastes like a cross between the two. Nope! Instead, think licorice. Attractive to butterflies and other beneficial insects, as well as songbirds, fennel reaches about 3 feet tall and prefers rich, well-draining soil.

FLOSS FLOWER
Ageratum houstonianum

Floss flower’s fuzzy clusters make soft landing pads for hungry butterflies. This fast-growing plant, also known as ageratum, is common in sunny garden borders and containers thanks to its compact size: a petite 6 to 12 inches. Purple, pink, blue or white blooms beckon fliers-by.

FLOWERING TOBACCO
Nicotiana spp.

For a no-fuss way to liven up your garden, plant flowering tobacco! Ranging from 10 inches to 5 feet high, the stems are covered with star-shaped flowers in shades of red, maroon, lavender, white, pink, yellow and even green. Some types, including members of the N. sylvestris species, have a lovely scent, especially in the evening.

FOUR-O’CLOCKS
Mirabilis jalapa, Annual to Zone 10

Almost like clockwork, this often fragrant flower blooms in late afternoon. Each blossom lives for just one day, fading before noon. Flowers are available in yellow, pink, purple, red, white and lavender—sometimes on the same plant. Additional varieties, like the Jingles mix, are striped.

FUCHSIA
Fuchsia spp., Annual to Zone 8

Fuchsia’s showy, pendulous red, white, pink and purple blooms will capture your heart. There are more than 100 kinds, from low-growing dwarfs and trailing plants to upright shrubs. Fuchsia grows best in moist soil and partial shade, so it’s ideal for attracting hummingbirds to less-than-sunny yards. Fertilize weekly for best results.

GERANIUM
Pelargonium

It’s up for debate, but the geranium may be known and loved by more people than any other flower in the world. The plant’s vivid colors and long-lasting blossoms make it a favorite for backyards everywhere, flowering from summer to frost. Multicolored Peppermint Twist is eye-catching. If you’d rather have a solid, the Orbit series has a glowing red variety.

DID YOU KNOW?
You can enjoy geraniums indoors, too! Snip off some blooms and add them to your own flower bouquet.

HELIOTROPE
Heliotropium arborescens

Heliotrope’s fruity scent has earned it the nickname cherry pie. Its compact growth habit and profuse purplish blooms make it a good choice for containers and flower beds. Plants reach 2 feet tall and up to 15 inches wide. Watch yours for all types of butterflies, from blues to monarchs.

IMPATIENS
Impatiens spp.

Invite winged creatures into the shade with impatiens. Sparrows, finches, grosbeaks and buntings eat the seeds, while hummingbirds and butterflies drop in for a sip of nectar. Growing 6 inches to 2 feet high, impatiens has a mounding growth habit, making it a good choice for borders, foundation beds and containers.

LANTANA
Lantana camara, Annual to Zone 9

With its abundant clusters of tiny, nectar-rich flowers, why wouldn’t hummingbirds and butterflies, including swallowtails and hairstreaks, love lantana? Later in the growing season, birds nibble its berries, as well. In more tropical climates, lantana is grown as a shrub and can become invasive. With a mounding or trailing habit, smaller varieties work well in containers.

MARIGOLD
Tagetes spp.

A tough yet easygoing plant, this old-fashioned favorite flowers all summer. With many bloom styles and heights to choose from, you’re bound to find the perfect marigold for any sunny space. The Queen Sophia cultivar sports two shades of orange on each ruffly bloom.

MEXICAN BUSH SAGE
Salvia leucantha, Annual to Zone 8

Butterflies and hummingbirds will be clamoring for a space at this plant’s late-blooming purplish flowers. In areas where this sage is hardy, it can be established as a shrub. In cooler zones, plant it outdoors as soon as the threat of frost has passed: It needs a long growing season. No matter where you live, grow Mexican bush sage in full sun with moist yet well-draining soil.

MEXICAN SUNFLOWER
Tithonia rotundifolia

This fast-growing annual, which blooms in late summer and autumn, reaches 6 feet in height. Its long-lasting orange and red flowers glow in full sun. For smaller spaces, try a compact variety such as Goldfinger or Fiesta Del Sol. Resist the urge to deadhead—songbirds enjoy the seeds.

NASTURTIUM
Tropaeolum spp.

Humans aren’t the only ones who enjoy nasturtiums: Moth and butterfly caterpillars like to munch on its leaves, as do some songbirds. The nectar attracts many types of fliers. Once it’s established, nasturtium performs best when left alone, contributing vivid color all season long. Some types grow in mounds, while others are good climbers.

PANSY
Viola x wittrockiana

This colorful flower is best known for the whiskered “faces” that mark many of the blooms. The majority of pansies are annuals, though some live longer. Most perform best in cooler weather, so in warm climates they’re valued for bringing much-needed color to dull winter landscapes.

PARSLEY
Petroselinum crispum

It’s a must for herb gardens and butterfly gardens, too, since parsley is a host plant for the black swallowtail. With curly or flat leaves, it prefers cooler temperatures and grows best in full sun and slightly acidic soil.

Verbena bonariensis, Annual to Zone 7

Entice fall-flying butterflies with these delicate, long-stemmed purple flowers. People will take notice, too. This plant can grow up to 5 feet tall. Check with your local extension office before planting because it’s invasive in some areas.

SALVIA

SNAPDRAGON
Antirrhinum majus

Despite the intimidating name, butterflies (including common buckeye caterpillars) love the snapdragon. It’s easily recognized by its distinctive overlapping petals, which come in appealing hues of pink, red, yellow, orange, white, purple and bronze, plus bicolors. Though it usually blooms throughout the growing season, snapdragon is most floriferous when temperatures are cooler.

SUNFLOWER
Helianthus annuus

There’s something about a sunflower’s bright face that simply makes you feel good. And when it comes to kids, few plants cause more excitement than these towering blooms, which can soar up to 15 feet!

SWEET PEA
Lathyrus odoratus

This fragrant flower is easy to grow and provides flowers for cutting all season long.

AGASTACHE
Agastache spp., Zones 4 to 11

Bushy and studded with blooms from mid- to late summer, agastache is a favorite of hummingbirds, butterflies and bees. Flower spires in violet, orange, yellow, pink or blue reach 2 to 6 feet high. Agastache thrives in full sun and in well-draining, fertile soil.

ALLIUM
Allium spp., Zones 2 to 10

Looking to add a colorful bounce to your garden? There’s no better bloomer than allium! This pretty perennial is a winning selection, available in shades of purple, pink, white and yellow. Not only can you find an allium to suit nearly any spot, this enchanting plant is easy to grow, and different species bloom from midspring until fall.

ALPINE SPEEDWELL
Veronica allionii, Zones 2 to 9

Like its larger cousins, this compact speedwell features chubby spikes that flower over an olive-green cushion of foliage. Because it’s a low grower, you’ll find it works wonderfully in feature spots like borders.

ANISE HYSSOP
Agastache foeniculum, Zones 4 to 11

This North American native produces spikes of blue flowers above anise-scented leaves in late summer. The plants grow 3 feet tall, self-seed and tolerate drought once they’re established. Be sure to deadhead to encourage more blooms.

APPLE
Malus spp., Zones 3 to 8

The apple is cultivated across North America for its pretty spring flowers and tasty late-season fruit. It’s a host to the white admiral. Grosbeaks nibble the flower buds and robins, thrushes and others flock for the fruit. It prefers moist but well-draining soil and full sun.

ASTER

Aster spp., Zones 3 to 8
A popular cut flower, the aster incites an explosion of color to the end of the growing season. From miniature alpine plants to giants that tower up to 6 feet, asters will brighten fall, especially when the late-season butterflies come to visit. Hundreds of varieties give gardeners plenty of options.

ASTILBE
Astilbe spp., Zones 4 to 9

Its fernlike appearance helps astilbe fit right into a shade garden—though its flower spikes, which grow from about 1 to 4 feet tall, can’t help but steal the spotlight. For a touch of glamour, try Bridal Veil. From afar, the flowers on this and some other astilbe varieties look like feathers.

BAPTISIA

Baptisia spp., Zones 3 to 9
In early summer, this North American native’s stems are laden with small flowers that later form structural seed heads sought after by birds. Select from a variety of colors, cultivars and hybrids to find the perfect plant for your space. Plant baptisia with ample room in a place where you won’t have to move it: It develops a deep taproot and is finicky about being transplanted.

BEE BALM
Monarda spp., Zones 3 to 9

Also known as bergamot, this unusual beauty grows up to 4 feet tall and starts flowering in midsummer, inviting hummingbirds, butterflies and bees to your flower bed. Plants come in hues of pinkx, red, white and purple; choose mildew-resistant varieties for best results. Frequent deadheading will keep this enthusiastic self-sower in check, but then you won’t see songbirds stopping to eat the seeds once petals die back. The choice is yours!

DID YOU KNOW?
Plants like bee balm, bachelor’s button and cosmos not only lure helpful insects that will prey upon damaging insects, but also attract pollinators.

BELLFLOWER
Campanula spp., Zones 3 to 9

This dainty plant, available in annual, perennial and biennial cultivars, enjoys moist soil and thrives in full sun to partial shade. In late spring and early summer, it unveils bell-shaped flowers in colors ranging from blue to purple to white. Some varieties, like the Serbian bellflower, have long-lasting blooms and evergreen foliage in Zones 8 and 9.

BLACK-EYED SUSAN
Rudbeckia spp., Zones 3 to 9

Lovely as a background planting or in a wildflower garden, black-eyed Susan also shines when grouped with other daisy-shaped flowers. Plants range from 1 to 6 feet in height, offering a big visual impact in any size yard. Birds love the late-fall seed heads.

BLANKET FLOWER
Gaillardia spp., Zones 3 to 10

Not only is blanket flower bright and cheery, it’s one tough plant. Tolerant of drought and a variety of soil conditions, this North American native, sometimes grown as an annual, is a standout in any sunny spot. At the end of the growing season, you can save and dry the seeds and plant them the following spring.

BLAZING STAR
Liatris spp., Zones 3 to 9

The nectar of this spiky plant is a butterfly favorite, especially when it comes to the silver-spotted skipper. After the flowers fade, birds favor the seeds, which are easy to pick out in the garden—plants reach up to 6 feet tall! Some types, like Kobold, are much shorter, measuring roughly 18 inches.


BLEEDING HEART
Dicentra spectabilis, Zones 3 to 9

Give life to a shady spot by planting a few of these delicate perennials. Long-lasting blooms open in midspring, covering this graceful plant with gorgeous floral pendants in shades of rose pink and creamy white. Watch for a hummingbird or two hovering nearby.

BLUEBERRY
Vaccinium spp., Zones 3 to 10

Producing bell-shaped white flowers in spring and plump, flavorful fruits in summer, this shrub supplies food for butterflies, birds, small mammals and humans. The blueberry is a plant for all seasons. Green leaves turn to orange or red in autumn, and the bright stems are attractive through winter. Just be sure to select a species suited for your region.

BUTTERFLY WEED
Asclepias tuberosa, Zones 3 to 9

Not solely a treat for butterflies, this drought-tolerant plant is a wildlife garden must-have. Its foliage is the food of larval monarch and queen butterflies, while hummingbirds love the flat-topped flower clusters’ nectar and birds, such as goldfinches and orioles, use the silky down of spent seed pods as nesting material. Despite its name, it’s far from being a pest.

CARDINAL FLOWER
Lobelia cardinalis, Zones 3 to 9

A moisture-loving favorite, bright-red cardinal flower grows 3 to 5 feet tall and blooms for most of summer and into autumn. It does well when planted in full sun to partial shade and fertile, moist soil. Hummingbirds and butterflies (especially those in the swallowtail family) seek out this plant’s nectar, but don’t expect to see cardinals hanging around nearby—the flower is named merely for the color.

CANDYTUFT
Iberis sempervirens, Zones 5 to 9

Roll out the white carpet for your garden with this dense mat of pale blooms perfect for borders, rock gardens or containers. Clusters of flowers bloom from spring into summer, leaving candytuft’s evergreen foliage to maintain interest all year through.

CATMINT
Nepeta x faassenii, Zones 3 to 8

Don’t let the name sway you from planting this bee favorite. Look for well-behaved varieties that do not reseed and take over the garden. You and the bees will be rewarded with blue flowers that top silvery foliage all season long.

CHRYSANTHEMUM
Chrysanthemum and Dendranthema, Zones 4 to 8

Mum’s the word for many gardeners in autumn, and with good reason. The chrysanthemum is prized for painting landscapes with dense, vivid color, and its excellent frost tolerance ensures a long and lovely show. When planted in spring or summer, this shrubby tender perennial is often called a hardy mum, because it has time to become established. Planted in fall, mums are grown as annuals.

COLUMBINE
Aquilegia spp., Zones 3 to 9

Blooming exuberantly from spring to early summer, columbine’s distinctive flowers come in a wide spectrum of solids and bicolors, boasting single or double sets of petals. Plants range from 8 inches to 3 feet high. Watch for all sorts of pollinators, plus the aptly named columbine duskywing butterfly, which uses this as a host plant.

BACKYARD TIP
Hummingbirds can’t resist columbine’s distinctly shaped blooms. And as one of the easiest wildflowers to cultivate, it’s a great addition to backyards.

COMMON BUGLEWEED
Ajuga reptans, Zones 3 to 9

This evergreen perennial makes an excellent ground cover with its masses of bronze, green or variegated foliage. Columns of blue or pink flowers appear in spring and early summer, inviting butterflies and newly arrived hummingbirds to sip its nectar. Deer-resistant bugleweed is an aggressive grower and may invade lawns, so plant yours within a barrier. On the upside, you won’t have to wait long for it to fill in after planting!

CONEFLOWER
Echinacea spp., Zones 3 to 9

Birds, bees and butterflies, such as fritillaries, truly love this perennial! You’ll see songbirds pause to nibble the seeds, and butterflies and hummers stopping for its nectar into fall. In winter, the remaining seed heads leave an interesting garden focal point.

COREOPSIS
Coreopsis spp., Zones 3 to 11

Though you can find annual varieties of this graceful plant that’s easy to grow from seed, make sure you pick up one of the perennial versions, too. It loves the sun and grows well in dry conditions. A rainbow of new varieties offers striking alternatives to the traditional yellow blooms. Plants range from 8 to 48 inches in height. After the butterfly-attracting flowers fade, songbirds eat the seeds.

CREEPING PHLOX
Phlox subulata, Zones 3 to 8

Topping off at just 6 inches, creeping phlox is a smaller, mat-forming relative of the familiar fragrant perennial. When it blooms in spring, it forms a carpet of pretty little blossoms that entice passing butterflies. When nestled into a protective layer of mulch, creeping phlox doesn’t require much watering.

CROCOSMIA
Crocosmia spp., Zones 5 to 9

This dramatic hummingbird magnet reaches 3 feet high, unfurling wiry stems of bright blossoms from mid- to late summer. Moist soil is important for optimal flowering. Crocosmia makes an excellent cut flower and adds tropical flair to any space, outdoors or in. But be warned: It’s invasive in some areas.

DAHLIA
Dahlia spp., Zones 8 to 11

It’s no wonder the dahlia is the darling of many gardeners. With thousands of cultivars out there, there are colors, shapes and sizes for everyone. Some varieties easily surpass 5 feet, and the flowers grow as big as dinner plates. Gardeners in cooler climates should dig up the tubers once the plants have died back after frost arrives.

DAYLILY
Hemerocallis, Zones 3 to 10

This summer bloomer is cherished for its reliability and variety. With many thousands of cultivars available, gardeners have almost limitless options. Though the blossoms last just a day, you’ll find many hybrids that flower repeatedly all season long.

DELPHINIUM
Delphinium, Zones 3 to 7

This towering treasure makes a statement at the back of a mixed border, as a vertical accent or in a container. With dozens of blooms on each stem, it gives hummingbirds plenty of nectar sources to share with butterflies and other bugs, too.

DIANTHUS
Dianthus, Zones 3 to 10

One of the world’s oldest cultivated flowers, dianthus is prized for its ruffled petals, pleasant scent and generous spring and summer blooming period. Ranging from just 4 inches to 36 inches high, dianthus grows well in full sun.

EVENING PRIMROSE
Oenothera, Zones 3 to 9

A good choice for poor or dry soil, warm tones of this spring to summer bloomer attract hummers best. Typically, plants reach heights of 2 to 3 feet and may need support.

EVERLASTING
Anaphalis margaritacea, Zones 3 to 8

Maybe you’re more familiar with this plant by its common name pearly everlasting, but its beauty is the same no matter what you call it. Blooming from midsummer to early fall, this plant boasts small, flat-topped clumps of white flowers reaching about 2 feet tall.

FORGET-ME-NOT
Myosotis sylvatica, Zones 3 to 9

Early-season butterflies remember to visit these dainty blooms, which range from the classic blue to white and pink. Though forget-me-not is considered a biennial, it produces a lot of seeds, making it a smart self-sowing ground cover. Do a little research before planting forget-me-nots because it’s invasive in some areas.

FOXGLOVE
Digitalis spp., Zones 3 to 10

With 18-inch to 6-foot spires covered with bright, bell-shaped blooms, this showy plant can’t be missed. Self-seeding foxglove is a biennial or short-lived perennial, so leave the spent flowers in place and you’ll be treated to a new crop of blooms each spring.

GARDEN PHLOX
Phlox paniculata, Zones 3 to 8

People love the sweet fragrance of this charming classic, but butterflies and hummingbirds visit for the nectar. A tough, reliable plant, garden phlox blooms all summer with a little deadheading. Grow this pretty plant, which can reach up to 3 feet tall, in full sun, and water regularly.

GLOBE THISTLE
Echinops ritro, Zones 3 to 9

Butterflies will be anything but blue when you plant this spiny-looking azure beauty in your garden. Standing up to 2 feet tall, globe thistle, also known as blue hedgehog, grows best in poor but well-draining soil and full sun. Butterflies, bees and moths relish the nectar, and once seed heads form, finches and other birds will stop by to eat.

GOLDENROD
Solidago spp., Zones 3 to 9

Light up your autumn garden with goldenrod’s wispy yellow blooms, which also make long-lasting cut flowers. Choose a type that’s not an aggressive self-seeder, such as Fireworks. That way, you won’t have to deadhead as often, and the birds will have fortifying seeds to eat when the weather cools.

GRAPE HYACINTH
Muscari, Zones 3 to 9

A hardy spring bulb, grape hyacinth sports cobalt-hued flowers resembling tiny grapes. This plant easily spreads to form a sea of fragrant blue blooms.

HOLLYHOCK
Alcea rosea, Zones 3 to 9

If you want to make an impact in your garden, look no further than this tall host plant to butterfly larvae, including hairstreaks, skippers and painted ladies. It comes in many colors, attracts a variety of insects and hummingbirds and can reach up to 8 feet tall. Hollyhock is a biennial, so it grows foliage on short stems its first year but doesn’t flower until the next. From then on, it self-seeds.

HOSTA
Hosta, Zones 3 to 8

The ultimate low-care shade plant, hosta comes in endless varieties and colors. It also can be easily divided—perfect for the budget-minded. Hosta forms a dense, leafy clump, with blossoms rising up to 3 feet above the foliage. Thousands of cultivars offer a wide array of leaf colors, shapes, patterns and textures. While some hostas tolerate sun, those grown in partial shade generally produce the most handsome, longest-lasting foliage.

JAPANESE ANEMONE
Anemone x hybrida, Zones 4 to 8

Well suited to sun or partial shade, the Japanese anemone produces saucer-shaped white or pink flowers throughout the season. Be sure the site you choose to plant it has moist, humus-rich soil and gets some sun. A fine choice for autumn, it thrives in cool, damp conditions.

JOE PYE WEED
Eupatorium spp., Zones 3 to 11

A sun-loving, sky-high perennial that needs no staking, this native wildflower is a showstopper when its giant puffs of mauve florets come into bloom. You can find varieties for smaller spaces, too, such as Little Joe and Gateway.

LAMBS’ EARS
Stachys byzantina, Zones 4 to 8

Easily recognized by its woolly, silvery-gray foliage, lambs’ ears is a trusty bedding plant and ground cover that also makes a wonderful companion plant. Standing about 18 inches tall, lambs’ ears thrives in full sun to partial shade. You can’t go wrong with its long growing season: early summer to frost.

LAVENDER
Lavandula spp., Zones 5 to 10

In the summertime, hummingbirds, skippers, painted ladies and other pollinators frequently visit lavender. You’ll love this Mediterranean bloomer for its attractive flower spires, silvery-green foliage and calming scent. Varieties of this flower grow from 1 to 4 feet tall, and are available in many shades of purple as well as white and light pink.

LUNGWORT
Pulmonaria spp., Zones 2 to 8

A popular early nectar source for hummingbirds, lungwort’s blue, purple, pink or white blooms and dappled leaves lend interest to shady backyards. The foliage often remains green clear into winter, making this plant an all-season asset. Most cultivars are about 12 inches tall and thrive in moist, well-draining soil.

LUPINE
Lupinus spp., Zones 3 to 8

Give your backyard a bit of rustic charm by planting a stand of lupines. With colors and sizes that suit any garden, varieties range from native species to new hybrids.

NEW YORK IRONWEED
Vernonia noveboracensis, Zones 5 to 9

This North American native blooms in August and September on sturdy, statuesque stems. The adaptable, sun-loving perennial flourishes in any moist to normal soil.

ORIENTAL POPPY
Papaver orientale, Zones 2 to 9

This plant can be difficult to grow, since it doesn’t handle transplanting well and requires a sunny site with adequately draining soil. But the oriental poppy’s vibrant, papery blooms are worth the effort. In the right location, this exotic-looking flower fills in quickly and rewards gardeners with years of enjoyment.

PASQUE FLOWER
Pulsatilla vulgaris, Zones 4 to 8

An early-spring bloomer, pasque flower adds an element of texture to any garden. While it’s likely not a go-to perennial for most gardeners, we think this drought-tolerant, fuss-free flower certainly deserves top honors and some attention.

PEAR
Pyrus communis, Zones 3 to 9

A pear tree is a pretty and practical addition to a wildlife garden. Reaching up to 50 feet tall, this tree has lovely spring blooms and autumn foliage. Many types of butterflies—anglewings and admirals—and birds enjoy the fruit.

PENSTEMON
Penstemon spp., Zones 3 to 10

Hummingbirds favor this spiky trumpet-shaped flower, which comes in pink, red, purple, blue and white. Varieties reach heights of up to 4 feet and bloom profusely for most or all of the summer. Full sun and well-draining soil, including the sandy stuff, are ideal.

PINKROOT
Spigelia marilandica, Zones 5 to 9

Hummers will be especially grateful when you add pinkroot to your garden. A rugged and handsome wildflower of modest size—from 1 to 2 feet tall and wide—it blooms from late spring to early summer. The spiky tube-shaped flowers are bright pink and yellow.

RED-HOT POKER
Kniphofia spp., Zones 4 to 9

Terrific in mixed flower borders or small groupings, torchlike red-hot poker plants grow up to 4 feet high and deliver bright plumes of orange, red, yellow, white and green. For best results, well-draining soil is important; the roots will rot in boggy conditions. Nectaring birds and swallowtails love it.

ROCK CRESS
Arabis caucasica, Zones 4 to 8

Add some springtime fragrance to your garden with this delicate bloomer. Rock cress prefers dry soil and full sun. Give this short-and-sweet ground cover a haircut after it’s finished blooming to help it fill out and look tidier for the rest of the growing season.

SEDUM
Sedum spp., Zones 3 to 10

Many cultivars of this late-season favorite boast bold-hued foliage, ranging from red to purple to gold.

STRAWBERRY
Fragaria spp., Zones 2 to 11

This sweet treat will bring lots of fliers to your yard. Plants have various growing habits, so choose the one that’s right for you. Just remember that you won’t be able to harvest the fruit until the second growing season. The wait will be worth it!

SWAMP MILKWEED
Asclepias incarnata, Zones 3 to 9

A fragrant nectar and host plant, swamp milkweed is a top performer in moist soil. Less pushy than common milkweed, this 3- to 5-foot native blooms in white or pink.

SWEET WILLIAM

A biennial beauty, sweet William tends to grow to about 2 feet tall, but dwarf varieties are easy to come by, as well. Each flower-packed stem makes a complete bouquet!

TULIP
Tulipa, Zones 4 to 8

Few flowers announce the arrival of a season the way the tulip does. Available in many sizes, blooming rates and colors, the tulip is the most popular bulb in the world. Why the narrow hardiness area? Most require a long winter to bloom. In warmer areas, you can force tulip bulbs by chilling them in the fridge for eight to 10 weeks before planting.

TURTLEHEAD
Chelone spp., Zones 3 to 9

Bring life to partly shady areas with this distinctive fall butterfly magnet. Pink, purple or white flowers bloom on spikes that grow from 16 to 40 inches high. This native plant thrives in moist soil, so it’s an ideal addition to a bog garden.

VIOLET
Viola, Zones 3 to 10

VIRGINIA BLUEBELLS
Mertensia virginica, Zones 3 to 8

With its sprays of nodding, dainty, bell-shaped flowers, this perennial adds sophistication to any garden. Plant this 1- to 2- foot charmer alongside summertime bloomers whose foliage will cover the spent wildflower. Despite its name, you’ll also find Virginia bluebells in pink and white.

BLUE OAT GRASS
Helictotrichon sempervirens, Zones 4 to 8

Planted in a border or container, or used as a stand-alone accent, blue oat grass makes a big statement.

BIGLEAF MAPLE
Acer macrophyllum, Zones 5 to 7

Even if you don’t believe bigger is always better, check out this tree, which boasts the largest leaves of any maple—each is up to a foot wide! A year-round winner for wildlife, bigleaf maple attracts bugs that feed migrating and local birds, produces edible seeds and flowers in spring and, at 70 feet tall and wide, offers lots of protection for nesting and roosting. It’s a host for the western tiger swallowtail, too.

BLACK CHOKEBERRY
Aronia melanocarpa, Zones 3 to 9

A lovely and low-maintenance shrub all year, this chokeberry develops bluish-black fruit that songbirds eat in fall and winter. Butterflies like the spring flowers, and some coral hairstreaks use it as a host. Plants grow 3 to 6 feet tall and up to 10 feet wide. They thrive in full sun or part shade and moist, well-draining soil.

BLUE SPIREA
Caryopteris spp., Zones 5 to 9

Add some cool hues to your landscape, and you’ll be seeing butterflies in no time. Blue spirea’s tiers of blue or purple florets make this a late-summer all-star. Most types of this shrub are about 3-1/2 feet tall and 5 feet wide and grow best in light, well-draining soil in full sun or light shade.

BOXWOOD
Buxus spp., Zones 5 to 9

A top choice among landscapers for hedges and topiaries, this evergreen is covered in masses of green or variegated foliage and thrives in sites with partial shade. Because its structure is so dense, it offers ample protection to winter songbirds. Many slow-growing cultivars reach just 5 feet.

BUTTERFLY BUSH
Buddleja davidii, Zones 5 to 9

A top nectar plant for many winged species, heat- and drought-tolerant butterfly bush grows up to 15 feet tall. The arching branches are tipped with tiny purple, white, pink or yellow blooms from midsummer through frost. It’s invasive in some areas, but noninvasive species are available.

BUTTONBUSH
Cephalanthus occidentalis, Zones 5 to 10

Round white flower heads with needlelike protrusions make honey-sweet buttonbush unmistakable. Shrubs are generally about 6 feet tall but occasionally far surpass that. Consistently moist soil is a must; downright wet soil, a plus.

Tips for Growing Shrubs
1. Water a newly planted shrub thoroughly to help settle the soil. Add enough water to moisten the top 6 to 12 inches of soil.
2. After that, shrubs need thorough, but much less frequent watering.
3. Apply a layer of mulch around new plantings. This helps conserve moisture and moderate soil temperatues.

Our feathered friends love the thick branches and prickly needles that offer winter shelter, whether it’s from stormy weather or nearby predators. Blue spruce cones also produce seed for food. This tree does best in full sun and grows up to 60 feet tall, but dwarf cultivars are readily available, as well.

COMMON ALDER
Alnus glutinosa, Zones 3 to 7

If your yard is plagued by wet or just plain poor soil, consider planting common alder. Migratory birds eat the bugs on the late-winter and early-spring catkins, and winter birds eat the seeds in the cones. Eventually reaching 80 feet high and 30 feet wide, the common alder also offers plenty of shelter. Before planting, ensure that it isn’t invasive in your area.

COMMON BEARBERRY
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Zones 2 to 6

Rocky and sandy soils are best for this hardy, low-growing evergreen ground cover, making it a good choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Bearberry, also known as kinnikinick, produces tiny white or pink flowers in spring and summer, and long-lasting bright-red berries in fall. It’s also a host plant to some elfins and fritillaries.

COMMON CHOKECHERRY
Prunus virginiana, Zones 2 to 7

An ideal addition to a protective thicket for both butterflies and birds, chokecherry grows 20 to 30 feet high and wide. It produces clusters of pink or white flowers in spring and red berries that deepen to purple by late summer.

CORALBERRY

Whether they’re deciduous, evergreen or semi-evergreen shrubs or trees, cotoneasters sport red and orange berries that songbirds love. They grow in full sun to partial shade in fertile, well-draining soil and range from 1 to 15 feet tall. In summer, you may notice butterflies sampling nectar from the white flowers.

CRABAPPLE
Malus spp., Zones 3 to 9

Everyone loves crabapple’s lightly fragrant white, pink to rosy-red spring flowers, but consider the colorful fruit, too, when choosing one. Look for fire blight- and scab-resistant varieties to increase the beauty and reduce maintenance.

CRAPE MYRTLE
Lagerstroemia indica, Zones 7 to 9

Crape myrtle is a year-round belle in the South, where it thrives in the warmth and blooms from July to September. The spectacular flowers won’t stop attracting butterflies, bees and hummingbirds. You can even remove the first wave of flowers to encourage a second bloom. Grow this heat-tolerant beauty in full sun, and it might get to be 10 feet or more.

DOGWOOD
Cornus spp., Zones 2 to 8

Want a wildlife garden showstopper? Look no further. These berry-rich garden favorites feed robins, bluebirds, cardinals and dozens of other backyard birds during cold months.

EASTERN ARBORVITAE
Thuja occidentalis, Zones 3 to 7

This tree is dense, with a pyramidal shape and clusters of small seed-bearing cones. It has a classic conifer look (but can be pruned to any shape you want) and provides generous coverage for birds. Plus, nurseries offer plenty of cultivars to choose from. But beware: Deer love it, too.

EASTERN WHITE PINE
Pinus strobus, Zones 3 to 7

With long green needles and a quick growing habit, eastern white pine is a good choice for any yard, particularly sunny ones. It reaches 50 to 80 feet tall and 20 to 40 feet wide, so its verdant silhouette is sure to stand out in winter. The deep branches are hospitable to birds during harsh weather, and the cones are a go-to food source for nuthatches and many other seedeaters.

ELDERBERRY
Sambucus spp., Zones 3 to 9

Birds and butterflies alike take shelter among elderberry’s branches. The summer flowers entice swallowtails, hairstreaks and hummers, as well as other pollinators, and birds flock to the late-summer and autumn berries. Species range in height from 10 to 20 feet, and cultivars offer colorful foliage, from black to chartreuse.

FALSECYPRESS
Chamaecyparis, Zones 4 to 9

Mounded, upright or spreading—take your pick among this diverse group of evergreens.

Most types tolerate full sun to light or partial shade and prefer moist, well-drained soil.

FIRETHORN
Pyracantha coccinea, Zones 5 to 9

Though it has glossy green foliage for most of the year, it’s the compact bunches of pea-size red, orange or yellow berries that get all the attention. The spring or summer flowers are sought after by nectaring butterflies.

FLOWERING DOGWOOD
Cornus florida, Zones 5 to 8

Thanks to flowering dogwood’s pink and white bracts surrounding small green flowers, butterflies and other pollinators pay frequent visits in spring. Many birds nest among the branches, and later in the growing season enjoy the bright-red berries. This lovely ornamental reaches 20 to 30 feet tall and grows best in partial to full sun.

HYDRANGEA
Hydrangea, Zones 3 to 10

Gardeners have relied on hydrangeas for years to provide showy summer color. Easy to care for, they happily flower even in partial shade. Bigleaf hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla) are ideal for mild climates but usually won’t flower in regions with cold winters. In those areas, try cultivars of sevenbark hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens), which typically produce big white blooms.

JUNIPER
Juniperus spp., Zones 2 to 9

Also known as redcedar, this tree can grow up to 50 feet tall. A juniper will serve as a secure roosting and nesting site. Some birds, including waxwings, enjoy the berry-like cones, as well. Plant juniper in fall so its roots have time to become established before winter.

Viburnum spp., Zones 2 to 9

Among the most popular of ornamental shrubs and small trees, members of this genus are sought after for three reasons: They’re beautiful, versatile and easy to grow. What’s more, the flowers, the foliage and the colorful fruits all contribute to viburnums’ year-round beauty. Ample moisture is the only requirement to keep in mind.

WEIGELA
Weigela spp., Zones 3 to 9

In addition to its pretty, trumpet-shaped late-spring flowers, which entice returning hummingbirds, weigela boasts attractive foliage throughout the growing season. In some varieties, leaves change color in fall. Sizes range from 2 to 8 feet tall and wide.

WILD BLACK CHERRY
Prunus serotina, Zones 3 to 9

Popular among caterpillars—such as blues, hairstreaks and admirals—that munch on its leaf and flower buds, the wild black cherry’s fruit is also sought after by birds later in the year. This fast-growing tree shines in fall, when its leaves turn yellow or red. It prefers some sun and is salt- and drought-tolerant.

WINTERBERRY
Ilex verticillata, Zones 3 to 9

Few deciduous shrubs garner as much cold-weather interest as winterberry. Unlike most of its holly cousins, it drops its leaves in the autumn, so nothing detracts from the brilliance of the red berries. You’ll love the colorful fruit, and the birds will love you for it. In warmer weather, watch for Henry’s elfins: This is a host plant for these little butterflies.

WISTERIA
Wisteria floribunda, Zones 5 to 9

There’s nothing quite like a blooming garland of wisteria to add romance to a spring backyard—especially when the butterflies (including skippers, sulfurs and blues) and hummingbirds arrive. Provide ample support for the vine’s heavy, woody limbs, which can extend to more than 30 feet, and prune wisteria each year after it flowers.

BACKYARD TIP
Wisteria has a lovely scent, but it is an aggressive grower. It needs to be cut back annually with pruning in order to keep it in check.

WITCH HAZEL
Hamamelis x intermedia, Zones 5 to 9

Just when you’re convinced that winter will never end, witch hazel explodes with masses of fragrant ribbon-petal flowers in copper, yellow or red. Depending on the cultivar and location, this deciduous shrub may blossom as early as January and hold onto its blooms until March. Later on, birds forage for the fallen seeds. The gray-green leaves turn yellow-orange with frost.

YUCCA
Yucca filamentosa, Zones 4 to 11

There’s a good reason that so many gardeners (especially those in the Southwest) use yucca as a backyard centerpiece. It’s about as drought-tolerant as they come. Spiky evergreen leaves create a mound that’s so substantial that birds nest within it, while hummingbirds crave the nectar the beautiful columnar white flowers provide. Types of this shrub can reach 3 to 12 feet tall when in bloom.

Bluebirds
Many, many years ago, the return of bluebirds—especially eastern bluebirds—to northern states in March signaled the arrival of warmer weather. But with mild winters becoming more common, many bluebirds now spend winters in their nesting areas all across the North.
A week or two after the male arrives, the female appears. Then, to the accompaniment of his own incessant warbling, the male pursues his chosen mate from one perch to another, often showing her spots available for nesting.
MAKING A COMEBACK
In the early to mid-1900s, bluebirds almost became extinct. But today, all three species—eastern, western and mountain—are at healthy population levels, and the future looks bright.
They still face challenges, however, such as competition for nesting sites from house sparrows, house wrens, European starlings and tree swallows. Often, just about the time a pair of bluebirds begins to nest, one of the four enemy birds takes over.
House wrens will even poke holes in the bluebirds’ eggs. What’s especially frustrating about this aggressive behavior is that once they win the battle, these other birds often vacate the house.
Nesting starts early among bluebirds, so they can raise at least two broods each year. It’s common for the first brood to help their parents feed the second brood, a practice known as “cooperative breeding.” As the song says, these lovely and popular birds are truly the “bluebird of happiness,” bringing excitement, color and adventure to any backyard.

Baltimore oriole

Orioles
Few songbirds are more visually striking—or create more excitement for birders—than orioles.
No matter where you live in the continental United States and parts of southern Canada, you should be able to attract a brilliant oriole to your backyard. All you have to do is know what they crave (oranges and grape jelly fit the bill)—and offer some tree cover for their protection.
True, orioles have a sweet tooth. But it seems their desire for citrus wanes a bit around the time they start feeding their youngsters insects and caterpillars at the nest. That’s when it’s important to have a sugar-water feeder.

BACKYARD TIP
It’s super easy to attract orioles to your backyard in early spring. Put out grape jelly and orange halves. With any luck, they’ll stick around all summer!

COLORFUL FOR BLACKBIRDS
Even though they’re one of the most brilliant backyard birds, all North American orioles belong to the blackbird family. Unlike other members, however, they spend most of their time high up in the treetops, rather than on the ground.
When orioles return to their northern breeding territories, they look for tree cover and stay well hidden in their search for food. The females also build their incredible nests high above the ground, weaving them from fibers of grasses, grapevines and milkweed.
FAB FIVE
Nine different orioles live throughout the continental United States during the breeding months, but the most common are the Baltimore, Bullock’s, orchard, hooded and Scott’s. Four others—the altimera, Audubon’s, spot-breasted and streak-backed—are rarely spotted or occupy very small territories along the southernmost borders of the United States.
But no matter what the species is, if you cover the basics—trees, fruit and sugar water—there’s a good chance a flashy oriole will visit your backyard in spring.

Frequently Asked Questions
Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees

Q: Are there any plants that entice fireflies?
A: Changes in gardening habits will help bring in the fireflies. Try growing the grass long. The adults lay their eggs in the soil; the larvae feed on snails, slugs and worms. Eliminate the use of chemicals to preserve their food source.  Also, limit outdoor lighting that can interfere with their light signals.  If there’s too much light, fireflies don’t glow. Include low-hanging trees and other vegetation that will provide daytime perches for these insects.


Cityline Vienna bigleaf hydrangea


Cityline Vienna bigleaf hydrangea
Q: How can I get hydrangeas to bloom each year?
A: Most bigleaf hydrangeas, those with pink or blue flowers, produce blooms only on the previous season’s growth. In climates with cold winters, you need to protect the future flowering stems from the cold. Try encircling the plant with 4-foot-tall hardware cloth. Sink it several inches into the ground to keep out rabbits and voles, then fill with weed-free straw or evergreen boughs to insulate the plant. Wrapping the fencing with burlap or weed barrier will add another layer of insulation. Many Northern gardeners have given up on these plants and switched to the hardier panicle hydrangeas. Its flowers start out white and fade to pink before turning brown. The Endless Summer hydrangea collection is supposed to bloom on new and old growth. Moisture and proper fertilization are the keys to success.

Q: How do I keep birdseed that falls to the ground from sprouting?
A: Some birdseed, such as nyjer (thistle), is sterilized and should not sprout. Other kinds, including sunflowers, are not. There is really only one safe way to keep birdseed from sproutingâpresent it to the birds in a tray with sides. That should prevent most spillage and solve your problem.

Q: What type of soil is best for growing columbine?
A: Gardening success is often about patience and persistence. It seems every gardener has a plant or two that has taken several tries to succeed. Try planting columbine in full sun to partial shade with good drainage. Avoid wet, poorly drained soils, which can lead to root rot and plant death.

Q: Bees love this plant! What is it?
A: This heat- and salt-tolerant perennial, Limonium latifolium, is known by several names, including sea lavender, wide-leaf sea lavender and statice. Hardy in Zones 3 to 9, it grows best in full sun with well-drained soil. The plant can flop and might need staking when grown in heavier clay soil. Harvest a few stems to use in dried arrangements or crafts: Cut the flower stems just before the blossoms open fully, then hang upside down in a shady, airy location to dry.

Q: Why do my purple coneflowers only have reddish-brown centers? There are no purple petals.
A: Aster yellows is the culprit. This disease is caused by a phytoplasma, a bacteriumlike organism that attacks more than 300 species of plants, including coreopsis, marigolds, coneflowers, carrots and potatoes, causing discolored and distorted growth.
The disease-causing organism is spread by the aster leafhopper. As this insect feeds, it transfers the disease from infected to healthy plants. Remove infected plants to prevent the disease from spreading to your healthy ones. This disease rarely kills the plant, but the phytoplasma survives in it, which can cause future infection. Fortunately, coneflowers readily reseed, and regular sanitation can help manage this disease.
Q: What are some fast-growing plants that will attract birds and other wildlife?
A: A mix of annuals, perennials, trees and shrubs will provide the food and shelter that wildlife need.
Annuals offer immediate results in any flower garden. Here are some that do well in most soil conditions: sunflower, dahlia, marigold, zinnia, verbena, nasturtium, petunia and cleome.
For perennials, choose yarrow, hollyhock, pearly everlasting, rock cress, butterfly weed, coneflower, black-eyed Susan, daylily, phlox, lupine, bee balm or sedum. Theyâll start filling in and blooming the second year.
Then add evergreens and deciduous trees and shrubs like dogwood, viburnum, shrub rose, hawthorn and maple.

Q: Do you have any tips for growing impatiens? I plant them in containers, fertilize and water them, but they still die.
A: First, be sure you’re buying healthy plants. Always start with clean pots and fresh potting mix to eliminate the risk of diseases carrying over from one growing season to the next. Make sure to check the label on the potting mix before fertilizing, because some include a slow-release fertilizer. Buy those that don’t, and add your own slow-release fertilizer at planting time. This often provides plants with all the nutrients they need for the season. If needed, add a midseason nutrient boost. Check on the containers daily, twice in hot weather, and water thoroughly when needed until the excess runs out the bottom. It’s best to grow impatiens in a shady spot in a container with drainage holes, and to keep the soil slightly moist.

Q: My trumpet vine has only had one bloom in several years. What’s wrong?
A: It can be tough, but trumpet vines require patience. First and foremost, they need to reach maturity before they start blooming. This can take several years after planting. It’s important to avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, because they promote leaf and stem growth while also preventing flowering. Trumpet vines develop an extensive root system that allows them to absorb nutrients from surrounding plant beds and nearby lawns. This means you need to be careful when fertilizing these areas. Use a low-nitrogen, slow-release fertilizer to increase your chance of having a beautiful, blooming vine.
Q: I’m having a hard time growing hummingbird vine. Any advice?
A: Several plants go by the name hummingbird vine. The large orange and yellow flowered trumpet vine (Campsis radicans) attaches to structures with its aerial roots.
The bright-orange, coral-red or scarlet blooming honeysuckle vine (Lonicera spp.) also attracts hummingbirds. It attaches itself to structures by twining around the support.
Once you know which variety you have, make sure you give it the support it needs. A brick wall is a good choice for trumpet vine, while a trellis or arbor is more suitable for the honeysuckle.
You may need to provide a bit of training and guidance in the beginning. Secure branches to the structure with twine or staking tape. Once the vine makes contact, it should continue to grow and cling to the structure on its own. Proper growing conditions and care should get your vine off and growing. Trumpet vine prefers full sun and well-draining soil. Avoid types of fertilization that encourage lots of leaves and no flowers. Honeysuckle vines, on the other hand, like full sun to part shade.
Q: Sometimes hummingbirds fly into blue spruce trees. What are they after?
A: Besides nectar, hummingbirds also eat—and feed their babies—small insects, which they gather from flowers, shrubs and trees. In the case of the blue spruce, not only are they finding insects there, but the sap the tree produces is a nourishing food for them. Often, yellow-bellied sapsuckers will drill holes in spruce trunks to release pools of sap. Hummingbirds feast on this treat, too.
Q: Are there plants that will survive sunny, dry conditions but attract birds and butterflies?
A: Look for native plants that tolerate your climate and attract birds and butterflies. Black-eyed Susan, bluebonnets, Indian blanket, Indian paintbrush, golden tickseed, mealycup sage, Mexican hat, prairie verbena, Texas lantana and Yaupon holly are just a few.

Q: Hummingbirds love bee balm, but mine is not blooming. Why?
A: A lack of nutrients, phosphorous in particular, can cause poor flowering or none at all. Container planted bee balm especially, is usually grown in soilless mixes that don’t retain nutrients and are watered daily, fertilizing regularly is crucial. Use a slow-release fertilizer at the start of the season, with a midseason application if needed. Or try using a flowering-plant fertilizer regularly. Follow label directions and stop fertilizing midseason to reduce the risk of winter damage.

Q: Why do only female ruby-throated hummingbirds show up at feeders?
A: Male and female ruby-throats don’t ever stay together as pairs. The male has a small territory where he courts any passing female and chases away other males. The female has her own home range, where she raises her young. If a female ruby-throat has her nest nearby, she may come to your feeder regularly; if the neighborhood male’s center of activity is farther away, he may be getting his food elsewhere. So in early summer, it’s partly a matter of luck.

Q: When should I start and stop feeding hummingbirds?
A: Early May is a good time to hang out your hummingbird feeders—except in the South, where migratory hummers begin tapping sugar-water feeders in early April. And don’t hurry to take them down in fall. It’s a myth that if you keep your feeders up, the hummingbirds won’t migrate. When you leave your feeders in place through migration season, you’ll catch any late travelers as they fly through your area.
Q: I have feeders but no hummingbirds. How can I attract them?
A: A surefire way to attract hummingbirds is to plant red flowers. Almost any red bloom—geraniums, impatiens, petunias, bee balm, honeysuckle, fuchsia—will entice them to visit a garden. Once you get their attention with the flowers, you can install feeders among the blooms and get them hooked on sugar water. Then you’ll be able to move the feeders wherever you want them.

Q: What is this little blue butterfly?
A: You’ve discovered the common checkered skipper, a butterfly that has two broods—one in spring and another in late summer and early fall. The butterfly’s blue appearance comes from long, bluish hairs on the inner part of the wings. This species prefers fields and pastures with low-growing mallows, where it feeds.
The caterpillars of this butterfly make leaf nests by rolling or attaching a group of leaves together with silk near the top of mallow plants. The nests are fairly easy to find. If you carefully look inside, you will see the greenish caterpillar, with a dark head and covered with short, whitish hairs. The caterpillars will winter fully grown in these leaf shelters.

Q: Butterflies love this flower. What is it?
A: It is a pinxterbloom azalea (Rhododendron periclymenoides). This low-growing azalea produces runners and lots of branches. It typically grows anywhere from 2 to 10 feet tall, and the fragrant flowers appear in spring. Tolerant of sandy, dry and rocky soils, this azalea is hardy in Zones 4 to 8.

Q: What can gardeners do to help the declining honeybee population get back on track?
A: You can help by stopping or minimizing your use of pesticides. To control garden pests, use eco-friendly methods like trapping, barriers and natural products, such as insecticidal soaps that are not harmful to bees.
Then plant a diverse garden filled with flowers suited to your climate that will provide nectar and pollen for the bees. Consider native plants whenever appropriate. A few honeybee favorites are sunflowers, goldenrod, coneflower, bee balm, grape hyacinths and ajuga. And don’t forget about trees and shrubs such as apples, cherries, plums, redbud, abelia, blueberries, blackberries and hollies, and vegetables like pumpkin, eggplant and peas.
Q: Do butterfly houses attract butterflies?
A: Butterfly houses are more of a garden decoration than a way to attract butterflies to your yard.
Although a few butterfly species seek shelter for winter hibernation or a shady roost during the summer, most butterflies usually rest on vegetation or in trees.
However, if you put your houses in a protected area near woodlands, you could attract a mourning cloak or question mark. And in areas where Milbert’s tortoiseshells are found, a butterfly house might be effective, since these butterflies hibernate in large groups.
Be aware, however, that butterfly houses also make good homes for wasps and hornets.

Q: Is this a hummingbird moth?
A: Yes, this is one of the hummingbird moths, also known as sphinx moths or hawk moths. You can find more than 100 species in this family in North America. Many of them take nectar by hovering in front of flowers, very much like a hummingbird. Some species are active only at night, but this one, the white-lined sphinx, will visit flowers in daylight, so it’s regularly seen in gardens. Its caterpillars feed on the leaves of a wide variety of host plants.
Q: Is it possible to create mud puddles to attract butterflies?
A: Butterflies sit on the damp mud and suck water up through their long, tubelike “tongues” (the proboscis). They may be partly just thirsty for water, but they’re also taking in chemicals, especially some natural salts. So if you’re making an artificial puddle, it’s best to use something that’s close to natural soil, plus rainwater or other untreated water if possible.

Verbena







Verbena
Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees
Q: How can I start Verbena bonariensis from seed?
A: Many people struggle to grow this beauty from seed. Give the seeds a cold treatment in the refrigerator for two weeks prior to sprouting. Place the seeds in moistened compost in a plastic bag or just plant the seeds and place the whole container in the refrigerator. Then move to a 65-degree location for germination. Be patient, though; it can take 28 days or more for seeds to germinate. Grow seedlings in a bright location or under artificial lights with good air circulation.

INSTRUCTIONS
NOTE: If you are building the box, follow the instructions from step 1. If you already have a box, begin with step 6.
STEP 1. Cut one 5x5-in. square, two 5x43/4-in. rectangles and two 43/4x41/2-in. rectangles out of 1/4-in. plywood, clear pine, shelf board, barn board or similar.
STEP 2. Glue one 5x43/4-in. rectangle to one 43/4x41/2-in. rectangle. The 43/4-in. dimension is the height of both rectangles. Once joined, they will form an “L” with a short side, and a longer side but both the same height. Clamp until dry. Repeat with the other 2 rectangles.
STEP 3. Glue the two L-shaped side sections to the 5-in.-square box bottom. Make sure that the sections come together to form a perfect square. Clamp until dry.
STEP 4. Once dry, reinforce the joints with small finish nails or brads.
STEP 5. Sand box with fine-grit sandpaper in preparation for painting.
STEP 6. Print out the template (at left) and cut out the bird shape.
STEP 7. Trace bird onto lauan; cut out with the jigsaw.
STEP 8. Using a hole saw attached to a screw gun or drill, bore a 11/4-in. to 11/2-in. hole in the lauan. This is the bird’s entrance, so be sure to place it accordingly.
STEP 9. Sand the face and edges smooth in preparation for painting.
STEP 10. Prime and paint the outside of the box and bird shape, leaving the inside unpainted.


STEP 11. Hinge the bird cutout to the box using a simple 1-in. butt hinge or similar connector (see photo at top right).

Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees
supplies
• Birdhouse
• Upcycled accessories
• Tree leaves (ligustrum, photinia, azaleas, crepe myrtle, laurel, holly, viburnum or a combination), flattened under a heavy book or tiles
• Mod Podge (Outdoor preferred)
• Artist’s paintbrush
• Spray sealer (optional)
• Hot glue, screws or other fasteners
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1. Buy or build a birdhouse. Drill ventilation holes in the sides near the top, and drainage holes in the bottom. Add a predator guard, if possible, and a door for easy cleaning.
Step 2. Choose accessories. Make a base out of a thrift-store find like an ashtray stand, a candlestick or lamp base, or old furniture legs—there are no rules, except the result should be stable. Lighting parts, door hardware and hinges, knobs and handles make great adornments.
Step 3. Attach the base and adornments, using hot glue, screws or other fasteners, as needed.
Step 4. Attach leaves: Using the artist’s brush, paint the backside of a leaf with a thin layer of Mod Podge, press the leaf flat against the house, and then coat the topside of the leaf thinly with Mod Podge. Keep attaching leaves, one at a time, back and front, until the birdhouse is covered. Mod Podge dries quickly. Apply multiple layers, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Several thin layers are more effective and attractive than one or two thick coats.
Step 5. If you have used the indoor version of Mod Podge, add several thin coats of spray sealer to protect the leaves from the elements, allowing each coat to dry thoroughly before applying the next. (Omit this step if you have used Outdoor Mod Podge.)


DIY BEE ACCESSORY
Stir up some buzz with this handsome bee.
1 Cut a 2-in. piece of spindle from a broken chair or use a dowel or other cylindrical piece of wood. Sand it to round it out, paint it yellow and drill 8 holes—1 at the head of the body, 1 at the tail, 2 on the topside for wings and 4 on the underside for legs.
2 At the head end, insert a short length of wire for one antenna. Insert another short length at the tail for the stinger. Take a long length of wire, twist it around the stinger, around the body, and then coil it several times around the antenna to form the head. Bend the end of the same piece to form the second antenna, trimming excess. Insert a short length of wire in each of the 4 bottom holes for the legs.
3 Form 2 lengths of wire into wings, leaving enough at the ends to insert in the top holes. Spray with varnish or shellac. Attach to the birdhouse with weather-resistant adhesive or by bending the legs slightly to grip the sides of the house.

Nest Box in an Instant
Some birds are not pickyâa cute nesting platform made from recycled materials is sometimes all it takes to lure in common nesters, like American robins, wrens and mourning doves. Look for a small galvanized bucket that might need a new life. An item like this is perfectânot too big or too small, with sweet angled sides and a wire handle.
Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees

supplies
• Old bucket
• Hammer and nails
• Screwdriver and wood screw
• Wire
• Needle-nose pliers
• Spray paint
INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. Paint the bucket. Painting is often the easiest way to transform the ordinary into something snazzy. Pumpkin-orange spray paint was used for the outside of this bucket and metallic silver for the inside. If your bucket is in newer condition, you could leave the inside unpainted.
STEP 2. Plan the attachment. If you’re attaching the bucket directly onto a porch column, just drill a hole in the center of the bucket. But if you think you might attach your nesting box differently, make sure it’s ready to hang before accessorizing it with any delicate or decorative objects.
STEP 3. Adorn the bucket. The shape of this bucket looks kind of like a head, so we added something that resembled a hat made of wire. It’s a good option for adorning because wire bends, and birds (unlike bigger critters) have no problem perching on it. The bucket’s wire handles help with any attachments.
STEP 4. Find a site and hang. When choosing a location, keep in mind that Carolina wrens and robins are the most likely birds to take up residence in a nest box. Carolina wren nests are frequently found near homes, usually 3 to 6 feet off the ground, and in odd places. Robins’ nests tend to be in the lower halves of trees, as well as in gutters or eaves, and on outdoor light fixtures and other structures.

• 12 in. 18-gauge copper wire
• Double shot glass (3 oz.)
• Wire strippers or cutters
• Needle-nose pliers
• Pen
• Glass beads
INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. Using the needle-nose pliers, make a small hook at one end of the 10-gauge wire.  This will be the feeder’s hanger.
STEP 2. Starting at the hanger end, gently bend the wire into an arch.  You can use a round object to help with this or you can bend it freehand.
STEP 3. Approximately 12 in. from the hanger end, bend the wire at about a 45-degree angle. Place the shot glass on top of the wire and bend the wire around the bottom.
STEP 4. Cup the wire and glass in one hand while wrapping most of the remaining wire tightly around the glass.
STEP 5. At this point, you should have about 6 to 8 in. of wire remaining. Curve it into a “C” shape in front of the glass to make a perch.
STEP 6. To help the feeder hang better, gently twist the main part of the hanger a quarter turn to the right or left.
STEP 7. Next, to decorate, take the 18-gauge copper wire and start wrapping it around the 10-gauge wire near the top of the hanger.
STEP 8. Wrap the last few inches of wire around a pen to make a curlicue.
STEP 9. Attach beads in alternating sizes. To secure the beads, curl the end of the wire with needle-nose pliers.

supplies
• Tomato cage
• Plastic pot with plants
• Plastic bowl or tray
• Flat, thin metal
• Tin snips
• Spray paint
• Hammer and nail
• Needle-nose pliers
• Wire
FEEDER INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. If you already have a location in mind, install your tomato cage to start. You can either insert the tines into the earth as you would normally (the deeper and more even, the better), or bend the tines outward to form “feet.”
STEP 2. Measure the circumference of the tomato cage ring that you want to use for holding up your plant. Arrange plants in a plastic pot with a top circumference slightly larger than the ring on the cage. Ease it into place.
STEP 3. Measure the very top ring of the tomato cage for a plastic bowl or tray to rest there, and then scout around for a colorful receptacle that fits your dimensions. Your kitchen, yard sales and thrift stores are great options.
STEP 4. Make the flowers. (See flower assembly steps.) Twist the wire stems around the vertical tines of the cage.
STEP 5. Last but not least, drop the bowl or tray into the top ring of the cage, and add birdseed.
FLOWER INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. Draw a simple flower shape on your choice of metal and cut 2 or more with tin snips or similar metal-cutting tool.
STEP 2. Cut out one small center circle for each two flowers you cut.
STEP 3. Spray-paint flowers and circles in the colors of your choice.
STEP 4. Nestle two of the flowers together and place one circle on top in the center. Using a nail and a hammer, punch a hole in the center of the flower cluster with a whack of the hammer on the nail. Repeat for all flowers.
STEP 5. Take about 12 in. of wire that is stiff enough to hold the flowers upright but flexible enough to bend easily. Using needle-nose pliers, twist a loop in the wire about 2 in. from one end. This will support the flowers so they don’t fall straight down the wire.
STEP 6. Thread the flower cluster onto the short end of the wire to rest on the loop you made, and twist the wire above the flower into a spiral using needle-nose pliers. This will sandwich the flowers between loops so they are secure. Repeat for the rest of the flowers, and you’re ready to attach them to the tomato cage.

A Bottle for Hummingbirds
Forget buying expensive, decorative sugar-water feeders. Now you can make your own for just a few bucks by using a recycled bottle. Youâll be amazed at how fun and easy it is to make this one-of-a-kind feeder using a glass bottle. And with the copper accents, itâs a decorative addition to your backyard, too.

supplies
• Glass bottle
• 5 ft. of 4-gauge untreated copper wire
• 3 to 5 ft. of 12-gauge untreated copper wire
• Hummingbird feeding tube
• Beads or other decorations
• D-ring or carabiner
• Screw eye
• File
• Needle-nose pliers
• Wire cutter

CHOOSING A BOTTLE
Glass bottles larger than 375 ml are heavy and more prone to leakage. Thus, they are not recommended for this project. Above all, the bottle must provide a tight fit for the stopper portion of the feeding tube you buy.
Anything less than an airtight fit will allow the nectar to drip from the feeding tube. Many soda and water bottles are a good fit for a commercial tube feeder assembly. Be sure to test the seal before you complete your design and add sugar water.

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1. File the ends of the copper wires so there are no sharp edges.
Step 2. Take the 4-gauge wire and bend it at one of the ends to form a small circle. This should fit loosely over the opening of the bottle.
Step 3. Insert the bottle in the circle, and make one more loop around the neck to hold it securely.
Step 4. With the neck of the bottle securely in the two loops, wind the rest of the wire around the bottle. (You have a little freedom to create your own design.) The wire should be loose enough to easily remove the bottle for refilling the sugar water, but tight enough to hold the feeder securely.
Step 5. Bend the last 18 inches or so of wire upward to make a hanging hook and then fashion a loop at the very end to secure it, as shown.
Step 6. Next, decorate your feeder using the 12-gauge copper wire.
Step 7. Use needle-nose pliers and wire cutters to shape the wire as needed. Here’s a design tip: To create the look of curling vines, wrap the wire around a pencil first and then attach it in pieces.
Step 8. Use colorful beads or other adornments to complete your design. Remember, hummingbirds love red, so it’s a great accent color.
Step 9. Remove the bottle and fill with sugar water. Gently twist the stopper of the store-bought feeding tube into place at the opening of the bottle. It should fit snugly to avoid leaking.
Step 10. After you fill it with sugar water, place the bottle back into the copper holder. You might have to shake the bottle a little to dislodge any air bubbles. If it leaks, remove the feeding tube and try repositioning the stopper to get a more snug fit.
Step 11. Ready to put your feeder to work? Make sure it hangs securely by hooking the feeder onto a snap ring or carabiner. Put the ring through a screw eye and hang the entire feeder in the desired location. Then, sit back, relax and watch for hummingbirds. Change the sugar water every few days.

Bringing Solar to the Garden
This is a really simple project. The most vital step is picking a sunny location for your pots before you start. This is important for two reasons. First, the fountain will work only when the sun is shining directly on the solar panels. Second, once the fountain is assembled, it’ll probably be too heavy to move! Pick up some pretty pots and a solar fountain pump this year—you’ll have a new water feature and planter for your yard in no time.

NOTE: We placed this fountain in dappled sun to get a good photo, but remember, full sun is best long-term.

supplies
• 2 pots of different sizes
• Platform to go in larger pot
• Soil
• Plants
• Solar-powered fountain unit (see Step 6)
INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. This project starts at the garden center where you choose your containers. In the picture, you’ll see that the fountain features a smaller pot nestled in a larger one. (The third pot visible behind the large one is not necessary.) While you’re at the store, test out different pots to see how they look together. You’ll want to make sure the proportions are right before you get them home.
STEP 2. If your containers have drainage holes, you’ll need to plug the holes of the smaller one, which will hold water for the fountain. We used cork to plug the hole and then covered it with heavy-duty plastic using hot glue. You don’t have to use cork, but choose a material that won’t deteriorate. Make sure all the edges of the plastic are glued down and everything is dry. To check for leaks, pour a pitcher of water into the pot. And if your large pot doesn’t have drainage holes, drill a few in the bottom so your soil won’t be soggy.
STEP 3. Put the platform in the larger pot. The one pictured here uses a wooden platform fitted about halfway down into the container. If you’re using round pots, you could also use an Ups-A-Daisy planter insert, which you can check out at ups-a-daisy.com.
STEP 4. Place the smaller pot in the larger one, setting it firmly on the platform insert. Make sure it’s level and secure. Then fill the space between the pots with potting soil.
STEP 5. Slowly add water to the top pot, making sure the pot stays level and safely seated in the soil. When the small pot is full, plant your flowers or greenery in the large pot and pack the soil tightly around the small pot to keep it secure. Water the plants until the water seeps out the drainage hole of the bottom pot, adding soil as necessary.
STEP 6. Finally, unpack and assemble the solar fountain and place it in the small pot. We used a self-contained unit where the solar panels float on the water. Other models have solar panels that are connected to the pump with wires, with the panel generally stuck into the ground some distance away. The latter, which are designed mostly for ponds, won’t work as well for this project.
STEP 7. As the water evaporates, add more. And don’t forget to water your plants, too!

Mosaic Birdbath
Ready to get crafty? Attract birds in style with this simple do-it-yourself birdbath. It might look difficult and expensive, but itâs really quite easy and cheap to make.
Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees

Gardening for Birds Butterflies & Bees
supplies
• 12-in. terra-cotta saucer
• Terra-cotta sealer
• Approximately 300 3/8-in. glass tiles of your choice
• Water-resistant tile adhesive
• Sanded grout in your choice of color
• Outdoor penetrating grout sealer
• Foam paintbrush
• Paper towels
• Tile cutters
• Plastic knife
• Rubber gloves
• Several soft cloths
• Sponge
• Safety glasses
• Dust mask
INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1. Rinse terra-cotta saucer to remove dust and debris. Allow to dry overnight before sealing.
STEP 2. Seal all saucer surfaces with a terra-cotta sealer. Allow to dry at least two hours before gluing on mosaic pieces.
STEP 3. Using the plastic knife, apply a thin layer of adhesive to the back of each tile. Press the tile, adhesive side down, to the saucer. (It is easiest to start gluing from the outside of the pattern and then work your way in.)
STEP 4. Allow no more than 1/4 in. between the pieces and try to keep the distance the same between all the pieces. This will add strength to your birdbath and will be more pleasing to the eye.
STEP 5. If you’d like to create a specific pattern or design, it’s good to have a pair of tile cutters handy. For example, you could cut some tiles diagonally.
STEP 6. Once all the tiles are in place, allow the adhesive to dry for at least 24 hours before grouting.
STEP 7. Cover your work surface and put on a dust mask before you begin mixing the grout, as the dust from dry grout can harm your lungs. Mix the sanded grout according to package directions. You can remove the dust mask once the grout has been mixed and is no longer powdery. Your grout should be the consistency of peanut butter when completely mixed. If it’s too wet, the grout will be weaker and harder to clean up.
STEP 8. Allow grout to sit five to 10 minutes before applying it to the saucer. If you buy premixed grout, make sure it is sanded grout for outdoor use.
STEP 9. Wearing rubber gloves, apply grout by hand or with a plastic putty knife. Press grout between all the pieces and smooth with your fingers. When applying grout to the rim of the saucer, make sure the edge of each tile is completely covered and is smooth to the touch. Allow the grout to sit for 20 to 60 minutes or until it begins to dry. Then wipe off any excess grout with a dry cloth.
STEP 10. Allow the grout to sit for an additional 30 to 60 minutes. Then fill a bucket with warm water, wet your sponge, wring it out well and use it to wipe off any film.
STEP 11. You may have to wipe your piece several times over the course of an hour or two. Rinse and wring the sponge often for best results. If a film keeps forming on the piece, either your sponge is too wet or dirty or you need to let the grout dry a little longer before wiping it down.
STEP 12. After several hours, buff the tiles with a clean soft cloth to remove the last of the film.
STEP 13. Allow the grout to dry at least 24 hours before sealing with an outdoor penetrating sealer. Follow manufacturer’s instructions. Usually you will need to apply the sealer with a foam paintbrush. Allow the sealer to dry for five to 10 minutes, then wipe off the excess with a paper towel.
STEP 14. Allow birdbath to dry for two hours, then apply another coat of sealer.
STEP 15. Leave the outside unpainted or apply an outdoor acrylic paint.

supplies
• Large leaf
• 1/2 to 1 bag of play sand
• 3 to 4 cups of contractor’s sand
• 1 to 2 cups Portland cement
• Concrete fortifier
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1. Choose a leaf at least 10 in. long and 7 in. wide. (We used a hosta leaf here, but rhubarb, burdock, gunnera, castor bean, caladium and elephant-ear leaves also work well.) Cut the stem off.
Step 2. Spread out a plastic sheet or a large plastic bag to protect your work surface. Pour the play sand onto the plastic and make a pile. Wet the sand slightly so that it sticks together, the way you would for a sandcastle.


Step 3. Shape the pile to approximate the size and shape of your leaf, but keep in mind that birds do not like baths that are more than a couple of inches deep. Once the sand pile is to your liking, cover it with a piece of plastic or a plastic bag. Place the leaf vein-side up on top of the plastic, centering it.


Step 3. Shape the pile to approximate the size and shape of your leaf, but keep in mind that birds do not like baths that are more than a couple of inches deep. Once the sand pile is to your liking, cover it with a piece of plastic or a plastic bag. Place the leaf vein-side up on top of the plastic, centering it.
Step 4. In a plastic bowl, mix three parts contractor’s sand to one part Portland cement. Mix 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of concrete fortifier, and add slowly to the sand until it reaches the consistency of a thick brownie batter. The easiest way to do this is to squish it with your hands wearing rubber gloves. Mix more water and fortifier to add to the sand if needed.
Step 5. Rinse your gloves or hands. Pick up a handful of the sand mixture, plop it on the center of the leaf and spread to the edges. This gives you a solid surface that picks up the leaf’s veining while removing air bubbles.


Step 6. Now slowly start building up the thickness of the casting. For strength, keep it between 1/2 and 1 in. thick. Be careful to keep the edges smooth to get a good contour. Once you have it at a good thickness, build up the center to make a pedestal.


Step 6. Now slowly start building up the thickness of the casting. For strength, keep it between 1/2 and 1 in. thick. Be careful to keep the edges smooth to get a good contour. Once you have it at a good thickness, build up the center to make a pedestal.
Step 7. Cover the mixture loosely with plastic. If it’s a hot day, you might want to mist the casting from time to time to keep it from drying out too fast and cracking. Let your project dry slowly for about 24 hours, then peel off the leaf. If the casting feels brittle, let it sit for another day.


Step 8. After the casting has dried for a good week, you can paint or seal it. (We painted this one green.) Or just leave it as is!

BIRDBATH MAINTENANCE
You can leave your birdbath out year-round, but if it’s painted or stained, you may want to bring it inside during winter. Clean it just as you would any other birdbath, using a sponge or small brush once a week.
