Preface

For over 150 years, scientists have studied plant nutrition with goals of understanding the acquisi-
tion, accumulation, transport, and  functions  of  chemical  elements  in  plants.  From  these  studies,
much information has been obtained about the growth and composition of plants in response to soil-
borne elements and to fertilization of crops in the soil or in soil-less media, as in hydroponic cul-
ture of plants. A compilation of elements known as plant nutrients and beneﬁcial elements has also
been developed from this work.

Plant nutrients are chemical elements that are essential for plant growth. For an element to be
essential, it must be required for a plant to complete its life cycle, it must be required by all plants,
and no other nutrient can replace this requirement fully. If an element does not meet all of these re-
quirements, for example, being required by some plants or only enhancing the growth of plants, the
element may be a beneﬁcial element. Much interest in plant nutrition lies in the development and
use of diagnostic techniques for assessment of the status of plants with respect to plant nutrients and
beneﬁcial elements.

Soil testing is a common approach to assessments of soil fertility and plant nutrition. With cor-
relation to plant growth, development, and yield, soil testing indicates the capacity of soils to sup-
ply plant nutrients and suggests appropriate corrective measures. Plant analysis, used in conjunc-
tion with plant symptoms and soil testing, is another common tool for assessment of the nutritional
status of plants.

This handbook covers principles of plant nutrition from a historical standpoint to current knowl-
edge of the requirements of crops for certain elements and the beneﬁcial eﬀects of others. Its lay-
out owes much to Homer D. Chapman’s 1966 book Diagnostic Criteria for Plants and Soils and,
as with that book, presents contributions from eminent plant and soil scientists from around the
world. The purpose of this handbook is to provide a current, readily available source of information
on the nutritional requirements of world crops.

In the Introduction, the editors provide an overview of plant nutrients and beneﬁcial elements
and note diagnostic criteria and research approaches used by current investigators who are inter-
ested in plant nutrition.

Each of the chapters dealing with plant nutrients starts with historical information of each nu-
trient, including the demonstration of essentiality and functions in plants. Each of these chapters
will include diagnosis of the nutritional status of plants through assessments of plant appearance
and composition. Tabulated data will help correlate plant appearance and composition with regard
to nutritional needs. A discussion of the value of soil tests for assessment of the nutritional status of
plants will be provided in each chapter. Each chapter will conclude with fertilizers that can be ap-
plied to remedy nutritional deﬁciencies in plants.

Chapters concerning beneﬁcial elements will discuss the history of the relation of the beneﬁcial
eﬀects of these elements to crop growth and yield and will relate the beneﬁts to growth stimulation
and plant metabolism for particular plant species.

A separate CD-ROM containing all the photographs and some line drawings in color is included
with the book, because color versions of the illustrations offer details not obvious in black-and-
white pictures.

With the world population increasing rapidly, and projected to do so for some time, and with
improved plant nutrition remaining as one of the major factors increasing crop yields, use of our
knowledge of plant nutrition to maximize agricultural yields grows in importance. However, public
interest in minimizing the use of chemical inputs in agriculture also is increasing with emphasis on

CRC_DK2972_FM.qxd  7/20/2006  1:43 PM  Page vi

less use of chemical fertilizers and more use of alternative fertilizers. Attention to precision agri-
culture, in  which  plant  nutrition  is  controlled  or  monitored  carefully, has  grown  in  research  and
practice. All of these situations require knowledge of plant nutrition.

The handbook is intended to be a practical reference work for anyone who needs to know the
requirements of the world’s major crops for essential or beneﬁcial elements. It will also give infor-
mation on how to assess and govern the nutritional status of crops. It should be of use to farmers,
agricultural advisers, soil scientists, and plant scientists.

1.1 DEFINITIONS

1.1.1 PLANT NUTRIENT
A plant nutrient is a chemical element that is essential for plant growth and reproduction. Essential
element is a term often used to identify a plant nutrient. The term nutrient implies essentiality, so it
is redundant to call these elements essential nutrients. Commonly, for an element to be a nutrient,
it must fit certain criteria. The principal criterion is that the element must be required for a plant to
complete its life cycle. The second criterion is that no other element substitutes fully for the ele-
ment being considered as a nutrient. The third criterion is that all plants require the element. All the
elements that have been identified as plant nutrients, however, do not fully meet these criteria, so,
some debate occurs regarding the standards for classifying an element as a plant nutrient. Issues
related to the identification of new nutrients are addressed in some of the chapters in this handbook.
The first criterion, that the element is essential for a plant to complete its life cycle, has histor-
ically been the one with which essentiality is established (1). This criterion includes the property
that the element has a direct effect on plant growth and reproduction. In the absence of the essen-
tial element or with severe deficiency, the plant will die before it completes the cycle from seed to
seed. This requirement acknowledges that the element has a function in plant metabolism; that with
short supply of the nutrient, abnormal growth or symptoms of deficiency will develop as a result of
the disrupted metabolism; and that the plant may be able to complete its life cycle with restricted

3

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

growth and abnormal appearance. This criterion also notes that the occurrence of an element in a
plant is not evidence of essentiality. Plants will accumulate elements that are in solution without
regard to the elements having any essential role in plant metabolism or physiology. 

The second criterion states that the role of the element must be unique in plant metabolism or
physiology, meaning that no other element will substitute fully for this function. A partial substitution
might be possible. For example, a substitution of manganese for magnesium in enzymatic reactions
may occur, but no other element will substitute for magnesium in its role as a constituent of chloro-
phyll (2). Some scientists believe that this criterion is included in the context of the first criterion (3).
The third criterion requires that the essentiality is universal among plants. Elements can affect
plant growth without being considered as essential elements (3,4). Enhancement of growth is not a
defining characteristic of a plant nutrient, since although growth might be stimulated by an element,
the element is not absolutely required for the plant to complete its life cycle. Some plants may respond
to certain elements by exhibiting enhanced growth or higher yields, such as that which occurs with the
supply of sodium to some crops (5,6). Also, some elements may appear to be required by some plants
because the elements have functions in metabolic processes in the plants, such as in the case of cobalt
being required for nitrogen-fixing plants (7). Nitrogen fixation, however, is not vital for these plants
since they will grow well on mineral or inorganic supplies of nitrogen. Also, plants that do not fix
nitrogen do not have any known need for cobalt (3). Elements that might enhance growth or that have
a function in some plants but not in all plants are referred to as beneficial elements.

Seventeen elements are considered to have met the criteria for designation as plant nutrients.
Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are derived from air or water. The other 14 are obtained from soil or
nutrient solutions (Table 1.1). It is difficult to assign a precise date or a specific researcher to the
discovery of the essentiality of an element. For all the nutrients, their roles in agriculture were
the subjects of careful investigations long before the elements were accepted as nutrients. Many

individuals contributed to the discovery of the essentiality of elements in plant nutrition. Much of
the early research focused on the beneficial effects or sometimes on the toxic effects of the ele-
ments. Generally, an element was accepted as a plant nutrient after the body of evidence suggested
that the element was essential for plant growth and reproduction, leading to the assignment of cer-
tain times and individuals to the discovery of its essentiality (Table 1.1).

Techniques of hydroponics (8,9) initiated in the mid-1800s and improved in the 1900s enabled
experimenters to grow plants in defined media purged of elements. Elements that are required in con-
siderable quantities (macronutrients), generally accumulating to 0.1% and upward of the dry mass in
plant tissues, were shown to be nutrients in the mid-1800s. Most of the elements required in small quan-
tities in plants (micronutrients), generally accumulating to amounts less than 0.01% of the dry mass of
plant tissues, were shown to be essential only after techniques were improved to ensure that the water,
reagents, media, atmosphere, and seeds did not contain sufficient amounts of nutrients to meet the needs
of the plants. Except for iron, the essentiality of micronutrients was demonstrated in the 1900s.

Beneficial elements may stimulate growth or may be required by only certain plants. Silicon,
cobalt, and sodium are notable beneficial elements. Selenium, aluminum, vanadium, and other ele-
ments have been suggested to enhance growth of plants (3,10). Some of the beneficial elements may
be classified in the future as essential elements as developments in chemical analysis and methods of
minimizing contamination during growth show that plants will not complete their life cycles if the
concentrations of elements in plant tissues are diminished sufficiently. Nickel is an example of an
element that was classified as beneficial but recently has been shown to be essential (11).

Studies of the roles of nutrients in plants have involved several diagnostic criteria that address
the accumulation of nutrients and their roles in plants. These criteria include visual diagnosis, plant
analysis, biochemical tests, and soil tests.

1.2 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

1.2.1 VISUAL DIAGNOSIS
Careful observations of the growth of plants can furnish direct evidence of their nutritional conditions.
Metabolic disruptions resulting from nutrient deficiencies provide links between the function of an ele-
ment and the appearance of a specific visible abnormality. Symptoms of disorders, therefore, provide a
guide  to  identify  nutritional  deficiencies  in  plants.  Careful  experimental  work  and  observations  are
needed to characterize symptoms. For example, nitrogen is needed for protein synthesis and for chloro-
phyll synthesis, and symptoms appear as a result of the disruption of these processes. Symptoms of
nitrogen  deficiency  appear  as  pale-green  or  yellow  leaves  starting  from  the  bottom  and  extending
upward or sometimes covering the entire plant. Magnesium deficiency also affects protein synthesis
and chlorophyll synthesis, but the symptoms may not resemble those of nitrogen deficiency, which
affects the same processes. Experience is necessary to distinguish the symptoms of nitrogen deficiency
from symptoms of magnesium deficiency or in the identification of the deficiency of any nutrient.

Symptoms on foliage have been classified into five types (12): (a) chlorosis, which may be uni-
form or interveinal (Figure 1.1); (b) necrosis, which may be at leaf tips or margins, or be interveinal
(Figure 1.2); (c) lack of new growth, which may result in death of terminal or axillary buds and
leaves, dieback, or rosetting (Figure 1.3); (d) accumulation of anthocyanin, which results in an over-
all red color (Figure 1.4); and (e) stunting with normal green color or an off-green or yellow color
(Figure 1.5). Symptoms of deficiency can be quite specific according to nutrient, especially if the
diagnosis  is  made  early  in  the  development  of  the  symptoms.  Symptoms  may  become  similar
among deficiencies as the intensities of the symptoms progress.

Generalities of development of deficiency symptoms can be made among species. Many refer-
ences are available with descriptions, plates, or keys that enable identification of nutrient deficien-
cies (12–20). As mentioned above, for example, nitrogen deficiency appears across plant species as
chlorosis of lower or of all leaves on plants. Advanced stages of nitrogen deficiency can lead to
leaf death and leaf drop. Nitrogen-deficient plants generally are stunted and spindly in addition to

showing the discoloration that is imparted by chlorosis. Potassium-deficient plants have marginal and
tip necrosis of lower leaves. On the other hand, for elements that are immobile (not transported in
phloem) or slowly mobile in plants, the deficiency symptoms will appear on the young leaves first.
The symptoms might appear as chlorosis, as with sulfur, iron, manganese, zinc, or copper deficiency,
or the symptoms might be necrosis of entire plant tips, as occurs with boron or calcium deficiency.
Brooms or rosetting may occur in cases where deficiencies (e.g., copper or zinc) have caused death
of the terminal bud and lateral buds have grown or where internode elongation has been restricted by

nutrient  (e.g., zinc)  deficiencies. Accumulation  of  anthocyanin, exhibited  by  reddening  of  leaves,
may indicate phosphorus deficiency, although nitrogen deficiency can lead to a similar development.
Some people try to distinguish the two deficiencies by noting whether the symptoms of reddening
develop between the veins (phosphorus deficiency) or along the veins (nitrogen deficiency). Stunting
is a good indication of nutrient deficiency, but often stunting cannot be recognized unless a well-
nourished plant is available as a standard of comparison. A stunted plant may have normal color and
not be recognized as being deficient until abnormal coloration develops with advanced stages of defi-
ciency. In some cases, symptoms may not develop during the growth cycle of crops, but yields may
be suppressed relative to plants that have optimum nutrition. Hidden hunger is a term applied to cases
where yield suppression occurred but symptoms did not develop.

Deficiency symptoms can occur at any stage of growth of a plant. The most typical symptoms
are those that appear early in the cycle of deficiency. Early diagnosis of deficiencies may also allow

time for remedial action to take place. Generally, however, if symptoms have appeared, irreparable
damage has occurred, with quantity or quality of yields being suppressed or diminished with annual
crops or with slowing or damaging of growth and development of perennial crops. Also, symptoms
that resemble nutrient deficiency can develop on plants as a result of conditions that are not related
to nutrient deficiencies, for example, drought, wet soils, cold soils, insect or disease infestations,
herbicide damage, wind, mechanical damage, salinity, or elemental toxicities. Deficiency symptoms
are only one of several diagnostic criteria that can be used to assess the nutritional status of plants.
Plant analysis, biological tests, soil analysis, and application of fertilizers containing the nutrient in
question are additional tools used in diagnosis of the status of plant nutrition.

1.2.2 PLANT ANALYSIS
Plant analysis as a means of understanding plant physiology perhaps started with de Saussure (21).
With plant analysis, de Saussure corrected the misunderstanding at the time that the mineral matter
of plants had no importance. He showed that the mineral matter in plants came from the soil and
not  from  the  air  and  that  little  growth  of  plants  occurred  if  they  were  grown  in  distilled  water.
Through plant analysis, he also demonstrated that plants absorbed minerals in ratios that differed
from the proportions existing in solution or in soil and that plants absorbed substances from solu-
tion, whether the substances were beneficial to the plants or not. 

Plant analysis was one of the means used by scientists in the 1800s to determine the essential-
ity of chemical elements as plant nutrients (22). Further refinements and applications of plant analy-
sis led to studies of the relationship between crop growth or yield and nutrient concentrations in
plants (23–26). Elemental analysis of leaves is commonly used as a basis for crop fertilizer recom-
mendations (27,28).

Plants can be tested for sufficiency of nutrition by analytical tests, which employ quantitative
analysis (total or specific components) in laboratories, or by tissue tests (semiquantitative analysis),
often applied in the field. With proper means of separation of constituents, quantitative tests may
measure nutrients that have been incorporated into plant structures or that are present as soluble
constituents in the plant sap. The tissue tests generally deal with soluble constituents.

1.2.3 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Quantitative  plant  analysis  has  several  functions  in  assessing  the  nutrient  status  of  plants  (29).
Among these functions, plant analysis can be used to confirm a visual diagnosis. Plant analysis

also can help in identifying hidden hunger or incipient deficiencies. In confirming diagnoses or in
identifying incipient deficiencies, comparisons are made between laboratory results and critical
values or ranges that assess the nutritional status as deficient, low, sufficient, or high, or in other
applicable terms. The  critical  concentration of a nutrient is defined as the concentration of the
nutrient below which yields are suppressed (26,30). In the determination of critical concentration,
analysis of a specific tissue of a specific organ at a designated state of development is required.
Because  of  the  amount  of  work  involved, critical  concentrations  are  rarely  determined;  conse-
quently, ranges of sufficiency are most commonly used in assessment of plant nutrition (27). For
each nutrient or beneficial element mentioned in this handbook, ranges of sufficiency are reported. 
For any plant, it could be that only one nutrient is deficient or in excess, but it is also possible
that more than one nutrient may be out of its range of sufficiency. Furthermore, the actual require-
ment for an individual nutrient may be different if other nutrients are not present in the plant above
their own critical concentrations. For this reason, it is becoming common to consider concentrations
of nutrients in relation to the concentrations of other nutrients within the plant. Forms of multivari-
ate analysis such as principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis have been
used to investigate relationships between the internal concentrations of many nutrients together and
plant growth (31). Currently, a commonly used application of plant analysis is the Diagnosis and
Recommendation  Integrated  System  (DRIS), which  compares  ratios  of  concentrations  of  all  the
possible pairs of elements analyzed to establish values that help to identify nutrients that are most
likely to be deficient (32,33).

Plant analysis is also used to determine if an element entered a plant. Fertilization is employed
to correct deficiencies, often in response to a visual diagnosis. It is important to know that nutrients
actually entered plants after the application of the nutrients to the soil or foliage. No response to the
application of a nutrient may be understood as meaning that the element was not lacking, when in
fact, it might not have been absorbed by the plant being treated. Plant analysis can also indicate the
effects of application of plant nutrients on plant composition with regard to elements other than the
one being studied. Interactions may occur to enhance or to suppress the absorption of other nutri-
ents. In some cases, growth may be stimulated by a nutrient to the point that other nutrients become
deficient, and further growth cannot occur. Plant analysis can help to detect changes in plant com-
position or growth that are synergistic or antagonistic with crop fertilization. 

Collecting samples of plant organs or tissues is important in assessing nutrition by plant analy-
sis. Comparable leaves or other organs or tissues from the same plant or from similar plants should
be collected as samples that show symptoms and samples that do not. Samples of abnormal and nor-
mal material from the same plant or similar plants allow for development of standards of compari-
son  for  deficient, optimum, or  excessive  nutrition.  The  composition  of  plants  varies  with  time
(diurnal and stage of growth) and with parts of plants as well as with nutrition (34). It is wise to take
samples from plant parts that have been studied widely and for which published standards of com-
parisons for deficient, sufficient, and optimum concentrations of nutrients are available. Jones and
Steyn (35) discuss methods of sampling and sample preparation prior to analysis, along with meth-
ods of extracting nutrients for analysis and methods of analysis of plant tissues. A handbook edited
by Kalra (36) also addresses sampling and analysis of plant tissues.

1.2.4 TISSUE TESTING
Plant tissue testing is a technique for rapid determination of the nutritional status of a crop and is
often conducted on the field sites where crops are grown. The test generally assesses the nutrient
status by direct measurements of the unassimilated fraction of the nutrient in question in the plant.
For example, determination of nitrate in leaf petioles, midribs, or blades or in roots is often a cho-
sen tissue test for assessment of the nitrogen status of a plant (37–40). Nitrate in these plant parts
represents an unassimilated form of nitrogen that is in transit to the leaves and often shows greater
variations in response to soil nutrient relations than determinations of total nitrogen in plant parts,
although some research indicates that total nitrogen concentration in the whole plant gives the best

CRC_DK2972_Ch001.qxd  6/30/2006  12:48 PM  Page 10

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

index of plant nitrogen nutrition (41). Generally, in a tissue test, the sap of the tissues is extracted
by  processes  such  as  crushing  or  grinding  along  with  filtering  to  collect  liquid  for  testing  (34).
Testing of a component, such as nitrate in the sap, is often done by semiquantitative determinations
with nitrate-sensitive test strips (37,40,42,43), by hand-held nitrate-testing meters (44), or by quan-
titative  laboratory  measurements  (45).  In  tissue  testing, ammonium  determinations  are  used  less
often than nitrate determinations because accumulation of ammonium can be an artifact of sampling
and analysis (46).

An exception to the direct determination of an element to assess deficiency was the corn (Zea
mays L.) stalk test of Hoffer (47). This test was based on the observation that insoluble iron com-
pounds appeared at the nodes of corn plants under stress of potassium deficiency (48). The corn
stalk test provided only a rough indication of the potassium nutrition of the plant but had a fair
agreement with other tests for potassium deficiency and had some application to crops other than
corn (34). Similarly, Leeper (49) noted that manganese-deficient oats (Avena sativa L.) accumulated
nitrate in stems.

Selection of the plant part for testing varies with the nutrient being assessed. With nitrate, it may
be important that conductive tissue be selected so that the sampling represents the nutrient in tran-
sit  to  a  site  of  assimilation  and  before  metabolic  conversions  occur.  However, potassium  is  not
assimilated into organic combinations in plants; hence, selection of a plant part is of lesser impor-
tance than with determination of nitrate, and leaf petioles, midribs, blades, or other tissues can be
used for potassium determination by quick tests or by laboratory measurements (50,51). 

Color of leaves can be used as a visual assessment of the nutrient status of plants. This assess-
ment can also be quantitative in a quick test, and chlorophyll-measuring meters have been used to
nondestructively evaluate the nitrogen status of plants (52). The meters have to be used in reference
to predetermined readings for plants receiving adequate nutrition and at selected stages of develop-
ment, which are usually before flowering and maturation. Correlations of readings with needs for
nitrogen fertilization may not be good as the plant matures and flowers and as materials are trans-
ported from leaves to fruits. 

Leaf canopy reflectance (near-infrared or red), as employed in remote sensing techniques, can
be used to assess the nutrient status of fields. Reflectance has been shown to be related to chloro-
phyll concentrations and to indicate the nitrogen status of crops in a field (53).

1.2.5 BIOCHEMICAL TESTS
Activities of specific enzymes can provide rapid and sensitive indicators of nutrient deficiencies in
plants (54). Deficiencies of micronutrients can lead to inhibited activities of enzymes for which the
nutrient is part of the specific enzyme molecule. Assays of enzymatic activity can help identify defi-
ciencies  when  visual  diagnosis  does  not  distinguish  between  deficiencies  that  produce  similar
symptoms (55), when soil analysis does not determine if nutrients enter plants, or when plant analy-
sis  does  not  reflect  the  concentration  of  a  nutrient  needed  for  physiological  functions  (56). The
enzymatic assays do not give concentrations of nutrients in plants, but the enzyme activity gives an
indication of sufficiency or deficiency of a nutrient. The assay can be run on deficient tissue or on
tissue into which the suspected element has been infiltrated to reactivate the enzymatic system. The
assays are run on crude extracts or leaf disks to provide quick tests (57).

Peroxidase assays have been used to distinguish iron deficiency from manganese deficiency in
citrus (Citrus spp. L.) (55,58). Peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes that use hydrogen perox-
ide as the electron acceptor to catalyze a number of oxidative reactions. In this application, during
iron deficiency, peroxidase activity is inhibited, whereas during manganese deficiency peroxidase
activity may be increased. Iron is a constituent of peroxidase, but manganese is not. Kaur et al. (59)
reported associations of limited catalase and peroxidase activities with iron deficiency in chickpeas
(Cicer arietinum L.). Leidi et al. (60) evaluated catalase and peroxidase activities as indicators of
iron  and  manganese  nutrition  for  soybeans  (Glycine  max Merr.).  Nenova  and  Stoyanov  (61)

reported that intense iron deficiency resulted in low activities of peroxidase, catalase, and nitrate
reductase in corn (Zea mays L.). Ranieri et al. (62) observed a suppression of peroxidase activity in
iron-deficient sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). On the other hand, carbonic anhydrase has been
employed  to  identify  zinc  deficiency  in  citrus  (63), sugarcane  (Saccharum  officinarum  L.)  (64),
black gram (Vigna mungo L.) (65), and pecan (Carya illinoinensis Koch) (66). Zinc deficiency was
associated with a decrease in messenger RNA for carbonic anhydrase along with a decrease in car-
bonic anhydrase activity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) (67). In another assay, alcohol dehydrogenase was
twice as high in roots of zinc-sufficient rice as in zinc-deficient rice, and activity of alcohol dehy-
drogenase  in  roots  was  correlated  with  zinc  concentration  in  leaves  (68). Ascorbic  acid  oxidase
assays have been used in the identification of copper deficiency in citrus (69). Molybdenum defi-
ciency has been associated with low levels of nitrate reductase activity in citrus (70). Polle et al.
(71)  reported  that  the  activities  of  superoxide  dismutase  and  some  other  protective  enzymes
increased in manganese-deficient leaves of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.).

Applications of enzymatic assays for the micronutrient status of plants have not been adopted
widely in agronomic or horticultural practice, although interest in usage may be increasing as is
shown by the number of investigations associating enzymatic activity with plant nutrients. The per-
oxidase test in the assessment of iron deficiency has perhaps been employed more than other assays
(57,72). Macronutrients have numerous functions in plants, and association of specific enzymatic
activity with deficiencies of macronutrients is difficult. However, some assays have been developed,
such  as  nitrate  reductase  activity  for  assessment  of  nitrogen  deficiency, glutamate-oxaloacetate
aminotransferase  for  phosphorus  deficiency, and  pyruvic  kinase  for  potassium  deficiency  (54).
Measurement of pyruvic kinase activity may also be useful for establishing the optimum balance
between potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations in tissues (73).

1.2.6 SOIL TESTS
A soil test is a chemical or physical measurement of soil properties based on a sample of soil (74).
Commonly, however, a soil test is considered as a rapid chemical analysis or quick test to assess the
readily extractable chemical elements of a soil. Interpretations of soil tests provide assessments of
the amount of available nutrients, which plants may absorb from a soil. Recommendations for fer-
tilization may be based on the results of soil tests. Chemical soil tests may also measure salinity,
pH, and presence of elements that may have inhibitory effects on plant growth.

A basic principle of soil testing is that an area can be sampled so that chemical analysis of the
samples will assess the nutrient status of the entire sampled area. Methods of sampling may differ with
the variability of the area being sampled and with the nutrients being tested. A larger number of sam-
ples may need to be taken from a nonuniform area than from a uniform area. Movement of nutrients
into the soil, as with nitrate leaching downward, may cause the need for sampling of soil to be at a
greater depth than with nutrients that do not move far from the site of application. Wide differences in
test results across a field bring into question whether a single recommendation for fertilization can be
made for the entire field (74,75). Fertilization of fields can increase the variability of nutrients of a
field, and the assessment of the fertility level with respect to nutrients will become more difficult.
Variations in patterns of applications of fertilizers, such as placement of fertilizers in bands in contrast
to broadcasting of fertilizers, can affect soil samples. The proceedings of an international conference
on  precision  agriculture  addressed  variability  in  fields, variable  lime  and  fertilizer  applications  in
fields, and other factors involved in site-specific collection of data, such as soil samples (76).

Results of soil tests must be calibrated to crop responses in the soil. Crop responses, such as growth
and yields, are obtained through experimentation. In the calibrations, the results of soil tests are treated
as  independent  variables  affecting  crop  growth  and  yields;  otherwise, all  other  variables  such  as
weather, season, diseases, soil types, weeds, and other environmental factors must be known and inter-
preted. The consideration of results of soil test as independent variables may impart difficulties in inter-
preting the results, especially if the environmental factors have marked effects on crop yields.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Results of soil analysis, sometimes called total analysis, in which soil mineral and organic mat-
ter are destroyed with strong mineral acids, heat, or other agents do not correlate well with crop
responses (77). Generally, soil tests involve determination of a form of a plant nutrient with which
a variation in amount is correlated with crop growth and yield. These forms of nutrients are com-
monly called available plant nutrients. The different forms of nutrients are extracted from the soil
with some solvent. Many different methods of extraction of soil samples are being used for meas-
urement of available nutrients in soils. Extractants are various combinations of water, acids, bases,
salts, and  chelating  agents  at  different  strengths. The  extractants  are  designed  to  extract  specific
nutrients  or  are  universal  extractants  (77–83).  Much  discussion  has  occurred  as  to  whether  one
method of extraction is better than another. Morgan (77) noted that any chemical method of soil
extraction is empirical and that the results give only an approximate quantitative expression of the
various chemical constituents in soil. Morgan stated further that no one solvent acting on the soil
for a period of minutes or hours will duplicate the conditions involved in provision of nutrients from
soil  to  plants.  Researchers  may  choose  to  continue  to  test  soils  with  extraction  procedures  with
which they have experience and for which they have compilations of results. Researchers who ana-
lyze only a relatively few samples may choose to use procedures for which published results are
readily  and  commonly  available.  Methods  of  extraction  and  analysis  for  specific  elements  are
addressed in several monographs and handbooks (84–86). Chemical analyses are the most accurate
part of soil testing since they are chemically reproducible or precise measurements of the amounts
of nutrients extracted from soils. Selection of the method of analysis depends largely on the facili-
ties that are available to scientists.

1.3 APPROACHES IN RESEARCH
Research in plant nutrition is a continuing program. The development of new crop varieties and the
introduction  of  new  management  practices  to  increase  crop  yields  impart  changes  in  nutrient
requirements of plants. The increasing application of genomics is providing more understanding of
the genetic basis for the efficiency with which different plants utilize nutrients. For example, a study
of induction of Arabidopsis genes by nitrate confirmed that genes encoding nitrate reductase, the
nitrate transporter NRT1 (but not the nitrate transporter NRT2), and glutamate synthase were all
highly induced, and this work also demonstrated induction of a further 15 genes that had not pre-
viously been shown to be induced (87). Nitrate influences root architecture through induction of
genes that control lateral root growth (88).

Research is conducted, and will continue to be conducted, to ensure that soil tests correlate with
use of nutrients by plants and that fertilizer recommendations are calibrated for crops (89). These
correlations  must  be  developed  for  individual  crops  and  different  land  areas.  Some  research  is
directed toward development of systems for evaluation of soil and crop conditions through methods
other than traditional soil and plant analysis. Much of the past and current research addresses chem-
ical, physical, and biological properties of soils (90,91). Some researchers have studied the interac-
tion of these quantitative aspects to determine soil quality and to develop a soil quality index that
correlates with crop productivity and environmental and health goals (92). Soil quality has been
defined to include productivity, sustainability, environmental quality, and effects on human nutri-
tion (93). To quantify soil quality, specific soil indicators are measured and integrated to form a soil
quality index. 

Research  in  plant  nutrition  addresses  methods  of  economically  and  environmentally  sound
methods of fertilization. Worldwide, large increases have occurred in the use of fertilizers because
of their effects on yields and availability. Traditionally, fertilizer use has followed Sprengel’s law of
the minimum, made famous by Liebig (94), and the application of the law of diminishing returns
by Mitscherlich (95). Applying these two laws has given us fertilizers with the nutrients blended in
the correct proportions for the world’s major crops and rates of fertilizer use that lead to maximum
yields commensurate with the cost of the fertilizer.

Introduction

More recently, interest has turned to issues related to the impact of this intensified agriculture
and fertilizer use on the environment and to greater interest in fertilizer use efficiency to help avoid
pollution of land and water resources (96). Research is conducted on dairy manure management to
protect water quality from nutrient pollution from the large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus
that may be added to heavily manured land (97,98). In its most extreme manifestation, this interest
in avoiding excessive fertilization of farmland has given rise to increased practice of organic farm-
ing, where  synthetic  inorganic  fertilizers  are  eschewed  in  favor  of  organic  sources  of  nutrients.
Regardless of whether nutrients are supplied from organic or synthetic sources, it is still the same
inorganic elements that plants are absorbing.

Research is conducted on the use of plants to clean metal-polluted land. Phytoextraction is
a plant-based technology to remove metals from contaminated sites through the use of metal-
accumulating  plants  (99,100).  Research  interests  have  focused  on  identifying  plants  that  will
accumulate metals and on methods of enhancing accumulation of metals in plants (101–103).
Another suggested use of knowledge about the uptake of mineral elements by plants is in the
identification of geographical origin of foodstuffs. Analysis of 18 elements in potato tubers has
been shown to give a distinctive signature that allows a sample to be correctly assigned to its
place of origin, something that could be of great use in tracing of foodstuffs (104).

Research also gives attention to the accumulation of elements that are beneficial in plant, ani-
mal, and human nutrition. Accumulation of selenium is addressed in research and in this handbook
(105,106). Chapters on aluminum, cobalt, and silicon discuss research on these elements.

Traditional soil testing provides information on patterns in soil fertility and management, and
plant vigor provides an indication of plant response to soil properties and management often based
on soil testing. Shortcomings of current soil testing methodology are the inability to predict yields,
large soil test spatial and temporal variability, inability to reflect dynamics of field parameters that
affect nutrient availability, lack of accurate tests for nutrient mineralization, and lack of accurate
nutrient response functions (107). 

Precision agriculture considers spatial variability across a field to optimize application of fer-
tilizer and other inputs on a site-specific basis (76,90,108–110). Precision agriculture employs tech-
nologies  of  global  positioning  and  geographic  information  systems  and  remote  sensing.  These
technologies permit decisions to be made in the management of crop-yield-limiting biotic and abi-
otic  factors  and  their  interactions  on  a  site-specific  basis  rather  than  on  a  whole-field  basis
(111–114).  Remote  sensing  is  a  term  applied  to  research  that  assesses  soil  fertility  and  plant
responses  through  means  other  than  on-the-ground  sampling  and  analysis  (115).  Research  has
applied video image analysis in monitoring plant growth to assess soil fertility and management
(116).  Spectral  reflection  and  digital  processing  of  aerial  photographs  have  been  researched  to
assess soil fertility (117). In precision agriculture, it is possible for the fertilizer spreader on the
back  of  a  tractor  to  operate  at  different  speeds  in  different  parts  of  a  field  in  response  to  data
obtained  on  the  growth  of  the  crop  underneath  and  stored  in  a  geographic  information  system.
These  data  may  have  been  obtained  by  remote  sensing, or  even  by  continuous  measurement  of
yields by the harvesting equipment operating in the same field at the previous harvest. The precise
location of the fertilizer spreader at any moment of time is monitored by global positioning.

2.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Discovery of the essentiality of nitrogen is often credited to de Saussure (1–3), who in 1804 recog-
nized that nitrogen was a vital constituent of plants, and that nitrogen was obtained mainly from the
soil. De Saussure noted that plants absorb nitrates and other mineral matter from solution, but not
in the proportions in which they were present in solution, and that plants absorbed substances that
were  not  required  for  plant  growth, even  poisonous  substances  (2).  Other  scientists  of  the  time
believed that nitrogen in plant nutrition came from the air. The scientists reasoned that if it was pos-
sible for plants to obtain carbon from the air, which is a mere 0.03% carbon dioxide (by volume),
then it would be easy for plants to obtain nitrogen from the air, which is almost 80% nitrogen gas.
Greening was observed in plants that were exposed to low levels of ammonia in air, further sug-
gesting that nitrogen nutrition came from the air. Liebig (1–3) wrote in the 1840s, at the time when
he killed the humus theory (the concept that plants obtain carbon from humus in soil rather than
from the air), that plants require water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and ash as constituents. Liebig
supported the theory that plants obtained nitrogen as ammonium from the air, and his failure to
include nitrogen in his “patent manure” was a weakness of the product. Plants will absorb ammo-
nia  at  low  concentrations  from  the  air, but  most  air  contains  unsubstantial  amounts  of  ammonia
relative to that which is needed for plant nutrition.

The concept that nitrogen was acquired from the air or from soil organic matter was dismissed
in the mid-1800s, as it was shown that crop yields rose as a result of fertilization of soil. Using lab-
oratory methods of de Saussure, Boussingault (1), in ﬁeld research of 1838, developed balances of
carbon, dry  matter, and  mineral  matter  in  crops.  Boussingault  established  a  special  position  for
legumes in nitrogen nutrition, a position that Liebig did not support (1). Other research also showed
that diﬀerent nitrogen fertilizers varied in their eﬀectiveness for supporting crop production, with
potassium nitrate often being a better fertilizer than ammonium salts (1). Microbial transformations
of nitrogen in the soil made it doubtful as to which source was actually the best and which form of
nitrogen entered into plants. Studies made with sterile media and in water culture demonstrated that
plants may utilize nitrate or ammonium and that one or the other might be superior depending on the
species and other conditions. At the time when much of this research was performed, organic fertil-
izers (farm manures) and gas-water (ammonia derived from coal gases) were the only ones that were
cost-eﬀective, considering the value of farm crops and the cost of the fertilizers. With the develop-
ment of the Haber process in 1909 for the synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gases,
ammonia could be made cheaply, leading to the development of the nitrogen fertilizer industry.

The recognition of the importance of nitrogen in plants predates much of the relatively modern-
day research of de Saussure and others. It was written as early as the 1660s and 1670s (1,3) that
plants beneﬁtted from nitre or saltpeter (potassium nitrate), that plants accumulated nitre, and that the
fertility of the land with respect to nitre aﬀected the quality of crops for storage and yields of sugar.

2.2 NITROGEN METABOLISM AND NITROGENOUS 

CONSTITUENTS IN PLANTS

Nitrogen has a wide range of valence states in compounds, which may be used in plant metabolism.
Although  some  compounds  have  oxidation–reduction  states  of  ⫹7, as  in  pernitric  acid, plant

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 23

Nitrogen

23

metabolites have oxidation–reduction states ranging from ⫹5 (nitric acid, nitrate) to ⫺3 (ammonia,
ammonium) (4). Organic, nitrogen-containing compounds are at the oxidation–reduction state of
nitrogen in ammonium (⫺3). Biologically important organic molecules in plants include proteins,
nucleic acids, purines, pyrimidines, and coenzymes (vitamins), among many other compounds.

2.2.1 NITRATE ASSIMILATION
Nitrate and ammonium are the major sources of nitrogen for plants. Under normal, aerated condi-
tions in soils, nitrate is the main source of nitrogen. Nitrate is readily mobile in plants and can be
stored in vacuoles, but for nitrate to be used in the synthesis of proteins and other organic com-
pounds in plants, it must be reduced to ammonium. Nitrate reductase converts nitrate into nitrite in
the nonorganelle portions of the cytoplasm (5,6). All living plant cells have the capacity to reduce
nitrate to nitrite, using the energy and reductant (NADH, NADPH) of photosynthesis and respira-
tion in green tissues and of respiration in roots and nongreen tissues (5). Nitrite reductase, which is
located in the chloroplasts, reduces nitrite into ammonium, utilizing the energy and reductant of
photosynthesis (reduced ferredoxin).

2.2.1.1 Nitrate Reductase

Nitrate ⫹ reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH, NADPH)

→ nitrite ⫹ oxidized pyridine nucleotides (NAD⫹, NADP⫹)

Nitrate reduction requires molybdenum as a cofactor. A two-electron transfer takes place to reduce
nitrate (N oxidation state, ⫹5) to nitrite (N oxidation state, ⫹3). Respiration is the likely source of
reduced pyridine nucleotides in roots and also, along with photosynthesis, can be a source in shoots.
The conversion of nitrite into ammonia is mediated by nitrite reductase, which is located in the

chloroplasts of green tissues and in the proplastids of roots and nongreen tissues (5,7,8).

2.2.1.2 Nitrite Reductase

Nitrite ⫹ reduced ferredoxin → ammonium ⫹ oxidized ferredoxin

In leaves, nitrite reduction involves the transfer of six electrons in the transformation of nitrite
to ammonium. No intermediates, such as hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) or hydroxylamine (HONH2),
are released, and the reduction takes place in one transfer. The large transfer of energy and reduc-
ing power required for this reaction is facilitated by the process being located in the chloroplasts
(8).  In  roots, a  ferredoxin-like  protein  may  function, and  the  energy  for  producing  the  reducing
potential is provided by glycolysis or respiration (9,10).

In  plants, roots  and  shoots  are  capable  of  nitrate  metabolism, and  the  proportion  of  nitrate
reduced in roots or shoots depends on plant species and age, nitrogen supply, temperature, and other
environmental factors (11–15).

The assimilation of nitrate is an energy-consuming process, using the equivalent of 15 mol of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for each mole of nitrate reduced (16). The assimilation of ammonia
requires an additional ﬁve ATP per mole. In roots, as much as 23% of the respiratory energy may be
used in nitrate assimilation compared with 14% for ammonium assimilation (17). However, nitrate
can be stored in cells without toxic eﬀects, but ammonium is toxic at even low concentrations and
must  be  metabolized  into  organic  combination.  Consequently, ammonium  metabolism  for
detoxiﬁcation may deplete carbon reserves of plants much more than nitrate accumulation.

2.2.2 AMMONIUM ASSIMILATION
The metabolism of ammonium into amino acids and amides is the main mechanism of assimilation
and detoxiﬁcation of ammonium. Glutamic acid formation is a port of entry of nitrogen into organic
compounds  and  occurs  in  the  chloroplasts  or  mitochondria.  Ammonium  assimilation  in  root

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 24

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

mitochondria  probably  uses  ammonium  absorbed  in  high  concentrations  from  nutrient  solutions.
One enzyme is involved in ammonium assimilation in mitochondria: glutamic acid dehydrogenase.
Ammonium assimilation in chloroplasts utilizes the ammonium that is formed from the reduction of
nitrite by nitrite reductase and that which is released in photorespiration. Two enzymes are involved
in chloroplasts, glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase. Glutamine synthetase forms glutamine
from ammonium and glutamate (glutamic acid). Glutamate synthase forms glutamate from gluta-
mine and α-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutaric acid). These enzymes are also active in roots and nodules
ﬁxation). These enzymes assimilate most of the ammonium derived from absorption from dilute
(N2
ﬁxation, or photorespiration (18–25). Further discussions of glut-
solutions, reduction of nitrate, N2
amine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamic acid dehydrogenase follow.

2.2.2.1 Glutamine Synthetase

Ammonium ⫹ glutamate ⫹ ATP ⫹ reduced ferredoxin → glutamine ⫹ oxidized ferredoxin

2.2.2.2 Glutamate Synthase

Glutamine ⫹ α-oxoglutarate → 2 glutamate

Sum (or net): Ammonium ⫹ α-oxoglutarate ⫹ ATP ⫹ reduced ferredoxin

→ glutamate ⫹ oxidized ferredoxin

Glutamine synthetase has a high aﬃnity for ammonium and thus can assimilate ammonium at
low concentrations, such as those that occur from the reduction of nitrate. If this enzyme is inhib-
ited, however, ammonium may accumulate to phytotoxic levels. Ammonium accumulation to toxic
levels from the inhibition of glutamine synthetase is the mode of action of the herbicide glufosinate
ammonium (26,27).

2.2.2.3 Glutamic Acid Dehydrogenase
Ammonium ⫹ α-oxoglutarate ⫹ ATP ⫹ reduced pyridine nucleotide (NADH, NADPH)

→ glutamate ⫹ oxidized pyridine nucleotide (NAD⫹, NADP⫹)
Another  pathway  for  ammonium  assimilation  into  organic  compounds  is  by  glutamic  acid
dehydrogenase, which is located in the mitochondria (28). Glutamic acid dehydrogenase has a low
aﬃnity for ammonium and becomes important in ammonium assimilation at high concentrations of
ammonium and at low pH in growth media (15).

2.2.2.4 Transamination

Glutamate ⫹ α-oxyacid → α-oxoglutarate ⫹ α-amino acid

Ammonium that is assimilated into glutamate from mitochondrial or chloroplastic assimila-
tion  can  be  transferred  by  aminotransferases  (transaminases)  to  an  appropriate α-oxyacid  (α-
ketoacid)  to  form  an  α-amino  acid.  The  transfer  can  also  be  to  other  keto-groups  on  carbon
chains to form, for example, γ- or δ-amino acids. The keto acids for the synthesis of amino acids
are  derived  from  photosynthesis, glycolysis, and  the  tricarboxylic  acid  cycle, among  other
processes.

2.2.2.5 Amidation

Glutamate ⫹ ammonium ⫹ ATP → glutamine ⫹ ADP

Amides are formed by the amidation of carboxyl groups. Amides are nitrogen-rich compounds
that  can  store  or  transport  nitrogen.  Common  amides  are  glutamine  (5C, 2N)  and  asparagine

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 25

Nitrogen

25

(4C, 2N).  Glutamine  is  formed  from  amidation  of  glutamic  acid  (glutamate), and  asparagine  is
formed by amidation of aspartic acid (aspartate). Often, when the external supply of ammonium is
high, asparagine, a metabolite unique to plants, will dominate among the amides, as plants respond
to conserve carbon in the detoxiﬁcation of ammonium.

2.2.3 PROTEINS AND OTHER NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS
Unlike  animals, plants  do  not  eliminate  nitrogen  from  their  bodies  but  reuse  nitrogen  from  the
cycling of proteins and other nitrogenous constituents. Nitrogen losses from plants occur mainly by
leaching of foliage by rain or mist and by leaf drop (29). Nitrogen in plants is recycled as ammo-
nium. In the case of hydrolysis (breakdown) of proteins, the amino acids of proteins do not accu-
mulate, but rather nitrogen-rich storage compounds (amides, arginine, and others) accumulate as
reserves of nitrogen at the oxidation–reduction level of ammonium. These compounds are formed
from the catabolism of proteins. The carbon and hydrogen of proteins are released as carbon diox-
ide and water. These nitrogen-rich products also accumulate if accumulation of nitrogenous com-
pounds occurs in excess of their conversion into proteins. The amino acids that enter into proteins
are not mingled with the storage reserves or translocated products but are made at the same site
where protein synthesis occurs. The carbon framework (carbon skeletons) remaining after the dona-
tion of nitrogen (ammonium) for amino acid synthesis for incorporation into proteins is metabolized
into  carbon  dioxide  and  water. Thus, the  products  of  protein  catabolism  are  ammonium, carbon
dioxide, and water. Protein turnover (breakdown and resynthesis) may occur in plants in a diurnal
cycle, with synthesis occurring in the light and breakdown occurring in the dark, or anabolism and
catabolism of proteins may proceed in diﬀerent compartments of the same cell at the same time
(29–31). In a 24-h period, one quarter of the protein in a healthy leaf may be newly synthesized as
a result of protein turnover. Most authors indicate a protein turnover of 0.1 to 2% per hour (32,33).
With Lemma minor, Trewavas (34,35) measured turnover rates of 7% per day. In an excised leaf,
protein  synthesis  does  not  proceed  after  protein  hydrolysis, and  soluble  nitrogenous  compounds
accumulate. In a nitrogen-deﬁcient plant, the nitrogen will be translocated to a site of need. Also,
under  normal  conditions, leaves  will  donate  some  of  their  nitrogen  in  leaf  proteins  to  fruits  and
seeds.

Amino acids are assimilated into proteins or other polypeptides (28). Although plants contain
more than 100 amino acids (1,29), only about 20 enter into proteins (Table 2.1). Hydroxyproline
may be formed after incorporation of proline into proteins. Cystine is the dimer of cysteine and is
formed  after  incorporation  of  cysteine  into  protein. Animal  proteins  occasionally  contain  amino
acids other than those listed in Table 2.1.

The major portion of nitrogen in plants is in proteins, which contain about 85% of the total
nitrogen in plants (Table 2.2). Nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) contain about 5% of the total nitrogen,
and 5 to 10% of the total nitrogen is in low-molecular-weight, water-soluble, organic compounds
of various kinds (36).

Some of the low-molecular-weight, water-soluble, organic compounds are intermediates in the
metabolism of nitrogen. Some have speciﬁc roles in processes other than intermediary metabolism.
Amides and amino acids have roles in transport and storage of nitrogen in addition to their occurrence
in proteins. Ureides (allantoin and allantoic acid) are prominent in xylem sap and transport nitrogen
ﬁxed in root nodules of legumes (15,29). Amines (ethanolamine) and polyamines (putrescine, sper-
mine, spermidine) have been assigned roles or have putative roles in the lipid fraction of membranes,
as  protectants, and  in  processes  involved  in  plant  growth  and  development  (15,37–43).  Putrescine
accumulation in plants may be a physiological response to stresses such as the form of nitrogen sup-
plied and the nutrient status of plants (39,44–46). Simple nitrogen bases, such as choline, are related
to alkaloids in plants and to lipids (29). Analogs of purines and pyrimidines have functions in growth
regulation (29). Various amino acids other than those in proteins exist in plants. Often, the nonprotein
amino acids are related to those occurring in proteins. β-Alanine, homoserine, and γ-aminobutyric acid
are common examples of these amino acids (1,29). Accumulation of amino acids such as ornithine and
citrulline is generally rare in plants, but they may be the major soluble nitrogenous constituents of
some species (1). Nonprotein amino acids may be natural products or metabolites, but their functions
are generally unclear.

2.3 DIAGNOSIS OF NITROGEN STATUS IN PLANTS

2.3.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY AND EXCESS
A shortage of nitrogen restricts the growth of all plant organs, roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers, and
fruits (including seeds). A nitrogen-deﬁcient plant appears stunted because of the restricted growth
of the vegetative organs. Nitrogen-deﬁcient foliage is a pale color of light green or yellow (Figure
2.1). Loss of green color is uniform across the leaf blade. If a plant has been deﬁcient throughout
its life cycle, the entire plant is pale and stunted or spindly. If the deﬁciency develops during the
growth cycle, the nitrogen will be mobilized from the lower leaves and translocated to young leaves
causing the lower leaves to become pale colored and, in the case of severe deﬁciency, to become
brown (ﬁring) and abscise. Until the 1940s crops received little nitrogen fertilizer (a typical appli-
cation of N was 2 or 3 kg/ha), and when the light green color and ﬁring appeared, farmers assumed
that the soil was droughty (47). Sometimes under conditions of suﬃciency of nitrogen, leaves, espe-
cially the lower ones, will provide nitrogen to fruits and seeds, and symptoms of deﬁciency may
develop on the leaves. These symptoms, which develop late in the growing season, may not be evi-
dence of yield-limiting deﬁciencies but are expressions of transport of nitrogen from old leaves to

other portions of the plant. For additional information on nitrogen-deﬁciency symptoms, readers
should consult Cresswell and Weir (48–50), Weir and Cresswell (51,52) or Sprague (53).

At least 25%, more commonly more than 75%, of the nitrogen in leaves is contained in the
chloroplasts (29,54). Most of the nitrogen of chloroplasts is in enzymatic proteins in the stroma and
lamellae. Chlorophyll and proteins exist in lamellae as complexes referred to as chlorophyll pro-
teins or holochromes (55–59). Nitrogen-deﬁcient chloroplasts may be circular in proﬁle rather than
elliptical and may appear swollen. Nitrogen deﬁciency generally brings about a decrease in protein
in chloroplasts and a degradation of chloroplast ﬁne (lamellar) structure (60). Almost all membra-
nous structure may be disrupted. Grana are often reduced in number or are indistinguishable. The
loss of membranous structures is associated with the loss of proteins (61). A loss of chlorophyll
occurs simultaneously with the loss of membranes and proteins, leading to the loss of green color
from nitrogen-deﬁcient leaves.

The  loss  of  ﬁne  structure  in  chloroplasts  during  nutrient  deﬁciency  is  not  unique  to  nitrogen
deﬁciency. Association of chloroplast aberrations with speciﬁc nutritional disorders has been diﬃcult
because of similarities in appearance of nutrient-deﬁcient chloroplasts (62,63). The similarities are
due to the eﬀects that the deﬁciencies have on protein or chlorophyll synthesis (64,65). Elemental
toxicities can also impart structural changes that resemble elemental deﬁciencies in chloroplasts (66).

2.3.2 CONCENTRATIONS OF NITROGEN IN PLANTS
Many attempts have been made to relate yields of crops to nutrient supply in media and to accu-
mulation in plants. Deﬁciency of nitrogen or another nutrient is associated with suboptimum devel-
opment of a plant, as reﬂected by the appearance of symptoms of deﬁciency, the suppression of
yields, or  to  the  response  of  plants  after  the  accumulation  of  the  deﬁcient  nutrient  following  its
application  as  a  fertilizer.  Plant  analysis  (tissue  testing)  is  used  in  the  diagnosis  of  nutritional
deﬁciency, suﬃciency, or excess. Generally, the concentrations of nitrogen in plants reﬂect the sup-
ply  of  nitrogen  in  the  root  medium, and  yields  increase  as  internal  concentration  of  nitrogen  in
plants increases. The use of information on internal concentrations of nitrogen in plants should not
be directed toward forecasting of yields as much as it should be used in assessing how yields can
be improved by fertilization.

Various models have been developed to describe the response of plants to nutrient supply and
accumulation (67). Pfeiﬀer et al. (68) proposed a hyperbolic model in which plants approached an
asymptote or maximum value as nutrient accumulation increased. Linear models have been pro-
posed to describe growth responses to nutrient accumulation (67). Other researchers identiﬁed a
three-phase model (69–71) (Figure 2.2). In this model, growth curves describe a deﬁcient level of
nutrient accumulation, region of poverty adjustment, or minimum percentage where yields rise with
increasing internal concentrations of nitrogen. In the second zone of the growth curve, a transition
from deﬁciency to suﬃciency occurs followed by a region known as luxury consumption in which
internal concentration of nitrogen rises but yield does not rise. The concentration of nitrogen at the
transition from deﬁciency to suﬃciency is known as the critical concentration. Eventually, nitrogen
accumulation will rise to excessive or toxic levels.

Nitrogen concentrations in plants vary with species and with varieties within species (72,73).
Nitrogen accumulation in plants also varies among families. Herbaceous crops from fertilized ﬁelds
commonly have concentrations of nitrogen that exceed 3% of the dry mass of mature leaves. Leaves
of grasses (Gramineae, Poaceae) (1.5 to 3.5% N) are typically lower in total nitrogen concentrations

than those of legumes (Leguminosae, Fabaceae) (⬎3% N). Leaves of trees and woody ornamentals
may have ⬍1.5% N in mature leaves. Genetic diﬀerences attributable to species or families are due
to many factors aﬀecting absorption and metabolism of nitrogen and plant growth in general.

The concentrations of nitrogen in leaves, stems, and roots changes during the growing season.
In the early stages of growth, concentrations will be high throughout the plant. As plants mature the
concentrations of nitrogen in these organs fall, and is usually independent of the initial external sup-
ply of nitrogen. Mobilization of nitrogen from old leaves to meristems, young leaves, and fruits
leads to a diminished concentration of nitrogen in old, bottom leaves of plants. Whether a plant is
annual, biennial, or perennial aﬀects considerations of yield relations and the state of nutrient accu-
mulation in organs (leaves) during the season. If the development of a plant is restricted by low lev-
els  of  external  factors, such  as  other  nutrients, water, or  temperature, internal  concentration  of
nitrogen may rise. Root structure and metabolism can lead to diﬀerential accumulation of nitrogen.
Assimilation and transport of nitrogenous compounds in plants can lead to diﬀerential accumula-
tion among species and within the plants. Nitrogen sources can have large eﬀects on total nitrogen
concentrations in plants. Plants grown on ammonium nutrition can have twice the nitrogen concen-
trations in vegetative parts as plants grown on nitrate nutrition.

The choice of tissue for plant analysis is important in plant diagnosis (Table 2.3). Generally,
leaves are the most satisfactory plant part to use for diagnosis (69,72,74). Blades are used more fre-
quently than leaf petioles or whole leaves. Blades are chosen as the diagnostic part if total nitrogen
is to be assessed, whereas petioles may be selected if the nitrogenous component is soluble, such as
nitrate. Total nitrogen quantity in tissues is the most commonly measured fraction, although some
researchers believe that nitrate contents reﬂect the nutritional status better than total nitrogen.

2.3.2.1 Concentrations of Nitrogen in Plant Parts

With a nutrient supply in which all elements except nitrogen are held at a constant high level, the con-
centration of nitrogen in a plant will be expected to rise, along with growth and yields, with increases
in nitrogen supply. Nitrogen concentrations in leaves are often not correlated with increased growth
and yields. Shortages of other nutrients or stresses imposed by growth-limiting temperatures or water
supply can cause concentrations of total nitrogen or nitrate to increase, along with a suppression of
yield (75). The age of plant tissues is important in diagnosis of nitrogen suﬃciency. In the early stages
of plant growth, the concentration of nitrogen in plants will be higher than at the later stages. Increased
external concentrations of nitrogen will increase the concentration of nitrogen in plant organs, but the
trend is for nitrogen concentrations to fall in leaves, stems, and roots as plants mature. These changes
will vary with whether the plant is annual, biennial, or perennial (67). It is important to sample plants
for nitrogen determinations at a given time of the year or stage of plant development. Some researchers
recommend that samples be taken at a certain time of the day, since light intensity and duration can

aﬀect the amount of nitrate in tissues (76). Nutrient concentrations in leaves can vary by as much as
40% during a diurnal period (67). Nitrate can vary with time of day, with lower concentrations occur-
ring in the afternoon than in the morning.

Analysis of whole shoots may be the best index of the nutritional status of plants even though
each organ of a plant will vary in nitrogen concentrations. Since organs of plants vary in composi-
tion and since the proportions of organs vary with the nitrogen status of plants, a particular organ of
a plant is usually chosen for analysis. Conducting tissue, such as that of stems or petioles, may pro-
vide the best index of the response of plants to nutrient applications or the best index of the nutrient
status at a given time in growth. Nitrate concentrations in corn (Zea mays L.) stalks are usually sev-
eral times higher than those of leaves (77). Measurement of nitrate in the lower stalk of corn is valu-
able in the diagnosis of the nitrogen status of the crop (78–80). Brouder et al. (79) noted that analysis
of grain for total nitrogen was as good as the stalk test in determining suﬃciency or deﬁciency of
corn. Leaf petioles as conducting tissues are often analyzed to assess the nutritional status of veg-
etable crops (81). Leaves are often taken as samples for nitrogen determinations since they are the
organs of active assimilation and hence likely to be the best for analysis to reﬂect the nutrient status
of the whole plant. Leaf samples can be taken conveniently in nondestructive harvests of plants, and
leaves can be identiﬁed by position or stage of development on plants. Random sampling of leaves
is not as good a technique as sampling based on position on plant, size, and age. Nitrogen is a mobile
element in plants; hence, it moves from lower leaves to upper leaves, and analysis of lower leaves
might be a better index of deﬁciency than analysis of upper leaves. Sometimes, young leaves or the
ﬁrst-fully expanded leaves are chosen for analysis because of convenience in identifying the sample
and because the lower leaves might be dead or contaminated with soil. Deﬁcient, suﬃcient, and high
concentrations of nitrogen in the leaves of plants are reported in Table 2.4.

2.3.2.2 Ratios of Concentrations of Nitrogen to Other Nutrients in Plants

The critical concentration (see Section 2.3.2) of nitrogen is the value in a particular plant part sam-
pled at a given growth stage below which plant growth and yield are suppressed by 5 or 10% (82).
The responses of plants to nutrient additions are essentially independent of the source of nutrients;
hence, the symptoms and nutrient concentrations of aﬀected tissues, and relationships to growth and
yields, are identical regardless of the growth medium or location. Therefore, the critical concentra-
tion is proposed to have universal application to media and geographic locations (82). However,
since leaf (tissue) composition varies with age, the critical concentration can vary and be insensitive

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 32

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

or inﬂexible to diagnosis of nutrient deﬁciency (83). For example, if a leaf sample is taken at an
early plant-growth stage, the concentration of nitrogen may exceed the critical concentration that
was determined for tissue at a later stage of growth. Likewise, a sample taken at a late stage of
growth might mistakenly be diagnosed as indicating a deﬁciency of nitrogen. To deal with the prob-
lem of variable critical concentrations with plant age, several sets of critical values are needed, one
for each growth stage. Determinations of critical concentrations are diﬃcult because of the many
observations that must be made of growth and yield in response to nutrient concentrations in leaves.
Hence, few critical concentrations have been determined at one growth stage, not considering that
multiple stages should be assessed. Applications of suﬃciency ranges, such as those reported (Table
2.4), are often too wide to be used for precise diagnoses.

The Diagnostic and Recommendations Integrated System (DRIS) was developed to assess plant
nutrition without regard to variety, age, or position of leaves on plants (83,84). The DRIS method con-
siders nutrient balance and utilizes ratios of nutrient concentrations in leaves to determine the relative
suﬃciency of nutrients (85). The DRIS method diﬀers from standard diagnostic methods in the inter-
pretation of analytical results based on the concentrations of individual elements. Instead of consider-
ing each nutrient concentration independently, DRIS evaluates nutrient relationships that involve ratios
between pairs of nutrients and evaluates the adequacy of a nutrient in relation to others. Generation of
the DRIS index yields positive and negative numbers, which are deviations from a norm and which sum
to zero for all nutrients considered. DRIS norms are standard values suggested to have universal appli-
cation to a crop. Norms are determined by research and have been published for several crops (86).

The optimum range for plant DRIS indices is ⫺15 to 15. If the index is below ⫺15, that ele-
ment  is  considered  to  be  deﬁcient.  If  the  index  is  above  15, that  element  is  considered  to  be  in
excess. DRIS indices must be interpreted in comparison with other nutrients. A negative number
does not indicate that a nutrient is deﬁcient, but it may be used to compare relative deﬁciencies
among nutrients. DRIS may be useful in identifying hidden hunger or imbalances. For example, if
nitrogen had an index of ⫺12, phosphorus an index of ⫺8, and potassium an index of 6, the order
of likely growth-limiting eﬀects would be nitrogen ⬎ phosphorus ⬎ potassium. Variations in DRIS
(M-DRIS or modiﬁed DRIS) consider dry matter in generation of indices (87,88).

2.4 NITROGEN IN SOILS

2.4.1 FORMS OF NITROGEN IN SOILS
The total nitrogen of the Earth is about 1.67 ⫻ 1023 g (89,90). Stevenson (89,90) reported that about
98% of the nitrogen of the Earth is in the lithosphere (rocks, soil, coal, sediments, core, sea bottom).
About 2% of the nitrogen is in the atmosphere, with the portions in the hydrosphere and biosphere
being insigniﬁcant relative to that in the lithosphere and atmosphere. Most of the nitrogen of the
Earth, including the nitrogen in the rocks and in the atmosphere, is not available for plant nutrition.
The nitrogen in soils, lakes, streams, sea bottoms, and living organisms is only about 0.02% of the
total nitrogen of the Earth (89,90). Plants obtain most of their nitrogen nutrition from the soil. The
nitrogen in the soil is about 2.22 ⫻ 1017 g, most of which is in soil organic matter and which is a
negligible component of the total nitrogen content of the world (89,90). Living organisms (bios-
phere) contain about 2.8 ⫻ 1017 g of nitrogen. The nitrogen of living organisms and of the soil is in
a constant state of ﬂux, with some forms of nitrogen being readily transformed in this group and
some  forms  being  inactive  over  a  long  time  (91). Transformations  are  insignificant  in  the  litho-
sphere and atmosphere. The amount of interchange of nitrogen among the lithosphere (not includ-
ing soil), atmosphere, and living organisms is very small.

The total amount of nitrogen in the soil to the depth of plowing is considerable relative to the
amounts required for crop production, often above 3000 kg/ha but ranging from 1600 kg/ha in sands
through 8100 kg/ha in black clay loams to 39,000 kg/ha in deep peats (Table 2.5) (92). Note that the
nitrogen in the atmosphere above a hectare of land exceeds 100 million kg at sea level. When land is

put for crop production, the nitrogen content of soils declines to a new equilibrium value (90,92). Crop
production that relies on the reserves of nitrogen cannot be eﬀective for long, as the reserves become
exhausted. Most plants cannot tap into the large reserve of nitrogen in the atmosphere, although bio-
logical nitrogen ﬁxation is a means of enhancing the nitrogen content of soils. Biological nitrogen
ﬁxation is the principal means of adding nitrogen to the soil from the atmosphere (89). More than 70%
of the atmospheric nitrogen added or returned to soils is by biological ﬁxation, and can exceed 100 kg
of nitrogen addition per year by nitrogen-ﬁxing legumes. Most of this nitrogen enters into the organic
fraction of the soils. Unless nitrogen-ﬁxing legumes are grown, the addition of nitrogen to soils by bio-
logical  ﬁxation, averaging  about  9.2 kg/ha  annually, is  too  small  to  support  crop  production.  The
remainder  is  from  atmospheric  precipitation  of  ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and  organically  bound
nitrogen (terrestrial dust). The amount of nitrogen precipitated is normally too small to support crop
production but might be of signiﬁcance in natural landscapes (90). Virtually no interchange of nitro-
gen occurs between rocks and soils.

2.4.1.1 Organic Nitrogen in Soil

The concentrations of nitrogen range from 0.02% in subsoils to 2.5% in peats (93). Nitrogen con-
centrations in soils generally fall sharply with depth, with most of the nitrogen being in the top one-
meter  layer  of  soils  (89).  Surface  layers  (A-horizon, plow-depth  zone)  of  cultivated  soils  have
between 0.08 and 0.4% nitrogen. Well over 90%, perhaps over 98%, of the nitrogen in the surface
layers (A-horizon, plow-depth zone) of soil is in organic matter (93,94). Since most of the nitrogen
in soil is organic, determination of total nitrogen has been a common method of estimating organic
nitrogen. The Kjeldahl method, a wet digestion procedure (93,95,96), provides a good estimate of
organic, soil  nitrogen  in  surface  soils, even  though  some  forms  of  nitrogen  (ﬁxed  ammonium,
nitrates, nitrites, some organic forms) are not determined by this analysis. In depths below the
A-horizon or plow zone, although the amounts of total nitrogen are small, inorganic nitrogen, par-
ticularly ﬁxed ammonium, is a high proportion of the total, perhaps 40%, and results from Kjeldahl
analysis should be treated with some caution as this fraction would not be determined (93). The
Dumas method, a dry digestion procedure, is seldom used for determination of nitrogen in soils but

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 34

34

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

generally gives results in close agreement with Kjeldahl determinations, if certain precautions are
taken in the analysis (93).

Soil organic matter is a complex mixture of compounds in various states of decay or stability (97).
Soil organic matter may be classiﬁed into humic and nonhumic fractions, with no sharp demarcation
between the two fractions. The partially decayed or nonhumic portion is the major source of energy
for soil organisms. Depending on the nature of the plant materials, about half of fresh plant residues
added to soil decompose in a few weeks or months (98,99). Humus, or humic substances, are the
degradation products or residues of microbial action on organic matter and are more stable than the
nonhumic substances. Humus is classiﬁed into three fractions, humin, humic acids, and fulvic acids,
based on their solubilities. Humin is the highest molecular weight material and is virtually insoluble
in dilute alkali or in acid. Humic acids are alkali-soluble and acid-insoluble. Fulvic acids are alkali-
or acid-soluble. The humic and fulvic fractions are the major portions, perhaps 90%, of the humic soil
organic matter and are the most chemically reactive substances in humus (100). Humus is slow to
mineralize, and unless present in large quantities may contribute little to plant nitrogen nutrition in
most soils. About 60 to 75% of the mineralized nitrogen may be obtained by a crop (99). The turnover
rate of nitrogen in humus may be about 1 to 3% of the total nitrogen of the soil, varying with type
of soil, climate, cultivation, and other factors (93,99). The mineralization rate is likely to be closer to
1% than to 3%. Bremner (96) and Stanford (101) discussed several methods to assess availability of
organic nitrogen in soils. Among these procedures were biochemical methods (estimation of micro-
bial growth, mineral nitrogen formed, or carbon dioxide released) and chemical methods (estimation
of soil total nitrogen, mineral nitrogen, and organic matter and application of various extraction pro-
cedures). The chemical methods are applied more commonly than the biological methods in the esti-
mation of mineralization. Correlation of crop yields to estimations of mineralization generally have
not been satisfactory in the assessment of the potential for soils to supply nitrogen for crop growth.

Most studies on the fractionation of total soil organic matter have dealt with the hydrolysis of
nitrogenous components with hot acids (3 or 6 M hydrochloric acid for 12 to 24 h) (Table 2.6). The
fraction that is not hydrolyzed is called the acid-insoluble nitrogen. The acid-soluble nitrogen is
fractionated into ammonium, amino acid, amino sugar, and unidentiﬁed components. The origins
and composition of each of the named fractions are not clear. The absolute values vary with soil
type and with cultivation (94). All of these forms of nitrogen, including the acid-stable form, appear
to be biodegradable and, hence, to contribute to plant nutrition (94,102). Organic matter that is held
to clays is recalcitrant to biodegradation and increases in relative abundance in heavily cropped soils
(94,103,104). This fraction may have little importance in nitrogen nutrition of plants.

Cultivation reduces the total amount of organic matter in soils but has little eﬀect on the rela-
tive distribution of the organic fractions in soils, suggesting that the results of acid hydrolysis are of
little value as soil tests for available nitrogen or for predicting crop yields (94). Humic substances
contain about the same forms of nitrogen that are obtained from the acid hydrolysis of soils but per-
haps in diﬀerent distribution patterns (94). Agricultural systems that depend on soil reserves do not
remain productive without the input of fertilizer nitrogen.

2.4.1.2 Inorganic Nitrogen in Soil

Soil inorganic nitrogen is commonly less than 2% of the total nitrogen of surface soils and under-
goes rapid changes in composition and quantity. Inorganic nitrogen varies widely among soils, with
climate, and  with  weather.  In  humid, temperate  zones, soil  inorganic  nitrogen  in  surface  soil  is
expected  to  be  low  in  winter, to  increase  in  spring  and  summer, and  to  decrease  with  fall  rains,
which move the soluble nitrogen into the depths of the soil (105). Despite being small in magni-
tude, the inorganic fraction is the source of nitrogen nutrition for plants. Unless supplied by fertil-
izers, inorganic nitrogen in soil is derived from the soil organic matter, which serves as a reserve of
nitrogen for plant nutrition. Plant-available nitrogen is released from organic matter by mineraliza-
tion and is transformed back into organic matter (microbial cells) by immobilization. Absorption by
plants is the chief means of removal of inorganic nitrogen from soils, although nitrate leaching and
denitriﬁcation, ammonium volatilization and ﬁxation, and nitrogen immobilization lead to losses of
inorganic nitrogen from soils or from the soil solution (105).

Detectable inorganic nitrogen forms in soil are nitrate, nitrite, exchangeable and ﬁxed ammo-
nium, nitrogen (N2) gas, and nitrous oxide (N2O gas) (106). Nitrate and exchangeable ammonium
are important in plant nutrition. The other forms are generally not available for plant nutrition. Fixed
ammonium, entrapped in clays, is a principal nitrogenous constituent of subsoils and is probably
derived from parent rock materials; however, the ﬁxed ammonium in surface soils may be of recent
origin from organic matter (106). Fixed ammonium is resistant to removal from clay lattices and
has little importance in plant nutrition. The gaseous constituents diﬀuse from the atmosphere or
arise from denitriﬁcation and have no role in plant nutrition, other than in considerations of losses
of nitrogen from soils (107).

Exchangeable or dissolved ammonium is available to plants, but ammonium concentrations in
soils are low, usually in a magnitude of a few mg/kg or kg/ha. In well-aerated soils, ammonium is
oxidized rapidly to nitrate by nitriﬁcation, so that nitrate is the major source of plant-available nitro-
gen in soil (108,109). Nitrite, an intermediate in nitriﬁcation, is oxidized more rapidly than ammo-
nium (109). Hence, little ammonium or nitrite accumulates in most soils. Ammonium and nitrite are
toxic  to  most  plants  (110). Toxicity  of  ammonium  or  nitrite  might  occur  if  the  concentration  of
either rises above 50 mg N/kg in soil or in other media, especially if either is the principal source
of nitrogen for plant nutrition (110,111). Nitriﬁcation is sensitive to soil acidity and is likely to be
inhibited in soils under pH 5; this acidity may lead to ammonium accumulation (108).

2.5 SOIL TESTING FOR NITROGEN
Testing for plant-available soil nitrogen is diﬃcult. This diﬃculty arises in part because most of
the nitrogen in soil is in organic forms, which have varying rates of microbial transformation into
available  forms. Also, nitrate, the  main  form  of  plant-available  nitrogen, is  subject  to  leaching,
denitriﬁcation, and immobilization. Many attempts have been made to develop availability indexes
for release of nitrogen from organic matter and to correlate yields with tests for inorganic nitrogen
in soils (93,101,112–114). Biological tests are time consuming and may give variable results if the
methodology is not standardized among researchers. Chemical tests for estimating plant-available
nitrogen have been empirical in approach and have had low correlations with production of min-
eral nitrogen and crop accumulation of nitrogen.

2.5.1 DETERMINATIONS OF TOTAL NITROGEN
The determination of nitrogen by the Kjeldahl method gives an estimation of the total nitrogen in
soils (93,113). This test, often considered a chemical index, is essentially a test for total soil organic
matter, since the nitrogen concentration of soil organic matter is relatively constant. This measure-
ment does not estimate the rates of transformations of organic nitrogen into inorganic forms that are
available  for  plants;  hence, many  irregularities  in  predicting  available  nitrogen  occur  in  its  use.
However, considering that transformations depend on the type of organic matter, temperature, aer-
ation, water supply, acidity, and other factors, total nitrogen is likely as informative as determina-
tion  of  other  availability  indexes.  Nevertheless, determinations  of  availability  indexes  have  been
investigated extensively (96).

2.5.2 BIOLOGICAL DETERMINATIONS OF AVAILABILITY INDEXES
Aerobic incubation of soil samples for 2 to 4 weeks under nearly optimum conditions of microbial
decomposition  of  organic  matter  and  measurements  of  nitrogen  mineralization  is  an  extensively
employed  biological  procedure for  the  development  of  an  availability  index  (96,101,112–114).
Incubated samples are tested for the amounts of nitrate, ammonium, or both forms released. Since
determinations are run under nearly optimum conditions, only an estimate of the potential for min-
eralization  is  provided.  Results  may  diﬀer  from  mineralization  in  a  ﬁeld  in  a  particular  year.
Determinations  of  indexes  by  anaerobic  incubation  involve  estimations  of  ammonium  released
(115). Other biological tests involve bioassays of microbial growth or pigment production (116),
chlorophyll production by algae (117), and carbon dioxide production (118).

2.5.2.1 Determination of Inorganic Nitrogen

These determinations are considered to be chemical indexes of availability of nitrogen soil organic
matter. The utility of chemical indexes depends on their correlation for a broad range of soils with bio-
logical criteria, such as crop yields, nitrogen accumulation in plants, and biological indexes (101).
Inorganic nitrogen is determined in an extraction of soil with water or solutions of acids, bases, chelat-
ing  agents, or  salts  at  diﬀering  concentrations  and  temperatures  (101).  Severe  extractants, such  as
moderately concentrated (4.5 to 6 M) boiling mineral acids or bases, generally give nitrogen releases
that correlate well with total soil nitrogen. However, total soil nitrogen as such is not a reliable index
of nitrogen availability in soils. Also, release of nitrogen by moderate extraction procedures, such as
alkaline permanganate, sodium carbonate, and molar solutions of mineral acids and bases, generally
are poorly correlated with biological measurements (96,101). Relatively mild extractions with cold,
hot, or boiling water or solutions of cold dilute (0.01 M) acids, bases, or salts have been used with the
premise that these methods determine nitrogen of which a high proportion is derived from microbial
action on the soils (101). Ammonium or nitrate may be determined in the extracts (96,105,106).

2.5.2.1.1 Ammonium
The  rate-controlling  step  in  nitrogen  mineralization  is  the  conversion  of  organic  nitrogen  into
ammonium. The conversion of ammonium into nitrate is a rapid step, as a result ammonium gener-
ally does not accumulate in well-drained mineral soils. Ammonium in soil, initially present in soils
at sampling, is correlated weakly with nitrogen accumulation in plants (113). Temperatures in han-
dling and storage of soil samples are important in judging the correlation between ammonium in
soils  and  accumulation  in  plants  (119).  Waterlogging, high  acidity  (pH ⬍ 5.0)  or  alkalinity
(pH ⬎ 8.0), or use of nitriﬁcation inhibitors can lead to mineralization that stops with the formation
of  ammonium  and  hence  to  accumulation  beyond  that  occurring  in  well-drained, mineral  soils.
Determination of ammonium present in soil without any manipulation generally gives better corre-
lations with biological processes than the correlation of ammonium that accumulates with manipu-
lation of processes that lead to ammonium accumulation.

2.5.2.1.2 Nitrate
Nitrate is the form of nitrogen that is used most commonly by plants and that may accumulate in
agricultural soils. In combination with other factors, such as soil water, nitrate concentrations in
soils have been used in assessments of soil fertility since the early 1900s (113,120–122). Ozus and
Hanway  (123)  reported  that  nitrogen  accumulation  in  crops  during  early  growth  was  related  to
nitrate content in soils. Early workers related nitrate in soils to crop yields. Nitrate in soil was shown
to be a reliable evaluation of soil nitrogen that is residual from previous fertilization (124–126).
Recent work has related tests for nitrate in soils to prediction of the needs of crops for nitrogen fer-
tilization. These  tests  are  commonly  called  preplant  nitrate  tests and  are  conducted  in  the  early
spring to a soil-sampling depth of 60, 90, 120 cm, or greater.

Nitrate is a soluble form of nitrogen that is subject to downward movement in soils in humid
temperate climates (105). Sometimes, soil tests for nitrate in the top 15 or 30 cm of soils have not
been well correlated with crop yields because of depletion of nitrate in these zones by leaching in
humid regions (113). Good correlations between soil nitrate tests and crop yields have been noted
with  soil  samples  taken  from  120-  to  180-cm  depth  in  the  proﬁle.  Roth  and  Fox  (125)  reported
nitrate concentrations that ranged from 36 to 295 kg N/ha in the 120-cm proﬁle following the har-
vest of corn. Soils fertilized with nitrogen applied at economiclly optimum amounts had nitrate con-
centrations ranging from 41 to 138 kg N/ha. Soils with more than 169 kg nitrate-N/ha in the 120-cm
proﬁle  did  not  show  an  increase  in  corn  yields  in  response  to  nitrogen  fertilization.  Jokela  and
Randall (124) reported that nitrate concentrations in a 150-cm proﬁle ranged from 150 to 500 kg
N/ha over a range of fertilizer treatments after corn harvest in the fall but fell by 50 to 70% by the
following spring.

Nitrate concentrations vary among soils and among seasons of the year for a given soil and cli-
mate (105,127). In humid temperate climatic areas, nitrate in soils is low in the cold of winter, rises
in spring and through the summer with warming of soils and falls in the fall with the rains. In unfer-
tilized ﬁelds in the winter, nitrate in topsoil (top 30 to 60 cm) is less than 5 or 10 mg N/kg (105).
The concentration can rise to 40 to 60 mg nitrate-N/kg in spring and summer. Depending on the per-
meability of soil, the depletion of nitrate from topsoil can be rapid with fall rains. Tillage of land
can bring about an increase of nitrate, as mineralization and nitriﬁcation are increased by aeration
of the soil due to tillage. Generally, the more intensive the tillage, the greater the nitrate concentra-
tions in the soil (128–130). For example, in the 120-cm-deep soil proﬁle, following a crop of corn,
the nitrate in conventionally tilled soils (100 to 120 kg N/ha) was twice that in the proﬁle of soils
cropped in a no-tillage system (129). In dry seasons, soil nitrate can be very low due to low micro-
biological activity, perhaps less than 10 mg N/kg, but increases as rain falls and mineralization and
nitriﬁcation result in the wetted soil. In some cases, if the subsoil contains nitrate, nitrate may rise
with capillary action and accumulate in dry surface soils. Absorption by plants is a principal path
of removal of nitrate from soils. Removal is unique with various soils and crops (105). Perennial
crops having a developed root system can absorb nitrate as soon as conditions are favorable for
plant  growth.  Grassland  soils  generally  are  low  in  nitrate  throughout  the  year.  However, annual
crops do not absorb much nitrate from soils until the root systems are developed.

Many soil test recommendations for correlation of soil nitrate with crop yields require soil sam-
pling to a minimum depth of 60 cm (113). Sampling to this depth involves considerable costs, and
attempts have been made to develop a test based on shallower sampling. Alvarez et al. (131) devel-
oped prediction equations that related nitrate in the top 30 cm stratum to that in the top 60 cm stra-
tum. Recent research has shown good correlations between crop yields and concentrations of nitrate
in  the  surface  30 cm  layer  of  soils  early  in  the  growing  season  (132–135).  Determination  of  the
amount of nitrate in the upper stratum of soil early in the season has led to the development of a test
called the early season nitrate test or pre-sidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT).

The basis of the PSNT is the concentration of nitrate in the surface 30 cm of soils at the time
that a crop starts rapid growth, for example, when corn is 30 cm tall (133,134). The amount of
nitrate in the soil at this depth at this time is an assessment of the amount of nitrogen available for

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 38

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

crop growth for the remainder of the season and of the need for nitrogen fertilization. The criti-
cal concentration  of  soil  nitrate  for  the  PSNT  is  the  concentration  above  which  yields  are  not
expected to increase with additional nitrogen fertilization. For corn production, Sims et al. (135)
in Delaware reported that the PSNT test identiﬁed nitrogen-deﬁcient or nitrogen-suﬃcient sites
with about 70% success. Binford et al. (132) in Iowa determined that the critical concentration of
nitrate for corn was 23 to 26 mg N/kg   f o r   a   3 0 cm depth. Sampling 60 cm deep improved cor-
relations between corn grain yields and soil nitrate, but it was felt that the improvement did not
justify the additional costs of deep sampling. The critical concentration for the 60 cm depth was
16 to 19 mg N/kg soil. Other research has given similar results. Meisinger et al. (136) in Maryland
determined a critical nitrate concentration of 22 mg N/kg with the PSNT successfully identifying
nitrogen-suﬃcient sites across a range of textures, drainage classes, and years. Including ammo-
nium in the analysis slightly improved the predictive use of the test (136). Heckman et al. (137) in
New Jersey reported a critical nitrate concentration at the 30 cm depth to be 22 mg N/kg for corn.
Evanylo and Alley (138) in Virginia reported critical nitrate concentrations of 18 mg N/kg for corn
and noted that the PSNT was applicable to soils without regard to texture or physiographic region.
Also for corn, Sainz-Rozas et al. (139) in Argentina reported a critical nitrate concentration of 17
to 27 mg N/kg at the 30 cm depth. They also reported that there was no improvement in reliability
if the test was done on samples to 60 cm depth or with the inclusion of ammonium in the deter-
minations. Critical concentrations, similar in magnitude to those for corn have been reported for
sweet corn (Zea mays rugosa Bonaf.) (140), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), celery (Apium graveolens
dulce Pers.)  (141), cabbage  (Brassica  oleracea  capitata L.)  (142), and  tomato  (Lycopersicon 
esculentum Mill.) (143).

If the concentration of nitrate is below the critical concentration, fertilization of the crops is
necessary.  However, the  need  to  collect  soil  samples  during  the  growing  season  has  limited  the
usage  of  the  PSNT.  Fertilization  is  delayed  until  the  results  of  the  PSNT  are  obtained, and  bad
weather can delay applications of nitrogen.

2.5.2.1.3 Amino Sugars
Fractionation of soil hydrolysates has been used to determine a labile pool of organic nitrogen in
soil and to relate this fraction to crop responses to nitrogen fertilizers (102,144). The results of most
of these studies have shown little variation among soil types or cultivation patterns in the partition-
ing  of  hydrolyzable  soil  nitrogen  into  various  nitrogenous  components  and  the  capacity  of  soil
organic matter to form nitrate. The uniformity among soils was attributed in part to errors in analy-
sis (145,146). Mulvaney and Khan (147) developed a diﬀusion method for accurately determining
amino sugar nitrogen in soil hydrolysates. Mulvaney et al. (145) noted that hydrolysates (6 M HCl)
of  soils  in  which  crops  were  nonresponsive  to  nitrogen  fertilization  had  higher  concentrations
of amino  sugars  (e.g., glucosamine, galactosamine, mannosamine, muramic  acid)  than  did
hydrolysates of soils in which crops responded to nitrogen fertilization. They reported no consistent
diﬀerences among the total nitrogen, the ammonium nitrogen, or the amino acid nitrogen fraction
of the soil hydrolysate. The amounts of amino sugars were related to mineralization of soil organic
nitrogen, since production of inorganic nitrogen upon aerobic incubation of the nonresponsive soils
was much greater than that in the responsive soils (145). Concentrations of amino sugars were cor-
related with response to fertilizer nitrogen applied. Mulvaney et al. (145) classiﬁed soils with more
than 250 mg amino sugar nitrogen per kg as being nonresponsive and those with less than 200 mg
amino sugar nitrogen per kg as being responsive to nitrogen fertilization. Khan et al. (146) devel-
oped a simpler test for determining amino sugar nitrogen than the processes involving soil hydrol-
ysis. The simpler test involved soil being treated with base (2 M NaOH), followed by heating (50⬚C)
to release ammonia, and then determining the amount of ammonia releases by volumetric methods.
This method determined ammonium and amino sugar nitrogen without liberating substantial nitro-
gen from amino acids and none from nitrate or nitrite. Test values for soils nonresponsive to nitro-
gen fertilization were 237 to 435 mg N/kg and for responsive soils were 72 to 223 mg N/kg soil.

Amino sugars may constitute 5 or 6% of the humic substances in soils (148). Variations in kind and
amount of amino sugars have been noted with climate and with cultivation of soils (149,150).

2.6 NITROGEN FERTILIZERS
Soils have little capacity to retain oxidized forms of nitrogen, and ammonium accumulation in soils is
small; consequently, most of the soil nitrogen is associated with organic matter. Release of nitrogen
from organic matter is slow and unpredictable. If soil organic matter is depleted, as occurs in cultivated
soils, nitrogen for plant growth is limited. Nitrogen is usually the most deﬁcient nutrient in cultivated
soils of the world, and fertilization of these soils with nitrogen is required. To maintain or increase pro-
ductivity  of  soils, worldwide  consumption  of  nitrogen  fertilizers  continues  to  increase  with  time
(Figure 2.3). However, the consumption of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers has leveled.

Anhydrous ammonia (NH3 gas) is the starting product for manufacture of most nitrogen fertil-
izers. Anhydrous ammonia is manufactured from hydrogen and nitrogen gases by the Haber process
(Haber–Bosch  process). The  reaction  is  performed  at  high  temperature  (400  to  500⬚C)  and  high
pressure (300 to 1000 atm) in the presence of a catalyst (iron or other metal) (151–153). The nitro-
gen  gas  is  obtained  from  the  air, which  is  about  79%  nitrogen  by  volume, and  the  hydrogen  is
obtained from natural gas (methane), oil, coal, water, or other sources.

Jones (152) and Moldovan et al. (154) describe the production of other nitrogen fertilizers from
ammonia. A  brief  summary  of  these  processes  follows.  Nitric  acid, produced  from  ammonia, is
another basic material in the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizers. To produce nitric acid, compressed
ammonia and air are heated in the presence of a catalyst and steam. The nitric acid can be reacted
with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. Sodium nitrate is the product of the reaction of nitric
acid  with  sodium  bicarbonate.  Sodium  nitrate  also  is  produced  from  caliche  (Chilean  saltpeter),
which is a mineral that contains sodium nitrate and various salts of sodium, calcium, potassium, and
magnesium.  Sodium  nitrate, sometimes  called  Chilean  nitrate, is  one  of  the  earliest  commercial
nitrogen  fertilizers  marketed.  Until  1929, all  of  the  sodium  nitrate  marketed  was  extracted  from
Chilean saltpeter (154). Urea is manufactured chieﬂy by combining ammonia with carbon dioxide
under high pressure. Ammonium sulfate is manufactured by the reaction of ammonia with sulfuric
acid, gypsum, or sulfur dioxide.

The  merits  of  nitrate  and  ammonium  fertilizers  have  been  researched  and  reviewed  extensively
(155–166). Many manufactured fertilizers and most organic fertilizers are ammonical; however, the
ammonium that is inherent in the fertilizer or that is released upon contact with soils is soon oxidized
to  nitrate, unless  nitriﬁcation  is  inhibited  (167–171).  Nitriﬁcation  inhibitors  may  be  employed  with
ammoniacal fertilizers to restrict losses of nitrogen from soils by leaching or denitriﬁcation.

2.6.1 PROPERTIES AND USE OF NITROGEN FERTILIZERS
The nitrogen concentrations of the following fertilizers have been rounded to values of commonly
marketed grades.

2.6.1.1 Anhydrous Ammonia (82% N)

Anhydrous ammonia is the most-used nitrogen-containing fertilizer for direct application to land in
the United States (152). Worldwide, consumption of anhydrous ammonia is ranked fourth or ﬁfth
among nitrogen fertilizers (Table 2.7). In agriculture, anhydrous gaseous ammonia is compressed
into a liquid and is applied under high pressure with a special implement by injection at least 15 cm
deep into a moist soil. The ammonia gas reacts with water to form ammonium ions, which can be
held to clay or organic matter. If the ammonia is not injected deeply enough or soil is too wet or dry,
ammonia can be lost by volatilization. Anhydrous ammonia is usually the cheapest source of nitro-
gen, but equipment and power requirements of the methods of application are speciﬁc and high.

2.6.1.2 Aqua Ammonia (21% N)

Aqua ammonia is ammonia dissolved in water under low pressure. Aqua ammonia must be incor-
porated into land to avoid losses of nitrogen by ammonia volatilization; however, it needs not be
incorporated as deeply as anhydrous ammonia.

2.6.1.3 Urea (46% N)

Urea is the most widely used dry nitrogen fertilizer in the world (Table 2.7). After application to soils,
urea is converted into ammonia, which can be held in the soil or converted into nitrate. Ammonia
volatilization following fertilization with urea can be substantial, and if urea is applied to the surface

of the land, considerable loss of nitrogen can occur (172,173). Hydrolysis of urea by urease produces
ammonium carbonate. With surface-applied urea, alkalinity of pH 9 or higher can develop under the
urea granule or pellet, and ammonia will volatilize into the air. Volatilization occurs on bare ground,
on debris, or on plant leaves. Urea is readily soluble in water, and rainfall or irrigation after its appli-
cation move it into the soil and lessens volatilization losses. Use of urease inhibitors has been sug-
gested to lessen the volatilization losses of ammonia from surface-applied urea (174). Manufactured
urea is identical to urea in animal urine.

Calcium  nitrate  urea  (calurea, 34%  N, 10%  Ca)  is  a  double-compound  fertilizer  of  calcium

nitrate and urea to supply calcium and nitrogen (152).

Several derivatives of urea are marketed as slow-release fertilizers (175,176). Urea formaldehyde
(ureaform, 38% N) is a slow-release fertilizer manufactured from urea and formaldehyde and is used
for fertilization of lawns, turf, container-grown plants, and ﬁeld crops (177–180). Urea formaldehyde
is also a glue and is used for the manufacture of plywood and particle board (181,182). Dicyandiamide
(cyanoguanidine) (66% N) is a nitrogen fertilizer but is used most commonly as an additive (2% of
the total N fertilizer) as a nitriﬁcation inhibitor with urea (153,183–185). Sulfur-coated urea (186,187)
is a slow-release formulation (30–40% N) used as a fertilizer for ﬁeld crops, orchards, and turfgrass
(175,177,188–191).

Isobutylidene diurea (IBDU) is similar to urea formaldehyde, but contains 32% nitrogen. However,
utilization of IBDU is less dependent on microbial activity than urea formaldehyde, as hydrolysis pro-
ceeds rapidly following dissolution of IBDU in water (175). Nitrogen is released when soil moisture is
adequate. IBDU is used most widely as a lawn fertilizer (176,192). Its ﬁeld use is to restrict leaching of
nitrogen (181).

Methylene ureas are a class of sparingly soluble products, which were developed during the
1960s and 1970s. These products contain predominantly intermediate chain-length polymers. The
total nitrogen content of these polymers is 39 to 40%, with between 25 and 60% of the nitrogen
present as cold-water-insoluble nitrogen. This fertilizer is used primarily in fertilization of turfgrass,
although it has been used with other crops on sandy soils or where leaching of nitrate is an envi-
ronmental concern (176,191,193).

2.6.1.4 Ammonium Nitrate (34% N)

Ammonium nitrate is a dry material sold in granular or prilled form. It can be broadcasted or side-
dressed to crops and can be left on the surface or incorporated. It does not give an alkaline reaction
with soils; hence, it does not volatilize readily. However, incorporation is recommended with cal-
careous soils. Ammonium nitrate is decreasing in popularity because of storage problems, e.g., with
ﬁre and explosion.

Calcium ammonium nitrate (ammonium nitrate limestone, about 20% N and 6% Ca) is a mix-
ture of ammonium nitrate and limestone. This fertilizer is not acid-forming and is used to supply
nitrogen and calcium to crops (152).

2.6.1.5 Ammonium Sulfate (21% N)

Ammonium sulfate is marketed as a dry crystalline material. It is recommended for use on alkaline soils
where  it  may  be  desirable  to  lower  soil  pH.  Nitriﬁcation  of  ammonium  is  an  acidifying  process.
Ammonium sulfate can be broadcasted or sidedressed. It can left on surfaces or incorporated, although
on calcareous soils watering in or incorporating is recommended to avoid ammonia volatilization (176).

2.6.1.6 Nitrogen Solutions (28–32% N)

These fertilizers are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and urea dissolved in water. In the solutions,
half of the nitrogen is supplied as urea, and half is supplied as ammonium nitrate. Because of the
diﬃculties in handling, urea and ammonium nitrate should not be mixed together in dry form. The

CRC_DK2972_Ch002.qxd  7/5/2006  8:53 AM  Page 42

solution acts once the dry materials are applied to the soil. Ammonia volatilization may be sub-
stantial during warm weather, especially with surface application. The solutions should be watered
into the soil and should not be applied to foliage.

2.6.1.7 Ammonium Phosphates (10–21% N)

Ammonium  phosphates  are  important  phosphorus-containing  fertilizers  because  of  their  high  con-
centrations  of  phosphorus  and  water  solubility.  Diammonium  phosphate  (commonly  18%  N, 46%
P2O5) is a dry granular or crystalline material. It is a soil-acidifying fertilizer and is useful on calcare-
ous soils. It should be incorporated into the soil. It is a common starter fertilizer and is a common com-
ponent of greenhouse and household fertilizers. Monoammonium phosphate (commonly 11% N, 48%
P2O5) has uses similar to those of diammonium phosphate. Ammonium polyphosphate (10% N, 34%
P2O5) is marketed as a solution. Its use is similar to that of monoammonium phosphate and diammo-
nium phosphate. Ammonium phosphates are made by reaction of ammonia with orthophosphoric acid
(mono- and diammonium salts) or with superphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid (152).

2.6.1.8 Other Inorganic Nitrogen Fertilizers

Many other nitrogen-containing fertilizers include double-salt mixtures such as ammonium nitrate
sulfate (30% N), ammonium phosphate nitrate (25% N), urea ammonium phosphate (25–34% N),
nitric phosphate, and ammoniated superphosphate (8% N) (152). These materials are used in the
manufacture of mixed N-P-K fertilizers or for special needs in soil fertility.

2.6.1.9 Organic Nitrogen Fertilizers (0.2–15% N)

Although  naturally  occurring, sodium  nitrate  may  not  be  recognized  as  an  organic  fertilizer.
Most  organic  fertilizers  are  derived  from  plant  and  animal  sources  and  are  proteinaceous

materials. The fertilizer industry started with meat and other food processors, who wanted to
dispose  of  and  ﬁnd  a  use  for  wastes  and  by-products  (152,194). Around  1900, about  90%  of
nitrogen fertilizer was derived from proteinaceous wastes and by-products, but today usage has
declined to less than 1%. Organic materials range from less than 1 to about 15% N compared
with the chemical sources described above, which range upward to over 80% N. Costs of han-
dling, shipping, and  spreading  of  the  bulky, low-analysis  organic  materials  have  led  to  their
decline  in  usage  with  time. Also, many  of  the  proteinaceous  by-products  of  food  processing
have higher value as feeds for poultry and livestock than as fertilizers (194,152). Nevertheless,
demand for organic fertilizers remains, as organic farmers require these products in the mainte-
nance of soil fertility on their cropland (195).

The  value  of  organic  nitrogen  fertilizers  depends  on  their  rate  of  mineralization, which 
is  closely  related  to  their  nitrogen  concentration  (152,195,196).  Generally, the  more  nitrogen 
in the fertilizer, the faster the rate of mineralization. Some common organic fertilizers are listed in
Table 2.8.

3.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

3.1.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION
Incidental  phosphorus  fertilization  in  the  form  of  manures, plant  and  animal  biomass, and  other
natural  materials, such  as  bones, probably  has  been  practiced  since  agriculture  began. Although
speciﬁc nutritional beneﬁts were unknown, Arthur Young in the Annuals of Agriculture in the mid-
nineteenth  century  describes  experiments  evaluating  a  wide  range  of  products  including  poultry
dung, gunpowder, charcoal, ashes, and various salts. The results showed positive crop responses to
certain  materials.  Beneﬁting  from  recent  developments  in  chemistry  by  Antoine  Lavoisier
(1743–1794) and others, Theodore de Saussure (1767–1845) was perhaps the  ﬁrst to advance the
concept that plants absorb speciﬁc mineral elements from the soil.

The science of plant nutrition advanced considerably in the nineteenth century owing to contri-
butions by Carl Sprengel (1787–1859), A.F. Wiegmann (1771–1853), Jean-Baptiste Boussingault
(1802–1887), and Justus von Liebig (1803–1873). Based on the ubiquitous presence of phosphorus
in soil and plant materials, and crop responses to phosphorus-containing products, it became appar-
ent that phosphorus was essential for plant growth.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Liebig observed that dissolving bones in sulfuric acid enhanced phosphorus availability to plants.
Familiar with Liebig’s work, John Lawes in collaboration with others, evaluated several apatite-con-
taining products as phosphorus nutritional sources for plants. Lawes performed these experiments in
what  ultimately  became  the  world’s  most  famous  agricultural  experiment  station—his  estate  in
Rothamsted. The limited supply of bones prompted developments in the utilization of rock phosphates
where  Lawes  obtained  the  ﬁrst  patent  concerning  the  utilization  of  acid-treated  rock  phosphate  in
1842, The ﬁrst commercial production of rock phosphate began in Suﬀolk, England, in 1847. Mining
phosphate in the United States began in 1867. Thus began the phosphorus fertilizer industry.

Crop responses to phosphorus fertilization were widespread. For many years phosphorus fertil-
ization practices were based on grower experience often augmented with empirical data from exper-
iment  station  ﬁeld  tests. Although  researchers  and  growers  realized  that  customized  phosphorus
fertilizer recommendations would be invaluable, early work often focused on total element content
of soils and produced disappointing results. The productivity of soil essentially showed no correla-
tion to total content of nutrients in them.

It was during the twentieth century that the recognition that the plant itself was an excellent
indicator of nutrient deﬁciency coupled with considerable advances in analytical methodology gave
way to signiﬁcant advances in the use of tissue testing. Hall (1) proposed plant analysis as a means
of determining the normal nutrient contents of plants. Macy (2) proposed the basic theory that there
was a critical concentration of nutrient in a plant above which there was luxury consumption and
below which there was poverty adjustment, which was proportional to the deﬁciency until a mini-
mum percentage was reached.

Also during the twentieth century, a greater understanding of soil chemistry of phosphorus and
the observation that dilute acids seem to correlate to plant-available phosphorus in the soil gave way
to the development of successful soil-testing methodologies. The early contributions of Dyer (3),
Truog (4), Morgon (5), and Bray and Kutrz (6) are noteworthy. Plant tissue testing and soil testing
for phosphorus are discussed in greater detail in the subsequent sections. For more detailed history
on plant nutrition and soil–plant relationships, readers are referred to Kitchen (7) and Russell (8).

3.1.2 PHOSPHORUS FUNCTIONS IN PLANTS
Phosphorus is utilized in the fully oxidized and hydrated form as orthophosphate. Plants typically
2⫺, depending on the pH of the growing medium. However, under
absorb either H2PO4
certain conditions plants might absorb soluble organic phosphates, including nucleic acids. A por-
tion of absorbed inorganic phosphorus is quickly combined into organic molecules upon entry into
the roots or after it is transported into the shoot.

⫺ or HPO4

Phosphate  is  a  trivalent  resonating  tetraoxyanion  that  serves  as  a  linkage  or  binding  site  and  is
generally  resistant  to  polarization  and  nucleophilic  attack  except  in  metal-enzyme  complexes  (9).
Orthophosphate can be condensed to form oxygen-linked polyphosphates. These unique properties of
phosphate produce water-stable anhydrides and esters that are important in energy storage and transfer
in plant biochemical processes. Most notable are adenosine diphosphate and triphosphate (ADP and
ATP). Energy is released when a terminal phosphate is split from ADP or ATP. The transfer of phos-
phate  molecules  to  ATP  from  energy-transforming  processes  and  from  ATP  to  energy-requiring
processes in the plants is known as phosphorylation. A portion of the energy derived from photosyn-
thesis is conserved by phosphorylation of ADP to yield ATP in a process called photophosphorylation.
Energy released during respiration is similarly harnessed in a process called oxidative phosphorylation.
Beyond their role in energy-transferring processes, phosphate bonds serve as important linkage
groups. Phosphate is a structural component of phospholipids, nucleic acids, nucleotides, coenzymes,
and phosphoproteins. Phospholipids are important in membrane structure. Nucleic acids of genes and
chromosomes carry genetic material from cell to cell. As a monoester, phosphorus provides an essen-
tial ligand in enzymatic catalysis. Phytic acid, the hexaphosphate ester of myo-inositol phosphate, is
the most common phosphorus reserve in seeds. Inorganic and organic phosphates in plants also serve
as buﬀers in the maintenance of cellular pH.

Phosphorus

Total phosphorus in plant tissue ranges from about 0.1 to 1%. Bieleski (10) suggests that a typ-
ical  plant  might  contain  approximately  0.004%  P  as  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA), 0.04%  P  as
ribonucleic acid (RNA), 0.03% as lipid P, 0.02 % as ester P, and 0.13% as inorganic P.

3.1.3 NATURE AND TRANSFORMATIONS OF SOIL PHOSPHORUS
Soils contain organic and inorganic phosphorus compounds. Because organic compounds are largely
derived  from  plant  residues, microbial  cells, and  metabolic  products, components  of  soil  organic
matter are often similar to these source materials. Approximately 1% of the organic phosphorus is in
the phospholipid fraction; 5 to 10% is in nucleic acids or degradation products, and up to 60% is in
an  inositol  polyphosphate  fraction  (11).  A  signiﬁcant  portion  of  the  soil  organic  fraction  is
unidentiﬁed.

Phospholipids and nucleic acids that enter the soil are degraded rapidly by soil microorganisms
(12,13). The more stable, and therefore more abundant, constituents of the organic phosphorus frac-
tion are the inositol phosphates. Inositol polyphosphates are usually associated with high-molecu-
lar-weight molecules extracted from the soil, suggesting that they are an important component of
humus (14,15).

Soils  normally  contain  a  wide  range  of  microorganisms  capable  of  releasing  inorganic
orthophosphate  from  organic  phosphates  of  plant  and  microbial  origin  (16,17).  Conditions  that
favor the activities of these organisms, such as warm temperatures and near-neutral pH values also
favor mineralization of organic phosphorus in soils (16,18). The enzymes involved in the cleavage
of phosphate from organic substrates are collectively called phosphatases. Microorganisms produce
a variety of phosphatases that mineralize organic phosphate (19).

Phosphorus released to the soil solution from the mineralization of organic matter might be taken
up by the microbial population, taken up by growing plants, transferred to the soil inorganic pool, or
less likely lost by leaching and runoﬀ (Figure 3.1). Phosphorus, like nitrogen, undergoes mineraliza-
tion and immobilization. The net phosphorus release depends on the phosphorus concentration of the
residues undergoing decay and the phosphorus requirements of the active microbial population (16).
In addition to phosphorus mineralization and immobilization, it appears that organic matter has
indirect, but  sometimes  inconsistent, eﬀects  on  soil  phosphorus  reactions.  Lopez-Hernandez  and
Burnham (20) reported a positive correlation between humiﬁcation and phosphate-sorption capacity.
Wild  (21)  concluded  that  the  phosphorus-sorption  capacity  of  organic  matter  is  negligible.  It  is
observed more commonly that organic matter hinders phosphorus sorption, thereby enhancing avail-
ability. Humic acids and other organic acids often reduce phosphorus ﬁxation through the formation
of complexes (chelates) with Fe, Al, Ca, and other cations that react with phosphorus (22–24). Studies
have shown that organic phosphorus is much more mobile in soils than inorganic sources (25). The

interaction between the organic and inorganic phosphorus fractions is understood poorly. It is gener-
ally presumed that phosphorus availability to plants is controlled by the inorganic phosphorus fraction,
although the contribution of organic phosphorus to plant nutrition should not be dismissed.

Inorganic phosphorus entering the soil solution, by mineralization or fertilizer additions, is rapidly
converted into less available forms. Sorption and precipitation reactions are involved. The sorption of
inorganic  phosphorus  from  solution  is  closely  related  to  the  presence  of  amorphous  iron  and  alu-
minum oxides and hydrous oxides (26–30) and the amounts of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (24,31,32).
Hydrous oxides and oxides of aluminum and iron often occur as coatings on clay mineral sur-
faces (27,28,33), and these coatings may account for a large portion of the phosphorus sorption
associated  with  the  clay  fraction  of  soils.  Even  in  calcareous  soils, hydrous  oxides  have  been
demonstrated as being important in phosphorus sorption, as was demonstrated by Shukla (34) for
calcareous lake sediments, Holford and Mattingly (24) for calcareous mineral soils, and Porter and
Sanchez (35) for calcareous Histosols.

In calcareous soils, phosphorus (or phosphate) sorption to CaCO3 may be of equal or greater
importance than sorption to aluminum and iron oxides (35). In a laboratory investigation with pure
calcite, Cole (31) concluded that the reaction of phosphorus with CaCO3 consisted of initial sorp-
tion reactions followed by precipitation with increasing concentrations of phosphorus. Phosphorus
sorption  may  occur  in  part  as  a  multilayer  phenomenon  on  speciﬁc  sites  of  the  calcite  surface
(24,32). As  sorption  proceeds, lateral  interactions  occur  between  sorbed  phosphorus, eventually
resulting in clusters. These clusters in turn serve as centers for the heterogeneous nucleation of cal-
cium phosphate crystallites on the calcite surface.

Phosphorus sorption is probably limited to relatively low initial phosphorus solution concen-
trations and precipitation is likely a more important mechanism of phosphorus removal from the
soil solutions at higher concentrations (31). Lindsay (36) identiﬁed, by x-ray crystallography, what
he considered to be an incomplete list of 32 forms of phosphate compounds as reaction products
from phosphorus fertilizers. The nature of the reaction products formed when phosphorus fertilizer
is added to soil depends primarily on the coexisting cation, the pH of the saturated solution, the
quantity of phosphorus fertilizer added, and the chemical characteristics of the soil (37). In acidic
soils, aluminum and iron will generally precipitate phosphorus. In calcareous soils, an acidic fertil-
izer solution would dissolve calcium, and it is anticipated that most of the added phosphorus fertil-
izer would precipitate initially as dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and dicalcium phosphate
(DCP) (38,39). These products are only moderately stable and undergo a slow conversion into com-
pounds such as octacalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, or one of the apatites.

As  discussed  above, soil  transformations  of  phosphorus  are  complex  and  often  ambiguous.
Phosphorus availability has often been characterized in general terms (a) as solution phosphorus, often
known as the intensity factor, (b) as readily available or labile phosphorus, often known as the quan-
tity  factor, and  (c)  as  nonlabile  phosphorus. The  labile  fraction  might  include  easily  mineralizable
organic phosphorus, low-energy sorbed phosphorus, and soluble mineral phosphorus. The nonlabile
fraction might include resistant organic phosphorus, high-energy sorbed phosphorus, and relatively
insoluble phosphate minerals. As plants take up phosphorus from the solution, it is replenished from
the labile fraction, which in turn is more slowly replenished by the nonlabile fraction. The soil buﬀer
capacity, known as the capacity factor, governs the distribution of phosphorus among these pools. As
will be shown in a subsequent section, although some soil tests aim to characterize only the intensity
factor, most aim to characterize quantity and capacity factors as indices of phosphorus availability.

3.2 DIAGNOSING PHOSPHORUS DEFICIENCY

3.2.1 VISUAL SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY AND EXCESS
Phosphorus deﬁciency suppresses or delays growth and maturity. Although phosphorus- deﬁcient
plants are generally stunted in appearance, they seldom exhibit the conspicuous foliar symptoms

CRC_DK2972_Ch003.qxd  6/30/2006  1:15 PM  Page 55

characteristic  of  some  of  the  other  nutrient  deﬁciencies.  Furthermore, appreciable  overlap  often
occurs with the symptoms of other nutrient deﬁciencies. Plant stems or leaves are sometimes dark
green, often developing red and purple colors. However, when weather is cool purpling of leaves
can also be associated with nitrogen deﬁciency, as is often observed in Brassica species, or with
phosphorus deﬁciency. Plants stunted by phosphorus deﬁciency often have small, dark-green leaves
and short and slender stems. Sustained phosphorus deﬁciency will probably produce smaller-sized
fruit and limited harvestable vegetable mass. Because phosphorus is mobile in plants, it is translo-
cated readily from old to young leaves as deﬁciency occurs, and chlorosis and necrosis on older
leaves is sometimes observed. Readers are referred to tables of phosphorus deﬁciency symptoms
speciﬁc to individual crops and compiled by other authors (40–43).

Most soils readily buﬀer phosphorus additions, and phosphorus is seldom present in the soil
solution  at  levels  that  cause  direct  toxicity.  Perhaps  the  most  common  symptoms  of  phosphorus
excess are phosphate-induced micronutrient deﬁciencies, particularly Zn or Cu deﬁciencies (43,44).

3.2.2 TISSUE TESTING FOR PHOSPHORUS
As noted previously, visual indications of phosphorus deﬁciency are seldom conclusive; consequently,
accurate diagnosis typically requires a tissue test. Most diagnostic standards are generated using the
theory  of  Macy  (2), as  noted  previously  concerning  critical  levels, suﬃciency  ranges, and  poverty
adjustment. In practice, critical levels or suﬃciency ranges are usually determined by plotting ﬁnal rel-
ative yield against phosphorus concentration in plant tissues and interpreting the resulting curvilinear
function at some speciﬁed level of maximum yield. For many agronomic crops, values of 90 to 95%
maximum yield are frequently used. However, for vegetable crops, which have a higher market value
and  an  economic  optimum  closer  to  maximum  yield, values  of  98%  have  been  used  (Figure  3.2).
Sometimes  researchers  use  discontinuous  functions  such  as  the  “linear  response  and  plateau” or
“quadratic  response  and  plateau” and  deﬁne  adequacy  by  the  plateau  line  (Figure  3.3). Yet, other
researchers have suggested that the correlation to ﬁnal yield is less than ideal and have proposed the
use of incremental growth-rate analysis in developing critical concentrations (45).

FIGURE 3.4 Calculated critical acetic acid extractable phosphate-P concentrations at four growth stages for
lettuce. (Gardner and Sanchez, unpublished data.)

Levels  of  deﬁciency, suﬃciency, and  excess  have  been  determined  in  solution  culture  and  in
greenhouse and ﬁeld experiments. Total phosphorus content of a selected plant part at a certain growth
stage is used for most crops. However, many standards developed for vegetable crops are based on a
2% acetic acid extraction (Figure 3.4). Diagnostic standards for various plant species are summarized
in Table 3.1. This compilation includes data from other compilations and from research studies. When
data from other compilations were used, priority was given to research that cited original source of
data (46–48) so that potential users can scrutinize how the values were determined. However, when

no  other  values  were  available, some  values  were  drawn  from  sources  that  did  not  cite  original
research (49). Generally, crops require a preplant application of phosphorus fertilizer in the case of
annual crops or before the fruiting cycle begins in the case of perennial crops. Diagnosis of a phos-
phorus deﬁciency by tissue analysis for annual crops is often postmortem for the existing crop.

3.2.3 SOIL TESTING FOR PHOSPHORUS
As noted in a previous section, crop response to phosphorus is correlated poorly to the total amount
of phosphorus in a soil. Therefore, a successful soil test should represent some index of phospho-
rus availability. The development of a soil test requires selection of an extractant, development of
studies that correlate the amount of nutrient extracted with phosphorus accumulation by crops, and
calibration studies that determine a relationship between soil test results and amount of fertilizer
required for optimal production.

Over  the  past  century, a  number  of  soil-testing  procedures  have  been  proposed, and  several

excellent reviews on soil testing for phosphorus have been published (50–53).

This chapter focuses on historical developments, mode of action, and generalized interpreta-

tions of the major phosphorus soil tests utilized in the United States.

The major soil tests that have been used or proposed in the United States are summarized in Table
3.2. Most early soil tests were developed empirically and were based on simple correlations between
extractant and some measure of crop response to fertilization with phosphorus. However, based on the
phosphorus-fractionation method developed by Chang and Jackson (54), inferences have been made
concerning the mode of action, or the forms of phosphorus extracted by various solutions. The inferred
modes of action for various chemical extractant components are presented in Table 3.3. Generally,
water  or  dilute  salt  solutions  characterize  phosphorus  in  the  soil  solution  or  the  intensity  factor,
whereas acids, complexing solutions, or alkaline buﬀer solutions generally characterize the quantity
factor. Tests based on water extraction often correlate well with phosphorus accumulation in shallow-
rooted, fast- growing vegetable crops. However, soil tests capable of better characterizing the labile
fraction and capacity factor generally produce more reliable results for ﬁeld and orchard crops.

An early soil test for phosphorus aimed at characterizing available phosphorus was the 1% cit-
ric acid test developed by Dyer (3). This test was adapted in England but was not used widely in the

United States. A dilute acid test proposed by Truog (4) and a test based on a universal soil extract-
ing solution proposed by Morgan (5) were among the earliest soil tests used in the United States.

The test based on the Bray-I extractant was perhaps the ﬁrst to be implemented widely in soil-test-
ing laboratories in the United States, and it is still extensively used in the midwestern United States.
This mild-acid solution has been shown reliably to predict crop response to phosphorus fertilization
on neutral to acidic soils. However, the test is much less eﬀective in basic soils, where the acid is neu-
tralized quickly by the soil bases present and ﬂuoride ions are precipitated by calcium (55).

In the southeastern United States, the Mehlich 1 (M-I) soil-test extractant is used commonly for
simultaneous extraction of P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Mn, Fe, and Zn. The M-I soil test does not correlate
with  crop  response  on  calcareous  soils  probably  for  the  same  reasons  the  Bray-I  test  does  not.
Consequently, the Mehlich 2 (M-II) test was introduced as an extractant that would allow simulta-
neous determinations of the same nutrients over a wide range of soil properties. However, the cor-
rosive  properties  of  the  M-II  in  instruments  discouraged  wide  acceptance  of  this  extractant  and
prompted  modiﬁcations  that  ultimately  became  the  Mehlich  3  (M-III)  extraction. The  M-III  has
been shown to be reliable across a wide range of soil–crop production circumstances (56,57).

The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (58) soil test for phosphorus generally correlates well with
crop response on calcareous soils in the western United States. The NH4HCO3-DPTA (diethylene-
triaminepentaacetic acid) soil test also has been used for the simultaneous determination of P, K,
Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn (59,60) and performs similar to the NaHCO3 test with respect to phosphorus.
Another  test  that  shows  good  correlations  on  calcareous  soils  is  the  EDTA  (ethylenediaminete-
traacetic acid) soil test (61).

Isotopic dilution techniques (53) and phosphorus sorption isotherms (62) have been used not
only to characterize the labile phosphorus fraction but also the phosphorus-buﬀering capacity of
soils. However, these approaches are too tedious and costly to be used as routine soil tests.

Ultimately, soil-test phosphorus levels must be converted into phosphorus fertilizer recommen-
dations for crops. A useful starting point is the determination of critical soil-test levels, that is the
soil-test phosphorus level above which there is no response to phosphorus fertilizer. An example of
a  critical  phosphorus  soil-test  level  based  on  water  extraction  for  celery  is  shown  in  Figure  3.5.
Using the double calibration approach described by Thomas and Peaslee (50) information on how
much fertilizer is required to achieve the critical concentration would result in a fertilizer recom-
mendation. This approach is used for Histosols by the Soil Testing Laboratory at the University of
Florida. An example of resulting fertilizer recommendations for several commodities is shown in
Figure 3.6.

The laboratory mentioned above makes recommendations for Histosols over a limited geographi-
cal location. However, most soil-testing laboratories make recommendations over large geographical
area and across more diverse soil types. Under most situations, quantitative information on how phos-
phorus fertilizer additions change with soil-test phosphorus levels across a range of soil types rarely
exist. Owing to this uncertainty, most soil-testing laboratories make phosphorus fertilizer recommen-
dations based on probability of response using class interval grouping such as low, medium, and high.

Crops produced on a soil scoring very low or low have a very high probability of responding to mod-
erate to high rates of fertilization. Crops produced on soils classiﬁed as medium frequently respond to
moderate rates of fertilization, and typically, crops produced on soils testing high for phosphorus would
not respond to fertilization (Table 3.4). General soil-test phosphorus interpretations for mineral soils in
California and Florida are shown in Tables 3.5 and 3.6 for comparative purposes. In California, only
the probability of response to NaHCO3-phosphorus is indicated, and it is presumed that speciﬁc fertil-
izer  recommendations  are  left  to  service  laboratories, crop  consultants, or  the  grower.  In  Florida,
speciﬁc fertilizer recommendations for phosphorus are made for each level of M-I-extractable phos-
phorus. Furthermore, research aimed at validating and calibrating soil-test fertilizer recommendations
for phosphorus in Florida is ongoing (63–65). It must be stressed that all fertilizer recommendations
must  be  calibrated  locally, and  readers  are  advised  to  consult  the  cooperative  extension  service  for
recommendation guidelines speciﬁc to their region.

3.3 FACTORS AFFECTING MANAGEMENT OF PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION

3.3.1 CROP RESPONSE TO PHOSPHORUS
As noted in the previous section, the amounts of phosphorus applied to crops should be based ide-
ally on a well-calibrated soil test. However, even at a given soil-test phosphorus level, the amount
of phosphorus fertilizer required for economic-optimum yield often will vary with crop. Generally,
fast-growing, short-season  vegetable  crops  have  higher  phosphorus  requirements  than  ﬁeld  and
orchard crops. Many deciduous fruit crops infrequently respond to phosphorus fertilization even
if soil tests are low (47). It is presumed often that surface soil tests fail to characterize the full soil
volume where trees take up nutrients or the fact that trees take up nutrients over a considerable
time period.

There  is  considerable  variability  in  phosphorus  response  among  species  of  vegetable  crops
(66–70). For example, lettuce generally shows larger responses to phosphorus than most other veg-
etable crops including cucurbit and brassica species. Furthermore, genetic variation in response to
phosphorus within species also exists. For example, Buso and Bliss (71), in sand culture experiments
found that some butterhead types of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were less eﬃcient than other types
under phosphorus-deﬁcient regimes. However, the magnitude of this variation is usually small com-
pared to the uncertainties and natural variation in soil-test-based phosphorus fertilizer recommenda-
tions. Generally, ﬁeld experiments show that lettuce has a similar response to phosphorus regardless
of cultivar or morphological type (72,73). As shown by the data presented in Figure 3.7, a similar
soil-test phosphorus index level of 22 mg dm3 was required for maximum yield regardless of lettuce
type (73).

Mechanisms of phosphorus-utilization eﬃciency have been classiﬁed into three broad classes
including (a) secretion or exudation of chemical compounds into the rhizosphere, (b) variation in
the  geometry  or  architecture  of  the  root  system, and  (c)  association  with  microorganisms  (74).
Future  opportunities  for  improving  phosphorus-utilization  eﬃciency  in  crops  through  genetic
manipulation of traits exist (75).

In  conclusion, as  available  data  permit, soil-test  recommendations  for  phosphorus  should  be
customized  by  crop.  However, at  present, soil-test-based  recommendations  are  generally  not
suﬃciently sensitive to allow recommendations to accommodate the more subtle genetic variation
among cultivars within crop species.

3.3.2 SOIL WATER
Phosphorus availability is aﬀected by soil water conditions. Soil water aﬀects soil reactions gov-
erning  the  release  and  diﬀusion  of  phosphorus  in  the  soil  solution  and  ultimately  the  positional
availability of phosphorus relative to root growth. Generally, maximum availability of phosphorus
for most crops has been associated with a soil water tension of about 1/3 bar (76).

The dissolution of fertilizer phosphorus and all amorphous and mineral phosphorus compounds
in  the  soil  depends  on  soil  water.  Furthermore, under  anaerobic  conditions, the  reduction  of  ferric

phosphates  to  ferrous  phosphates  might  result  in  additional  increased  phosphorus  solubility
(77,78).  Nevertheless, it  is  the  general  view  that  with  the  exception  of  aquatic  crops, excessive
water  resulting  in  poor  aeration  would  actually  restrict  phosphorus  uptake  by  crops  in  spite  of  this
enhanced  solubility.  However, Bacon  and  Davey  (79), using  trickle  irrigation  in  an  orchard, noted
increased phosphorus availability during and immediately after each irrigation and noted that available
phosphorus decreased rapidly as soil moisture declined below ﬁeld capacity. These authors attributed
this  increased  phosphorus  availability  to  the  reduction  of  amorphous  iron  phosphates  in  anaerobic
micro-sites.

The  volume  of  soil  that  is  occupied  by  water  aﬀects  the  cross-sectional  area  through  which
phosphorus  can  diﬀuse  (80).  Thus, the  lower  the  soil  moisture, the  more  tortuous  the  path  of
diﬀusion  and  the  greater  the  likelihood  of  contact  with  soil  constituents  that  render  phosphorus
insoluble.

Under most conditions, phosphorus is applied near the soil surface. Thus, during dry periods in
nonirrigated production systems, crops largely draw soil moisture from lower soil depths, and phos-
phorus deﬁciencies can arise (81). This condition is generally not a problem in irrigated production
systems where root growth extends to near the soil surface.

3.3.3 SOIL TEMPERATURE
Soil temperature aﬀects reactions that govern the dissolution, adsorption and diﬀusion of phospho-
rus. Although sorption and desorption generally occur concurrently, an increase in soil temperature
increases kinetics of reactions (82) and enables more rapid equilibration among nonlabile, labile,
and  solution  phosphorus  pools, resulting  in  more  rapid  replenishment  of  solution  phosphorus  as
phosphorus is taken up by crops. Sutton (83) concluded that most of the eﬀect of temperature on
available  phosphorus  was  due  to  inorganic  reactions, since  the  eﬀect  occurred  too  rapidly  to  be
explained by microbial mineralization.

Soil temperature also has the potential to aﬀect root uptake of phosphorus. With excised corn
roots in solution culture experiments, Carter and Lathwell (84) reported that absorption increased
as temperature was increased from 20 to 40⬚C. The eﬀects of temperature on soil reactions may be
more important than eﬀects on plant physiology. Singh and Jones (85) noted that changes in tem-
perature had a more pronounced eﬀect on the phosphorus nutrition of Boston lettuce in soil culture
than in solution culture.

In production systems where crops are seeded and harvested over the same time interval each
year, soil temperature is unlikely to substantially confound soil-test-based fertilizer recommenda-
tions for phosphorus. However, in crop production situations where planting and harvesting are
extended  over  seasonal  changes, such  as  many  vegetable  production  systems, temperature
changes can aﬀect the amount of fertilizer required for maximum production. Lingle and Davis
(86) reported that tomatoes seeded in cool soils showed a larger growth (dry mass) response to
phosphorus  than  those  seeded  in  warm  soils.  Locascio  and  Warren  (87)  noted  that  tomato
(Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) growth increased with applications up to 550 kg P/ha at 13⬚C but
only to 140 kg P/ha at 21 or 30⬚C. Research has shown that the phosphorus rate required for max-
imum  production  of  lettuce  in  deserts  increased  as  temperatures  during  the  growing  season
decreased (88,89). Lettuce produced in the desert of southwestern United States is planted every
day from September through January and is harvested daily from November through April with
mean soil temperatures ranging from 4 to 18⬚C. As illustrated in Figure 3.8, soil-test levels for
phosphorus requirement for maximum lettuce yield decreased as mean soil temperature during
the growing season increased.

3.3.4 SOURCES OF PHOSPHORUS
Most  phosphorus-containing  fertilizers  are  derived  from  mined  phosphate  rock.  In  some  unique
production situations on acidic soils, phosphate rock can be used directly as a phosphorus source.
Most cropping systems show the best response to water-soluble phosphorus fertilizers. Water-solu-
ble phosphorus fertilizers are produced by reacting phosphate rock with sulfuric or phosphoric acid
(90). Ammonium phosphates are made by passing anhydrous ammonia through phosphoric acid.
This production includes diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate.

The agronomic eﬀectiveness of phosphorus fertilizers was reviewed by Engelstad and Terman (91).
Most crops require readily available phosphorus, and most soluble sources perform similarly. However,
in some situations the ammonium phosphates produce phytotoxicity (92), and their use is often discour-
aged when high amounts of phosphorus are required. For example, for economic reasons, diammonium
phosphate typically is broadcast applied for lettuce production in the southwestern desert, but its use is
discouraged when broadcast rates are high or when phosphorus fertilizer is banded near the plants.

Soluble, dry fertilizers and solution fertilizers perform similarly under many production sys-
tems. However, there are some unique production situations where solution sources may present
logistical advantages. Often solution sources are easier to use in band placement or point-injection
technologies. Generally, solution sources would be utilized in application with irrigation water.

In conclusion, under most conditions, cost considerations, available application technologies,
and the potential for phytotoxicity are the major determining factors inﬂuencing the selection of
sources of phosphorus fertilizers.

3.3.5 TIMING OF APPLICATION OF PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS
Overwhelming evidence indicates that for annual crops, phosphorus fertilizers should largely be
applied preplant. Phosphorus moves to plant roots primarily by diﬀusion, and young seedlings of
most annual crops are very sensitive to phosphorus deﬁcits. Furthermore, yields of some crops often
fail to recover fully from transitory phosphorus deﬁcits (93).

Grunes et al. (94) showed that the proportion of fertilizer phosphorus absorbed by sugar beets
(Beta  vulgaris L.)  decreased  as  the  time  of  application  was  delayed.  Lingle  and  Wright  (95)
reported that muskmelons (Cucumis melo L.), which showed large responses to phosphorus at seed-
ing, showed no response to sidedressed phosphorus fertilization. Sanchez et al. (96) reported that a
preplant phosphorus deﬁcit in lettuce could not be corrected by sidedressed fertilization. Preplant
broadcast or band applications are usually recommended for annual crops.

3.3.6 PLACEMENT OF PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS
The literature contains many accounts recording the positive eﬀects of applying phosphorus fertil-
izer to a localized area, usually near the plant roots, as opposed to a general soil broadcast applica-
tion. Reviews on the subject of fertilizer placement should be consulted for detailed information
(97,98). Localized placement of phosphorus fertilizers might include row, band, or strip placement.
It is generally presumed that a localized or band application reduces fertilizer contact with the
soil thereby resulting in less phosphorus sorption and precipitation reactions and, thus, enhanced
availability to crops. However, for soils with a high phosphorus-ﬁxing capacity, where phosphorus
is relatively immobile, placement of the fertilizer where root contact is enhanced may be an equally
or more important mechanism than restricting ﬁxation (99–101).

The relative beneﬁts of localized placement of phosphorus fertilizers are neither constant nor
universal across crop production situations. This fact is illustrated by a series of experiments that
the  author  conducted  to  improve  phosphorus  fertilizer  use  for  vegetable  crops  produced  on
Histosols (102,103). The amount of phosphorus required for lettuce production could be reduced
by  at  least  50%  if  phosphorus  was  banded  instead  of  broadcast  (Figure  3.9).  However, band
placement was not a viable strategy for improving phosphorus-use eﬃciency for celery under the

existing  production  system.  For  sweet  corn  (Zea  mays  rugosa Bonaf.), the  relative  eﬃciency  of
banded to broadcast phosphorus depended on soil-test level (Figure 3.10). The relative eﬃciency
was greater than 3:1 (band:broadcast) at low soil-test phosphorus levels but approached 1:1 as soil-
test phosphorus approached the critical value. Others have reported a relationship between the rel-
ative  eﬃciency  of  the  localized  placement  of  phosphorus  and  soil-test  levels  (105–107).  Many
factors including crop root morphology, length of crop growing season, soil chemical and physical
characteristics, and crop cultural practices interact to inﬂuence the relative crop response to broad-
cast or band fertilization.

3.3.7 FOLIAR-APPLIED PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION
Foliar fertilization with phosphorus is generally not practiced to the extent that it is done with nitro-
gen and micronutrient fertilizers although a limited amount of fertilizer phosphorus can be absorbed
by plant foliage. Silberstein and Witwer (108) tested various organic and inorganic phosphorus-con-
taining compounds on vegetable crops. They generally observed small responses in plant growth,
but some compounds caused injury at phosphorus concentrations as low as 0.16%. They concluded
that orthophosphoric acid was the most eﬀective foliar phosphorus fertilizer evaluated. Barrel and
Black (109,110) reported that several condensed phosphates and some phosphate fertilizers con-
taining phosphorus and nitrogen could be applied at 2.5 to 3 times the quantity of orthophosphate
without causing leaf damage. Yields of corn and soybeans (Glycine max Merr.) were higher with
tri-polyphosphate and tetra-polyphosphate than with orthophosphate.

Teubner (111) reported that although about 12% of the phosphorus in the harvested plant parts
of some ﬁeld-grown vegetable crops could be supplied through multiple foliar sprays, foliar phos-
phorus  fertilization  did  not  increase  total  phosphorus  absorbed  or  crop  yields.  Upadhyay  (112)
reported that the yield of soybeans were highest when all fertilizer phosphorus was soil-applied,
intermediate  where  50%  of  the  phosphorus  was  soil-applied  and  50%  foliar-applied, and  lowest
where all the phosphorus was foliar-applied.

Some research suggests that phosphorus in combination with other nutrients might delay senes-
cence and increase yields, but results are inconsistent. Garcia and Hanway (113) reported that foliar
applications of N, P, K, and S mixtures during seed ﬁlling seemed to delay senescence and increase
yield in soybean and the complete mixture produced greater yields than foliar sprays where the mix-
ture was incomplete. Subsequent work with soybeans by others ranged from no-yield response (114)
to yield reduction (115) for foliar mixtures containing phosphorus. Similar negative responses have
been obtained with other crops. Harder et al. (116,117) observed temporary decrease in photosyn-
thesis and a decrease in grain yield of corn (Zea mays L.) receiving foliar N, P, K, and S. Batten and
Wardlaw  (118)  reported  that  applying  monobasic  ammonium  phosphate  to  the  ﬂag-leaf  of  phos-
phate-deﬁcient wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) delayed senescence but failed to increase grain yield.
Because only a modest portion of the crop’s total phosphorus requirement can be met by foliar
application and foliar fertilization does not produce consistent positive responses where residual
soil phosphorus or soil-applied fertilizer phosphorus is suﬃcient, foliar fertilization with phospho-
rus is seldom recommended as a substitute for soil fertilization practices.

3.3.8 FERTILIZATION IN IRRIGATION WATER
Although application of fertilizer in irrigation water (fertigation) is a common practice with mobile
nutrients such as nitrogen, it is less common with phosphorus because of concerns about eﬃciency
of utilization. Owing to the soil reactions discussed in a previous section, it is often presumed that
much  of  the  phosphorus  applied  with  water  will  be  tied  up  at  its  point  of  contact  with  the  soil.
Nevertheless, there are some situations where fertigation is a viable and economical means of deliv-
ering phosphorus for crop production.

The downward movement of phosphorus in soil is inﬂuenced strongly by soil texture as shown
in the laboratory (119,120) and ﬁeld experiments (121,122). In one study, sprinkler-applied phos-
phorus moved to a depth of approximately 5 cm in a clay loam soil and to approximately 18 cm in
a loamy sand (121). On a basin surface-irrigated Superstition sand that received 91 cm of water,
phosphorus moved to a depth of 45 cm (123).

Phosphorus  source  seems  to  be  another  important  factor  aﬀecting  phosphorus  movement  in
soils and thus the eﬃcacy of fertigation. Stanberry et al. (124), using radioautographs to trace P32
movement  in  Superstition  sand, noted  that  phosphorus  from  phosphoric  acid  and  monocalcium
phosphate moved vertically across the length of the photographic ﬁlm (20 cm) compared to dical-
cium  phosphate  and  tricalcium  phosphate, which  showed  negligible  movement.  Lauer  (122)

CRC_DK2972_Ch003.qxd  6/30/2006  1:15 PM  Page 82

82

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

reported that sprinkler-applied monoammonium phosphate, urea phosphate, and phosphoric acid
showed similar movement in soils. However, ammonium polyphosphate penetrated only to 60 to
70% of the depth of the other sources. Rauschkolb (125) reported that glycerophosphate moved
slightly farther than orthophosphate when injected through a trickle-irrigation system but phospho-
rus from both sources moved a suﬃcient distance into the root zone such that phosphorus avail-
ability was adequate for tomatoes. O’Neill (126) reported that orthophosphoric acid applied in the
irrigation water for trickle-irrigated citrus (Citrus spp. L.) was delivered to a greater soil volume
than triple superphosphate applied directly below the emitter. The phosphoric acid also lowered the
pH of the irrigation water suﬃciently to eliminate clogging problems associated with the precipita-
tion of phosphorus in the irrigation lines.

In established perennial crops such as citrus or deciduous fruits, fertigation is often a viable means
of phosphorus delivery, regardless of the method of irrigation, because tractor application and incorpo-
ration  would  likely  cause  root  damage  and  broadcast  application  would  not  necessarily  be  more
eﬃcient than fertigation. For fast-growing annual crops, where most phosphorus should be applied pre-
plant, fertigation might not result consistently in production beneﬁts compared to band application but
might be economical or even necessary depending on the opportunities and constraints of the irrigation
delivery system. Bar-Yosef et al. (127) noted no diﬀerence between broadcast and drip-injected phos-
phorus for sweet corn on a sandy soil. Carrijo et al. (128) reported that phosphorus applied through the
irrigation system was more eﬃcient than preplant incorporation for tomato produced on sandy soils
testing low in phosphorus. Reports that phosphorus fertigation sometimes produced positive responses
have been attributed to band-like eﬀects where phosphorus is delivered in or close to the root zone and
not widely mixed with the soil (128,129). Overall, the eﬃcacy of phosphorus fertigation depends on
soil texture, phosphorus source, irrigation method and amount, and cropping system utilized.

4.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION
Ever since ancient classical times, materials that contained potassium have been used as fertilizers,
such  as  excrement, bird  manure, and  ashes  (1), and  these  materials  certainly  contributed  to  crop
growth and soil fertility. However, in those days people did not think in terms of modern chemical ele-
ments. Even an excellent pioneer of modern chemistry, Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier (1743–1794),
assumed that the favorable eﬀect of animal excrement was due to the humus present in it (2). Humphry
Davy  (1778–1827)  discovered  the  chemical  element  potassium  and  Martin  Heinrich  Klaproth
(1743–1817) was the ﬁrst person to identify potassium in plant sap (3). Home (1762, quoted in 4)
noted in pot experiments that potassium promoted plant growth. Carl Sprengel (1787–1859) was the

ﬁrst to propagate the idea that plants feed from inorganic nutrients and thus also from potassium (5).
Justus Liebig (1803–1873) emphasized the importance of inorganic plant nutrients as cycling between
the living nature and the inorganic nature, mediated by plants (6). He quoted that farmers in the area
of Giessen fertilized their ﬁelds with charcoal burners’ ash and prophesied that future farmers would
fertilize their ﬁelds with potassium salts and with the ash of burned straw. The ﬁrst potash mines for
the production of potash fertilizer were sunk at Stassfurt, Germany in 1860.

4.2 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Numerous solution culture and pot experiments with K⫹-free substrates have shown that plants do
not grow without K⫹. As soon as the potassium reserves of the seed are exhausted, plants die. This
condition may also occur on strongly K⫹-ﬁxing soils. In contrast to other plant nutrients such as N,
S, and P, there are hardly any organic constituents known with K⫹ as a building element. Potassium
ions activate various enzymes, which may also be activated by other univalent cationic species with
⫹, Rb⫹, and Cs⫹ (7). These other species, however, play
a similar size and water mantle such as NH4
⫹ in the tis-
no major role under natural conditions as the concentrations of Cs⫹, Rb⫹, and also NH4
sues  are  low  and  will  not  reach  the  activation  concentration  required.  In  vitro  experiments  have
shown that maximum activation is obtained within a concentration range of 0.050 to 0.080 M K⫹.
Ammonium may attain high concentrations in the soil solution of  ﬂooded soils, and ammonium
uptake rates of plant species such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) are very high. In the cytosol, however,
⫹ is assimilated rapidly, as was shown for rice
no high NH4
(8). Activation of enzymes in vivo may occur at the same high K⫹ concentration as seen in in vitro
experiments, as was shown for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (9).

⫹ concentrations build up because NH4

It is assumed that K⫹ binds to the enzyme surface, changing the enzymic conformation and thus
leading to enzyme activation. Recent research has shown that in the enzyme dialkyl-glycine car-
boxylase, K⫹ is centered in an octahedron with O atoms at the six corners. As shown in Figure 4.1,
these O atoms are provided by three amino acyls, one water molecule, and the O of hydroxyl groups
of  each  of  serine  and  aspartate  (10). As  compared  with  Na⫹, the  K⫹ binding  is  very  selective
because the dehydration energy required for K⫹ is much lower than for Na⫹. If the latter binds to
the enzyme, the natural conformation of the enzyme is distorted, and the access of the substrate to
the binding site is blocked. Lithium ions (Li⫹) inactivate the enzyme in an analogous way. It is sup-
posed that in most K⫹-activated enzymes, the required conformation change is brought about by the
central position of K⫹ in the octahedron, where its positive charge attracts the negative site of the
O atom located at each corner of the octahedron. This conformation is a unique structure that gives
evidence of the unique function of K⫹. In this context, it is of interest that the diﬀerence between
K⫹ and Na⫹ binding to the enzyme is analogous to the adsorption of the cationic species to the

interlayer of some 2:1 clay minerals, where the adsorption of K⫹ is associated with the dehydration
of the K⫹, thus leading to a shrinkage of the mineral; Na⫹ is not dehydrated and if it is adsorbed to
the interlayer, the mineral is expanded.

It is not yet known how many diﬀerent enzymes activated by K⫹ possess this octahedron as the
active site. There is another enzyme of paramount importance in which the activity is increased by K⫹,
namely the plasmalemma H⫹-ATPase. This enzyme is responsible for excreting H⫹ from the cell. As
can be seen from Table 4.1 the rate of H⫹ excretion by young corn (Zea mays L.) roots depends on
the cationic species in the outer solution, with the lowest rate seen in the control treatment, which was
free  of  ions. The  highest  H⫹ release  rate  was  in  the  treatment  with  K⫹.  Since  the  other  cationic
species had a promoting eﬀect on the H⫹ release relative to pure water, the inﬂuence of K⫹ is not
speciﬁc. However, a quantitative superiority of K⫹ relative to other cations may have a beneﬁcial
impact on plant metabolism since the H⫹ concentration in the apoplast of root cells is of importance
for nutrients and metabolites taken up by H⫹ cotransport as well as for the retrieval of such metabo-
lites (11). The beneﬁcial eﬀect of cations in the outer solution is thought to originate from cation
uptake, which leads to depolarization of the plasma membrane so that H⫹ pumping out of the cytosol
requires less energy. This depolarizing eﬀect was highest with K⫹, which is taken up at high rates
relative to other cationic species. High K⫹ uptake rates and a relatively high permeability of the plas-
malemma for K⫹ are further characteristics of K⫹, which may also diﬀuse out of the cytosol across
the plasma membrane back into the outer solution.

4.2.1 FUNCTION IN PLANTS

4.2.1.1 Enzyme Activation

The function of potassium in enzyme activation was considered in the preceding section.

4.2.1.2 Protein Synthesis

A probable function of potassium is in polypeptide synthesis in the ribosomes, since that process
requires a high K⫹ concentration (12). Up to now, however, it is not clear which particular enzyme
or ribosomal site is activated by K⫹. There is indirect evidence that protein synthesis requires K⫹
(13). Salinity from Na⫹ may aﬀect protein synthesis because of an insuﬃcient K⫹ concentration in
leaves and roots, as shown in Table 4.2 (14). Sodium chloride salinity had no major impact on the
uptake  of  15N-labelled  inorganic  N  but  severely  depressed  its  assimilation  and  the  synthesis  of
labelled  protein.  In  the  treatment  with  additional  K⫹ in  the  nutrient  solution, particularly  in  the
treatment with 10 mM K⫹, assimilation of inorganic N and protein synthesis were at least as good
as in the control treatment (no salinity). In the salinity treatment without additional K⫹, the K⫹ con-
centrations in roots and shoots were greatly depressed. Additional K⫹ raised the K⫹ concentrations
in roots and shoots to levels that were even higher than the K⫹ concentration in the control treat-
ment, and at this high cytosolic K⫹ level, protein synthesis was not depressed.

4.2.1.3 Ion Absorption and Transport

4.2.1.3.1 Potassium Absorption
Plant membranes are relatively permeable to K⫹ due to various selective K⫹ channels across the
membrane. Basically, one distinguishes between low-aﬃnity K⫹ channels and high-aﬃnity chan-
nels.  For  the  function  of  the  low-aﬃnity  channels, the  electrochemical  diﬀerence  between  the
cytosol and the outer medium (liquid in root or leaf apoplast) is of decisive importance. The K⫹ is
imported into the cell for as long as the electrochemical potential in the cytosol is lower than in the
outer solution. With the import of the positive charge (K⫹) the electrochemical potential increases
(decrease of the negative charge of the cytosol) and ﬁnally attains that of the outer medium, equi-
librium is attained, and there is no further driving force for the uptake of K⫹ (15). The negative
charge  of  the  cytosol  is  maintained  by  the  activity  of  the  plasmalemma  H⫹ pump  permanently
excreting H⫹ from the cytosol into the apoplast and thus maintaining the high negative charge of
the cytosol and building up an electropotential diﬀerence between the cytosol and the apoplast in
the range of 120 to 200 mV. If the plasmalemma H⫹ pumping is aﬀected (e.g., by an insuﬃcient
ATP supply), the negative charge of the cytosol drops, and with it the capacity to retain K⫹, which
then streams down the electrochemical gradient through the low-aﬃnity channel, from the cytosol
and into the apoplast. Thus in roots, K⫹ may be lost to the soil, which is, for example, the case under
anaerobic conditions. This movement along the electrochemical gradient is also called facilitated
diﬀusion, and the channels mediating facilitated diﬀusion are known as rectifying channels (16).
Inwardly and outwardly directed K⫹ channels occur, by which uptake and retention of K⫹ are reg-
ulated (17). Their ‘gating’ (opening and closure) are controlled by the electropotential diﬀerence
between the cytosol and the apoplast. If this diﬀerence is below the electrochemical equilibrium,
which means that the negative charge of the cytosol is relatively low, outwardly directed channels
are opened and vice versa. The plasmalemma H⫹-ATPase activity controls the negative charge of
the cytosol to a high degree since each H⫹ pumped out of the cytosol into the apoplast results in an
increase of the negative charge of the cytosol. Accordingly, hampering the ATPase (e.g., by low
temperature) results in an outwardly directed diﬀusion of K⫹ (18). Also, in growing plants, dark-
ness leads to a remarkable eﬄux of K⫹ into the outer solution, as shown in Figure 4.2. Within a
period of 4 days, the K⫹ concentration in the nutrient solution in which maize seedlings were grown
increased steadily under dark conditions, whereas in light it remained at a low level of ⬍10 µM
(19). The outwardly directed channels may be blocked by Ca2⫹ (20). The blocking may be respon-
sible  for  the  so-called  Viets  eﬀect (21), which  results  in  an  enhanced  net  uptake  of  potassium
through a decrease in K⫹ eﬄux (22).

Perspectives  on  the  Effects  of  Potassium  on  Physiology  of  Plants.  Norcross, GA: Potash  and  Phosphate
Institute, 1999, pp. 1–11.)

4.2.1.3.2 Potassium Transport within Tissues
Opening and closure of K⫹ channels are of particular relevance for guard cells (23), and the mech-
anism of this action is controlled by the reception of red light, which induces stomatal opening (24).
Diurnal rhythms of K⫹ uptake were also found by Le Bot and Kirkby (25) and by MacDuﬀ and
Dhanoa  (26), with  highest  uptake  rates  at  noon  and  lowest  at  midnight.  Energy  supply  is  not 
the controlling mechanism, which still needs elucidation (26). Owing to the low-aﬃnity channels,
K⫹ can be quickly transported within a tissue, and also from one tissue to another. This feature of
K⫹ does not apply for other plant nutrients. The low-aﬃnity channel transport requires a relatively
high  K⫹ concentration  in  the  range  of  ⬎0.1 mM  (17).  This  action  is  mainly  the  case  in  leaf
apoplasts, where the xylem sap has K⫹ concentrations ⬎ 1 mM (27). At the root surface, the K⫹
concentrations may be lower than 0.1 mM, and here high-aﬃnity K⫹ channels are required, as well
as low-aﬃnity channels, for K⫹ uptake.

The principle of high-aﬃnity transport is a symport or a cotransport, where K⫹ is transported
together with another cationic species such as H⫹ or even Na⫹. The K⫹–H⫹ or K⫹–Na⫹ complex
behaves  like  a  bivalent  cation  and  has  therefore  a  much  stronger  driving  force  along  the  electro-
chemical gradient. Hence, K⫹ present near the root surface in micromolar concentrations is taken up.
Because of these selective K⫹ transport systems, K⫹ is taken up from the soil solution at high
rates and is quickly distributed in plant tissues and cell organelles (28). Potassium ion distribution
in the cell follows a particular strategy, with a tendency to maintain a high K⫹ concentration in the
cytosol, the so-called cytoplasmic potassium homeostasis, and the vacuole functions as a storage
organelle for K⫹ (29). Besides the H⫹-ATPase, a pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) is also located in the
tonoplast, for which the substrate is pyrophosphate. The enzyme not only pumps H⫹ but also K⫹
into the vacuole, and thus functions in the cytoplasmic homeostasis (Figure 4.3). This mechanism
is an uphill transport because the vacuole liquid is less negatively charged than the cytosol. In Table
4.3, the typical pattern of K⫹ concentration in relation to K⫹ supply is shown (30). The cytosolic
K⫹ concentration remains at a high level almost independently of the K⫹ concentration in the nutri-
ent solution, whereas the vacuolar K⫹ concentration reﬂects that of the nutrient solution.

4.2.1.3.3 Osmotic Function
The high cytosolic K⫹ concentration required for polypeptide synthesis is particularly important in
growing tissues; the K⫹ in the vacuole not only represents K⫹ storage but also functions as an indis-
pensable osmoticum. In most cells, the volume of the vacuole is relatively large, and its turgor is
essential  for  the  tissue  turgor. The  osmotic  function  is  not  a  speciﬁc  one  as  there  are  numerous

organic and inorganic osmotica in plants. There is a question, however, as to whether these can be
provided quickly to fast-growing tissues, and in most cases it is the K⫹ that is delivered at suﬃcient
rates. In natrophilic species, Na⫹ may substitute for K⫹ in this osmotic function. The high vacuolar
turgor in expanding cells produces the pressure potential required for growth. This pressure may be
insuﬃcient  (p⬍ 0 . 6 MPa)  in  plants  suﬀering  from  K⫹ deﬁciency  (31).  In  Figure  4.4, pressure
potentials and the related cell size in leaves of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are shown.
Pressure potentials (turgor) were signiﬁcantly higher in the treatment with suﬃcient K⫹ compared
with insuﬃcient K⫹ supply. This higher turgor (ψ
p) promoted cell expansion, as shown in the lower
part of Figure 4.4. From numerous observations, it is well known that plants insuﬃciently supplied
with K⫹ soon lose their turgor when exposed to water stress. In recent experiments it was found that
K⫹ increased the turgor and promoted growth in cambial tissue (32). The number of expanding cells
derived from cambium was reduced with insuﬃcient K⫹ nutrition.

4.2.1.4 Photosynthesis and Respiration

Potassium ion transport across chloroplast and mitochondrial membranes is related closely to the
energy status of plants. In earlier work, it was shown that K⫹ had a favorable inﬂuence on photore-
duction and photophosphorylation (33). More recently, it was found that an ATPase located in the

inner membrane of chloroplasts pumps H⫹ out of the stroma and thus induces a K⫹ inﬂux into the
stroma via selective channels (34). The K⫹ is essential for H⫹ pumping by the envelope-located
ATPase (35). Were it not for a system to pump H⫹ from the illuminated chloroplast, the increase in
stromal  pH  induced  by  the  electron  ﬂow  in  the  photosynthetic  electron-transport  chain  would
quickly dissipate (34). This high pH is a prerequisite for an eﬃcient transfer of light energy into
chemical energy, as was shown by a faster rate of O2 production by photolysis in plants treated with
higher K⫹ concentration (36). The favorable eﬀect of K⫹ on CO2 assimilation is well documented
(37,38). An increase in leaf K⫹ concentration was paralleled by an increase in CO2 assimilation and
by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration (38). Obviously, photosynthetic ATP supply substituted
for  mitochondrial ATP  in  the  leaves  with  the  high  K⫹ concentration. Thus, K⫹ had  a  beneﬁcial
impact on the energy status of the plant.

4.2.1.5 Long-Distance Transport
Long-distance transport of K⫹ occurs in the xylem and phloem vessels. Loading of the xylem occurs
mainly in the root central cylinder, where protoxylem and xylem vessels are located adjacent to xylem

CRC_DK2972_Ch004.qxd  6/30/2006  1:55 PM  Page 98

parenchyma cells. The K⫹ accumulates in the parenchyma cells (Figure 4.5) and is transported from
there across the plasmalemma and the primary cell wall and through pits of the secondary cell wall
into the xylem vessels (39). There is evidence that the outward-rectifying channels allow a K⫹ ﬂux
(facilitated diﬀusion) from the parenchyma cells into the xylem vessel (40,41). The release of K⫹ into
the xylem sap decreases its water potential and thus favors the uptake of water (42). The direction of
xylem sap transport goes along the transpiration stream and hence from root to leaves. The direction
of the phloem sap transport depends on the physiological conditions and goes toward the strongest
sinks. These may be young growing leaves, storage cells of roots, or ﬂeshy fruits like tomato.

Phloem sap is rich in K⫹, with a concentration range of 60 to 100 mM (43). Potassium ions are
important for phloem loading and thus phloem transport. It was shown that K⫹ particularly promotes
the uptake of sucrose and glutamine into the sieve cells at high apoplastic pH (44). These metabo-
lites presumably are taken up into the sieve vessels via a K⫹ cotransport (Figure 4.5). This process
is important, since in cases in which insuﬃcient H⫹ are provided by the plasmalemma H⫹ pump, and
thus the apoplastic pH is too high for a H⫹ cotransport of metabolites, K⫹ can substitute for H⫹ and
the most important metabolites required for growth and storage, sucrose and amino compounds, can
be transported along the phloem. Hence the apoplastic K⫹ concentration contributes much to phloem
loading (Figure 4.5). This occurrence is in line with the observation that the phloem ﬂow rate in cas-
tor bean (Ricinus communis L.) was higher in plants well supplied with K⫹ than in plants with a low
K⫹ status (43). The favorable eﬀect of K⫹ on the transport of assimilates to growing plant organs has
been shown by various authors (45).

Potassium ions cycle via xylem from roots to upper plant parts and via phloem from leaves to
roots. The direction depends on the physiological demand. During the vegetative stage, the primary
meristem is the strongest sink. Here, K⫹ is needed for stimulating the plasmalemma ATPase that pro-
duces the necessary conditions for the uptake of metabolites, such as sucrose and amino acids. High
K⫹ concentrations are required in the cytosol for protein synthesis and in the vacuole for cell expan-
sion (Figure 4.4). During the generative or reproductive phase, the K⫹ demand depends on whether
or not fruits rich in water are produced, such as apples or vine berries. These fruits need K⫹ mainly
for osmotic balance. Organs with a low water content, such as cereal grains, seeds, nuts, and cotton
bolls, do not require K⫹ to a great extent. Provided that cereals are well supplied with K⫹ during the
vegetative stage, K⫹ supply during the generative stage has no major impact on grain formation (46).

However, for optimum grain ﬁlling, a high K⫹ concentration in the leaves is required for the translo-
cation of assimilates to the grains and for protein synthesis in these grains (47).

The generative phase of cereal growth requires hardly any K⫹, but still appreciable amounts
of N. In such cases, nitrate uptake of the plants is high and K⫹ uptake low. The K⫹ is recycled via
the phloem from the leaves to the roots, where K⫹ may enter the xylem again and balance the neg-
⫺ (48). Both the ionic species, K⫹ and nitrate, are eﬃcient osmotica and are
ative charge of the NO3
thus of importance for the uptake of water into the xylem (49). In the phloem sap, K⫹ balances the
negative charge of organic and inorganic anions.

In storage roots and tubers, K⫹ is required not only for osmotic reasons, but it may also have a
more speciﬁc function. From work with sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) roots, a K⫹-sucrose cotrans-
port across the tonoplast into the vacuole, driven by an H⫹/K⫹ antiport cycling the K⫹ back into the
cytosol, was postulated (50).

4.3 DIAGNOSIS OF POTASSIUM STATUS IN PLANTS

4.3.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY
The beginning of K⫹ deﬁciency in plants is growth retardation, which is a rather nonspeciﬁc symp-
tom and is thus not easily recognized as K⫹ deﬁciency. The growth rate of internodes is aﬀected
(51), and some dicotyledonous species may form rosettes (52). With the advance of K⫹ deﬁciency,
old  leaves  show  the  ﬁrst  symptoms  as  under  such  conditions  K⫹ is  translocated  from  older  to
younger  leaves  and  growing  tips  via  the  phloem.  In  most  plant  species, the  older  leaves  show
chlorotic and necrotic symptoms as small stripes along the leaf margins, beginning at the tips and
enlarging along leaf margins in the basal direction. This type of symptom is particularly typical for
monocotyledonous species. The leaf margins are especially low in K⫹, and for this reason, they lose
turgor, and the leaves appear  ﬂaccid. This symptom is particularly obvious in cases of a critical
water supply. In some plant species, e.g., white clover (Trifolium  repens L.), white and necrotic
spots appear in the intercostal areas of mature leaves, and frequently, these areas are curved in an
upward direction. Such symptoms result from a shrinkage and death of cells (53) because of an
insuﬃcient turgor. Growth and diﬀerentiation of xylem and phloem tissue is hampered more than
the growth of the cortex. Thus, the stability and elasticity of stems is reduced so that plants are more
prone to lodging (54). In tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruits insuﬃciently supplied with
K⫹, maturation is disturbed, and the tissue around the fruit stem remains hard and green (55). The
symptom is called greenback and it has a severe negative impact on the quality of tomato.

At  an  advanced  stage  of  K⫹ deﬁciency, chloroplasts  (56)  and  mitochondria  collapse  (57).
Potassium-deﬁcient plants have a low-energy status (58) because, as shown above, K⫹ is essential
for  eﬃcient  energy  transfer  in  chloroplasts  and  mitochondria.  This  deﬁciency  has  an  impact  on
numerous synthetic processes, such as synthesis of sugar and starch, lipids, and ascorbate (59) and
also  on  the  formation  of  leaf  cuticles. The  latter  are  poorly  developed  under  K⫹ deﬁciency  (15).
Cuticles protect plants against water loss and infection by fungi. This poor development of cuticles
is one reason why plants suﬀering from insuﬃcient K⫹ have a high water demand and a poor water
use  eﬃciency (WUE, grams  of  fresh  beet  root  matter  per  grams  of  water  consumed).  Sugar  beet
grown with insuﬃcient K⫹, and therefore showing typical K⫹ deﬁciency, had a WUE of 5.5. Beet
plants with a better, but not yet optimum, K⫹ supply, and showing no visible K⫹ deﬁciency symp-
toms, had a WUE of 13.1, and beet plants suﬃciently supplied with K⫹ had a WUE of 15.4 (60).
Analogous results were found for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in solution culture (61). The
beneﬁcial eﬀect of K⫹ on reducing fungal infection has been observed by various authors (54,61,62).
The water-economizing eﬀect of K⫹ and its protective eﬃciency against fungal infection are of great
ecological relevance.

Severe K⫹ deﬁciency leads to the synthesis of toxic amines such as putrescine and agmatine; in
the reaction sequence arginine is the precursor (63). The synthetic pathway is induced by a low

CRC_DK2972_Ch004.qxd  6/30/2006  1:55 PM  Page 100

cytosolic pH, which presumably results from insuﬃcient pumping of H⫹ out of the cell by the plas-
malemma H⫹-ATPase, which requires K⫹ for full activity. The reaction sequence is as follows:

(cid:127) Arginine is decarboxylated to agmatine
(cid:127) Agmatine is deaminated to carbamylputrescine
(cid:127) Carbamylputrescine is hydrolyzed into putrescine and carbamic acid

4.3.2 SYMPTOMS OF EXCESS
Excess K⫹ in plants is rare as K⫹ uptake is regulated strictly (64). The oversupply of K⫹ is not char-
acterized by speciﬁc symptoms, but it may depress plant growth and yield (65). Excess K⫹ supply
has an impact on the uptake of other cationic species and may thus aﬀect crop yield and crop qual-
ity. With an increase of K⫹ availability in the soil, the uptake of Mg2⫹ and Ca2⫹ by oats (Avena
sativa L.) was reduced (66). This action may have a negative impact for forage, where higher Mg2⫹
concentrations may be desirable. The relationship between K⫹ availability and the Mg2⫹ concen-
trations  in  the  aerial  plant  parts  of  oats  at  ear  emergence  is  shown  in  Figure  4.6  (66).  From  the
graph, it  is  clear  that  the  plants  took  up  high  amounts  of  Mg2⫹ only  if  the  K⫹ supply  was  not
suﬃcient for optimum growth. High K⫹ uptake may also hamper the uptake of Ca2⫹ and thus con-
tribute to the appearance of bitter pit in apple (Malus pumila Mill.) fruits (67) and of blossom-end
rot in tomato fruits, with strong adverse eﬀects on fruit quality (55).

The phenomenon that one ion species can hamper the uptake of another has been known for
decades and is called ion antagonism or cation competition. In this competition, K⫹ is a very strong
competitor. If it is present in a relatively high concentration, it particularly aﬀects the uptake of Na⫹,
Mg2⫹, and Ca2⫹. If K⫹ is not present in the nutrient solution, the other cationic species are taken up
at high rates. This eﬀect is shown in Table 4.4 for young barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants grown
in solution culture (68). In one treatment with the barley, the K⫹ supply was interrupted for 8 days,
having  a  tremendous  impact  on  the  Na⫹, Mg2⫹, and  Ca2⫹ concentrations  in  roots  and  shoots  as
compared with the control plants with a constant supply of K⫹. The sum of cationic equivalents in
roots and shoots remained virtually the same. This ﬁnding is explained by the highly eﬃcient uptake
systems for K⫹ as compared with uptake of the other cationic species. Uptake of K⫹ leads to a par-
tial depolarization of the plasmalemma (the cytosol becomes less negative due to the inﬂux of K⫹).
This depolarization reduces the driving force for the uptake of the other cationic species, which are

otherwise taken up by facilitated diﬀusion. In the roots, the absence of K⫹ in the nutrient solution
promoted especially the accumulation of Na⫹, and the shoots showed remarkably elevated Ca2⫹ and
Mg2⫹ concentrations. Owing to the increased concentrations of cations except K⫹, the plants were
able to maintain the cation–anion balance but not the growth rate. The interruption of K⫹ supply for
only 8 days during the 2-to-3-leaf stage of barley signiﬁcantly depressed growth and yield; the grain
yield in the control treatment was 108 g/pot, and in the K⫹-interrupted treatment was 86 g/pot. This
result shows the essentiality of K⫹ and demonstrates that its function cannot be replaced by other
cationic species.

In this context, the question to what degree Na⫹ may substitute for K⫹ is of interest. The osmotic
function of K⫹ is unspeciﬁc and can be partially replaced by Na⫹, as was shown for ryegrass (Lolium
spp.) (69) and for rice (70). The Na⫹ eﬀect is particularly evident when supply with K⫹ is not opti-
mum (71). A major eﬀect of Na⫹ can be expected only if plants take up Na⫹ at high rates. In this
respect, plant species diﬀer considerably (72). Beet species (Beta vulgaris L.) and spinach (Spinacia
oleracea L.) have a high Na⫹ uptake potential, and in these species Na⫹ may substitute for K⫹ to a
major extent. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), lupins (Lupinus spp. L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea
capitata L.), oats, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Willd. ex A. Juss.), and
turnips (Brassica rapa L.) have a medium Na⫹ uptake potential; barley, ﬂax (Linum usitatissimum L.),
millet (Pennisetum glaucum R. Br.), rape (Brassica napus L.), and wheat have a low Na⫹ potential and
buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), corn, rye (Secale cereale L.), and soybean (Glycine max
Merr.) a very low Na⫹ uptake potential. However, there are also remarkable diﬀerences in the Na⫹
uptake potential between cultivars of the same species, as was shown for perennial ryegrass (Lolium
perenne L.) (73). The Na⫹ concentration in the grass decreased with K⫹ supply and was remarkably
elevated by the application of a sodium fertilizer. In sugar beet, Na⫹ can partially substitute for K⫹ in
leaf growth but not in root growth (74). This eﬀect is of interest since root growth requires phloem
transport  and  thus  phloem  loading, which  is  promoted  by  K⫹ speciﬁcally  (see  above).  The  same
applies for the import of sucrose into the storage vacuoles of sugar beet (50). Also, Na⫹ is an essen-
tial nutrient for some C4 species, where it is thought to maintain the integrity of chloroplasts (75). The
Na⫹ concentrations required are low and in the range of micronutrients.

4.4 CONCENTRATIONS OF POTASSIUM IN PLANTS
Potassium in plant tissues is almost exclusively present in the ionic form. Only a very small por-
tion  of  total  K⫹ is  bound  by  organic  ligands  via  the  e⫺ pair  of  O  atoms.  Potassium  ions  are

CRC_DK2972_Ch004.qxd  6/30/2006  1:55 PM  Page 102

102

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

dissolved in the liquids of cell walls, cytosol, and organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochon-
dria and especially in vacuoles. From this distribution, it follows that the higher the K⫹ content
of a tissue the more water it contains. These tissues have a large portion of vacuole and a low por-
tion of cell wall material. Plant organs rich in such tissues are young leaves, young roots, and
ﬂeshy  fruits.  Highest  K⫹ concentrations  are  in  the  cytosol, and  they  are  in  a  range  of  130  to 
150 mM  K⫹ (76). Vacuolar  K⫹ concentrations  range  from  about  20  to  100 mM  and  reﬂect  the 
K⫹ supply (30). The high cytosolic K⫹ concentration is typical for all eukaryotic cells (29), and
the  mechanism  that  maintains  the  high  K⫹ level  required  for  protein  synthesis  is  described 
above.

If the K⫹ concentration of plant tissues, plant organs, or total plants is expressed on a fresh
weight basis, diﬀerences in the K⫹ concentration may not be very dramatic. For practical consider-
ations, however, the K⫹ concentration is frequently related to dry matter. In such cases, tissues rich
in water show high K⫹ concentrations, since during drying the water is removed and the K⫹ remains
with the dry matter. This relationship is clearly shown in Figures 4.7a to 4.7c (77). In Figure 4.7a,
the  K⫹ concentration  in  the  tissue  water  of  ﬁeld-grown  barley  is  presented  for  treatments  with
or without  nitrogen  supply. Throughout  the  growing  period  the  K⫹ concentration  remained  at  a
level of about 200 mM. In the last phase of maturation, the K⫹ concentration increased steeply because
of water loss during the maturation process. The K⫹ concentrations in the tissue water were some-
what higher than cytosolic K⫹ concentrations. This diﬀerence is presumably due to the fact that in
experiments the water is not removed completely by tissue pressing. In Figure 4.7b, the K⫹ con-
centration is based on the dry matter. Here, in the ﬁrst phase of the growing period the K⫹ concen-
tration  increased, reaching  a  peak  at  100  days  after  sowing.  It  then  declined  steadily  until
maturation, when the concentration increased again because of a loss of tissue water. In the treat-
ment with nitrogen supply, the K⫹ concentrations were elevated because the plant matter was richer
in water than in the plants not fertilized with nitrogen. Figure 4.7c shows the K⫹ concentrations in
the tissue water during the growing period for a treatment fertilized with K⫹ and a treatment with-
out K⫹ supply. The diﬀerence in the tissue water K⫹ concentration between both treatments was
high and remained fairly constant throughout the growing period, with the exception of the matu-
ration phase.

From these ﬁndings, it is evident that the K⫹ concentration in the tissue water is a reliable indi-
cator of the K⫹ nutritional status of plants, and it is also evident that this K⫹ concentration is inde-
pendent of the age of the plant for a long period. This fact is an enormous advantage for analysis of
plants for K⫹ nutritional status compared with measuring the K⫹ concentrations related to plant dry
matter. Here, the age of the plant matter has a substantial impact on the K⫹ concentration, and the
optimum concentration depends much on the age of the plant.

Until now, almost all plant tests for K⫹ have been related to the dry matter because dry plant
matter can be stored easily. The evaluation of the K⫹ concentration in dry plant matter meets with
diﬃculties since plant age and also other factors such as nitrogen supply inﬂuence it (77). It is
for this reason that concentration ranges rather than exact K⫹ concentrations are denoted as opti-
mum if the concentration is expressed per dry weight (see Table 4.6). Measuring K⫹ concentra-
tion  in  the  plant  sap  would  be  a  more  precise  method  for  testing  the  K⫹ nutritional  status  of
plants.

Figure 4.7c shows the K⫹ concentration in tissue water during the growing period for treatments
with or without K fertilizer. There is an enormous diﬀerence in tissue water K⫹ concentration since
the  treatment  without  K  has  not  received  K  fertilizer  since  1852  (Rothamsted  ﬁeld  experiments).
Hence, potassium deﬁciency is clearly indicated by the tissue water K⫹ concentration. The increase
in K⫹ concentration in the late stage is due to water loss.

If the K⫹ supply is in the range of deﬁciency, then the K⫹ concentration in plant tissue is a
reliable indicator of the K⫹ nutritional status. The closer the K⫹ supply approaches to the opti-
mum, the smaller become the diﬀerences in tissue K⫹ concentration between plants grown with

suboptimum and optimum supply. Such an example is shown in Table 4.5 (65). Maximum fruit
yield was obtained in the K2 treatment at K⫹ concentrations in the range of 25 to 35 mg K/g dry
matter (DM). In the K⫹ concentration range of 33 to 42 mg K/g DM, the optimum was surpassed.
The optimum K⫹ concentration range for just fully developed leaves of 25 to 35 mg K/g DM,
as noted for tomatoes, is also noted for fully developed leaves of other crop species, as shown in
Table 4.6 (52). For cereals at the tillering stage, the optimum range is 35 to 45 mg K/g DM. From
Table 4.5, it is evident that stems and ﬂeshy fruits have somewhat lower K⫹ concentrations than
other organs. Also, roots reﬂect the K⫹ nutritional status of plants, and those insuﬃciently supplied
with  K⫹ have  extremely  low  K⫹ concentrations. Young  roots  well  supplied  with  K⫹ have  even
higher K⫹ concentrations in the dry matter than well-supplied leaves (see Table 4.5). The K⫹ con-
centrations for mature kernels of cereals including maize ranges from 4 to 5.5 mg/g, for rape seed
from 7 to 9 mg/g, for sugar beet roots from 1.6 to 9 mg/g, and for potato tubers from 5 to 6 mg/g.

4.5 ASSESSMENT OF POTASSIUM STATUS IN SOILS

4.5.1 POTASSIUM-BEARING MINERALS
The average potassium concentration of the earth’s crust is 23 g/kg. Total potassium concentrations in
the upper soil layer are shown for world soils and several representative soil groups in Table 4.7 (78).
The most important potassium-bearing minerals in soils are alkali feldspars (30 to 20 g K/kg), mus-
covite (K mica, 60 to 90 g K/kg), biotite (Mg mica, 36 to 80 g K/kg), and illite (32 to 56 g K/kg). These
are the main natural potassium sources from which K⫹ is released by weathering and which feed plants.
The basic structural element of feldspars is a tetrahedron forming a Si—Al–O framework in which the
K⫹ is located in the interstices. It is tightly held by covalent bonds (79). The weathering of the mineral
begins at the surface and is associated with the release of K⫹. This process is promoted by very low K⫹
concentrations in the soil solution in contact with the mineral surface, and these low concentrations are

produced by K⫹ uptake by plants and microorganisms and by K⫹ leaching. The micas are phyllosili-
cates (80) and consist of two Si-Al-O tetrahedral sheets between which an M-O-OH octahedral sheet is
located. M stands for Al3⫹, Fe2⫹, Fe3⫹, or Mg2⫹ (81). Because of this 2:1 layer structure, they are also
called 2:1 minerals. These three sheets form a unit layer, and numerous unit layers piled upon each other
form a mineral. These unit layers of mica and illite are bound together by K⫹ (Figure 4.8). K⫹ is located
in hexagonal spaces formed by O atoms, of which the outer electron shell attracts the positively charged
K⫹. During this attraction process, the K⫹ is stripped of its hydration water. This dehydration is a selec-
tive process due to the low hydration energy of K⫹. This action is in contrast to Na⫹, which has a higher
hydration energy than K⫹; the hydrated water molecules are bound more strongly and hence are not
stripped oﬀ, and the hydrated Na⫹ does not ﬁt into the interlayer. The same holds for divalent cations
and cationic aluminum species. This selective K⫹ bond is the main reason why K⫹ in most soils is not
leached easily, in contrast to Na⫹. Ammonium has a similar low hydration energy as K⫹ and can, for
this reason, compete with K⫹ for interlayer binding sites (82,83). This interlayer K⫹ is of utmost impor-
tance for the release and for the storage of K⫹. Equilibrium conditions exist between the K⫹ concen-
tration in the adjacent soil solution and the interlayer K⫹. The equilibrium level diﬀers much between
biotite and muscovite, the former having an equilibrium at about 1 mM and the latter at about 0.1 mM
K⫹ in the soil solution (84). For this reason, the K⫹ of the biotite is much more easily released than the
K⫹ from muscovite, and hence the weathering rate associated with the K⫹ release of biotite is much
higher than that of muscovite. The K⫹ release is induced primarily by a decrease of the K⫹ concentra-
tion in the adjacent solution caused by K⫹ uptake of plant roots, or by K⫹ leaching, or by both processes.
The release of K⫹ begins at the edge positions and proceeds into the inner part of the interlayer. This
release is associated with an opening of the interlayer because the bridging K⫹ is lacking. The free neg-
ative charges of the interlayer are then occupied by hydrated cationic species (Ca2⫹, Mg2⫹, Na⫹, cationic
Al species). From this process, it follows that the interlayer K⫹ is exchangeable. The older literature dis-
tinguishes between p (planar), e (edge), and i (inner) positions of adsorbed (exchangeable) K⫹ accord-
ing to the sites where K⫹ is adsorbed, at the outer surface of the mineral, at the edge of the interlayer,
or  in  the  interlayer.  It  is  more  precise, however, to  distinguish  between  hydrated  and  nonhydrated
adsorbed K⫹ (79), the latter being much more strongly bound than the former. With the exception of the
cationic aluminum species, hydrated cationic species may be replaced quickly by K⫹ originating from
the decomposition of organic matter or inorganic and organic (slurry, farm yard manure) K fertilizer.
The dehydrated K⫹ is adsorbed and contracts the interlayers and is thus ‘ﬁxed.’The process is called K⫹
ﬁxation. Fixation depends much on soil moisture and is restricted by dry (and promoted by moist) soils.
It is generally believed that H⫹ released by roots also contributes much to the release of K⫹ from
K-bearing minerals. This process, however, is hardly feasible since in mineral soils the concentration
of free protons is extremely low and is not reﬂected by the pH because of the very eﬃcient H⫹ buﬀer
systems in mineral soils (85). It is the decrease of the K⫹ concentration in the adjacent solution that
mainly drives the K⫹ release (86,87). Only high H⫹ concentrations (pH ⬍ 3) induce a remarkable
release of K⫹, associated with the decomposition of the mineral (88). A complete removal of the

Academic Publishers, 2001.)

interlayer K⫹ by hydrated cations, including cationic aluminum species, leads to the formation of a
new secondary mineral as shown in Figure 4.8 for the formation of vermiculite from mica (15). In
acid mineral soils characterized by a relatively high concentration of cationic aluminum species, the
aluminum ions may irreversibly occupy the interlayer sites of 2:1 minerals, thus forming a new sec-
ondary mineral called chlorite. By this process, the soil loses its speciﬁc binding sites for K⫹ and
hence the capacity of storing K⫹ in a bioavailable form.

Under humid conditions in geological times, most of the primary minerals of the clay fraction
were converted into secondary minerals because of K⫹ leaching. The process is particularly rele-
vant for small minerals because of their large speciﬁc surface. For this reason, in such soils the clay
fraction contains mainly smectites and vermiculite, which are expanded 2:1 clay minerals. In soils
derived from loess (Luvisol), which are relatively young soils, the most important secondary min-
eral in the clay fraction is the illite, which is presumably derived from muscovite. Its crystalline
structure is not complete, it contains water, and its K⫹ concentration is lower than that of mica (89).
Mica and alkali feldspars present in the silt and sand fraction may considerably contribute to the K⫹
supply of plants (90,91). Although the speciﬁc surface of these primary minerals in the coarser frac-
tions is low, the percentage proportion of the silt and sand fraction in most soils is high and, hence,
also the quantity of potassium-bearing minerals.

Cropping soils without replacing the K⫹ removed from the soil in neutral and alkaline soils
leads to the formation of smectites and in acid soils to the decomposition of 2:1 potassium-bearing
minerals (92). Smectites have a high distance between the unit layers, meaning that there is a broad
interlayer zone occupied mainly by bivalent hydrated cationic species and by adsorbed water mol-
ecules. For this reason, K⫹ is not adsorbed selectively in the interlayers of smectites. The decom-
position  of  K⫹-selective  2:1  minerals  results  also  from  K⫹ leaching.  In  addition, under  humid
conditions, soils become acidic, which promotes the formation of chlorite from K⫹-selective 2:1
minerals. Thus, soils developed under humid conditions have a poor K⫹-selective binding capacity
and are low in potassium, for example, highly weathered tropical soils (Oxisols).

Organic soil matter has no speciﬁc binding sites for K⫹, and therefore its K⫹ is prone to leach-
ing. Soils are generally lower in potassium, and their proportion of organic matter is higher. Soils
with a high content of potassium are young soils, such as many volcanic soils, but also include soils
derived from loess under semiarid conditions.

4.5.2 POTASSIUM FRACTIONS IN SOILS
Fractions of potassium in soil are (a) total potassium, (b) nonexchangeable (but plant-available) potas-
sium, (c) exchangeable potassium, and (d) water-soluble potassium. The total potassium comprises the

CRC_DK2972_Ch004.qxd  6/30/2006  1:55 PM  Page 108

108

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

mineral potassium and potassium in the soil solution and in organic matter. Soil solution potassium
plus organic matter potassium represent only a small portion of the total in mineral soils. The total
potassium  depends  much  on  the  proportion  of  clay  minerals  and  on  the  type  of  clay  minerals.
Kaolinitic clay minerals, having virtually no speciﬁc binding sites for K⫹, have low potassium con-
centrations in contrast to soils rich in 2:1 clay minerals. Mean total K⫹ concentrations, exchange-
able K⫹ concentrations, and water-soluble K⫹ are shown Table 4.8 (93). Soils with mainly kaolinitic
clay minerals have the lowest, and those with smectitic minerals, which include also the 2:1 clay
minerals with interlayer K⫹, have the highest potassium concentration. The K⫹ concentration of the
group of mixed clay minerals, kaolinitic and 2:1 clay minerals, is intermediate. Water-soluble K⫹
depends on the clay concentration in soils and on the type of clay minerals. As can be seen from
Figure 4.9, the index of soluble K⫹ decreases linearly with an increase in the clay concentration in
soils and the level of soluble K⫹ in the kaolinitic soil group is much higher than that of the mixed
soil group and of the smectitic soil group (94).

The determination of total soil potassium requires a dissolution of potassium-bearing soil min-
erals. The digestion is carried out in platinum crucibles with a mixture of hydroﬂuoric acid, sulfu-
ric  acid, perchloric  acid, hydrochloric  acid, and  nitric  acid  (95).  Of  particular  importance  in  the
available soil potassium is the exchangeable K⫹, which is obtained by extracting the soil sample
with a 1 M NH4Cl or a 1 M NH4 acetate solution (96). With this extraction, the adsorbed hydrated
K⫹ and  some  of  the  nonhydrated  K⫹ (K⫹ at  edge  positions)  is  obtained.  In  arable  soils, the
exchangeable  K⫹ ranges  between  40  to  400 mg  K/kg.  Soil  extraction  with  CaCl2 solutions
(125 mM) extracts somewhat lower quantities of K⫹ as the Ca2⫹ cannot exchange the nonhydrated
K⫹, in contrast to NH4
⫹-containing extraction solutions. For the determination of the
nonexchangeable K⫹, not obtained by the exchange with NH4
⫹ and consisting of mainly interlayer
K⫹ and structural K⫹ of the potassium feldspars, diluted acids such as 10 mM HCl (97) or 10 mM
HNO3 are used (98). These extractions have the disadvantage in that they extract a K⫹ quantity and
do not assess a release rate, the latter being of higher importance for the availability of K⫹ to plants.
The release of K⫹ from the interlayers is a ﬁrst-order reaction (83) and is described by the fol-

⫹ of the NH4

lowing equations (99):

(cid:127) Elovich function: y⫽ a⫹ b ln t
(cid:127) Exponential function: ln  y⫽ ln a⫹ b ln t
(cid:127) Parabolic di ﬀusion function: y⫽ b t1/2

where y is the quantity of extracted K⫹, a the intercept on the Y-axis, and b the slope of the curve.
In this investigation, soils were extracted repeatedly by Ca2⫹-saturated ion exchangers for long
periods (maximum time 7000 h). Analogous results are obtained with electro-ultra-ﬁltration (EUF), in
which K⫹ is extracted from a soil suspension in an electrical  ﬁeld (100). There are two successive
extractions; the ﬁrst with 200 V and at 20⬚C (ﬁrst fraction) and a following extraction (second fraction)

solution, whereas the second fraction contains the interlayer K⫹. The extraction curves are shown for
four diﬀerent soils in Figure 4.10, from which it is clear that the K⫹ release of the second fraction is a
ﬁrst-order reaction (101). The curves ﬁt the ﬁrst-order equation, the Elovich function, the parabolic
diﬀusion function, and the power function, with the Elovich function having the best ﬁt with R2 ⬎ 0.99.

4.5.3 PLANT-AVAILABLE POTASSIUM
Several decades ago it was assumed that the ‘activity ratio’ between the K⫹ activity and the Ca2⫹
plus Mg2⫹ activities in the soil solution would describe the K⫹ availability in soils according to the
equation (102)

AR ⫽ K⫹/兹(Ca2⫹ Mg2⫹)

In diluted solutions such as the soil solution, the K⫹ activity is approximately the K⫹ concen-
tration. It was found that this activity ratio does not reﬂect the K⫹ availability for plants (103). Of
utmost importance for the K⫹ availability is the K⫹ concentration in the soil solution. The formula
of the AR gives only the ratio and not the K⫹ activity or the K⫹ concentration. The K⫹ ﬂux in soils
depends on the diﬀusibility in the medium, which means it is strongly dependent on soil moisture
and on the K⫹ concentration in the soil solution, as shown in the following formula (104):

J ⫽ D1 (dc1/dx) ⫹D2(dc2/dx) ⫹c3v;

where J is the K⫹ ﬂux toward root surface, D1 the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the soil solution, c1 the
K⫹ concentration in the soil solution, D2 the diﬀusion coeﬃcient at interlayer surfaces, c2 the K⫹
concentration at the interlayer surface, x the distance, dc/dx the concentration gradient, c3 the K⫹
concentration in the mass ﬂow water, and v the volume of the mass ﬂow water.

K. Uhlenbecker, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 57:761–766, 1993.)

The hydrated K⫹ adsorbed to the surfaces of the clay minerals can be desorbed quickly accord-
ing to the equilibrium conditions, in contrast to the nonhydrated K⫹ of the interlayer, which has to
diﬀuse to the edges of the interlayer. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient of K⫹ in the interlayer is in the range
of 10⫺13 m2/s, whereas the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of K⫹ in the soil solution is about 10⫺9 m2/s (105).
The distances in the interlayers, however, are relatively short, and the K⫹ concentrations are high.
Therefore, appreciable amounts of K⫹ can be released by the interlayers. The K⫹ that is directly
available is that of the soil solution, which may diﬀuse or be moved by mass ﬂow to the root surface
according to the equation shown above.

Growing roots represent a strong sink for K⫹ because of K⫹ uptake. Generally the K⫹ uptake
rate is higher than the K⫹ diﬀusion, and thus a K⫹ depletion proﬁle is produced with lowest K⫹
concentration at the root surface (106), as shown in Figure 4.11. This K⫹ concentration may be as
low as 0.10 µM, whereas in the equilibrated soil solution K⫹, concentrations in the range of 500
µM prevail. Figure 4.11 shows such a depletion proﬁle for exchangeable K⫹. From this ﬁgure it is
also clear that higher the value of dc/dx the higher the level of exchangeable K⫹ (106). The K⫹
concentration at the root surface is decisive for the rate of K⫹ uptake according to the following
equation (107):

Q⫽ 2πaαct

where Q is the quantity of K⫹ absorbed per cm root length, a the root radius in cm, ♡ the K⫹-absorb-
ing power of the root, c the K⫹ concentration at the root surface, and t the time of nutrient absorption.
The K⫹-absorbing power of roots depends on the K⫹ nutritional status of roots; plants well sup-
plied with K⫹ have a low absorbing power and vice versa. In addition, absorbing power depends also
on the energy status of the root, and a low-energy status may even lead to K⫹ release by roots (19). The
K⫹ concentration at the root surface also depends on the K⫹ buﬀer power of soils, which basically
means  the  amount  of  adsorbed  K⫹ that  is  in  an  equilibrated  condition  with  the  K⫹ in  solution.
The K⫹ buﬀer power is reﬂected by the plot of adsorbed K⫹ on the K⫹ concentration of the equilibrated
soil solution, as shown in Figure 4.12. This relationship is known as the Quantity/Intensity relationship.

the intensity represents the K⫹ concentration in the equilibrated soil solution. As can be seen from
Figure 4.12, the quantity per unit intensity is much higher for one soil than the other, and the ‘high’ soil
has  a  higher  potential  to  maintain  the  K⫹ concentration  at  the  root  surface  at  a  high  level  than  the
‘medium’ soil.

4.5.4 SOIL TESTS FOR POTASSIUM FERTILIZER RECOMMENDATIONS
The most common test for available K⫹ is the exchangeable K⫹ obtained by extraction with 1 M
NH4Cl or NH4 acetate. This fraction contains mainly soil solution K⫹ plus K⫹ of the hydrated K⫹
fraction and only a small part of the interlayer K⫹. Exchangeable K⫹ ranges between 40 and about
400 mg/kg soil and even more. Concentrations of  ⬍100 mg K/kg are frequently in the deﬁciency
range; concentrations between 100 and 250 mg K/kg soil are in the range of suﬃciently to well-sup-
plied soils. Since one cannot distinguish between interlayer K⫹ and K⫹ from the hydrated fraction,
this  test  gives  no  information  about  the  contribution  of  interlayer  K⫹.  The  interpretation  of  the
exchangeable soil test data therefore requires some information about further soil parameters, such
as clay concentration and type of clay minerals. But even if these are known, it is not clear to what
degree the interlayer K⫹ is exhausted and to what degree mica of the silt fraction contributes sub-
stantially to the crop supply (90). Available K⫹ is determined also by extraction with 1 mM HCl, by
which the exchangeable K⫹ and some of the interlayer K⫹ are removed. Furthermore, with this tech-
nique the contribution of the interlayer K⫹ also is not determined. The same is true for soil extrac-
tion with a mixture of 0.25 mM Ca lactate and HCl at a pH of 3.6 (108). Quantities of K⫹ extracted
with  this  technique  are  generally  somewhat  lower  than  the  quantities  of  the  exchangeable  K⫹

fraction. With the EUF technique, a diﬀerentiation between the nonhydrated exchangeable K⫹ and
the interlayer K⫹ is possible, as shown in Figure 4.10. In the EUF, routine analysis extraction of the
adsorbed hydrated K⫹ lasts 30 minutes (200 V, 20°C); for the second fraction (400 V, 80°C), the soil
suspension is extracted for only 5 minutes. The K⫹ extracted during this 5-minute period is a reli-
able indicator of the availability of interlayer K⫹ and is taken into consideration for the recommen-
dation of the potassium fertilization rates. This EUF technique is nowadays used on a broad scale in
Germany and Austria with much success for the recommendation of K fertilizer rates, particularly to
crops such as sugar beet (109). With the EUF extraction procedure, not only are values for available
K⫹ obtained but the availability of other plant nutrients such as inorganic and organic nitrogen, phos-
phorus, magnesium, calcium, and micronutrients are also determined in one soil sample.

4.6 POTASSIUM FERTILIZERS

4.6.1 KINDS OF FERTILIZERS
The most important potassium fertilizers are shown in Table 4.9 (15). Two major groups may be
distinguished, the chlorides and the sulfates. The latter are more expensive than the chlorides. For
this  reason, the  chlorides  are  preferred, provided  that  the  crop  is  not  chlorophobic.  Most  ﬁeld
crops  are  not  sensitive  to  chloride  and  should  therefore  be  fertilized  with  potassium  chloride
(muriate of potash). Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) and coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) have a
speciﬁc  chloride  requirement, with  Cl⫺ functioning  as  a  kind  of  plant  nutrient  because  of  its
osmotic  eﬀect  (110).  Potassium  nitrate  is  used  almost  exclusively  as  foliar  spray.  Potassium
metaphosphate  and  potassium  silicate  have  a  low  solubility  and  are  used  preferentially  in
artiﬁcial substrates with a low K⫹-binding potential to avoid too high K⫹ concentrations in the
vicinity of the roots. Potassium silicates produced from ash and dolomite have a low solubility,
but solubility is still high enough in ﬂooded soils to feed a rice crop (111). The silicate has an
additional positive eﬀect on rice culm stability. Sulfate-containing potassium fertilizers should be
applied in cases where the sulfur supply is insuﬃcient; magnesium-containing potassium fertil-
izers are used on soils low in available magnesium. Such soils are mainly sandy soils with a low
cation exchange capacity.

4.6.2 APPLICATION OF POTASSIUM FERTILIZERS
Chlorophobic  crop  species  should  not  be  fertilized  with  potassium  chloride.  Such  species  are
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), grape (Vitis vinifera L.), fruit trees, cotton, sugarcane (Saccharum
oﬃcinarum L.), potato, tomato, strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne), cucumber (Cucumis
sativus L.), and onion (Allium cepa L.). These crops should be fertilized with potassium sulfate. If
potassium chloride is applied, it should be applied in autumn on soils that contain suﬃciently high
concentrations of K⫹-selective binding sites in the rooting zone. In such a case, the chloride may be
leached by winter rainfall, whereas the K⫹ is adsorbed to 2:1 minerals and hence is available to the
crop  in  the  following  season.  On  soils  with  a  medium  to  high  cation  exchange  capacity
(CEC ⬎ 120 mgmol/kg)  and  with  2:1  selective  K⫹-binding  minerals, potassium  fertilizers  can  be
applied in all seasons around the year since there is no danger of K⫹ leaching out of the rooting
proﬁle (Alﬁsols, Inceptisols, Vertisols, and Mollisols, in contrast to Ultisols, Oxisols, Spodosols,
and  Histosols).  In  the  latter  soils, high  K⫹ leaching  occurs  during  winter  or  monsoon  rainfall.
Histosols may have a high CEC on a weight basis but not on a volume basis because of their high
organic matter content. In addition, Histosols contain few K⫹-selective binding sites. Under tropi-
cal conditions on highly weathered soils (Oxisols, Ultisols), potassium fertilizer may be applied in
several small doses during vegetative growth in order to avoid major K⫹ leaching.

The quantities of fertilizer potassium required depend on the status of available K⫹ in the soil
and on the crop species, including its yield level. Provided that the status of available K⫹ in the soil
is suﬃcient, the potassium fertilizer rate should be at least as high as the quantity of potassium pres-
ent in the crop parts removed from the ﬁeld, which in many case are grains, seeds, tubers, roots or
fruits. In Table 4.10 (15), the approximate concentrations of potassium in plant parts are shown. It
is  evident  that  the  potassium  concentrations  in  cereal  grains  are  low  compared  with  leguminous
seeds, sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.) and rape seed. Potassium removal by fruit trees is shown
in Table 4.11. The concept of assessing fertilizer rates derived from potassium removal is correct
provided that no major leaching losses occur during rainy seasons. In such cases, the K⫹ originat-
ing from leaves and straw remaining on the ﬁeld may be leached into the subsoil at high rates. Such
losses by leaching are the case for Spodosols, Oxisols, and Ultisols. Here, besides the K⫹ removed
from the soil by crop plants, the leached K⫹ must also be taken into consideration. On the other
hand, if a soil has a high status of available K⫹, one or even several potassium fertilizer applications
per crop species in the rotation may be omitted. As a ﬁrst approach for calculating the amount of
available K⫹ in the soil, 1 mg/kg soil of exchangeable K⫹ equals approximately 5 kg K/ha. In this
calculation, interlayer K⫹ is not taken into consideration. If the soil is low in available K⫹, for most
soils higher fertilization rates are required than 5 kg K/ha per mg exchangeable K⫹, since with the

exception of Histosols and Spodosols, sites of interlayer positions must be ﬁlled up by K⫹ before
the exchangeable K⫹ will be raised. This problem is particularly acute on K⫹-ﬁxing soils. Here,
high K fertilizer rates are required, as shown in Table 4.12 (112). From the discussion, it is clear
that with normal potassium fertilizer rates, the yield and the potassium concentration in leaves were
hardly raised and optimum yield and leaf potassium concentrations were attained with application
of 1580 kg K/ha. As soon as the K⫹-ﬁxing binding sites are saturated by K⫹, fertilizer should be
applied at a rate in the range of the K⫹ accumulation by the crop.

Plant  species  diﬀer  in  their  capability  for  exploiting  soil  K⫹.  There  is  a  major  diﬀerence
between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species, the latter being less capable of exploiting

soil K⫹, mainly interlayer K⫹, than the former. In a 20-year ﬁeld trial on an arable soil derived
from loess (Alﬁsol), the treatment without potassium fertilizer produced cereal yields that were not
much lower than those in the fertilized treatment, in contrast to the yields of potatoes, faba beans
(Vicia faba L.), and a clover-grass mixture. With these crops, the relative yields were 73, 52, and
84, respectively, with  a  yield  of  100  in  the  potassium-fertilized  treatment  (113).  This  diﬀerent
behavior is particularly true for grasses and leguminous species. Root investigations under ﬁeld
conditions with perennial ryegrass and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cultivated on an Alﬁsol
showed considerable diﬀerences in root morphology, including root hairs and root length, which
were much longer for the grass (114). Hence the root–soil contact is much greater for the grass
than for the clover. The grass will therefore still feed suﬃciently from the low soil solution K⫹
concentration  originating  from  interlayer  K⫹, a  concentration  that  is  insuﬃcient  for  the  clover.
From this result, it follows that leguminous species in a mixed crop stand, including swards of
meadow and pasture, will withstand the competition with grasses only if the soil is well supplied
with available K⫹.

This diﬀerence between monocots and dicots in exploiting soil K⫹ implies that grasses can be
grown satisfactorily on a lower level of exchangeable soil K⫹ than dicots. It should be taken into
consideration, however, that a major depletion of interlayer K⫹ leads to a loss of selective K⫹-bind-
ing sites because of the conversion or destruction of soil minerals (92), giving an irreversible loss
of an essential soil fertility component.

Table 4.12 shows that the optimum K⫹ supply considerably decreases the percentage of crop
lodging. This action is an additional positive eﬀect of K⫹, which is also true with other cereal
crops. As already considered above, K⫹ favors the energy status of plants and thus the synthe-
sis  of  various  biochemical  compounds  such  as  cellulose, lignin, vitamins, and  lipids.  In  this
respect, the synthesis of leaf cuticles is of particular interest (15). Poorly developed cuticles and
also thin cell walls favor penetration and infection by fungi and lower the resistance to diseases
(115).

Heavy potassium fertilizer rates also may depress the negative eﬀect of salinity since the exces-
sive uptake of Na⫹ into the plant cell is depressed by K⫹. Table 4.13 presents such an example for
mandarin oranges (Citrus reticulata Blanco) (116), showing that the depressive eﬀect of salinity on
leaf area was counterbalanced by higher potassium fertilizer rates. The higher the relative K⫹ eﬀect,
the higher is the salinity level.

5.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION

5.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
The rare earth element calcium is one of the most abundant elements in the lithosphere; it is read-
ily available in most soils; and it is a macronutrient for plants, yet it is actively excluded from plant
cytoplasm.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

In 1804, de Saussure showed that a component of plant tissues comes from the soil, not the air,
but it was considerably later that the main plant nutrients were identiﬁed. Liebig was the ﬁrst per-
son to be associated strongly with the idea that there are essential elements taken up from the soil
(in 1840), although Sprengel was the ﬁrst person to identify calcium as a macronutrient in 1828 (1).
Calcium was one of the 20 essential elements that Sprengel identiﬁed.

Salm-Horstmar grew oats (Avena sativa L.) in inert media with diﬀerent elements supplied as
solutions in 1849 and 1851 and showed that omitting calcium had an adverse eﬀect on growth (2).
However, it  was  the  discovery  that  plants  could  be  grown  in  hydroponic  culture  by  Sachs  (and
almost simultaneously Knop) in 1860 that made investigation of what elements are essential for
plant growth much easier (2). Sachs’ ﬁrst usable nutrient solution contained CaSO4 and CaHPO4.
It has been well known since the early part of the twentieth century that there is a very distinct ﬂora
in  areas  of  calcareous  soils, comprised  of  so-called  calcicole  species.  There  are  equally  distinctive
groups of plant species that are not found on calcareous soils, the calcifuge species (see Section 5.3.2.3).

5.2 FUNCTIONS IN PLANTS
Calcium has several distinct functions within higher plants. Bangerth (3) suggested that these func-
tions  can  be  divided  into  four  main  areas: (a)  eﬀects  on  membranes, (b)  eﬀects  on  enzymes,
(c) eﬀects on cell walls, and (d) interactions of calcium with phytohormones, although the eﬀects
on enzymes and the interactions with phytohormones may be the same activity. As a divalent ion,
calcium is not only able to form intramolecular complexes, but it is also able to link molecules in
intermolecular complexes (4), which seems to be crucial to its function.

5.2.1 EFFECTS ON MEMBRANES
Epstein established that membranes become leaky when plants are grown in the absence of calcium
(5) and that ion selectivity is lost. Calcium ions (Ca2⫹) bridge phosphate and carboxylate groups of
phospholipids  and  proteins  at  membrane  surfaces  (6), helping  to  maintain  membrane  structure.
Also, some  eﬀect  occurs  in  the  middle  of  the  membrane, possibly  through  interaction  of  the 
calcium  and  proteins  that  are  an  integral  part  of  membranes  (6,7).  Possibly, calcium  may  link 
adjacent phosphatidyl-serine head groups, binding the phospholipids together in certain areas that
are then more rigid than the surrounding areas (8).

5.2.2 ROLE IN CELL WALLS
Calcium is a key element in the structure of primary cell walls. In the primary cell wall, cellulose
microﬁbrils  are  linked  together  by  cross-linking  glycans, usually  xyloglucan  (XG)  polymers  but
also  glucoarabinoxylans  in  Poaceae  (Gramineae)  and  other  monocots  (9).  These  interlocked
microﬁbrils are embedded in a matrix, in which pectin is the most abundant class of macromole-
cule. Pectin is also abundant in the middle lamellae between cells.

Pectin  consists  of  rhamnogalacturonan  (RG)  and  homogalacturonan  (HG)  domains. The  HG
domains are a linear polymer of (1→4)-α⬘-linked D-galacturonic acid, 100 to 200 residues long, and
are deposited in the cell wall with 70 to 80% of the galacturonic acid residues methyl-esteriﬁed at
the C6 position (9). The methyl-ester groups are removed by pectin methylesterases, allowing cal-
cium ions to bind to the negative charges thus exposed and to form inter-polymer bridges that
hold the backbones together (9). The whole structure can be thought of as resembling an eggbox
(Figure 5.1).

Pectin  is  a  highly  hydrated  gel  containing  pores;  the  smaller  the  size  of  these  pores, the
higher the Ca2⫹ concentration in the matrix and more cross-linking of chains occurs (11). This
gel holds the XG molecules in position relative to each other, and these molecules in turn hold
the  cellulose  microﬁbrils  together  (Figure  5.2).  The  presence  of  the  calcium, therefore, gives

Carpita and D.M. Gibeaut, Plant J. 3:1–30, 1993.) To the right of the ﬁgure, Ca2⫹ ions have been displaced
from the HG domains by H⫹ ions, so that the pectin is no longer such an adhesive gel and slippage of the bonds
between adjacent XG chains occurs and expansin is able to work on them. This loosens the structure and allows
the cellulose microﬁbrils to be pushed further apart by cell turgor.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

some load-bearing strength to the cell wall (13). It is suggested that when a primary cell wall is
expanding, localized accumulation of H⫹ ions may displace Ca2⫹ from the HG domains, thereby
lowering the extent to which the pectin holds the XG strands together (11). In a root-tip cell,
where the cellulose microﬁbrils are oriented transversely, slippage of the XG chains allows the
cellulose microﬁbrils to move further apart from each other, giving cell expansion in a longitu-
dinal direction.

Cell-to-cell adhesion may also be given by Ca2⫹ cross-linking between HG domains in the
cell walls of adjacent cells, but this action is less certain as experimental removal of Ca2⫹ leads
to cell separation in a only few cases (9). In the ripening of fruits, a loosening of the cells could
possibly  occur  with  loss  of  calcium.  It  has  been  postulated  that  decrease  in  apoplastic  pH  in
ripening pome fruits may cause the release of Ca2⫹ ions from the pectin, allowing for its solubi-
lization (14). However, in an experiment on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), the decline
in apoplastic pH that occurred was not matched by a noticeable decrease in apoplastic Ca2⫹ con-
centration, and the concentration of the ion remained high enough to limit the solubilization of
the pectin (15). It certainly seems that calcium inhibits the degradation of the pectates in the cell
wall by inhibiting the formation of polygalacturonases (16), so the element has roles in possibly
holding the pectic components together and in inhibiting the enzymes of their degradation. In a
study on a ripening and a nonripening cultivar of tomato (Rutgers and rin, respectively), there
was an increase in calcium concentration after anthesis in the rin cultivar, whereas in the Rutgers
cultivar there was a noticeable fall in the concentration of bound calcium and an increase in poly-
galacturonase activity (17). In a study on calcium deﬁciency in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.),
deﬁcient plants had more than double the activity of polygalacturonase compared with normal
plants (18).

5.2.3 EFFECTS ON ENZYMES
Unlike K⫹ and Mg2⫹, Ca2⫹ does not activate many enzymes (19), and its concentration in the cyto-
plasm is kept low. This calcium homeostasis is achieved by the action of membrane-bound, cal-
cium-dependent ATPases that actively pump Ca2⫹ ions from the cytoplasm and into the vacuoles,
the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER), and  the  mitochondria  (20). This  process  prevents  the  ion  from
competing with Mg2⫹, thereby lowering activity of some enzymes; the action prevents Ca2⫹ from
inhibiting cytoplasmic or chloroplastic enzymes such as phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase
(21) and prevents Ca2⫹ from precipitating inorganic phosphate (22).

Calcium can be released from storage, particularly in the vacuole, into the cytoplasm. Such ﬂux
is  fast  (23)  as  it  occurs  by  means  of  channels  from  millimolar  concentrations  in  the  vacuole  to
nanomolar concentrations in the cytoplasm of resting cells (24). The calcium could inhibit cyto-
plasmic enzymes directly, or by competition with Mg2⫹. Calcium can also react with the calcium-
binding protein calmodulin (CaM). Up to four Ca2⫹ ions may reversibly bind to each molecule of
calmodulin, and this binding exposes two hydrophobic areas on the protein that enables it to bind
to  hydrophobic  regions  on  a  large  number  of  key  enzymes  and  to  activate  them  (25).  The
Ca2⫹–calmodulin complex also may stimulate the activity of the calcium-dependent ATPases (26),
thus removing the calcium from the cytoplasm again and priming the whole system for further stim-
ulation if calcium concentrations in the cytoplasm rise again.

Other  sensors  of  calcium  concentration  are  in  the  cytoplasm, for  example, Ca2⫹-dependent
(CaM-independent)  protein  kinases  (25). The  rapid  increases  in  cytoplasmic  Ca2⫹ concentration
that occur when the channels open and let calcium out of the vacuolar store and the magnitude,
duration, and precise location of these increases give a series of calcium signatures that are part of
the responses of a plant to a range of environmental signals. These responses enable the plant to
respond to drought, salinity, cold shock, mechanical stress, ozone and blue light, ultraviolet radia-
tion, and other stresses (24).

5.2.4 INTERACTIONS WITH PHYTOHORMONES
An involvement of calcium in the actions of phytohormones seems likely as root growth ceases
within  only  a  few  hours  of  the  removal  of  calcium  from  a  nutrient  solution  (22).  The  element
appears  to  be  involved  in  cell  division  and  in  cell  elongation  (27)  and  is  linked  to  the  action  of 
auxins. The loosening of cellulose microﬁbrils in the cell wall is controlled by auxins, giving rise
to excretion of protons into the cell wall. Calcium is involved in this process, as discussed earlier.
Furthermore, auxin  is  involved  in  calcium  transport  in  plants, and  treatment  of  plants  with  the
indoleacetic acid (IAA) transport inhibitor, 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), results in restricted
calcium transport into the treated tissue (28). As the relationship is a two-way process, it cannot be
conﬁrmed easily if calcium is required for the action of IAA or if the action of IAA gives rise to
cell growth, and consequent cell wall development, with the extra pectic material in the cell wall
then acting as a sink for calcium. It is also possible that IAA inﬂuences the development of xylem
in the treated tissue (29).

Increase in shoot concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) following imposition of water-deﬁcit
stress leads to increased cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2⫹ in guard cells, an increase that precedes
stomatal  closure  (24).  Further  evidence  for  an  involvement  of  calcium  with  phytohormones  has
come from the observation that senescence in maize (Zea mays L.) leaves can be slowed by sup-
plying either Ca2⫹ or cytokinin, with the eﬀects being additive (30). There is also a relationship
between  membrane  permeability, which  is  strongly  aﬀected  by  calcium  content  and  ethylene
biosynthesis in fruit ripening (31).

5.2.5 OTHER EFFECTS
It has been known for a long time that calcium is essential for the growth of pollen tubes. A gradi-
ent of cytoplasmic calcium concentration occurs along the pollen tube, with the highest concentra-
tions being found in the tip. The fastest rate of inﬂux of calcium occurs at the tip, up to 20 pmol
cm⫺2 s⫺1, but there are oscillations in the rate of pollen tube growth and calcium inﬂux that are
approximately in step (32). It seems probable that the calcium exerts an inﬂuence on the growth of
the pollen tube mediated by calmodulin and calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (25), but the
growth and the inﬂux of calcium are not directly linked as the peaks in oscillation of growth pre-
cede the peaks in uptake of calcium by 4 s (32). Root hairs have a high concentration of Ca2⫹, and
root hair growth has a similar calcium signature to pollen tube growth (24). Slight increases in cyto-
plasmic Ca2⫹ concentration can close the plasmodesmata in seconds, with the calcium itself and
calmodulin  being  implicated  (33).  Many  sinks, such  as  root  apices, require  symplastic  phloem
unloading through sink plasmodesmata, so this action implies that calcium has a role as a messen-
ger in the growth of many organs.

It seems that calcium can be replaced by strontium in maize to a certain extent (34), but despite
the similarities in the properties of the two elements, this substitution does not appear to be com-
mon to many plant species. In general, the presence of abundant calcium in the soil prevents much
uptake of strontium, and in a study on 10 pasture species, the concentration of strontium in the shoot
was correlated negatively with the concentration of calcium in the soil (35).

5.3 DIAGNOSIS OF CALCIUM STATUS IN PLANTS

5.3.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY AND EXCESS
Plants  deﬁcient  in  calcium  typically  have  upper  parts  of  the  shoot  that  are  yellow-green  and
lower parts that are dark green (36) (Figure 5.3). Given the abundance of calcium in soil, such
a condition is unusual, although it can arise from incorrect formulation of fertilizers or nutrient
solutions.

but the lamina of the older, emerged leaf behind is green. (Photograph by Allen V. Barker.) (For a color pres-
entation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

However, despite the abundance of calcium, plants suﬀer from a range of calcium-deﬁciency
disorders that aﬀect tissues or organs that are naturally low in calcium. These include blossom-
end rot (BER) of tomato (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and water
melon (Cucumis melo L.) fruits, bitter pit of apple (Malus pumila Mill.), black heart of celery
(Apium graveolens L.), internal rust spot in potato tubers and carrot (Daucus carota L.) roots,
internal  browning  of  Brussels  sprouts  (Brassica  oleracea L.), internal  browning  of  pineapple
(Ananas comosus Merr.), and tip burn of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and strawberries (Fragaria x
ananassa Duch.) (22,37,38). Recently, it has been suggested that the disorder ‘crease’ in navel
and Valencia oranges (Citrus aurantium L.) may be caused by calcium deﬁciency in the albedo
tissue of the rind (39).

In these disorders, the shortage of calcium in the tissues causes a general collapse of membrane
and cell wall structure, allowing leakage of phenolic precursors into the cytoplasm. Oxidation of
polyphenols within the aﬀected tissues gives rise to melanin compounds and necrosis (40). With the
general  breakdown  of  cell  walls  and  membranes, microbial  infection  is  frequently  a  secondary
eﬀect. In the case of crease, calcium deﬁciency may give less adhesion between the cells of the rind,
as the middle lamella of these cells is composed largely of calcium salts of pectic acid (39).

Local excess of calcium in the fruit gives rise to goldspot in tomatoes, a disorder that mostly
occurs late in the season and that is pronounced with high temperature (41). The disorder ‘peteca’

that gives rise to brown spots on the rind of lemons (Citrus limon Burm. f.) is associated with local-
ized high concentrations of calcium (as calcium oxalate crystals) and depressed concentrations of
boron, although this phenomenon has not yet been shown to be the cause of the disorder (42).

Given the suggestion that calcium may be involved in cell-to-cell adhesion and in the ripening
of fruit, it is hardly surprising that in pome fruits, ﬁrmness of the fruit is correlated positively with
the concentration of calcium present (43). However, this relationship is by no means straightfor-
ward; in a study of Cox’s Orange Pippin apples grown in two orchards in the United Kingdom, there
were lower concentrations of cell wall calcium in the fruit from the orchard that regularly produced
ﬁrmer fruits than in fruits from other orchards (44). The fruits from this orchard contained higher
concentrations of cell wall nitrogen.

Other studies have shown no relationship between calcium concentration in apples at harvest
and their ﬁrmness after storage, but it is deﬁnitely the case that fruit with low Ca2⫹ concentrations
are more at risk of developing bitter pit while in storage (45).

5.3.2 CONCENTRATIONS OF CALCIUM IN PLANTS

5.3.2.1 Forms of Calcium Compounds
Within  plants, calcium  is  present  as  Ca2⫹ ions  attached  to  carboxyl  groups  on  cell  walls  by
cation-exchange reactions. As approximately one third of the macromolecules in the primary cell
wall are pectin (9), it can be seen that a large proportion occurs as calcium pectate. Pectin may
also join with anions, such as vanadate, and serve to detoxify these ions. The Ca2⫹ cation will
also join with the organic anions formed during the assimilation of nitrate in leaves; these anions
carry the negative charge that is released as nitrate is converted into ammonium (46). Thus, there
will be formation of calcium malate and calcium oxalacetate and, also very commonly, calcium
oxalate in cells.

Calcium oxalate can occur within cells and as extracellular deposits. In a study of 46 conifer
species, all contained calcium oxalate crystals (47). All of the species in the Pinaceae family accu-
mulated the compound in crystalliferous parenchyma cells, but the species not in the Pinaceae fam-
ily had the compound present in extracellular crystals.

This accumulation of calcium oxalate is common in plants in most families. Up to 90% of total
calcium in individual plants is in this form (48,49). Formation of calcium oxalate crystals occurs
in specialized cells, crystal idioblasts, and as the calcium oxalate in these cells is osmotically inac-
tive their formation serves to lower the concentration of calcium in the apoplast of surrounding
cells without aﬀecting the osmotic balance of the tissue (48). A variety of diﬀerent forms of the
crystals occur (49), and they can be composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate or calcium oxalate
dihydrate (50).

5.3.2.2 Distribution of Calcium in Plants
Calcium moves toward roots by diﬀusion and mass ﬂow (51,52) in the soil. A number of calcium-
speciﬁc ion channels occur in the membranes of root cells, through which inﬂux occurs, but these
channels appear to be more involved in enabling rapid  ﬂuxes of calcium into the cytoplasm and
organelles as part of signalling mechanisms (53). This calcium is then moved into vacuoles, endo-
plasmic  reticulum, or  other  organelles, with  movement  occurring  by  means  of  calcium-speciﬁc
transporters (20).

The bulk entry of calcium into roots occurs initially into the cell walls and in the intercellular
spaces of the roots, giving a continuum between calcium in the soil and calcium in the root (54).
For  calcium  to  move  from  the  roots  to  the  rest  of  the  plant, it  has  to  enter  the  xylem, but  the
Casparian band of the endodermis is an eﬀective barrier to its movement into the xylem apoplasti-
cally. However, when endodermis is ﬁrst formed, the Casparian band is a cellulosic strip that passes
round the radial cell wall (state I endodermis), so calcium is able to pass into the xylem if it passes
into the endodermal cells from the cortex and then out again into the pericycle, through the plas-
malemma abutting the wall (55). This transport seems to occur, with the calcium moving into the
endodermal cells (and hence into the symplasm) through ion channels and from the endodermis into
the pericycle (and ultimately into the much higher concentration of calcium already present in the
xylem) by transporters (56,57). Highly developed endodermis has suberin lamellae laid down inside
the cell wall around the entire cell (state II endodermis), and in the oldest parts of the root, there is
a  further  layer  of  cellulose  inside  this  (state  III)  (55). Although  some  ions  such  as  K⫹ can  pass
through state II endodermal cells, Ca2⫹ cannot. There are plasmodesmata between endodermis and
pericycle cells, even where the Casparian band is well developed, but although phosphate and K⫹
ions can pass, the plasmodesmata are impermeable to Ca2⫹ ions.

This restriction in eﬀect limits the movement of calcium into the stele to the youngest part of
the root, where the endodermis is in state I. Some movement occurs into the xylem in older parts
of the root, and this transport can occur by two means. It is suggested that movement of calcium
through state III endodermis might occur where it is penetrated by developing lateral roots, but the
Casparian band rapidly develops here to form a complete network around the endodermal cells of
the main and lateral roots (55). The second site of movement of calcium into the stele is through
passage cells (55). During the development of state II and state III endodermis some cells remain
in state I. These are passage cells. They tend to be adjacent to the poles of protoxylem in the stele,
and they are the site of calcium movement from cortex to pericycle.

In some herbaceous plants (e.g., wheat, barley, oats), the epidermis and cortex are lost from the
roots, especially in drought, so the passage cells are the only position where the symplast is in con-
tact with the rhizosphere (55). Most angiosperms form an exodermis immediately inside the epi-
dermis, and the cells of this tissue also develop Casparian bands and suberin lamellae, with passage
cells  in  some  places  (55). These  passage  cells  are  similarly  the  only  place  where  the  symplasm
comes in contact with the rhizosphere.

Because of this restricted entry into roots, calcium enters mainly just behind the tips, and it is
mostly here that it is loaded into the xylem (Figure 5.6). Absorption of calcium into the roots may be
passive and dependent on root cation-exchange capacity (CEC) (58). Transfer of calcium into roots
is hardly aﬀected by respiratory uncouplers, although its transfer into the xylem is aﬀected (54,59).
Once in the xylem the calcium moves in the transpiration stream, and movement around the
plant is restricted almost entirely to the xylem (60,61) as it is present in the phloem only at simi-
larly low concentrations to those that occur in the cytoplasm.

As calcium is not mobile in the phloem, it cannot be retranslocated from old shoot tissues to
young tissues, and its xylem transport into organs that do not have a high transpiration rate (such as
fruits) is low (22). Its ﬂux into leaves also declines after maturity, even though the rate of transpi-
ration by the leaf remains constant (62), and this response could be related to a decline in nitrate
reductase activity as new leaves in the plant take over a more signiﬁcant assimilatory role (22,63).
When a general deﬁciency of calcium occurs in plants, because of the low mobility of calcium in
phloem, it is the new leaves that are aﬀected, not the old leaves, as calcium in a plant remains pre-
dominantly in the old tissues (Figure 5.7).

Calcium

It was long thought that a direct connection occurs between the amount of transpiration that a plant
carries out and the amount of Ca2⫹ that it accumulates. For example, in a study of ﬁve tomato cultivars
grown at two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) there was a linear, positive relationship between
water uptake and calcium accumulation over 83 days (64). However, with the movement of Ca2⫹ in the
symplasm of the endodermis apparently being required for xylem loading, it became accepted that Ca2⫹
is taken up in direct proportion to plant growth, as new cation-exchange sites are made available in new
tissue. The link with transpiration could therefore be incidental, because bigger plants transpire more.
Thus the plant acts as a giant cation exchanger, taking up calcium in proportion to its rate of growth.

Supplying  calcium  to  decapitated  plants  at  increased  ion  activity  (concentration)  leads  to
increased uptake of the ion, a process that appears to contradict this concept. However, in intact
plants, the rate of uptake is independent of external ion activity, as long as the ratios of activities of
other cations are constant relative to the activity of Ca2⫹ (65,66).

The theory that calcium travels across the root in the apoplastic pathway, until it reaches the
Casparian band of the endodermis and at which its passage to the xylem becomes symplastic, is not
entirely without problems. White (56,67) calculated that for suﬃcient calcium loading into xylem,
there must be two calcium-speciﬁc ion channels per µm2 of plasmalemma on the cortex side of the
endodermis. This  possibility  is  plausible.  However, for  the  ﬂux  of  calcium  to  continue  from  the
endodermis  into  the  pericycle  there  must  be  0.8 ng  Ca2⫹-ATPase  protein  per  cell, equivalent  to
1.3 mg per gram of root fresh weight. This concentration is greater than the average total root plas-
malemma  protein  concentration  in  plants.  Furthermore, there  is  no  competition  between  Ca2⫹,
Ba2⫹, and Sr2⫹ for transport to mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh.) shoots, as would be
expected if there was protein-mediated transport in the symplast. Some apoplastic transport to the
xylem cannot be ruled out.

The walls of xylem vessels have cation-exchange sites on them; in addition to the whole plant
having a CEC, the xylem represents a long cation-exchange column with the Ca2⫹ ions moving
along  in  a  series  of  jumps  (54).  The  distance  between  each  site  where  cation  exchange  occurs
depends on the velocity of the xylem sap and the concentration of Ca2⫹ ions in it (54). Thus, for
transpiring organs such as mature leaves, the calcium moves into them quickly, but for growing 
tissues such as the areas close to meristems, the supply of calcium is dependent on the deposition
of cell walls and the formation of new cation-exchange sites (54). It has been suggested that tran-
spiring organs receive their calcium in the transpiration stream during the day, and growing tissues
receive their calcium as a result of root pressure during the night (54).

The restriction in movement of calcium to the xylem gives rise to most of the calcium-deﬁciency
disorders in plants. For example, BER (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5) in tomatoes occurs because the
developing fruits are supplied solutes better by phloem than by xylem as the fruits do not transpire.
Xylem ﬂuid goes preferentially to actively transpiring leaves, giving a lower input of calcium into
developing fruits (68). A period of hot, sunny weather not only gives rise to so much transpiration
that calcium is actively pulled into leaves, but gives rates of photosynthesis that are enhanced to the
extent that fruits expand very rapidly. Under these conditions, it is likely that localized deﬁciencies
of calcium will occur in the distal end of the fruits, furthest from where the xylem enters them (the
‘blossom’ end) (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5). Typically, tomatoes grown for harvest in trusses are more
susceptible to BER than ‘single-pick’ types, presumably because the calcium has to be distributed to
several developing sinks at the same time. Conditions that promote leaf transpiration, such as low
humidity, lower the import of calcium into developing fruits and increase the risk of BER.

It  has  also  been  thought  in  the  past  that  salinity, which  increases  water  potential  in  the  root
medium, would likewise restrict calcium import into the fruit, accounting for increased incidence of
BER that is known to occur under saline conditions. This eﬀect of salinity could be important in some
natural soils, but is also important in glasshouse production of tomatoes as high-electroconductivity
(EC) nutrient solutions are sometimes used because they increase dry matter production in fruits and
improve  ﬂavor.  However, it  has  been  observed  that  if  the  ion  activity  ratios  aK/兹(aCa
⫹ aMg)  and
aMg/aCa are kept below critical values, the risks of BER developing in high-EC nutrient solutions are

CRC_DK2972_Ch005.qxd  7/5/2006  8:49 AM  Page 132

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

lowered  (69).  It  seems  as  if  one  of  the  causes  of  increased  BER  with  salinity  is  normally  due  to
increased uptake of K⫹ and Mg2⫹, which restricts the uptake and distribution of Ca2⫹ ions.

Cultivars diﬀer in susceptibility to BER, with beefsteak and plum types of tomato being partic-
ularly  susceptible.  Susceptibility  is  related  partly  to  fruit  yield, and  two  susceptible  cultivars  of
tomato (Calypso and Spectra) were shown to have a higher rate of fruit set than a nonsusceptible cul-
tivar (Counter) (70). The so-called calcium-eﬃcient strains of tomato do not have lower incidence of
BER, since although they accumulate more dry matter than Ca-ineﬃcient strains, this accumulation
is predominantly in the leaves (64). Cultivars with relatively small fruits, such as Counter (70), and
with xylem development in the fruit that is still strong under saline conditions (71), are able to accu-
mulate comparatively high proportions of their calcium in the distal end of the fruits under such con-
ditions and are less susceptible to BER (64). However, cultivars with low yields of fruits per plant
may show even lower incidence of BER than those with high yields (64).

Losses of tomatoes to BER in commercial horticulture can reach 5% in some crops, represent-
ing a substantial loss of potential income. The main approaches to prevent BER are to use less-sus-
ceptible cultivars and to cover the south-facing side of the glasshouse (in the northern hemisphere)
with white plastic or whitewash to limit the amount of solar radiation of the nearest plants and pre-
vent their fruits from developing too quickly in relation to their abilities to accumulate calcium.

5.3.2.3 Calcicole and Calcifuge Species

In  general, calcicole  species  contain  high  concentrations  of  intracellular  calcium, and  calcifuge
species contain low concentrations of intracellular calcium. The diﬀerent geographic distributions
of these plants seem to be largely determined by a range of soil conditions other than just calcium
concentration in the soil per se. In the calcareous soils favored by calcicoles, in addition to high
concentration of Ca2⫹, pH is high, giving low solubility of heavy metal ions and high concentra-
tions of nutrient and bicarbonate ions. In contrast, the acid soils favored by calcifuges have low pH,
high solubility of heavy metal ions, and low availability of nutrients (5).

The growth of calcicole species is related strongly to the concentration of calcium in the soil,
but the inability of calcicole species to grow in acid soils is linked strongly to an inability to toler-
ate the high concentrations of ions of heavy metals, in particular Al3⫹, Mn2⫹, and Fe3⫹ (5,72). For
calcifuge species, the diﬃculty in growing in a calcareous soil stems from an inability to absorb
iron, although in some calcareous soils low availability of phosphate may also be a critical factor.
In an experiment with tropical soils in which the sorption of phosphate from Ca(H2PO4)2 solu-
tion (and its subsequent desorption) were measured, pretreating the soil with calcium sulfate solu-
tion  increased  the  sorption  of  phosphate  (73).  In  the  most  acid  of  the  soils  tested, sorption  of
phosphate  was  increased  by  93%.  Because  the  extracts  of  the  soil  became  more  acid  following 
calcium sulfate treatment, it appears that the calcium was attracted to the sites previously occupied
by H⫹ ions, and when present, itself oﬀered more sites for sorption of phosphate ions. Where the
supply of phosphorus to plants is limited because it is sorbed to soil inorganic fractions, it seems as
if sorption to calcium is more diﬃcult to break than sorption to other components. In an experiment
in which wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) were grown in a fossil
Oxisol, with mainly Fe/Al-bound P, and in a Luvisol, a subsoil from loess with free CaCO3 and
mainly Ca-bound P, both species (but particularly the sugar beet) were able to mobilize the Fe/Al-
bound P more than the Ca-bound P (74).

Some  plants  are  much  more  eﬃcient  than  others  at  taking  up  phosphate  from  calcium-bound
pools in the soil. One eﬃcient species is buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench). In a compar-
ison of this species and wheat, the buckwheat took up 20.1 mg P per pot compared with 2.1 mg P per
pot for wheat if nitrogen was supplied as nitrate (75). Changing the nitrogen supply to ammonium
nitrate increased phosphorus accumulation by the wheat largely, with very little eﬀect on the buck-
wheat, indicating that it is the capacity of buckwheat to acidify the rhizosphere even when the nitro-
gen supply is nitrate that makes buckwheat able to utilize this ﬁrmly bound source of phosphorus.

Calcium

133

For calcifuge species growing on calcareous soils, it seems as if the availability of iron is the
most  signiﬁcant  factor  aﬀecting  plant  growth, with  chlorosis  occurring  due  to  iron  deﬁciency.
However, this deﬁciency is caused largely by immobilization of iron within the leaves, not neces-
sarily a restricted absorption of iron (76,77). Calcicole species seem to make iron and phosphate
available in calcareous soils by exudation of oxalic and citric acids from their roots (78). The high
concentrations of bicarbonate ions in calcareous soils seem to be important in inhibition of root
elongation of some calcifuge species (79).

5.3.2.4 Critical Concentrations of Calcium

The  concentrations  of  calcium  in  plants  are  similar  to  the  concentrations  of  potassium, in  the
range 1 to 50 mg Ca g⫺1 dry matter (Mengel, this volume). Most of the calcium is located in the
apoplast, and where it is present in the symplast, it tends to be stored in organelles or vacuoles or
is bound to proteins. The concentration of free Ca2⫹ in a root cortical cell is of the order of 0.1
to 1.0 mmol m⫺3 (54).

In  general, monocotyledons  contain  much  less  calcium  than  dicotyledons.  In  an  experiment
comparing the growth of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tomato, the ryegrass reached its maxi-
mum growth rate when the concentration of calcium supplied gave a tissue concentration of 0.7 mg
g⫺1 dry mass, whereas tomato reached its maximum growth rate only when tissue concentration was
12.9 mg g⫺1 (80,81). This diﬀerence between monocotyledons and dicotyledons is dictated by the
CEC of the two groups of plants. In algal species, where the cell wall is absent and CEC is conse-
quently low, calcium is required only as a micronutrient (82).

Tissue concentrations of calcium can vary considerably according to the rate of calcium sup-
ply. In a study by Loneragan and Snowball (81), internal Ca2⫹ concentrations were reasonably
constant for 0.3, 0.8, and 2.5 µM calcium in the ﬂowing nutrient solutions for each plant species
tested, but with 10, 100, or 1000 µM Ca2⫹ supply, internal Ca2⫹ concentrations were noticeably
higher. In a recent study of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), nine diﬀerent Kabuli (large-seeded)
accessions had a mean concentration of Ca2⫹ in nodes 4 to 7 of the shoot of 17.4 mg g⫺1 dry mass
after 33 days of growth, and 10 diﬀerent Desi (small-seeded) accessions had a mean Ca2⫹ con-
centration of 17.1 mg g⫺1 dry mass (83). In the Kabuli accessions, the range was between 13.5
and  20.6 mg  g⫺1, compared  with  between  13.1  and  19.0 mg  g⫺1 in  the  Desi  accessions, so
diﬀerent genotypes of the same species grown under the same conditions seem to contain very
similar shoot calcium concentrations.

There are considerable amounts of data regarding what the critical concentrations of calcium
are in diﬀerent plants and diﬀerent species. For data on these concentrations in a large number of
species, the reader is referred to some special publications (84,85).

In a study of three cultivars of bell pepper, mean tissue concentrations ranged only from 1.5 to
1.8 mg g⫺1 dry mass in the proximal parts and from 0.95 to 1.3 mg g⫺1 dry mass in the distal part
of  healthy  fruits.  concentrations  in  fruits  suﬀering  BER  were  between  0.6  and  1.0 mg  g⫺1 (86).
Concentrations of calcium in fruits of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), a plant that is not suscepti-
ble to BER, are typically three to seven times these values (87).

There is one important exception to the ﬁnding that internal calcium concentrations are rela-
tively constant regardless of how plants are grown. Plants supplied with nitrogen as ammonium tend
to have much lower concentrations of cations, including calcium, than plants supplied with nitrate
(22). Thus, tomato plants supplied with ammonium-N are more prone to BER than plants grown on

5.4 ASSESSMENT OF CALCIUM STATUS IN SOILS

5.4.1 FORMS OF CALCIUM IN SOIL
Calcium is the main exchangeable base of clay minerals and, as such, is a major component of soils.
One of the most important natural sources of calcium is underlying limestone or chalk, where it
occurs as calcium carbonate (calcite). Calcium in rocks also occurs as a mixture of calcium and
magnesium carbonates (dolomite). Soils over such rocks often contain large amounts of calcium
carbonate, although not invariably so. The soils may not have been derived from the rock, but have

come from elsewhere and been deposited by glaciers, and furthermore, although calcium carbonate
is sparingly water soluble, it can be removed by leaching so that the overlying soil may be depleted
of calcium carbonate and be acidic.

Some soils contain calcium sulfate (gypsum), but mostly only in arid regions. A further source of
calcium  in  soils  is  apatite  [Ca(OH2).3Ca(PO4)2]  or  ﬂuorapatite  [Ca5(PO4)3F].  Chlorapatite
[Ca5(PO4)3Cl] and hydroxyapatite [Ca5(PO4)3OH] also exist in soils (98). Calcium is also present in the
primary minerals augite [Ca(Mg,Fe,Al)(Al,Si)2O6], hornblende [NaCa2(Mg,Fe,Al)5(Si,Al)8O22(OH)2],
and the feldspar plagioclase (any intermediate between CaAl2Si2O8 and NaAlSi3O8) (98).

Within the fraction of soils where particles are as small as clay particles, calcium occurs in gyp-
sum, calcite, hornblende, and plagioclase. Sherman and Jackson (99) arranged the minerals in the clay
fractions of the A horizons of soils in a series according to the time taken for them to weather away
to a diﬀerent mineral. These calcium-containing minerals are all early in this sequence, meaning that
calcium is lost from the minerals (and becomes available to plants) early in the weathering process,
but has been entirely lost as a structural component in more mature soils (98). Any calcium present in
these more mature soils will be present attached to cation-exchange sites, where it usually constitutes
a high proportion of total exchangeable cations, so the amounts present depend on the CEC of the soil.
Concentrations of Ca2⫹ in soils may be aﬀected by ecological disturbance. Acid depositions are
known to decrease Ca2⫹ concentrations in soils, which while not necessarily aﬀecting plant yields
directly may have a big impact on ecosystem dynamics. Acid deposition on the coniferous forests
of the Netherlands has been shown to give rise to fewer snails, and the birds that feed on the snails
have fewer surviving oﬀspring due to defects in their eggs (100). This eﬀect seems to be related
largely to the abundance of snails being depressed by low calcium concentrations in the plant litter.
In terms of how serious this problem might prove to be, it should be noted that changes in soil Ca2⫹
concentration caused by acid rain are less than 1 g Ca2⫹ m⫺2 year⫺1. This change is small compared
with a transfer of 3.3 to 4.7 g Ca2⫹ m⫺2 year⫺1 from mineral soil to young forest stands (101).

Experiments on the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA, have shown
that calcium is lost from ecosystems following deforestation. This loss is true for other cations and
also for nitrate. In the Hubbard Brook experiment, during the 4 years following deforestation, the
watershed  lost  74.9 kg  Ca2⫹ ha⫺1 year⫺1 as  dissolved  substances  in  the  streams, compared  with
9.7 kg Ca2⫹ ha⫺1 year⫺1 in a watershed where the vegetation had not been cut down (102). This
increased loss was attributed partly to increased water ﬂows due to decreased water loss by tran-
spiration, but more importantly through the breakdown of the plant material enhancing the turnover
of the nitrogen cycle and the consequent generation of H⫹ ions, thereby releasing cations from the
cation-exchange sites of the soil (102). Recent studies have shown that calcium loss continues for
at least 30 years, with the longer-term loss possibly occurring because of the breakdown of calcium
oxalate in the forest soil after removal of the trees (103).

5.4.2 SOIL TESTS
The main test for soil calcium is to calculate the amount of the limestone required for a particular
crop on a particular soil (see 5.5.2 below).

5.4.3 TABULATED DATA ON CALCIUM CONTENTS IN SOILS
Concentrations of Ca2⫹ in soils typical of a range of soil orders are shown in Table 5.3.

5.5 FERTILIZERS FOR CALCIUM

5.5.1 KINDS OF FERTILIZER
The most common application of calcium to soils is as calcium carbonate in chalk or lime. This
practice occurred in Britain and Gaul before the Romans (Pliny, quoted in Ref. (105)). It does not

come strictly under the deﬁnition of fertilizer, as the main functions of the calcium carbonate are to
make clay particles aggregate into crumbs, thereby improving drainage, and to lower soil acidity.
Despite the observation that addition of gypsum to tropical soils may increase the sorption of
phosphate (73), it seems as if this eﬀect is not universal, and it is the change in pH brought about
by limestone or dolomite that is more important in aiding phosphate sorption than the provision of
Ca2⫹ ions. In an experiment on addition of calcium carbonate, dolomite, gypsum, and calcium chlo-
ride to the Ap horizon of a Spodosol, all additions increased the retention of phosphorus in the soil
except the calcium chloride (106). The order of this increase was calcium carbonate > dolomite >
gypsum, which followed the order of increase in pH. Gypsum is not expected to increase pH of soil,
but it is likely that this pH change, and the consequent eﬀect on phosphorus sorption, was due to
impurities, likely lime, in the gypsum used.

⫹ and  H⫹ ions  on  the  cation-exchange  sites.  The Al(OH)2

Following  an  addition  of  lime, Ca2⫹ from  the  calcium  carbonate  (CaCO3)  exchanges  for
⫹ ions  give  rise  to  insoluble
Al(OH)2
Al(OH)3 that precipitates; the H⫹ ions react with bicarbonate (HCO3)⫺ that arises during the disso-
lution of calcium carbonate in the soil water. This reaction leads to the formation of carbon diox-
ide, lost from the soil as a gas, and water, both of which are neutral products (107).

In very acid soils, there is a shortage of available calcium, and application of calcium carbon-
ate will help rectify this problem. One of the outcomes of adding calcium would be to displace Al3⫹
and  H⫹ ions  from  the  root  plasmalemma, where  they  would  otherwise  be  displacing  Ca2⫹ ions
(108). Experiments with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) grown on acid soils showed that while appli-
cation of lime increased calcium concentrations in the shoots, it also decreased concentrations of
aluminum, manganese, and iron. As those cultivars that were the least sensitive to the acid soil had

CRC_DK2972_Ch005.qxd  7/5/2006  8:49 AM  Page 139

Calcium

139

lower concentrations of these three elements anyway, it seems as if the beneﬁcial eﬀect of the lime
was in modifying soil pH rather than supplying additional Ca (109).

The more neutral or alkaline pH brought about by liming gives a more favorable environ-
ment  for  the  microorganisms  of  the  nitrogen  cycle, enhancing  the  cycling  of  nitrogen  from
organic matter. It also increases the availability of molybdenum, and it restricts the uptake of
heavy metals (107).

Another action of lime is to decrease the concentration of ﬂuoride in tea (Camellia sinensis L.)
plants. This crop accumulates high concentrations of  ﬂuoride from soils of normal  ﬂuoride con-
centration. The action of liming in limiting ﬂuoride concentrations in tea plants is surprising given
that the uptake of ﬂuoride is higher from more neutral soil than from acid soil and given that lim-
ing may increase the water-soluble ﬂuoride content of the soil (110). In this case, it appears that the
Ca2⫹ in the lime either aﬀects cell wall and plasmalemma permeability or changes the speciation of
the ﬂuoride in the soil.

In some instances calcium sulfate (gypsum) may be applied as a fertilizer, but this application
is more for a source of sulfur than calcium or to improve soil structure. Apatite (applied as rock
phosphate) and superphosphate contain twice as much calcium by weight as the phosphorus that
they are used primarily to supply, and triple superphosphate contains two thirds as much calcium as
phosphorus (98). One situation where gypsum is particularly useful is in the reclamation of sodic
soils, where the calcium ions replace the sodium on the cation-exchange sites and the sodium sul-
fate that results is leached out of the soil (107).

Calcium nitrate and calcium chloride are regularly used as sprays on developing apple fruits to
prevent bitter pit (111). Of the two calcium forms, nitrate is less likely to cause leaf scorch, but some
varieties of apple are susceptible to fruit spotting with nitrate. Dipping the fruit in CaCl2 immedi-
ately after harvest supplements the regular sprays (111). Spraying apple trees with calcium nitrate
during the cell expansion phase of fruit growth increases the nitrogen and the calcium concentra-
tions in the fruit at harvest and gives ﬁrmer fruit at harvest and after storage (112).

Application of calcium salts to sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) fruits just before harvest may also
decrease the incidence of skin cracking that follows any heavy rainfall at this time (43). Multiple appli-
cations throughout the summer give better protection, and CaCl2 is better than Ca(OH)2, as the latter
can cause fruit to shrivel in hot seasons (113). Recent research has shown that spraying CaCl2 and
boron with a suitable surfactant on strawberry plants at 5-day intervals from the time of petal fall gives
fruits that are ﬁrmer and more resistant to botrytis rot at harvest, or after 3 days storage, than untreated
fruits; after the 3 days, they have a higher concentration of soluble solids and more titratable acidity
(114). Treating  pineapples  with  lime  during  their  growth  seems  to  lower  the  incidence  of  internal
browning that arises in the fruit in cold storage, and increases their ascorbic acid content (38). The
fruit of tomato cultivars particularly susceptible to BER (e.g., the beefsteak cultivar Jack Hawkins)
may be sprayed with calcium salts, although the eﬃcacy of this treatment is doubtful.

There are also calcium treatments for improving shelf life and fruit quality that are used after
harvest. For example, dipping cherry tomatoes in 25 mM CaCl2 after harvest increases apoplastic
calcium concentrations and decreases incidence of skin cracking (115). Vacuum inﬁltration of Ca2⫹
increases the time of ripening of peaches, so that they can be stored for longer periods before sale,
and such use of calcium salts is common for tomatoes, mangoes (Mangifera indica L.), and avoca-
does (Persea americana L.) (116). The ﬁrmness of plums (Prunus domestica L.) is increased by
pressure inﬁltration of 1 mM CaCl2 (117).

There  is  some  evidence  that  supply  of  supplementary  calcium  nitrate  partially  alleviates  the
eﬀects  of  NaCl  salinity  in  strawberry  in  hydroponic  culture  (118)  and  in  cucumber  and  melon
(Cucumis spp. L.) in irrigated ﬁelds (119).

5.5.2 APPLICATION OF CALCIUM FERTILIZERS
Liming is carried out by application of CaCO3 in limestone, a process that is described in some
detail in Troeh and Thompson (98). The neutralizing capacity of the limestone used is measured by

CRC_DK2972_Ch005.qxd  7/5/2006  8:49 AM  Page 140

140

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

comparing it to calcite, which is CaCO3, with a calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) of 100%. The
ﬁneness of the lime aﬀects its eﬃciency for liming, and the CCE and ﬁneness and hardness of the
lime  together  give  the  eﬀective  calcium  carbonate  equivalent or  reactivity.  Application  should
occur when the soil is dry or frozen, to avoid damage to the soil by the vehicles carrying the lime.
Although soil testing will determine if an application is required, it is often the practice to apply
lime a year ahead of a crop in a rotation that has a strong lime requirement (often a legume). An
application once every 4 to 8 years is usually eﬀective. Limestone, burned lime (CaO), or slaked
lime [Ca(OH)2] can also be used. Burned lime has a CCE of 179% and slaked lime a CCE of 133%.
The amount of lime required is determined from soil analysis, either by a pH base saturation
method or a buﬀer solution method (98,120). The soil requirement for lime, deﬁned, for example,
as the number of tonnes of calcium carbonate required to raise the pH of a hectare of soil 200 mm
deep to pH 6.5 (120), will depend on the initial pH and also on CEC of the soil. Most soils have a
much greater proportion of their cations attached to cation-exchange sites than in solution, mean-
ing that a high proportion of the H⫹ ions present are not measured in a simple pH test. Adding lime
to the soil neutralizes the acidity in the soil solution, but the Ca2⫹ ions displace H⫹ ions from the
exchange sites, with the potential to make the pH of the soil acidic once more, and this acidity is
neutralized by reaction of the H⫹ with the lime. The H⫹ in soil solution is called the active acidity,
and the H⫹ held to the exchange sites on soil colloids is called the reserve acidity The greater the
CEC, the greater the reserve acidity and the greater the lime requirement (98).

In the pH-base saturation method, the percent base saturation of the soil, the CEC of the soil
and the initial pH all have to be measured. To calculate how much lime should be added the percent
base saturation at the initial and at the target pH value are read oﬀ a graph, and the amount of CaCO3
to be added is calculated from the diﬀerence in percent base saturation at the two pH values multi-
plied by the CEC (98).

In the buﬀer solution method, a sample of the soil is mixed with a buﬀer, and the amount of

lime required is read oﬀ a table from the value of decrease in buﬀer pH on adding the soil (120).

6.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION

6.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
The word ‘magnesium’ is derived from ‘magnesia’ for the Magnesia district in Greece where talc
(magnesium stone) was ﬁrst mined (1,2). However, there are other cities that are also named after
the magnesium deposits in local regions (3). In 1808, Sir Humphry Davy discovered magnesium,
but  named  it  magnium, because  he  considered  magnesium  to  sound  too  much  like  manganese.
However, in  time, the  word  magnesium  was  adopted  (3–6). Twenty  years  later, magnesium  was
puriﬁed by the French scientist, Bussy (7). The essentiality of magnesium in plants was established
nearly 50 years later (around 1860) by scientists such as Knop, Mayer, Sachs, and Salm-Horstmar
(4,8,9), and during the period 1904–1912, Willstatter identiﬁed magnesium as part of the chloro-
phyll molecule (3,6). For many years, magnesium was applied unknowingly to agricultural lands
through manure applications or as an impurity with other processed fertilizers (10); therefore, inci-
dences of magnesium deﬁciency were relatively uncommon. One of the ﬁrst mentions of magne-
sium deﬁciency in plants was in 1923 on tobacco and was referred to as ‘sand drown,’ since the
environmental conditions that were associated with magnesium deﬁciency occurred in excessively
leached sandy soils (11). Over 100 years later, magnesium has become a global concern, as scien-
tists suggest that magnesium deﬁciency may be one of the major factors causing forest decline in
Europe and North America (12–17). This malady may be an indirect result of the acidiﬁcation of
soils by acid rain, which can cause leaching of magnesium as well as other alkali metals.

Magnesium is also an essential nutrient for animals. If forage crops, commonly grasses, are low
in magnesium, grazing animals may develop hypomagnesia, sometimes called grass tetany. For this
reason, many studies have been conducted on magnesium nutrition in forage crops, in an eﬀort to
prevent this disorder (18–24). Based on the review of fertilizer recommendations for ﬁeld soils in
the Netherlands by Henkens (25), the magnesium requirement for forage crops is closely associated
with the concentration of potassium and crude protein in the crop. This relationship of magnesium
with  potassium  and  crude  protein  (nitrogen)  for  animal  nutrition  is  not  much  diﬀerent  from  the
magnesium-potassium-nitrogen associations in plant nutrition.

6.2 FUNCTION IN PLANTS

6.2.1 METABOLIC PROCESSES
Magnesium has major physiological and molecular roles in plants, such as being a component of
the chlorophyll molecule, a cofactor for many enzymatic processes associated with phosphoryla-
tion, dephosphorylation, and the hydrolysis of various compounds, and as a structural stabilizer for
various nucleotides. Studies indicate that 15 to 30% of the total magnesium in plants is associated
with the chlorophyll molecule (26,27). In citrus (Citrus volkameriana Ten. & Pasq.), magnesium
deﬁciency was associated directly with lower total leaf chlorophyll (28); however, there were no
eﬀects on chlorophyll a/b ratios within the magnesium-deﬁcient leaves.

Magnesium

The other 70 to 85% of the magnesium in plants is associated with the role of magnesium as a
cofactor in various enzymatic processes (1,2,26,29), the regulation of membrane channels and recep-
tor proteins (30,31), and the structural role in stabilizing proteins and the conﬁgurations of DNA and
RNA strands (32,33). Since magnesium is an integral component of the chlorophyll molecule and the
enzymatic processes associated with photosynthesis and respiration, the assimilation of carbon and
energy  transformations  will  be  aﬀected  directly  by  inadequate  magnesium.  In  nutrient  ﬁlm-grown
potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), relatively low (0.05 mM) or high (4.0 mM) magnesium concentrations
increased dark respiration rates and decreased photosynthetic rates relative to magnesium fertilization
rates ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mM (34). In hydroponically grown sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.),
photosynthetic rates decreased in ammonium-fertilized, but not nitrate-fertilized plants when the mag-
nesium concentration of nutrient solutions decreased below 2 mM (35). This eﬀect was related to the
decreased  enzymatic  activity  as  well  as  the  decrease  in  photosynthetic  capacity  due  to  the  loss  in
assimilating leaf area, occurring mainly as a consequence of leaf necrosis and defoliation (36).

Magnesium  may  also  inﬂuence  various  physiological  aspects  related  to  leaf  water  relations
(37,38). In hydroponically grown tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), increasing magnesium fer-
tilization  from  0.5  to  10 mM  resulted  in  an  increase  in  leaf  stomatal  conductance  (Gs)  and  turgor
p) and a decrease in osmotic potential (Ψπ) but had no eﬀect on leaf water potential (Ψ
potential (Ψ
w)
(37). In other studies (38) where low leaf water potentials were induced in sunﬂower (Helianthus
annuus L.) leaves, the increased magnesium concentrations in the stroma, caused by decreased stroma
volume  due  to  dehydration, caused  magnesium  to  bind  to  the  chloroplast-coupling  factor, thereby
inhibiting the ATPase activity of the enzyme and inhibiting photophosphorylation. Other experiments
(39–41) have indicated that even though up to 1.2 mM magnesium may be required in the ATPase
complex of photophosphorylation, magnesium concentrations of 5 mM or higher result in conforma-
tional changes in the chloroplast-coupling factor, which causes inhibition of the ATPase enzyme.

As regards to the role of magnesium in molecular biology, magnesium is an integral component of
RNA, stabilizing the conformational structure of the negatively charged functional groups and also con-
currently neutralizing the RNA molecule (42–44). In many cases, the role of the magnesium ion in the
conﬁgurations and stabilities of many polynucleotides is not replaceable with other cations, since the lig-
and conﬁgurations are of a speciﬁc geometry that are capable of housing only magnesium ions (45). In
addition, magnesium serves as a cofactor for enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis and formation of
phosphodiester bonds associated with the transcription, translation, and replication of nucleic acids (1,2).

6.2.2 GROWTH
Magnesium deﬁciency may suppress the overall increase in plant mass or speciﬁcally suppress root
or shoot growth. However, the extent of growth inhibition of roots and shoots will be inﬂuenced by
the  severity  of  the  magnesium  deﬁciency, plant  type, stage  of  plant  development, environmental
conditions, and the general nutritional status of the crop. In tomato, suboptimal magnesium con-
centrations  did  not  aﬀect  overall  plant  growth  (37);  however, an  accumulation  of  assimilates
occurred  in  the  shoots, suggesting  that  assimilate  transport  from  the  shoots  to  the  roots  was
impaired. For birch (Betula pendula Roth.) seedlings, decreased magnesium availability in the rhi-
zosphere had no eﬀect on root branching pattern but decreased root length, root diameter, and root
dry weight (36). In addition, the fraction of dry matter allocated to the leaves increased even though
overall leaf area decreased (36). In raspberry (Rubus spp. L.), enhanced shoot growth was corre-
lated with increased magnesium in the leaves (46,47).

6.2.3 FRUIT YIELD AND QUALITY
Magnesium deﬁciencies and toxicities may decrease fruit yield and quality. In two cultivars of apple
(Malus pumila Mill.), fruit magnesium concentrations were correlated negatively with fruit color,
whereas fruit potassium concentrations were positively correlated with fruit color (48). The eﬀects

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 148

148

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

of magnesium on apple fruit quality may have been due to antagonistic eﬀects on potassium uptake
and accumulation. In tomato, even though increasing magnesium fertilization rates did not aﬀect
total shoot dry weight, overall fruit yield decreased with increased magnesium fertilization supply
from 0.5 to 10 mM (37).

6.3 DIAGNOSIS OF MAGNESIUM STATUS IN PLANTS

6.3.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY AND EXCESS

6.3.1.1 Symptoms of Deficiency
In a physiological sense, magnesium deﬁciency symptoms are expressed ﬁrst as an accumulation of
starch  in  the  leaves  (49), which  may  be  associated  with  early  reductions  in  plant  growth  and
decreased allocation of carbohydrates from leaves to developing sinks (50). This process is followed
by the appearance of chlorosis in older leaves, patterns of which can be explained by the physio-
logical  processes  associated  with  magnesium  uptake,
translocation, and  metabolism  in 
plants (3–5,49). Magnesium is physiologically mobile within the plant. Therefore, if insuﬃcient
magnesium is available from the rhizosphere, magnesium can be reallocated from other plant parts
and transported through the phloem to the actively growing sinks. Because of this mobility within
the plant, symptoms of deﬁciency will  ﬁrst be expressed in the oldest leaves (Figure 6.1). Early
symptoms of magnesium deﬁciency may be noted by fading and yellowing of the tips of old leaves
(49,51,52), which progresses interveinally toward the base and midrib of leaves, giving a mottled
or  herringbone  appearance  (52).  In  later  stages  of  development, deﬁciency  symptoms  may  be
diﬃcult to distinguish from those of potassium deﬁciency. Under mild deﬁciencies, a ‘V’-patterned
interveinal chlorosis develops in dicots as a result of magnesium dissociating from the chlorophyll,
resulting  in  chlorophyll  degradation.  In  conifers, minor  magnesium  deﬁciency  symptoms  are
browning of older needle tips (0.10% magnesium concentration) and in more severe deﬁciencies,
the  enter  needle  turns  brown  and  senesce  (0.07%  magnesium  concentration)  (49,53).  In  some
plants, a  reddening  of  the  leaves  may  occur, rather  than  chlorosis, as  is  the  case  for  cotton
(Gossypium spp.) (52,54), since other plant pigments may not break down as quickly as chlorophyll.
The loss of protein from magnesium-deﬁcient leaves, however, usually results in the loss of plastic
pigments from most plants (55). On an individual leaf, as well as on a whole plant basis, deﬁciency

ber (Cucumis sativus L.). (Photographs by Allen V. Barker.) (For a color presentation of this figure, see the

symptoms may begin to appear only on the portions of a leaf or the plant that are exposed to the
sun, with the shaded portions of leaves remaining green (49,56). Under severe deﬁciency symp-
toms, all lower leaves become necrotic and senesce (28,36) with symptoms of interveinal yellow-
ing progressing to younger leaves (36,56).

Magnesium has functions in protein synthesis that can aﬀect the size, structure, and function of
chloroplasts (26). The requirement of magnesium in protein synthesis is apparent in chloroplasts, where
magnesium is essential for the synthesis and maintenance of proteins in the thylakoids of the chloro-
phyll  molecule  (57–59).  Hence, the  degradation  of  proteins  in  chloroplasts  in  magnesium-deﬁcient
plants may lead to loss of chlorophyll as much as the loss of magnesium for chlorophyll synthesis.

On a cellular level, magnesium deﬁciency causes the formation of granules of approximately
80 nm in diameter in the mitochondria and leads to the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane
(60). In the chloroplasts, magnesium deﬁciency results in reduced and irregular grana and reduced
or nonexistent compartmentation of grana (61). Palomäki (53) noted that chloroplasts were rounded
and thylakoids were organized abnormally in magnesium-deﬁcient Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
seedlings. In the vascular system, magnesium deﬁciency may cause swelling of phloem cells and
collapse  of  surrounding  cells, collapse  of  sieve  cells, and  dilation  of  proximal  cambia  and
parenchyma  cells  in  conifers  (53).  These  alterations  at  the  cellular  level  occurred  before  visual
changes were evident and before a detectable decrease in leaf magnesium occurred.

6.3.1.2 Symptoms of Excess

During the early 1800s, symptoms of ‘magnesium’ toxicity in plants were described; however, dur-
ing this time, manganese was called magnesium and magnesium was referred to as magnium or
magnesia (3–5). Because of the confusion in nomenclature, early reports regarding magnesium and
manganese should be read carefully. At the present time, no speciﬁc symptoms are reported directly
related to magnesium toxicity in plants. However, relatively high magnesium concentrations can
elicit deﬁciency symptoms of other essential cations. Plant nutrients that are competitively inhib-
ited for absorption by relatively high magnesium concentrations include calcium and potassium and
occasionally iron (62). Therefore, symptoms of magnesium toxicity may be more closely associ-
ated with deﬁciency symptoms of calcium or potassium.

6.3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES OF DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS
Conditions of the soil and rhizosphere such as drought or irregular water availability (63,64), poor
drainage or excessive leaching (11), low soil pH (65–67), or cold temperatures (68,69) will exag-
gerate magnesium deﬁciency symptoms, as magnesium is not physically available under these envi-
ronmental  conditions  or  physiologically, the  plant  roots  are  not  capable  of  absorbing  adequate
magnesium to sustain normal plant growth.

Conditions of the soil and rhizosphere such as drought or irregular water availability will impact
magnesium uptake. In sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), foliar analysis indicated that magne-
sium deﬁciency occurred during drought (64). Likewise, Huang (63) reported that drought-stressed
tall  fescue  (Festuca  arundinacea Schreb.)  had  lower  leaf  magnesium  concentrations  than  well-
watered fescue.

Low soil pH is also associated with a low supply or depletion of magnesium, possibly due to
leaching; however, research suggests that impairment of root growth in acid soils (pH 4.3 to 4.7)
also  may  hinder  magnesium  absorption  (67).  In  one  study  (65), low  soil  pH  (3.0)  resulted  in
increased  accumulation  of  magnesium  in  the  shoots, but  decreased  accumulation  in  the  roots.
Contradicting Marler (65) and Tan et al. (67), Johnson et al. (70) found no clear correlation between
low soil pH and magnesium accumulation.

Relatively  high  and  low  root-zone  temperatures  aﬀect  magnesium  uptake, but  the  degree  of
impact  may  be  inﬂuenced  by  plant  type  and  stage  of  plant  development.  Huang  et  al.  (71)  and

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 150

150

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Huang  and  Grunes  (68)  reported  that  increasing  root-zone  temperature  (10, 15, 20⬚C)  linearly
increased magnesium accumulation by wheat seedlings that were less than 30 days old but sup-
pressed accumulation by seedlings that were more than 30 days old. Similarly, magnesium uptake
decreased when temperatures in the rhizosphere decreased from 20 to 10⬚C (69).

Although any environmental condition such as unfavorable soil temperature or pH may reduce
root  growth  and  thus  reduce  magnesium  uptake, other  characteristics  such  as  mycorrhizal  colo-
nization can increase magnesium uptake. Likewise, it has been shown that plants that have colo-
nization  of  roots  by  mycorrhiza  show  higher  amounts  of  magnesium  accumulation  relative  to
nonmycorrhizal plants (72–75).

Shoots exposed to environmental parameters such as high humidity (76), high light intensity
(77,78), or high or low air temperatures (79) will decrease the ability of plants to absorb and
translocate  magnesium, since  transpiration  is  reduced  and  the  translocation  of  magnesium  is
driven by transpiration rates (63,76,80–84).

Light intensity can aﬀect the expression of symptoms of magnesium deﬁciency. Partial shading
of magnesium-deﬁcient leaves has been shown to prevent or delay the development of chlorosis
(77).  Others  (49,56)  have  also  determined  that  magnesium  deﬁciency  symptoms  may  begin  to
appear only on the portions of a leaf or plant that are exposed to the sun, with the shaded portions
of leaves remaining green. Zhao and Oosterhuis (78) also reported that shading (63% light reduc-
tion)  increased  leaf-blade  concentrations  of  magnesium  in  cotton  plants  by  16%  relative  to
unshaded plants.

6.3.3 NUTRIENT IMBALANCES AND SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY
Magnesium deﬁciency symptoms may be associated with an antagonistic relationship between mag-
nesium ions (Mg2⫹) and other cations such as hydrogen (H⫹), ammonium (NH4
⫹), calcium (Ca2⫹),
potassium  (K⫹), aluminum  (Al3⫹), or  sodium  (Na⫹).  The  competition  of  magnesium  with  other
cations for uptake ranges from highest to lowest as follows: K ⬎ NH4
⫹ ⬎ Ca ⬎ Na (85,86). These
cations can compete with magnesium for binding sites on soil colloids, increasing the likelihood that
magnesium  will  be  leached  from  soils  after  it  has  been  released  from  exchange  sites. Within  the
plant, there are also antagonistic relationships between other cations and magnesium regarding the
aﬃnity for various binding sites within the cell membranes, the degree of which is inﬂuenced by 
the type of binding site (lipid, protein, chelate, etc.), and the hydration of the cation (87). These bio-
chemical interactions result in competition of other cations with magnesium for absorption into the
roots and translocation and assimilation in the plant (88–92).

6.3.3.1 Potassium and Magnesium

Increased  potassium  fertilization  or  availability, relative  to  magnesium, will  inhibit  magnesium
absorption and accumulation and vice versa (34,35,90,93–99). The degree of this antagonistic eﬀect
varies with potassium and magnesium fertilization rates, as well as the ratio of the two nutrients to one
another. This phenomenon has been documented in tomato (62,96), soybean (Glycine max Merr.),
(93,100), apple (101), poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray) (102), Bermuda grass (Cynodon
dactylon Pers.) (103–105), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (18), buckwheat (Fagopyrum escu-
lentum Moench) (93), corn (Zea mays L.) (98), and oats (Avena sativa L.) (93). Potassium chloride
fertilization  increased  cotton  (Gossypium  hirsutum L.)  plant  size  and  seed  and  lint  weight  and
increased eﬃciency of nitrogen use, but had suppressive eﬀects on magnesium accumulation in vari-
ous plant parts (106). Fontes et al. (107) reported that magnesium concentrations of potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) petioles declined as potassium fertilization with potassium sulfate increased from 0.00
to  800 kg  K  ha⫺1.  Legget  and  Gilbert  (100)  noted  that  with  excised  roots  of  soybean, magnesium
uptake was inhibited if calcium and potassium were both present but not if calcium or potassium was
present  alone.  The  opposite  also  holds  true  in  that  potassium  and  calcium  contents  of  roots  were

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 151

Magnesium

151

depressed  with  increasing  rates  of  magnesium  fertilization  (100).  Similar  results  were  obtained  in
potatoes  (Solanum  tuberosum L.)  where  increasing  magnesium  fertilization  from  0.05  to  4.0 mM
decreased the potassium concentration in shoots from 76.6 to 67.6 mg g⫺1 shoot dry weight (34).

6.3.3.2 Calcium and Magnesium

High rhizosphere concentrations of calcium, relative to magnesium, are inhibitory to the absorption
of  magnesium  and  vice  versa  (34,35,37,86,90,108–110).  In  the  early  1900s, the  importance  of
proper ratios of magnesium to calcium in soils was emphasized through studies conducted by Loew
and May (4) on the relationships of lime and dolomite. High calcium concentrations in solution or
in ﬁeld soils sometimes limit magnesium accumulation and may elicit magnesium deﬁciency symp-
toms (111–113). In tomato, the magnesium concentration in shoots (62) and fruits (114) decreased
as the calcium fertilization rate increased. Similarly, it was shown that increased calcium concen-
trations inhibited magnesium uptake in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (86). On the other
hand, decreased  accumulation  of  calcium  in  birch  was  directly  correlated  with  the  decreased
absorption  and  accumulation  of  calcium  as  magnesium  fertilization  rates  increased  (36).  The
absorption of calcium decreased from 1.5 to 0.3 mmol g⫺1 root mass as magnesium fertilization
increased (36). Morard et al. (115) reported a strong antagonism between calcium and magnesium,
suggesting that calcium inﬂuenced magnesium translocation to leaves. Optimum leaf Ca/Mg ratios
are considered to be approximately 2:1; however, Ca/Mg ratios >1:1 and ⬍5:1 can produce ade-
quate growth without the expression of magnesium deﬁciency (36,85). In a study with tomato, the
root, stem, and leaf calcium concentrations decreased as fertilization rates increased from 0.50 to
10.0 mM Mg in solution culture (37). Similarly, with woody ornamentals, high fertilization rates of
calcium relative to magnesium inhibited the accumulation of magnesium and decreased root and
shoot  growth, and  inversely, high  magnesium  decreased  calcium  accumulation  and  plant  growth
(35,109). Clark et al. (116) used ﬂue-gas desulfurization by-products to fertilize corn in greenhouse
experiments. They noted that the materials needed to be amended with magnesium at a ratio of 1
part magnesium to 20 parts of calcium to avoid magnesium deﬁciency in the corn. In containerized
crop production, general recommendations indicate suﬃcient calcium and magnesium additions to
produce an extractable Ca/Mg ratio of 2:5 (117). Navarro et al. (118) reported an antagonist eﬀect
of calcium on magnesium accumulation in melon (Cucumis melo L.), regardless of salinity levels
imposed by sodium chloride. In other studies (119–121), it was shown that even with the use of
dolomitic lime, magnesium deﬁciency might occur. This occurrence is due to the diﬀerent solubil-
ities of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the dolomite. Therefore,
during the ﬁrst 4 months, both magnesium and calcium solubilized from the dolomite. However,
after 4 months, all of the magnesium had dissolved from the dolomite, leaving only Ca from the
CaCO3 available for dissolution and availability to the plant (119,120). Based on these studies, it
appears that the use of solid calcium and magnesium fertilizers with similar solubility rates may be
important so that both elements are available in similar and suﬃcient levels throughout the entire
crop production cycle (119–121).

6.3.3.3 Nitrogen and Magnesium

Nitrogen may either inhibit or promote magnesium accumulation in plants, depending on the form
of nitrogen: with ammonium, magnesium uptake is suppressed and with nitrate, magnesium uptake
is increased (35,101,122–124). In ﬁeld soils, the chances of ammonium competing with magnesium
for plant uptake are more likely to occur in cool rather than warm soils because in warmer soils, most
ammonium is converted into nitrate by nitriﬁcation processes. In forests, high inputs of ammoniacal
nitrogen ampliﬁed latent magnesium  deﬁciency  (125).  In  conditions  of  sand  culture, ammonium-
nitrogen  of  Norway  spruce  (Picea  abies Karst.)  resulted  in  signiﬁcantly  lower  magnesium  and
chlorophyll  concentrations  in  current-year  and  year-old  needles  compared  to  fertilization  with

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 152

152

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

nitrate-nitrogen  (126).  Similarly, in  herbaceous  plants  such  as  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum L.)  (127) 
and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (128), ammoniacal nitrogen reduced shoot accumulation of magne-
sium (127). In cauliﬂower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.), increasing nitrate-nitrogen fertilization
from 90 to 270 kg ha⫺1 increased yield response to increased magnesium fertilization rates (22.5 to
90 kg  ha⫺1)  (129).  Similarly, in  hydroponically  grown  poinsettia  (Euphorbia  pulcherrima Willd.),
magnesium  concentrations  in  leaves  increased  as  the  proportion  of  nitrate-nitrogen  to  ammonium-
nitrogen increased, even though all treatments received the same amount of total nitrogen (130). In a
similar way, magnesium fertilization increased the plant accumulation of nitrogen, which was applied
as urea, in rice (Oryza sativa L.) (131). As with other nutrients, the degree of impact of nitrogen on
magnesium nutrition is inﬂuenced by the concentrations of the nutrients, relative to each other. For
example, Huang et al. (71) demonstrated with hydroponically grown wheat that nitrogen form had no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on shoot magnesium levels when magnesium concentrations in solutions were rela-
tively high (97 mg L⫺1); however, at low magnesium concentrations (26 mg L⫺1) in solutions, increas-
ing the proportion of ammonium relative to nitrate signiﬁcantly decreased shoot Mg concentrations.
In another study, Huang and Grunes (68) also noted that even though magnesium uptake rates were
signiﬁcantly higher for plants supplied with nitrate rather than ammonium, increasing the proportion
of the nitrogen supply as nitrate decreased net magnesium translocation to the shoots.

6.3.3.4 Sodium and Magnesium

High soil or nutrient-solution salinity levels (with NaCl), relative to magnesium supply, may inhibit
magnesium  accumulation  in  plants  (132–135).  However, results  are  variable  since  salinity  often
inhibits plant growth; therefore, there may be a reduction in the total uptake of a nutrient into a plant.
However, since the plant is smaller, the magnesium level, expressed in terms of concentration, may
be higher. Application of sodium-containing fertilizers (chloride or nitrate) lowered the concentration
of magnesium in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) leaves but increased the magnesium in perennial
ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (133). In hydroponically grown taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott.) (136)
and wheat (137), sodium chloride treatments resulted in a suppression of leaf magnesium. Use of
sodium chloride to suppress root and crown rot in asparagus (Asparagus oﬃcinalis L. var. altilis L.)
also suppressed magnesium accumulation in the leaves (138). Even in a halophyte such as Halopyrum
mucronatum Stapf., increasing  sodium  chloride  concentrations  in  nutrient  solutions  from  0.0  to
5220 mg  L⫺1 signiﬁcantly  decreased  magnesium  concentrations  in  the  shoots  and  roots  (134).
However, in hydroponically grown bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), sodium chloride increased leaf con-
centrations of magnesium, perhaps as a result of growth suppression (139). Growth suppression of
rice was associated with salinity, but the levels of magnesium in the leaves were unaﬀected (140).
Other research (141) found that sodium chloride increased accumulation of magnesium in shoots but
suppressed  magnesium  accumulation  in  roots  of  strawberry  (Fragaria  chiloensis Duchesne  var.
ananassa Bailey). In fact, some (142) have attributed the salt tolerance of some soybean cultivars to
the ability to accumulate potassium, calcium, and magnesium, in spite of saline conditions.

6.3.3.5 Iron and Magnesium
Uptake and accumulation of iron may be inhibited or unaﬀected by increased magnesium fertilization.
In  addition, the  translocation  of  magnesium  from  the  roots  to  the  shoots  may  decrease  in  iron-
deﬁcient plants relative to iron-suﬃcient plants (143). The antagonistic relationship of iron with mag-
nesium has been demonstrated in tomato (62) and radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (144). Nenova and
Stoyanov (143) noted that the uptake and translocation of magnesium was reduced in iron-deﬁcient
plants compared to iron-suﬃcient plants. However, Bavaresco (145) reported that under lime-induced
chlorosis, chlorotic grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves did not diﬀer from green leaves in nutrient compo-
sition, but the fruits of chlorotic plants were diﬀerent in that they had higher magnesium than fruits
from normal plants. Iron concentrations did not diﬀer among any of the tissues.

6.3.3.6 Manganese and Magnesium

Manganese, as a divalent cation, can compete with magnesium for binding sites on soil particles as
well as biological membranes within plants (146). However, manganese is required in such small
quantities (micromolar concentrations in nutrient solutions resulting in Manganese, as a divalent
cation, can compete with magnesium for binding sites on soil particles as well as biological mem-
branes within plants (146). However, manganese is required in such small quantities (micromolar
concentrations in nutrient solutions resulting in ⬇ 20 to 500 ppm in most plant tissues) that man-
ganese toxicity usually occurs before quantities are high enough to signiﬁcantly inhibit magnesium
uptake  to  physiologically  deﬁcient  levels  (62,85).  However, some  experiments  (147,148)  have
demonstrated  that  manganese  can  inhibit  magnesium  uptake.  However, Alam  et  al.  (147)  and
Qauartin  et  al.  (148)  did  not  indicate  if  the  inhibition  of  magnesium  was  substantial  enough  to
induce magnesium deﬁciency symptoms. On the other hand, increased magnesium fertilization has
been shown to decrease manganese uptake and accumulation (34,80), and in some cases, magne-
sium fertilization may mitigate manganese toxicity (149,150). In one study (151), the tolerance of
certain cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars to manganese appeared to be related to the ability
to accumulate more magnesium than by the manganese-sensitive cultivars.

6.3.3.7 Zinc and Magnesium

As with manganese, zinc is a divalent cation that is required in minuscule quantities for normal
plant  growth.  Therefore, plants  usually  suﬀer  from  zinc  toxicity  before  concentrations  are  high
enough to inhibit magnesium uptake. However, some research has indicated that as zinc increases
to toxic levels in plants, the accumulation of magnesium is suppressed, but not to the degree of
inducing magnesium deﬁciency symptoms. In hydroponically grown tomato (62), increasing zinc
concentrations  from  0.0  to  1.58 mg  L⫺1 did  not  aﬀect  magnesium  concentrations  in  shoots.
Similarly, nontoxic levels of zinc applications through zinc-containing fungicides or fertilization
(soil or foliar applied) did not aﬀect magnesium concentrations in potato leaves, although zinc con-
centrations increased in leaves (152). However, at higher zinc concentrations (30 vs. 0.5 mg L⫺1),
magnesium accumulation in tomato leaves and fruit was inhibited (153). Similarly, with blackgram
(Vigna mungo L.) grown in soil, accumulation of zinc in plants led to a suppression of magnesium,
calcium, and potassium in leaves (154). Bonnet et al. (155) also reported that zinc fertilization of
ryegrass  (Lolium  perenne L.)  lowered  magnesium  content  of  leaves, in  addition  to  lowering  the
eﬃciency of photosynthetic energy conversion, and elevating the activities of ascorbate peroxidase
and  superoxide  dismutase.  Conversely, pecan  (Carya  illinoinensis K.  Koch)  grown  under  zinc-
deﬁcient conditions had higher leaf magnesium than trees grown under zinc-suﬃcient conditions
(156). However, in nutrient ﬁlm-grown potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), increased levels of mag-
nesium fertilization (1.2 to 96.0 mg L⫺1) did not aﬀect zinc concentrations in tissues.

6.3.3.8 Phosphorus and Magnesium
Phosphate ions have a synergistic eﬀect on accumulation of magnesium in plants, and vice versa.
This phenomenon is associated with the ionic balance related to cation and anion uptake into plants
as well as the increased root growth sometimes observed with increased phosphorus fertilization.
For example, with hydroponically grown sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.), phosphorus accumula-
tion increased in tissues from 9.0 to 13.0 mg g⫺1 plant dry weight as magnesium concentrations in
nutrient solutions were increased from 0.0 to 240 mg L⫺1 (35). Likewise, increasing phosphorus fer-
tilization  increases  magnesium  accumulation, as  demonstrated  in  ﬁeld-grown  alfalfa  (Medicago
sativa L.) (157). The eﬀect of phosphorus fertilization increasing magnesium uptake has also been
documented in rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),
and corn (Zea mays L.) (158). Reinbott and Blevins (82,159) reported that phosphorus fertilization
of ﬁeld-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.) increased

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 154

154

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

leaf calcium and magnesium accumulation and concluded that proper phosphorus nutrition may be
more important than warm root temperatures in promoting magnesium and calcium accumulation,
particularly if soils have suboptimal phosphorus concentrations. Reinbott and Blevins (160) also
showed  a  positive  correlation  between  calcium  and  magnesium  accumulation  in  shoots  with
increased phosphorus fertilization of hydroponically grown squash (Cucurbita pepo L.).

6.3.3.9 Copper and Magnesium

Like other micronutrients, copper is a plant nutrient, which is required in such low concentrations
relative to the requirements for magnesium that high copper fertilization is more likely to induce
copper  toxicity  before  causing  magnesium  deﬁciency  symptoms.  However, some  studies  have
shown that copper may competitively inhibit magnesium accumulation in plants (161,162). In taro
(Colocasia  esculenta Schott), increasing  the  nutrient  solution  copper  concentrations  from  0.03 
to  0.16 mg  L⫺1, signiﬁcantly  decreased  the  accumulation  of  magnesium  in  leaves  from  5.5  to
4.4 mg g⫺1 dry weight (161). In a study (162) using young spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), where
copper concentrations in nutrient solutions were increased from 0.0 to 10.0 mg L⫺1, which is two
orders of magnitude greater than the copper concentrations used in the study conducted by Hill et
al. (2000), copper toxicity symptoms did occur, and there was a signiﬁcant suppression in magne-
sium  accumulation  in  the  leaves  and  roots  from  322  and  372 mg  kg⫺1 to  41  and  203 mg  kg⫺1,
respectively (162). However, the magnesium concentration reported in this study (162) is an order
of magnitude lower than what is found typically in most herbaceous plants (85). On the other hand,
eﬀects of magnesium fertilization on copper uptake are not documented, although one study (34)
indicated that increasing rates of magnesium fertilization did not signiﬁcantly reduce the uptake
and accumulation of copper.

6.3.3.10 Chloride and Magnesium
The eﬀects of chloride on magnesium accumulation in plants have been studied in relation to the
eﬀects of salinity on growth and nutrient accumulation. In many of these studies, it is diﬃcult to
separate the eﬀects of chloride from those of sodium ions; hence, many of the results show a depres-
sion of magnesium accumulation with increases in sodium chloride concentration in the root zone
(132–135). In grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), salinity from sodium chloride did not aﬀect magnesium
concentrations in leaves, trunk, or roots (163). With tomato, increased magnesium fertilization rates
did  not  increase  the  accumulation  of  chlorine  in  the  leaves, stems, or  roots  (37). With  soybean,
uptake of chloride by excised roots was low from magnesium chloride solutions but was enhanced
by the addition of potassium chloride (100).

6.3.3.11 Aluminum and Magnesium

Free aluminum in the soil solution inhibits root growth, which in turn will reduce ability of plants
to take up nutrients (164). Research with red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) indicated that magnesium
concentrations in roots and needles of seedlings were suppressed by exposure to ⬇ 400 µM alu-
minum in nutrient solutions (165,166). Increasing concentrations of free aluminum have also been
shown to reduce magnesium accumulation in taro (167), maize (Zea mays L.) (168,169), and wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) (170). Aluminum-induced magnesium deﬁciency may be one mechanism of
expression of aluminum toxicity in plants, and aluminum tolerance of plants may be related to the
capacity  of  plants  to  accumulate  magnesium  and  other  nutrients  in  the  presence  of  aluminum
(67,95,168,170–172).  Some  studies  (173)  have  shown  that  the  toxic  eﬀects  of  aluminum  were
reduced when magnesium was introduced into the nutrient solution and subsequently increased the
production  and  excretion  of  citrate  from  the  root  tips.  The  authors  (173)  hypothesized  that  the
citrate binds with free aluminum, forming nontoxic aluminum–citrate complexes. Keltjens (168)
also reported that aluminum chloride in solution culture restricted magnesium absorption by corn

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 155

Magnesium

155

but that aluminum citrate or organic complexes did not inhibit magnesium absorption and were not
phytotoxic.

Sensitivity  to  aluminum  toxicity  may  or  may  not  be  cultivar-speciﬁc.  In  a  study  (170)  with
wheat, diﬀerences in magnesium accumulation occurred for diﬀerent cultivars, with a signiﬁcantly
greater accumulation of magnesium in the leaves of the aluminum-tolerant ‘Atlas 66’ compared to
the aluminum-sensitive ‘Scout 66’ and increasing the magnesium concentration in nutrient solu-
tions  relative  to  aluminum  and  potassium  concentrations  increased  the  aluminum  tolerance  of
‘Scout 66’ (170). However, in another study (174) with aluminum-tolerant and aluminum-sensitive
corn cultivars, increasing concentrations of aluminum resulted in higher nutrient concentrations in
the shoots of aluminum-sensitive than in the aluminum-tolerant cultivar, probably the result of a
greater suppression of growth in the sensitive cultivar.

6.3.4 PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN ACCUMULATION
The uptake and accumulation of magnesium may change during diﬀerent stages of physiological
development. Knowledge of these changes is important in managing nutritional regimes for plant
growth and for sampling of plants to assess their nutritional status. In poinsettias, magnesium accu-
mulation was greatest from the period of ﬂower induction to the visible bud stage, but then accumu-
lation decreased during the growth phase of visible bud to anthesis (130). With cotton (Gossypium
hirsutum L.), maximum  daily  inﬂux  of  magnesium  into  roots  occurred  at  peak  bloom  (175).
Accumulation (net inﬂux) of magnesium in annual ryegrass (Lolium multiﬂorum Lam.) decreased
with increasing plant age (176,177). Similarly, magnesium uptake rates by tomato decreased from 68
to 17.5 µ eq g⫺1 fresh weight per day as the plants aged from 18 to 83 days (110). With anthurium
(Anthurium  andraeanum Lind.), changes  in  the  allocation  of  magnesium  to  diﬀerent  organs  with
increased plant age were attributed to transport of nutrients from lower leaves to the ﬂowers, result-
ing  in  a  lowering  of  magnesium  concentrations  in  the  lower  leaves  (178).  Tobacco  (Nicotiana
tabacum L.) showed decreasing concentrations of leaf magnesium from base to top of the plants over
the growing season, and stem magnesium concentrations also fell with plant age (179). Sadiq and
Hussain (180) attributed the decline in magnesium concentration in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)
plants to a dilution eﬀect from plant growth. However, Jiménez et al. (181) reported no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences  in  shoot-tissue  magnesium  concentrations  throughout  the  diﬀerent  growth  stages  of
diﬀerent soybean cultivars.

6.3.5 GENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN ACCUMULATION
Variation  in  magnesium  accumulation  might  occur  for  diﬀerent  cultivars  or  plant  selections
within a species. In a 2-year study with ﬁeld-grown tomato plants in an acid soil, magnesium con-
centration  of  leaves  was  signiﬁcantly  greater  in  cultivar  ‘Walter’ (1.1%)  than  in  ‘Better  Boy’
(0.9%) in a dry, warm year, but no diﬀerences (average 0.6%) occurred between the cultivars in
a wetter, cooler year that followed (182). Mullins and Burmester (183) noted that cotton cultivars
diﬀered  in  concentrations  of  magnesium  in  leaves  and  burs  under  nonirrigated  conditions.
Diﬀerences  in  magnesium  concentrations  in  diﬀerent  cultivars  of  Bermuda  grass  (Cynodon
dactylon Pers.) have been reported (184). Rosa et al. (185) suggested that variation in calcium,
magnesium, and sulfur among broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica Plenck) varieties justiﬁes
selection  of  a  particular  cultivar  to  increase  dietary  intake  of  these  elements.  Likewise, in
diﬀerent  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum L.)  (170)  and  barley  (Hordeum  vulgare L.)  (171)  cultivars,
aluminum tolerance was associated with the ability to take up and accumulate magnesium under
conditions of relatively high aluminum concentrations (1.35 to 16.20 mg L⫺1) in the rhizosphere.
Similar  studies  (94)  have  been  conducted  to  select  clonal  lines  of  tall  fescue  (Festuca  arundi-
nacea Schreb.), which display higher accumulation of magnesium, in an eﬀort to prevent mag-
nesium tetany in grazing animals.

6.4 CONCENTRATIONS OF MAGNESIUM IN PLANTS

6.4.1 MAGNESIUM CONSTITUENTS
Magnesium  is  present  in  the  plant  in  several  biochemical  forms.  In  studies  with  forage  grasses,
magnesium was measured in water-soluble, acetone-soluble, and insoluble constituents (18). These
forms are present in the phloem, xylem, cytoplasm (water-soluble fraction), chlorophyll (acetone-
soluble fraction), and cell wall constituents (insoluble fraction).

6.4.1.1 Distribution in Plants
The  quantity  of  magnesium  accumulated  will  diﬀer  for  various  plant  organs, with  a  tendency
toward greater allocation of magnesium in transpiring organs such as leaves and ﬂowers, rather
than the roots (186–188); however, this translocation to diﬀerent plant parts may be aﬀected by the
status of other elements in the plant (143,164,189). Similarly, the ability of magnesium to remo-
bilize and translocate out of a particular plant organ may vary among plant organs (186,187). In
cucumber, magnesium concentrations were seven times higher in the shoots (70 µmol g⫺1 fresh
weight)  than  in  the  roots  (10  µ mol  g⫺1 fresh  weight)  (190).  In  native  stands  of  13-year-old
Hooker’s  Banksia  (Banksia  hookeriana Meissn.), magnesium  was  distributed  to  diﬀerent  plant
organs  as  follows  (mg  g⫺1 dry  weight): 0.99  in  stems, 1.41  in  leaves, and  0.73  in  reproductive
structures, which account for 54, 21, and 25% of the total magnesium content, respectively (191).
In  walnut  (Juglans  regia L.), magnesium  remobilization  from  catkins  was  less  than  that  from
leaves (186,187). Additional studies (192) indicate that the magnesium concentration in the seeds
of several halophytes ranged from 0.22 to 0.90% for forbs and 0.07 to 0.97% for grasses (192). In
corn (Zea mays L.), less magnesium was translocated from the roots to the shoots for iron-deﬁcient
plants than with plants with suﬃcient iron (143). In a similar manner for hydroponically grown
tomatoes, increasing potassium concentrations of nutrient solutions resulted in decreased magne-
sium concentration in leaves and roots, but increased magnesium concentrations in fruits and seeds
(193).

Although magnesium accumulates to higher levels in aboveground organs than in belowground
organs, there may also be spatial diﬀerences in magnesium accumulation within a particular organ
(194). In corn leaves, magnesium concentration decreased from the leaf tip to the leaf base (194).
The  relative  distribution  of  magnesium  within  plants  may  be  altered  by  magnesium  fertilization
rates as well as the fertilization rates of other nutrients. Other environmental stresses, such as iron
deﬁciency, have also been shown to modify the spatial gradient of magnesium concentrations along
the leaf blade of corn (194).

6.4.1.2 Seasonal Variations

In perennial ryegrass (18) and walnut (186,187), magnesium concentration increased throughout the
growing season. For ﬁeld-grown soybeans, there was an indication that magnesium was remobilized
from stems and leaves and translocated to developing pods later in the growing season (195), since
stems and leaf tissue magnesium concentrations decreased from approximately 0.70% to less than
0.50% as pod magnesium concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.51%, indicating a remobilization
of  magnesium  from  vegetative  to  reproductive  tissue.  However, the  degrees  of  diﬀerences  were
aﬀected by soil type and irrigation frequency (195).

6.4.1.3 Physiological Aspects of Magnesium Allocation
Physiologically, certain stages of plant development, such as ﬂowering and fruiting, may make
plants  more  susceptible  to  magnesium  deﬁciencies.  In  camellia  (Camellia  sasanqua Thunb.

CRC_DK2972_Ch006.qxd  6/14/2006  7:04 AM  Page 157

Magnesium

157

‘Shishi Gashira’), magnesium deﬁciency may be expressed after ﬂowering, as the ﬁrst vegetative
ﬂush commences in the spring (56). This expression appears to be attributed to the large ﬂowers
of ‘Shishi Gashira’ acting as sinks for magnesium. After ﬂowering, when magnesium reserves in
the  plants  are  low, plants  may  be  markedly  susceptible  to  magnesium  deﬁciency  and  may
develop typical magnesium deﬁciency symptoms if suﬃcient magnesium is not available in the
soil for uptake. Similarly, in cucumber, magnesium concentration in leaves increased with leaf
age, until ﬂowering and fruiting, at which point concentrations increased in the younger leaves
(190). In grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), the magnesium concentration (10.1 mg/cluster) of ripening
berries of ‘Pinot Blanc,’ a cultivar that is susceptible to lime-induced chlorosis during ripening,
was  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  the  magnesium  concentration  (7.1 mg/cluster)  for  berries  of  the
lime-tolerant cultivar ‘Sauvignon Blanc’ (145). However, in blades and petioles, there were no
diﬀerences in magnesium concentrations (145). In other grape cultivars (‘Canadian Muscat’ and
‘Himrod’) that are susceptible to berry drop and rachis necrosis, spray applications of magne-
sium were shown to increase berry yield through the alleviation of rachis necrosis and berry drop
(196). A similar observation was noted on grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfady) trees by Fudge
(197). As fruit and seed development occurred, a depletion of magnesium from leaves near to the
fruits was apparent, as only the leaves in proximity to the fruits expressed magnesium deﬁciency
symptoms.

6.4.2 CRITICAL CONCENTRATIONS

6.4.2.1 Tissue Magnesium Concentration Associations with Crop Yields
The magnesium concentration of tissues considered as deﬁcient, suﬃcient, or toxic depends on
what growth parameter is being measured in the crops. In many food crops, classiﬁcation of nutri-
ent suﬃciency is based on harvestable yields and quality of the edible plant parts (198). In orna-
mental  plants, suﬃciency  values  are  based  on  plant  growth  rate  and  visual  quality  of  the
vegetative  and  reproductive  organs.  In  forestry, ratings  are  based  on  rate  of  growth  and  wood
quantity  and  quality.  For  example,
in  birch  (Betula  pendula Roth.)  seedlings, magnesium
suﬃciency levels in leaves were correlated with relative growth rate (36). Based on their studies,
maximum  growth  rate  was  correlated  with  a  mature  healthy  leaf  magnesium  concentration  of
0.14%, a  concentration  that  was  considered  deﬁcient  for  rough  lemon  (Citrus  jambhiri Lush.)
production (28). Austin et al. (199) reported that magnesium concentrations in taro (Colocasia
esculenta Schott)  varied  from  0.07  to  0.42%  with  hydroponically  grown  plants  and  noted  that
growth parameters (biomass, leaf area, nutrient concentrations) did not vary as the magnesium in
solution varied from 1.20 to 19.2 mg L⫺1. In corn, optimal leaf magnesium concentrations were
determined  to  range  between  0.13  and  0.18%  for  maximum  corn  yields  (198).  With  peach
(Prunus persica Batsch.), the critical concentration or marginal level of magnesium in leaves was
determined to be about 0.2% of the dry mass based on the appearance of symptoms of deﬁciency
but with no growth suppression at this concentration (200).

6.4.2.2 Tabulated Data of Concentrations by Crops

In most commercially grown crops, magnesium concentrations average between 0.1 and 0.5% on a
dry  weight  basis  (29).  However, total  magnesium  concentration  may  vary  considerably  between
diﬀerent plant families. The legumes (Leguminosae or Fabaceae) can have nearly double the mag-
nesium concentration as most cereal crops (201). Likewise, oil seed crops and root crops can also
contain high concentrations of magnesium (201). A tabulated description of magnesium concentra-
tions for diﬀerent crops is presented in Table 6.1.

6.5 ASSESSMENT OF MAGNESIUM IN SOILS

6.5.1 FORMS OF MAGNESIUM IN SOILS
Approximately 1.3, 4.7, and 4.3% of the earth’s continental upper layer, lower layer, and the ocean
crust is made up of magnesium, respectively (202). However, in surface soils, magnesium concen-
trations usually range from 0.03 to 0.84%, with sandy soils typically having the lowest magnesium
concentrations  (⬇ 0.05%), and  clay  soils  containing  the  highest  magnesium  concentrations
(⬇ 0.50%) (10,29). Like other metallic elements, the soil magnesium pool consists of three frac-
tions: nonexchangeable, exchangeable, and water-soluble fractions. The nonexchangeable fraction
consists of the magnesium present in the primary minerals and many of the secondary clay miner-
als (Table 6.2) (29). In many cases these compounds may be hydrated with one to several water
molecules. The exchangeable fraction may make up approximately 5% of the total magnesium in
the soil, accounting for 4 to 20% of the cation-exchange capacity of the soil (29). Magnesium con-
centrations in the soil solution typically range from 0.7 to 7.0 mM, but may be as high as 100 mM,
with  the  soil  solutions  of  acid  soils  generally  having  a  lower  magnesium  concentration  (about
2.0 mM) than soil solutions derived from neutral soils (about 5.0 mM) (29,203–207).

6.5.2 SODIUM ABSORPTION RATIO
Magnesium is also an important component in evaluating the sodium absorption ratio (SAR) of irri-
gation waters and soil extracts. The SAR is calculated as

SAR ⫽ (Na⫹)/兹(Ca2⫹ ⫹ Mg2⫹)/2

In this equation, the concentrations of sodium (Na⫹), calcium (Ca2⫹), and magnesium (Mg2⫹) ions
are  expressed  in  meq  L⫺1.  When  concentrations  of  magnesium, calcium, or  both  elements  are
increased, relative to sodium, the SAR decreases. Many soils in arid climates are aﬀected by SAR
in that as the SAR increases, the permeability of the soil decreases since the sodium reacts with clay,
causing soil particles to disperse resulting in reduced water penetration into the soil (208). In most
cases, a soil is considered sodic when the SAR ⬎ 13 (209). However, at lower SAR values, some
crops may still be susceptible to the adverse eﬀects of sodium on nutrient uptake rather than to the
physiochemical eﬀects on soil permeability.

6.5.3 SOIL TESTS
Several methods have been developed to extract the exchangeable magnesium fraction from soils.
When  preparing  soils  for  extractions, the  drying  temperatures  of  40  to  105⬚C  do  not  aﬀect  the
extractability of magnesium (210). In most soils, magnesium can be extracted with a solution con-
taining ammonium acetate (211–213), CaCl2 (210) or with water (214). However, for soils with a
low cation-exchange capacity, acidic extractions are recommended (215). For alkaline soils, a water
extraction is utilized (214). Another extraction method (AB-DTPA, ammonium bicarbonate-dieth-
yleneaminepentaacetate) is utilized for alkaline soils; however, this method is suitable only for the
extraction of sodium and potassium, since magnesium as well as calcium will react and precipitate
with the bicarbonate in the extraction reagent (216). In Sweden, soils are extracted with ammonium
lactate at pH 3.75 (10), and in Turkey, chemical extractions methods include various concentration
of hydrochloric acid in addition to the ammonium acetate procedure (212).

After  proper  extractions  are  performed, the  magnesium  concentration  of  solutions  can  be
quantiﬁed by ion-selective electrodes, ﬂame-plasma emission spectroscopy, or atomic absorption
spectroscopy (217). The wavelength used in atomic absorption is 285.2 nm. In the United States, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (218,219) guidelines indicate that magnesium concentra-
tions  of  samples  have  to  be  determined  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  (ICP)  spectrophotometry
according to methods described in EPA Method 200.7, by ICP-mass spectrometry in EPA Method
200.8 (218), or by atomic absorption method 7450 EPA 7-series (219).

6.5.4 TABULATED DATA ON MAGNESIUM CONTENTS IN SOILS

6.5.4.1 Soil Types

Considering surface soils, sandy soils typically have the lowest magnesium concentrations and clay
soils typically have the highest magnesium concentrations (193,220). Common soil types high in
magnesium include soils that are not leached heavily or soils in depressions where leached nutri-
ents  may  accumulate.  Leached  soils  such  as  lateritic  soils  and  podzols  tend  to  be  low  on 
magnesium (29). Soils derived from parent bedrock of dolomite or igneous rock tend to be high in
magnesium (29,221).

6.6 FERTILIZERS FOR MAGNESIUM

6.6.1 KINDS OF FERTILIZERS
Magnesium-containing  fertilizers  are  derived  from  the  mining  of  natural  mineral  deposits  or
through  synthetic  processing.  Organic  magnesium  sources  include  most  manures  (209).  The 
magnesium availability to plants from diﬀerent fertilizers will be dictated by the water solubility of
the compounds, release rates from fertilizer coatings (where applicable), and particle size, with the
ﬁner particles solubilizing more quickly than the coarser-grade fertilizers. Magnesium concentra-
tions and solubility characteristics for some common fertilizers are listed in Table 6.3.

6.6.2 EFFECTS OF FERTILIZERS ON PLANT GROWTH
Although the requirements for magnesium is low relative to other macronutrients such as nitrogen
(222), the eﬀect of magnesium fertilization on plant growth may vary with the form of magnesium
used and the fertilizer texture (coarseness) (223). Therefore, the type of magnesium fertilizer to use
will depend on variables such as the type of crop and the longevity of the production cycle. In stud-
ies with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the highest magnesium uptake occurred from fertilizers as
follows: magnesium  sulfate ⬎ potassium  magnesium  sulfate  (K2SO4.2MgSO4) ⬎ ground
dolomite ⬎ pelletized dolomite (224). Studies by Tayrien and Whitcomb (119,120,225) indicated
that the use of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide produced greater vegetative growth than

equivalent quantities of calcium and magnesium supplied with dolomitic limestone (calcium car-
bonate and magnesium carbonate intergrade). However, in studies with cotoneaster (Cotoneaster
dammeri C.K. Schneid), the greatest vegetative growth of roots and shoots occurred with the use of
dolomite rather than with combinations of other calcium and magnesium sources (109). In other
experiments  with  containerized  woody  ornamentals, the  use  of  calcium  and  magnesium  sulfates
resulted in equal or better quality plants than plants receiving the same amount of calcium and mag-
nesium in the carbonate form, regardless of the grade of dolomite (223). The eﬀects of powdered
dolomite compared to pelletized dolomite on plant quality varied with the rate of dolomite applica-
tion, plant type, and form of other nutrients used, but there tended to be a general trend of increased
plant  quality  with  powdered  dolomite  compared  to  pelletized  dolomite  at  low  fertilizer  rates
(2.97 kg dolomite m⫺3), but higher plant quality with pelletized compared to powdered dolomite at
higher fertilization rates (5.95 kg dolomite m⫺3). The diversity of growth eﬀects with diﬀerent fer-
tilizer types can be attributed to the diﬀerent solubilities of magnesium compounds and the coarse-
ness of the fertilizers. The more soluble and ﬁner the particle size of the fertilizers are, the more
quickly they will dissolve and be available for plant uptake, but also the more quickly magnesium
will leach from the root zone. Therefore, although quickly soluble fertilizer forms are suitable for
relatively short-term crops (a few weeks), they would not be suitable for long-term crops since fer-
tilizer might not be available in the later stages of crop development.

6.6.3 APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS
The primary goal is to have suﬃcient magnesium, relative to other nutrients, readily available for
plant uptake throughout crop development. The type and rate of magnesium to apply depends upon
the crop, soil type, and method of production (ﬁeld, container, or hydroponics). If plants are grown
hydroponically, a completely soluble form of magnesium would be required. For container-grown
nursery crops, Whitcomb (119,120) suggested injecting dissolved Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate)
into irrigation water at a rate to produce a calcium/magnesium ratio from 1:1 up to 5:1. In prelimi-
nary studies with juniper (Juniperus spp. L.), increased vegetative growth occurred when magne-
sium was supplied by applications of magnesium sulfate in the irrigation water versus equivalent
magnesium applications through the incorporation of ﬁne dolomitic lime into the planting media
(119–121). Obatolu (226) reported that magnesium deﬁciency resulted in a loss of yield and qual-
ity of tea (Camellia sinensis O. Kuntze) in Nigerian plantations. A spray of 30% magnesium oxide
corrected magnesium deﬁciency within 14 days and increased growth from 16 to 134%. Two appli-
cations of a 20% solution were required to correct deﬁciencies. A second application of the 30%
solution was toxic to the tea plants.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Sulfur (S) is unique in having changed within just a few years, from being viewed as an undesired
pollutant to being seen as a major nutrient limiting plant production in Western Europe. In East
Asia, where, under current legislative restrictions, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are expected to
increase further by 34% by 2030 (1), considerations of sulfur pollution are a major issue. Similarly
in Europe, sulfur is still associated with its once detrimental eﬀects on forests which peaked in the

183

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

1970s (2), and which gave this element the name ‘yellow poison.’ With Clean Air Acts coming into
force at the start of the 1980s, atmospheric sulfur depositions were reduced drastically and rapidly
in  Western  Europe, and  declined  further  in  the  1990s  after  the  political  transition  of  Eastern
European countries. In arable production, sulfur deﬁciency can be retraced to the beginning of the
1980s (3). Since then, severe sulfur deﬁciency has become the main nutrient disorder of agricultural
crops in Western Europe. It has been estimated that the worldwide sulfur fertilizer deﬁcit will reach
11 million tons per year by 2012, with Asia (6 million tons) and the Americas (2.3 million tons)
showing the highest shortage (4).

Severe sulfur deﬁciency not only reduces crop productivity and diminishes crop quality, but it also
aﬀects plant health and environmental quality (5). Yield and quality in relation to the sulfur nutritional
status for numerous crops are well described in the literature. In comparison, research in the ﬁeld of
interactions  between  sulfur  and  pests  and  diseases  is  relatively  new.  Related  studies  indicate  the 
signiﬁcance of the sulfur nutritional status for both beneﬁcial insects and pests.

Since the very early days of research on sulfur in the 1930s, signiﬁcant advances have been
made  in  the  ﬁeld  of  analysis  of  inorganic  and  organic  sulfur  compounds.  By  employing  genetic
approaches in life science research, signiﬁcant advances in the ﬁeld of sulfur nutrition, and in our
understanding  of  the  cross  talk  between  metabolic  pathways  involving  sulfur  and  interactions
between sulfur nutrition and biotic and abiotic stresses, can be expected in the future.

This chapter summarizes the current status of sulfur research with special attention to physio-

logical and agronomic aspects.

7.2 SULFUR IN PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Sulfur is an essential element for growth and physiological functioning of plants. The total sulfur
content  in  the  vegetative  parts  of  crops  varies  between  0.1  and  2%  of  the  dry  weight  (0.03  to
0.6 mmol  S g⫺1 dry  weight).  The  uptake  and  assimilation  of  sulfur  and  nitrogen  by  plants  are
strongly interrelated and dependent upon each other, and at adequate levels of sulfur supply the
organic N/S ratio is around 20:1 on a molar basis (6–9). In most plant species the major proportion
of  sulfur  (up  to  70%  of  the  total  S)  is  present  in  reduced  form  in  the  cysteine  and  methionine
residues of proteins. Additionally, plants contain a large variety of other organic sulfur compounds
such as thiols (glutathione; ∼1 to 2% of the total S) and sulfolipids (∼1 to 2% of the total S); some
species  contain  the  so-called  secondary  sulfur  compounds  such  as  alliins  and  glucosinolates
(7,8,10,11). Sulfur compounds are of great signiﬁcance in plant functioning, but are also of great
importance for food quality and the production of phyto-pharmaceuticals (8,12).

In general, plants utilize sulfate (S6⫹) taken up by the roots as a sulfur source for growth. Sulfate
is  actively  taken  up  across  the  plasma  membrane  of  the  root  cells, subsequently  loaded  into  the
xylem vessels and transported to the shoot by the transpiration stream (13–15). In the chloroplasts
of the shoot cells, sulfate is reduced to sulﬁde (S2⫺) prior to its assimilation into organic sulfur com-
pounds (16,17). Plants are also able to utilize foliarly absorbed sulfur gases; hence chronic atmos-
pheric sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulﬁde levels of 0.05 µL L⫺1 and higher, which occur in polluted
areas, contribute substantially to the plant’s sulfur nutrition (see below; 18–21).

The  sulfur  requirement  varies  strongly  between  species  and  it  may  ﬂuctuate  during  plant
growth. The sulfur requirement can be deﬁned as ‘the minimum rate of sulfur uptake and utiliza-
tion that is suﬃcient to obtain the maximum yield, quality, and  ﬁtness,’ which for crop plants is
equivalent to ‘the minimum content of sulfur in the plant associated with maximum yield’ and is
regularly expressed as kg S ha⫺1 in the harvested crop. In physiological terms the sulfur require-
ment is equivalent to the rate of sulfur uptake, reduction, and metabolism needed per gram plant
biomass produced over time and can be expressed as mol S g⫺1 plant day⫺1. The sulfur requirement
of a crop at various stages of development under speciﬁc growth conditions may be predicted by
upscaling the sulfur requirement in µmol S g⫺1 plant day⫺1 to mol S ha⫺1 day⫺1 by estimating the

crop biomass density per hectare (tons of plant biomass ha⫺1). When a plant is in the vegetative growth
period, the sulfur requirement (Srequirement, expressed as µmol S g⫺1 plant day⫺1) can be calculated as 
follows (11):

Srequirement

⫽ Scontent

⫻ RGR

where Scontent represents the total sulfur concentration of the plant (µmol g⫺1 plant biomass) and
RGR is the relative growth rate of the plant (g g⫺1 plant day⫺1). The RGR can be calculated by using
the following equation:

RGR ⫽ (ln W2

⫺ ln W1)/(t2

⫺ t1)

⫺ t1 the time inter-
where W1 and W2 are the total plant weight (g) at time t1 and t2, respectively, and t2
val (days) between harvests. In general, the sulfur requirement of diﬀerent crop species grown at
optimal nutrient supply and growth conditions ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 mmol g⫺1 plant dry weight
day⫺1.  Generally, the  major  proportion  of  the  sulfate  taken  up  is  reduced  and  metabolized  into
organic  compounds, which  are  essential  for  structural  growth.  However, in  some  plant  species, a
large proportion of sulfur is present as sulfate and in these cases, for structural growth, the organic
sulfur  content  may  be  a  better  parameter  for  the  calculation  of  the  sulfur  requirement  (see  also
Section 7.3.1.3).

7.2.1 UPTAKE, TRANSPORT, AND ASSIMILATION OF SULFATE
The  uptake  and  transport  of  sulfate  in  plants  is  mediated  by  sulfate  transporter  proteins  and  is
energy-dependent  (driven  by  a  proton  gradient  generated  by ATPases)  through  a  proton–sulfate
(presumably 3H⫹/SO4
2⫺) co-transport (14). Several sulfate transporters have been isolated and their
genes have been identiﬁed. Two classes of sulfate transporters have been identiﬁed: the so-called
‘high-  and  low-aﬃnity  sulfate  transporters,’ which  operate  ideally  at  sulfate  concentra-
tions ⬍ 0.1 mM and ⱖ 0.1 mM, respectively. According to their cellular and subcellular expression,
and possible functioning, the sulfate transporter gene family has been classiﬁed into as many as ﬁve
diﬀerent groups (15,22–24). Some groups are expressed exclusively in the roots or shoots, or in
both plant parts. Group 1 transporters are high-aﬃnity sulfate transporters and are involved in the
uptake of sulfate by the roots. Group 2 are vascular transporters and are low-aﬃnity sulfate trans-
porters. Group 3 is the so-called ‘leaf group;’ however, still little is known about the characteristics
of this group. Group 4 transporters may be involved in the transport of sulfate into the plastids prior
to its reduction, whereas the function of Group 5 sulfate transporters is not yet known. Regulation
and expression of the majority of sulfate transporters are controlled by the sulfur nutritional status of
the plants. A rapid decrease in root sulfate content upon sulfur deprivation is regularly accompanied
by a strongly enhanced expression of most sulfate transporter genes (up to 100-fold), accompanied
by a substantial enhanced sulfate uptake capacity. It is still questionable whether, and to what extent,
sulfate itself or metabolic products of sulfur assimilation (viz O-acetylserine, cysteine, glutathione)
act as signals in the regulation of sulfate uptake by the root and its transport to the shoot, and in the
expression of the sulfate tranporters involved (15,22–24).

The major proportion of the sulfate taken up by the roots is reduced to sulﬁde and subsequently
incorporated into cysteine, the precursor and the reduced sulfur donor for the synthesis of most other
organic sulfur compounds in plants (16,17,25–27). Even though root plastids contain all sulfate reduc-
tion enzymes, reduction predominantly takes place in the chloroplasts of the shoot. The reduction of
sulfate to sulﬁde occurs in three steps (Figure 7.1). First, sulfate is activated to adenosine 5⬘-phospho-
sulfate (APS) prior to its reduction, a reaction catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase. The aﬃnity of this enzyme
∼1 mM) and the in situ sulfate concentration in the chloroplast may be rate-
for sulfate is rather low (Km
limiting for sulfur reduction (7). Second, the activated sulfate (APS) is reduced by APS reductase to
sulﬁte, a reaction where glutathione (RSH; Figure 7.1) most likely functions as reductant (17,26). Third,
sulﬁte is reduced to sulﬁde by sulﬁte reductase with reduced ferredoxin as reductant. Sulﬁde is

subsequently incorporated into cysteine, catalyzed by O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase, with O-acetylserine
as substrate (Figure 7.1). The formation of O-acetylserine is catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase, and
together with O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase it is associated as an enzyme complex named cysteine synthase
(28,29). The synthesis of cysteine is a major reaction in the direct coupling between sulfur and nitro-
gen metabolism in the plant (6,9).

Sulfur reduction is highly regulated by the sulfur status of the plant. Adenosine phosphosulfate
reductase is the primary regulation point in the sulfate reduction pathway, since its activity is generally
the lowest of the enzymes of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway and this enzyme has a fast
turnover rate (16,17,26,27). Regulation may occur both by allosteric inhibition and by metabolite acti-
vation or repression of expression of the genes encoding the APS reductase. Both the expression and
activity of APS reductase change rapidly in response to sulfur starvation or exposure to reduced sulfur
compounds.  Sulﬁde, O-acetylserine, cysteine, or  glutathione  are  likely  regulators  of APS  reductase
(9,16,17,26). The remaining sulfate in plant tissue is predominantly present in the vacuole, since the
cytoplasmatic concentration of sulfate is kept rather constant. In general, the remobilization and redis-
tribution of the vacuolar sulfate reserves is a rather slow process. Under temporary sulfur-limitation
stress it may be even too low to keep pace with the growth of the plant, and therefore sulfur-deﬁcient
plants may still contain detectable levels of sulfate (13,15,22).

Cysteine is used as the reduced sulfur donor for the synthesis of methionine, the other major
sulfur-containing  amino  acid  present  in  plants, via  the  so-called  trans-sulfurylation  pathway
(30,31). Cysteine is also the direct precursor for the synthesis of various other compounds such as
glutathione, phytochelatins, and  secondary  sulfur  compounds  (12,32). The  sulﬁde  residue  of  the

cysteine moiety in proteins is furthermore of great importance in substrate binding of enzymes, in
metal–sulfur clusters in proteins (e.g., ferredoxins), and in regulatory proteins (e.g., thioredoxins).

7.2.1.1 Foliar Uptake and Metabolism of Sulfurous Gases

In rural areas the atmosphere generally contains only trace levels of sulfur gases. In areas with vol-
canic activity and in the vicinity of industry or bioindustry, high levels of sulfurous air pollutants
may occur. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is, in quantity and abundance, by far the most predominant sul-
furous air pollutant, but locally the atmosphere may also be polluted with high levels of hydrogen
sulﬁde (18,19,21). Occasionally the air may also be polluted with enhanced levels of organic sulfur
gases, viz carbonyl sulﬁde, methyl mercaptan, carbon disulﬁde, and dimethyl sulﬁde (DMS).

The impact of sulfurous air pollutants on crop plants appears to be ambiguous. Upon their foliar
uptake, SO2 and H2S may be directly metabolized, and despite their potential toxicity used as a sul-
fur source for growth (18–21). However, there is no clear-cut transition in the level or rate of metab-
olism of the absorbed sulfur gases and their phytotoxicity, and the physiological basis for the wide
variation in susceptibility between plants species and cultivars to atmospheric sulfur gases is still
largely unclear (18–21). These paradoxical eﬀects of atmospheric sulfur gases complicate the estab-
lishment of cause–eﬀect relationships of these air pollutants and their acceptable atmospheric con-
centrations in agro-ecosystems.

The  uptake  of  sulfurous  gases  predominantly  proceeds  via  the  stomata, since  the  cuticle  is
hardly permeable to these gases (33). The rate of uptake depends on the stomatal and the leaf inte-
rior (mesophyll) conductance toward these gases and their atmospheric concentration, and may be
described by Fick’s law for diﬀusion

Jgas (pmol cm⫺2 s⫺1) ⫽ ggas (cm s⫺1) ⫻ ⌬

gas (pmol cm⫺3)

where Jgas represents the gas uptake rate, ggas the diﬀusive conductance of the foliage representing
the resultant of the stomatal and mesophyll conductance to the gas, and ⌬
gas the gas concentration
gradient between the atmosphere and leaf interior (18,20,34). Over a wide range, there is a nearly
linear relationship between the uptake of SO2 and the atmospheric concentration. Stomatal con-
ductance is generally the limiting factor for uptake of SO2 by the foliage, whereas the mesophyll
conductance  toward  SO2 is  very  high  (18,20,35).  This  high  mesophyll  conductance  is  mainly
determined by chemical/physical factors, since the gas is highly soluble in the water of the meso-
phyll cells (in either apoplast or cytoplasm). Furthermore, the dissolved SO2 is rapidly hydrated
and  dissociated, yielding  bisulﬁte  and  sulﬁte  (SO2
2⫺)
(18,20). The latter compounds either directly enter the assimilatory sulfur reduction pathway (in
the chloroplast) or are enzymatically or nonenzymatically oxidized to sulfate in either apoplast or
cytoplasm (18,20). The sulfate formed may be reduced and subsequently assimilated or it is trans-
ferred  to  the  vacuole.  Even  at  relatively  low  atmospheric  levels, SO2 exposure  may  result  in
enhanced sulfur content of the foliage (18,20). The liberation of free H⫹ ions upon hydration of
SO2 or the sulfate formed from its oxidation is the basis of a possible acidiﬁcation of the water of
the  mesophyll  cells, in  case  the  buﬀering  capacity  is  not  suﬃcient.  Deﬁnitely, the  physical–
biochemical background of the phytotoxicity of SO2 can be ascribed to the negative consequences
of  acidiﬁcation  of  tissue/cells  upon  the  dissociation  of  the  SO2 in  the  aqueous  phase  of  the 
mesophyll  cells  or  the  direct  reaction  of  the  (bi)sulﬁte  formed  with  cellular  constituents  and
metabolites (18,20).

⫹ H2O → H⫹ ⫹ HSO3

The foliar uptake of H2S even appears to be directly dependent on the rate of its metabolism
into cysteine and subsequently into other sulfur compounds, a reaction catalyzed by O-acetylserine
(thiol)lyase (19,21). The basis for the phytotoxicity of H2S can be ascribed to a direct reaction of
sulﬁde  with  cellular  components;  for  instance, metallo-enzymes  appear  to  be  particularly
susceptible to sulﬁde, in a reaction similar to that of cyanide (18,19,36).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

The  foliage  of  plants  exposed  to  SO2 and  H2S  generally  contains  enhanced  thiol  levels, the
accumulation of which depends on the atmospheric level, though it is generally higher upon expo-
sure to H2S than exposure to SO2 at equal concentrations.

Changes in the size and composition of the thiol pool are likely the reﬂection of a slight over-
load of a reduced sulfur supply to the foliage. Apparently, the direct absorption of gaseous sulfur
compounds bypasses the regulation of the uptake of sulfate by the root and its assimilation in the
shoot so that the size and composition of the pool of thiol compounds is no longer strictly regulated.

7.2.2 MAJOR ORGANIC SULFUR COMPOUNDS
The sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine play a signiﬁcant role in the structure,
conformation, and function of proteins and enzymes in vegetative plant tissue, but high levels of
these amino acids may also be present in seed storage proteins (37). Cysteine is the sole amino acid
whose side-chain can form covalent bonds, and when incorporated into proteins, the thiol group of
a  cysteine  residue  can  be  oxidized, resulting  in  disulﬁde  bridges  with  other  cysteine  side-chains
(forming cystine) or linkage of polypeptides. Disulﬁde bridges make an important contribution to
the  structure  of  proteins.  An  impressive  example  for  the  relevance  of  disulﬁde  bridges  is  the
inﬂuence of the sulfur supply on the baking quality of bread-making wheat. Here, the elasticity and
resistance to extensibility are related to the concentration of sulfur-containing amino acids and glu-
tathione. First, it was shown in greenhouse studies that sulfur deﬁciency impairs the baking quality
of wheat (38–41). Then, the analysis of wheat samples from variety trials in England and Germany
revealed that decrease in the supply of sulfur aﬀected the baking quality, before crop productivity
was reduced (42,43). The sulfur content of the ﬂour was directly related to the baking quality with
each 0.1% of sulfur equalling 40 to 50 mL loaf volume. The data further revealed that a lack of
either protein or sulfur could be partly compensated for by increased concentration of the other.

The crude protein of wheat can be separated into albumins and globulins, and gluten, which
consist of gliadins and glutenins. The ﬁrst, albumins and globulins, are concentrated under the bran
and are thus present in higher concentrations in whole-grain ﬂours. Their concentration is directly
linked  to  the  thousand  grain  weight.  In  the  ﬂour, gluten  proteins  are  predominant  and  the
gliadin/glutenin ratio inﬂuences the structure of the gluten, rheological features of the dough, and
thus  the  baking  volume  (44).  Gliadins  are  associated  with  the  viscosity  and  extensibility, and
glutenins  with  the  elasticity  and  ﬁrmness  of  the  dough  (45).  Here, the  high-molecular-weight
(HMW)  glutenins  give  a  higher  proportion  of  the  resistance  of  the  gluten  than  low-molecular-
weight (LMW) glutenins (46). Sulfur deﬁciency gives rise to distinctly ﬁrmer and less extensible
doughs  (Figure  7.2).  Doughs  from  plants  adequately  supplied  with  sulfur  show  a  signiﬁcantly
higher extensibility and lower resistance than do doughs made of ﬂour with an insuﬃcient sulfur
supply (Figure 7.2). Sulfur-deﬁcient wheat has a lower albumin content, but higher HMW-glutenin
concentration and a higher HMW/LMW glutenin ratio (47).

Consequently the baking volume of sulfur-deﬁcient wheat is reduced signiﬁcantly. A compari-
son of British and German wheat varieties with similar characteristics for loaf volume and falling
number is given in Table 7.1. In the German classiﬁcation system, varieties C1 and C2 are used as
feed or as a source for starch. Varieties B3, B4, and B5 are suitable for baking but are usually mixed
with higher quality wheat. The highest bread-making qualities are in the A6–A9 varieties.

The results presented in Table 7.1 reveal that the quality of British and German varieties is sim-
ilar. It is relevant in this context that the British varieties gave the same results in the baking exper-
iment at lower protein concentrations than the German ones. The reason is that there was a higher
sulfur concentration and thus a smaller N/S ratio in the British varieties. This means that higher sul-
fur concentrations can partially compensate for a lack of wheat protein and vice versa.

Sulfur supply has been recognized as a major factor inﬂuencing protein quality for a long time
(48,49). Eppendorfer and Eggum (50,51), for instance, noted that the biological value of proteins in
potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) was reduced from 94 to 55 by sulfur deﬁciency at high N supply,
and  from  65  to  40  and  70  to  61  in  kale  (Brassica  oleracea var.  acephala DC)  and  ﬁeld  beans

(Vicia faba L.), respectively. Whereas the essential amino acid concentrations declined due to sulfur
deﬁciency, the content of amino acids of low nutritional value such as arginine, asparagine, and glu-
tamic acid increased (50, 51). Figure 7.3 shows the relationship between sulfur supply to curly cab-
bage  (Brassica  oleracea  var. sabellica L.), indicated  by  the  total  sulfur  concentration  in  fully
expanded younger leaves, and the cysteine and methionine concentration in leaf protein.

This example shows that a signiﬁcant relationship between sulfur supply and sulfur-containing
amino acids exists only under conditions of severe sulfur deﬁciency, where macroscopic symptoms
are visible. The corresponding threshold is below leaf sulfur levels of 0.4% total sulfur in the dry
matter of brassica species (52,53).

In  comparison, sulfur  fertilization  of  soybean  signiﬁcantly  increased  the  cystine, cysteine,

methionine, protein, and oil content of soybean grain (Table 7.2) (54).

The reason for these diﬀerent responses of vegetative and generative plant tissue to an increased
sulfur supply is that excess sulfur is accumulated in vegetative tissue as glutathione (see below) or as
sulfate in vacuoles; the cysteine pool is maintained homeostatically because of its cytotoxicity (55). In
comparison, the inﬂuence of sulfur supply on the seed protein content is related to the plant species.
In oilseed rape, for instance, which produces small seeds, the total protein content is more or less not
inﬂuenced by the sulfur supply (56). Species with larger seeds, which contain sulfur-rich proteins,
such as soybean, respond accordingly to changes in the sulfur supply (5).

The most abundant plant sulfolipid, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, is predominantly present in
leaves, where it comprises up to 3 to 6% of the total sulfur (10,57,58). This sulfolipid can occur in
plastid membranes and is probably involved in chloroplast functioning. The route of biosynthesis

of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol is still under investigation; in particular, the sulfur precursor for
the formation of the sulfoquinovose is not known, though from recent observations it is evident that
sulﬁte is the likely candidate (58).

Cysteine is the precursor for the tripeptide glutathione (γGluCysGly; GSH), a thiol compound
that is of great importance in plant functioning (32,59,60,61). Glutathione synthesis proceeds in a
two-step reaction. First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from cysteine and glutamate in an ATP-
dependent reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Equation 7.1). Second, glutathione
is  formed  in  an  ATP-dependent  reaction  from  γ-glutamylcysteine  and  glycine  (in  glutathione
homologs, β-alanine or serine) catalyzed by glutathione synthetase (Equation 7.2):

Glutathione and its homologs, for example, homoglutathione (γGluCysβAla) in Fabaceae and
hydroxymethylglutathione (γGluCysβSer) in Poaceae, are widely distributed in plant tissues in con-
centrations ranging from 0.1 to 3 mM. The glutathione content is closely related to the sulfur nutri-
tional status. In Table 7.3, the inﬂuence of the sulfur supply and sulfur status and the glutathione
content is summarized for diﬀerent crops. The possible signiﬁcance of the glutathione content for
plant health is discussed in Section 7.5.3.

Glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by an NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase,
and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) generally exceeds a value
of 7 (60–67). Glutathione fulﬁlls various roles in plant functioning. In sulfur metabolism, glutathione
functions as the reductant in the reduction of APS to sulﬁte (Figure 7.1). In crop plants, glutathione
is the major transport form of reduced sulfur between shoot and roots, and in the remobilization of
protein sulfur (e.g., during germination). Sulfate reduction occurs in the chloroplasts, and roots of
crop plants mostly depend for their reduced sulfur supply on shoot–root transfer of glutathione via
the phloem (59–61).

Selenium is present in most soils in various amounts, and its uptake, reduction, and assimila-
tion strongly interact with that of sulfur in plants. Glutathione appears to be directly involved in the
reduction  and  assimilation  of  selenite  into  selenocysteine  (68).  More  detailed  information  about
interactions between sulfur and other minerals is given in Section 7.2.4.

Glutathione provides plant protection against stress and a changing environment, viz air pollution,
drought, heavy metals, herbicides, low temperature, and UV-B radiation, by depressing or scavenging
the  formation  of  toxic  reactive  oxygen  species  such  as  superoxide, hydrogen  peroxide, and  lipid
hydroperoxides (61,69). The formation of free radicals is undoubtedly involved in the induction and
consequences  of  the  eﬀects  of  oxidative  and  environmental  stress  on  plants. The  potential  of  glu-
tathione to provide protection is related to the size of the glutathione pool, its oxidation–reduction state
(GSH/GSSG ratio) and the activity of glutathione reductase.

Plants may suﬀer from an array of natural or synthetic substances (xenobiotics). In general, these
have no direct nutritional value or signiﬁcance in metabolism, but may, at too high levels, negatively
aﬀect plant functioning (70–72). These compounds may originate from either natural (ﬁres, volcanic
eruptions, soil or rock erosion, biodegradation) or anthropogenic (air and soil pollution, herbicides)
sources. Depending on the source of pollution, namely air, water, or soil, plants have only limited
possibilities to avoid their accumulation to diminish potential toxic eﬀects. Xenobiotics (R-X) may
be detoxiﬁed in conjugation reactions with glutathione (GSH) catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione
S-transferase (70–72).

R-X ⫹ GSH ⇒ R-SG ⫹ X-H

The activity of glutathione S-transferase may be enhanced in the presence of various xenobi-
otics  via  induction  of  distinct  isoforms  of  the  enzyme.  Glutathione  S-transferases  have  great

signiﬁcance in herbicide detoxiﬁcation and tolerance in agriculture. The induction of the enzyme
by herbicide antidotes, the so-called safeners, is the decisive step for the induction of herbicide tol-
erance  in  many  crop  plants.  Under  normal  natural  conditions, glutathione  S-transferases  are
assumed to be involved in the detoxiﬁcation of lipid hydroperoxides, in the conjugation of endoge-
nous  metabolites, hormones, and  DNA  degradation  products, and  in  the  transport  of  ﬂavonoids.
However, oxidative  stress, plant-pathogen  infections, and  other  reactions, which  may  induce  the
formation  of  hydroperoxides, also  may  induce  glutathione  S-transferases.  For  instance, lipid
hydroperoxides (R-OOH) may be degraded by glutathione S-transferases:
R-OOH ⫹ 2GSH ⇒ R-OH ⫹ GSSG ⫹ H2O

Plants  need  minor  quantities  of  essential  heavy  metals  (zinc, copper, and  nickel)  for  growth.
However, plants may suﬀer from exposure to high toxic levels of these metals or other heavy met-
als, for example, cadmium, copper, lead, and mercury. Heavy metals elicit the formation of heavy-
metal-binding  ligands.  Among  the  various  classes  of  metal-binding  ligands, the  cysteine-rich
metallothioneins and phytochelatins are best characterized; the latter are the most abundant ligands
in plants (73–78). The metallothioneins are short gene-encoded polypeptides and may function in
copper homeostasis and plant tolerance. Phytochelatins are synthesized enzymatically by a constitu-
tive  phytochelatin  synthase  enzyme  and  they  may  play  a  role  in  heavy  metal  homeostasis  and
detoxiﬁcation by buﬀering the cytoplasmatic concentration of essential heavy metals, but direct evi-
dence is lacking so far. Upon formation, the phytochelatins only sequester a few heavy metals, for
instance cadmium. It is assumed that the cadmium–phytochelatin complex is transported into the
vacuole to immobilize the potentially toxic cadmium (79). The enzymatic synthesis of phytochelatins
involves a sequence of transpeptidation reactions with glutathione as the donor of γ-glutamyl-cysteine
(γGluCys) residues according to the following equation:

(γGluCys)nGly ⫹ (γGluCys)nGly ⇒ (γGluCys)n⫹1Gly ⫹ (γGluCys)n⫺1Gly

The number of γ-glutamyl-cysteine residues (γGluCys)n in phytochelatins ranges from 2 to 5, though
it may be as high as 11. In species containing glutathione homologs (see above), the C-terminal
amino acid glycine is replaced by β-alanine or serine (73–78). During phytochelatin synthesis, the
sulfur demand is enhanced (80) so that it may be speculated that the sulfur supply is linked to heavy
metal  uptake, translocation  of  phytochelatins  into  root  cell  vacuoles, and  ﬁnally  transport  to  the
shoot and expression of toxicity symptoms. The sulfur/metal ratio is obviously related to the length
of the phytochelatin (81), which might oﬀer a possibility to adapt to varying sulfur nutritional con-
ditions.  Hence, increasing  cadmium  stress  (10  µmol  Cd  in  the  nutrient  solution)  yielded  an
enhanced sulfate uptake by maize roots of 100%, whereby this eﬀect was associated with decreased
sulfate  and  glutathione  contents  and  increased  phytochelatin  concentrations  (81). The  studies  of
Raab et al. (82) revealed that 13% of arsenic was bound in phytochelatin complexes, whereas the
rest occurred as nonbound inorganic compounds.

7.2.3 SECONDARY SULFUR COMPOUNDS
There are more than 100,000 known secondary plant compounds, and for only a limited number of
them are the biochemical pathways, functions, and nutritional and medicinal signiﬁcance known (84).
Detailed overviews of the biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis of the sulfur-containing
secondary metabolites, glucosinolates and alliins, are provided by Halkier (84) and Lancaster and
Boland  (85).  Bioactive  secondary  plant  compounds  comprise  various  substances  such  as
carotenoids, phytosterols, glucosinolates, ﬂavonoids, phenolic acids, protease inhibitors, monoter-
penes, phyto-estrogens, sulﬁdes, chlorophylls, and roughages (87). Often, secondary metabolites
are accumulated in plant tissues and concentrations of 1 to 3% dry weight have been determined
(88).  Secondary  compounds  in  plants  usually  have  a  pharmacological  eﬀect  on  humans  (87).
Therefore, secondary  metabolites  contribute  signiﬁcantly  to  food  quality, either  as  nutritives  or

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 193

Sulfur

193

antinutritives.  Plants  synthesize  a  great  array  of  secondary  metabolites  as  they  are  physically
immobile (88), and the presence of secondary compounds may give either repellent or attractant
properties.

The bioactive components in medicinal plants comprise the whole range of secondary metabo-
lites and crop-speciﬁc cultivation strategies, which include fertilization, harvesting, and processing
techniques, and which are required for producing a consistently high level of bioactive constituents.
Ensuring a consistently high quality of the raw materials can be a problem, particularly if the active
agent is unstable and decomposes after harvesting of the plant material, as is true for many sec-
ondary metabolites such as the sulfur-containing alliins and glucosinolates (89).

Glucosinolates are characteristic compounds of at least 15 dicotyledonous families. Of these,
the Brassicaceae are the most important agricultural crops. Glucosinolates act as attractants, repel-
lents, insecticides, fungicides, and antimicrobial protectors. The principal structure of a glucosino-
late is given in Figure 7.4.

There are about 80 diﬀerent glucosinolates, which consist of glucose, a sulfur-containing group
with an aglucon rest, and a sulfate group (87). Alkenyl glucosinolates such as progoitrin and glu-
conapin have an aliphatic aglucon rest, whereas indole glucosinolates such as glucobrassicin and 
4-hydroxyglucobrassicin  in  rape  (Brassica  napus L.)  have  an  aromatic  aglucon  rest  (Figure  7.4).
Additional information about the characteristics of glucosinolate side-chains is given by Underhill
(91), Larsen (92), and Bjerg et al. (93).

Glucosinolates are generally hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase, which is present in all glu-
cosinolate-containing plant parts. Bones and Rossiter (94) provided basic information about the bio-
chemistry of the myrosinase–glucosinolate system. A proposed pathway for the recyclization of sulfur
(and N) under conditions of severe sulfur deﬁciency is described by Schnug and Haneklaus (53).

The degradation of glucosinolates results in the so-called mustard oils, which are responsible
for smell, taste, and biological eﬀect. Glucosinolates are vacuolar defense compounds (95) of qual-
itative  value  (96)  and  are  eﬀective  against  generalist  insects  at  low  tissue  concentrations  (97).
Isothiocyanates, the  breakdown  products  after  enzymatic  cleavage  of  glucosinolates, may  retard
multiplication of spores but do not hamper growth of fungal mycelium (98), and fungi may over-
come the glucosinolate–myrosinase system eﬃciently (99,100).

The inﬂuence of the sulfur nutritional status on the content of glucosinolates and other sulfur-
containing secondary metabolites, which are related to nutritional and pharmaceutical quality, is
shown in Table 7.4.

Generally, nitrogen fertilization reduces the glucosinolate content (104). However, under ﬁeld
conditions the eﬀect of nitrogen fertilization on glucosinolate content varies substantially between
seasons (105). Schnug (103) noted a distinct interaction between nitrogen and sulfur fertilization
when nitrogen was supplied insuﬃciently, whereby the alkenyl, but not the indole, glucosinolate
content in seeds of rape increased at higher nitrogen and sulfur rates. Kim et al. (106) also showed
that nitrogen fertilization increased the alkenyl-glucosinolates, gluconapin, and glucobrassicanapin
in particular, in rape.

More  than  80%  of  the  total  sulfur  in  Allium species  is  present  in  secondary  compounds. 
Allium species contain four S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides, namely S-1-propenyl-, S-2-propenyl-,

S-methyl- and S-propyl-L-cysteine sulfoxides (107). Iso-alliin is the main form in onions, whereas
alliin  is  the  predominant  form  in  garlic  (108)  (Figure  7.5). Alliins  supposedly  contribute  to  the
defense of plants against pests and diseases. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed a bacterici-
dal eﬀect against various plant pathogens (109).

The characteristic ﬂavor of Allium species is caused after the enzyme alliinase hydrolyzes cys-
teine sulfoxides to form pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfur-containing volatiles. In the intact cell, alliin
and related cysteine sulfoxides are located in the cytoplasm, whereas the C-S lyase enzyme alliinase
is localized in the vacuole (110). Disruption of the cell releases the enzyme, which causes subse-
quent  α,β-elimination  of  the  sulfoxides, ultimately  giving  rise  to  volatile  and  odorous  LMW
organosulfur compounds (111). The cysteine sulfoxide content of Allium species is an important
quality parameter with regard to sensory features, since it determines the taste and sharpness.

Alliin acts as an antioxidant by activating glutathione enzymes and is regarded as having an
anticarcinogenic and antimicrobial eﬀect (86). On average, 21% of sulfur, but only 0.9% of nitro-
gen, are present as (iso)alliin in onion bulbs at the start of bulb growth (101). The ratio between 
protein-S and sulfur in secondary metabolites of the Allium species is, at between 1:4 and 1:6, much
wider  than  in  members  of  the  Brassica family  (between  1:0.3  and  1:2).  The  reason  for  this 

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 195

Sulfur

195

diﬀerence is supposedly the fact that glucosinolates may be reutilized under conditions of sulfur
deﬁciency whereas alliins are inert end products. Interactions between nitrogen and sulfur supply
exist in such a way that nitrogen and sulfur fertilization has been shown to decrease total sulfur and
nitrogen concentration, respectively, in onion (101).

7.2.4 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SULFUR AND OTHER MINERALS
Interactions between sulfur and other minerals may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence crop quality parameters
(5,113,114). Sulfur and nitrogen show strong interactions in their nutritional eﬀects on crop growth
and quality due to their mutual occurrence in amino acids and proteins (see Section 7.2.3). Further
examples of nitrogen–sulfur interactions that are not mentioned in previous sections of this chapter
are shown below.

7.2.4.1 Nitrogen–Sulfur Interactions
Under conditions of sulfur starvation, sulfur deﬁciency symptoms are expressed moderately at low
nitrogen levels but extremely with a high nitrogen supply. This eﬀect explains the enhancement of
sulfur deﬁciency symptoms in the ﬁeld after nitrogen dressings (114). The question of why sulfur
deﬁciency symptoms are more pronounced at high nitrogen levels is, however, still unanswered. For
experimentation, these results are relevant as the adjustment of the nitrogen and sulfur nutritional
status of plants is essential before any hypothesis on the eﬀect of a nitrogen or sulfur treatment on
plant parameters can be stated or proved.

The use of the nitrogen/sulfur ratio as a diagnostic criterion is problematic because the same
ratio can be obtained at totally diﬀerent concentration levels in the tissue. Surplus of one element
may therefore be interpreted falsely as a deﬁciency of the other (see Section 7.3.1.3). Clear rela-
tionships  between  nitrogen/sulfur  ratios  and  yield  occur  only  in  ranges  of  extreme  ratios.  Such
ratios may be produced in pot trials but do not occur under ﬁeld conditions. The eﬀect of increas-
ing  nitrogen  and  sulfur  supply  on  crop  seed  yield  with  increasing  nitrogen  supply  is  more  pro-
nounced with protein than with carbohydrate crops (Table 7.5).

FIGURE 7.6 Nitrate concentrations in the dry matter of lettuce in relation to the sulfur nutritional status of
the  plants.  (From  Schnug, E., in  Sulphur  Metabolism  in  Higher  Plants: Molecular, Ecophysiological  and
Nutritional Aspects, Backhuys Publishers, Leiden, 1997, pp. 109–130.)

Changes in the nitrogen supply aﬀect the sulfur demand of plants and vice versa. Under condi-
tions of sulfur deﬁciency, the utilization of nitrogen will be reduced and consequently nonprotein
nitrogen compounds, including nitrate, accumulate in the plant tissue (Figure 7.6) (5,112).

The antagonistic relationship between sulfur supply and nitrate content exists in the range of
severe sulfur deﬁciency, when macroscopic symptoms are visible. The higher the nitrogen level in
the plants, the stronger the eﬀect on the nitrate content will be. Thus, an adequate sulfur supply is
vital for minimizing undesired enrichment with nitrate.

Photosynthesis  and  growth  of  pecan  (Carya  illinoinensis Koch)  increased  with  N  supply  in
relation to the nitrogen/sulfur ratio in pecan leaves (115). Both parameters were, however, reduced
when  combined  leaf  nitrogen  and  sulfur  concentrations  of  ⬍35  mg  g⫺1 nitrogen and  3.7 mg  g⫺1
sulfur were noted (115).

The initial supply of a crop with nitrogen and sulfur is decisive for its inﬂuence on the glucosi-
nolate content, probably due to physiological or root-morphological reasons (103). Nitrogen fertil-
ization  to  oilseed  rape  insuﬃciently  supplied  with  nitrogen  and  sulfur  will  lead  to  decreasing
glucosinolate concentrations because the demand of an increasing sink due to increasing numbers
of  seeds  will  not  be  met  by  the  limited  sulfur  source.  Only  if  the  rooting  depth  or  density  is
enhanced by the nitrogen supply, which increases the plant-available sulfur pool in the soil, does
the  glucosinolate  content  increase  too.  Higher  glucosinolate  concentrations  in  seeds  can  also  be
expected after nitrogen applications to crops with a demand for nitrogen but adequate sulfur supply
due to the increased biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids, which are precursors of glu-
cosinolates. In the case of a crop already suﬃciently supplied with nitrogen, there is no evidence
for any speciﬁc nitrogen–sulfur interactions on the glucosinolate content (5,116).

In general, no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of nitrogen fertilization on the alliin content has been found
for onions (Allium cepa L.) and garlic (Allium sativum L.), but there is a tendency that a higher nitro-
gen supply results in a decreased alliin content (101). In comparison, an increasing sulfur supply has
been related to an increasing alliin content in leaves and bulbs of both crops. There were also inter-
actions between nitrogen and sulfur in such a way that the total sulfur content of onion leaves was
correlated  highly  with  nitrogen  fertilization: the  sulfur  concentration  of  leaves  decreased  with
increasing N fertilization, and the total nitrogen concentration of onion bulbs decreased with increas-
ing sulfur fertilization. The same observations were made by Freeman and Mossadeghi (117) for gar-
lic plants, where the nitrogen concentration decreased from 4.05 to 2.93% with sulfur fertilization,

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 197

197

and by Randle et al. (118), who reported decreasing total bulb sulfur concentrations in response to
increasing nitrogen fertilization.

7.2.4.2 Interactions between Sulfur and Micronutrients
Owing to antagonistic eﬀects, sulfur fertilization reduces the uptake of boron and molybdenum. In
soils with a marginal plant-available concentration of these two plant nutrients, sulfur fertilization
may induce boron or molybdenum deﬁciency, particularly on coarse-textured sites where brassica
crops are grown intensely in the crop rotation (119). In comparison, sulfur fertilization is an eﬃcient
tool to reduce the selenium, molybdenum, arsenic, bromine, and antimony uptake on contaminated
sites. The inﬂuence of elemental sulfur applications on the concentration of trace elements of fully
developed leaves of nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) was tested on two sites in northern Germany
(120). The results of this study reveal a signiﬁcantly increased uptake of copper, manganese, cobalt,
nickel, and cadmium, with increasing levels of sulfur. This increased uptake was caused by a higher
availability  of  these  elements  due  to  the  acidifying  eﬀect  of  elemental  sulfur. At  the  same  time,
antagonistic eﬀects were noted for arsenic, boron, selenium, and molybdenum in relation to the soil
type.

The enzyme sulﬁte oxidase is a molybdo-enzyme, which converts sulﬁte into sulfate (121) and
is thus important for sulfate reduction and assimilation in plants (see Figure 7.1). Stout and Meagher
(122) have shown that the sulfate supply inﬂuences molybdenum uptake. Sulfate–molybdate antag-
onism can be observed at the soil–root interface and within the plant, as an increasing sulfur supply
results in lower molybdenum concentrations in the tissues (123). The signiﬁcance of sulfate–molybdate
antagonism in agriculture is described comprehensively by Macleod et al. (124).

Selenium, like molybdenum, is chemically similar to sulfur. Comprehensive reviews about inter-
actions  between  sulfate  transporters  and  sulfur  assimilation  enzymes, and  selenium–molybdenum
uptake  and  metabolism, are  given  by Terry  et  al.  (125)  and  Kaiser  et  al.  (126). Accumulation  of
glutathione due to elevated levels of sulfate in the soil and SO2/H2S in the air was reduced drastically
in  spinach  (Spinacia  oleracea L.)  leaf  discs  by  selenate  amendments  (127).  In  those  studies  the
uptake of sulfur was not inﬂuenced by the selenate treatment. Bosma et al. (128) suggested that
selenate decreases sulfate reduction due to antagonistic eﬀects during plant uptake, in combination
with a rapid turnover of glutathione. An increasing sulfate supply gives higher sulfate concentrations
in the plant tissue, so that the competition between sulfur and selenium for the enzymes of the sulfur
assimilation pathway will ﬁnally result in less synthesis of selenoamino acids (129).

This antagonistic eﬀect is of no practical signiﬁcance on seleniferous soils, but it could be relevant
on deﬁcient and marginal sites (130). Field experiments with combined sulfur and selenium applica-
tions  to  grass-clover  pastures, on  selenium-deﬁcient  and  high-selenium  sites  revealed  that  selenium
concentrations in the diﬀerent botanical species showed distinct diﬀerences in relation to the site (130).
On the high-selenium site, sulfur fertilization signiﬁcantly decreased the selenium concentra-
tion in pasture. Spencer (130) attributed this action to a dilution eﬀect, as the total selenium content
remained constant. Studies on the pungency of onion bulbs in relation to the sulfur supply revealed
that although sulfur content was increased at elevated selenium levels, the pungency was reduced
(131). Kopsell and Randell (131) proposed that selenium had an impact on the biosynthetic path-
way of ﬂavor precursors.

A  synergistic  eﬀect  of  sulfur  and  selenium  on  the  shoot  sulfur  concentration  was  noted  for
hydroponically grown barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). With increasing sele-
nium  concentrations  in  the  solution, a  steep  increase  in  the  sulfur  concentration  of  the  shoots
occurred even with a low sulfur supply (132).

Sulfur and phosphorus interactions in plants are closely related to plant species, because of the
diﬀerent root morphologies and nutrient demands of diﬀerent species (133). A synergistic eﬀect of sul-
fur and phosphorus on crop yield occurred for sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), maize (Zea mays L.),
wheat (Triticum  aestivum L.), and mustard (Brassica spp. L.) (134–137). A synergistic relationship

between  sulfur  and  potassium, which  enhances  crop  productivity  and  quality, was  determined  in 
several studies (138–140).

7.3 SULFUR IN PLANT NUTRITION

7.3.1 DIAGNOSIS OF SULFUR NUTRITIONAL STATUS

7.3.1.1 Symptomatology of Single Plants
Visual diagnosis of sulfur deﬁciency in production ﬁelds requires adequate expertise and needs to
involve soil or plant analysis (141). The literature describes symptoms of sulfur deﬁciency as being
less speciﬁc and more diﬃcult to identify than other nutrient deﬁciency symptoms (142–145). The
symptomatology of sulfur deﬁciency is very complex and shows some very unique features. In this
section, the basic diﬀerences in sulfur deﬁciency symptoms of species in the Gramineae represen-
tative of monocotyledonous, and species in the Cruciferae and Chenopodiaceae representative of
dicotyledonous crops will be given for individual plants and on a ﬁeld scale.

When  grown  side  by  side  and  under  conditions  of  sulfur  starvation, crops  begin  to  develop
sulfur  deﬁciency  symptoms  in  the  order  of  oilseed  rape  (canola), followed  by  potato, sugar  beet
(Beta  vulgaris L.), beans  (Phaseolus  vulgaris L.), peas  (Pisum  sativum L.), cereals, and  ﬁnally
maize. The total sulfur concentration in tissue corresponding to the  ﬁrst appearance of deﬁciency
symptoms is highest in oilseed rape (3.5 mg g⫺1 S), and lowest in the Gramineae (1.2 mg g⫺1 S).
Potato and sugar beet show symptoms at higher concentrations (2.1 to 1.7 mg g⫺1 S) than beans or
peas (1 to 1.2 mg g⫺1 S).

Brassica species, such as oilseed rape, develop the most distinctive expression of symptoms of
any crop deﬁcient in sulfur. The symptoms are very speciﬁc and thus are a reliable guide to sulfur
deﬁciency. There is no diﬀerence in the symptomatology of sulfur deﬁciency in high and low glu-
cosinolate-containing varieties (103). The symptomatology of sulfur deﬁciency in brassica crops is
characteristic during the whole vegetation period and is described below for speciﬁc growth stages
according to the BBCH scale (146). Symptoms generally apply to dicotyledonous plants, except
when speciﬁc variations are mentioned in the text. Colored guides of sulfur deﬁciency symptoms
are provided by Bergmann (143) and Schnug and Haneklaus (53,114,147).

Even before winter, during the early growth of oilseed rape, leaves may start to develop vis-
ible symptoms of sulfur deﬁciency. As sulfur is fairly immobile within the plant (13), symptoms
always show up in the youngest leaves. Though the plants are still small, symptoms can cover
the entire plant. Sulfur fertilization before or at sowing will ensure a suﬃcient sulfur supply, par-
ticularly  on  light, sandy  soils, and  will  promote  the  natural  resistance  of  plants  against  fungal
diseases (148).

Oilseed rape plants suﬀering from severe sulfur deﬁciency show a characteristic marbling of the
leaves. Leaves begin to develop chlorosis (149–154), which starts from one edge of the leaves and
spreads over intercostal areas; however, the zones along the veins always remain green (103,155).
The reason for the green areas around the veins is most likely the reduced intercellular space in that
part of the leaf tissue, resulting in shorter transport distances and a more eﬀective transport of sul-
fate. Sulfur-deﬁcient potato leaves show the same typical color pattern and veining as oilseed rape,
whereas sugar beet, peas, and beans simply begin to develop chlorosis evenly spread over the leaf
without any veining (156,157). A comparative evaluation of crop-speciﬁc, severe sulfur deﬁciency
symptoms is given in Figure 7.7.

Chlorosis  very  rarely  turns  into  necrosis  (103,157)  as  it  does  with  nitrogen  and  magnesium
deﬁciencies, and  is  an  important  criterion  for  diﬀerential  diagnosis.  Even  under  conditions  of
extreme sulfur deﬁciency, an oilseed rape plant will not wither. The intensity of sulfur deﬁciency
symptoms of leaves depends on the nitrogen supply of the plants (see Section 7.2.4.1). In general,
a high nitrogen supply promotes the expression of sulfur deﬁciency symptoms and vice versa (158).

oilseed rape plants (Brassica napus L.) (from left to right). (For a color presentation of this figure, see the
accompanying compact disc.)

A characteristic secondary symptom of severe sulfur deﬁciency is a reddish-purple color due to
the enrichment of anthocyanins in the chlorotic parts of brassica leaves (Figure 7.8). Under ﬁeld
conditions, the formation of anthocyanins starts 4 to 7 days after chlorosis. The phenomenon is ini-
tialized by the enrichment of carbohydrates in the cells after the inhibition of protein metabolism.
Plants  detoxify  the  accumulated  carbohydrates  as  anthocyanates, which  result  from  the  reaction
with  cell-borne  ﬂavonols  to  avoid  physiological  disorders  (159–165).  Many  other  nutrient
deﬁciencies are also accompanied by formation of anthocyanins, which therefore is a less speciﬁc
indicator for sulfur deﬁciency.

In particular, leaves which are not fully expanded produce spoon-like deformations when struck
by sulfur deﬁciency (Figure 7.8). The reason for this is a reduced cell growth rate in the chlorotic
areas along the edge of the leaves, while normal cell growth continues in the green areas along the
veins, so that sulfur-deﬁcient leaves appear to be more succulent. The grade of the deformation is
stronger the less expanded the leaf is when the plant is struck by sulfur deﬁciency. Marbling, defor-
mations, and anthocyanin accumulation can be detected up to the most recently developed small
leaves inserted in forks of branches (Figure 7.8).

FIGURE 7.9 White ﬂowering (left) and morphological changes of petals (right) of sulfur-deﬁcient oilseed
rape (Brassica napus L.). (For a color presentation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

The higher succulence of sulfur-deﬁcient plants (143,166) was suspected to be caused by enhanced
chloride uptake due to an insuﬃcient sulfate supply (159). However, with an increase of chloride con-
centrations by 0.4 mg Cl g⫺1 on account of a decrease of sulfur concentrations by 1 mg g⫺1 in leaves,
this  eﬀect  seems  to  be  too  small  to  justify  the  hypothesis  (103).  More  likely, the  above-explained
mechanical eﬀects of distortion, together with cell wall thickening, cause the appearance of increased
succulence due to the accumulation of starch and hemicellulose (167).

During ﬂowering of oilseed rape, sulfur deﬁciency causes one of the most impressive symptoms
of nutrient deﬁciency: the ‘white blooming’ of oilseed rape (Figure 7.9). The white color presumably
develops from an overload of carbohydrates in the cells of the petals caused by disorders in protein
metabolism, which ﬁnally ends up in the formation of colorless leuco-anthocyanins (168). As with
anthocyanins in leaves, the symptoms develop most strongly during periods of high photosynthetic
activity.  Beside  the  remarkable  modiﬁcation  in  color, size, and  shape  of  oilseed  rape, the  petals
change  too  (Figure  7.9).  The  petals  of  sulfur-deﬁcient  oilseed  rape  ﬂowers  are  smaller  and  oval
shaped, compared with the larger and rounder shape of plants without sulfur-deﬁciency symptoms
(169). The  degree  of  morphological  changes, form, and  color, are  reinforced  by  the  strength  and
duration  of  severe  sulfur  deﬁciency  (53).  The  fertility  of  ﬂowers  of  sulfur-deﬁcient  oilseed  rape
plants is not inhibited. However, the ability to attract honeybees may be diminished and can be of
great importance for the yield of nonrestored hybrids, which need pollination by insect vectors (169).
The strongest yield component aﬀected by sulfur deﬁciency in oilseed rape is the number of
seeds per pod, which is signiﬁcantly reduced (103). As described earlier for leaves, the branches and
pods of S-deﬁcient plants are often red or purple colored due to the accumulation of anthocyanins
(Figure 7.10). Extremely low numbers of seeds per pod, in some cases even seedless ‘rubber pods,’
are characteristic symptoms of extreme sulfur deﬁciency (Figure 7.10).

7.3.1.2 Symptomatology of Monocots
The symptoms in gramineous crops such as cereals and corn are less speciﬁc than in cruciferous
crops. In early growth stages, plants remain smaller and stunted and show a lighter color than plants
without symptoms (170). The general chlorosis is often accompanied by light green stripes along
the veins (Figure 7.11) (170–172). Leaves become narrower and shorter than normal (173).

There is no morphological deformation to observe, and usually no accumulation of anthocyanins
either. Although the symptoms are very unspeciﬁc and are easily mistaken for symptoms of nitrogen
deﬁciency, their speciﬁc pattern in ﬁelds provides good evidence for sulfur deﬁciency. Owing to an

early reduction of fertile ﬂowers per head, sulfur-deﬁcient cereals are characterized by a reduced num-
ber of kernels per head, which alone, however, is not conclusive evidence for sulfur deﬁciency (174).

7.3.1.3 Sulfur Deficiency Symptoms on a Field Scale
Some  characteristic  features  in  the  appearance  of  ﬁelds  can  provide  early  evidence  of  sulfur
deﬁciency.  Sulfur  deﬁciency  develops  ﬁrst  on  the  light-textured  sections  of  a  ﬁeld.  From  above,
these areas appear in an early oilseed rape crop as irregularly shaped plots with a lighter green color

(wash  outs).  The  irregular  shape  distinguishes  the  phenomenon  from  the  regular  shape  of  areas
caused  by  nitrogen  deﬁciency, which  usually  originates  from  inaccurate  fertilizer  application
(Figure 7.12). Owing to frequent soil compaction and limited root growth, sulfur deﬁciency devel-
ops ﬁrst along the headlands and tramlines or otherwise compacted areas of a ﬁeld.

The appearance of sulfur-deﬁcient oilseed rape ﬁelds is more obvious at the beginning of bloom-
ing;  white  ﬂowers  of  oilseed  rape  are  distinctively  smaller  and  therefore  much  more  of  the  green
undercover of the crop shines through the canopy of the crop. Another very characteristic indicator of
a  sulfur-deﬁcient  site  is  the  so-called  second  ﬂowering  of  the  oilseed  rape  crop.  Even  if  a  sulfur-
deﬁcient crop has ﬁnished ﬂowering, it may come back to full bloom if suﬃcient sulfur is supplied.
The typical situation for this action comes when a wet and rainy spring season up until the end of
blooming is followed suddenly by warm and dry weather. During the wet period precipitation, water,
which has only one-hundredth to one-tenth the sulfur concentrations of the entire soil solution, dilutes
or leaches the sulfate from the rooting area of the plants, so that ﬁnally plants are under the condition
of sulfur starvation. With the beginning of warmer weather, evaporation increases and sulfur-rich sub-
soil water becomes available to the plants and causes the second ﬂowering of the crop. During matu-
rity, sulfur deﬁciency in oilseed rape crops is revealed by a sparse, upright-standing crop.

Similarly, in cereals, sulfur deﬁciency develops ﬁrst on light-textured parts of the ﬁeld, yield-
ing irregularly shaped ‘wash-out’ areas in images from above. Nitrogen fertilization promotes the
expression of these irregularly distributed deﬁciency symptoms, such as uneven height and color.
The irregular shape distinguishes these symptoms from areas caused by faulty nitrogen fertilizer
application. In the ﬁeld, these particular zones can be identiﬁed by a green yellowish glow in the
backlight before sunset. Later, vegetation in these areas resembles a crop that is aﬀected by drought.
Owing to an inferior natural resistance (see also Section 7.5.2), the heads in sulfur-deﬁcient areas
can be infected more severely by fungal disease (e.g., Septoria species), which gives these areas a
darker color as the crop matures.

7.4 SOIL ANALYSIS
A close relationship between the plant-available sulfur content of the soil and yield is a prerequisite
for a reliable soil method. Such a signiﬁcant correlation was veriﬁed in pot trials under controlled
growth conditions (103,175–178). Several investigations have shown, however, that the relationship
between inorganic soil sulfate and crop yield is only weak, or even nonexistent, under ﬁeld condi-
tions (103,179–181). Such missing or poor correlations are the major reason for the large number of
diﬀerent methods of soil testing, and they justify ongoing research for new methods (114,182–185).
Soil analytical methods for plant-available sulfate diﬀer in the preparation of the soil samples, con-
centration and type of extractant, duration of the extraction procedure, the soil-to-extractant ratio, the

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 203

conditions of extraction, and the method that is used for the determination of sulfur or sulfate-S in
the extract. A serious problem with regard to all laboratory methods is the treatment and preserva-
tion of soil samples prior to analysis. Increased temperature and aeration of the sample during stor-
age  increase  the  amount  of  extractable  sulfur  by  oxidizing  labile  organic  sulfur  fractions, and
occasionally mobilize reduced inorganic sulfur (186–188).

Besides water, potassium or calcium dihydrogenphosphate solutions are the most commonly
used  solvents  to  extract  plant-available  sulfate  from  soils  (189,190).  Soils  with  a  high  sulfate
adsorption  capacity  are  low  in  pH, so  that  phosphate-containing  extractants  extract  more  sulfate
than other salt solutions because of ion-exchange processes. Sodium chloride is also used in coun-
tries where soils are frequently analyzed for available nitrate (183,191,192). Less frequently, mag-
nesium chloride (193) or acetate solutions are employed (194,195). Other methodical approaches
involve, for instance, anion-exchange resins (196,197) and perfusion systems (198).

In  aerated  agricultural  soils, the  organic  matter  is  the  soil-inherent  storage  and  backup  for
buﬀering sulfate in the soil solution (199–201), and methods are described which focus on captur-
ing organic sulfur fractions that might be mineralized during the vegetation period and thus con-
tribute  to  the  sulfate  pool  in  soils  (183,202–204).  Such  special  treatments  are, for  example, the
heating  of  the  samples  or  employing  alkaline  conditions  or  incubation  studies, which  allow  the
measurement of either the easily mineralized organic sulfur pool or the rapidly mineralized organic
sulfur. Most methods, however, extract easily soluble, plant-available sulfate.

The practical detection limit of sulfur determined by ICP-AES was 0.5 mg S L⫺1, correspon-
ding to 3.3 mg S kg⫺1 (205) in the soil. On sulfur-deﬁcient sites, however, sulfate-S concentrations
of only 2 mg S kg⫺1 were measured regularly in the topsoil by ion chromatography (206). Ion chro-
matography is much more sensitive, with a practical detection limit of 0.1 mg SO4-S L⫺1 (corre-
sponding to 0.67 mg S kg⫺1), allowing sulfate-S to be determined at low concentrations in soils.
Additionally, this fact explains why soil sulfate-S measured by ICP-AES is usually below the detec-
tion limit. No matter which method is applied, and on which soils or crops the method is used, there
is  an  astonishing  agreement  in  the  literature  for  approximately  10 mg  SO4-S  kg⫺1 as  the  critical
value for available sulfur in soils (68,192,207). With the most common methods for the determina-
tion of sulfur (ICP and the formation of BaSO4), values of ⬍ 10 mg S kg⫺1 will identify a sulfur-
deﬁcient soil with a high probability.

As expected, comparisons of diﬀerent extractants and methods revealed that under the same
conditions, all  of  these  methods  extract  more  or  less  the  same  amount  of  sulfate  from  the  soil
(178,182,183,185,198,203,207–209).  Occasionally  observed  diﬀerences  among  methods  were
more likely to be caused by interferences due to the extractant itself (183) rather than by the method
of sulfate-S determination (186,187).

As there is virtually no physicochemical interaction between the soil matrix and sulfate, the
amount that is present and extractable from the soil is the main indicator commonly used to describe
the sulfur nutritional status of a soil. Opinions in the literature on whether or not soil testing is a
suitable tool for determining the sulfur status of soils vary from high acceptance (210–215) down
to full denial (179,216–220).

Conclusions leading to high acceptance were always drawn from pot trials, which usually yield
high correlation coeﬃcients between soil analytical data, and give sulfur content or sulfur uptake of
plants  as  the  target  value  (103,178,183,185,192,194,198,212,221–223,225).  Pot  trials  are  always
prone to deliver very high correlations between soil, and plant data or yield, as there is no uncon-
trolled nutrient inﬂux and eﬄux. However, in the case of ﬁeld surveys involving a greater range of
sites and environmental factors, correlations are poor or fail to reach signiﬁcance (103,180). For the
relationship  between  available  sulfur  in  soils  and  foliar  sulfur, larger  surveys  employing  a  wide
range of available sulfur in soils (5 to 250 mg S kg⫺1), and plants (0.8 to 2.1 g S kg⫺1), reported cor-
relation coeﬃcients for a total of 1701 wheat and 1870 corn samples of r ⫽ 0.292 (P ⱕ 0.001) and
r ⫽ 0.398 (P ⱕ 0.001), respectively (195). Timmermann and coworkers (225) determined a correla-
tion coeﬃcient of r ⫽ 0.396 (P ⬍ 0.05) for 93 oilseed rape samples. In the ﬁeld surveys conducted

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 204

204

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

by  Schnug  (103), a  signiﬁcant  relationship  could  not  be  veriﬁed  for  489  oilseed  rape  samples
(r ⫽ 0.102, P ⬎ 0.05) or for 398 cereal samples (r ⫽ 0.098, P ⬎ 0.05).

These results imply that a maximum of 16% of the variability of the sulfur concentrations in
leaves can be explained by the variability of available sulfur in soils. However, Timmermann et al.
(225) were able to improve the relationship between soil and plant data by using the ratio of avail-
able sulfur and nitrogen in soils (Nmin/Smin) instead of just sulfur. This application gave a value of
r ⫽ ⫺0.605 (P ⱕ 0.01), which still explains less than one third of the variability.

The key problem of soil analysis for plant-available sulfur is that it is a static procedure that
aims at reﬂecting the dynamic transfer of nutrient species among diﬀerent chemical and biological
pools in the soil. This concept is appropriate if the sample covers the total soil volume to which
active plant roots have access and if no signiﬁcant vertical and lateral nutrient ﬂuxes occur to and
from this speciﬁc volume. Sulfate, however, has an enormously high mobility in soils and can be
delivered from sources such as subsoil or shallow groundwater, and sulfur has virtually no buﬀer
fraction in the soil. Thus, the availability of sulfate is a question of the transfer among pools in terms
of space and time rather than among biological or chemical reserves. Under ﬁeld conditions sulfate
moves easily in or out of the root zones so that close correlations with the plant sulfur status can
hardly be expected. Attempts have been made to take subsoil sulfate into account by increasing the
sampling depth (103,226–230), but the rapid vertical and lateral mobility of sulfate inﬂuences sub-
soils too. Thus, this procedure did not yield an improvement of the expressiveness of soil analyti-
cal data (103,225).

The soil sulfur cycle is driven by biological and physicochemical processes which aﬀect ﬂora
and fauna. The variability of sulfate-S contents in the soil over short distances is caused by the high
mobility  of  sulfate-S.  Sulfate  is  an  easily  soluble  anion, and  it  follows  soil  water  movements.
Signiﬁcant amounts of adsorbed sulfate are found only in clay and sesquioxide-rich soil horizons
with  pH  values ⬍ 5, which  is  far  below  the  usual  pH  of  northern  European  agricultural  soils.
Seasonal variations in mineralization, leaching, capillary rise, and plant uptake cause temporal vari-
ations in the sulfate-S content of the soil (205). The high spatiotemporal variation of sulfate in soils
is the reason for the inadequacy of soil analysis in predicting the nutritional status of sulfur in soils.
Thus, under humid conditions, the sulfur status of an agricultural site is diﬃcult to assess (231). An
overview of the factors of time and soil depth in relation to the variability of sulfate-S contents is
given in Figure 7.13. The highest variability of sulfate-S could be observed on two sites in soil sam-
ples collected in April (Figure 7.13). On a sandy soil, the variability was distinctly higher at the sec-
ond and third dates of sampling in comparison with a loamy soil, but time-dependent changes were
signiﬁcant  only  in  the  deeper  soil  layers. Though  the  range  of  sulfate-S  contents  measured  was
smaller on the loamy soil than on the sandy soil, the diﬀerences proved to be signiﬁcant in all soil
layers between the ﬁrst and third and second and third dates of sampling respectively (Figure 7.13).
Sources and sinks commonly included in a sulfur balance are inputs by depositions from atmos-
phere, fertilizers, plant residues, and mineralization, and outputs by losses due to leaching. A fre-
quent problem when establishing such simple sulfur balances is that the budget does not correspond
to the actual sulfur supply. The reason is that under temperate conditions it is the spatiotemporal
variation of hydrological soil properties that controls the plant-available sulfate-S content. A more
promising  way  to  give  a  prognosis  of  the  sulfur  supply  is  a  site-speciﬁc  sulfur  budget, which
includes information about geomorphology, texture, climatic data, and crop type and characteristics
of the local soil water regime (Figure 7.14).

The results presented in Figure 7.14 reveal that plant sulfur status is distinctly higher on sites
with access to groundwater than on sandy soils not inﬂuenced by groundwater. The signiﬁcance of
plant-available soil water as a source and storage for sulfur has been disregarded or underestimated
so far. However, especially under humid growth conditions, plant-available soil water is the largest
contributor to the sulfur balance (205). Leaching and import from subsoil or shallow groundwater
sources  (184,205)  can  change  the  amount  of  plant-available  sulfate  within  a  very  short  time.
Groundwater is a large pool for sulfur, because sulfur concentrations of 5 to 100 mg S L⫺1 are common

in surfaces near groundwater (205,232). There are three ways in which groundwater contributes to
the sulfur nutrition of plants. First, there is a direct sulfur input if the groundwater level is only 1 to
2 m below the surface, which is suﬃcient to cover the sulfur requirement of most crops as plants
can utilize the sulfate in the groundwater directly by their root systems. Second, groundwater, which
is used for irrigation, can supply up to 100 kg S ha⫺1 to the crop (205,233–235), but irrigation water
will contribute signiﬁcantly to the sulfur supply only if applied at the start of the main growth period

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 206

of the crop. Third, the capillary rise of groundwater under conditions of a water-saturation deﬁcit
in the upper soil layers leads to a sulfur input. This process is closely related to climatic conditions.
The sulfur supply of a crop increases with the amount of plant-available water or shallow ground-
water. The higher the water storage capacity of a soil, the less likely are losses of water and sulfate-
S by leaching and the greater is the pool of porous water and also the more likely is an enrichment
of sulfate just by subsequent evaporation. Thus, heavy soils have a higher charging capacity for sul-
fate-S than light ones.

7.5 PLANT ANALYSIS
Plant families and species show great variabilities in sulfur concentrations. In general, gramineous
species have lower sulfur levels than dicotyledonous crops (see Section 7.3.2). Within each genus,
however, species producing S-containing secondary metabolites accumulate more sulfur than those
without this capacity. The ratios of sulfur concentrations in photosynthetically active tissue of cere-
als, sugar beet, onion, and oilseed rape are approximately 1:1.5:2:3 (114,236). Thus plants with a
higher tendency to accumulate sulfur, such as brassica species, are very suitable as monitor crops
to evaluate diﬀerences between sites and environments, or for quick growing tests (176). Generative
material is less suited for diagnostic purposes (237), because the sulfur concentration in seeds is
determined  much  more  by  genetic  factors  (43,103,116).  During  plant  growth, morphological
changes occur and there is translocation of nutrients within the plant. Thus, changes in the nutrient
concentration are not only related to ﬂuctuations in its supply, but also to the plant part and plant
age. These factors need to be taken into account when interpreting and comparing results of plant
analysis (216,238–243). Basically, noting the time of sampling and analyzed plant part is simply a
convention, but there are some practical reasons for it that should be considered: (a) photosynthet-
ically active leaves show the highest sulfur concentrations of all plant organs, and as sulfur has a
restricted mobility in plants sulfur concentrations in young tissues will respond ﬁrst to changes in
the sulfur supply; (b) sampling early in the vegetative state of a crop allows more time to correct
sulfur deﬁciency by fertilization. It is relevant in this context that plant analysis is a reliable tool to
evaluate the sulfur nutritional status, but usually it is not applicable as a diagnostic tool on produc-
tion ﬁelds because of the shortcomings mentioned above.

In dicotyledonous crops, young, fully expanded leaves are the strongest sinks for sulfur, and
they  are  available  during  vegetative  growth.  Therefore, they  are  preferable  for  tissue  analysis
(88,103,244). Oilseed rape, for instance, delivers suitable leaves for tissue analysis until 1 week
after ﬂowering, and sugar beet gives suitable leaves until the canopy covers the ground and the stor-
age roots start to extend (103).

For  the  analysis  of  gramineous  crops, either  whole  plants  (1 cm  above  the  ground)  after  the
appearance of the ﬁrst and before the appearance of the second node, or ﬂag leaves are best suited
for providing samples for analysis (142,143,245–249).

In all cases, care has to be taken to avoid contamination of tissue samples with sulfur from foliar
fertilizers  or  sulfur-containing  pesticides.  Care  is  also  needed  when  cleaning  samples, because
water used for washing may contain signiﬁcant amounts of sulfate. Paper used for sample drying
and storage contains distinct amounts of sulfate, originating from the manufacturing process. As
sulfate bound in paper is more or less insoluble, the risk of contamination when washing plants is
low, but adherent paper particles may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the results obtained.

7.5.1 ANALYTICAL METHODS
Sulfur occurs in plants in diﬀerent chemical forms (250), and nearly all of them have been tested as
indicators for sulfur nutritional status. The parameters analyzed by laboratory methods for the pur-
pose of diagnostics can be divided into three general classes: biological, chemical, and composed
parameters.

207

Biological parameters are the sulfate and glutathione content. Many authors proposed the sul-
fate-S  content  as  the  most  suitable  diagnostic  criterion  for  the  sulfur  supply  of  plants
(241,242,251–255). They justify their opinion by referring to the role of sulfate as the major trans-
port and storage form of sulfur in plants (256,257). Other authors, however, attribute this function
also  to  glutathione  (55,258,259).  Based  on  this  concept, Zhao  et  al.  (260)  investigated  the  glu-
tathione content as a diagnostic parameter for sulfur deﬁciency.

Although indeed directly depending on the sulfur supply of the plant (64,103), neither of the
compounds is a very reliable indicator for the sulfur status because their concentrations are governed
by many other parameters, such as the actual physiological activity, the supply of other mineral nutri-
ents, and  the  inﬂuence  of  biotic  and  abiotic  factors  (5,63,256,261).  Biotic  stress, for  instance,
increased the glutathione content by 24% (63). Amino acid synthesis is inﬂuenced by the deﬁciency
of any nutrient and thus may indirectly cause an increase in sulfate or glutathione in the tissue. An
example  for  this  action  is  the  increase  in  sulfate  following  nitrogen  deﬁciency  (103,262,263).
Signiﬁcant amounts of sulfate may also be physically immobilized in vacuoles (see Section 7.2.1).
In plant species synthesizing glucosinolates, sulfate concentrations can also be increased by the
release of sulfate during the enzymatic cleavage of these compounds after sampling (103). As enzy-
matically released sulfate can amount to the total physiological level required, this type of post-
sampling  interference  can  be  a  signiﬁcant  source  of  error, yielding  up  to  10%  higher  sulfate
concentrations (63,103). It is probably also the reason for some extraordinarily high critical values
for sulfate concentrations reported for brassica species (220,264). The preference for sulfate analy-
sis as a diagnostic criterion may also come from its easier analytical determination compared to any
other sulfur compound or to the total sulfur concentration (265).

Hydrogen iodide (HI)-reducible S, acid-soluble sulfur, and total sulfur are chemical parameters
used to describe the sulfur status of plants. None of them is related to a single physiological sulfur-
containing compound. The HI-reducible sulfur or acid-soluble sulfur estimate approximately the
same amount of the total sulfur in plant tissue (∼50%). The acid-soluble sulfur is the sulfur extracted
from plant tissue by a mixture of acetic, phosphoric, and hydrochloric acids according to Sinclair
(167), who described this extractant originally for the determination of sulfate. Schnug (103) found
in  tissue  samples  from  more  than  500  ﬁeld-grown  oilseed  rape  and  cereal  plants  that  the  acid-
soluble sulfur content (y) is very closely correlated with the total sulfur content (x). The slope of the
correlations  is  identical, but  the  intercept  is  speciﬁc  for  species  with  or  without  S-containing
secondary metabolites:

oilseed rape: y ⫽ 0.58x ⫺ 1.25; r ⫽ 0.946

cereals: y ⫽ 0.58x ⫺ 0.39; r ⫽ 0.915

As  the  total  sulfur  content  in  Sinclair’s  (167)  solution  is  easy  to  analyze  by  ICP, this  extraction
method seems to be a promising substitute for wet digestion with concentrated acids or using x-ray
ﬂuorescence spectroscopy for total sulfur determination (53,103,266–268).

The total sulfur content is most frequently used for the evaluation of the sulfur nutritional status
(see Section 7.5.3). Precision and accuracy of the analytical method employed for the determination
of the total sulfur content are crucial. In proﬁciency tests, X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy proved to
be fast and precise (269,270). Critical values for total sulfur diﬀer in relation to the growth stage
(242,261), but this problem is also true for all the other parameters and can be overcome only by a
strict dedication of critical values to deﬁned plant organs and development stages (103). If this pro-
cedure is followed strictly, the total sulfur content of plants has the advantage of being less inﬂuenced
by short-term physiological changes that easily aﬀect fractions such as sulfate or glutathione.

Composed  parameters  are  the  nitrogen/sulfur  (N:S)  ratio, the  percentage  of  sulfate-S  from  the
total sulfur concentration, and the sulfate/malate ratio. The concept of the N/S ratio is based on the
fact that plants require sulfur and nitrogen in proportional quantities for the biosynthesis of amino
acids (271–273). Therefore, deviations from the typical N/S ratio were proposed as an indicator for
sulfur deﬁciency (239,274–281). Calculated on the basis of the composition of amino acids in oilseed
rape  leaf  protein, the  optimum  N/S  ratio  for  this  crop  should  theoretically  be  12:1  (103,282), but

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 208

208

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

empirically maximum yields were achieved at N/S ratios of 6:1 to 8:1 (216,242,253,283). Distinct
relationships between N/S ratio and yield occur only in the range of extreme N/S ratios. Such N/S
ratios may be produced in pot trials but do not occur under ﬁeld conditions (see Figure 7.16).

There is no doubt that balanced nutrient ratios in plant tissues are essential for crop productiv-
ity, quality, and plant health, but the strongest argument against using the N/S ratio to assess the
nutritional status is that it can result from totally diﬀerent N and sulfur concentrations in the plant
tissue. Surplus of one element may therefore falsely be interpreted as a deﬁciency of the other (284).
The suitability of N/S ratios as a diagnostic criterion also implies a constancy (273,285–288), which
is at least not true for species with a signiﬁcant secondary metabolism of S-containing compounds
such as Brassica and Allium species (289,290). Additionally, it requires the determination of two
elements and thus is more laborious and costly.

The percentage of sulfate-S of the total sulfur content has been proposed as a diagnostic criterion
(240–242,251–255). Except for laboratories operating x-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, which allows
the simultaneous determination of sulfate-S and total sulfur (291,292), this determination doubles the
analytical eﬀorts without particular beneﬁt. The sulfate/malate ratio is another example of a composed
parameter (293). Though both parameters can be analyzed by ion chromatography in one run, the basic
objection made with regard to sulfate (see above), namely its high variability, also applies to malate.

7.5.2 ASSESSMENT OF CRITICAL NUTRIENT VALUES
Critical values are indispensable for evaluating the nutritional status of a crop. Important threshold
markers are: (a) the symptomatological value, which reﬂects the sulfur concentration below which
deﬁciency symptoms become visible (see Section 7.3.1); (b) the critical nutrient value, which stands
for the sulfur concentration above which the plant is suﬃciently supplied with sulfur for achieving
the maximum potential yield or yield reduced by 5, 10, or 20% (294); and (c) the toxicological value,
which indicates the sulfur concentration above which toxicity symptoms can be observed. However,
there is no one exclusive critical nutrient value for any crop, as it depends on the growth conditions,
the  developmental  stage  of  the  plant  at  sampling, the  collected  plant  part, the  determined  sulfur
species, the targeted yield, and the mathematical approach for calculating it. Smith and Loneragan
(295) provided a comprehensive, general overview of the signiﬁcance of relevant factors inﬂuencing
the derivation of critical values. Numerous, diﬀering critical sulfur values and ranges exist for each
crop and have been compiled, for instance by Reuter and Robinson (294), for all essential plant nutri-
ents and cultivated plants including forest plantations. In this section, an attempt was made to com-
pile  and  categorize, from  the  literature, available  individual  data  based  on  studies  with  varying
experimental conditions of the variables, total sulfur and sulfate concentrations, and N/S ratios in
relation to diﬀerent groups of crops for facilitating an easy and appropriate evaluation of sulfur sup-
ply. Plant groups were assembled by morphogenetic and physiological features. Because of the wide
heterogeneity of results for similar classes of sulfur supply and for a better comparability of results,
concentrations were agglomerated into three major categories: deﬁcient, adequate, and high, irre-
spective of the sampled plant part during vegetative growth (Table 7.6). A prior-made subdivision,
which took these relevant criteria into consideration (see Section 7.3.1) next to additional character-
istics of the sulfur supply (symptomatological and critical values of total S, sulfate, and N/S ratio),
did not prove to be feasible as the variation of results was so high that no clear ranges, let alone
threshold  values, could  be  assigned  for  individual  classes  and  crops, or  crop  groups.  Smith  and
Loneragan (295) stressed that in addition to various biotic and abiotic factors, experimental condi-
tions, plant age, and plant part, all inﬂuence the nutrient status; the procedure to derive a critical value
itself has a signiﬁcant impact, so that it is possible to deﬁne only ranges for diﬀerent nutritional lev-
els. This  ﬁnding  also  implies  that  it  is  more  or  less  impossible  to  compare  results  from  diﬀerent
experiments. The integration of individual studies, which imply extreme values, are not suitable for
a generalization of an aﬃliation to a certain class of sulfur supply and, more importantly, such inter-
pretation may even yield an erroneous evaluation of the sulfur supply. In comparison, the compilation

of the data in Table 7.6 indicates that the sampled plant part during the main vegetative development
seems to be of minor relevance for generally addressing the sulfur nutritional status. However, for
following  up, for  instance, nutritional  or  pathogen-related  changes  in  sulfur  metabolism, it  might
even be necessary to do so in deﬁned parts of a plant organ or on a leaf cell level.

The results in Table 7.6 reveal that Poaceae and fodder crops have been studied intensely in rela-
tion to sulfur nutritional supply. For all crops, the total sulfur concentration was used most often to
characterize the sulfur nutritional status. The range of variation was distinctly lower for total sulfur

than for sulfate concentrations, independent of the crop type. It is also remarkable that the ranges in
the three classes overlap regularly for all groups of crops and sulfur fractions. With the exception of
the fodder crops, however, the 25 and 75% quartiles separate samples from the three nutritional lev-
els eﬃciently if total sulfur concentrations were determined. For sulfate, such partition was feasible
too, except in Poaceae. Generally, an insuﬃcient sulfur supply is indicated by total sulfur concentra-
tions of ⬍1.7 mg g⫺1. In the case of Poaceae and nonbrassica vegetables, this value may be lower at
0.94 mg S g⫺1 or higher at 2.9 mg S g⫺1 (Table 7.6; Section 7.3.1). Sulfate concentrations of ⬍150 mg
SO4-S kg⫺1 indicate an insuﬃcient sulfur supply. An adequate sulfur supply is reﬂected by total sul-
fur concentrations of 1.7 to 4 mg S g⫺1; brassica crops show a higher optimum range with values of
4.8 (oil crops) to 7.5 (vegetables) mg S g⫺1 (Table 7.6). Values of 16 to 20 for N/S ratio, and 150 to
1600 for sulfate-S concentrations reﬂect a suﬃcient sulfur supply. In comparison, values of ⬎2800 mg
SO4-S kg⫺1 denote an excessive sulfur supply (Table 7.6). Sulfate is usually not determined in bras-
sica oil crops and vegetables as the degradation of glucosinolates might falsify the result (see Section
7.5).  For  fodder  crops, total  sulfur  concentrations  of  even  3.2 mg  S  g⫺1 may  be  disproportionate,
whereas the corresponding value for nonbrassica vegetables would equal 10 mg S g⫺1.

The major criticism of critical values for the interpretation of tissue analysis is the small experi-
mental basis, which often consists of not more than a single experiment (297). Besides the lack of data,
the method of interpretation may also yield erroneous results. Methods based on regression analysis,
like the ‘broken stick method’ by Hudson (298) and Spencer and Freney (241), or the ‘vector analy-
sis’ by Timmer and Armstrong (299) investigate mathematical, but not necessarily causal, interactions
between the nutrient content and yield, because the dictate of minimizing the sum of squared distances
aims only to ﬁnd a function that ﬁts best across the data set. Like the method of Cate and Nelson
(300,301), these methods have been designed primarily for the investigation of small data sets and
plants grown under ceteris paribus conditions, where only the response to variations in the nutrient
supply  varied.  Another  quite  signiﬁcant  disadvantage  of  critical  values  and  critical  ranges*
(143,296,302), or  ‘no-eﬀect  values  (NEV)’† (284)  is  that  they  ignore  the  nonlinearity  of  the
Mitscherlich function describing the relationship between growth factors and yield (303). The ideal
basis for critical values for the interpretation of tissue analysis are large sets of yield data and nutrient
concentrations in deﬁned plant organs that cover a wide range of growth factor combinations. The data
may include samples from ﬁeld surveys or ﬁeld or pot experiments if the reference yield of 100% was
obtained in all cases under optimum growth conditions. In Figure 7.15 and Figure 7.16, corresponding
examples are given for the total sulfur concentration in shoots of cereals at stem extension and the N/S
ratio in younger, fully developed leaves of oilseed rape at stem extension.

The data in Figure 7.15 reveal a characteristic bow-shaped bulk, which covers sulfur concentrations
from 0.5 to 5.5 mg S g⫺1. Sulfur deﬁciency can be expected at sulfur concentrations below 0.94 mg g⫺1
(Table 7.6). A symptomatological threshold for the expression of macroscopic symptoms of 1.2 mg S g⫺1
was determined for cereals by Schnug and Haneklaus (114). Total sulfur concentrations of 1.7 mg g⫺1
are considered as being adequate to satisfy the sulfur demand of cereal crops, whereas the data in Figure
7.15 show a further yield increase with higher sulfur concentrations. The reason is simply that the 100%
yield margin corresponds to a grain yield of 10 t ha⫺1 (180), so that accordingly a total sulfur concen-
tration of 1.7 mg S g⫺1 would be suﬃcient for 8.2 t ha⫺1. A productivity level of 10 t ha⫺1 is extraordi-
narily high and restricted to areas of high fertility or inputs, whereas a level of 8 t ha⫺1 represents a
high-yielding crop in many areas in the world. Thus, a total sulfur concentration of 4.7 mg g⫺1, which
is rated as reﬂecting a high sulfur supply, is marginal on high productivity sites.

Basic shortcomings of using, for instance, the N/S ratio for the evaluation of the sulfur nutri-
tional status were discussed (Section 7.5) and are reﬂected in the data in Figure 7.16. Hence, there
are no relationships between N/S ratio and yield in a way as was shown for total sulfur and cereals
(Figure 7.15). Crop productivity seems to be fairly independent of variations in the N/S ratio within
a range of 5:1 to 12:1 (Figure 7.16).

*Tissue concentration for 95% of maximum yield.
†Tissue concentration for maximum yield or the concentration above which no yield response occurs.

Comprehensive data sets like those presented in Figure 7.15 allow for the accurate calculations
of  so-called  upper  boundary  line  functions, which  describe  the  highest  yields  observed  over  the
range of nutrient values measured. Data points below this line relate to samples where some other
factor limited the crop response to the nutrient. An overview of the scientiﬁc background and devel-
opment of upper boundary lines is given by Schnug et al. (304).

The Boundary Line Development System (BOLIDES) was elaborated to determine the upper
boundary  line  functions  and  to  evaluate  optimum  nutrient  values  and  ranges.  The  BOLIDES  is
based on a ﬁve-step algorithm (Figure 7.17) (304). For the identiﬁcation of outliers, cell sizes are
deﬁned for nutrient and yield values together with an optional number of data points per cell (Figure
7.17a). The cell size can be chosen variably with proposed values for X (nutrient content) corre-
sponding to the standard deviations and for Y (yield) with the coeﬃcient of variation. If another
variable, often a stable soil feature such as organic matter or clay content, has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the  response  to  the  nutrient, its  presence  is  indicated  by  two  or  more  distinct  concentrations  of
points, each with its own boundary line response to the nutrient (Figure 7.17b). The data can be
classiﬁed on the basis of this third variable, and the boundary line can be determined separately for
each class. Next, a boundary step function is calculated for each class, starting from the minimum
nutrient content up to the point of maximum yield, as well as from the maximum nutrient content
up to the maximum yield (Figure 7.17c). Then the boundary line, usually a ﬁrst-order polynomial
function, is ﬁtted according to the least-squares method (Figure 7.17d). The ﬁrst derivative of the
ﬁtted polynomial gives predicted yield response to fertilization in relation to the nutrient content
(Figure 7.17). The last step is the classiﬁcation of the nutrient supply to determine optimum nutri-
ent levels or optimum nutrient ranges. The optimum nutrient value corresponds with the zero of the
ﬁrst derivative of the upper boundary line and the sign of the second derivative at this point. For the
determination of the optimum ranges, that is, the range of nutrient concentration that gives 95% of
the maximum yield, standard, numerical root-ﬁnding procedures are used for real polynomials of
degree 4 with constant coeﬃcients (Figure 7.17).

Thus boundary lines describe the ‘pure eﬀect of a nutrient’ on crop yield under ceteris paribus
conditions  (246,247,305,306).  The  comparison  of  the  boundary  lines  for  total  sulfur  and  yield

FIGURE 7.18 Comparison of boundary line functions for yield and total sulfur concentration in tissue of
cereals, oilseed rape, and sugar beet. (From Schnug, E. and Haneklaus, S., in Sulphur in Agroecosystems, Vol.
2, Part of the series ‘Nutrients in Ecosystems’, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 1–38.)

(both  relative)  for  oilseed  rape, cereals, and  sugar  beet  (Figure  7.18)  reveals  the  physiological
diﬀerences between these crops. The boundary lines for cereals and oilseed rape are for seed yields,
and that for sugar beet for root yields. The optimum sulfur ranges proved to be the same for sugar
beet root yield and sugar yield.

For  all  crops, the  boundary  lines  show  a  steep  increase  at  the  beginning, which  reﬂects  the
response of the photosynthetic system to sulfur deﬁciency. In cereals, the boundary line continues
over a long range and asymptotically toward the value above which no further yield increase (NEV)
is to be expected from increasing sulfur concentrations. This part of the boundary line most likely
reﬂects the proportion of sulfur that is bound to the proteins of the cereal grain. In sugar beet, the
boundary line reaches the NEV much faster after a steep increase, which is in line with the fact that
sugar beet roots take up only small amounts of sulfur (205). Oilseed rape, with its internal storage
system for S, which is based on the enzymatic recycling of glucosinolates (90,289), shows a stead-
ier ascent of its boundary line. Therefore, within oilseed rape varieties, those with genetically low
glucosinolate contents (‘double low’ or ‘00’ varieties) show a steeper increase of their boundary
lines than those with genetically high glucosinolate concentrations (103,116).

The nonlinearity of the boundary lines reveals once more the limited value of critical values.
Above total sulfur concentrations of 6.5, 4.0, and 3.5 mg g⫺1 in foliar tissue of oilseed rape, cere-
als, and sugar beet, respectively, no further yield increases are to be expected by increasing tissue
sulfur  concentrations  (NEVs).  This  result  corresponds  to  the  usually  assigned  ‘critical  values,’
which are valid for 95% of the maximum yield, of 5.5, 3.2, and 3.0 mg S g⫺1 for rape, corn, and
sugar beets, respectively. However, in this range of the response curve, there is still no linearity
between tissue sulfur levels and yield.

The relationship between sulfur concentration in plant tissue and yield, which reﬂects the phys-
iological patterns in the internal nutrient utilization, is speciﬁc for each plant species, and can be best
established by boundary lines (Figure 7.17). In comparison, the relationship between fertilizer dose
and  sulfur  concentration  in  plant  tissues  is  much  less  dependent  on  physiological  factors  but  is
strongly  inﬂuenced  by  factors  aﬀecting  the  physical  mobility  and  losses  of  sulfur  from  soils.
Therefore, this transfer function bears the largest part of insecurity for the eﬀectiveness of sulfur fer-
tilization. Thus, for the derivation of fertilizer recommendations, the common relationship between
fertilizer dose and yield is best split into two partial relationships: (a) fertilizer dose versus nutrient

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 217

Sulfur

217

uptake and (b) nutrient uptake versus yield (307). If tissue analysis is to be used for fertilizer rec-
ommendations, concentrations need to be calibrated against sulfur doses. This strategy was proved
for nitrogen (308), and the setting up of sulfur response curves is recommended for sulfur too.

Professional Interpretation Program for Plant Analysis (PIPPA) software not only evaluates the
status of individual plant nutrients but also appraises results from multiple elemental analyses (309).
In PIPPA, boundary line and transfer functions are integrated for each element so that the yield-
limiting eﬀect is calculated for each speciﬁed nutrient, and ﬁnally fertilizer recommendations are
given (309).

7.5.3 SULFUR STATUS AND PLANT HEALTH
Although  the  signiﬁcance  of  individual  nutrients  for  maintaining  or  promoting  plant  health  saw
some  interest  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  (143), research  in  the  ﬁeld  of  nutrient-induced  resistance
mechanisms  has  been  scarce  because  of  its  complexity, and  because  of  its  limited  practical
signiﬁcance due to the availability of eﬀective pesticides.

Since the beginning of the 1980s, atmospheric sulfur depositions have been declining drasti-
cally after Clean Air Acts came into force, and severe sulfur deﬁciency advanced to a major nutri-
tional  disorder  in Western  Europe  (114,310,311).  Increased  infections  of  agricultural  crops  with
fungal  pathogens  were  observed, and  diseases  spread  throughout  the  regions  that  were  never
infected before (312). Sulfur fertilization, applied to the soil as sulfate, proved to have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the infection rate and infection severity of diﬀerent crops by fungal diseases (148). Sulfur
fertilization increased the resistance against various fungal diseases in diﬀerent crops under green-
house  (313,314)  and  ﬁeld  conditions  (315–317).  Based  on  these  ﬁndings, the  concept  of  sulfur-
induced resistance (SIR) was developed; research in this ﬁeld has strengthened since then, and the
advances made are discussed comprehensively by Bloem et al. (318) and Haneklaus et al. (148).

The  term  SIR  stands  for  the  reinforcement  of  the  natural  resistance  of  plants  against  fungal
pathogens through triggering of the stimulation of metabolic processes involving sulfur by targeted
fertilizer application strategies (148). A suﬃcient sulfur supply and an adequate availability of plant-
available sulfate are presumably a prerequisite for inducing S-dependent resistance mechanisms in the
plant so that the required sulfur rates and sulfur status may be higher than the physiological demand.
The mechanisms possibly involved in SIR may be related to processes of induced resistance
(319), for example, via the formation of phytoalexins and glutathione, or the requirement of cys-
teine for the synthesis of salicylic acid by β-oxidation and the cysteine pool itself. Another option
is the release of reduced sulfur gases, such as H2S, which is described in the literature as being fun-
gitoxic. The H2S may be produced prior to or after cysteine formation (see Section 7.2 and (320)).
Two enzymes that could be responsible for the H2S release are L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) and
O-acetyl-L-serine(thiol)lyase (OAS-TL). The LCD catalyzes the decomposition of cysteine to pyru-
vate, ammonia, and H2S. The OAS-TL is responsible for the incorporation of inorganic sulfur into
the amino acid cysteine, which can be subsequently converted into other sulfur-containing com-
pounds such as methionine or glutathione. The H2S is evolved in a side reaction because of the
nature of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor and the speciﬁc reaction mechanism of the OAS-TL
protein (321). There is wide variation with regard to speciﬁcations about the release of H2S, rang-
ing from 0.04 ng g⫺1 s⫺1 in whole soybean plants on a dry matter basis (322) to 100 pmol min⫺1 cm⫺1
in leaf discs of cucumber (323). Thus, H2S emissions of cut plant parts may be 500 times higher
than in intact plants (Table 7.7).

The release of H2S by plants is supposedly regulated by interactions in the N and sulfur meta-
bolic pathways. Lakkineni et al. (327) demonstrated a distinct increase in H2S emissions when leaf
discs of mustard, wheat, and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were fed with sulfate or cysteine
(Table 7.8). Supply of additional nitrogen with the sulfate did not cause H2S emissions to increase
(Table 7.8). Lakkineni et al. (330) suggested a preferable synthesis of nitrogen- or sulfur-containing
products at the level of substrate availability.

H2S and DMS emissions by plants are, however, supposedly not involved in SIR against fungal
pathogens belonging to the class Basidiomycetes, as fumigation experiments with fungal mycelium
of Rhizoctonia solani revealed that the pathogen metabolized both gases eﬃciently (331).

The amino acids cysteine and methionine are the major end products of sulfate assimilation in
plants and bind up to 90% of the total sulfur (320). Conditions of sulfur deﬁciency will result in a
decrease of sulfur-containing amino acids in proteins (5). As the amino acid composition is genet-
ically determined, this eﬀect is limited, and thereafter the total protein content will be reduced (5).
Amino  acid  type  and  concentration  in  plant  tissues  are  related  to  the  susceptibility  of  plants  to

CRC_DK2972_Ch007.qxd  6/30/2006  3:59 PM  Page 219

Sulfur

219

pathogens (332). Amino acids occur in the free state in plants, and the amino acids cysteine and
methionine are enriched in resistant plant tissues. Soil-applied sulfur signiﬁcantly increased the free
cysteine  content  in  the  vegetative  tissue  from  0.5  to  1.2 µmol  g⫺1 d.w.  (63).  Bosma  et  al.  (333)
reported  a  two-  to  ﬁve-fold  increase  in  the  content  of  water-soluble  nonprotein  sulfhydryl  com-
pounds  in  clover  (Trifolium spp.)  and  spinach  after  fumigation  with  H2S  under  ﬁeld  conditions,
whereby the cysteine content increased 10-fold. De Kok (18) reported similar results for fumigation
experiments with sulfur dioxide.

Glutathione is a major, free, low-molecular, nonprotein, thiol compound and is an important
reservoir for nonprotein reduced sulfur in plants (66). A relationship between glutathione content
and the extent of protection against fungal diseases exists (72). A low glutathione content in plants
does not inevitably imply, however, a higher susceptibility of the plant, as a rapid accumulation of
glutathione in response to pathogen attack was noted (334), and this observation proved to be deci-
sive  in  pathogenesis  (72).  Sulfur-deﬁcient  plants  have  very  low  glutathione  concentrations, and
sulfur  fertilization  signiﬁcantly  increases  the  free  thiol  content  (Table  7.3;  Section  7.2.3).
Basically, sulfur-deﬁcient plants are expected to be more vulnerable to stress factors, which are
usually compensated by the glutathione system so that sulfur fertilization should have a positive
eﬀect on resistance mechanisms.

Phytoalexins are important for plant defense (335). Phytoalexins are secondary plant metabo-
lites which are synthesized de novo and accumulate in response to diverse forms of stress, includ-
ing pathogenesis (336). The immunity is generally of short duration and is concentrated around the
infected area. According to this deﬁnition, the formation of elemental sulfur, the stress-induced for-
mation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and a novel class of LMW antibiotics, all come under
the term phytoalexins. At the moment however, the inﬂuence of the sulfur nutritional status on phy-
toalexin synthesis can only be speculated from the dependency of their precursors on the sulfur sup-
ply.  The  inﬂuence  of  the  sulfur  nutritional  status  on  the  synthesis  of  PR-12, PR-13, and  PR-14
proteins and elemental sulfur depositions in plant tissues remains obscure too (148).

7.6 SULFUR FERTILIZATION
The optimum timing, dose, and sulfur form used depends on the speciﬁc sulfur demand of a crop
and application technique. Under humid conditions, the sulfur dose should be split in such a way
that sulfur fertilization in autumn is applied to satisfy the sulfur demand on light, sandy soils before
winter and to promote the natural resistance against diseases. At the start of the main vegetative
growth, sulfur  should  be  applied  together  with  nitrogen.  With  farmyard  manure, on  an  average
0.07 kg sulfur is applied with each kg of nitrogen. In mineral fertilizers and secondary raw materi-
als, sulfur is available usually as sulfate, elemental sulfur, and sulﬁte. Sulfate is taken up directly by
plant roots, whereas sulﬁte and elemental sulfur need prior oxidation to sulfate, whereby the speed
of transformation depends on the particle size and dimension of the thiobacillus population in the
soil (Figure 7.19) (337,338).

The main secondary-sulfur-containing raw materials from the ﬂue gas desulfurization process
are gypsum and spray dry absorption (SDA) products, which are a mixture of calcium sulﬁte and
calcium sulfate in a mass ratio of about 8:1 (340). SDA products with ﬂy ash contents ⬍ 8% may
contain  up  to  68%  calcium  sulﬁte, whereas  this  percentage  in  products  with  ﬂy  ash  contents
between 20 and 85% will not exceed 47% (341). A phytotoxic eﬀect of sulﬁte applied by SDA prod-
ucts was observed when it was used as a culture substrate and on soils with a pH ⬍ 4 (337). The
time required for complete oxidation of sulﬁte is about 2 weeks (342). Sulﬁte oxidation proceeds
faster with increasing oxygen content and soil pH, and decreasing soil moisture content (343,344).
When sulfur was applied at rates of ⱕ80 kg ha⫺1 to exclusively satisfy the sulfur demand of agri-
cultural crops, no negative impact on crop performance and subsequent crops in the rotation was
detected (337,342,345,346).

In general, the eﬃciency of sulfur uptake by rape is highly dependent on the sulfur status of the
shoots (Figure 7.20). There is a close relationship between the initial sulfur content and its increase

by  fertilization.  Under  sulfur-limiting  growth  conditions, root-expressed  sulfur  transporters  are
highly regulated and induced (see Section 7.2.1 and Section 7.2.2). Besides that, sulfur fertilization
improved root growth and thus access to sulfate (53).

An insuﬃcient sulfur supply will not only reduce crop productivity, diminish crop quality, and
aﬀect  plant  health, but  it  also  will  impair  nitrogen-use  eﬃciency  (53,347).  Under  conditions  of

sulfur deﬁciency, nitrate and non-S-containing amino acids accumulate—actions which may reduce
the nitrate reductase activity (see Section 7.2.4; 348). Sulfur fertilization promotes nitrate reduction
and thus restricts nitrate accumulation in vegetative tissues. In Table 7.9, the inﬂuence of an increas-
ing sulfur supply on the nitrate reductase activity and nitrogen-use eﬃciency is shown.

The highest nitrate reductase activity occurred at a sulfur dose of 120 kg S ha⫺1 and the highest
N-use eﬃciency at 160 kg S ha⫺1 (Table 7.9) (349). This result corresponds to an increase of 18.2
and 18.7%, respectively, for the two doses. In comparison, the net nitrogen utilization of oilseed
rape and cereals was signiﬁcantly increased by sulfur fertilization by about 7 to 16%. A sulfur appli-
cation rate of 100 kg S ha⫺1 yielded the best results for oilseed rape during three consecutive years
of experimentation (347).

The  sulfur  demands  of  agricultural  crops  vary  highly, as  do  the  recommended  sulfur  doses
(Table 7.10). Recommended sulfur rates vary between 30 and 100 kg S ha⫺1 for oilseed rape, and
between 20 and 50 kg S ha⫺1 for cereals (103,337,348). For other crops such as sugar beet, grass-
land, rice, and soybean, the highest crop productivity occurred at sulfur rates of 25, 40, 45, and
60 kg S ha⫺1, respectively (351–353).

Aulakh (364) gives a detailed overview of sulfur uptake and crop responses to sulfur fertiliza-
tion in terms of yield and quality, with special attention being paid to crops grown in India. Sulfur
fertilizer can be applied to the soil or given as foliar dressings. As the sulfur dose is limited when
applied via the leaves, this form of fertilization can only be a complementary measure to correct
severe sulfur deﬁciency. Usually, for foliar applications, either Epsom salts or elemental S are used.
Calculated from changes in the sulfur uptake by seeds, only 0 to 3% of foliar-applied sulfate-S with
Epsom salts was utilized, while 33 to 35% of sulfur applied as elemental sulfur product (Thiovit)
was utilized (338). Foliar-supplied sulfate moved into leaves much faster than elemental sulfur and
was supposedly trapped in vacuoles so that it did not contribute to increased yield. The better results
with elemental sulfur were explained by the fact that it needs to be oxidized before signiﬁcant quan-
tities can be absorbed by leaves. As oxidation is slow, sulfate supply from foliar-applied elemental
sulfur ﬁts better to the metabolic demand of the leaves and avoids excess sulfate concentrations in
the cytosol and their deposition in vacuoles.

The problem of severe sulfur deﬁciency still exists on a large scale as the widespread regular
appearance of macroscopic symptoms reveal, even more than 20 years after addressing this nutri-
ent disorder (147). The reason is most likely the wide variation of oﬃcial sulfur fertilizer recom-
mendations in Europe (Table 7.11), recommendations, which only partly acknowledge site-speciﬁc
features and productional peculiarities.

On-farm experimentation employing precision agriculture tools would be an ideal approach for

setting up site-speciﬁc sulfur response curves (see Section 7.5.2 and (366)).

8.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION

8.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Boron (B) is one of the eight essential micronutrients, also called trace elements, required for the
normal growth of most plants. It is the only nonmetal among the plant micronutrients. Boron was
ﬁrst recognized as an essential element for plants early in the twentieth century. The essentiality of
boron  as  it  aﬀected  the  growth  of  maize  or  corn  (Zea  mays L.)  plants  was  ﬁrst  mentioned  by 
Maze (1) in France. However, it was the work of Warington (2) in England that secured strong evi-
dence  of  the  essentiality  of  boron  for  the  broad  bean  (Vicia  faba L.), and  later  Brenchley  and
Warington (3) extended the study of boron to include several other plant species. The essentiality
of  boron  to  higher  plants  was  decisively  accepted  after  the  experimental  work  of  Sommer  and
Lipman (4), Sommer (5), and other investigators who followed them.

Since its discovery as an essential trace element, the importance of boron as an agricultural chem-
ical has grown very rapidly. Its requirement diﬀers markedly within the plant kingdom. It is essential
for the normal growth of monocots, dicots, conifers, and ferns, but not for fungi and most algae. Some
members of Gramineae, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.) have a
much lower requirement for boron than do dicots and other monocots, for example, corn.

Of the known micronutrient deﬁciencies, boron deﬁciency in crops is most widespread. In the
last 80 years, hundreds of reports have dealt with the essentiality of boron for a variety of agricul-
tural crops in countries from every continent of the world.

8.1.2 FUNCTIONS IN PLANTS
Deﬁciency of boron can cause reductions in crop yields, impair crop quality, or have both eﬀects.
Some of the most severe disorders caused by a lack of boron include brown-heart (also called water
core  or  raan)  in  rutabaga  (Brassica  napobrassica Mill.)  and  radish  (Raphanus  sativus L.)  roots,
cracked stems of celery (Apium graveolens L.), heart rot of beets (Beta vulgaris L.) brown-heart of
cauliﬂower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.), and internal brown spots of sweet potato (Ipomoea
batatas Lam.). Some boron deﬁciency disorders appear to be physiological in nature and occur even
when boron is in ample supply. These disorders are thought to be related to peculiarities in boron
transport and distribution. The initial processes that control boron uptake in plants are located in the
roots (6). Some of the main functions of boron are summarized below.

8.1.2.1 Root Elongation and Nucleic Acid Metabolism
Boron deﬁciency rapidly inhibits the elongation and growth of roots. For example, Bohnsack and
Albert (7) showed that root elongation of squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) seedlings declined within 3 h
after the boron supply was removed and stopped within 24 h. If boron was resupplied after 12 h, the
rate of root elongation was restored to normal within 12 to18 h. Josten and Kutschera (8) reported
that the presence of boron resulted in the development of numerous roots in the lower part of the
hypocotyl in sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.) cuttings. Consequently, the numerous adventitious
roots entirely replaced the tap root system of the intact seedlings.

Root elongation is the result of cell elongation and cell division, and evidence suggests that
boron is required for both processes (9). When boron is withheld for several days, nucleic acid con-
tent decreases. Krueger et al. (10) demonstrated that the decline and eventual cessation of root elon-
gation  in  squash  seedlings  was  correlated  temporally  with  a  decrease  in  DNA  synthesis, but
preceded changes in protein synthesis and respiration.

Lenoble et al. (11) concluded that boron additions may need to be increased under acid, high-
aluminum soils, because applications of boron prevented aluminum inhibition of root growth on
acid, aluminum-toxic soils.

8.1.2.2 Protein, Amino Acid, and Nitrate Metabolism
Protein and soluble nitrogenous compounds are decreased in boron-deﬁcient plants (12). However,
the inﬂuence of organ age, i.e., whether the organ was actively involved in the biosynthesis of amino
acids and protein or remobilization of amino acids from protein reserves, has often been ignored
(13). For example, Dave and Kannan (14) reported that 5 days of growth without boron increased
the protein concentration of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cotyledons compared to control seedlings,
suggesting that nitrogen remobilization is hindered due to boron deﬁciency. By contrast, protein
concentrations in the actively growing regions could be reduced by lower rates of synthesis caused
by boron deﬁciency (15,16).

Shelp (16) reported that the partitioning of nitrogen into soluble components (nitrate, ammo-
nium, and amino acids) of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.) was dependent on the plant
organ and whether boron was supplied continuously at deﬁcient or toxic levels. Boron deﬁciency did
not substantially aﬀect the relative amino acid composition (16) but did enhance the proportion of
inorganic nitrogen, particularly nitrate, in plant tissues and translocation ﬂuids (13). A number of
researchers reported increases in nitrate concentration as well as corresponding decreases in nitrate
reductase  activity  in  sugar  beet  (Beta  vulgaris L.),
tomato  (Lycopersicon  esculentum Mill.),
sunﬂower, and corn plants (17,18) due to boron deﬁciency. Boron deﬁciency in tobacco (Nicotiana
tabacum L.) resulted in a decrease in leaf N concentration and reduced nitrate reductase activity (19).
Boron-deﬁcient soybeans (Glycine max Merr.) showed low acetylene reduction activities and dam-
age to the root nodules (20).

8.1.2.3 Sugar and Starch Metabolism
Boron is thought to have a direct eﬀect on sugar synthesis. In cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata Walp),
acute  boron  deﬁciency  conditions  increased  reducing  and  nonreducing  sugar  concentrations  but
decreased starch phosphorylase activity (21). Under boron deﬁciency, the pentose phosphate shunt
comes into operation to produce phenolic substances (22). Boron-deﬁcient sunﬂower seeds showed
marked decrease in nonreducing sugars and starch concentrations, whereas the reducing sugars accu-
mulated in the leaves (23). This ﬁnding indicates a speciﬁc role of boron in the production and dep-
osition of reserves in sunﬂower seeds. High concentrations of nonreducing sugars were also found
in  boron-deﬁcient  mustard  (Brassica  nigra Koch)  (24).  Camacho  and  Gonzalas  (19)  also  found
higher starch concentration in boron-deﬁcient tobacco plants. In low-boron sunﬂower leaves, starch
decreased, but there was an increase in sugars and protein and nonprotein nitrogen fractions (25). In

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 244

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

boron-deﬁcient pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves, the concentration of sugars and starch increased, but
they decreased in the pea seeds and thus lowered the seed quality (26). Evidence on the impact of
boron  deﬁciency  on  starch  concentration  is  conﬂicting.  It  is  diﬃcult  to  explain  whether  the
diﬀerences are due to a variation in crop species.

8.1.2.4 Auxin and Phenol Metabolism

Boron regulates auxin supply in plants by protecting the indole acetic acid (IAA) oxidase system
through  complexation  of  o-diphenol  inhibitors  of  IAA  oxidase.  Excessive  auxin  activity  causes
excessive proliferation of cambial cells, rapid and disproportionate enlargement of cells, and col-
lapse of nearby cells (27). It has been established that adventitious roots develop on stem cuttings
of bean only when boron is supplied (28,29). Auxin initiates the regeneration of roots, but boron
must be supplied at relatively high concentrations 40 to 48 h after cuttings are taken, for primordial
roots to develop and grow. It was initially proposed that boron acted by reducing auxin to concen-
trations  that  were  not  inhibitory  to  root  growth  (30,31), but  more  recently, Ali  and  Jarvis  (28)
reported that without boron, RNA synthesis decreases markedly within and outside the region from
which roots ultimately develop.

There  are  many  reports  in  the  literature  of  phenol  accumulation  under  long-term  boron
deﬁciency (32). Since boron complexes with phenolic compounds such as caﬀeic acid and hydrox-
yferulic acid, Lewis (33) proposed a role for boron in ligniﬁcation. Absence of boron would there-
fore  cause  reactive  intermediates  of  lignin  biosynthesis  and  other  phenolic  compounds  to  aﬀect
changes in metabolism and membrane function, resulting in cell damage. However, the available
evidence indicates that lignin synthesis may actually be enhanced by boron deﬁciency.

8.1.2.5 Flower Formation and Seed Production
The role of boron in seed production is so important that under moderate to severe boron deﬁciency,
plants fail to produce functional ﬂowers and may produce no seeds (34). Plants subjected to boron
deﬁciency have been observed to result in sterility or low germination of pollen in alfalfa (Medicago
sativa L.)  (35), barley  (Hordeum  vulgare L.)  (36), and  corn  (37).  Even  under  moderate  boron
deﬁciency, plants may grow normally and the yield of the foliage may not be aﬀected severely, but
the seed yield may be suppressed drastically (38).

8.1.2.6 Membrane Function
Impairment of membrane function could aﬀect the transport of all metabolites required for normal
growth  and  development, as  well  as  the  activities  of  membrane-bound  enzymes.  Dugger  (15)
summarized  early  reports  that  illustrate  changes  in  membrane  structure  and  organization  in
response  to  boron  deﬁciency.  Boron  may  give  stability  to  cellular  membranes  by  reacting  with
hydroxyl-rich compounds. Consistent with this view is evidence suggesting that a major portion
of the cellular boron is concentrated in protoplast membranes from mung bean (Phaseolus aureus
Roxb.) (39).

The involvement of boron in inorganic ion ﬂux by root tissue (40–42) and in the incorporation
of phosphate into organic phosphate (43) was evident from earlier research. In general, the absorp-
tion of phosphate, rubidium, sulfate, and chloride was suppressed in boron-deﬁcient root tissues,
but it could be restored to normal or nearly normal rates by a concomitant addition of boron or pre-
treatment with boron for 1 h. This eﬀect could be explained by a rapid reorganization of the carrier
system, with boron functioning as an essential component of the membrane (15). The movement of
monovalent cations is associated with membrane-bound ATPases. Boron-deﬁcient corn roots had a
limited ATPase  activity, which  could  be  restored  by  boron  addition  for  only  1 h  before  enzyme
extraction (40).

Recently, Tang and Dela Fuente (44,45) demonstrated that potassium leakage (as a measure of
membrane integrity) from boron- or calcium-deﬁcient sunﬂower hypocotyl segments was completely
reversed by the addition of boron or calcium for 3 h. It was not possible to reverse the inhibited
process by replacing one deﬁcient element with the other. Seedlings deﬁcient in both boron and cal-
cium showed greater eﬀects than seedlings deﬁcient in one element only. Basipetal auxin transport
was also inhibited by boron or calcium deﬁciency, but the addition of boron for 2 h did not restore
the  process  reduced  by  boron  deﬁciency.  This  reduction  in  auxin  transport  was  not  related  to
reduced growth rate, acropetal auxin transport, lack of respiratory substrates, or changes in calcium
absorption, suggesting that boron had a direct eﬀect on auxin transport.

8.2 FORMS AND SOURCES OF BORON IN SOILS

8.2.1 TOTAL BORON
The total boron content of most agricultural soils ranges from 1 to 467 mg kg⫺1, with an average
content  of  9  to  85 mg  kg⫺1.  Gupta  (46)  reported  that  total  boron  on  Podzol  soils  from  eastern
Canada ranged from 45 to 124 mg kg⫺1. Total boron in major soil orders, Inceptisol and Alﬁsol, in
India ranged from 8 to 18 mg kg⫺1 (47). Such wide variations among soils in the total boron con-
tent are mainly ascribed to the parent rock types and soil types falling under divergent geographi-
cal and climatic zones. Boron is generally high in soils derived from marine sediments.

8.2.2 AVAILABLE BORON
Available boron, measured by various extraction methods (see Section 8.6.2), in agricultural soils
varies from 0.5 to 5 mg kg⫺1. Most of the available boron in soil is believed to be derived from sed-
iments and plant material. Gupta (46) reported that available boron on Podzol soils from eastern
Canada ranged from 0.38 to 4.67 mg kg⫺1. Few studies have been conducted that attempt to iden-
tify solid-phase controls on boron solubility in soils. Most of the common boron minerals are much
too soluble for such purposes (48).

8.2.3 FRACTIONATION OF SOIL BORON
Boron fractionation was studied in relation to its availability to corn in 14 soils (49). Up to 0.34%
of the total boron was in a water-soluble form, 0 to 0.23% was nonspeciﬁcally adsorbed (exchange-
able), and 0.05 to 0.30% was speciﬁcally adsorbed. Jin et al. (49) reported that most of the boron
available  to  corn  was  in  these  three  forms, and  that  boron  in  noncrystalline  and  crystalline  alu-
minum and iron oxyhydroxides and in silicates was relatively unavailable for plant uptake. For the
identiﬁcation of diﬀerent pools of boron in soils, Hou et al. (50) proposed a fractionation scheme,
which indicated that readily soluble and speciﬁcally adsorbed boron accounted for ⬍2% of the total
boron. Various oxides–hydroxides, and organically bound forms constituted 2.3 and 8.6%, respec-
tively. Most soil boron existed in residual or occluded form. Recent studies by Zerrari et al. (51)
showed that the residual boron constituted the most important fraction at 78.75%.

8.2.4 SOIL SOLUTION BORON
In  soil  solution, boron  mainly  exists  as  undissociated  acid  H3BO3.  Boric  acid  (also  written  as
⫺ are the most common geologic forms of boron, with boric acid being the pre-
B(OH)3) and H2BO3
dominant form in soils as reviewed by Evans and Sparks (52). They further reported that boric acid
⫺ being predominant only above pH 9.2. In their
is the major form of boron in soils with H2BO3
review, they stated that boron occurs in aqueous solution as boric acid B(OH)3, which is a weak
monobasic acid that acts as an electron acceptor or as a Lewis acid.

8.2.5 TOURMALINE
In most of the well-drained soils formed from acid rocks and metamorphic sediments, tourmaline
is the most common boron-containing mineral identiﬁed (53). The name tourmaline represents a
group of minerals that are compositionally complex borosilicates containing approximately 3%
B. The tourmaline structure has rhombohedral symmetry and consists of linked sheets of island
units. The boron atoms are found within BO3 triangles, forming strong covalent B–O bonds (54).
Tourmalines are highly resistant to weathering and virtually insoluble. Additions of ﬁnely ground
tourmaline to soil failed to provide suﬃcient boron to alleviate boron deﬁciency of crop plants (55).

8.2.6 HYDRATED BORON MINERALS
Industrial deposits of boron are usually produced by chemical precipitation. Precipitation occurs
following concentration on land, in brine waters in arid regions or as terrestrial evaporites and arid
playa deposits (56). Precipitation also occurs as marine evaporites after concentration due to evap-
oration of seawater. Borates also form in salt domes and by further concentration of underground
water in arid areas (56). The borate deposits of economic importance are restricted to arid areas
because of the high solubility of these minerals.

Hydrated borates are formed originally as chemical deposits in saline lakes (57). The particular
mineral suite formed is dependent on the chemical composition of the lake. Two kinds of borate
deposits  are  formed  in  the  arid  western  United  States  (57).  Hydrated  sodium  borates  form  from
lakes  that  have  a  high  pH  and  that  are  high  in  sodium  and  low  in  calcium  content.  Hydrated
sodium–calcium borates form from lakes of higher calcium content.

8.3 DIAGNOSIS OF BORON STATUS IN PLANTS
Boron deﬁciency in crops is more widespread than deﬁciency of any other micronutrient. This phe-
nomenon is the chief reason why numerous reports are available on boron deﬁciency symptoms in
plants. Because of its immobility in plants, boron deﬁciency symptoms generally appear ﬁrst on the
younger  leaves  at  the  top  of  the  plants. This  occurrence  is  also  true  of  the  other  micronutrients
except molybdenum, which is readily translocated.

Boron toxicity symptoms are similar for most plants. Generally, they consist of marginal and
tip chlorosis, which is quickly followed by necrosis (58). As far as boron toxicity is concerned, it
occurs chieﬂy under two conditions, owing to its presence in irrigation water or owing to acciden-
tal applications of too much boron in treating boron deﬁciency. Large additions of materials high in
boron, for example, compost, can also result in boron toxicity in crops (59,60). Boron toxicity in
arid and semiarid regions is frequently associated with saline soils, but most often it results from
the use of high-boron irrigation waters. In the United States, the main areas of high-boron waters
are along the west side of the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys in California (61).

Boron does not accumulate uniformly in leaves, but typically concentrates in leaf tips of mono-
cotyledons and leaf margins of dicotyledons, where boron toxicity symptoms  ﬁrst appear. In fact
although leaf tips may represent only a small proportion of the shoot dry matter, they can contain
suﬃcient boron to substantially inﬂuence total leaf and shoot boron concentrations. To overcome this
problem, Nable et al. (62) recommended the use of grain in barley for monitoring toxic levels of
boron accumulation. The main diﬃculty in using cereal grain for determining boron levels is the
small diﬀerences in the grain boron concentration as obtained in response to boron fertilization (63).
Low risk of boron toxicity to rice in an oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)–rice (Oryza sativa L.) rota-
tion was attributed to the relatively high boron removal in harvested seed, grain, and stubble, and the
loss  of  fertilizer  boron  to  leaching  (64).  Boron  toxicity  symptoms  in  zinc-deﬁcient  citrus  (Citrus
aurantium L.) could be mitigated with zinc applications. This ﬁnding is of practical importance as
boron toxicity and zinc deﬁciencies are simultaneously encountered in some soils of semiarid zones.

8.3.1 DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS

247

8.3.1.1 Field and Horticultural Crops
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Symptoms are more severe at the leaf tips, although the lower leaves
remain a healthy green color. Flowers fail to form, and buds appear as white or light-brown tissue (65).
Internodes are short; blossoms drop or do not form, and stems are short (66). Younger leaves turn red
or yellow (67,68), and topyellowing of alfalfa occurs (69) (Figure 8.1).

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). No ears are formed (70). Flowers were opened by the swelling
of ovaries caused by partial sterility due to B deﬁciency (36). Boron deﬁciency was also associated
with the appearance of ergot.

Beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Boron deﬁciency results in a characteristic corky upper surface of the

leaf petiole (69). Beet roots are rough, scabby (similar to potato scab) and oﬀ-color (71).

Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.). Water-soaked areas occur inside the heads, and
callus formation is slower on the cut end of the stems after the heads have been harvested (72).
Symptoms of boron deﬁciency included leaf midrib cracking, stem corkiness, necrotic lesions, and
hollowing in the stem pith (73).

Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera Zenker). The ﬁrst signs of boron deﬁciency
are swellings on the stem and petioles, which later become suberised. The leaves are curled and rolled,
and premature leaf fall of the older leaves may take place (58). The sprouts themselves are very loose
instead of being hard and compact, and there is vertical cracking of the stem (74).

Carrot (Daucus  carota L.).  Boron  deﬁciency  results  in  longitudinal  splitting  of  roots  (75).
Boron-deﬁcient carrot roots are rough, small with a distinct white core in the center and plants show
a browning of the tops (71).

Cauliﬂower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.). The chief symptoms are the tardy production
of small heads, which display brown, waterlogged patches, the vertical cracking of the stems, and
rotting of the core (74) (Figure 8.2). When browning is severe, the outer and the inner portions of the
head have a bitter ﬂavor (76). Stems are stiﬀ, with hollow cores, and curd formation is delayed (77).
The roots are rough and dwarfed; lesions appear in the pith, and a loose curd is produced (69).

Clover (Trifolium spp.). Plants are weak, with thick stems that are swollen close to the grow-
ing point, and leaf margins often look burnt (78). Symptoms of boron deﬁciency in red and alsike
clover may occur as a red coloration on the margins and tips of younger leaves; the coloration grad-
ually spreads over the leaves, and the leaf tips may die (65).

brown, waterlogged patches, and rotting of the core of the head. (Photograph by Umesh C. Gupta.) (For a color
presentation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

Corn (Zea  mays L.).  Boron  deﬁciency  is  seen  on  the  youngest  leaves  as  white, irregularly
shaped spots scattered between the veins. With severe deﬁciency these spots may coalesce, form-
ing white stripes 2.5 to 5.0 cm long. These stripes appear to be waxy and raised from the leaf sur-
face (79). Interruption in the boron supply, from 1 week prior to tasselling until maturity, curtailed
the normal development of the corn ear (80).

Oat (Avena sativa L.). Pollen grains are empty (70).
Peanuts or  groundnut (Arachis  hypogaea L.).  Boron  deﬁciency  resulted  in  hollow-heart  in

peanut kernels at a few locations in Thailand (81).

Pea (Pisum sativum L.). Leaves develop yellow or white veins followed by some changes in
interveinal  areas;  growing  points  die  and  blossoms  shed  (82).  Unpublished  data  of  Gupta  and
MacLeod (83) showed that boron deﬁciency in peas resulted in short internodes and small, shriv-
elled new leaves.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Deﬁciency results in the death of growing points, with short
internodes giving the plant a bushy appearance. Leaves thicken and margins roll upward, a symp-
tom similar to that of potato leaf roll virus (84). Boron deﬁciency resulted in rosetting of terminal
buds and shoots, and the new leaves were malformed and chlorotic (85).

Radish (Raphanus  sativus L.).  Deﬁciency  of  boron  in  radish  is  also  known  as  brown-heart,
manifested ﬁrst by dark spots on the roots, usually on the thickest parts (76). Roots upon cutting
show brown coloration and have thick periderm (71).

Rutabaga (Brassica napobrassica Mill.). The boron deﬁciency disorder in rutabaga is generally
referred  to  as  brown-heart.  Upon  cutting, the  roots  show  a  soft, watery  area  (Figure  8.3).  Under
severe boron deﬁciency the surface of the roots is rough and netted, and often the roots are elongated
(86). The roots are tough, ﬁbrous, and bitter, and have a corky and somewhat leathery skin (58).

Snapbean (Phaseolus  vulgaris L.).  There  is  a  yellowing  of  tops, slow  ﬂowering  and  pod 

formation (71).

Soybean (Glycine max Merr.). Boron deﬁciency results in necrosis of the apical growing point
and young growth; the lamina is thick and brittle; and ﬂoral buds wither before opening (87). Boron

accompanying compact disc.)

deﬁciency induced a localized depression on the internal surface of one or both cotyledons of some
seeds and resembled the symptoms of hollow-heart in groundnut seeds (88).

Sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.). There is basal fading and distortion of young leaves with

soaked areas and tissue necrosis (25).

Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.). The growing point is injured; ﬂower injury occurs dur-
ing the early stages of blossoming, and fruits are imperfectly ﬁlled (72). Failure to set fruit is com-
mon, and the fruit may be ridged, show corky patches, and ripen unevenly.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A normal ear forms but fails to ﬂower (70). In the case of severe

boron deﬁciency, the development of the inﬂorescence and setting of grains are restricted (87).

8.3.1.2 Other Crops
Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Boron deﬁciency causes retarded internodal growth (89). The ter-
minal bud often dies, checking linear growth, and short internodes and enlarged nodes give a bushy
appearance that is referred to as a rosette condition (90). Bolls are deformed and reduced in size.
Root growth is severely inhibited, and secondary roots have a stunted appearance (91).

Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Deﬁciency results in retarded growth, and young leaves curl and
turn black (92). The old leaves show surface cracking, along with cupping and curling. When the
growing point fails completely, it forms a heart rot (92).

Tobacco (Nicotiana  tabacum L.).  Boron  deﬁciency  results  in  interveinal  chlorosis, dark  and
brittle newly emerging leaves, water-soaked areas in leaves, and delayed ﬂowering, and formation
of seedless pods (93). Tissues at the base of the leaf show signs of breakdown, and the stalk toward
the top of the plant may show a distorted or twisted type of growth. The death of the terminal bud
follows these stages (94).

8.3.2 TOXICITY SYMPTOMS

8.3.2.1 Field and Horticultural Crops
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Boron toxicity is marked by
burnt edges on the older leaves (67,68) (Figure 8.4).

of lower leaves. (Photograph by Umesh C. Gupta.) (For a color presentation of this figure, see the accompa-
nying compact disc.)

Barley (Hordeum  vulgare L.).  Boron  toxicity  is  characterized  by  elongated, dark-brown
blotches at the tips of older leaves (79). Severe browning, spotting, and burning of older leaf tips
occur, gradually extending to the middle portion of the leaf (59,63). There is a reduced shoot growth
and increased leaf senescence (95).

Corn (Zea mays L.). Leaves show tip burn and marginal burning and yellowing between the

veins (79,96). Burning of older leaf edges is more prominent (71).

Cowpea (Vigna sinensis Savi). Moderate boron toxicity results in marginal chlorosis and spot-
ted necrosis, but under severe boron toxicity, trifoliate leaves show a slight marginal chlorosis (97).

Oat (Avena sativa L.). Boron toxicity in oats results in light-yellow bleached leaf tips (63).
Onion (Allium  cepa L.).  Boron  toxicity  results  in  burning  of  the  tips  of  leaves, gradually

increasing up to the base, and no development of bulb occurs (93).

Pea (Pisum sativum L.). Boron toxicity results in suppression of plant height and in the num-
ber of nodes (98). Unpublished data of Gupta and MacLeod (83) showed that boron toxicity results
in burning of the edges of old leaves.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Boron toxicity symptoms include arching mid-rib and down-

ward cupping of leaves and necrosis at leaf margins (85).

Rutabaga (Brassica napobrassica Mill.). The leaf margins are yellow in color and tend to curl
and wrinkle. The symptoms on roots are similar to moderate boron deﬁciency symptoms—a water-
soaked appearance of the tissues in the center of the root (99). Boron toxicity in turnip seedlings
also results in marginal bleaching of the cotyledons and ﬁrst leaves (100).

Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Boron toxicity results in marginal chlorosis of the older trifoli-
ate  leaves  of  snapbeans;  unifoliate  leaves  are  also  chlorotic  with  intermittent  marginal  necrosis
(97). Growth is suppressed, and old leaves have marginal burning (71). With faba beans (Vicia faba
L.), stem growth was restricted, and the young leaves were wrinkled, thick, with a dark-blue color
(101).

Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne). Slight boron toxicity was associated with mar-
ginal curling and interveinal bronzing and necrotic lesions. Under severe boron toxicity interveinal
necrosis was severe, leaf margins became severely distorted and cracked, and overall plant growth
was reduced (102).

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Boron toxicity in wheat appears as light browning of older leaf
tips converging into light greenish-blue spots (63). In durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), toxic-
ity  results  in  retarded  growth, delayed  heading, increase  in  aborted  tillers, and  suppressed  grain
yield per tiller (103).

8.3.2.2 Other Crops
Bajri (Pennisetum typhoideum). Boron toxicity results in the burning of leaf tips. On the basal leaves,
small necrotic areas appear at the margins and proceed slowly toward the top of the plant (93).

Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Excess boron causes mottled and necrotic areas on the leaves,
especially along the leaf margins (91). In faba bean (Vicia faba L.), symptoms ﬁrst appeared as yel-
lowing of the mature foliage, followed by a marginal necrosis and ﬁnally by the death of the whole
plant (101).

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Boron toxicity results in brown circular spots on the periph-

ery of the leaves, and stunted growth (93).

8.4 BORON CONCENTRATION IN CROPS

8.4.1 PLANT PART AND GROWTH STAGE
As extractants have not been developed fully to evaluate the availability of boron in soils, plant
tissue  testing  continues  to  be  the  preferred  means  of  delineating  the  boron  deﬁciency  and
suﬃciency levels in plants. It seems, therefore, desirable to sample the plant parts that contain the
highest quantity of boron to characterize its status in crops. The use of plant parts containing the
higher  nutrient  values  should  facilitate  better  diﬀerentiation  between  the  deﬁciency  and
suﬃciency levels.

The part of the leaf, its position in the plant, the plant age, and the plant part are some of the
factors that aﬀect the boron composition of plants. Studies by Vlamis and Ulrich (92) showed that
young blades of sugar beets contained more boron than the mature and old blades of plants grown
at low concentrations of boron in a nutrient solution. However, at higher boron concentrations in
solution, no diﬀerences were found. The highest boron values in sugar beets occurred in the older
leaves, but the lowest boron content occurred in the ﬁbrous and storage roots (92). The boron con-
centration of corn leaves increased with age in seedling leaves (104). The uppermost corn leaves
had higher concentrations than did leaves at positions below. Boron concentration in corn leaves
and tassels of ﬂowering corn plants increased with age, but boron in other plant parts remained low
and relatively constant (105). Gorsline et al. (106) noted that boron concentration in the whole corn
plant decreased during initial growth, remained unchanged during most of the vegetative period,
and then decreased after silking.

Gupta and Cutcliﬀe (86) reported that boron level in leaf tissue of rutabaga was greater from
early samplings than it was from late samplings. Older cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) leaves con-
tained more boron than the younger leaves; and within the leaf, boron accumulated in the marginal
parts  (107).  Boron  accumulation  was  greater  in  the  marginal  section  of  corn  leaves  than  in  the
midrib  section  (108).  Generally, boron  in  plants  has  a  tendency  to  accumulate  in  the  margin  of
leaves (109,110). Results of Miller and Smith (111) showed that alfalfa leaves had much higher
boron content (75 to 98 mg kg⫺1) than tips (47 mg kg⫺1) or stems (22 to 27 mg kg⫺1).

In a ﬁeld study conducted in Prince Edward Island, Canada, the highest boron concentrations
were in leaves and upper halves of plants of most species (Table 8.1). The boron concentrations
were lowest in the stems. The lowest boron concentration was in alfalfa and the highest in Brussels
sprouts and rutabaga. In a separate experiment, where the eﬀect of not applying boron was studied
against applied boron, the trend in boron accumulation in the various plant parts was similar. The
boron content of pistils and stamens, although very high, was often lower than in leaves and some-
times of corollas (112).

Gupta (113) found that without added boron, the bottom third of the leaves of alfalfa and red
clover  contained  signiﬁcantly  higher  boron  than  did  the  upper  leaves.  In  the  case  of  stems  the
opposite  was  the  case, i.e., the  upper  third  of  the  stems  contained  more  boron  than  the  bottom
third. This trend was similar for the unfertilized and boron-fertilized areas for leaves; however, in

the presence of added boron, diﬀerences in the boron content in the upper and lower stems were
not signiﬁcant.

The  general  theory  is  that  boron  translocates  readily  in  the  xylem, but  once  in  the  leaves, it
becomes one of the least mobile of the micronutrients. Thus the boron immobility in leaves in terms
of localized cyclic movement prevents escape and transport of this element over long distances (114).
The results of Shelp (115) have also shown that younger leaves contain less boron than mature leaves;
the authors assumed that the boron supply for mature leaves is delivered principally via the xylem.

The fact that boron deﬁciency exhibits in the younger leaves and not in the older leaves can be
explained by the fact that the boron concentration is higher in the older leaves than in the younger
leaves, as reported for alfalfa and red clover (113) and for broccoli (115). Since the boron concen-
tration in the upper leaves was easily increased with boron fertilization (113), boron deﬁciency is
controlled without much diﬃculty using boron applications.

It is suggested that leaves should be sampled to determine the boron status of the plants. Also,
it is important to be consistent with the plant sampling technique in the ﬁeld as well as the plant
part sampled.

8.4.2 BORON REQUIREMENT OF SOME CROPS
Diﬀerent crops have diﬀerent requirements for boron; for example, rutabaga needs more boron than
wheat.  Boron  requirement  for  crops  varies  considerably, and  therefore  boron  recommendations
must take these diﬀerences into account. A classiﬁcation of a number of ﬁeld and horticultural crops
as having high, medium, or low boron requirement is given in Table 8.2.

8.5 BORON LEVELS IN PLANTS
Often when one talks about deﬁcient, suﬃcient, and toxic levels of nutrients in crops, there is a
range in values rather than one deﬁnite number that could be considered as critical. Therefore, the

workers in one area may not be considered critical in another area. Likewise, the term optimum level
of a nutrient, as used in the literature by some researchers to express a relationship to maximum
crop  yield, is  sometimes  not  clear.  Theoretically, such  a  level  for  a  given  nutrient  should  be
suﬃcient to produce the best possible growth of a crop. A range of values would be more appro-
priate to describe the nutrient status of the crop; therefore, the term suﬃciency will be used, rather
than critical or optimum.

The critical level of a nutrient has been deﬁned as the concentration occurring in a speciﬁc
plant part at 90% of the maximum yield (117). The concept is equally valid where crop quality is
the main concern rather than yield (118). In this respect, rutabaga is an excellent example where
deﬁciency of boron may not aﬀect the mass of roots, but the quality of roots may be seriously
impaired.

The ratio of toxic level to adequate level of boron is smaller than that for most other nutrient
elements (119). Thus, excessive or deﬁcient levels could be encountered in a crop during a single
season. This occurrence emphasizes the fact that a critical value used to indicate the status of boron
in  crops  would  be  unsuitable.  In  many  cases  the  values  referred  to  in  this  section  overlap  the
deﬁciency and suﬃciency ranges.

The deﬁcient, suﬃcient, and toxic boron levels for speciﬁc crops as reported by various work-
ers are given in Table 8.3. The deﬁcient and toxic levels of boron as reported in this table are asso-
ciated  with  plant  disorders  and  suppressions  of  crop  yields.  For  some  crops, the  deﬁciency  and
optimum levels seem to diﬀer markedly. Diﬀerences in the techniques used and the locations of the
various laboratories cannot be ruled out.

8.6 SOIL TESTING FOR BORON

8.6.1 SAMPLING OF SOILS FOR ANALYSIS
Agricultural soils can be sampled by removing subsamples from uniform land areas to a depth of
15 to 20 cm. Uniform areas generally have similar soils and slopes, and do not include washed-out
areas, bottomlands, or other dissimilar areas. Soil subsamples should be placed in a plastic container
to avoid contamination and mixed together thoroughly. Generally, 25 to 50 subsamples per hectare
are suﬃcient to obtain a representation of the soil.

8.6.2 EXTRACTION OF AVAILABLE BORON
Most procedures for extracting available boron from acid and alkaline soils are similar. The colori-
metric and other methods of determining boron in the soil extract remain the same for testing on
acid and alkaline soils. Methods have been extensively reviewed by Bingham (151). There are a
number of methods for extracting available boron from soils (151). The most common extractant is
hot water because soil solution boron is most important with regard to plant uptake. Hot water and
other common extractants will be discussed in this section.

8.6.2.1 Hot-Water-Extractable Boron

The measurement of hot-water-soluble boron is a very popular method for determining available
boron. Berger and Truog (152) established a hot-water method for determining available boron in
soil that served as a reliable indicator of plant-available boron; however, the method was time-con-
suming. Additional modiﬁcations were made by Dible et al. (153), Baker (154), Wear (155), Jeﬀery
and McCallum (156), and methods were summarized by Bingham (151).

Gupta  (157)  further  modiﬁed  the  hot-water  procedure  by  extracting  soils  with  boiling  water
directly on a hot plate. Boron is then determined in the ﬁltrates by a carmine colorimetric method
(157) or by an azomethine-H procedure (158). However, Gupta found that a cooling period of more
than 10 min before ﬁltering the hot-water extracts resulted in slightly less recovery of boron. Yellow
coloration that appears in some soil extracts interferes with the Azomethine-H procedure. The pos-
itive  error  due  to  yellow  coloration  can  be  reduced  by  reﬂuxing  soils  in  10 mM  CaCl2.  If  the 

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 258

258

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

yellow color persists, the addition of not more than 0.16 g of charcoal per sample should be used. Too
much  charcoal  tends  to  adsorb  boron  and  reduce  measured  boron  values  (159,160).  Gupta  (158)
reported that quantities of more than 0.8 g charcoal were necessary on soils containing more than
4.1% organic matter.

Extraction  of  hot-water-soluble  boron  is  the  most  eﬀective  way  to  evaluate  available  boron  to
plants in most agricultural soils. Generally in the soil solution, less than 0.2 mg B L⫺1 is considered
deﬁcient for crops, whereas greater than 1 mg L⫺1 is considered toxic (161). On a soil mass basis, less
than 1 mg B kg⫺1 is considered marginal for boron-sensitive crops whereas greater than 5 mg B kg⫺1
is considered toxic (119).

8.6.2.2 Boron from Saturated Soil Extracts
Saturation extracts of soils generally contain 0.1 to 10 mg B L⫺1. The main advantage of a satura-
tion extract is that it is easier to obtain than hot-water-soluble boron. Since the amount extracted by
this method is less than that by hot-water extraction, this procedure has an advantage in determin-
ing the boron availability in toxic boron soils but would be less useful in soils containing low quan-
tities of boron.

8.6.2.3 Other Soil Chemical Extractants
Li and Gupta (162) compared hot water, 0.05 M HCl, 1.5 M CH3COOH, and hot 0.01 M CaCl2 solu-
tion  as  boron  extractants  in  relation  to  boron  accumulation  by  soybean, red  clover, alfalfa, and
rutabaga. They concluded that 0.05 M HCl solution was the best extractant (r ⫽ 0.82) followed by
1.5 M CH3COOH (r ⫽ 0.78), hot water (r ⫽ 0.66), and hot 0.01 M CaCl2 solution (r ⫽ 0.61) for pre-
dicting the available boron status of acid soils. Aitken et al. (163) stated that hot water as well as hot
0.01 M CaCl2 solution were far superior to mannitol and glycerol methods as a predictive test for
plant boron requirement. They added that the levels of boron extracted with mannitol and glycerol
were low compared to those displaced from the soil by the reﬂuxing procedures. They suggested 
that  mannitol  would  not  be  an  eﬀective  extractant  for  boron  in  acid  soils.  Tsadilas  et  al.  (164),
working  on  high-boron  soils, found  that  hot-water-soluble, 0.05 M  mannitol  in  0.1 M  CaCl2-
extractable, 0.05 M HCl-soluble, and resin-extractable boron strongly correlated with each other.
The coeﬃcients of boron determination improved when the soil pH and clay content were included
in the regression equation.

Mineral acid extraction of boron, especially with sulfuric acid, creates a number of problems
for detection by complexing agents before the introduction of azomethine-H. Baker (165) found
that phosphoric acid was a less suitable extractant than hot water for assessing the amount of soil
boron available to sunﬂower during a short growing period. Gupta (166) found that sulfuric acid
extraction  of  soils  leads  to  high  boron  values  due  to  interference  with  absorbance  of  the  boron
carmine  complex.  The  HCl  extracts  were  ﬁltered  easily, and  no  interference  was  encountered.
Furthermore, the  percentage  recovery  of  added  boron  to  soils  was  good  and  reproducible  when
extracted with 6 M HCl. No boron was lost when 6 M acid solutions were heated for 2 h at 100⬚C
in a hot-water bath.

Another  extractant, ammonium  bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic  acid  (AB-DTPA),
was suggested for determining boron in alkaline soils. The resultant ﬁltrate is analyzed by induc-
tively-coupled plasma spectroscopy (167). The AB-DTPA extractant has proven eﬀective for deter-
mining boron and other nutrients on alkaline soils. It has been shown that this soil test alone was not
as eﬀective as the hot-water extractant in assessing boron availability to alfalfa (167). This soil test
required the inclusion of percentage clay, organic matter, and soil pH to be eﬀective. Gestring and
Solanpour (168) further improved the AB-DTPA extractant on alkaline soils (pH 7.3 to 8.4) by the
inclusion of ammonium acetate-extractable calcium into the regression equation of soil boron ver-
sus crop yield. This addition resulted in signiﬁcantly increased correlation from r2 ⫽ 0.50 to 0.77,

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 259

Boron

259

suggesting a possible eﬀect of calcium in boron toxicity. Studies conducted by Matsi et al. (169)
showed that the AB-DTPA-extractable boron was signiﬁcantly greater than the saturated extract and
similar to the hot-water extract, and was correlated signiﬁcantly with hot-water or with saturation
extracts.  They  included  cation-exchange  capacity  in  the  regression  equation  for  boron
determination.

Correlating an extractant for boron with plant growth is a key for determining the eﬀectiveness
of that extractant. The hot-water extraction method appears to be the most eﬀective procedure for
assessing B availability to plants on alkaline soils.

8.6.3 DETERMINATION OF EXTRACTED BORON
Several techniques are available to determine boron in soil extracts. Titrimetric, ﬂuorometric, and
bioassay methods were used earlier but are not commonly used now. In general, they are time-
consuming, and  some  interferences  are  encountered.  Colorimetric  and  spectrometric  methods,
which are more common, reliable, and accurate, will be discussed here.

8.6.3.1 Colorimetric Methods

Colorimetric methods for B determination are relatively inexpensive to perform and are somewhat
free of interferences. The turmeric test (170,171) showed some promise earlier when it was discov-
ered that dilute solutions of boric acid will change the color of turmeric paper from yellow to red.
The procedure however, was long and required the precise control of temperature-regulated water
baths. Berger and Truog (152) reported that the use of the turmeric paper test led to great diﬃculty
because of its insensitivity due to its inability to diﬀerentiate between small amounts of boron.

The quinalizarine method is less laborious and more expeditious, whereas the curcumin method has
the advantage of using easily prepared and easier to handle reagents (172). According to Berger (173),
the mixing of 98% sulfuric acid–quinalizarin solution with the unknown solution generates a con-
siderable amount of heat, and it was found that the higher the temperature, the redder is the color
of the test solution. It was suggested that the solution be cooled to room temperature regardless of
the temperature reached when the solutions were mixed. So it was possible and convenient to read
unknown solutions in a colorimeter at a uniform temperature.

Porter et al. (174) saw the introduction of azomethine-H method as an answer to the handling
diﬃculty involved in working with sulfuric acid for the carmine method. They added that the prob-
lem of having to concentrate boron in the solution of low boron concentration was also avoided.
They concluded that an automated scheme improved the azomethine-H reagent method by over-
coming the eﬀect of sample color by dialysis.

Wolf (175) concluded that the results of boron determination using the azomethine-H method
were in agreement with those of the curcumin method, and probably more reliable for soils high in
nitrate. Also, the azomethine-H results (values) for plant boron agreed more closely with spectro-
graphic analysis than the curcumin. Gestring and Soltanpour (176) found that the azomethine-H
colorimetric  method  and  inductively  coupled  plasma-atomic  emission  spectrophotometer  (ICP)
analysis  were  highly  correlated.  Both  methods  of  analysis  gave  boron  values  comparable  to
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) values for dry-ashed plant samples; however, wet digestion
using concentrated nitric acid resulted in interferences for the azomethine-H method but not for the
ICP analysis.

8.6.3.2 Spectrometric Methods

The suitability (177) of the ICP spectrometer system for analysis of complex matrices was demon-
strated by the high analytical precision and reproducibility of boron in alfalfa and in white bean
(Phaseolus coccineus cv. Albus) (NBS samples). There was no interference from soluble organics

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 260

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

observed in the complex soil solution matrices examined, although their presence would confound any
colorimetric technique. It was possible to quantify boron in soil solutions to levels of 5 to 15 ng mL⫺1,
with extended integration periods utilizing the 249.773 nm emission line.

Parker and Gardner (178) employed ICP emission spectroscopic analysis of boron in distilled
water and 0.02 M CaCl2 solution, and indicated that the extractable boron level was not aﬀected by
the presence of CaCl2. According to John et al. (179) the ICP method has the following advantages
over the present colorimetric techniques: (a) carbon black is not needed since the color of the solu-
tion does not aﬀect the analysis; (b) nitric acid digestion of samples can be utilized since ICP is not
aﬀected  by  the  presence  of  nitrates;  (c)  other  elements  can  be  determined  simultaneously;  and 
(d) analysis by ICP is simple and rapid.

The use of Mehlich 3 extractant has been found to be simple, rapid, and practical in determin-
ing  the  availability  of  boron  and  a  number  of  other  nutrients  in  soils  (180)  with  the  ICP  spec-
trophotometer.  Using  the  ICP  method, the  Mehlich  3-extracted  boron  is  well  correlated  with
hot-water-soluble boron. The clear  ﬁltered extract (after shaking soil, Mehlich 3 reagent in 1:10
ratio  for  5  min  at  80  oscillations/min)  is  transferred  into  ICP  tubes  and  analyzed  by  ICP  at
249.678 nm (181). The ICP atomic emission spectrometry has also been used successfully in the
determination of total soil B (182).

8.7 FACTORS AFFECTING PLANT ACCUMULATION OF BORON

8.7.1 SOIL FACTORS

8.7.1.1 Soil Acidity, Calcium, and Magnesium
Soil reaction or soil pH is an important factor aﬀecting availability of boron in soils. Generally,
boron becomes less available to plants with increasing soil pH. Several workers have observed neg-
ative correlations between plant boron accumulation and soil pH (67,183–185). In some studies in
New  Zealand, liming  of  the  soil  reduced  boron  concentration  in  the  ﬁrst  cuts  of  alfalfa  and  red
clover, particularly at higher rates of applied boron (123). Studies by Peterson and Newman (186)
and Gupta and MacLeod (187) have shown that a negative relationship between soil pH and plant
boron occurs when soil pH levels are greater than 6.3 to 6.5. The availability of boron to plants
decreases sharply at higher pH levels, but the relationship between soil pH and plant boron at soil
pH values below 6.5 does not show a deﬁnite trend.

Liming of soil decreased the plant boron accumulation when soil boron reserves were high (188).
They attributed this eﬀect to a high calcium content. Beauchamp and Hussain (189) in their studies
on rutabagas, found that increased calcium concentration in tissue generally increased the incidence
of brown-heart. Wolf (185) found that magnesium had a greater eﬀect on boron reduction in plants
than did calcium, sodium, or potassium, but the diﬀerences between calcium and magnesium eﬀects
were small. However, no distinction was made between the eﬀects of soil pH and levels of calcium
or magnesium on boron accumulation.

Experiments conducted to distinguish between the eﬀects of soil pH and sources of calcium and
magnesium showed that, in the absence of added boron, rutabaga roots and tops from calcium and
magnesium carbonate treatments had more severe brown-heart condition than did roots from cal-
cium and magnesium sulfate treatments (187). The leaf boron concentrations in rutabaga from treat-
ments with no boron were lower at higher soil pH values where calcium or magnesium were applied
as carbonates than they were at lower soil pH where sulfate was used as a source of calcium or mag-
nesium (Table 8.4). In the presence of added boron, this trend was not clear, but the levels were well
above the deﬁciency limit. The lower boron concentrations in the no-boron treatments with car-
bonates than in those with sulfates appear to be related to soil pH diﬀerences. These studies (187)
showed no diﬀerences in boron accumulation whether the plants were fed with calcium or magne-
sium, as long as the corresponding anionic components were the same. Concentrations of calcium

and magnesium, not shown in the table, were not related to the applications of boron. Table 8.4
shows that after the crop was harvested, lower quantities of hot-water-soluble boron were found in
the soil that received calcium or magnesium sulfates than in soil that received calcium or magne-
sium carbonates.

Unpublished  data  (83)  on  podzol  soils  with  a  pH  range  of  5.4  to  7.8  showed  that  liming
markedly decreased the boron content of pea plant tissue from 117 to 198 mg kg⫺1 at pH 5.4 to 5.6,
to 36 to 43 mg kg⫺1 at pH 7.3 to 7.5. At pH values higher than 7.3 to 7.5, even tripling the amount
of lime did not aﬀect the boron content of plant tissue.

No clear relationship was found between the Ca/B ratio in the leaf blades and the incidence of
brown-heart in rutabaga (189). However, it was noted that an application of sodium increased the
calcium concentration in rutabaga tissue, thereby aﬀecting the Ca/B ratio and possibly the incidence
of brown-heart. It should be pointed out that use of the Ca/B ratio in assessing the boron status of
plants should be viewed in relation to the suﬃciency of other nutrients in the growing medium and
in the plant.

8.7.1.2 Macronutrients, Sulfur, and Zinc
Among the macronutrients, nitrogen is of utmost importance in aﬀecting boron accumulation by
plants. Chapman and Vanselow (191) were among the pioneers in establishing that liberal nitrogen
applications are sometimes beneﬁcial in controlling excess boron in citrus. Under conditions of high

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 262

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

boron, application of nitrogen depresses the level of boron in orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) leaves
(192). Lysimeter experiments showed that tripled fertilization (NPK) rates and irrigation increased
boron accumulation by plants on tested soils (193).

Boron  concentrations  in  boot-stage  tissue  of  barley  and  wheat  increased  signiﬁcantly  with
increasing rates of compost additions (59). Such increases in boron were attributed to a high con-
centration of 14 mg B kg⫺1 in the compost. The authors reported that boron concentrations decreased
with  increasing  rates  of  nitrogen. Additions  of  nitrogen  decreased  the  severity  of  boron  toxicity
symptoms. The form of nitrogen can aﬀect plant boron accumulation. Wojcik (194) reported that on
boron-deﬁcient, coarse-textured  soils, nitrogen  as  calcium  and  ammonium  nitrates  increased  the
availability and uptake of boron by roots. This increase was attributed to the fact that nitrate inhib-
ited boron sorption on iron and aluminum oxides, and increased boron in soil solution.

Increasing rates of nitrogen applied to initially nitrogen-deﬁcient soils signiﬁcantly decreased
the boron concentration of boot-stage tissue in barley and wheat in a greenhouse study, but ﬁeld
experiments  did  not  show  any  signiﬁcant  eﬀect  of  nitrogen  on  boron  concentration  (195).  The
ineﬀectiveness of nitrogen in alleviating boron toxicity in cereals under ﬁeld conditions is due to
the fact that nitrogen failed to decrease the boron concentration in boot-stage tissue. Furthermore,
nitrogen deﬁciency was more severe under greenhouse conditions than under ﬁeld conditions. The
decreases in boron concentrations were greater with the ﬁrst level of added nitrogen than with the
higher  rates  (195). This  result  may  indicate  that  application  of  nitrogen  is  helpful  in  alleviating
boron toxicity on soils low in available nitrogen.

Little  diﬀerence  in  boron  concentration  of  alfalfa  was  detected, and  symptoms  of  boron
deﬁciency  progressed  with  increasing  potassium  concentration  in  the  growth  media  (196).  The
authors  suggested  that  the  accentuating  eﬀect  of  high  potassium  on  boron  toxicity  or  deﬁciency
symptoms might be due to the inﬂuence of potassium on cell permeability, which is presumably
regulated by boron. Long-term experiments on cotton indicated positive yield responses to boron
fertilization  when  associated  with  potassium  applications  (197). Yield  increases  were  related  to
increased leaf potassium and boron concentrations.

The eﬀects of phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur are less clear than those of nitrogen on the avail-
ability of boron to plants. Studies conducted in China (198) showed that rape (Brassica napus L.) plant
boron concentration decreased with increasing potassium, and that lower potassium levels enhanced
boron  accumulation.  The  authors  concluded  that  the  optimum  K/B  ratio  in  rape  plants 
was 1000:1.

Tanaka  (199)  showed  that  boron  accumulation  in  radish  increased  with  an  increase  in  phos-
phorus supply. Malewar et al. (200) found that increasing the phosphorus fertilization rate resulted
in higher phosphorus in cotton and groundnut. Experiments conducted on cotton also demonstrated
that boron concentration in leaves was greatest with phosphorus fertilization (201). On the other
hand, the presence of phosphorus can aﬀect boron toxicity in calcareous soils. In studies on maize
genotypes, boron was more toxic in the absence, rather than in the presence of, phosphorus, and
thus boron toxicity in calcareous soils of the semiarid regions could be alleviated with applications
of phosphorus (202).

Sulfate may have a slight eﬀect on accumulation of boron in plant tissues (199). Field studies
in  Maharashtra, India, showed  that  boron  applied  with  gypsum  gave  increased  dry  pod  yield  of
groundnuts (203). The experimental results from a number of crops indicated that sulfur applica-
tions had no eﬀect on boron concentration of peas, cauliﬂower, timothy (Phleum pratense L.), red
clover, and  wheat, but  such  applications  signiﬁcantly  decreased  the  boron  content  of  alfalfa  and
rutabaga (83). It is possible that various crops behave diﬀerently. For example, with soybean, appli-
cations of gypsum at 1000 kg ha⫺1 did not alleviate boron toxicity resulting from the application of
10 kg B ha⫺1 (204).

Recent  studies  showed  that  applied  zinc  played  a  role  in  partially  alleviating  boron  toxicity
symptoms by decreasing the plant boron accumulation (205). Zinc treatments partially depressed
the inhibitory eﬀect of boron on tomato growth (150).

8.7.1.3 Soil Texture
The texture of soil is an important factor aﬀecting the availability of boron (206). A study on soils
from eastern Canada showed that higher quantities of hot-water-soluble boron occurred in  ﬁne-
textured soils than in coarse-textured soils (207). Studies in Poland showed that boron accumula-
tion  in  potatoes  and  several  cereals  was  less  on  sandy  soils  than  on  loamy  soils  (193).Page  and
Cooper (208) reported that leaching losses from acid, sandy soils after addition of 12.5 cm of water,
account for as much as 85% of the applied boron. Movement is less rapid in heavy-textured soils
because of increased ﬁxation by the clay particles (119).

In  Brazil, response  to  boron  by  cotton  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  on Alic  Cambisol, and  the
reverse was true for a dystrophic dark red latosol (209). It was suggested that high sand content
(87%) and low clay (10%) and low organic matter (1.3%) in the latter soil could have resulted in
toxic  concentrations  of  boron  in  solution.  The  type  of  clay  and  the  soil  pH  can  signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence the amount of boron adsorbed. Hingston (210) reported that increasing pH resulted in an
increase in the monolayer adsorption and a decrease in bonding energy for Kent sand kaolinite and
Marchagee  montmorillonite, and  a  slight  increase  in  bonding  energy  for Willalooka  illite  up  to 
pH 8.5. On a mass basis, illite adsorbed most boron over the range of pH values commonly occur-
ring in soils; montmorillonite adsorbed appreciable amounts at higher pH, and kaolinite adsorbed
the least.

Fine-textured  soils  generally  require  more  boron  than  do  the  coarse-textured  soils  to  pro-
duce similar boron concentrations in plants. Boron concentrations in solutions of 3.5 mg kg⫺1 in
sandy loam and 4.5 mg kg⫺1 in clay loam resulted in similar boron concentrations in gram (Cicer
arietinum L.) (211).

8.7.1.4 Soil Organic Matter

Organic matter is one of the chief sources of boron in acid soils, as relatively little boron adsorption
on the mineral fraction occurs at low pH levels (212). The hot-water-soluble boron in soil has been
positively related to the organic matter content of the soil (207). Addition of materials such as com-
post rich in organic matter resulted in large concentrations of boron in plant tissues and in phytotox-
icity  (60).  Boron  in  organic  matter  is  released  in  available  form  largely  through  the  action  of
microbes (213). The complex formation of boron with dihydroxy compounds in soil organic matter
is considered to be an important mechanism for boron retention (214). The inﬂuence of organic mat-
ter on the availability of boron in soils is ampliﬁed by increases in pH and clay content of the soil.

8.7.1.5 Soil Adsorption

When boron is released from soil minerals, mineralized from organic matter, or added to soils by
means of irrigation or fertilization, part of the boron remains in solution, and part is adsorbed (ﬁxed)
by  soil  particles. An  equilibrium  exists  between  the  solution  and  adsorbed  boron  (215).  Usually
more boron is adsorbed by soils than is present in solution at any one time (216), and ﬁxation seems
to increase with time (207).

Boron retention in soil depends upon many factors such as the boron concentration of the soil,
soil pH, texture, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable ion composition, and the
type of clay and mineral coatings on clays (210,215,217,218). Of the clays, illite is the most reac-
tive with boron, and kaolinite is the least reactive on a mass basis (210,219).

8.7.1.6 Soil Salinity

An antagonistic relationship existed between soil boron application levels and sodium adsorption
ratio  (SAR)  of  irrigation  waters  (220). Visible  eﬀects  of  boron  toxicity  developed  in  sugar  beet
plants  at  0.5  SAR  at  high  boron  levels, and  the  symptoms  intensiﬁed  with  plant  age.  However,

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 264

264

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

eﬀects of excess boron were markedly reduced at 20 and 40 SAR. Increasing soil salinity levels
decreased the boron concentration in chickpea (gram) plants; such eﬀects were accentuated at the
higher boron levels (221).

8.7.2 OTHER FACTORS

8.7.2.1 Plant Genotypes
Data  on  the  eﬀect  of  plant  genotypes  on  boron  uptake  are  meager.  Susceptibility  to  boron
deﬁciency is controlled by a single recessive gene (222), as shown by the tomato cultivars T 3238 
(B-ineﬃcient) and Rutgers (B-eﬃcient). Studies (222,223) have shown that T 3238 lacks the abil-
ity to transport boron to the top of the plants and conﬁrms the diﬀerential response of T 3238 and
Rutgers  to  a  given  supply  of  boron.  Gorsline  et  al.  (106)  observed  that  corn  hybrids  exhibited
genetic variability related to boron uptake and leaf concentration. One study conducted by E.G.
Beauchamp, L.W. Kannenberg, and R.B. Hunter at the University of Guelph, Ontario (personal
communication), indicated that the corn inbred CG 10, compared with several others, was the least
eﬃcient in boron accumulation as measured by the boron content of leaves sampled at the anthe-
sis stage. These researchers, in a study of 11 hybrids, also found that decreased boron accumula-
tion was associated with higher stover yield.

Some wheat cultivars in Asia, were tolerant of boron deﬁciency, whereas several sensitive geno-
types failed to set grain in the absence of boron (224). Experiments conducted in China showed that
roots of some wheat varieties secreted more organic acids, resulting in low pH and increased avail-
ability of boron, zinc, and phosphorus (225).

8.7.2.2 Environmental Factors
One of the chief environmental factors aﬀecting the response of plants to the availability of nutri-
ents is the intensity of light. The faster the plant grows, for example, under high light conditions,
the faster it will develop boron deﬁciency symptoms in a particular growth period. Observations by
Broyer (226) indicated that deﬁciencies as well as toxicities are revealed earliest or most intensely
in the summer. Experiments conducted with duckweed (Lemna paucicostata Hegelm.) showed that
reducing light intensity decreased the response to boron deﬁciency or toxicity (227). In the absence
of boron, severe deﬁciencies were observed in cultures under continuous illumination from a day-
light ﬂuorescent lamp at 5500 lux, but not at 1000 lux. Over the range of 0.5 to 2.5 mg B L⫺1 in the
culture solution, plant boron accumulation was reduced with decreasing light intensity. Studies con-
ducted  on  young  tomato  plants  grown  in  solution  culture  showed  that  in  the  absence  of  boron
deﬁciency, symptoms developed more rapidly at high than at low light intensity (228). Plants sup-
plied with boron did not exhibit symptoms.

An interaction appears to occur between temperature and lighting conditions. Rawson et al. (229)
reported that low light alone reduced ﬂoret fertility in wheat by around 8%; however, in combina-
tion with a marginal boron supply, low light ampliﬁed the boron deﬁciency eﬀect by some 60%.
Furthermore, reduced  light  had  the  most  deleterious  eﬀect  at  high  temperature.  Field  studies  in
Bangladesh (230) demonstrated that some of the factors responsible for sterility in wheat are low
temperatures  over  many  days  during  ﬂowering, and  saturated  or  waterlogged  soil. These  factors
aﬀect transpiration, which in turn aﬀects boron transport in the plant during the critical preﬂowering
or ﬂowering period.

Soil water appears to aﬀect the availability of boron more than that of some other elements.
Studies by Kluge (231) indicated that boron deﬁciency in plants during drought may be only par-
tially associated with the level of hot-water-soluble boron in soil. Reduced soil solution in connec-
tion with reduced mass ﬂow and reduced diﬀusion rate, as well as limited transpiration ﬂow in the
plants during drought periods, may be causative factors of boron deﬁciency in spite of an adequate
supply  of  available  boron  in  the  soil.  Boron  deﬁciencies  are  generally  found  in  dry  soils  where 

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 265

Boron

265

summer or winter drought is severe; when adequate moisture is maintained throughout the summer,
deﬁciency  symptoms  may  not  be  common  (232).  In  an  experiment  on  barley, soil  water  had  a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on plant boron accumulation after boron was applied to the soil (195). The boron
concentration of barley, with added boron, ranged from 162 to 312 mg kg⫺1 under normal condi-
tions, but only from 87 to 135 mg kg⫺1 when the area near the boron fertilizer band was kept dry.
Mortvedt and Osborn (233) likewise reported that movement of boron from the fertilizer granules
increased with concentration gradient and soil moisture content.

Boron concentration of some plants has been found to be a direct function of air temperature
over the 8 to 37⬚C range. For example, Forno et al. (234) found that Cassava (Manihot esculentum
Crantz) roots grew well when the solution temperature was maintained at 28 or 33⬚C, but developed
severe boron deﬁciency symptoms at 18⬚C. Mild symptoms of boron deﬁciency were also obtained
at a solution temperature of 23⬚C.

Relative humidity also aﬀects boron accumulation, for example, an increase in percent relative
humidity  from  30  to  95  resulted  in  a  decrease  from  16.5  to  9.9 mg  B  per  plant  (235).  Boron
deﬁciency symptoms observed in birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) were caused by a tempo-
rary deﬁciency of available boron, induced by local drought conditions (236).

Generally, soils  that  have  developed  in  humid  regions  have  low  amounts  of  plant-available
boron because of leaching. Further, plant-available boron that is present in such soils is located in
the top 15 cm and in the organic matter fraction (237,238). Thus, plants growing in regosols, sandy
podzols, alluvial  soils, organic  soils, and  low  humic  gleys  tend  to  develop  boron  deﬁciencies
because of low soil boron reserves.

At low temperatures in spring and fall in temperate regions, availability of boron is low, as evi-
dent in crops such as alfalfa and red clover. It has been suggested that during the cool season, plants
may  have  an  increased  demand  for  B  at  a  time  when  microbial  activity  in  the  soil  is  depressed
(David Pilbeam, Personal communication, University of Leeds, England). The lower rate of root
growth during the cool season may cause the rhizosphere to become depleted of boron, and falling
temperatures may make cell membranes less ﬂuid.

Sterility has become one of the most important wheat production constraints in Nepal (239).
Among environmental factors, cold temperatures during the reproductive stages at higher altitudes
coupled with low availability of boron are major factors causing sterility in wheat (239). Pot exper-
iments  conducted  on  spring  wheat  also  showed  that  cold  temperatures  signiﬁcantly  reduced  the
response of plants to boron, and if a cold-susceptible cultivar was cold-stressed, it accumulated less
boron (240).

8.7.2.3 Method of Cultivation and Cropping
The method of ploughing has been shown to aﬀect plant boron accumulation. For example, Lal
et al.  (241)  reported  that  boron  concentration  in  corn  leaf  tissue  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  with
mouldboard plough and ridge till than with no-till and beds. Cropping systems inﬂuence the avail-
ability of boron in soil. In a continuous cropping study in China, available boron in soil was higher
after three crops of soybeans than after three crops of wheat (242).

8.7.2.4 Irrigation Water

Gupta et al. (243) reported that only a few irrigation waters have enough boron to injure plants
directly. The continued use of irrigation and concentration of boron in the soil due to evapotran-
spiration are the reasons for the eventual toxicity problems. In arid and semiarid regions, boron
concentrations of irrigation waters, especially underground waters, are often elevated and in some
cases may be as high as 5 mg L⫺1 (244). The majority of surface waters have boron concentrations
of 0.1 to 0.3 mg L⫺1, but well waters are more variable in boron content and often have excessive
amounts  (215).  Some  river  waters  used  for  irrigation  may  show  high  levels  of  boron  at  certain

CRC_DK2972_Ch008.qxd  7/14/2006  4:03 PM  Page 266

266

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

times of the year due to the contribution of spring drainage areas high in boron. Generally, ground
waters  emanating  from  light-textured  soils  are  higher  in  boron  than  those  from  heavy-textured
soils (245).

Boron movement in plants has been associated with transpiration. Therefore, any component of
the environment that changes transpiration ﬂux can aﬀect boron availability. It has been proposed
that decreased boron availability leading to sterility in wheat is due to water deﬁcit as well as water-
logging in the root zone (246).

8.8 FERTILIZERS FOR BORON
Modern  crop  production  depends  on  addition  of  fertilizers  to  supplement  natural  soil  fertility.
Historically, crop production management has progressed to more intensive methods. Precise nutri-
ent management has become essential for sustainable agricultural production systems. Addition of
all plant nutrients must be considered for optimum crop production. With intensiﬁcation of crop
production, the need for micronutrient fertilization increases. Boron deﬁciency has been recognized
as one of the most common micronutrient problems in agriculture.

8.8.1 TYPES OF FERTILIZERS
Boron deposits of major economic importance are found only in arid regions of the world where
volcanic  action  brought  B  and  other  volatile  elements  to  the  surface  of  the  Earth  during  the
Cenozoic era (56). Boron combined with alkali or alkaline earth elements to form rich deposits con-
sisting chieﬂy of hydrous borates of calcium and sodium. The high water solubility of surface borate
deposits precludes their existence in humid regions (56).

Concentrated borate deposits of commercial value were formed in continental enclosed basins
by the evaporation of waters, which were boron-enriched by volcanic emanations. The locations of
the major deposits are primarily in or near zones with histories of volcanic activity in arid regions.
For example, a huge borate deposit, the Kramer deposit, was formed in a continental (nonmarine)
basin in the Mojave Desert of California, associated with thermal spring activity during the Miocene
epoch of the Cenozoic era. Similarly, signiﬁcant boron deposits were formed in Argentina along the
Andean mountain range near Salta. Studies have shown similarities between the hydrous borates of
magnesium, calcium, and  sodium  formed  in  the  Tincalayu  deposit  in  the  Province  of  Salta,
Argentina, those in Kirka, Turkey, and the Kramer deposit in California (247).

Before the nineteenth century, Tibet was the world’s source of borates. During the nineteenth
century, commercially  viable  deposits  were  discovered  in  Italy, Turkey, South America, and  the
United States. The largest known borate deposits occur in the interior plateau of Turkey. The sec-
ond largest occur in the Mojave Desert. Other countries having substantial borate deposits are the
former Soviet Union, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, and China (248). Borax and solubor
are the two most common boron fertilizers. Borax (Na2B4O7.10H2O) has been an important com-
mercial mineral for centuries. A list of common fertilizers is shown in Table 8.5.

8.8.2 METHODS AND RATES OF APPLICATION
The  boron  requirement  of  crops  varies  considerably, so  recommendations  must  take  these
diﬀerences into account. Although plant species having high boron requirements are more likely to
become boron deﬁcient under boron-limiting conditions in the soil, their recommended boron rates
may vary according to other conditions such as diﬀerences in root systems, eﬀects of other soil
parameters, and available soil calcium. Therefore, generalized boron recommendations must take
all such factors into account.

Application of boron fertilizers at the recommended rate for a high-boron-requiring crop may
provide excessive available boron for another crop. Tolerance to higher levels of available boron

varies considerably, and species with high boron requirements do not necessarily have high toler-
ance and vice versa. For example, alfalfa and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) have high
boron requirements but are only semitolerant to high boron levels (249).

Recommended rates of boron application generally range from 0.25 to 3 kg ha⫺1, depending on
crop  requirements  and  methods  of  application.  Higher  rates  of  boron  generally  are  required  for
broadcast soil applications than for banded soil application or foliar sprays. Rates are usually sim-
ilar for all boron sources, except for higher rates with slowly soluble sources such as colemanite or
fritted products. Recommended boron rates and methods of application for some commonly fertil-
ized crops are summarized by Mortvedt and Woodruﬀ (116).

A primary consideration for soil application of boron is the soil surface texture and depth. In
coarse-textured  soils, under  high  rainfall, boron  may  move  rapidly  downward  and  from  the  root
zone (250). In a loamy sand with the argillic horizon more than 40 cm deep, boron side-dressed is
more eﬀective than broadcast applications for corn (251). Fine-textured soils have the capacity to
restrict boron leaching from the upper layers. Tap-rooted crops such as soybeans, may absorb nutri-
ents from deeper layers, especially in dry weather, and beneﬁt from boron in subsurface layers.

The two chief methods of boron fertilization are by adding it directly to the soil or by foliar
spraying. Generally, soil and foliar applications of B are eﬀective for crops. Soil applications are gen-
erally used for applying boron to ﬁeld crops, but foliar sprays are more common on perennial crops
such as fruit trees. Foliar application rates are usually about 50% lower than soil application rates.
However, Murphy and Lancaster (252) obtained maximum yields of cotton with either 0.5 kg B ha⫺1
applied as a foliar spray (ﬁve times at 0.1 kg ha⫺1 each) or with ⬎0.3 kg B ha⫺1 applied to the soil.
For soybeans in a silt loam, foliar boron sprays were eﬀective in increasing the number of pods per
branch, but soil-applied boron had no eﬀect (253).

Either broadcast or banded applications to soil are recommended, depending on the crop and
soil conditions. Broadcast applications are used to establish and maintain alfalfa and other nonrow
crops.  Banded  applications  may  result  in  greater  eﬃciency  of  applied  boron.  Root  growth  may 
be  depressed  in  soil  near  banded  boron  fertilizers.  Mortvedt  and  Osborn  (233)  reported  soluble
boron  concentrations  as  high  as  75 mg  kg⫺1 in  soil  near  banded  NP  fertilizers  with  1%  B  as
Na2B4O7.5H2O. Root growth of alfalfa and oats was depressed in soil containing soluble boron con-
centrations ⬎10 mg kg⫺1. Soluble boron concentrations in soil would be much lower if the same
boron rate was broadcast rather than banded to soil.

Applications  of  boron  to  the  soil  alone  or  with  mixed  fertilizers  are  common, and  most  data
reported on plant boron accumulation have been obtained with boron-containing fertilizers applied

broadcast or in bands. In  ﬁeld studies on rutabaga, band applications of boron resulted in greater
boron concentrations in leaf tissue than did broadcast applications (254). In fact, boron applications
of  1.12 kg  ha⫺1 applied  in  bands  resulted  in  greater  boron  concentrations  in  leaf  tissue  than  did
2.24 kg  ha⫺1 applied  broadcast.  Studies  on  rutabagas  (254)  and  on  corn  (108,255)  indicated  that
band- or foliar-applied boron resulted in greater boron accumulation by plants than did boron applied
broadcast. Greater boron accumulation when it is applied in bands is likely due to the fact that a large
quantity of the available nutrient is concentrated in the immediate root zone. Thus, boron applied in
bands would be concentrated over a small area and would be taken up by the plants rapidly.

Applications of nutrients by foliar spray are eﬀective in areas of California and Arizona where
soil applications of micronutrients are ineﬀective because elements such as zinc, manganese, and
copper are ﬁxed in forms that are not readily available to certain crops (256). Foliar applications,
besides resulting in higher boron accumulation in plants, could be used to advantage if a farmer
omitted the addition of boron in the NPK bulk fertilizer or if boron deﬁciency was suspected. Foliar
spray applications in the early growth stages resulted in greater absorption of boron than did those
applied at later stages of growth (254). Mortvedt (257) stated that early-morning applications of
foliar-applied nutrients may result in increased absorption, as the relative humidity is high and the
stomata are open. It should however be pointed out that more than 98% of the boron applied as a
foliar spray on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) remained at the point of application, and less than
2% was useful to the growth of the plant (258). This small but eﬃcient portion of boron was quite
mobile and was distributed to the diﬀerent parts of the plants and then transferred from the oldest
parts to the newly formed leaves. In a study on barley, soil applications of boron produced higher
boron concentrations in the boot-stage tissue and grain, than similar amounts of boron applied as
foliar  spray  (259).  This  result  indicates  that  boron  uptake, at  least  by  barley, is  more  eﬃcient
through soil–root systems than through the leaves.

For some elements such as molybdenum, which plants require in extremely small amounts, seed
treatment with a preparation containing molybdenum will prevent a deﬁciency. However, because
of the comparatively higher requirement of boron than molybdenum, and because of the toxic eﬀect
of boron on seeds or seedlings, seed treatment for boron fertilization has not received attention.

9.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION
Chlorine is classiﬁed as a micronutrient, but it is often taken up by plants at levels comparable to a
macronutrient.  Supplies  of  chlorine  in  nature  are  often  plentiful, and  obvious  symptoms  of
deﬁciency are seldom observed. In many crops it is necessary to remove chlorine from air, chemi-
cals, and water to induce symptoms of chlorine deﬁciency. Using precautions to establish a rela-
tively  chlorine-free  environment, Broyer  et  al.  (1)  was  able  to  convincingly  demonstrate  that
chlorine is an essential nutrient. Although crop responses to chlorine applications in the ﬁeld were
suspected as early as the mid-1800s, it was not until fairly recently that chlorine was considered a
potentially limiting nutrient for crop production under ﬁeld conditions. In the 1980s, the respon-
siveness of some crops to chlorine fertilization became recognized more widely (2). Even though
chlorine has gained the attention of agronomists, much of the focus on chlorine in terms of crop
production continues to be over the presence of excess levels of chloride salts in soils, water, and
fertilizers (3,4). This chapter, however, is concerned primarily with chlorine as a plant nutrient.

9.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Early observations of plant growth responses derived from the use of chlorine-containing fertilizers
had suggested that chlorine was at least beneﬁcial if not essential (5). Demonstrating the essentiality
of chlorine is experimentally challenging because chlorine is present widely in the environment, and
special  precautions  are  necessary  to  remove  chlorine  from  chemicals, water, and  air  to  induce
deﬁciency symptoms in most species (6). Solution culture experiments conducted in a relatively chlo-
rine-free  environment  (1)  provided  the  ﬁrst  recognition  of  chlorine  as  an  essential  microelement.
These experiments further showed that chlorine deﬁciency symptoms were alleviated speciﬁcally by
the  addition  of  chloride.  Using  solution  culture  (7), acute  chlorine  deﬁciency  or  at  least  restricted
growth was demonstrated in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.), cab-
bage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), bar-
ley (Hordeum vulgare L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench),
corn (Zea mays L.), and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Under the same conditions however, squash
(Praecitrullus ﬁstulosus Pang.) plants failed to exhibit any signs of chlorine deﬁciency. Species not
aﬀected or least aﬀected by low chlorine supply appear to accumulate more chlorine than provided by
the culture solutions. It has been assumed that chlorine was absorbed from the atmosphere and that
plants diﬀered in this ability (6,7). More recently, low-chlorine solution studies have produced chlo-
rine deﬁciency symptoms in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
(8–10). Thus, the essentiality of chlorine has been established by the observations of the deﬁciency in
a wide range of species.

9.1.2 FUNCTIONS IN PLANTS
Chlorine  is  readily  taken  up  by  plants  in  the  electrically  charged  form  as  chloride  ion  (Cl⫺).
Although chlorine occurs in plants as chlorinated organic compounds (11), chloride is the major
form within plants, where it is bound only loosely to exchange sites or is a highly mobile free anion
in the plant water. As an essential element, chlorine has several biochemical and physiological func-
tions within plants.

Chloride appears to be required for optimal enzyme activity of asparagine synthethase (12), amy-
lase (13), and ATPase (14). In photosynthesis, chloride is an essential cofactor for the activation of the
oxygen-evolving  enzyme  associated  with  photosystem  II  (15,16).  Chloride  may  bind  (17)  to  the
polypeptides associated with the water-splitting complex of photosystem II, and it may stabilize the oxi-
dized state of manganese by acting as a bridging ligand (18–20). Chloride concentrations required for
biochemical functions are relatively low in comparison to concentrations required for osmoregulation.
In rapidly expanding tissues such as elongating cells of roots and shoots, chloride accumulates
in the tonoplast, to function as an osmotically active solute (21,22). This transport of chloride into
the tonoplast occurs in association with the proton-pumping ATPase activity at the tonoplast, being
speciﬁcally stimulated by chloride (14). This osmoregulatory function in speciﬁc tissues requires
concentrations of chloride that are not typical of a micronutrient (23,24). The accumulation of chlo-
ride in plant cells increases tissue hydration (25) and turgor pressure (26). This osmotic function of
chloride works closely with potassium to facilitate cell elongation and growth. The importance of
this  osmoregulatory  role  of  chloride  in  plants  depends  on  growing  conditions  and  the  presence 
of alternative anions, such as nitrate, which might function as substitutes for chloride.

Chloride along with potassium participates in stomatal opening by moving from epidermal cells
to guard cells to act as an osmotic solute that results in water uptake into and a bowing apart of the
guard cell pair (27). In many plant species, depending on the external supply of chloride, malate
synthesis may occur in the guard cells and replace the need for chloride inﬂux (28,29). Chloride,
however, is essential for stomatal functioning in some plant species (30). In onion (Allium cepa L.),
for example, where the guard cells are unable to synthesize malate, there is a requirement for an
inﬂux of chloride that is equivalent to potassium for stomatal opening to occur.

Relative diﬀerences in the uptake of cations (NH4

⫹, Ca2⫹, Mg2⫹, K⫹, Na⫹) and anions (NO3
⫺,
⫺) by plants require the maintenance of electroneutrality in plant cells as well as

in the external soil solution (31). As an anion, chloride serves to balance charges from cations. In
plants well supplied with chloride, this inorganic anion may serve as an alternative to the formation
of malate in its charge-balancing role (32). This role of chloride may be of greater importance when
cation uptake exceeds anion uptake, as often occurs with plants provided with ammonium nutrition.
The  functions  of  most  of  the  over  130  chlorinated  organic  compounds  (11)  that  have  been
identiﬁed  in  higher  plants  have  not  been  determined.  Some  legume  species  contain  chlorinated
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in their seeds. The chlorinated form of IAA is more resistant to degra-
dation, and this resistance may be responsible for increasing the rate of hypocotyl elongation over
the rate of IAA production itself (4,33).

9.2 DIAGNOSIS OF CHLORINE STATUS IN PLANTS

9.2.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY
Visible deﬁciency symptoms for chlorine have been well characterized in several crops by growth
of plants in chlorine-free nutrient solutions (1,7,8,10). The most commonly described symptom of
chlorine deﬁciency is wilting of leaves, especially at the margins. As the deﬁciency becomes more
severe, the leaves may exhibit curling, shriveling, and necrosis (Figure 9.1A). Roots of chlorine-
deﬁcient plants have been described as stubby with club tips. Deﬁciency symptoms of chlorine are
not commonly exhibited visually in most crops growing in the ﬁeld, but symptoms are sometimes
observed in wheat and coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.). In chlorine-deﬁcient wheat, the symp-
toms are expressed as chlorotic or necrotic lesions on leaf tissue (Figure 9.1B). These symptoms
that result from chlorine deﬁciency have been named ‘Cl-deﬁcient leaf spot syndrome’ (9,10). It
has also been shown that bromide (Figure 9.1C) does not substitute for chloride in the prevention
of deﬁciency symptoms (10). In coconut palm, the symptoms are exhibited as wilting and prema-
ture senescence of leaves, frond fracture, and stem cracking and bleeding (34).

Chlorine deﬁciency is also indicated by yield increases that may occur with various crops in
response  to  chloride  fertilization.  Wheat  and  barley  often  respond  to  chloride  fertilization  with
increases in grain yield on soils with low chloride on the Great Plains of North America (2,35–41).
Corn exhibited no response to chloride fertilization in some studies (2,42–44), but in a high-yield
environment in New Jersey, fertilization of corn with 400 kg Cl ha⫺1 increased the 5-year average

yield by 1000 kg ha⫺1 over the unfertilized control (45,46). Positive responses from chloride fertil-
ization have also been observed with rice (Oryza sativa L.), sugarcane (Saccharum edule Hassk.),
potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa A. Chev.), coconut palm, sugar beet,
and asparagus (Asparagus oﬃcinalis L.) (2,47). These responses indicate that chloride is sometimes
a yield-limiting nutrient in ﬁeld environments where chlorine inputs from rainfall and other natural
sources are inadequate.

The beneﬁcial eﬀects of chloride fertilization are sometimes not the result of a plant response
directly to enhanced chloride nutrition, but rather may result from suppression of plant diseases.
Addition of chloride has been reported to reduce the severity of at least 15 diﬀerent foliar and root
diseases on 11 diﬀerent crops (Table 9.1). Several possible mechanisms may explain the eﬀects of
chloride nutrition on disease suppression and host resistance.

In acid soils, chloride inhibits nitriﬁcation (48,49). Keeping nitrogen in the ammonium form
can lower rhizosphere pH and inﬂuence microbial populations and nutrient availability in the rhi-
zosphere (31,50). Competition between chloride and nitrate for uptake also tends to reduce nitrate
concentrations in plant tissues (4,51). When plants take up more ammonium and less nitrate, it
usually causes rhizosphere acidiﬁcation, which in turn, may enhance manganese availability (52).
Chloride  can  also  enhance  manganese  availability  by  promoting  manganese-reducing  microor-
ganisms  in  soil  (53).  Factors  which  increase  manganese  availability  have  been  associated  with
improved host resistance to diseases such as take-all on grain crops (54). Higher concentrations
of  chloride  in  plant  tissues  can  also  enhance  water  retention  and  turgor  when  roots  have  been

attacked  by  pathogens  (26). The  amount  of  organic  acids, such  as  malate, in  plant  tissues  and
exuded from roots, decreases with chloride supply; this action deprives pathogens of an organic
substrate (55).

9.2.2 SYMPTOMS OF EXCESS
Chloride toxicity symptoms have been observed in many  ﬁeld, vegetable, and fruit crops (6,56).
Curling of the leaf margins, marginal leaf scorch, leaf necrosis, and leaf drop are typical symptoms.
Older leaves are usually the ﬁrst to exhibit symptoms that may progress upward, aﬀecting the entire
foliage.  Dieback  of  the  terminal  axis  and  small  branches  may  occur  in  cases  of  severe  toxicity.
These symptoms of chloride toxicity occur in the absence of sodium, but they are also similar to
symptoms of salt toxicity that occur when chloride is accompanied by sodium. Crops and cultivars
within crops vary widely in tolerance to high levels of chloride, with corn being relatively tolerant
to chloride (56) compared to soybean (Glycine max Merr.) (57).

9.2.3 CONCENTRATIONS OF CHLORINE IN PLANTS

9.2.3.1 Chlorine Constituents

Most of the chlorine in plants is present in the form of the anion, chloride. However, more than 130
natural  chlorine-containing  compounds  have  been  isolated  from  plants  (11).  They  may  include
polyacetylenes, thiophenes, iridoids, sesquiterpene lactones, pterosinoids, diterperenoids, steroids
and gibberellins, maytansinoids, alkaloids, chlorinated chlorophyll, chloroindoles and amino acids,
phenolics, and fatty acids. Although the functions of naturally occurring chlorine-containing com-
pounds in plants have not received much attention in plant nutrition, the fact that these compounds
often exhibit a strong biological activity suggests a need to investigate their potential importance.
Some chlorine-containing compounds may behave as hormones in the plant, or they may have a
function in protection against attack from other organisms.

9.2.3.2 Total Chlorine

The total chlorine accumulation by crops varies greatly, depending on chloride supply from soil.
Many  studies  (45,56,58–62)  of  plant  responses  to  applied  chloride  have  shown  that  plant  tissue
chloride concentrations increase markedly with increasing application rates of chloride. A few stud-
ies have measured total chlorine uptake by crops, and these studies also indicate that chloride accu-
mulation  by  crops  increases  with  increasing  amounts  of  chloride  fertilization.  A  study  (25)
conducted in North Carolina with corn fertilized with 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg Cl ha⫺1 in the
form of KCl found that the aboveground biomass at 77 days after emergence accumulated 26, 50,
63, 79, and 81 kg Cl ha⫺1, respectively. A Wisconsin study (62) found that alfalfa accumulated only
5 kg Cl ha⫺1 on unamended soil, but on soil fertilized with 1017 kg Cl ha⫺1 as KCl in the fall of the
previous season, the herbage accumulated 86 kg Cl ha⫺1. These accumulation values for chloride by
corn or alfalfa indicate that the potential for total crop accumulation for this nutrient is potentially
large on soils well supplied with chloride. Even though chlorine is classiﬁed as a micronutrient,
total chlorine accumulation often exceeds the levels of crop accumulation of macronutrients such
as phosphorus or sulfur.

The amount of chlorine accumulation required to prevent deﬁciency symptoms in most crops
however, is much less than that which is typically accumulated (Table 9.2). A laboratory study (7)
that determined the chlorine requirements of 11 diﬀerent crop species estimated that plants require
1 lb of chlorine for each 10,000 lb of dry matter produced, or a concentration of about 0.1 g kg⫺1.
On a land area basis, large crops may need about 2.24 kg ha⫺1 or more of chlorine. This estimate
for plant chlorine requirement is presumed to be for biochemical functions (2). The beneﬁts that are

sometimes observed from higher concentrations of chlorine are likely due to its osmoregulatory role
in plants (36).

9.2.3.3 Distribution in Plants

Most of the chlorine in plants is not incorporated into organic molecules or dry matter, but remains
in  solution  as  chloride  and  is  loosely  bound  to  organic  molecules.  Chloride  concentrations

expressed on a tissue-water basis may typically range from 50 to 150 mmol L⫺1 (4). A study (25)
that determined chloride in the tissue water and the dry matter of whole corn plants at 35 days after
emergence found a concentration of 66 mmol Cl L⫺1 (1.83 g kg⫺1 dry matter basis) for corn grown
on soil fertilized with 200 kg Cl ha⫺1 applied as KCl and only 10 mmol Cl L⫺1 (2.5 g kg⫺1 dry mat-
ter basis) for corn plants grown on unamended soil. In general, chloride concentrations are higher
in tissues that have high water content. Chloride concentrations are presumably highest in the rap-
idly expanding zones of root and shoot tissue. Pulvini and guard cells also have higher concentra-
tions of chloride than the bulk tissue (4).

Vegetative plant tissues usually accumulate increasing concentrations of chloride with increas-
ing supply of chloride, but plants parts can also exclude chloride (4,25,63). Corn seed may have
only 0.44 to 0.64 g Cl kg⫺1 on a dry weight basis, and chloride accumulation in the grain is not
inﬂuenced  by  chloride  supply  (45).  In  many  crops, chloride  transport  from  roots  to  shoots  is
restricted by a mechanism that resides in the roots (4,64,65). Soybean cultivars that exclude chlo-
ride from the shoots are more salt-tolerant than cultivars that accumulate chloride (57).

9.2.3.4 Critical Concentrations
Reports on critical tissue concentrations of chloride for crops grown in the ﬁeld are few in number
(Table 9.2). Studies conducted in the Great Plains of the United States have examined the relation-
ship  between  tissue  chloride  concentration  and  relative  yield  of  wheat.  In  wheat  plants  at  head
emergence, a critical chloride concentration of 1.5 g kg⫺1 was given in a 1986 report (66). In a more
recent and larger study (67) that was based on an assessment of 219 wheat cultivars, three zones of
chloride  status  were  identiﬁed: (i)  a  deﬁciency  zone  with  a  plant  chloride  concentration 
⬍1.0 g kg⫺1, (ii) an adequate chloride status zone with concentrations ⱖ4.0 g kg⫺1, (iii) and a tran-
sition, or critical range, between these two zones. A study (45) of corn grown in high-yield envi-
ronments in New Jersey suggested a critical ear-leaf chloride concentration of 3.2 g kg⫺1, derived
from a comparatively small database.

9.2.3.5 Chlorine Concentrations in Crops

A review (4) of chlorine nutrition tabulated the concentrations of chloride in a wide variety of crops.
The compilation of data in Table 9.2 shows that concentrations of chloride classiﬁed as deﬁcient,
normal, or toxic vary widely among plant species.

9.3 ASSESSMENT OF CHLORINE STATUS IN SOILS

9.3.1 FORMS OF CHLORINE
Chlorine is present in the soil solution primarily in the anionic form as chloride. Chloride concen-
trations in soil extracts may range from ⬍1 mg kg⫺1 to more than several thousand mg kg⫺1 (68).
Chlorine may also be present in organic forms such as chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide residues.
Some of these chlorine-containing molecules are recalcitrant, whereas others can be metabolized or
mineralized to release the chlorine.

Although plants can accumulate chlorine foliarly and from the atmosphere, the concentration
of chlorine in plant tissue is often closely related to the supply or concentration of chloride in soil.
Testing soils for chloride is routine in laboratories involved in salinity problems, but soil testing for
chloride  supply  to  predict  crop  response  to  fertilization  is  a  fairly  recent  development.  Soil  test
interpretations for chloride supply are currently conducted in the North American Great Plains and
are limited to only a few crops (2).

In this large land-locked geographical region, little potassium fertilizer (KCl) is applied, and
chloride input from rainfall is low. Soil test interpretations for chloride have not been developed

CRC_DK2972_Ch009.qxd  6/30/2006  4:12 PM  Page 286

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

outside this region because chloride inputs from various sources are often greater and because sup-
plies of this nutrient are generally considered adequate for most crops.

9.3.2 SOIL TESTS
The solubility and mobility of chloride in soil is similar to nitrate, and soil sampling depths for
chloride, like nitrate, are typically greater than for less mobile nutrients. Although the best soil
sampling depth may vary depending on the rooting depth of the crop, a sampling to a depth of
60 cm has been found to be a good indicator of chloride availability to potato (58) and to spring
wheat (2). Crops, such as sugar beet and winter wheat with deeper rooting depths, may need a
deeper sampling depth (2,37).

Because chloride is highly soluble and only weakly adsorbed, it can be extracted from soil with
water  or  any  dilute  electrolyte.  The  choice  of  extractant  may  depend  on  the  analytical  method
employed to determine the concentration of chloride in the extract. Methods of analysis for quanti-
fying extractable chloride may include colorimetric, potentiometric, or chromatographic procedures
(69). Precautions should be taken to avoid potential sources of chloride contamination (e.g., perspi-
ration, soil sample containers, dust, glassware, water) during soil sampling and laboratory analysis.

9.3.3 CHLORINE CONTENTS OF SOIL
In the Great Plains of the United States, soil tests are performed to assess the soil chloride level as
a  factor  to  be  considered  in  decisions  regarding  application  of  chloride  fertilizer.  The  relative
responsiveness of the various wheat and barley cultivars to chloride is also considered. Some culti-
vars  of  spring  wheat  and  barley  frequently  exhibit  responses  to  chloride, while  others  seldom
exhibit a response (41,66,70,71). Chloride response trials conducted at 36 locations found that a
critical level of 43 kg Cl ha⫺1 in the top 60 cm layer of soil would generally separate responsive sites
from nonresponsive sites (66,70). On the basis of this research, soils were classiﬁed as low (ⱕ34 kg
Cl ha⫺1), medium (35 to 67 kg Cl ha⫺1), or high (⬎67 kg Cl ha⫺1) in relation to the probability of
observing a response to chloride addition. Chloride fertilization is recommended according to this
equation: Cl⫺ to apply (kg ha⫺1) ⫽ 67 – Cl⫺ (kg Cl ha⫺1 to 60 cm sampling depth). This recom-
mendation is speciﬁc to wheat and barley crops grown in the region, and it should not be extrapo-
lated to other areas under diﬀerent climate, soil, and cultural conditions.

Soil test calibration data on chloride are unavailable for most crops and soils around the world.
However, an observation of chloride deﬁciency in Australia provides some insight into concentra-
tions of chloride in soil that may limit growth of some plants (72). In this instance, it was found that
subterranean  clover  (Trifolium  subterraneum L.)  exhibited  poor  growth  when  the  soil  contained
only 3 to 5 µeq of Cl per 100 g (1 to 2 mg kg⫺1).

When other factors limit crop yield potential, the potential for a response to chloride fertiliza-
tion is also limited. For example, corn grown in high-yield environments in New Jersey (18 miles
from the Atlantic Ocean) exhibited yield increases from chloride addition on soils that held 20 kg
Cl ha⫺1 in the top 60 cm layer of soil (45,46). In other studies with corn under less favorable con-
ditions, yield increases due to chloride fertilization were either small or nil (2,42–44).

In many instances, chloride is frequently supplied to crops as a consequence of the widespread
use  of  KCl-based  fertilizers  that  are  applied  with  the  intention  of  providing  potassium.
Recommended application rates of potassium, when applied as KCl, will generally supply suﬃcient
chloride to most crops. It is possible that the supply of chloride is sometimes limiting for crops
grown on a wider range of soils but that the crop responses to chloride go unrecognized because
they are attributed to potassium.

Chloride is widely distributed in soils. Concentrations normally range from 20 to 900 mg kg⫺1
with a mean concentration of 100 mg kg⫺1 (68). Because igneous rocks and parent materials in gen-
eral contain only minor amounts of chloride, little of this nutrient arises from weathering. Most of

CRC_DK2972_Ch009.qxd  6/30/2006  4:12 PM  Page 287

287

the  chloride  present  in  soils  arrive  from  rainfall, marine  aerosols, volcanic  emissions, irrigation
waters, and fertilizers (4).

Chloride is not adsorbed by minerals at pH levels above 7.0 and is only weakly absorbed in
kaolinitic and oxidic soils that have positive charges under acid conditions (68). Chloride accumu-
lates primarily in soil under arid conditions where leaching is minimal and where chloride moves
upward  in  the  soil  proﬁle  in  response  to  evapotranspiration.  Poorly  drained  soils  and  low  spots
receiving chloride from runoﬀ, seepage, or irrigation water also may accumulate chloride (57). Near
the ocean, soils have high levels of chloride, but with increasing distance from the ocean, chloride
concentration in soils typically falls (2,4).

How a crop is harvested inﬂuences the amount of chloride in soil. When harvested only as seed,
the amount of chloride removed is limited (⬍8 kg ha⫺1 for a corn yield of 11.3 Mg ha⫺1), but when
harvested as green biomass the amount of chloride removal may be substantial (81 kg ha⫺1 for corn
as silage) (25). Because chloride leaches from aging leaves, harvest of mature biomass may remove
only about half as much chloride as does harvest before the onset of senescence (59,61).

9.4 FERTILIZERS FOR CHLORINE

9.4.1 KINDS
Chlorine is added to soil from a wide variety of sources that include chloride from rainwater, irri-
gation waters, animal manures, plant residues, fertilizers, and some crop protection chemicals. The
amount of chloride deposited annually from the atmosphere varies from 18 to 36 kg⫺1 ha⫺1 year⫺1
for continental areas to more than 100 kg⫺1 ha⫺1 year⫺1 for coastal areas (4). Most of the chloride
applied  as  animal  manures  or  plant  residues  is  soluble  and  readily  available  for  crop  uptake.
Because most of the chloride in animal manure is probably present in the liquid fraction, manure
management and handling may inﬂuence the concentration of chloride.

Potassium  chloride  is  the  most  widely  applied  chloride  fertilizer.  Although  KCl  is  usually
intended as a potassium fertilizer, it in eﬀect supplies 0.9 kg of chloride for each kg of potassium.
Other chloride fertilizers include NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, and NH4Cl (Table 9.3). All these salts are
soluble and readily available to supply chloride for plant uptake. Organic agriculture, which dis-
courages the use of KCl and most salt-based fertilizers, obtains chloride primarily from manure and
other natural sources.

9.4.2 APPLICATION
Chloride, like nitrate, is susceptible to loss from soil by leaching in areas of high rainfall (62,73).
Management  practices  that  minimize  chloride  leaching  will  enhance  chloride  accumulation  by
crops. When crops with high chloride requirements are grown, the application of chloride in the

spring or close to the time of plant growth should enhance chloride accumulation. Owing to the
potential for salt injury, it is safer to broadcast chloride fertilizers than to apply them as a band.

10.1 THE ELEMENT COPPER

10.1.1 INTRODUCTION
Copper is one of the oldest known metals and is the 25th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust.
The words ‘aes Cyprium’ appeared in Roman writings describing copper, to denote that much of
the metal at the time came from Cyprus. Reﬁnement of copper metal dates back to 5000 BC. The
metal by itself is soft, but when mixed with zinc produces brass and when mixed with tin produces
bronze. Copper is malleable, ductile, and a good conductor of electricity. In its natural state, it is a
reddish solid with a bright metallic luster.

10.1.2 COPPER CHEMISTRY
Copper has an atomic number 29 and atomic mass of 63.55. It belongs to Group I-B transition met-
als. The melting point of copper is 1084.6°C. Copper occurs naturally in the cuprous (I, Cu⫹) and
cupric (II, Cu2⫹) valence states. There is a single electron in the outer 4s orbital. The 3d10 orbital
does not eﬀectively shield this outer electron from the positive nuclear charge, and therefore the 4s1
electron is difﬁcult to remove from the Cu atom (1). The ﬁrst ionization potential is 7.72 eV and the
second is 20.29 eV. Because the second ionization potential is much higher than the ﬁrst, a variety
of stable Cu⫹ species exist (2). The ionization state of copper depends on the physical environment,
the solvent, and the concentration of ligands present. In solution, copper is present as Cu2⫹ or com-
plexes of this ion. The cuprous ion Cu1⫹ is unstable in aqueous solutions at concentrations greater
than 10⫺7 M (3). However, in wet soils, Cu1⫹ is moderately stable at typically expected conditions
(10⫺6 to 10⫺7 M). Under such conditions, hydrated Cu1⫹ would be the dominant copper species (1).
Copper  can  exist  as  two  natural  isotopes, 63Cu  and  65Cu, with  relative  abundances  of  69.09  and
30.91%, respectively (4). In the Earth’s crust, copper is present as stable sulﬁdes in minerals rather
than silicates or oxides (3). The Cu1⫹ ion is present more commonly in minerals formed at consid-
erable depth, whereas Cu2⫹ is present close to the Earth’s surface (3).

The transition metals are noted for the variety of complexes they form with bases. In these com-
plexes, Cu1⫹ and Cu2⫹ act as electron acceptors. Chelating bases are so named because they have
two or more electron donor sites (often on O, S, or N atoms) that form a ‘claw’ around the copper
ion (1). Such complexes are important in soil chemistry and in plant nutrition. The Cu1⫹ ion forms
strong complexes with bases containing S, but Cu2⫹ does not. In the presence of these bases, Cu2⫹
acts as a strong oxidant (2).

10.2 COPPER IN PLANTS

10.2.1 INTRODUCTION
Copper was identiﬁed as a plant nutrient in the 1930s (5,6). Prior to this realization, one of the ﬁrst
uses of copper in agriculture was in chemical weed control (7). Despite its essentiality, copper is
toxic to plants at high concentrations (8). Uptake of copper by plants is aﬀected by many factors
including the soil pH, the prevailing chemical species, and the concentration of copper present in
the soil. Once inside the plant, copper is sparingly immobile. Accumulation and expression of toxic
symptoms are often observed with root tissues. Extensive use of copper-containing fungicides in
localized areas and contamination of soils adjacent to mining operations has created problems of
toxicity  in  some  agricultural  regions.  Because  of  this  problem, remediation  of  copper  and
identiﬁcation of tolerant plant species are receiving increased attention. Concentrations of copper
in some plant species under diﬀerent cultural conditions are reported in Table 10.1.

10.2.2 UPTAKE AND METABOLISM
The rate of copper uptake in plants is among the lowest of all the essential elements (9). Uptake of
copper by plant roots is an active process, aﬀected mainly by the copper species. Copper is most
readily available at or below pH 6.0 (4). Most sources report copper availability in soils to decrease
above  pH  7.0.  Increasing  soil  pH  will  cause  copper  to  bind  more  strongly  to  soil  components.
Copper bioavailability is increased under slightly acidic conditions due to the increase of Cu2⫹ ions
in the soil solution. On two soils in Spain, with similar pH values (8.0 and 8.1) but with diﬀerent
copper  levels  (0.64  and  1.92 mg  Cu  kg⫺1, respectively), leaf  content  of  willow  leaf  foxglove
(Digitalis obscura L.) was equal, i.e., 7 mg kg⫺1 dry weight on both soils (10). Copper concentra-
tions  of  tomato  (Lycopersicon  esculentum Mill.)  and  oilseed  rape  (canola, Brassica  napus L.)
roots and shoots were signiﬁcantly higher in an acidic soil (pH 4.3) than in a calcareous soil (pH
8.7) (11). In contrast, however, if a mixture of Cd (II), Cu (II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) was applied to

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

a  montmorillonite  [(Al,Mg)2(OH)2Si4O10]  soil  at  50 mg  kg⫺1 each, there  were  no  diﬀerences  in
growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) between soil pH treatments of 4.5, 5.8, and 7.1, and plants
grown at pH 7.1 accumulated the highest amount copper (12). However, if soil pH is above 7.5,
plants should be monitored for copper deﬁciency.

Copper has limited transport in plants; therefore, the highest concentrations are often in root tis-
sues (11,13,14,15). When corn (Zea mays L.) was grown in solution cultures at 10⫺5, 10⫺4, and 10⫺3 M
Cu2⫹, copper content of roots was 1.5, 8, and 10-fold greater respectively, than in treatments without
copper additions, with little copper translocation to shoot tissues occurring (14). On a Savannah ﬁne
sandy loam pasture soil in Mississippi containing 12.3 mg Cu kg⫺1, analysis of 16 diﬀerent forage
species revealed that root tissues accumulated the highest copper concentrations (28.8 mg kg⫺1), fol-
lowed by ﬂowers (18.1 mg kg⫺1), leaves (15.5 mg kg⫺1), and stems (8.4 mg kg⫺1) (16). Copper most
likely  enters  roots  in  dissociated  forms  but  is  present  in  root  tissues  as  a  complex.  Nielsen  (17)
⫽ 0.11 µmol L⫺1 and a
observed that copper uptake followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with a Km
⫽ 0.045 µmol  L⫺1 over  a  copper  concentration  range  of  0.08  to  3.59 µmol  L⫺1. Within
mean  Cmin
roots, copper is associated principally with cell walls due to its afﬁnity for carbonylic, carboxylic,
phenolic, and sulfydryl groups as well as by coordination bonds with N, O, and S atoms (18). At high
copper supply, signiﬁcant percentages of copper can be bound to the cell wall fractions. Within green
tissues, copper is bound in plastocyanin and protein fractions. As much as 50% or more of plant copper
localized  in  chloroplasts  is  bound  to  plastocyanin  (19).  The  highest  concentrations  of  shoot 
copper usually occur during phases of intense growth and high copper supply (9).

Accumulation  of  copper  can  be  inﬂuenced  by  many  competing  elements  (Table  10.2).  Copper
uptake in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in nutrient solution culture was aﬀected by free copper ion activ-
ity, pH of the solution, and concentration of Ca2⫹ (20). Copper concentration of four Canadian wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars was aﬀected by cultivar and applied nitrogen, but the variance due to
applied  nitrogen  was  fourfold  greater  than  that  due  to  cultivar  (21).  In  Chinese  cabbage  (Brassica
pekinensis Rupr.), iron and phosphorus deﬁciencies in nutrient solution stimulated copper uptake, but
abundant phosphorus supply decreased copper accumulation (22). Fertilizing a calcareous soil (pH 8.7,
144 µg Cu g⫺1) with an iron-deﬁcient solution increased copper accumulation by roots and shoots in
two wheat cultivars from 6 to 25 µg Cu g⫺1 (cv. Aroona) and 8 to 29 µg Cu g⫺1 (cv. Songlen) (13). In
this  same  study, zinc  deﬁciency  did  not  signiﬁcantly  stimulate  copper  accumulation  (13).  Iron
deﬁciency in nutrient solution culture increased copper and nitrogen leaf contents uniformly along corn
⫺2) depressed copper uptake, expressed as a per-
leaf blades (23). Selenite (SeO3
centage of total copper supplied, in pea (Pisum sativum L.), but not in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv.
Sunny). However, copper uptake and tissue concentration were not aﬀected by selenium (24).

⫺2) and selenate (SeO4

Iron and copper metabolism appear to be associated in plants and in yeast (25,26). Ferric-chelate
reductase is expressed on the root surface of plants and the plasma membrane of yeast under condi-
tions of iron deﬁciency (25). Lesuisse and Labbe (27) reported that ferric reductase reduces Cu2⫹ in
yeast  and  may  be  involved  in  copper  uptake.  Increases  in  manganese, magnesium, and  potassium
accumulation were associated with iron deﬁciency in pea, suggesting that plasma reductases may have
a regulatory function in root ion-uptake processes via their inﬂuence on the oxidation–reduction sta-
tus of the membrane (25,26). Evidence of this process was also supported by ﬁndings in a copper-sen-
sitive mutant (cup1-1) of mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh var. Columbia), suggesting
that defects in iron metabolism may inﬂuence copper accumulation in plants (25).

The copper requirements among diﬀerent plant species can vary greatly, and there can also be
signiﬁcant within-species variation of copper accumulation (28,29). The median copper concentration
of forage plants in the United States was reported to be 8 mg kg⫺1 for legumes (range 1 to 28 mg kg⫺1)
and 4 mg kg⫺1 for grasses (range 1 to 16 mg kg⫺1) (30). The copper content of native pasture plants in
central southern Norway ranged from 0.9 to 27.2 mg kg⫺1 (28). Copper concentrations of tomato leaves
from 105 greenhouses in Turkey ranged from 2.4 to 1490 mg kg⫺1 (31). Vegetables classiﬁed as hav-
ing a low response to copper applications are asparagus (Asparagus ofﬁcinalis L.), bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris L.), pea, and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Vegetables classiﬁed as having a high response

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Calcium (Ca)

Iron (Fe)

Zinc (Zn)

Interaction with Cu in Plant Tissuesa

Increasing levels of N fertilizers may increase requirement for Cu due to increased growth
N fertilization linearly increases the Cu content of shoots
High N levels may also inhibit translocation of Cu

Heavy use of P fertilizers can induce Cu deﬁciencies in citrus
Excess P in solution culture decreased Cu accumulation in Brassicab

Foliar K sprays have reduced the copper content of pecan

Ca was shown to reduce Cu uptake in nutrient solution culture in lettucec
Increasing Ca in solution culture improved reduced growth due to Cu toxicity
in mung beand

High levels of Fe have produced leaf chlorosis in citrus and lettuce
Fe deﬁciency has stimulated copper uptake in solution culture in Brassicay and corne
Excess Fe in nutrient solution culture lessened the eﬀects of Cu toxicity in spinachf

Cu signiﬁcantly inhibits the uptake of Zn
Zn will inhibit the uptake of Cu
Zn is believed to interfere with the Cu absorption process

Manganese (Mn)

Cu has been shown to stimulate uptake of Mn in several plant species

Molybdenum (Mo)

Cu interferes with the role of Mo in the enzymatic reduction of nitrate
A mutual antagonism has been found between Cu and Mo in several plant species

Aluminum (Al)

Al has been shown to adversely aﬀect the uptake of Cu

to  copper  are  beet  (Beta  vulgaris L.  Crassa  group), lettuce, onion  (Allium  cepa L.), and  spinach
(Spinacia oleracea L.) (32). In Australia, the critical copper concentration in young shoot tissue was
4.6 mg kg⫺1 for lentil (Lens culinaris Medik), 2.8 mg kg⫺1 for faba bean (Vicia faba L.), 2.6 mg kg⫺1
for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and 1.5 mg kg⫺1 for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (33). Leaves of
dwarf birch (Betula nana L.) had considerably lower copper levels than mountain birch (Betula pubes-
cens Ehrh.) and willow (Salix spp.) in central southern Norway (28).

The response of many crops to copper addition depends on their growth stages (20,34). In soy-
bean (Glycine max Merr.), the copper content of branch seeds was 20 µg g⫺1 whereas seeds from the
main stems contained 14 µg g⫺1 (35). Addition of 10 µg CuCl2
⭈2H2O g⫺1 to nutrient solution culture
signiﬁcantly suppressed leaf area in expanding cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) leaves, whereas cop-
per addition signiﬁcantly limited photosynthesis in mature leaves (34). However, the suppression in
photosynthesis was attributed to an altered source–sink relationship rather than the toxic eﬀect of
copper (34). Nitrogen and copper were the only elements that showed no gradation in concentration
along the entire corn leaf blade (23).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

The copper content of many edible plant parts is not correlated to the amount of soil copper
(15,36,29,37,38).  No  correlations  could  be  made  between  the  level  of  applied  copper  and  the
amount of that metal in edible parts of corn grain, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) roots, and alfalfa
leaves (29). Despite diﬀerences of mean soil copper levels ranging from 160 to 750 mg kg⫺1, cop-
per concentrations of edible tomato fruit and onion bulbs were similar (36). Although soil copper
levels ranged from 26 to 199 mg kg⫺1, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain accumulated only
between 2.12 and 6.84 mg Cu kg⫺1 (15). Comparing a control soil containing 18 mg Cu kg⫺1 and a
slag-contaminated soil containing 430 mg Cu kg⫺1, the respective copper concentrations for bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were 6.6 and 6.7 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight; for kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea
var. gongylodes L.) were 1.9 and 2.8 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight; for mangold (Beta vulgaris L. cv.
macrorhiza) were 11 and 18 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight; for lettuce were 11 and 40 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry
weight;  for  carrot  (Daucus  carota L.)  were  5.1  and  8.1 mg  Cu  kg⫺1 dry  weight;  and  for  celery
(Apium graveolens var. dulce Pers.) were 7.5 and 12 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight (38).

Proportionally less accumulation of cadmium, lead, and copper occurred in Artemisia species
in Manitoba, Canada, at high soil metal concentrations than in soils with low metal concentrations
(37). Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) accumulated only 5 µg Cu plant⫺1 when grown on an agricul-
tural soil (pH 6.3, 6.9% organic matter) contaminated with 591 mg Cu kg⫺1 (18). On the other hand,
increasing copper treatments from 0.3 µM CuSO4 to 10⫺5, 10⫺4, and 10⫺3 M Cu2⫹ increased root
copper  levels  in  sunﬂower  (Helianthus  annuus L.)  from  42, 108, 138, and  1070 µg  Cu  g⫺1 dry
weight, respectively, but not at the expense of growth (39). Contrary to results from many uptake
and accumulation studies, the above ground portions of H. annuus in this study accumulated more
copper than the roots (39).

Fertilizer  sources  of  copper  include  copper  chelate  (Na2CuEDTA  [13% Cu]), copper  sulfate
⭈5H2O  [25% Cu]), cupric  oxide  (CuO  [75% Cu]), and  cuprous  oxide  (Cu2O  [89% Cu]) 
(CuSO4
⭈5H2O and CuO (40) with
(Table 10.3). The copper in micronutrient fertilizers is mainly as CuSO4
⭈5H2O being the most common copper source because of its low cost and high water solubil-
CuSO4
ity  (41).  Copper  can  be  broadcasted, banded, or  applied  as  a  foliar  spray.  Foliar  application  of
chelated  copper  materials  can  be  used  to  correct  deﬁciency  during  the  growing  season  (41).

Limitations may apply to the amount of copper to be applied to land during a growing season. For
example, in  Italy, additions  of  copper  from  fertilizers, including  sewage  sludge, cannot  exceed 
5 kg ha⫺1 year⫺1 (29). Cupric oxide was ineﬀective in correcting copper deﬁciency in the year of appli-
cation  but  did  show  residual  eﬀects  in  subsequent  years  (42).  Copper  sulfate  has  been  shown  to
increase the yield of plantlet regeneration from callus in tissue culture (43). In cereal crops, copper is
required for anther and pollen development, and deﬁciencies can lead to pollen abortion and male
sterility (44). When the concentration of copper sulfate was increased 100-fold over control treatments
to 10 µM, the rate of responding anthers in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) increased from 57 to 72%
and the number of regenerated plantlets per responding anther increased from 2.4 to 11% (44).

10.2.3 PHYTOREMEDIATION
Heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils, aquatic waters, and ground water can pose serious
environmental and health concerns (45). Experimentation into the phyotoextraction of copper from
soils is limited (46). However, approximately 24 copper-hyperaccumulating plant species have been
reported, including members of Cyperaceae, Lamiaceae, Poaceae, and Scrophulariaceae families
(46). Reportedly, the only true copper-accumulating plants are from the central African countries of
Zaïre and Zambia (47,48). The political instability of these regions makes obtaining plant material
for  research  experimentation  difﬁcult  and  has  hindered  the  work  in  this  area  (47,48).  Work  by
Morrison (49) with Zaïrian copper-tolerant plants showed mint species (Aeollanthus biformifolius
De Wild) to accumulate 3920 µg Cu g⫺1 dry weight; ﬁgwort species, bluehearts, (Buchnera metal-
lorum L.) to accumulate 3520 µg g⫺1 dry weight; gentian species (Faroa chalcophila P. Taylor) to
accumulate 700 µg g⫺1 dry weight; and mint species (Haumaniastrum robertii (Robyns) Duvign. &
Plancke)  to  accumulate  489 µg  g⫺1 dry  weight  (47,48).  Rhodegrass  (Chloris  gayana Kunth.),
African  bristlegrass  or  forage  setaria  (Setaria  sphacelata Stapf.  and  C.E.Hubb), two  indigenous
grass species, and oat (Avena sativa L.) were evaluated for copper soil extraction in Ethiopian veg-
etable  farms  irrigated  with  wastewater  from  a  textile  factory, water  from  the  Kebena  and Akaki
Rivers, and  potable  tap  water.  The  maximum  copper  concentration  of  these  plants  was  only 
10.4 mg kg⫺1 dry weight. However, soil copper levels for the experiments ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 mg
kg⫺1, and these low values may indicate low copper delivery from these irrigation sources (50).

Phytochelatins are peptides [(γ-Glu-Cys)nGly] produced by plants in response to heavy metal
ion exposure (51). These compounds function to complex and detoxify metal ions (52). A variety
of metal ions such as Cu2⫹, Cd2⫹, Pb2⫹, and Zn2⫹ induce phytochelatin synthesis (47,48). In addi-
2⫺, induce
tion, cations Hg2⫹, Ag⫹, Au⫹, Bi3⫹, Sb3⫹, Sn2⫹, and Ni2⫹, and anions AsO4
phytochelatin biosynthesis (52). Together with phytochelatin and metallothionein (cysteine-based
proteins that transports metals) (53), internal coordination and vacuolar sequestration determine the
tolerance of plant species and cultivars to heavy metals (18). No induction of phytochelatin syn-
thesis was observed following exposure to Al3⫹, Ca2⫹, Co2⫹, Cr2⫹, Cs⫹, K⫹, Mg2⫹, Mn2⫹, MoO4
2⫺,
Na⫹, or V⫹ (52). Copper phytochelatins have been isolated from common monkeyﬂower (Mimulus
guttatus Fisch. ex DC) (54). Exposure of serpentine roots (Rauwolﬁa serpentina Benth. ex Kurz) to
50 µM CuSO4 in hydroponic culture resulted in arrested plant growth for 10 h and rapid production
of  Cu2⫹-binding  phytochelatins.  Two  days  after  treatment, 80%  of  the  copper  in  solution  was
depleted from the nutrient solution, and the intercellular phytochelatin concentration reached a con-
stant level, and normal growth resumed (52).

3⫺ and SeO3

Some plants have shown a strong potential for hyperaccumulation of copper in their tissues. A
population of aromatic madder (Elsholtzia splendens Nakai) collected on a copper-contaminated
site in the Zhejiang providence of China demonstrated phytoremediation potential after the species
was noted to accumulate 12,752 µg Cu g⫺1 dry weight in roots and 3417 µg Cu g⫺1 dry weight in
shoots when cultured in nutrient solutions containing 1000 µM Cu2⫹ (55). Alfalfa shoots accumu-
lated as much as 12,000 mg Cu kg⫺1 (56). Roots of a willow species (Salix acmophylla Boiss.), an
economically important tree which grows on the banks of water bodies, accumulated nearly 7 to

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 314

314

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

624 µg Cu g⫺1 dry weight in response to increasing copper treatments in soil from 0 to 10,000 mg
kg⫺1 (45). On three soils in Zambia, the roots of a grass species (Stereochlanea cameronii Clayton)
accumulated 9 to 755 µg Cu g⫺1 dry weight in response to a range from 0.2 to 203 µg Cu g⫺1 in
soil (57).

Evidence suggests quantitative genetic variation in the ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals
between- and within-plant populations (58). Populations of knotgrass (Paspalum distichum L.) and
bermudagrass  (Cynodon  dactylon Pers.)  located  around  mine  tailings  in  China  contained  99  to
198 mg Cu kg⫺1. These native grass populations were more tolerant to increasing CuSO4 concen-
trations in solution culture than similar genotypes collected from sites containing much lower lev-
els of copper in soil (2.55 mg Cu kg⫺1) (59). Legumes, Lupinus bicolor Lindl. and Lotus purshianus
Clem. & Clem., growing on a copper mine site (abandoned in 1955) in northern California showed
greater  tolerance  to  0.2 mg  Cu  L⫺1 in  solution  culture  than  genotypes  growing  in  an  adjacent
meadow  (60).  Among  ten  Brassicaceae, only  Indian  mustard  (Brassica  juncea L.)  and  radish
showed  seed  germination  higher  than  90%  after  48 h  exposure  to  copper  concentrations  ranging
from 25 to 200 µM (18). As noted with other heavy metals, copper actually caused a slight increase
in the degree of seed germination, possibly due to changes in osmotic potential that promote water
ﬂow into the seeds (18).

Copper  toxicity  limits  have  been  established  for  grass  species  used  to  restore  heavy  metal-
contaminated sites. Using sand culture, the lethal copper concentration for redtop (Agrostis gigan-
tea Roth.) was 360 mg Cu L⫺1, for slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus Gould ex Shiners) was
335 mg Cu L⫺1, and for basin wildrye (Leymus cinereus A. Love) was 263 mg Cu L⫺1, whereas
tufted  hairgrass  (Deschampsia  caespitosa Beauv.)  and  big  bluegrass  (Poa  secunda J.  Presl) 
displayed less than 50% mortality at the highest treatment level of 250 mg Cu L⫺1 (61). 

Success has been shown with sodium-potassium polyacrylate polymers for copper remediation
in  solution  and  sand  culture;  however, the  cost  of  application  is  often  prohibitive. This  polymer
material at 0.07% dry mass in sand culture absorbed 47, 70, and 190 mg Cu g⫺1 dry weight at 0.5 µM,
1 µM, 0.01 M Cu (as CuSO4
⭈5H2O) in solution, respectively (62). In this experiment, the polyacrylate
polymer increased the dry weight yield of the third and fourth cutting of perennial ryegrass (Lolium
perenne L.) after 50 mg Cu kg⫺1 was applied.

10.3 COPPER DEFICIENCY IN PLANTS
Deﬁciencies of micronutrients have increased in some crop plants due to increases in nutritional
demands from high yields, use of high analysis (N, P, K) fertilizers with low micronutrient quanti-
ties, and decreased use of animal manure applications (40). Copper deﬁciency symptoms appear to
be species-speciﬁc and often depend on the stage of deﬁciency (7). Reuther and Labanauskas (7)
give a comprehensive description of deﬁciency symptoms for 36 crops, and readers are encouraged
to  consult  this  reference.  In  general, the  terminal  growing  points  of  most  plants  begin  to  show
deﬁciency symptoms ﬁrst, a result of immobility of copper in plants. Most plants will exhibit roset-
ting, necrotic spotting, leaf distortion, and terminal dieback (7,33). Many plants also will show a
lack of turgor and discoloration of certain tissues (7,33). Copper deﬁciency symptoms in lentil, faba
bean, chickpea, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were chlorosis, stunted growth, twisted young
leaves and withered leaf tips, and a general wilting despite adequate water supply (33).

Copper deﬁciency limits the activity of many plant enzymes, including ascorbate oxidase, phe-
nolase, cytochrome  oxidase, diamine  oxidase, plastocyanin, and  superoxide  dismutase  (63).
Oxidation–reduction cycling between Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxidation states is required during single
electron  transfer  reactions  in  copper-containing  enzymes  and  proteins  (64).  Narrow-leaf  lupins
(Lupinus angustifolius L.) exhibited suppressed superoxide dismutase, manganese-superoxide dis-
mutase, and  copper/zinc-superoxide  dismutase  activity  on  a  fresh  weight  basis  under  copper
deﬁciency  24  days  after  sowing  (65).  Copper  deﬁciency  also  depresses  carbon  dioxide  ﬁxation,
electron transport, and thylakoid prenyl lipid synthesis relative to plants receiving full nutrition (66).

In  brown, red, and  green  algae, the  most  severe  damage  in  response  to  Cu2⫹ deﬁciency  was  a
decrease in respiration, whereas oxygen production was much less aﬀected (67).

Plants diﬀer in their susceptibility to copper deﬁciency with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oats,
sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense Stapf.), and alfalfa being highly sensitive; and barley, corn, and
sugar beet being moderately sensitive. Copper tissues levels below 2 mg kg⫺1 are generally inade-
quate for plants (9). A critical copper concentration for Canadian prairie soils for cereal crops pro-
duction was reported as 0.4 mg kg⫺1 (42).

10.4 COPPER TOXICITY IN PLANTS
Prior  to  the  identiﬁcation  of  copper  as  a  micronutrient, it  was  regarded  as  a  plant  poison  (7).
Therefore, no discussion of copper toxicity can rightfully begin without mention of its use as a fun-
gicide. In 1882, botanist Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet developed a copper-based formulation that
saved the disease-ravaged French wine industry (68). Millardet’s observation of the prophylactic
eﬀects against downy mildew of grapes by a copper sulfate–lime mixture led to the discovery and
this  copper
development  of  Bordeaux  mixture  [CuSO4
sulfate–lime mixture had been sprinkled on grapevines along the roadways for decades to prevent
the stealing of grapes. The observation that Bordeaux sprays sometimes had stimulating eﬀects on
vigor and yield led to the experimentation that eventually proved the essentiality of copper as a plant
micronutrient (7). It is likely that copper fungicides corrected many copper deﬁciencies before cop-
per was identiﬁed as a required element (69).

⭈5H2O ⫹ Ca(OH)2].  Incidentally,

The  currently  accepted  theory  behind  the  mode  of  action  of  copper  as  a  fungicide  is  its
nonspeciﬁc denaturation of sulfhydryl groups of proteins (70). The copper ion is toxic to all plant
cells and must be used in discrete doses or relatively insoluble forms to prevent tissue damage (70).
There are a multitude of copper-based fungicides and pesticides available to agricultural producers.
Overuse or extended use of these fungicides in orchards and vineyards has produced localized soils
with excessive copper levels (71).

The two general symptoms of copper toxicity are stunted root growth and leaf chlorosis. For
ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seedlings in solution culture, the order of metal toxicity aﬀecting root
growth was Cu ⫹ Ni ⫹ Mn ⫹ Pb ⫹ Cd ⫹ Zn ⫹ Al ⫹ Hg ⫹ Cr ⫹ Fe (72). This order is supported by
earlier experiments with Triticum spp., white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), bent grass (Agrostis spp. L.),
and corn (72). Stunted roots are characterized by poor development, reduced branching, thickening,
and unusual dark coloration (7,14,72,73). Small roots and apices of large roots of spinach turned
black in response to 160 µM Cu in nutrient solution culture (73). Root growth was decreased pro-
gressively in corn when plants were exposed to 10⫺5, 10⫺4, 10⫺3 M Cu2⫹ in solution culture (14).
However, due to the complexity of cell elongation in roots and inﬂuences of hormones, cell wall
biosynthesis, and cell turgor, few research studies have deﬁned the eﬀect of copper on root growth
(74).

Copper-induced chlorosis, oftentimes resembling iron deﬁciency, reportedly occurs due to Cu⫹
and Cu2⫹ ion blockage of photosynthetic electron transport (75). Chlorophyll content of spinach
leaves was decreased by 45% by treatment of 160 µM Cu in solution culture over control treatment
(73).  Increasing  Cu2⫹ exposure  to  cucumber  cotyledon  and  leaf  tissue  extracts  decreased  the
amount of UV-light absorbing compounds (76). Chlorosis of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and bar-
ley  was  observed  with  copper  toxicity  (77,78).  Energy  capture  efﬁciency  and  antenna  size  were
decreased in spinach leaves exposed to toxic levels of copper (73). Copper toxicity symptoms of
oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) leaves included thickening of the lamina and increases in number
of stomata, glandular, and nonglandular hairs, as well as decreases in chloroplast number and dis-
appearance of starch grains in chloroplasts of mesophyll cells (79). Copper ions also may be respon-
sible for accelerating lipid peroxidation in chloroplast membranes (75).

In the photosynthetic apparatus, the donor and acceptor sites of Photosystem II (PSII) are sen-
sitive to excess Cu2⫹ ions (80). The suggested sites of Cu2⫹ inhibition on the acceptor side of PSII

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 316

316

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

are the primary quinone acceptor QA (81,82), the pheophytin–QA–Fe region (83), the non-heme
Fe (82,84), and the secondary quinone acceptor QB (85). On the donor side of PSII, a reversible
inhibition of oxidation of TyrZ (oxidation–reduction active tyrosine residue in a protein compo-
nent of PSII) has been observed by Schröder et al. (86) and Jegerschöld et al. (81). However, Cu2⫹
ions in equal molar concentration to the number of PSII reaction centers stimulated oxygen evo-
lution  nearly  twofold, suggesting  that  Cu2⫹ may  be  a  required  component  of  PSII  (80).
Substitution for magnesium in the chlorophyll heme by copper has been observed in brown and
green alga under high or low irradiance during incubation at 10 to 30 µM CuSO4 (67). High Cu2⫹
tissue concentrations inhibited oxygen evolution and quenched variable ﬂuorescence (87). Brown
and  Rattigan  (88)  reported  rapid  and  complete  oxygen  production  in  an  aquatic  macrophyte
(Elodea canadensis Michx.) in response to copper toxicity. In fact, E. canadensis has been sug-
gested to be a good biomonitor of copper levels in aquatic systems (89).

Excess heavy metals often alter membrane permeability by causing leakage of K⫹ and other
ions.  Solution  culture  experiments  noted  that  0.15 µM  CuCl2 decreased  hydrolytic  activity  of 
H⫹-ATPase in vivo in cucumber roots, but stimulated H⫹ transport in corn roots (90). During these
experiments, Cu2⫹ also inhibited in vitro H⫹ transport through the plasmalemma in cucumber roots
but  stimulated  transport  in  corn  roots  (90).  Copper  toxicity  also  can  produce  oxidative  stress  in
plants. Increased accumulation of the polyamine, putrescine, was detected in mung bean (Phaseolus
aureus Roxb.)  after  copper  was  increased  in  solution  culture  (91).  Fifteen-day-old  wheat  (Triticum
durum Desf. cv. Cresco) roots exhibited a decrease in NADPH concentrations from 108 to 1.8 nmol g⫺1,
a 23% increase in glutathione reductase activity,and a 43-fold increase in ascorbate over control
plants in response to 150 µM Cu in solution culture after a 168-h exposure (94).

In soil, copper toxicity was observed with upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) at an application of
51 mg Cu kg⫺1 to the soil, common bean at 37 mg kg⫺1, corn at 48 mg kg⫺1, soybean at 15 mg kg⫺1,
and  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum L.)  at  51 mg  kg⫺1 (93). An  adequate  copper  application  rate  was 
3 mg kg⫺1 for upland rice, 2 mg kg⫺1 for common bean, 3 mg kg⫺1 for corn, and 12 mg kg⫺1 for wheat.
In this study, an adequate soil test for copper was 2 mg kg⫺1 for upland rice, 1.5 mg kg⫺1for common
bean, 3  mg  kg⫺1 for  corn, 1 mg  kg⫺1 for  soybean, and  10 mg  kg⫺1 for  wheat, when  Mehlich-1
extracting solution was used. The toxic level for the same extractor was 48 mg kg⫺1 for upland rice,
35 mg kg⫺1 for common bean, 45 mg kg⫺1 for corn, 10 mg kg⫺1 for soybean, and 52 mg kg⫺1 for
wheat. Copper (Cu2⫹) signiﬁcantly inhibited growth of radish seedlings at 1 µM in solution culture
(94). Addition of supplemental iron to nutrient solution culture lessened the eﬀects of artiﬁcially
induced copper toxicity in spinach (73). At 10 µM, Cu in the nutrient solution decreased epicotyl
elongation and fresh weight of mung bean, but increasing the calcium concentration in the solution
to 5 µM improved growth (91). Wheat net root elongation, in relation to the original length, was
only 13% in solution culture in response to 1.75 µM Cu2⫹ as Cu(NO3)2, but additions of 240 µM
malate with the Cu(NO3)2 increased root elongation to 27%; addition of 240 µM malonate increased
root to 67%, and 240 µM citrate increased growth to 91%, indicating the potential of these organic
ligands to complex Cu2⫹ and to lessen its toxicity (95).

10.5 COPPER IN THE SOIL

10.5.1 INTRODUCTION
Copper is regarded as one of the most versatile of all agriculturally important microelements in its
ability to interact with soil mineral and organic components (96). Copper can occur as ionic and
complexed copper in soil solution, as an exchangeable cation or as a speciﬁcally absorbed ion, com-
plexed in organic matter, occluded in oxides, and in minerals (97). The type of soil copper extrac-
tion methodology greatly inﬂuences recovery (98). However, soil copper levels in soils correlate
very poorly with plant accumulation and plant tissue levels.

10.5.2 GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF COPPER IN SOILS
Copper exists mainly as Cu (I) and Cu (II), but can occur in metallic form (Cuo) in some ores (40).
Copper occurs in soils as sulﬁde minerals and less stable oxides, silicates, sulfates and carbonates
(40). The most abundant copper-containing mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) (3). Copper can also
be substituted isomorphously for Mn, Fe, and Mg in various minerals (97).

Copper is most abundant in maﬁc (rich in Mg, Ca, Na, and Fe, commonly basalt and gabbro)
rocks, with minimal concentration in carbonate rocks. Maﬁc rocks contain 60 to 120 mg Cu kg⫺1;
ultramaﬁc rocks (deeper in the crust than maﬁc rocks) contain 10 to 40 mg kg⫺1, and acid rocks
(granites, gneisses, rhyolites, trachytes, and  dacites)  contain  2  to  30 mg  kg⫺1.  Limestones  and
dolomites contain 2 to10 mg Cu kg⫺1; sandstones contain 5 to 30 mg kg⫺1; shales contain about 40 mg
kg⫺1, and argillaceous sediments have about 40 to 60 mg kg⫺1 (9). Examples of copper-containing
minerals  include  malachite  (Cu2(OH)2CO3), azurite  (Cu3(OH)2(CO3)2), cuprite  (Cu2O), tenorite
(CuO), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), bornite (Cu5FeS4), and silicate
chrysocolla  (CuSiO3 2H2O)  (40).  Chalcopyrite  (CuFeS2)  is  a  brass-yellow  ore  that  accounts  for
approximately 50% of the world copper deposits. These minerals easily release copper ions during
weathering and under acidic conditions (9). The weathering of copper deposits produces blue and
green minerals often sought by prospectors (3).

Because copper ions readily precipitate with sulﬁde, carbonate, and hydroxide ions, it is rather
immobile  in  soils, showing  little  variation  in  soil  proﬁles  (9).  Copper  in  soil  is  held  strongly  to
organic matter, and it is common to ﬁnd more copper in the topsoil horizons than in deeper zones.
Four tropical agricultural soils (Bougouni, Kangaba, Baguinèda, and Gao) in Africa contained 3 to
5 mg Cu kg⫺1 despite diﬀerences in climatic zone and texture (99). Copper in these soils was asso-
ciated mostly with the organic soil fraction. The minerals governing the solubility of Cu2⫹ in soils
are not known (100).

The global concentration of total copper in soils ranges from 2 to 200 mg kg⫺1, with a mean
concentration of 30 mg kg⫺1 (40) (Table 10.4). Kabata-Pendias and Pendias (9) reported that world-
wide  copper  concentrations  in  soils  commonly  range  between  13  and  24 mg  kg⫺1.  Reviews  by
Kubota  (30), Adriano  (4), and  Kabata-Pendias  and  Pendias  (9)  present  detailed  descriptions  of
global copper distribution. The concentration of copper in soils of the United States ranges from 1
to  40 mg  Cu  kg⫺1, with  an  average  content  of  9 mg  kg⫺1 (30). Agricultural  soils  in  central  Italy
ranged from 50 to 220 mg Cu kg⫺1 (29). Agricultural soils in central Chile were grouped into two
categories: one cluster containing 162 mg Cu kg⫺1 and another cluster containing 751 mg kg⫺1 (36).
However, much of this copper was associated with very sparingly soluble forms and was of low
bioavailability to crop plants. Fifteen agricultural soils in China ranged from 5.8 to 66.1 mg Cu kg⫺1
(101). Eight soils classiﬁed as Alﬁsols, Inceptisols, or Vertisols in India ranged from 1.12 to 5.67 mg
Cu kg⫺1 (102). On the other hand, alum shale and moraine soils from alum shale parent material in
India contained 65 and 112 mg Cu kg⫺1, respectively (103). Five grassland soils in the Xilin river
watershed of Inner Mongolia ranged from 0.89 to 1.62 mg Cu kg⫺1 (101). Four calcareous soils
from the Baiyin region, Gansu providence, China, ranged from 26to 199 mg Cu kg⫺1, the higher
levels resulting from irrigation with wastewater from nonferrous metal mining and smelting opera-
tions in the 1950s (15). Similar copper soil concentrations were found in mine tailings (Pb–Zn) in
Guangdong providence, China (59). The mean copper content of a Canadian soil at 3 to 6.3 km from
a metal-processing smelter was 1400 to 3700 mg kg⫺1 (104).

10.5.3 COPPER AVAILABILITY IN SOILS
Parent material and formation processes govern initial copper status in soils. Atmospheric input of
copper has been shown to partly replace or even exceed biomass removal from soils. Kastanozems,
Chernozems, Ferrasols, and Fluvisols contain the highest levels of copper, whereas Podzols and
Histosols contain the lowest levels.

Chelation and complexing govern copper behavior in most soils (9). For most agricultural soils,
the bioavailability of Cu2⫹ is controlled by adsorption–desorption processes. Permanent-charge min-
erals such as montmorillonite carry a negative charge. Variable-charge minerals such as iron, man-
ganese, and aluminum oxides can carry varying degrees of positive or negative charges depending
on soil pH. Therefore, adsorption and desorption of Cu2⫹ is aﬀected by the proportion of these min-
erals in soils (105). Adsorption of Cu2⫹ in variable charged soils is pH-dependent. Adsorption of
Cu2⫹ in soils is often coupled with proton release, thereby lowering soil pH. Organic matter in soils
has a strong afﬁnity for Cu2⫹, even at low Cu2⫹ concentrations. Copper adsorption capacity of a soil
decreases in the order of concentration of organic matter ⫹ Fe, Al, and Mn oxides ⫹ clay minerals
(105). In the Zhejiang providence of China, a Quaternary red earth soil (clayey, kaolinitic thermic

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 319

Copper

319

plinthite Aquult, pH 5.39, 9.03 g organic C kg⫺1) absorbed a higher percentage of Cu2⫹ added as
Cu(NO3)2 than an arenaceous rock soil (clayey, mixed siliceous thermic typic Dystrochrept, pH 4.86,
6.65 g organic C kg⫺1) (105).

The  solubility  of  copper  minerals  follows  this  progression: CuCO3

⬎ Cu3(OH)2(CO3)  (azu-
rite) ⬎ Cu(OH)2
⬎ Cu2(OH)2CO3 (malachite) ⬎ CuO (tenorite) ⬎ Cu Fe2O4 cupric ferrite ⫹ soil-Cu.
Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations decreases the solubility of the carbonate minerals. The sol-
ubility of cupric ferrite is inﬂuenced by Fe3⫹ and is not much greater than soil copper. Copper will
form several sulfate and oxysulfate minerals; however, these minerals are too soluble in soils and will
dissolve  to  form  soil-Cu  (100). Application  of  rare  earth  element  fertilizers  (23.95%  lanthanum,
41.38% cerium, 4.32% praseodymium, and 13.58% neodymium oxides) increased the copper con-
tent of water-soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, organic, and sulﬁde-bound soil fractions, but not the
Fe–Mn oxide-bound form (101).

Copper availability is aﬀected substantially by soil pH, decreasing 99% for each unit increase
in pH (40). In soil, Cu2⫹ dominates below pH 7.3, whereas CuOH⫹ is most common at about pH
7.3 (40). The concentration of total soluble copper in the soil solution inﬂuences mobility, but the
concentration of free Cu2⫹ determines the bioavailability of copper to plants and microorganisms
(106).  In  an  aquatic  system, Cu2⫹ is  the  dominant  form  below  pH  6.9, and  Cu(OH)2 dominates
above  that  pH.  Treatments  of  87, 174, 348, and  676 mg  CuSO4 kg⫺1 to  an  alﬁsol  soil  (Oxic
Tropudalf) in Nigeria signiﬁcantly acidiﬁed the soil and reduced total bacterial counts, microbial
respiration, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization, short-term nitriﬁcation, and urease activity rel-
ative to untreated soils (107).

Copper ions are held very tightly to organic and inorganic soil exchange sites (9), and CuOH⫹
is preferably sorbed over Cu2⫹. The greatest amounts of adsorbed copper exist in iron and man-
ganese oxides (hematite, goethite, birnessite), amorphous iron and aluminum hydroxides, and clays
(montmorillonite, vermiculite, imogolite) (9). Microbial ﬁxation is also important in copper bind-
ing to soil surfaces (9). Although Cu2⫹ can be reduced to Cu⫹ ions, copper is not aﬀected by oxi-
dation–reduction reactions that occur in most soils (40). In neutral and alkaline soils, CuCO3 is the
major inorganic form, and its solubility is essentially unaﬀected by pH (108). The hydrolysis con-
stant of copper is 10⫺7.6 (109).

Copper forms stable complexes with phenolic and carboxyl groups of soil organic matter. Most
organic soils can bind approximately 48 to 160 mg Cu g–1 of humic acid (9). These complexes are
so strong that most copper deﬁciencies are associated with organic soils (40). Addition of composts
(biosolids, farmyard manure, spent mushroom, pig manure, and poultry manure) increased the com-
plexation of copper in a mineral soil in New Zealand, and addition of biosolids was eﬀective in
reducing the phytotoxicity of copper at high levels of copper addition (106). At the same level of
total  organic  carbon  addition, there  were  diﬀerences  among  these  manure  sources  for  copper
adsorption  (106).  In  this  same  study, a  signiﬁcant  inverse  relationship  occurred  between  copper
adsorption and dissolved organic carbon, indicating that copper forms soluble complexes with dis-
solved organic carbon. Addition of sewage sludge-bark and municipal solid waste compost at about
1000 kg ha⫺1 (containing 126 to 510 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry matter) to a vineyard soil in Italy did not aﬀect
total soil or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-extractable copper but did decrease diethylen-
etriaminepentaacetic  acid  (DTPA)-extractable  copper  (110).  The  copper  content  of  grape  (Vitis
vinifera L.) leaves, musts, and wine were not aﬀected by compost treatment over a six-year period
but were aﬀected by the nearly 15 to 20 kg Cu ha⫺1 applied through fungicidal treatments (110).
Diﬀerences in copper accumulation by bean were observed in response to added poultry manure
(1% by mass). After 2.0 mM Cu kg⫺1 as CuSO4 was added to a Brazilian agricultural soil, bean
plants accumulated 40.5 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight without manure additions, but plants grown on soil
amended with poultry manure accumulated only 16.9 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight (77).

Kabata-Pendias and Pendias (9) report that copper is abundant in the soil solution of all types
of soils, whereas Barber (97) notes that soil solution copper is rather low. According to Kabata-
Pendias and Pendias (9), the concentration of copper in soil solutions range from 3 to 135 µg L⫺1.
Soils of similar texture do not have the same copper concentration (30). The most common forms

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 320

320

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

of copper in the soil solution are organic chelates (9). Deﬁciencies are common on sandy soils that
have been highly weathered, on mineral soils with high organic matter, and on calcareous mineral
soils (111). Although Kubota and Allaway (69) generalized that crop yield responses to copper usu-
ally  occur  only  on  organic  soils, Franzen  and  McMullen  (112)  reported  that  spring  wheat  yield
signiﬁcantly increased in response to 5 lb of 25% copper sulfate acre⫺1 (5 kg ha⫺1) on a low organic
matter, sandy loam in North Dakota and not on soils with more than 2.5% organic matter. Removal
of copper from soils by plant growth is negligible compared to the total amount of copper in soils
(9). An average cereal crop removes annually about 20 to 30 g ha⫺1, and forest biomass annually
removes about 40 g ha⫺1 (9).

Copper extraction from soils can diﬀer by extraction method. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
has been shown to preferentially extract micronutrients associated with organic matter and bound to
minerals  (113).  Copper  extraction  from  soils  in  India  was  highest  for  0.5 N  ammonium
acetate ⫹ 0.02 M EDTA, followed in order by 0.1 N HCl, a DTPA extraction mix (0.004 M DTPA,
0.1 M  triethanolamine, and  0.01 M  CaCl2 at  pH  7.3), and  0.05 N  HCl ⫹ 0.025 N  H2SO4 (102).  In
these  Indian  soils, soil  solution  fractions  contained  0.38%  of  the  total  soil  copper, exchangeable
forms accounted for 1.00%; speciﬁcally absorbed, acid-soluble and Mn-occluded fraction accounted
for 4.47%; and the amorphous Fe-occluded and crystal Fe-occluded fraction accounted for 9.94%
(102). Increasing strengths of ammonium acetate (0.1, 0.3, 1 M) alone was a poor copper soil extrac-
tant; however, the addition of 1 M NH2OH⭈HCl in acetic acid to the sequential extraction procedure
removed  60  to  65%  of  the  total  soil  copper  and  further  extraction  with  30%  H2O2 in  1 M  HNO3
removed another 20%, which was likely associated with the organic soil fraction (103). The remain-
ing soil copper is termed residual (the diﬀerence between extractable and total soil Cu) and is often
approximately 50% of total soil copper (97). In contrast, Miyazawa et al. (77) report no diﬀerences
in  copper  extraction  from  a  sandy  dystrophic  dark  red  latosoil  in  Brazil  by  Mehlich-1  (0.05  N
HCl ⫹ 0.025 N H2SO4), 0.005 M DTPA, pH 7.3 (15.0 g triethanolamine [TEA] ⫹2.0 g DTPA ⫹ 1.5 g
⭈2H2O), and 1 M NH4OAc, pH 4.8. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry or colorimetry has
CaCl2
been shown to work well in the analysis of ammonium acetate extraction methods (114).

Application of copper usually is not required every year, and residual eﬀects of copper have
been reported up to 12 years after soil application (115). Contamination of soils by excess copper
occurs mainly by overapplication of fertilizers, sprays, and agricultural and municipal wastes con-
taining copper and from industrial emissions (9). Copper hydroxide is the most widely used fungi-
cide–bactericide  for  control  of  tomato  diseases  (116).  Due  to  the  intense  use  of  foliar-applied,
copper-containing chemicals, about 25% of tomato leaf samples from greenhouses in Turkey con-
tained over the maximum accepted tolerance level of 200 mg Cu kg⫺1 (31). Due to overuse of cop-
per-containing  pesticides  and  fertilizers, 8.1%  of  210  greenhouse  soil  samples  in  Turkey  were
shown to contain greater than 200 mg Cukg⫺1, the critical soil toxicity level (31).

Localized excess soil copper levels occur in close proximity to industrial sites, but airborne fall-
out of copper is not substantial. Kabata-Pendias and Pendias (9) reported that atmospheric deposi-
tion of copper in Europe ranged from 9 to 224 g ha⫺1 year⫺1. The average copper concentration of
unpolluted  river  waterways  was  approximately  10 µg  L⫺1, whereas  polluted  water  systems  con-
tained 30 to 60 µg L⫺1 (88). After soils were irrigated for one season with copper-enriched waste-
water  from  a  family-owned  copper  ingot  factory  in  Jiangsu  providence, China, copper  levels
increased sevenfold from 23 to 158 mg kg⫺1 compared to other soils in the region (116).

Runoﬀ from tomato plots receiving 10 kg of 77% copper hydroxide solution ha⫺1 season⫺1 con-
tained signiﬁcantly more copper if polyethylene mulch was used between the rows instead of a veg-
etative mulch of vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) (118). Incidentally, the particulate phase of the runoﬀ
contained 80% more copper than the dissolved phase. On a calcareous Fluvisol in Spain, Chinese
cabbage (Brassica pekinensis Rupr.) accumulated 90% more copper under a perforated polyethyl-
ene, ﬂoating-row cover than plants in the bare-ground treatment. The ﬂoating-row cover increased
the air temperature by 6.3°C and the root zone temperature by 5.2°C at a 5-cm depth and 4.3°C at
a 15-cm depth (119).

10.6 COPPER IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL NUTRITION

10.6.1 INTRODUCTION
Copper  was  identiﬁed  as  an  essential  human  dietary  element  approximately  65  years  ago  (120).
Copper  is  a  required  catalytic  cofactor  of  selective  oxidoreductases  and  is  important  for  ATP 
synthesis, normal brain development and neurological function, immune system integrity, cardio-
vascular health, and bone density in elderly adults (120). Animals and humans exploit copper by
cycling the element between the oxidized cupric ion and the reduced cuprous ion for single-electron
transfer reactions (120). Because free or loosely bound copper has the potential to generate free rad-
icals capable of causing tissue pathology, organisms have developed sophisticated mechanisms for
its orderly acquisition, distribution, use, and excretion (120).

10.6.2 DIETARY SOURCES OF COPPER
Aside  from  a  few  select  sources, most  foods  contain  between  2  and  6 mg  Cu  kg⫺1 dry  mass
(120). Of the 218 core foods tested, 26 provided 65% of the required copper intake (121). This
list  included  high  copper-containing  foods  such  as  beef  liver  and  oysters  that  are  consumed
infrequently and low copper-containing foods such as tea, potatoes, whole milk, and chicken,
which are consumed frequently enough to be considered substantial dietary sources of copper
(121).  Whole  fruits  and  vegetables  contain  20  to  370 mg  Cu  kg⫺1;  dairy  products, including
whole milk, contain 3 to 220 mg Cu kg⫺1; beef, lamb, pork, and veal contain 12 to 9310 mg Cu
kg⫺1; poultry contains 11 to 114 mg Cu kg⫺1; and seafood and shellﬁsh contain 11 to 79,300 mg
Cu kg⫺1, with cooked oysters having the maximum value (121). Although dietary copper varies
regionally, geographically, and culturally, a balanced diet appears to provide an adequate intake
of copper for most people. In some areas, additional daily intake of copper can be obtained from
drinking water transmitted through copper pipes. In the United States, the current EPA limit for
copper  in  drinking  water  is  1.3 mg  L⫺1 (122).  In  developed  and  developing  countries, adults,
young children, and adolescents, who consume diets of grain, millet, tuber, or rice, along with
legumes (beans), small amounts of ﬁsh or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable
oil, are likely to obtain enough copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In
developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be
adequate (120).

Forage material containing 7 to 12 mg Cu kg⫺1 dry weight is considered a desirable range for
most  grazing  ruminant  animals  (123).  The  copper  content  of  Chinese  leymus  (Leymus  chinesis
Tzvelev), needlegrass (Stipa grandis P. Smirnow), and fringed sage (Artemisia frigida Willd.) on
grasslands of Inner Mongolia ranged from 0.8 to 2.3 mg kg⫺1 dry matter, and this content was con-
cluded to be severely deﬁcient in copper for ruminant animals (124). The majority of mountain pas-
ture  plants  examined  in  central  southern  Norway  were  unable  to  provide  enough  copper  (28).
Neonatal  ataxia  or  ‘swayback’ is  typical  of  copper  deﬁciency  in  young  lambs, and  ‘steely’ or
‘stringy’ wool is a deﬁciency symptom in adult sheep (124).

10.6.3 METABOLISM OF COPPER FORMS
Copper is absorbed by the small intestinal epithelial cells by speciﬁc copper transporters or other
nonspeciﬁc metal ion transporters on the brush-border surface (120). Once copper is absorbed, it is
transferred to the liver. Copper is then re-secreted into the plasma bound to ceruloplasmin. Human
patients  who  have  abnormal  ceruloplasmin  production  still  exhibit  normal  copper  metabolism.
Therefore, ceruloplasmin is not thought to play a role in copper transportation into cells, and this
process remains unknown (120). A well-supported theory is that copper is transported into cells by
high-aﬃnity transmembrane proteins. Once inside cells of animals, plants, yeast, and bacteria, cop-
per is bound by protein receptor chaperones and delivered directly to target proteins in the cytoplasm

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 322

322

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

and organelle membranes for incorporation into apocuproproteins (64,120). Liver, brain, and kid-
ney tissues contain higher amounts of copper per unit weight than muscle or other bodily tissues.
Copper is not usually stored in tissues and diﬀerences in amounts may be related more to concen-
trations of cuproenzymes. Aside from excretion of nonabsorbed copper, daily losses of copper are
minimal in healthy individuals (120).

10.7 COPPER AND HUMAN HEALTH

10.7.1 INTRODUCTION
Copper has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, dating back to the Egyptians
and Chinese, who used copper salts therapeutically. Copper also has been used historically for the
treatment of chest wounds and the puriﬁcation of drinking water. Today, copper is used as an anti-
bacterial, antiplaque agent in mouthwashes and toothpastes. The recommended dietary allowance
(RDA) for copper was updated in 2001 to 900 µg day⫺1. Because copper is extremely important
during fetal and infant development, during pregnancy and lactation, women are encouraged to con-
sume  1000  to  1300 µg  Cu  day⫺1.  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  the  Food  and
Agricultural Administration (FAA) suggest that the population mean intake of copper should not
exceed 12 mg day⫺1 for adult males and 10 mg day⫺1 for adult females. The Tolerable Upper Intake
Limit for copper intake is 10 mg day⫺1. The adult body can contain between 1.4 and 2.1 mg Cu kg⫺1
of body weight (120).

Copper tends to be toxic to plants before their tissues can accumulate suﬃcient concentrations
to aﬀect animals or humans (125). Copper deﬁciency from foodstuﬀs derived from plants and ani-
mals exposed to low copper levels is more of a concern. The typical diet in the United States pro-
vides copper at just above the lower limits of current RDA levels. The richest food sources of copper
include shellﬁsh, nuts, seeds, organ meat, wheat bran cereals, whole-grain cereals, and naturally
derived chocolate foods (120).

Roots, ﬂowers, and  leaves  of  the  folk  and  naturopathic  herb  species, wormwood  (Artemisia
absinthium L.) and white sage (A. ludoviciana Nutt.) in Manitoba, Canada, accumulated considerable
copper (14.3 to 24.7 µg g⫺1 dry weight), indicating their potential importance for medicinal use (37).

10.7.2 COPPER DEFICIENCY AND TOXICITY IN HUMANS
Acquired copper deﬁciency in adults is quite rare (120), with most cases of deﬁciency appearing in
premature and normal-term infants (126). This deﬁciency can lead to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis
and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic conditions involving bone, connective tis-
sue, heart, and blood vessels, and possibly colon cancer. Other copper deﬁciency symptoms include
anemia, neutropenia (a reduction in infection-ﬁghting white blood cells), hypopigmentation (dimin-
ished pigmentation of the skin), and abnormalities in skeletal, cardiovascular, integumentary, and
immune system functions (120). In infants and children, copper deﬁciency may result in anemia,
bone abnormalities, impaired growth, weight gain, frequent infections (colds, ﬂu, pneumonia), poor
motor coordination, and low energy. Even a mild copper deﬁciency, which aﬀects a much larger
percentage of the population, can impair health in subtle ways. Symptoms of mild copper deﬁciency
include lowered resistance to infections, reproductive problems, general fatigue, and impaired brain
function (126).

Symptoms of copper toxicity, although quite rare, include metallic taste in the mouth and gas-
trointestinal distress in the form of stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms usually
stop when the high copper source is removed. Because copper household plumbing is a signiﬁcant
source of dietary copper, concern has developed for its contribution to elevated copper levels in
drinking water (127). In most environments, copper concentrations in potable water delivered by
copper-containing plumbing tubes are less than 1 mg L⫺1. Toxicity connected to copper-containing

CRC_DK2972_Ch010.qxd  7/14/2006  12:13 PM  Page 323

Copper

323

plumbing  pipes  is  rare, but  examples  do  exist.  Toxicity  symptoms  were  traced  to  contaminated
drinking water in new copper plumbing pipes in an incident in Wisconsin (127). Water levels as
high as 3.6 mg Cu L⫺1 from faucets connected to the new copper-containing pipes were detected.
However, ﬂushing the faucet for 1 min before each use decreased copper levels to ⬍0.25 mg L⫺1.
After  a  few  months, a  protective  layer  of  oxide  and  carbonate  forms  in  copper  tubing, and  the
amount  of  copper  dissolved  in  the  water  is  reduced.  Given  the  population  of  the  United  States
(almost 300 million people) and the widespread use of copper plumbing (85% of U.S. homes), the
health-related cases from high levels of copper in drinking water are extraordinarily rare. In fact,
the antimicrobial eﬀects of copper can inhibit water-borne microorganisms in the drinking water
that resides in the copper plumbing tubing (128).

11.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION

11.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Julius von Sachs, the founder of modern water culture experiments, included iron in his ﬁrst nutri-
ent cultures in 1860, and Eusèbe Gris, in 1844, showed that iron was essential for curing chlorosis
in vines (1,2). Sachs had already shown that iron can be taken up by leaves, and within a few years
L. Rissmüller had demonstrated that foliar iron is obviously translocated by phloem out of leaves
before leaf fall in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The early developments in the study of iron
in plant nutrition were summarized by Molisch in 1892 (3).

It  was  another  100  years  before  the  principal  processes  of  the  mobilization  of  iron  in  the

rhizosphere started to be understood (4–8).

11.2 FUNCTIONS IN PLANTS
The ability of iron to undergo a valence change is important in its functions:

Fe2⫹ l Fe3⫹ ⫹ electron

It is also the case that iron easily forms complexes with various ligands, and by this modulates its
redox potential. Iron is a component of two major groups of proteins. These are the heme proteins
and the Fe-S proteins. In these macromolecules, the redox potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, nor-
mally 770 mV, can vary across most of the range of redox potential in respiratory and photosyn-
thetic  electron  transport  (⫺340  to  ⫹810 mV).  When  iron  is  incorporated  into  these  proteins  it
acquires its essential function (9).

The  heme  proteins  contain  a  characteristic  heme  iron–porphyrin  complex, and  this  acts  as  a
prosthetic group of the cytochromes. These are electron acceptors–donors in respiratory reactions.
Other heme proteins include catalase, peroxidase, and leghemoglobin.

Catalase catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water and O2 (reaction A), whereas

peroxidases catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water (reaction B):

2H2O2

→ 2H2O ⫹ O2

H2O2

⫹ AH2

AH ⫹ AH ⫹ H2O2

→ A ⫹ 2H2O
→ A ⫺ A ⫹ 2H2O

(A)

(B)

Catalase has a major role in the photorespiration reactions, as well as in the glycolate pathway, and
is involved in the protection of chloroplasts from free radicals produced during the water-splitting
reaction of photosynthesis. The reaction sequence of peroxidase shown above includes cell wall
peroxidases, which  catalyze  the  polymerization  of  phenols  to  form  lignin.  Peroxidase  activity  is
noticeably  depressed  in  roots  of  iron-deﬁcient  plants, and  inhibited  cell  wall  formation  and
ligniﬁcation, and accumulation of phenolic compounds have been reported in iron-deﬁcient roots.
As well as being a constituent of the heme group, iron is required at two other stages in its manu-
facture. It activates the enzymes aminolevulinic acid synthetase and coproporphorinogen oxidase. The
protoporphyrin synthesized as a precursor of heme is also a precursor of chlorophyll, and although iron
is not a constituent of chlorophyll this requirement, and the fact that it is also required for the conver-
sion of Mg protoporphyrin to protochlorophyllide, means that it is essential for chlorophyll biosynthe-
sis (10). However, the decreased chloroplast volume and protein content per chloroplast (11) indicate
that  chlorophyll  might  not  be  adequately  stabilized  as  chromoprotein  in  chloroplasts  under  iron
deﬁciency conditions, thus resulting in chlorosis.

Along with the iron requirement in some heme enzymes and its involvement in the manufac-
ture of heme groups in general, iron has a function in Fe-S proteins, which have a strong involve-
ment  with  the  light-dependent  reactions  of  photosynthesis.  Ferredoxin,
the  end  product  of
photosystem I, has a high negative redox potential that enables it to transfer electrons to a number
of acceptors. As well as being the electron donor for the synthesis of NADPH in photosystem I, it
can reduce nitrite in the reaction catalyzed by nitrite reductase and it is an electron donor for sulﬁte
reductase.

11.3 FORMS AND SOURCES OF IRON IN SOILS
Iron occurs in concentrations of 7,000 to 500,000 mg kg⫺1 in soils (12), where it is present mainly
in  the  insoluble  Fe(III)  (ferric, Fe3⫹)  form.  Ferric  ions  hydrolyze  readily  to  give  Fe(OH)22
⫹,
⫺, with the combination of these three forms and the Fe3⫹ ions being the total
Fe(OH)3, and Fe(OH)4
soluble inorganic iron, and the proportions of these forms being determined by the reaction (13):

FIGURE 11.1 Solubility of inorganic Fe in equilibrium with Fe oxides in a well-aerated soil. The shaded
zone represents the concentration range required by plants for adequate Fe nutrition. (Redrawn from Römheld,
V., Marschner, H., in Advances in Plant Nutrition, Vol. 2, Praeger, New York, 1986, pp. 155–204 and Lindsay,
W.L., Schwab, A.P., J. Plant Nutr., 5:821–840, 1982.)

With an increase in soil pH from 4 to 8, the concentration of Fe3⫹ ions declines from 10⫺8 to 10⫺20 M.
As can be seen from Figure 11.1, the minimum solubility of total inorganic iron occurs between pH
7.4 and 8.5 (14).

The various Fe(III) oxides are major components of a mineral soil, and they occur either as a
gel coating soil particles or as ﬁne amorphous particles in the clay fraction. Similar to the clay col-
loids, these oxides have colloidal properties, but no cation-exchange capacity. They can, however,
bind some anions, such as phosphate, particularly at low pH, through anion adsorption. For this rea-
son, the presence of these oxides interferes with phosphorus acquisition by plants, and in soils of
pH above 6, more than 50% of the organically bound forms of phosphate may be present as humic-
Fe(Al)-P complexes (15).

Although Fe(III) oxides are relatively insoluble in water, they can become mobile in the presence
of various organic compounds. As water leaches through decomposing organic matter, it moves the
Fe(III) oxide downwards, particularly at acidic pH, so that under such conditions podzols form. The
iron is essentially leached from the top layers of soil as iron–fulvic acid complexes and forms an iron
pan after precipitation lower down at higher pH. The upper layers are characteristically light in color,
as it is the gel coating of Fe(III) oxide that, in conjunction with humus, gives soils their characteris-
tic color. However, in soils in general, the intensity of the color is not an indication of iron content.
These organic complexes tend to make iron more available than the thermodynamic equilibrium
would indicate (16), and in addition to iron-forming complexes with fulvic acid, it forms complexes
with microbial siderophores (13), including siderophores released by ectomycorrhizal fungi (17). A
water-soluble humic fraction extracted from peat has been shown to be able to form mobile com-
plexes with iron, increasing its availability to plants (18).

In soils with a high organic matter content the concentration of iron chelates can reach 10⫺4 to
10⫺ 3 M (17,18). However, in well-aerated soils low in organic matter, the iron concentration in the
soil solution is in the range of 10⫺8 to 10⫺ 7 M, lower than is required for adequate growth of most
plants (13).

Under  anaerobic  conditions, ferric  oxide  is  reduced  to  the  Fe(II)  (ferrous)  state.  If  there  are
abundant sulfates in the soil, these also become oxygen sources for soil bacteria, and black Fe(II)

CRC_DK2972_Ch011.qxd  7/1/2006  7:15 AM  Page 332

sulﬁde  is  formed.  Such  reactions  occur  when  a  soil  becomes  waterlogged, but  on  subsequent
drainage the Fe(II) iron is oxidized back to Fe(III) compounds. Alternate bouts of reduction and oxi-
dation as the water table changes in depth give rise to rust-colored patches of soil characteristic of
gleys. Ferrous iron, Fe2⫹, and its hydrolysis species contribute toward total soluble iron in a soil
only if the sum of the negative log of ion activity and pH together fall below 12 (equivalent to Eh
of ⫹260 mV and ⫹320 mV at pH 7.5 and 6.5, respectively) (13,14). It is likely that the presence of
microorganisms around growing roots causes the redox potential in the rhizosphere to drop because
of the microbial oxygen demand, and this would serve to increase concentrations of Fe2⫹ ions for
plant uptake (21).

Because the solubility of Fe3⫹ and Fe2⫹ ions decreases with increase in pH, growing plants on
calcareous soils, and on soils that have been overlimed, gives rise to lime-induced chlorosis. The
equilibrium concentration of Fe3⫹ in calcareous soil solution at pH 8.3 is 10⫺19 mM (22), which
gives noticeable iron deﬁciency in plants not adapted to these conditions. It has been estimated that
up to 30% of the world’s arable land is too calcareous for optimum crop production (23,24).

Iron deﬁciency can also arise from excess of manganese and copper. Most elements can serve
as oxidizing agents that convert Fe2⫹ ions into the less soluble Fe3⫹ ions (25), and excess man-
ganese in acid soils can give rise to deﬁciencies of iron although it would otherwise be present in
adequate amounts (26).

Corn (Zea mays L.) and sugarcane (Saccharum oﬃcinarum L.) may show iron deﬁciency symp-
toms when deﬁcient in potassium. It seems that under these circumstances iron is immobilized in
the  stem  nodes, a  process  that  is  accentuated  by  good  phosphorus  supply  (27).  Iron  can  bind  a
signiﬁcant proportion of phosphate in well-weathered soil (as the mineral strengite), and as this sub-
stance is poorly soluble at pH values below 5, iron contributes to the poor availability of phospho-
rus in acid soils (25).

11.4 DIAGNOSIS OF IRON STATUS IN PLANTS

11.4.1 IRON DEFICIENCY
The typical symptoms of iron deﬁciency in plants are chlorotic leaves. Often the veins remain green
whereas the laminae are yellow, and a ﬁne reticulate pattern develops with the darker green veins
contrasting markedly with a lighter green or yellow background (Figure 11.2, see also Figure 1.1 in
Chapter  1).  In  cereals, this  shows  up  as  alternate  yellow  and  green  stripes  (Figure  11.3).  Iron
deﬁciency causes marked changes in the ultrastructure of chloroplasts, with thylakoid grana being
absent under extreme deﬁciency and the chloroplasts being smaller (27,28). As iron in older leaves,
mainly located in chloroplasts, is not easily retranslocated as long as the leaves are not senescent,
the younger leaves tend to be more aﬀected than the older leaves (Figure 11.4). In extreme cases
the leaves may become almost white. Plant species that can modify the rhizosphere to make iron
more available can be classiﬁed as iron-eﬃcient and those that cannot as iron-ineﬃcient. It is among
the iron-ineﬃcient species that chlorosis is most commonly observed.

11.4.2 IRON TOXICITY
Iron toxicity is not a common problem in the ﬁeld, except in rice crops in Asia (29). It can also occur
in pot experiments, and in cases of oversupply of iron salts to ornamental plants such as azaleas.
The symptoms in rice, known as ‘Akagare I’ or ‘bronzing’ in Asia, include small reddish-brown
spots on the leaves, which gradually extend to the older leaves. The whole leaf may turn brown, and
the older leaves may die prematurely (29). In other species, leaves may become darker in color and
roots  may  turn  brown  (29).  In  rice, iron  toxicity  seems  to  occur  above  500 mg  Fe  kg⫺1 leaf  dry
weight (30) (Figure 11.5).

11.5 IRON CONCENTRATION IN CROPS  

11.5.1 PLANT PART AND GROWTH STAGE
Most of the iron in plants is in the Fe(III) form (11). The Fe(II) form is normally below the detec-
tion level in plants (31). A high proportion of iron is localized within the chloroplasts of rapidly
growing leaves (10). One of the forms in which iron occurs in plastids is as phytoferritin, a protein
in which iron occurs as a hydrous Fe(III) oxide phosphate micelle (9), but phytoferritin is also found
in the xylem and phloem (32). It also occurs in seeds, where it is an iron source that is degraded
during germination (33). However, in general, concentrations of iron in seeds are lower than in the
vegetative organs.

A large part of the iron in plants is in the apoplast, particularly the root apoplast. Most of this
root apoplastic pool is in the basal roots and older parts of the root system (34). There is also a
noticeable apoplastic pool of iron in the shoots.

In the iron hyperaccumulator Japanese blood grass (Imperata cylindrica Raeuschel), iron accu-
in  the  rhizomes  in  particular  as  jarosite,
mulates  in  rhizomes  and  leaves  in  mineral  form,
KFe3(OH)6(SO4)2, and in the leaves probably as phytoferritin (35). In the rhizome this accumula-
tion is in the epidermis and the xylem, and in the leaves it is in the epidermis.

11.5.2 IRON REQUIREMENT OF SOME CROPS
Iron deﬁciency can be easily identiﬁed by visible symptoms, so this observation has made quanti-
tative  information  on  adequate  concentrations  of  iron  in  plants  more  scarce  (Table  11.1)  (29).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Furthermore, the so-called chlorosis paradox gives confusing results when critical levels are being
determined. This confusion seems to be brought about by restricted leaf expansion due to shortage
of iron, giving rise to similar concentrations of iron in the smaller, chlorotic leaves as in healthy
green leaves (36). This paradox has been described in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) (37,38) and peach
(Prunus persica Batsch) (39).

In general, the deﬁciency range is about 50 to 100 mg kg⫺1 depending on the plant species and
cultivars  (Table  11.2)  (28).  This  range  is  somewhat  complex  to  determine, as  iron-eﬃcient  plant
species are able to react to low availability of iron by employing mechanisms for its enhanced acqui-
sition (see below), whereas iron-ineﬃcient species are more dependent on adequate supplies of iron
being readily available. In fact, it is apparent from simple calculations that plants must employ root-
induced mobilization of iron to obtain enough element for normal growth (28). Calculations based on
the iron concentration of crops at harvest compared with the concentration of iron in soil water indi-
cate an apparent shortfall in availability of a factor of approximately 2000, and calculations based on
the iron concentration of crops at harvest and their water requirements indicate a shortfall of a factor
of approximately 36,000. Both are very crude calculations, but they clearly indicate that the presence
of plants, at least iron-eﬃcient plants, makes iron more available in the soil than would be expected.
The data indicate a requirement of iron for an annual crop of 1 kg ha⫺1 year⫺1, but even for tree species
the requirement is considerable. It has been estimated that for a peach tree in northeastern Spain, the
amount of iron in the prunings in particular, but also lost in the harvested fruit, in leaf and  ﬂower
abscission and immobilized in the wood, is between 1 and 2 g per tree per year (40).

11.5.3 IRON LEVELS IN PLANTS

11.5.3.1 Iron Uptake
Transport of iron to plants roots is limited largely by diﬀusion in the soil solution (41,42), and thus
the absorption is highly dependent on root activity and growth, and root length density.

The  overall  processes  of  iron  acquisition  by  roots  have  been  described  in  terms  of  diﬀerent
strategies to cope with iron deﬁciency (Figure 11.6) (10,43). Strategy 1 plants, such as dicots and
other nongraminaceous species, reduce Fe(III) in chelates by a rhizodermis-bound Fe(III)-chelate
reductase  and  take  up  released  Fe2⫹ ions  into  the  cytoplasm  of  root  cells  by  a  Fe2⫹ transporter.
Strategy 2 plants, mostly grasses, release phytosiderophores that chelate Fe(III) ions and take up the
phytosiderophore–Fe(III) complex by a transporter (44,45). A more recently postulated Strategy 3
may involve the uptake of microbial siderophores by higher plants (46), although this could be an
indirect  use  of  microbial  siderophores  through  exchange  chelation  with  phytosiderophores  in
Strategy 2 plants or through FeIII chelate reductase in Strategy 1 plants (47,48).

In Strategy 1 plants, one of the major responses to iron deﬁciency is the acidiﬁcation of the rhi-
zosphere, brought about by diﬀerential cation–anion uptake (49), the release of dissociable reduc-
tants  (8,50)  and  particularly  by  the  action  of  an  iron-deﬁciency-induced  proton  pump  in  the
plasmalemma of rhizodermis cells of apical root zones (51). This acidiﬁcation of the rhizosphere
serves to make iron more available and to facilitate the required Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity
(52). There is also an enhanced growth of root hairs (53) and the development of structures like
transfer cells in the rhizodermis (10) as a response to iron deﬁciency.

In  chickpea  (Cicer  arietinum L.)  subjected  to  iron  deﬁciency, anion  and  cation  uptake  were
shown to be depressed, but anion uptake was depressed more than cation uptake (54). This eﬀect
gives rise to excess cation uptake, with consequent release of H⫹ ions in a direct relationship to the
extent of the cation–anion imbalance. The origin of the H⫹ release in such circumstances could be
through enhanced PEP carboxylase activity (55).

The release of reductants increases the reduction of Fe3⫹ to Fe2⫹ in the apoplast, and has been
linked to compounds such as caﬀeic acid (56,57). These may reduce Fe3⫹ to Fe2⫹ ions, and also
chelate the ions either for uptake or for reduction on the plasmalemma. Such reduction of Fe3⫹

CRC_DK2972_Ch011.qxd  7/1/2006  7:15 AM  Page 337

on the plasma membrane involves an iron-chelate reductase. It was thought at one time that there
are two forms of such reductases, a constitutive form that works at a low capacity and is contin-
uously present, and an inducible form that works with high capacity and is induced under iron
deﬁciency  (10).  However, in  tomato  (Lycopersicon  esculentum Mill.), iron  deﬁciency  gives 
rise  to  increased  expression  of  constitutive  FeIII-chelate  reductase  isoforms  in  the  root  plas-
malemma (58). Action of the FeIII-chelate reductase is the rate-limiting step of iron acquisition of
Strategy  1  plants  under  deﬁciency  conditions  (59–61).  Genes  encoding  for  proteins  in  FeIII-
chelate reductase and involved with the uptake of Fe2⫹ in Fe-deﬁcient plants have been identiﬁed
in the Strategy 1 plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and have been named AtFRO2 and AtIRT1, respec-
tively (62,63).

In Strategy 2 plants the phytosiderophores, nonprotein amino acids such as mugineic acid (64),
are released in a diurnal rhythm following onset of iron deﬁciency (43,52). This release occurs par-
ticularly in the apical regions of the seminal and lateral roots (65). The phytosiderophores form sta-
ble complexes with Fe3⫹ ions, and these complexes are taken up by a constitutive transporter in the
plasmalemma of root cells (66). Activity of this transporter also increases during iron deﬁciency.
Mutants such as corn (Zea mays L.) ys1/ys1 are very susceptible to iron chlorosis (44).

In the Strategy 1 species cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), Fe3⫹ attached to the water-soluble humic
fraction  is  apparently  reduced  by  the  plasmalemma  reductase, allowing  uptake  to  occur  (67,68),
whereas in Strategy 2 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), there is an indirect method for uptake of this Fe3⫹
component that involves ligand exchange between the humic fraction and phytosiderophores released
in response to iron deﬁciency (68). Uptake of iron then occurs as a Fe(III)–phytosiderophore complex.
In Strategy II plants, iron deﬁciency also leads to a small increase in the capacity to take up Fe2⫹,
uptake previously thought only to occur in Strategy 1 plants (69).

It has been suggested in the past that the large root apoplastic pool of iron could be a source of
iron for uptake into plants under iron deﬁciency. However, the apoplastic pool occurs largely in the
older  roots  (34), yet  the  mobilization  of  rhizosphere  iron  and  the  uptake  mechanisms  that  are
induced under iron deﬁciency stress occur in the apical zones of the roots, so this seems unlikely
(70). The Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 mechanisms are switched on by mild iron deﬁcit stress, although
under severe deﬁciency they become less eﬀective. They are switched oﬀ within a day of resump-
tion of iron supply to the plant.

The  various  iron  transporters  in  plant  cells  have  been  well  characterized.  They  include
Nramp3  transporters  on  the  tonoplast, and  IRT1, IRT2  and  Nramp  transporters  on  the  plas-
malemma  (71).  Nramp  (natural  resistance  associated  macrophage  proteins)  transporters  are
involved  in  metal  ion  transport  in  many  diﬀerent  organisms, and  in  Arabidopsis roots, three
diﬀerent Nramps are upregulated under iron deﬁciency. A model of iron transport in Arabidopsis
has been shown elsewhere (72).

The transporter used by Strategy 1 plants is an AtIRT1 transporter, whereas Strategy 2 plants

take up the phytosiderophore–Fe(III) complex by ZmYS1 transporters (44,45).

Uptake  of  zinc, and  possibly  manganese  and  copper  also, may  increase  in  Strategy  2  plants
under  iron  deﬁciency, because  although  the  iron-phytosiderophore  transporter  is  speciﬁc  to  iron
complexes, the presence of the phytosiderophores in the rhizosphere may increase the availability
of these other ions both in the rhizosphere itself and in the apoplast (73).

As well as uptake through roots, iron is able to penetrate plant cuticles, at least at 100% humid-
ity. Chelates of Fe3⫹ were shown to penetrate cuticular membranes from grey poplar (Populus x
Canescens Moench.) leaves without stomata with a half-time of 20 to 30 h (74), although at 90%
humidity Fe3⫹ chelated with lignosulfonic acid was the only chelate tested that still penetrated the
membrane. Sachs himself showed that iron is taken up by plants after application to the foliage, and
iron chelates have been applied to foliage to correct iron deﬁciencies because inorganic iron salts
are unstable and phytotoxic (see (3)). Fe(III) citrate and iron-dimerum have been found to penetrate
the leaves of chlorotic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants, and to be utilized by the cells (75),
but it is the chelated forms of iron that enter most eﬀectively.

11.5.3.2 Movement of Iron within Plants

Once taken up by root cells, iron moves within cells and between cells. The understanding of iron
homeostasis at the subcellular level is incomplete, and the role of the vacuole is uncertain. A car-
rier called AtCCC1 may transport iron into vacuoles, and AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 are candi-
dates for transporting it out (72). Of the cellular organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts have a
high requirement for iron, and the chloroplasts may be sites of storage of iron (76). Transport into
chloroplasts is stimulated by light (77), and it occurs in the Fe(II) form (78).

Knowledge of the movement of iron between cells is also incomplete. Experiments in which
59Fe-labelled iron-phytosiderophores were fed to roots of intact corn plants for periods of up to 2 h
demonstrated intensive accumulation of iron in the rhizodermis and the endodermis (72,79). This
accumulation was higher with iron deﬁciency stress, and probably reﬂected the role of increased
number of root hairs and increased expression of the ZmYS1 iron-phytosiderophore transporter.

From the endodermis, the iron is loaded into the pericycle and from there into the xylem. Very
little is known about these processes. Once in the shoots, much of the iron is present in the apoplast,
from  where  it  is  loaded  into  the  cytoplasm  and  into  the  organelles  where  it  is  required.  It  was

thought at one time that high soil pH would raise shoot apoplastic pH and that this action would
make iron unavailable for transport into leaf cells. However, this is not the case, as high root zone
⫺ has  been  shown  not  to  increase  apoplastic  pH  of  leaves  in  both  nutrient-solution-grown
HCO3
sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.) and field-grown grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) (80), a result that is
also  in  agreement  with  recent  experiments  of  Kosegarten  et  al.  (81,82).  In  experiments  on
grapevine, the presence of bicarbonate in the uptake medium was shown to inhibit uptake of iron
and its translocation to the shoots, primarily by inhibiting the Fe(III) reduction capacity of the roots
(83). Also, the  recently  discussed  role  of  nitrate  in  iron  inactivation  in  leaves  and  induction  of
chlorosis due to an assumed increased leaf apoplast pH (82) could not be conﬁrmed (84). Probably,
this nitrate-induced chlorosis in solution-cultured sunﬂower plants is a consequence of an impeded
iron acquisition by roots as a consequence of a nitrate-induced pH increase at the uptake sites of the
roots.

Movement of iron salts in phloem is obviously possible as Rissmüller observed retranslocation
of iron from senescent leaves of beech trees long ago (3). However, it is usually thought that iron
deﬁciency  symptoms  occur  in  young  leaves  rather  than  in  old  leaves  because  iron  is  not  easily
retranslocated in nonsenescent plants. However, such retranslocation is not conﬁned to the senes-
cent leaves of trees, as it has also been observed to occur out of young leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris
subjected to iron deﬁciency (85,86).

Nicotianamine seems to be involved in phloem loading for retranslocation of iron and possibly
in  phloem  unloading  and  uptake  of  iron  into  young  leaves  and  reproductive  organs.  The  maize
ZmYS1  protein  not  only  mediates  transport  of  iron–phytosiderophore  complexes  (87,88), but
experiments on this transporter in yeast and Xenopus have shown that it can also transport Fe(II)-
nicotianamine and Fe(III)-nicotianamine (88). The AtYSL2 homolog of this protein has been impli-
cated in lateral movement of iron in the vascular system of Arabidopsis thaliana (89,90), and its
OsYSL2 homolog in rice has been suggested to be involved in transport of Fe(II)-nicotianamine in
phloem loading and translocation of metals into the grain (91). Expression of a nicotianamine syn-
thase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana in Nicotiana tabacum gave increased levels of nicotianamine,
more iron in the leaves of adult plants, and improvement in the iron use eﬃciency of plants grown
under iron deﬁciency stress (92).

11.6 FACTORS AFFECTING PLANT UPTAKE

11.6.1 SOIL FACTORS
The  major  factor  aﬀecting  acquisition  of  iron  by  plants  is  soil  pH, with  high  pH  making  iron
less available and giving rise to chlorosis. Along with lime-induced chlorosis, there is a whole range
of factors, including the weather, soil and crop management, and the plant genotypes themselves,
that give rise to chlorosis by impeded uptake of iron (Table 11.1). In lime-induced chlorosis, it is
the soil bicarbonate that is the key cause, largely due to the high pH in the rhizosphere and at the
root uptake site, thereby aﬀecting iron solubility and Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity (see Section
11.5.3.1).

One factor that may contribute to rhizosphere pH changes, other than the underlying substrate,
is the nitrogen source. When plants take up nitrate as their predominant nitrogen source, they alka-
linize the rhizosphere and this contributes to iron deﬁciency stress (84,93,94). It has been suggested
that nitrate nutrition could actually raise the pH in the leaf apoplast, making iron less available for
transport into leaf cells. However, this assumption was not experimentally conﬁrmed (see Section
11.5.3.2).

Chlorosis in plant species with Strategy 1 is made worse by high soil moisture, particularly on
calcareous soils, because of elevated concentrations of bicarbonates. A peach tree that was overir-
rigated in an orchard on a calcareous soil developed bicarbonate-induced chlorosis, whereas a tree
that  received  proper  irrigation  showed  no  chlorosis  (Figure  11.7).  In  addition, anaerobiosis  may
make root responses to iron deﬁciency stress more diﬃcult (13). Organic matter content of the soil

can also be important, partly because of the increased tendency toward waterlogging in organic soils
lowering  iron  availability, but  also  because  of  enhanced  microbial  activity  and  the  presence  of
chelating agents in the organic matter making iron more available (13). Furthermore, soil organic
matter, and also compaction of soil, could lower root growth and inhibit iron uptake because of gen-
eration of ethylene (95). Low temperature can make chlorosis more extreme because of the slower
metabolic processes in the roots inhibiting the iron-deﬁciency responses; very high concentrations
of soil phosphate can be deleterious through the adsorption of phosphates on to iron oxides; high
soil  solution  osmotic  strength  appears  to  lower  the  eﬀectiveness  of  iron  chelation  in  Strategy  1
plants; and high concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Mn can induce iron chlorosis through replacement
of iron in soil chelates and phytosiderophores and inhibition of the iron-deﬁciency responses (13).
A summary of the interactions between environmental, edaphic and management conditions, and
plant genotype, concerning the onset of chlorosis is shown in Figure 11.8.

11.6.2 PLANT FACTORS
The two strategies for iron acquisition under iron deﬁciency stress are separated along taxonomic
lines, with grasses (Gramineae, Poaceae) showing Strategy 2, and other plant families and orders,
including some closely related to the grasses such as the Restionales, Eriocaules, Commelinales,
and Juncales, showing Strategy 1 (13).

Iron  deﬁciency  does  not  occur  in  perennial  woody  plants  such  as  grapevine  or  pear  (Pyrus
communis L.)  grown  on  noncalcareous  soils.  For  some  plants  such  as  sunﬂower, deﬁciency  is
uncommon even on calcareous soils. (In experiments in which sunﬂower has been used to examine
the eﬀects of iron deﬁciency, this eﬀect has been achieved at conditions severely inhibiting iron
acquisition, for  example, by  elevated  bicarbonate  concentrations.)  In  general, Strategy  1  plants
show considerable sensitivity in their response to high bicarbonate and high soil pH, high soil mois-
ture and poor aeration, high soil organic matter in calcareous soils, high concentrations of heavy
metals, high ionic strength of the soil solution, and low soil temperature (13). In contrast, Strategy
2  plants  have  a  lower  sensitivity  to  these  factors  but  a  high  sensitivity  to  high  soil  phosphate.
Furthermore, high microbial activity in the rhizosphere can be deleterious due to a fast degradation
of the released phytosiderophores (96,97).

The very term ‘Fe-eﬃcient’ implies that the mechanisms of Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 for iron
acquisition succeed in making suﬃcient iron available to plants for normal growth, and this result
is indeed the case, particularly for Strategy 2 plants. For sunﬂower grown in calcareous soil, there
is a rhythmic response to the low concentrations of available iron that is matched by a rhythmic
uptake of iron (98). Calcicole plants growing in the wild are able to take up suﬃcient iron for nor-
mal growth, although it is probably adaptation to cope with the low availability of phosphorus that
is more important in determining their ability to grow.

The whole concept of iron-eﬃcient and iron-ineﬃcient species raises the prospect of breeding
for eﬃcient acquisition of iron, and the level of knowledge about the genetics of the responses to
onset of iron deﬁciency stress is making this improvement a distinct possibility. It has already been
demonstrated that plants such as grapevines can be grown on iron-eﬃcient rootstocks (Figure 11.9).
Resistance to chorosis may be brought about by engineering crops with increased iron acqui-
sition capability in a number of ways. For example, transgenic rice with a genomic fragment con-
taining HvNAAT-A and HvNAAT-B from barley exhibited enhanced release of phytosiderophores

and increased tolerance to low iron availability through the speeding up of a rate-limiting step of
phytosiderophore  biosynthesis  (99). These  plants  had  four  times  higher  grain  yield  in  alkaline
soils than unmodiﬁed plants. The process of phytosiderophore release can also be crucial for iron
acquisition  (100), and  this  step  could  also  be  improved.  In  Strategy  1  Arabidopsis  thaliana,
increased iron acquisition has been achieved by overexpressing the FRO2 Fe(III) chelate reduc-
tase  (61).  Additionally, plants  could  be  engineered  to  contain  higher  concentrations  of  nico-
tianamine (92).

In addition to increasing the eﬃciency of iron acquisition, it may be possible to increase the
concentrations of iron in harvested crop plants for human nutrition. Much of the world suﬀers
from iron deﬁciency in the diet, and breeding crops such as ‘golden rice,’ which has a higher iron
concentration as well as more vitamin A precursors, would be of considerable beneﬁt to human
welfare (101,102). In wheat, it may be possible to breed from accessions of wild wheat ances-
tors, such as Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides, which contain higher concentrations of iron
in their seeds than Triticum aestivum, to improve the nutritional quality of human and livestock
feedstuﬀs (103).

11.7 SOIL TESTING FOR IRON
Because of the major impact of soil pH and bicarbonate content on the availability of iron to plants,
it is not common to test a soil for iron extractability. Tests of soil pH and lime content are much
more valuable in assessing where lime chlorosis is likely to occur.

Where  testing  of  iron  content  is  desired, early  methods  were  based  on  determining  the
exchangeable iron by extraction with ammonium acetate (104). Nowadays, soil iron is extracted by
the  use  of  a  chelating  agent, in  some  cases  EDDHA  but  more  commonly  DTPA  (diethylenetri-
aminepentacetic acid). This method, ﬁrst proposed in 1967, is used for the analysis of zinc, iron,
manganese, and copper in soils together, and involves adding DPTA to a soil solution buﬀered at
pH 7.3 (105). The mixture contains CaCl2 so that any CaCO3 in the soil is not dissolved, with cor-
responding release of otherwise unavailable micronutrients.

The micronutrients in the extract are measured by atomic absorption spectrometry, inductively

coupled plasma spectrometry, or neutron activation analysis.

11.8 FERTILIZERS FOR IRON
Formation of barely soluble iron hydroxides and oxides, particularly at high pH and in the presence
of bicarbonate ions in the rooting medium, immobilizes iron supplied as inorganic salts. One way
round this problem is to supply Fe(III) citrate, but this is photolabile. For these reasons the supply
of iron in hydroponic culture is usually as a chelate (27). This can be as either FeEDTA (ethylene-
diaminetetraacetate)  or  FeEDDHA  (ethylene  diamine  (di  o-hydroxyphenyl)  acetate).  Both  these
chelates remain stable over a range of pH values, particularly FeEDDHA, although the iron is read-
ily available to the plants. In fact, the whole chelate molecule can be taken up at high application
rates, and as this absorption is by a passive mechanism it is probably at the root zone where the lat-
eral roots develop (106). However, the main uptake of iron chelates in soils or nutrient solutions at
realistic application rates takes place after exchange chelation in Strategy 2 plants (48) and after
Fe(III) reduction and formation of Fe2⫹ in Strategy 1 plants (107). Interestingly, cucumber plants
supplied with inorganic Fe seem to be more resistant to infection by mildew than plants supplied
with FeEDDHA (106).

In  terms  of  fertilizers  for  terrestrial  plants, iron  deﬁciency  usually  comes  about  because  of
alkaline pH in the soil, and supply of iron salts to the soil would have no eﬀect. Foliar application
of Fe(II) sulfate can be eﬀective, typically as a 1% solution applied at regular intervals (25).

CRC_DK2972_Ch011.qxd  7/1/2006  7:15 AM  Page 345

Where iron deﬁciency occurs in acid soils, supply of Fe(II) sulfate to the soil can be eﬀective.
Thus in ornamental horticulture, azaleas and other acid-loving plants beneﬁt from application of
this salt. However, in the ﬁeld, supply to citrus trees on acid soils is not eﬀective as other ions, par-
ticularly  copper, interfere  with  the  availability  of  iron  (25). Application  of  iron  can  be  made  as
FeEDTA or FeEDDHA, but the stability of FeEDTA at least is not high in calcareous soils (25).
FeEDDHA  and  FeDTPA  are  the  only  commercially  available  iron  chelates  for  soil  application
because of their stability at high pH. The synthetic iron phosphate vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2· 8H2O) has
been used on olive trees (108) and in kiwi orchards (109).

Therefore, the  usual  way  in  which  lime-induced  chlorosis  is  alleviated  is  by  supply  of  iron
chelates  such  as  FeEDTA  and  FeHEDTA  to  the  foliage.  Usually  more  than  one  application  is
required (110). There is potential for supplying iron to the foliage of plants as iron-siderophores, as
these microbial chelates are more biodegradable than the synthetic chelates, and so pose less envi-
ronmental risk (111). FeEDTA may also damage the leaves of plants. It is also possible that these
microbial siderophores could be used for root application, at least in hydroponics, as iron-rhizofer-
ritin and Fe(III) monodihydroxamate and Fe(III) dihydroxamate siderophores have been shown to
be taken up by a range of plant species by exchange chelation with phytosiderophores or via Fe(III)
reduction in Strategy 2 and Strategy 1 plants, respectively (48,112,113).

Some of the eﬀects of lime-induced chlorosis on the early stages of plant growth can be overcome
by planting seeds that are high in iron. In the case of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), seeds
from plants grown on acid soils are higher in iron than seeds from plants grown on calcareous soils,
but the seed iron content can be increased by supply of iron to the soil at planting or after ﬂowering
(114). A preplanting application of FeEDDHA has a larger eﬀect on seed yield of soybean (Glycine
max L.) than an application at ﬂowering, but the latter application has a more beneﬁcial eﬀect on iron
concentration in the seeds of both common bean and soybean (115). There is other evidence that the
iron concentration in soybean seeds is under very tight genetic control and is not inﬂuenced much by
the supply of iron, but in that experiment the FeEDDHA was supplied at planting (116).

12.1 INTRODUCTION
The  determination  of  manganese  (Mn)  essentiality  in  plant  growth  by  McHargue  (1914–1922)
focused  the  attention  of  plant  nutritionists  on  this  nutrient, and  led  the  way  for  further  ground-
breaking studies. Since then, research into the concentrations of manganese that confer deﬁciency
or toxicity, and the variation between- and within-plant species in their tolerance or susceptibility
to  these  aﬄictions  has  proliferated. The  symptoms  of  toxicity  and  deﬁciency  have  also  received
much attention owing to their variation among species and their similarity to other nutrient anom-
alies. The diversity of visual symptoms within a species that often confounds diagnosis has been

attributed to soil conditions. Soil pH is one of the most inﬂuential factors aﬀecting the absorption
of manganese by changing mobility from bulk soil to root surface. In addition to research on man-
ganese diagnostics, workers have also focused on the role of manganese in resistance to pests and
disease, revealing economically important interactions that further highlight the importance of this
nutrient in optimal plant production.

This chapter reviews literature dealing with the identiﬁcation of manganese deﬁciency and tox-
icity in various crops of economic importance, the physiology of manganese uptake and transport,
and the interaction between manganese and diseases. In addition, a large table outlining deﬁcient,
adequate, and toxic concentrations for various crops is included.

12.2 FORMS OF MANGANESE AND ABUNDANCE IN SOILS
Manganese  is  the  tenth-most  abundant  element  on  the  surface  of  the  earth. This  metal  does  not
occur naturally in isolation, but is found in combination with other elements to give many common
minerals. The principal ore is pyrolusite (MnO2), but lower oxides (Mn2O3, Mn3O4) and the car-
bonate are also known.

Manganese is most abundant in soils developed from rocks rich in iron owing to its association
with this element (1). It exists in soil solution as either the exchangeable ion Mn2⫹ or Mn3⫹. Organic
chelates derived from microbial activity, degradation of soil organic matter, plant residues, and root
exudates  can  form  metal  complexes  with  micronutrient  cations, and  thereby  increase  manganese
cation solubility and mobility (2). Availability of manganese for plant uptake is aﬀected by soil pH;
it decreases as the pH increases. Divalent manganese is the form of manganese absorbed at the root
surface cell membrane. As soil pH decreases, the proportion of exchangeable Mn2⫹ increases dra-
matically (3), and the proportions of manganese oxides and manganese bound to iron and manganese
oxides decrease (4). This action has been attributed to the increase in protons in the soil solution (5).
Acidiﬁcation  may  also  inhibit  microbial  oxidation  that  is  responsible  for  immobilization  of  man-
ganese. Manganese-oxidizing microbes are the most eﬀective biological system oxidizing Mn2⫹ in
neutral and slightly alkaline soils (6–8). Relatively, as soil pH increases, chemical immobilization of
Mn2⫹ increases (9), and chemical auto-oxidation predominates at pH above 8.5 to 9.0 (10,11).

12.3 IMPORTANCE TO PLANTS AND ANIMALS

12.3.1 ESSENTIALITY OF MANGANESE TO HIGHER PLANTS
The ﬁrst reported investigations into the essentiality of manganese by Horstmar in 1851 (12) suc-
ceeded in identifying this nutrient as needed by oats, but only where iron was in excess. Further evi-
dence for the essentiality of manganese was not made until some Japanese researchers reported that
manganese stimulated the growth of several crops substantially (13,14). These crops included rice
(Oryza sativa L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.), and
because of their economic importance, further interest was stimulated (15). Supporting these ﬁeld
results were the physiological and biochemical studies of Bertrand (16–18). His work reported man-
ganese as having a catalytic role in plants, and that combinations with proteins were essential to
higher plant life. This reported essentiality of manganese was supported by studies by Maze (19) in
solution culture. Studies by McHargue (20,21), where the role of manganese in the promotion of
rapid photosynthesis was determined, are regarded as having established that manganese is essen-
tial for higher plant growth.

12.3.2 FUNCTION IN PLANTS
Manganese is involved in many biochemical functions, primarily acting as an activator of enzymes
such  as  dehydrogenases, transferases, hydroxylases, and  decarboxylases  involved  in  respiration,

CRC_DK2972_Ch012.qxd  7/14/2006  11:19 AM  Page 353

amino acid and lignin synthesis, and hormone concentrations (22,23), but in some cases it may be
replaced by other metal ions (e.g., Mg). Manganese is involved in oxidation–reduction (redox) reac-
tions  within  the  photosynthetic  electron  transport  system  in  plants  (24–26).  Manganese  is  also
involved in the photosynthetic evolution of O2 in chloroplasts (Hill reaction). Owing to the key role
in  this  essential  process,
inhibition  of  photosynthesis  occurs  even  at  moderate  manganese
deﬁciency;  however, it  does  not  aﬀect  chloroplast  ultrastructure  or  cause  chloroplast  breakdown
until severe deﬁciency is reached (27).

12.3.3 IMPORTANCE TO ANIMALS
In humans, manganese deﬁciency results in skeletal abnormalities (28,29). In the oﬀspring of man-
ganese-deﬁcient rats, a shortening of the radius, ulna, tibia, and ﬁbula is observed (30). Manganese
deﬁciency during pregnancy results in oﬀspring with irreversible incoordination of muscles, lead-
ing to irregular and uncontrolled movements by the animal, owing to malformation of the bones
within the ear (30,31). Animals that are manganese-deﬁcient are also prone to convulsions (32).

In  contrast, manganese  toxicity  induces  neurological  disturbances  that  resemble  Parkinson’s
disease, and the successful treatment of this disease with levodopa is associated with changes in
manganese  metabolism  (33,34).  In  animals  manganese  is  associated  with  several  enzymes  (35),
including glycosyl transferase (36), superoxide dismutase (37,38), and pyruvate carboxylase (39).
Manganese requirement for humans is 0.035 to 0.07 mg kg⫺1, with daily intake representing 2

to 5 mg day⫺1 in comparison to the body pool of 20 mg (30,40).

12.4 ABSORPTION AND MOBILITY

12.4.1 ABSORPTION MECHANISMS
As mentioned previously, manganese is preferentially absorbed by plants as the free Mn2⫹ ion from
the soil solution (41–43). It readily complexes with plant and microbial organic ligands and with
synthetic chelates. However, complexes formed with synthetic chelates are generally considered to
be absorbed more slowly by roots than the free cation (44,45).

Manganese  absorption  by  roots  is  characterized  by  a  biphasic  uptake.  The  initial  and  rapid
phase of uptake is reversible and nonmetabolic, with other Mn2⫹ and Ca2⫹ being exchanged freely
(46,47). In this initial phase, manganese appears to be adsorbed by the cell wall constituents of the
root-cell apoplastic space. The second phase is slower; manganese is less readily exchanged (48),
and its uptake is dependent on metabolism. Manganese is absorbed into the symplast during this
slower phase (47,48). However, the exact dependence of manganese absorption on metabolism is
not clear (46,49,50).

Uptake of manganese does not appear to be tightly controlled, unlike the major nutrient ions.
Kinetic  experiments  have  estimated  manganese  absorption  to  be  at  a  rate  of  100  to  1000  times
greater than the need of plants (51). This may be due to the high capacity of ion carriers and chan-
nels in the transportation of manganese ions through the plasma membrane at a speed of several
hundred to several million ions per second per protein molecule (52,53).

12.4.2 DISTRIBUTION AND MOBILITY OF MANGANESE IN PLANTS
The plant part on which symptoms of Mn deﬁciency is observed generally indicates the mobility of the
nutrient within the plant. Manganese has been reported to be an immobile element, which is not re-
translocated (54–59), and consequently symptoms do not occur on old leaves. In addition, symptoms
of manganese deﬁciency regularly appear on fully expanded young leaves rather than on the newest
leaf. This symptom may indicate an internal requirement in these leaves beyond that of the new leaves
(60), or it may simply be a matter of supply and demand in what is the fastest growing tissue.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

The location of manganese in plants is a signiﬁcant factor in the expression of deﬁciency symp-
toms and is aﬀected by its mobility in the xylem and phloem. Manganese moves easily from the
root to the shoot in the xylem-sap transpirational stream (61). In contrast, re-translocation within
the phloem is complex, with leaf manganese being immobile, but root and stem manganese being
able  to  be  re-mobilized  (62).  The  net  eﬀect  of  the  variable  phloem  mobility  gives  rise  to  a  re-
distribution of manganese in plant parts typical of a nutrient with low phloem mobility.

Studies  into  the  mobility  of  manganese  with  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum L.)  (63,64), lupins
(Lupinus spp. L.) (55,65), and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) (56) have reported
no re-mobilization from the old leaves to the younger ones. Further support for this lack of mobil-
ity was given in a study by Nable and Loneragan (57), in which plants provided with an early sup-
ply of 54Mn failed to re-mobilize any of this radioactive element when their roots were placed in a
solution with a low concentration of nonradioactive manganese. The apparent inconsistency with
evidence that phloem is a major source of manganese from the roots and stems to developing seeds
(59,66) can be explained by changes in carbon partitioning within the plant as Hannam and Ohki
(67) reported a re-mobilization of manganese from the stem during the outset of the reproductive
stages of plant development.

12.5 MANGANESE DEFICIENCY

12.5.1 PREVALENCE
Manganese deﬁciency is most prevalent in calcareous soils, the pH of which varies from 7.3 to 8.5, and
the  amounts  of  free  calcium  carbonate  (CaCO3)  also  vary  (68). The  pH  of  calcareous  soils  is  well
buﬀered by the neutralizing eﬀect of calcium carbonate (69). Soils that have a high organic content, low
bulk density, and a low concentration of readily reducible manganese in the soil are also susceptible to
producing manganese deﬁciency. Climatically, cool and temperate conditions are most commonly asso-
ciated with manganese deﬁciency, although there have been reports on the same from tropical to arid
areas. Drier seasons have been reported to relieve (70) or to exacerbate (71) manganese deﬁciency.

12.5.2 INDICATOR PLANTS
Plants that have been reported to be sensitive to manganese deﬁciency are apple (Malus domestica
Borkh.), cherry  (Prunus  avium L.), cirtus  (Citrus spp.  L.), oat  (Avena  sativa L.), pea, beans
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), soybeans (Glycine max Merr.), raspberry (Rubus spp. L.), and sugar beet
(Beta vulgaris L.) (72–76).

Of the cereals, oats are generally regarded as the most sensitive to manganese deﬁciency, with
rye (Secale cereale L.) being the least sensitive. However, there seems to be some discrepancy in
the ranking of susceptibility to manganese deﬁciency of wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
(77–80). This  occurrence  might  be  attributed  to  a  large  within-species  genetic  variation  that  has
been reported for several species, including wheat (77,81), oats (78,82), barley (70,78), peas (83),
lupins (84), and soybeans (85).

Because of their sensitivity to manganese deﬁciency, several species previously considered sus-
ceptible to manganese deﬁciency have been the focus of breeding for more eﬃcient varieties and
may  therefore  not  be  considered  susceptible  species  in  more  recent  publications.  It  is  generally
agreed that grasses (Gramineae, Poaceae), clover (Trifolium spp. L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)
are not susceptible to manganese deﬁciency (76,86).

12.5.3 SYMPTOMS
Characteristic  foliar  symptoms  of  manganese  deﬁciency  become  unmistakable  only  when  the
growth  rate  is  restricted  signiﬁcantly  (67)  and  include  diﬀuse  interveinal  chlorosis  on  young
expanded leaf blades (Figure 12.1) (60); in contrast to the network of green veins seen with iron

ber (Cucumis sativus L.). (For a color presentation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

deﬁciency (67). Severe necrotic spots or streaks may also form. Symptoms often occur ﬁrst on the
middle leaves, in contrast to the symptoms of magnesium deﬁciency, which appear on older leaves.
With eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp. L. Her.), the tip margins of juvenile and adult expanding leaves
become pale green. Chlorosis extends between the lateral veins toward the midrib (60). With cere-
als, chlorosis develops ﬁrst on the leaf base, while with dicotyledons the distal portions of the leaf
blade are aﬀected ﬁrst (67).

With citrus, dark-green bands form along the midrib and main veins, with lighter green areas
between the bands. In mild cases the symptoms appear on young leaves and disappear as the leaf
matures. Young leaves often show a network of green veins in a lighter green background, closely
resembling iron chlorosis (75). Manganese deﬁciency is conﬁrmed by the presence of discoloration
(marsh spot) on pea seed cotyledons (87), and split or malformed seed of lupins (84).

In contrast to iron deﬁciency chlorosis, chlorosis induced by manganese deﬁciency is not uniformly
distributed over the entire leaf blade and tissue may become rapidly necrotic (88). The inability of man-
ganese to be re-translocated from the old leaves to the younger ones designates the youngest leaves as
the most useful for further chemical analysis to conﬁrm manganese deﬁciency. Visual symptoms of
manganese deﬁciency can easily be mistaken for those of other nutrients such as iron, magnesium, and
sulfur (87), and vary between crops. However, they are a valuable basis for the determination of nutri-
ent imbalance (87) and, combined with chemical analysis, can lead to a correct diagnosis.

12.5.4 TOLERANCE
Tolerance  to  manganese  deﬁciency  is  usually  conferred  by  an  ability  to  extract  more  eﬃciently
available manganese from soils that are considered deﬁcient. Mechanisms that are involved in the
improved extraction of manganese from the soil include the production of root exudates (89–91),
diﬀerences in excess cation uptake thus aﬀecting the pH of the rhizosphere (92,93), and changes in
root density (94). The genotypic variation within species for manganese eﬃciency can be utilized
by breeding programs to develop more eﬃcient varieties (95,96).

Tolerance to manganese deﬁciency may be attributed to one or more of the following ﬁve adap-

tive mechanisms (96):

1. Superior internal utilization or lower functional requirement for manganese.
2. Improved internal re-distribution of manganese.
3. Faster speciﬁc rate of absorption from low manganese concentrations at the root–soil inter-

face.

4. Superior root geometry.
5. Greater extrusion of substances from roots into the rhizosphere to mobilize insoluble man-
ganese utilizing: (i) H⫹; (ii) reductants; (iii) manganese-binding ligands; and (iv) microbial
stimulants.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

The  importance  of, and  evidence  for, each  mechanism  has  been  reviewed  extensively  by
Graham (98), and so will not be re-analyzed here. It is concluded that mechanisms 1 and 2 are not
important mechanisms of eﬃciency generally, mechanism 3 may be important in certain situations,
while breeding for mechanism 4 is not thought to bring about rapid progress in improving tolerance.
Mechanism 5 is thought to have some role, though this area requires further investigation.

12.6 TOXICITY

12.6.1 PREVALENCE
Manganese toxicity is a major problem worldwide and occurs mainly in poorly drained, acid soils
owing to the interactions mentioned previously. However, not all poorly drained soils are sources of
manganese toxicity as reported by Beckwith and co-workers (99), who noted that ﬂooding often
increased the pH, thus reducing the availability of manganese. Tropical, subtropical, and temperate
soils have all been reported to be sources of manganese at concentrations high enough to produce
visible symptoms of toxicity. In the tropics, toxicity has been reported in tropical grasses grown in
the Catalina (basalt) and the Fajardo (moderately permeable) clayey soils of Puerto Rico (100), and
in ryegrass (Lolium spp. L.) grown on red–brown clayey loam and granite–mica schists in Uganda,
Africa (101). Among the subtropical regions, toxicity has been reported in subtropical United States
in poorly drained soils and soils on limestone (102) and on ultisols. However, the impermeability
of soils does not seem essential for manganese toxicity (103). In southeastern Australia, manganese
toxicity has been reported in fruit trees grown in neutral-pH duplex soils (104), in French beans
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in manganese-rich basaltic soil (105), and in pasture legumes (106).
There is very little information available on manganese toxicity in temperate regions, though one
report found toxicity on soils characterized by low pH and high concentrations of readily exchange-
able manganese (107).

12.6.2 INDICATOR PLANTS
A number of crops are considered sensitive to manganese toxicity, and these include alfalfa, cabbage,
cauliﬂower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.), clover (Trifolium spp. L.), pineapple (Ananas como-
sus Merr.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), sugar beet, and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)
(74,108). An excess of one nutrient can aggravate a deﬁciency of another, and so symptoms of man-
ganese toxicity bear some features of deﬁciency of another nutrient. Additionally, toxicity of man-
ganese is often confused with aluminum toxicity as both often occur in acid soils. However, in some
species such as wheat (109) and rice (110), the tolerance to these two toxicities is opposite (111).

12.6.3 SYMPTOMS
The visual symptoms of manganese toxicity vary depending on the plant species and the level of
tolerance to an excess of this nutrient. Localized as well as high overall concentrations of man-
ganese are responsible for toxicity symptoms such as leaf speckling in barley (112), internal bark
necrosis in apple (113), and leaf marginal chlorosis in mustard (Brassica spp. L.) (114).

The symptoms observed include yellowing beginning at the leaf edge of older leaves, some-
times leading to an upward cupping (crinkle leaf in cotton, (115)), and brown necrotic peppering on
older leaves. Other symptoms include leaf puckering in soybeans and snap bean (116); marginal
chlorosis and necrosis of leaves in alfalfa, rape (Brassica napus L.), kale (Brassica oleracea var.
acephala DC.), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) (116); necrotic spots on leaves in barley, lettuce, and
soybeans (116); and necrosis in apple bark (i.e., bark measles) (60). Symptoms in soybeans include
chlorotic specks and leaf crinkling as a result of raised interveinal areas (117,118); chlorotic leaf
tips, necrotic areas, and leaf distortion (102) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.).

12.6.4 TOLERANCE
Reduction of manganese to the divalent and therefore more readily absorbed form is promoted in
waterlogged  soils, and  tolerance  to  wet  conditions  has  coincided  with  tolerance  to  excess  man-
ganese in the soil solution. Graven et al. (119) suggested that sensitivity to waterlogging in alfalfa
may be partially due to manganese toxicity, and alfalfa has been shown to be more sensitive to man-
ganese toxicity than other pasture species such as birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) (120). In
support of this suggestion, several other pasture species have also been reported to have a relation-
ship  between  waterlogging  and  manganese  toxicity  (121,122).  For  example, manganese-tolerant
subterranean  clover  (Trifolium  subterraneum cv.  Geraldton)  was  reported  to  be  more  tolerant  to
waterlogging than the manganese-sensitive medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertner) (123). Increased
tolerance to manganese toxicity by rice when compared with soybean is combined with increased
oxidizing ability of its roots (124,125).

Tolerance to manganese toxicity has also been related to a reduction in the transport of man-
ganese  from  the  root  to  the  shoot  as  shown  by  comparison  between  corn  (tolerant)  and  peanut
(Arachis hypogaea L.) (susceptible) (126,127). Furthermore, tolerance to manganese toxicity was
observed in subterranean clover (compared with Medicago truncatula) and was associated with a
lower rate of manganese absorption and greater retention in the roots (123). In an extensive study
comparing eight tropical and four temperate pasture legume species, it was concluded that tolerance
to manganese toxicity was partially attributable to the retention of excess manganese in the root sys-
tem (128). This conclusion was also reached in comparing alfalfa clones that diﬀered in manganese
tolerance (129).

In rice, tolerance to high concentrations of manganese is a combination of the ability to with-
stand high internal concentrations of manganese with the ability to oxidize manganese, thus reduc-
ing  uptake.  This  is  in  comparison  with  other  grasses  that  are  unable  to  survive  the  high
concentrations found in rice leaves (130).

Tolerance is also aﬀected by climatic conditions such as temperature and light intensity (131). For
example, when comparing two soybean cultivars, Bragg (sensitive) and Lee (tolerant), an increase
from 21 to 33⬚C day temperature and 18 to 28⬚C night temperature prevented the symptoms of man-
ganese toxicity in both cultivars, despite the fact that manganese uptake was increased (132,133).

12.7 MANGANESE AND DISEASES
The manganese status of a plant can aﬀect, and be aﬀected by, disease infection, often leading to
the misdiagnosis of disease infection as manganese deﬁciency or toxicity (134). The manganese
concentration  in  diseased  tissues  has  been  observed  to  decrease  as  the  disease  progresses  (135).
This occurrence may be due to the pruning of the root system in the case of root pathogens, lead-
ing  to  a  reduction  in  the  absorptive  surface  with  a  resultant  decrease  in  the  plant  concentration
(136,137). Additionally, microbially induced changes in manganese status, such as that caused by
the grey-speck disease (manganese deﬁciency) of oats have been reported to be due to the oxidiz-
ing bacteria in the rhizosphere causing the manganese to become unavailable (138,139). Manganese
concentration at the site of infection also has been reported to increase, in direct contrast to the over-
all manganese plant concentration, which has decreased (140).

The most notable interaction between disease and manganese is that of the wheat disease take-
all caused by the pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, commonly referred to as Ggt.
The importance of manganese in the defence against infection by Ggt was demonstrated by Graham
(23). Manganese is the unifying factor in the susceptibility of varieties to Ggt under several soil con-
ditions, including changing pH and nitrogen forms as shown in a table by Graham and Webb (141).
The role of manganese fertilizer in the amelioration of Ggt has been reported in numerous papers
(137,142,143). The eﬀect of manganese fertilizer on infection by Ggt has been shown to impact
before the onset of foliar symptoms (137,142).

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the interaction between manganese and disease
resistance.  These  include  ligniﬁcation, with  maximal  levels  reached  at  the  same  concentration
of manganese as maximal biomass production (144); the concentration of soluble phenols, where
manganese deﬁciency leads to a decrease in the their concentration (144); inhibition of aminopep-
tidase, which  supplies  essential  amino  acids  for  fungal  growth, under  manganese-deﬁcient
conditions  (145);  inhibition  of  pectin  methylesterase, which  is  a  fungal  enzyme  for  degrading
host cell walls, under manganese-deﬁcient conditions (146); inhibition of photosynthesis leading to
a  decrease  in  root  exudates  and  thus  becoming  more  susceptible  to  invasion  by  root  pathogens
(142), though this mechanism has been shown not to be important in controlling Ggt by the lack of
eﬀect of foliar-applied manganese (137,147). A plant capable of mobilizing high concentrations of
Mn2⫹ that are toxic to pathogens but not to plants in the rhizosphere may directly inhibit pathogenic
attack (141).

12.8 CONCLUSION
This review has focused predominantly on the function of manganese in plants and its concentrations
for maintaining optimal growth; the vast literature on diagnostics is heavily drawn on in Table 12.1.
Developments  in  the  last  10  years  in  manganese  physiology  and  diagnostics  have  largely  been
reﬁnements on the previous work rather than new radical developments. This may change with the
emerging of new molecular technologies in the area of plant mineral nutrition.

13.1 HISTORICAL INFORMATION

13.1.1 DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIALITY
Molybdenum was discovered in 1778 by the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele. However, its
importance in biological systems was not established until 1930 when Bortels discovered that molyb-
denum was essential for the growth of Azotobacter bacteria in a nutrient medium (1). Subsequently

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

in  1936, Steinberg  determined  that  molybdenum  was  required  for  the  growth  of  the  fungus
Aspergillus niger (2).

The essential nature of molybdenum for higher plants was ﬁrst reported by Arnon and Stout in
1939 (3). In earlier experiments, Arnon observed that minute amounts of molybdenum improved
the  growth  of  plants  in  solution  culture  (4), and  that  a  group  of  seven  heavy  metals, including
molybdenum, increased  the  growth  of  lettuce  (Lactuca  sativa L.)  and  asparagus  (Asparagus
oﬃcinalis L.) (5). Prior to these studies (conducted in 1937 and 1938, respectively) only boron, cop-
per, iron, manganese, and  zinc  were  considered  to  be  micronutrients. The  observation  that  plant
growth was improved by elements other than these led Arnon to believe that the list of essential ele-
ments was incomplete, and prompted him to test whether or not molybdenum was essential for the
growth of higher plants (3).

In their studies, Arnon and Stout tested the molybdenum requirement of tomato (Lycopersicon
esculentum Mill.) by their newly established criteria for essentiality (6). These criteria were (a) a
deﬁciency  of  the  essential  element  prevents  plants  from  completing  their  life  cycles;  (b)  the
requirement is speciﬁc to the element, the deﬁciency of which cannot be prevented by any other
element; and (c) the element is involved directly in the nutrition of plants. Plants grown in puriﬁed
solution cultures developed deﬁciency symptoms in the absence of molybdenum, and symptoms
were  prevented  by  adding  the  equivalent  of  0.01 mg  Mo  L⫺1 to  the  root  medium  (6).  Normal
growth was restored to deﬁcient plants if molybdenum was applied to the foliage, thereby estab-
lishing that molybdenum exerted its eﬀect directly on growth and not indirectly by aﬀecting the
root environment.

13.1.2 FUNCTION IN PLANTS
The transition element molybdenum is essential for most organisms and occurs in more than 60
enzymes catalyzing diverse oxidation–reduction reactions (7,8). Although the element is capable of
existing in oxidation states from 0 to VI, only the higher oxidation states of IV, V, and VI are impor-
tant in biological systems. The functions of molybdenum in plants and other organisms are related
to the valence changes that it undergoes as a metallic component of enzymes (9).

With  the  exception  of  bacterial  nitrogenase, molybdenum-containing  enzymes  in  almost  all
organisms share a similar molybdopterin compound at their catalytic sites (7,8). This pterin is a
molybdenum cofactor (Moco) that is responsible for the correct anchoring and positioning of the
molybdenum center within the enzyme so that molybdenum can interact with other components of
the electron-transport chain in which the enzyme participates (7). Molybdenum itself is thought to
be biologically inactive until complexed with the cofactor, Moco.

Several  molybdoenzymes  including  nitrogenase, nitrate  reductase, xanthine  dehydrogenase,
aldehyde oxidase, and possibly sulﬁte oxidase are of signiﬁcance to plants. Because of its involve-
ﬁxation, nitrate reduction, and the transport of nitrogen compounds in
ment in the processes of N2
plants, molybdenum plays a crucial role in nitrogen metabolism of plants (10).

13.1.2.1 Nitrogenase

The observation of Bortels (1) that molybdenum was necessary for the growth of Azotobacter was
the ﬁrst indication that molybdenum played a role in biological processes. It is now well established
ﬁxation, an activity that is facilitated by the molyb-
that molybdenum is required for biological N2
denum-containing enzyme nitrogenase. Several types of asymbiotic bacteria, such as Azotobacter,
Rhodospirillum, and Klebsiella, are able to ﬁx atmospheric N2, but of particular importance to agri-
culture is the symbiotic relationship between Rhizobium and leguminous crops (10). Nitrogenases
from diﬀerent organisms are similar in nature, and they catalyze the reduction of molecular nitro-
gen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) in the following reaction (11):

ﬁxation takes place biologically at nor-
One of the great wonders in nature is how the process of N2
mal temperatures and atmospheric pressure (12), when in the Haber–Bosch process, the same reac-
tion performed chemically requires temperatures of 300 to 500°C and pressures of ⬎300 atm (13).
According to Mishra et al. (11), nearly all nitrogenases contain the same two proteins, both of
which are inactivated irreversibly in the presence of oxygen: an Mo–Fe protein (MW 200,000) and
an Fe protein (MW 50,000 to 65,000). The Mo–Fe protein contains two atoms of molybdenum and
has  oxidation–reduction  centers  of  two  distinct  types: two  iron–molybdenum  cofactors  called
FeMoco and four Fe-S (4Fe-4S) centers. The Fe–Mo cofactor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase constitutes
the active site of the molybdenum-containing nitrogenase protein in N2-ﬁxing organisms (14).
ﬁxation on the global nitrogen cycle is substantial, with terrestrial
nitrogen inputs in the range of 139 to 170 × 106 tons of nitrogen per year (15). Despite the impor-
tance of molybdenum to N2-ﬁxing organisms and the nitrogen cycle, the essential nature of molyb-
ﬁxation. The primary breach of the Arnon and Stout
denum for plants is not based on its role in N2
criteria of essentiality (6) is that many plants lack the ability to ﬁx atmospheric N2 and therefore do

essential for the growth of legumes if suﬃcient levels of nitrogen fertilizers are supplied (11,16).

The eﬀect of biological N2

13.1.2.2 Nitrate Reductase
⫺ reduc-
The essential nature of molybdenum as a plant nutrient is based solely on its role in the NO3
tion process via nitrate reductase. This enzyme occurs in most plant species as well as in fungi and
bacteria (12), and is the principal molybdenum protein of vegetative plant tissues (17). However, the
requirement of molybdenum for nitrogenase activity in root nodules is greater than the requirement
of molybdenum for the activity of nitrate reductase in the vegetative tissues (18). Because nitrate is
the major form of soil nitrogen absorbed by plant roots (19), the role of molybdenum as a functional
ﬁxation.
component of nitrate reductase is of greater importance in plant nutrition than its role in N2
Like other molybdenum enzymes in plants, nitrate reductase is a homodimeric protein. Each
identical  subunit  can  function  independently  in  nitrate  reduction  (9), and  each  consists  of  three
functional domains: the N-terminal domain associated with a molybdenum cofactor (Moco), the
central  heme  domain  (cytochrome  b557), and  the  C-terminal  FAD  domain  (7,20).  This  enzyme
occurs in the cytoplasm and catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (NO2

⫺) in plants (19):

NO3

⫺ ⫹ 2H⫹ ⫹ 2e2

⫺ → NO 2

⫺ ⫹ 2H2O

Nitrate and molybdenum are both required for the induction of nitrate reductase in plants, and
the  enzyme  is  either  absent  (21), or  its  activity  is  reduced  (22), if  either  nutrient  is  deﬁcient.  In
deﬁcient plants, the induction of nitrate reductase activity by nitrate is a slow process, whereas the
induction of enzyme activity by molybdenum is much faster (10). It has been demonstrated that the
molybdenum  requirement  of  plants  is  higher  if  they  are  supplied  nitrate  rather  than  ammonium
⫹) nutrition (23)—an eﬀect that can be almost completely accounted for by the molybdenum
(NH4
in nitrate reductase (12).

13.1.2.3 Xanthine Dehydrogenase

In addition to the enzymes nitrogenase and nitrate reductase, molybdenum is also a functional compo-
nent of xanthine dehydrogenase, which is involved in ureide synthesis and purine catabolism in plants
(8). This enzyme is a homodimeric protein of identical subunits, each of which contains one molecule
of FAD, four Fe-S groups, and a molybdenum complex that cycles between its Mo(VI) and Mo(IV)
oxidation states (9,13). Xanthine dehydrogenase catalyzes the catabolism of purines to uric acid (7):

purines → xanthine → uric acid

In some legumes, the transport of symbiotically ﬁxed N2 from root to shoot occurs in the form of
ureides, allantoin, and allantoic acid, which are synthesized from uric acid (10). Although xanthine

CRC_DK2972_Ch013.qxd  6/6/2006  1:13 PM  Page 378

378

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

dehydrogenase is apparently not essential for plants (10), it can play a key role in nitrogen metabo-
lism for certain legumes for which ureides are the most prevalent nitrogen compounds formed in root
nodules  (9).  The  poor  growth  of  molybdenum-deﬁcient  legumes  can  be  attributed  in  part  to  poor
upward transport of nitrogen because of disturbed xanthine catabolism (10).

13.1.2.4 Aldehyde Oxidase

Aldehyde oxidases in animals have been well characterized, but only recently has this molybdoen-
zyme been puriﬁed from plant tissue and described (24). In plants, aldehyde oxidase is considered
to be located in the cytoplasm where it catalyzes the ﬁnal step in the biosynthesis of the phytohor-
mones  indoleacetic  acid  (IAA)  and  abscisic  acid  (ABA)  (8).  These  hormones  control  diverse
processes  and  plant  responses  such  as  stomatal  aperture, germination, seed  development, apical
dominance, and the regulation of phototropic and gravitropic behavior (25,26). Molybdenum may
therefore  play  an  important  role  in  plant  development  and  adaptation  to  environmental  stresses
through its eﬀect on the activity of aldehyde oxidase, although other minor pathways exist for the
formation of IAA and ABA in plants (7).

13.1.2.5 Sulfite Oxidase

2⫺) to sulfate (SO 4

Molybdenum may play a role in sulfur metabolism in plants. In biological systems the oxidation of
sulﬁte (SO3
2⫺) is mediated by the molybdoenzyme, sulﬁte oxidase (10). Although
this enzyme has been well studied in animals (27), the existence of sulﬁte oxidase in plants is not
well established. Marschner (9) explains that the oxidation of sulﬁte can be brought about by other
enzymes such as peroxidases and cytochrome oxidase, as well as a number of metals and superox-
ide radicals. It is therefore not clear whether a speciﬁc sulﬁte oxidase is involved in the oxidation
of sulﬁte in higher plants (28) and, consequently, also whether molybdenum is essential in higher
plants for sulﬁte oxidation.

13.2 DIAGNOSIS OF MOLYBDENUM STATUS OF PLANTS

13.2.1 DEFICIENCY
The discovery of molybdenum as a plant nutrient led to the diagnosis of the deﬁciency in a number
of crop plants, with the ﬁrst report of molybdenum deﬁciency in the ﬁeld being made by Anderson
(29) for subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). The critical deﬁciency concentration in
most crop plants is quite low, normally between 0.1 and 1.0 mg Mo kg⫺1 in the dry tissue (12).
Symptoms of molybdenum deﬁciency are common among plants grown on acid mineral soils that
have low concentrations of available molybdenum, but plants may occasionally become deﬁcient in
peat soils due to the retention of molybdenum on humic acids (19,30). Plants also may be prone to
molybdenum deﬁciency under low temperatures and high nitrogen fertility (31).

Because molybdenum is highly mobile in the xylem and the phloem (32), its deﬁciency symp-
toms  often  appear  on  the  entire  plant.  This  appearance  is  unlike  many  of  the  other  essential
micronutrients where deﬁciency symptoms are manifest primarily in younger portions of the plant.
Molybdenum deﬁciency is peculiar in that it often manifests itself as nitrogen deﬁciency, particu-
larly in legumes. These symptoms are related to the function of molybdenum in nitrogen metabo-
ﬁxation and nitrate reduction. However, plants suﬀering from extreme
lism, such as its role in N2
deﬁciency often exhibit symptoms that are unique to molybdenum.

Legumes often require more molybdenum than other plants, particularly if they are dependent
on  N2 as  a  source  of  nitrogen  (9).  Molybdenum-deﬁcient  legumes  commonly  become  chlorotic,
have stunted growth, and have a restriction in the weight or quantity of root nodules (33,34). In
dicotyledonous species, a drastic reduction in leaf size and irregularities in leaf blade formation (whip-
tail)  are  the  most  typical  visible  symptoms, caused  by  local  necrosis  in  the  tissue  and  insuﬃcient 

CRC_DK2972_Ch013.qxd  6/6/2006  1:13 PM  Page 379

diﬀerentiation of vascular bundles at an early stage of leaf development (35). Marginal and interveinal
leaf necrosis is a symptom of extreme molybdenum deﬁciency, and symptoms are often associated
with high nitrate concentrations in the leaf, indicating that nitrate reductase activity is impaired (12).
The  whiptail  disorder  is  observed  often  in  molybdenum-deﬁcient  cauliﬂower  (Brassica
oleracea var. botrytis L.), one of the most sensitive cruciferous crops to low molybdenum nutrition
(36). In addition, molybdenum-deﬁcient beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) often develop scald, where
the leaves are pale with interveinal and marginal chlorosis, followed by burning of the leaf margin
(36,37).  In  molybdenum-deﬁcient  tomatoes, lower  leaves  appear  mottled  and  eventually  cup
upward and develop marginal necrosis (3). Molybdenum deﬁciency also decreases tasseling and
inhibits anthesis and pollen formation in corn (Zea mays L.) (38). The inhibition of pollen forma-
tion with molybdenum deﬁciency may explain the lack of fruit formation in molybdenum-deﬁcient
watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) (9,39).

13.2.2 EXCESS
Most plants are not particularly sensitive to excessive molybdenum in the nutrient medium, and the crit-
ical toxicity concentration of molybdenum in plants varies widely. For instance, molybdenum is toxic
to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) if leaf tissue levels exceed 135 mg Mo kg⫺1 (40), but crops such as
cauliﬂower and onion (Allium cepa L.) are able to accumulate upwards of 600 mg Mo kg⫺1 without
exhibiting symptoms of toxicity (41). However, tissue concentrations ⬎500 mg Mo kg⫺1 can lead to a
toxic response in many plants (42), which is characterized by malformation of the leaves, a golden-yel-
low discoloration of the shoot tissues (9), and inhibition of root and shoot growth (43). These symp-
toms may, in part, be the result of inhibition of iron metabolism by molybdenum in the plant (12).

Toxicity symptoms in plants under ﬁeld conditions are very rare, whereas toxicity to animals
feeding on forages high in this element is well known (44). A narrow span exists between nutritional
deﬁciency for plants and toxicity to ruminants (45). Molybdenum concentrations ⬎10 mg Mo kg⫺1
(dry mass) in forage crops can cause a nutritional disorder called molybdenosis in grazing rumi-
nants (9). This disorder is a molybdenum-induced copper deﬁciency that occurs when the consumed
2⫺)  reacts  in  the  rumen  with  sulfur  to  form  thiomolybdate  complexes, which
molybdate  (MoO4
inhibit copper metabolism (46).

Agricultural  practices  that  can  be  used  to  decrease  ruminant  susceptibility  to  molybdenosis
include ﬁeld applications of copper and sulfur. The strong depressive eﬀects of SO4
2⫺
2⫺ on MoO4
uptake  can  lower  the  molybdenum  concentration  in  plants  to  levels  that  are  nontoxic  (47).
Increasing the copper content of forages through fertilization may also help to reduce molybdenum-
induced copper deﬁciency in animals (46).

13.2.3 MOLYBDENUM CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN PLANTS
The requirement of plants for molybdenum is lower than any other mineral nutrient except nickel
(Ni) (9). Plants diﬀer in their ability to absorb molybdenum from the root medium (48), and the
suﬃciency  range  for  molybdenum  in  plants  varies  widely  (Table  13.1).  Most  plants  contain
suﬃcient levels of molybdenum—in the range of 0.2 to 2.0 mg Mo kg⫺1—in their dry tissue, but
the diﬀerence between the critical deﬁciency and toxicity levels can vary up to a factor of 104 (e.g.,
0.1 to 1000 mg Mo kg⫺1 dry mass) (9).

The source of nitrogen supplied to plants inﬂuences their requirement for molybdenum. Nitrate-
fed plants generally have a high requirement for molybdenum (66), but there are conﬂicting reports as
to  whether  plants  supplied  with  reduced  nitrogen  have  a  molybdenum  requirement.  Cauliﬂower
developed symptoms of molybdenum deﬁciency when grown with ammonium salts, urea, glutamate,
or nitrate, in the absence of molybdenum (20). However, Hewitt (67) suggested that the molybdenum
requirement, in  the  presence  of  reduced  nitrogen, may  result  from  the  eﬀects  of  traces  of  nitrate
derived from bacterial nitriﬁcation. When cauliﬂower plants were supplied ammonium sulfate and no

molybdenum under sterile conditions, Hewitt and Gundry (68) found that plants showed no abnor-
malities and apparently had no molybdenum requirement. On transfer to nonsterile conditions, whip-
tail  symptoms  appeared  as  a  characteristic  symptom  of  molybdenum  deﬁciency.  Hewitt  (17)  later
stated that molybdenum is of very little importance for some plants if nitrate reduction is not neces-
sary for nitrogen assimilation, but that it is impossible to say that an element is not required by plants
given the limits of current analytical techniques.

Molybdenum  is  absorbed  by  plant  roots  in  the  form  of  the  molybdate  ion  (MoO4

2⫺), and  its
uptake  is  considered  to  be  controlled  metabolically  (19).  In  long-distance  transport  in  plants,
molybdenum is readily mobile in the xylem and phloem (32). The form in which molybdenum is
translocated is unknown, but its chemical properties indicate that it is most likely transported as
2⫺ rather than in a complexed form (9). The proportion of various molybdenum constituents
MoO4
in plants naturally depends on the quantity of molybdenum absorbed and accumulated in the tissue.
Molybdenum-containing  enzymes, such  as  nitrogenase  and  nitrate  reductase, constitute  a  major
pool for absorbed molybdenum, but under conditions of luxury consumption, excess molybdenum
can also be stored in the vacuoles of peripheral cell layers of the plant (69).

The allocation of molybdenum to the various plant organs varies considerably among plant species,
but generally the concentration of molybdenum is highest in seeds (12) and in the nodules of N2-ﬁxing
plants (9). However, when molybdenum is limiting, preferential accumulation in root nodules may lead
to  considerably  lower  molybdenum  content  in  the  shoots  and  seeds  of  nodulated  legumes  (70).
Molybdenum concentrations in leaves have been found to exceed concentrations in the stems of sev-
eral crop species such as tomato, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and soybeans (Glycine max Merr.) (12).

13.2.4 ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF MOLYBDENUM IN PLANTS
The molybdenum status of crops is often overlooked by the farming community, probably because
of the relatively low crop requirement for molybdenum and because of a lack of education on the
necessity of molybdenum in fertility programs. In addition, many commercial soil and plant analy-
sis laboratories fail to report this nutrient in routine tissue and soil analyses. This omission may be
partially due to the diﬃculties in accurately determining the small quantities of molybdenum that are
normally present in plant tissues. It is possible that many molybdenum deﬁciencies in crop plants are
misdiagnosed as nitrogen deﬁciency because of the similarity in their deﬁciency symptoms.

The two most common methods of molybdenum extraction from plant tissues are dry ashing (71)
and wet digestion (72), both of which give similar results (12). Dry ashing is often the preferred
method of extraction due to the potential hazards involved with the use of perchloric acid (HClO4)
for wet digestion (72). Several analytical techniques have been proposed for the determination of
molybdenum in the resulting extracts including the dithiol and thiocyanate colorimetric methods,
determination by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), graphite furnace atomic absorption spec-
trometry (GF-AAS), and by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
As the detection of molybdenum by ICP-AES is less sensitive than for other elements, this method
should be used only for plant tissues suspected of having molybdenum concentrations ⬎1.0 mg Mo
kg⫺1 (dry mass) (73,74). The dithiol colorimetric method and the AAS method are probably the most
commonly used techniques for determining molybdenum in soil and plant materials (12).

The  dithiol  method  developed  by  Piper  and  Beckworth  (75)  and  modiﬁed  by  Gupta  and
MacKay (76) is more sensitive and precise than other colorimetric methods used for the determi-
nation of molybdenum in plant tissues. This method is based on precipitation and extraction of a
green-colored molybdenum dithiol complex after removal of interfering ions from the test solution
(77). The  molybdenum  concentration  is  determined  by  comparing  the  absorbance  of  the  sample
with known standards on a light spectrophotometer. The detection limit of the dithiol method is
about 20 ng Mo mL⫺1, and the recovery of molybdenum added to the plant material has been greater
than 90% (12). Although this method is relatively inexpensive, the procedure may be too tedious
and  time-consuming  for  use  in  many  commercial  analytical  laboratories.  For  procedures  of  the
dithiol method, readers are referred to Gupta (73).

Trace  quantities  of  molybdenum  in  plant  material  have  been  determined  by  ﬂame  (78)  or
ﬂameless AAS (79). These procedures provide adequate sensitivity for molybdenum and are rela-
tively rapid, but are subject to matrix interferences (77). The GF-AAS method (80) improves the
accuracy and precision of determining low concentrations of molybdenum, and the procedure is
applicable to a range of diﬀerent plant matrices (73). The detection limits for the determination of
molybdenum by AAS using ﬂame and graphite furnace are reported to be 10 and 2 ng mL⫺1, respec-
tively (78), and the recovery of molybdenum by these two methods is similar to that of the dithiol
colorimetric method, ranging from 92 to 95% (12). For details of the ﬂame and graphite furnace
AAS methods, the reader is referred to Khan et al. (78) and Gupta (73).

13.3 ASSESSMENT OF MOLYBDENUM STATUS OF SOILS

13.3.1 SOIL MOLYBDENUM CONTENT
The amount of naturally occurring molybdenum in soils depends on the molybdenum concentrations
in the parent materials. Igneous rock makes up some 95% of the Earth crust (81) and contains ∼2 mg
Mo kg⫺1. Similar amounts of molybdenum are present in sedimentary rock (82). The total molybde-
num content of soils diﬀers by soil type and sometimes by geographical region (Table 13.2). Soils nor-
mally  contain  between  0.013  and  17.0 mg  kg⫺1 total  molybdenum  (44), but  molybdenum
concentrations can exceed 300 mg Mo kg⫺1 in soils derived from organic-rich shale (83). Large quan-
tities of molybdenum also occur in soils receiving applications of municipal sewage sludge (84) or in
soils that are polluted by mining activities (46). Most agricultural soils contain a relatively low amount

of molybdenum by comparison, with an average of 2.0 mg kg⫺1 total molybdenum and 0.2 mg kg⫺1
available molybdenum (19).

Soils derived from granite, organic-rich shale, or limestone, and those high in organic matter are
usually rich in molybdenum (85,86), and the available molybdenum content generally increases with
alkalinity  or  ﬁneness  of  the  soil  texture  (85).  In  contrast, molybdenum  is  often  deﬁcient  in  well-
drained coarse-textured soils or in soils that are highly weathered or acidic (83,87). The accumulation
of molybdenum varies with depth in the soil, but molybdenum is normally highest in the A horizons
of well-drained soils and is highest in the subsoil of poorly drained mineral soils (83). In soils, molyb-
denum can occur in four fractions: (a) dissolved molybdenum in the soil solution, (b) molybdenum
occluded with oxides, (c) molybdenum as a mineral constituent, and (d) molybdenum associated with
organic matter (85).

2⫺ (84), but  at  lower  pH  levels  the  HMoO4

13.3.2 FORMS OF MOLYBDENUM IN SOILS
The speciation and availability of molybdenum in the soil solution is a function of pH. At water pH
⬎5.0, molybdenum  exists  primarily  as  MoO4
⫺ and
0 forms dominate (44). For each unit increase in soil pH above pH 5.0, the soluble molyb-
H2MoO4
2⫺ and therefore the
denum concentration increases 100-fold (88). Plants preferentially absorb MoO4
molybdenum nutrition of plants can be manipulated by altering soil acidity. Soil liming is commonly
used  to  alleviate  molybdenum  deﬁciencies  in  plants  by  increasing  the  quantity  of  plant-available
molybdenum in the soil solution (89), but the eﬀect of liming on molybdenum nutrition varies by soil
and plant type (Table 13.3). Excessive lime use may decrease the solubility of molybdenum through
the formation of CaMoO4 (44), but Lindsay (90) suggests that this complex is too soluble to persist
in soils. Using lime to change the acidity of a clay loam from pH 5 to 6.5 resulted in greater molyb-
denum accumulation in cauliﬂower, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and bromegrass (Bromus inermis
Leyss.), but molybdenum accumulation was relatively unaﬀected if plants were grown in a sandy
loam (Table 13.3) (87). For plants grown in sandy loam, lime and molybdenum were both required
to signiﬁcantly increase the molybdenum content of the plant tissue.

Molybdenum

385

Signiﬁcant  amounts  of  molybdenum  can  be  bound, or  ﬁxed, in  soils  by  iron  and  aluminum
oxides, particularly under acidic conditions (19). These sesquioxides have a pH-dependent surface
charge that becomes more electrically positive as soil pH decreases, and more negative as soil pH
increases. Changes in the surface charge are due to the protonation and deprotonation of surface
functional groups (91). Under acidic soil conditions, the molybdate anion is adsorbed strongly to
the surface of iron and aluminum oxides by a ligand exchange mechanism (92), and adsorption is
greatest at pH 4 (83). In acid soils the molybdenum concentration in the soil solution can be reduced
greatly, but because molybdenum is adsorbed weakly to soils and hydrous oxides at alkaline pH,
these soils have a relatively large proportion of molybdenum in the solution phase (93). Compared
with adsorption on hydrous iron oxides, the strength of molybdenum adsorption to aluminum oxide
is much weaker (94). Despite this diﬀerence, aluminum oxides play an important role in the sorp-
tion of molybdenum in soils. For instance, the adsorption capacity of montmorillonite increases in
the presence of interlayered aluminum hydroxide polymers (85).

Molybdenum also exists in soils as a constituent of various molybdenum-containing minerals. The
primary source of molybdenum in soils is molybdenite (MoS2), but other minerals also contribute to
the molybdenum content of soils, such as powellite (CaMoO4), wulfenite (PbMoO4), and ferrimolyb-
dite  (Fe2(MoO4)3 · 8H2O)  (95).  Of  these  minerals, only  molybdenite  and  ferrimolybdite  are  mined
commercially (83). In water-saturated soils, the availability of molybdenum is inﬂuenced by its reac-
tion with other redox-active elements such as sulfur. Under strongly reducing conditions molybdenum
forms sparingly soluble thiomolybdate complexes, with MoS2 being the most important mineral con-
trolling molybdenum solubility (44). Other minerals whose ions are also aﬀected by oxidation–reduc-
tion state, such as MnMoO4 or FeMoO4, are too soluble to precipitate in soils (92). Soil pH greatly
inﬂuences the availability of molybdenum from these mineral sources; even PbMoO4, the least solu-
ble of the possible soil compounds, becomes more soluble as pH increases (87).

Soil organic matter has been found to complex or ﬁx molybdenum in soils, but the mechanisms
of  sorption  are  not  well  understood.  Molybdenum  binds  strongly  to  humic  and  fulvic  acids  (92).
Owing to the great aﬃnity of molybdenum to be ﬁxed by organic matter, its concentration in forest
litter can reach 50 mg Mo kg⫺1 (44). The accumulation of molybdenum in organic matter can be par-
ticularly high if soil drainage is impeded (95). Organic-matter-rich soils can supply adequate amounts
of molybdenum for plant growth due to a slow release of molybdenum from the organic complex (44).
However, there are conﬂicting reports concerning the eﬀect of soil organic matter on the availability
of molybdenum in the soil solution. Plant-available molybdenum has been reported to be low in soils
having high quantities of organic matter (96), particularly on peat soils due to the strong ﬁxation of
molybdenum by humic acid (44). In contrast, Srivastiva and Gupta (85) suggested that soil organic
matter increases the available molybdenum content of acid soils by inhibiting the ﬁxation of MoO4
2⫺
by sesquioxides.

13.3.3 INTERACTIONS WITH PHOSPHORUS AND SULFUR
The molybdenum nutrition of plants can be aﬀected by the interaction of molybdenum with other
nutrients in the soil such as phosphorus and sulfur. It is well established that plant uptake of molyb-
denum is enhanced by the presence of soluble phosphorus and decreased by the presence of avail-
2⫺, phosphate has a greater aﬃnity for sorption sites in soils,
able sulfur (87). In comparison to MoO4
such as on sesquioxides (92). Phosphorus fertilization often liberates soil-bound molybdenum into
the soil solution and increases molybdenum accumulation by plants (85,97). Phosphorus may also
stimulate molybdenum absorption through the formation of a phosphomolybdate complex in soils,
which may be readily absorbed by plants (98). The eﬀect of sulfur on molybdenum absorption by
2⫺ during root absorp-
2⫺ and MoO4
plants appears to be related to the direct competition between SO4
2⫺ to  the  culture  medium  reduced
tion.  Stout  and  Meagher  (99)  showed  that  the  addition  of  SO4
absorption  of  radioactive  molybdenum  by  tomatoes, and  decreased  molybdenum  absorption  by
tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.) in soil (100).

13.3.4 SOIL ANALYSIS
The use of soil testing to predict the soil’s capacity to supply molybdenum for plant growth can be
diﬃcult because of the relatively small amounts of molybdenum in soil, the diﬀerences in plant
requirement for molybdenum, and because of the importance of seed molybdenum reserves in sup-
plying crop needs (74). In addition, the total molybdenum content of soils can diﬀer considerably
from the plant-available molybdenum fraction (77). The total molybdenum content in soils usually
ranges between 0.013 and 17.0 mg Mo kg⫺1 (44) and is dependent on the molybdenum content of
the parent material (101). However, the quantity of molybdenum available for plant uptake can be
substantially less and is dependent on soil pH and other chemical and biological factors. For pollu-
tion monitoring, a method for determining the total molybdenum in soils is necessary. If the objec-
tive is to quantify the available molybdenum for plant uptake, then a method for determination of
the mobile or readily extractable molybdenum is required (77).

Several excellent reviews on the determination of molybdenum in soils are provided by Sims
(84), Eivazi and Sims (77), and Sims and Eivazi (74). The reader is referred to these references for
detailed explanations of methods and procedures described here.

13.3.4.1 Determination of Total Molybdenum in Soil

Several extraction methods have been developed for the determination of molybdenum in soils. The
most common method of soil extraction is by perchloric acid digestion (102). Dry ashing followed
by  acid  extraction  of  the  ash  has  also  been  used  (103).  Purvis  and  Peterson  (104)  proposed  the
sodium carbonate fusion method for extraction of total molybdenum.

The  thiocyanate–stannous  chloride  spectrophotometric  procedure  revised  by  Johnson  and
Arkley (105) and modiﬁed by Sims (84), is used extensively for the determination of total molyb-
denum in soils. Details of the procedure are provided by Sims (84). Molybdenum in the soil extract
reacts with thiocyanate and excess iron in the presence of stannous chloride to form the colored
complex Fe(MoO(SCN)5). The complex is extracted from the aqueous phase with isoamyl alcohol
that has been dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The amount of molybdenum present is deter-
mined on a light spectrophotometer by comparison of the absorbance of the sample with appropri-
ate standards. Diﬃculties associated with the thiocyanate method include interference from iron and
the use of stannous chloride, which can vary in purity and consistency (77).

Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry has also been used for the analysis of extract
having a low concentration of molybdenum (⬍1.0 mg kg⫺1) (106,107). For extracts high in molyb-
denum, AAS or ICP-AES have been used, but Sims (84) indicates that owing to low detection lim-
its, interferences from other elements, or the enhancement of molybdenum readings, the usefulness
of these methods is limited.

13.3.4.2 Determination of Available Molybdenum in Soil
According to Gupta and Lipsett (12), the ﬁrst report on the available molybdenum in soils was given
by Grigg (103) wherein soils were extracted with acid oxalate buﬀered at pH 3. Other extractants
have been used with varying degrees of success for the determination of available molybdenum in
soils including ammonium oxalate, hot water, anion-exchange resin, and ammonium bicarbonate-
diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA) (84). The most common method for the determi-
nation of molybdenum in soil extracts is the thiocyanate method as described previously.

Although the ammonium oxalate procedure is the method most commonly used to determine
available molybdenum in soils, the ﬁndings have not been consistent (77). Grigg (108) decided that
the method was unreliable for diagnosis of molybdenum deﬁciencies, because oxalate extracts a por-
tion of iron-bound molybdenum that is unavailable to plants. Water extraction has been shown to be
well  correlated  with  available  molybdenum  in  some  studies  (109), but  has  failed  to  give  positive
results  in  others  (110).  Diﬃculties  are  encountered  with  water  extraction  because  the  quantities

CRC_DK2972_Ch013.qxd  6/6/2006  1:13 PM  Page 387

Molybdenum

387

extracted are very low (12). Sims (84) indicates that anion-exchange resins have been used with suc-
cess to extract molybdenum, but that the method has not been tested widely.

According to Sims and Eivazi (74), the AB-DTPA method was developed for the simultaneous
soil  extraction  of  macronutrients  and  micronutrients  such  as  phosphorus, potassium, iron, man-
ganese, copper, and zinc, and the method has been extended to include molybdenum. Molybdenum
extracted with AB-DTPA increases with increasing soil pH (84), and the method has been used most
often for soils or sediments high in molybdenum, such as calcareous or polluted soils (111,112).
Because the extractant can be used in conjunction with ICP-AES, it oﬀers the added potential for
measuring molybdenum during routine analysis of multiple nutrients (74).

13.4 MOLYBDENUM FERTILIZERS
Several molybdenum sources can be used to prevent or alleviate molybdenum deﬁciency in crop plants
(Table 13.4). These sources vary considerably in their solubility and in molybdenum content, and their
eﬀectiveness often depends primarily on the method of application, plant requirements, and on various
soil factors (87). The relative solubilities of some molybdenum fertilizers are as follows: sodium molyb-
date ⬎ ammonium molybdate ⬎ molybdic acid ⬎ molybdenum trioxide ⬎ molybdenum sulﬁde (114).
Molybdenum frits can also be used to supply Mo, but because of their limited solubility, they must be
ground ﬁnely to be eﬀective (89). Because of the low plant requirement for molybdenum and its mobil-
ity in plant tissues, several methods of molybdenum application are possible including soil application,
foliar fertilization, and seed treatment with various molybdenum sources.

13.4.1 METHODS OF APPLICATION

13.4.1.1 Soil Applications

Molybdenum fertilizers can be incorporated into the soil by banding or by broadcast applications.
Soluble  sources  of  molybdenum  such  as  sodium  molybdate  and  ammonium  molybdate  may  be
sprayed onto the soil surface before tilling to obtain a more uniform coverage, but this practice is
seldom used (89). Because the molybdenum requirement of plants is low, the quantities of molyb-
denum fertilizers needed for crop growth are less than for most other nutrients. Rates of 50 to 100 g
Mo ha⫺1 are generally required for soil treatments of agronomic crops, but as much as 400 g Mo
ha⫺1 may be needed for vegetable crops such as cauliﬂower (12). The uniform application of such
small quantities of molybdenum is often achieved by combining molybdenum with phosphorus fer-
tilizers or in mixed, complete (N-P-K) fertilizers, to increase the volume of applied material (89).

13.4.1.2 Foliar Fertilization

Sodium molybdate and ammonium molybdate are the most commonly used molybdenum sources
for foliar fertilization because of their high solubility in water. Foliar applications of molybdenum
are most eﬀective if applied at early stages of plant development, and generally a 0.025 to 0.1%
solution  of  sodium  or  ammonium  molybdate  (∼200 g  Mo  ha⫺1), is  recommended  (85).  Wetting
agents may also be required in the spray solution to ensure adequate coverage on the foliage of
crops  such  as  onion  and  cauliﬂower  (12).  Foliar  applications  of  molybdenum  are  often  more
eﬀective than soil applications, particularly for acid soils (9) or under dry conditions (115).

13.4.1.3 Seed Treatment

Seed pelleting, or coating, is the most common method for supplying molybdenum to crops (89)
and is an eﬀective means of preventing deﬁciency in crops grown on soils having low concentra-
tion of available molybdenum (9). This method ensures a more uniform application in the ﬁeld, and
the amounts of molybdenum that can be coated onto seeds are suﬃcient to provide adequate molyb-
denum for plant growth (89). Sparingly soluble sources of molybdenum, such as molybdenum tri-
oxide, are most often used to treat seeds of leguminous crops because soluble molybdenum sources
can decrease the eﬀectiveness of applied bacteria inoculum (85). Recommended rates for seed treat-
ment are 7 to 100 g Mo ha⫺1 (9,85), and higher rates (⬎117 g Mo ha⫺1) have been found to cause
toxic eﬀects in plants such as cauliﬂower (116).

13.4.2 CROP RESPONSE TO APPLIED MOLYBDENUM
The eﬀect of molybdenum fertilization on increasing plant yield is often related to an increased abil-
ity of the plant to utilize nitrogen. The activities of nitrogenase and nitrate reductase are aﬀected by
the molybdenum status of plants, and their activities are often suppressed in plants suﬀering from
molybdenum deﬁciency (22,117). Foliar application of molybdenum at 40 g ha⫺1 at 25 days after plant
emergence greatly enhanced nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activities of common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris L.), resulting in an increase in total nitrogen accumulation in shoots (117). In addition, foliar
fertilization of common bean with 40 g Mo ha⫺1 increased nodule size, but not the quantity of root
nodules  (118).  Therefore, the  main  eﬀect  of  molybdenum  on  nodulation  was  suggested  to  be  the
avoidance of nodule senescence, thus maintaining a longer period of eﬀective N2

ﬁxation.

The  application  of  molybdenum  to  soils  with  low  amounts  of  available  molybdenum  can
improve  crop  yield  dramatically, particularly  for  legumes, which  have  a  high  molybdenum
requirement (12). Large-seeded legumes often do not require molybdenum fertilization if their
seeds contain enough molybdenum to meet the requirements of the plant (119). But for plants
suﬀering from molybdenum deﬁciency, the response to molybdenum fertility often varies. The
lack of response to molybdenum can be related to other nutritional problems, such as the toxic
eﬀects of aluminum and manganese in acid soils, which mask the eﬀects of molybdenum nutri-
tion (116). In addition, molybdenum can be rendered unavailable to plants in acid soils if molyb-
denum is ﬁxed by iron and manganese oxides (120). Crop plants also vary in their requirement
for  molybdenum  (Table  13.1)  and  thus  require  diﬀerent  levels  of  molybdenum  fertilization  to
achieve maximum growth.

Soybean yields in southeastern United States have been shown to increase by 30 to 80% fol-
lowing  molybdenum  fertilization  on  acid  soils  (33,121).  Similar  results  have  been  obtained  for
peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) grown on acid soils in western Africa (122). However, Rhoades and
Nangju (123) found that at soil pH 4.5, soybeans did not respond to molybdenum. Diﬀerences in
the  response  of  legumes  to  molybdenum  may  be  related  to  the  timing  of  fertilizer  applications.
ﬁxation (between 10 and 21 days) (9), the
During the lag phase between infection and active N2
addition of molybdenum fertilizers may be ineﬀective because the growth response to added molyb-
denum is related primarily to the molybdenum requirements of the N2-ﬁxing bacteria (18). In other

CRC_DK2972_Ch013.qxd  6/6/2006  1:13 PM  Page 389

studies where molybdenum was seed-applied, cowpea (Vigna sinensis Endl.) yields increased by
25% (123), and oat (Avena sativa L.) yields increased by 48% (124). Molybdenum fertilization has
also been shown to increase the production of melons (Cucumis melo L.), with treated test plots
yielding 254 melons compared to 19 in the untreated plots (39).

The eﬃciency of molybdenum fertilizers can be aﬀected by soil pH. In acid soils, the avail-
ability of applied molybdenum can be limited due to the ﬁxation of MoO4
2⫺ by iron and aluminum
oxides, but the quantity of molybdenum in the soil solution increases with increasing soil pH (120).
Liming materials can be used in conjunction with molybdenum fertilization to increase molybde-
num uptake by plants, but the eﬀect on plant growth is limited to soil pH levels ⬍ 7.0 (48). Liming
alone may liberate enough soil-bound molybdenum to sustain plant growth (89). However the eﬀect
of lime depends on the total molybdenum content of soils. On acid soils where aluminum toxicity
can limit plant growth, adding both lime and molybdenum is often more beneﬁcial than adding only
one of them (125). Combined applications of lime and molybdenum to forage crops can lead to
problems for grazing animals because the accumulation of molybdenum in plant tissues can be high
enough to cause molybdenosis (126).

Other soil amendments such as phosphorus- or sulfur-containing fertilizers, may also inﬂuence
the  eﬃciency  of  molybdenum  fertilizers  by  aﬀecting  the  ﬁxation  of  molybdenum  in  soils  or  its
⫺), which has a high aﬃnity for iron oxides, can
uptake by plant roots. The use of phosphate (H2PO4
2⫺ con-
lead to the release of adsorbed molybdenum and to an increase in the water-soluble MoO4
centration  of  the  soil  (8). As  a  result, phosphorus  fertilization  often  increases  the  molybdenum
2⫺ are
absorption by roots and its accumulation in plant tissues (12,87). In contrast, sulfate and MoO4
strongly competitive during root absorption, and sulfur fertilization has been shown to decrease the
uptake of molybdenum by plants (127). Studies with peanut have shown that providing phosphorus
in the form of triple superphosphate is superior to single superphosphate for plants grown in molyb-
denum-deﬁcient soils (128). This diﬀerence was attributed to the sulfur component of single super-
phosphate and its eﬀect on inhibiting molybdenum uptake and suppressing plant growth.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
Nickel (Ni), the most recently discovered essential element (1), is unique among plant nutrients in
that its metabolic function was determined well before it was determined that its deﬁciency could
disrupt plant growth. Subsequent to the discovery of its essentiality in the laboratory, Ni deﬁciency
has now been observed in ﬁeld situations in several perennial species (2). The interest of plant sci-
entists in the role of nickel was initiated following the discovery in 1975 (3) that it was a critical
constituent of the plant enzyme, urease. The ultimate determination that nickel was essential for
plant growth (1) depended heavily on the development of new techniques to purify growth media
and to measure extremely low concentrations of nickel in plants. The establishment of nickel as an
essential  element, however, highlights  the  limitations  of  the  current  deﬁnition  of  essentiality  of
nutrients as applied to plants (4). It has been argued, for example, that even though nickel is clearly
a normal and functional constituent of plants, it does not fulﬁll the deﬁnition of essentiality, since
urease is not essential for plant growth and nickel deﬁciency apparently does not prevent the com-
pletion of the life cycle of all species, even though that criterion has not been explicitly satisﬁed for
any  element  (5).  Several  authors  (5,6)  now  suggest  that  the  criteria  for  essentiality  should  be
modiﬁed to include elements that are normal functional components of plants.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

As our ability to determine the molecular structure, function, and regulation of biological sys-
tems improves, it is quite likely that additional elements will be shown to have irreplaceable func-
tions in discrete biochemical processes that are important for plant life. This determination will be
supplemented by advances in molecular and structural biology that will help predict the occurrence
of similar processes across all organisms, allowing the relevance of discoveries made in bacterial
systems to be immediately tested in plant and animal systems. The discovery of the essentiality of
nickel is a good illustration of this principle and is likely to be repeated in the coming years. Nickel
represents the ﬁrst of several likely new essential elements that will be shown to be critical for cer-
tain metabolic processes normally active in plants, but not necessarily essential for the completion
of the species’ life cycle under all conditions.

The current deﬁnition of essentiality is clearly inadequate and its acceptance likely stiﬂes the
search  for  new  essential  elements.  It  is  proposed, therefore, that  the  deﬁnition  of  essentiality  be
modiﬁed to more closely resemble that utilized in animal biology (7).

An element shall be considered essential for plant life if a reduction in tissue concentrations of the ele-
ment below a certain limit results consistently and reproducibly in an impairment of physiologically
important functions and if restitution of the substance under otherwise identical conditions prevents the
impairment; and, the severity of the signs of deficiency increases in proportion to the reduction of expo-
sure to the substance. (Nielson (7))

By this criterion, nickel is an essential element as are silicon and cobalt, which are essential ele-

ments for nitrogen-ﬁxing plants.

14.2 DISCOVERY OF THE ESSENTIALITY OF NICKEL
The discovery in 1975 that nickel is a component of plant urease (3) prompted the  ﬁrst detailed
studies  on  the  essentiality  of  nickel  for  plant  life.  In  1977, Polacco  (8)  determined  that  tissue-
cultured soybean (Glycine max Merr.) cells could not grow in the absence of nickel when provided
with  urea  as  the  sole  nitrogen  source.  Subsequently, many  researchers  demonstrated  that  plant
growth is severely impacted by nickel deﬁciency when urea is the sole nitrogen source (9–14).

These  results, though  compelling, demonstrated  a  role  for  nickel  only  in  certain  species  when
grown with urea as the sole nitrogen source and as such did not satisfy the established criteria for essen-
tiality, which state that an element is essential if without the element, the plant cannot complete its life
cycle and the element is a constituent of an essential plant metabolite or molecule (4). Essentiality of
nickel was subsequently established in 1987, when Brown et al. (1) demonstrated that barley (Hordeum
vulgare L. cv. ‘Onda’) could not complete its life cycle in the absence of added nickel, even when plants
were supplied with a nonurea source of nitrogen. In addition, it was shown that growth of oats (Avena
sativa L. cv. ‘Astro’) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. ‘Era’) were signiﬁcantly depressed under
nickel-deﬁcient conditions (15). The laboratory-based observations that Ni deﬁciency impacts a diver-
sity of plant species has recently been veriﬁed in a diverse number of perennial species (Carya, Betula,
Pyracantha) growing in the acidic low-nutrient soils of southeastern United States (2).

Nickel  is  now  generally  accepted  as  an  essential  ultra-micronutrient  (16);  however, the  only
deﬁned role of nickel is in the metabolism of urea, a process that is not thought to be essential for
plants  supplied  with  a  nitrogen  source  other  than  urea.  The  possibility  that  additional  roles  for
nickel in plants exist was suggested by the results of Brown et al. (1,15), who demonstrated an eﬀect
of nickel deprivation in plants grown in the absence of urea and is implied in the work of Wood et al.
(2), who  demonstrated  ﬁeld  responses  to  Ni  supplementation  in  many  ureide-transporting
hydrophiles. A broader biological signiﬁcance of nickel is also implied in the demonstration that
nickel is essential for animal life and for a range of bacterial enzymes, including key enzymes in
the nitrogen-ﬁxing symbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum (17).

Our knowledge of the complete biological signiﬁcance of nickel for plant productivity is still
quite limited; however, with the demonstration of the essentiality of nickel in diverse species (1,2)

and the increased use of urea as a nitrogen source, the importance of understanding the chemistry
and biology of nickel and its potential impact on agricultural production has never been greater.
Evidence that nickel plays an important function in animal and bacterial systems also suggests that
nickel plays a larger role in plant productivity than is currently recognized. To obtain a full under-
standing of the potential role and management of nickel in agricultural systems, it is necessary to
review the roles of nickel in other biological systems and to understand the plant and soil conditions
under which nickel deﬁciency is likely to occur.

14.3 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF NICKEL AND 

ITS ROLE IN ANIMAL AND BACTERIAL SYSTEMS

Nickel is a ﬁrst-row transition metal with chemical and physical characteristics ideally suited to bio-
logical activity (18). Divalent nickel is the only oxidation state of nickel that is likely to be of any
importance to higher plants. Nevertheless, Ni2⫹ forms a bewildering array of complexes with a vari-
ety of coordination numbers and geometries (19). Nickel readily binds, complexes, and chelates a
number of substances of biological interest and is ubiquitous in all biological systems. Nickel is
now known to be a functional constituent of seven enzymes, six of which occur in bacterial and
animal systems, but not known to be active in plants, but the seventh enzyme, urease, is widely dis-
tributed in biology. The sensitivity of known biological nickel–complex equilibriums to tempera-
ture, concentration, and  pH  also  make  nickel  an  ideal  element  for  the  ﬁne  control  of  enzyme
reactions (18).

14.3.1 NICKEL-CONTAINING ENZYMES AND PROTEINS
The ﬁeld of nickel metallobiochemistry has seen tremendous growth over the preceding 10 years,
and nickel is clearly a biologically important element in a diverse range of organisms. Indeed, it is
highly  likely  that  with  the  advent  of  molecular  techniques  to  search  for  genetic  and  functional
homology rapidly, the diversity of known functions of nickel in biology will increase substantially
in the coming years. Advances in the ﬁeld of bacterial and animal biology will rapidly ﬂow to the
plant sciences.

To  date, seven  nickel-dependent  enzymes  have  been  identiﬁed.  Two  of  these  enzymes  have
nonredox function (urease and glyoxylase), and the remaining ﬁve involve oxidation–reduction reac-
tions (Ni-superoxide dismutase, methyl coenzyme M reductase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase,
acetyl coenzyme A synthase, and hydrogenase).

In all microorganisms that produce nickel-dependent metalloenzymes, there exist a number of
proteins involved in nickel uptake, transport storage, and incorporation into the metalloenzyme. In
bacteria, the transport of nickel into the cell involves two high-aﬃnity transport systems, an ATP-
dependent Nik family (Nik a–e) in Escherichia coli and a variety of nickel permeases (NixA, HoxN,
etc.) in diverse species (17). Incorporation of nickel into the metalloenzyme involves a number of
accessory proteins including metallo-chaperones (UreE, HypB, and CooJ) involved in nickel stor-
age and in protein assembly (17).

Of  the  established  nickel  enzymes  and  proteins, urease  is  the  sole  nickel-speciﬁc  enzyme
known to function in plants; however, nickel-dependent hydrogenase also indirectly inﬂuences plant
productivity through its role in nitrogen-ﬁxing symbionts (20) and in leaf commensal bacteria (21).
Currently, none of the bacterial proteins involved in nickel uptake and assimilation (NikA, NixA,
UreE, etc.) is known to be present in plants. Interestingly, the hydrogenase and urease activities of
leaf-surface symbionts are clearly inhibited when they colonize urease-deﬁcient soybean mutants
(21). The mechanism by which this inhibition occurs is unknown but may suggest that the urease-
deﬁcient mutants lack key nickel assimilatory proteins, thus preventing the transfer of nickel to the
leaf-surface  bacterial  enzymes.  This  possibility  would  suggest  that  plants  might  contain  nickel-
dependent assimilatory proteins.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Nielsen reported the ﬁrst description of a dietary deﬁciency of nickel in animals in 1970 for
chickens and later for rats (Rattus spp.), goats (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), cows (Bos taurus),
and  mini  pigs  (Sus  scrofa)  (7).  Nickel  deﬁciency  in  these  animals  results  in  growth  depression,
physiological and anatomical disruption of liver function, and disruption of iron, copper, and zinc
metabolism resulting in reduced levels of these enzymes in blood and various organs (22). Nickel
deﬁciency also markedly reduces the activity of a number of hepatic enzymes, including several
hydrogenases, urease, and glyoxylase, though a speciﬁc functional role for nickel in these enzymes
in animals has not been determined.

One  of  the  important  and  consistent  ﬁndings  from  animal  studies  is  that  nickel  deﬁciency
induces iron deﬁciency, an observation that is also made in plants (15). In rats (22), and in sheep
(23), nickel deprivation resulted in decreased iron uptake and reduced tissue-iron concentrations.
Nielsen et al. (24) have suggested several possible roles for nickel in iron metabolism and oxida-
tion–reduction (redox) shifts that draw upon the observation that nickel and iron are associated in a
number of bacterial redox-based enzymes (17).

The  suggestion  that  additional  nickel-dependent  enzymes  and  proteins  are  present  in  higher
plants is supported by the observation that several of the known bacterial nickel-containing enzymes
have analogs in plants and animals (including superoxide dismutase, glyoxylase, acetyl coenzyme
A synthase, and hydrogenase). Our current failure to identify additional nickel-dependent enzymes
in plants is likely a result of the relatively primitive state of plant enzymology, in contrast to bacte-
rial enzymology, and the diﬃculty involved in research on complex organisms involving ultra-trace
elements. The similarity between the eﬀects of nickel deﬁciency in animals and plants also provides
evidence of a common biological role for nickel in all organisms.

14.3.2 ESSENTIALITY AND FUNCTION OF NICKEL IN PLANTS
The ﬁrst evidence of a response of a ﬁeld crop to application of a nickel fertilizer was demonstrated in
1945 for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris
L.) crops (25). In these crops, the application of a dilute nickel spray resulted in a signiﬁcant increase
in yield. These experiments were conducted on the ‘Romney Marshes’ of England, a region that is well
known for its trace mineral deﬁciencies, particularly of manganese and zinc. These experiments were
conducted very carefully and excluded the possibility that the nickel applied was merely substituting
for manganese, zinc, iron, copper, or boron, suggesting that the growth response was indeed due to the
application of nickel. Interestingly, the soils of this region may be low in nickel since the conditions
that limit manganese and zinc availability in these soils (acid sands of low mineral content) would also
limit nickel availability to crops, and the concentrations of nickel provided were appropriate based on
the current knowledge of nickel demand. These same soil types also dominate the region of southeast
United States where Ni deﬁciency is now known to occur.

Mishra and Kar (26) and Welch (27) reviewed the evidence of the role of nickel in biological
systems and cited many examples of yield increases in ﬁeld-grown crops in response to the appli-
cation  of  nickel  to  the  crop  or  to  the  soil.  The  signiﬁcance  of  these  purported  beneﬁts  of  ﬁeld
applications of nickel is diﬃcult to interpret since the majority of the reported experiments used
very  high  nickel  application  rates.  None  of  these  reports  considered  the  possibility  that  nickel
inﬂuenced plant yield through its eﬀect on disease suppression, nor was the nickel concentration in
the crops determined. Indeed, prior to the availability of graphite-furnace atomic absorption spec-
trophotometers  and  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometers  (in  the  mid-1970s), it  was
exceedingly diﬃcult to measure nickel at the concentrations (⬍0.1 mg Ni kg⫺1 dry weight) later
shown to be critical for normal plant growth. In the absence of information on tissue-nickel con-
centrations, it is impossible to conclude that the observed yield increases were the result of a cor-
rection of a nickel deﬁciency in the plant.

Clear evidence that nickel application beneﬁted the growth of nitrogen-ﬁxing species of plant was
demonstrated by Bertrand and DeWolf (28), who reported that soil-nickel application to ﬁeld-grown

CRC_DK2972_Ch014.qxd  6/30/2006  3:31 PM  Page 399

Nickel

399

soybean (Glycine max Merr.) resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in nodule weight and seed yield. The
authors suggested that the yield increase was the result of a nickel requirement of the nitrogen-ﬁxing
rhizobia. A speciﬁc role for nickel in nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria is now well established with the deter-
mination that a nickel-dependent hydrogenase is active in many rhizobial bacteria (20) and is thus
essential for maximal nitrogen ﬁxation (29). Nickel is also known to be essential for nitrogen ﬁxation
of the free-living cyanobacterium, Nostoc muscorum C.A. Adargh, though the speciﬁc mechanism has
not been determined (30).

A  role  for  nickel  in  plant  disease  resistance  has  long  been  observed  and  has  been  variously
attributed to a direct phyto-sanitary eﬀect of nickel on pathogens, or to a role of nickel on plant dis-
ease-resistance mechanisms. Mishra and Kar (26) concluded that nickel likely acted to reduce plant
disease by direct toxicity to the pathogen. Nickel, however, is not particularly toxic when applied
directly to microorganisms, and Graham et al. (31) demonstrated that nickel supplied to the roots
of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp.) that contained only 0.03 mg Ni kg⫺1 dry weight eﬀectively
reduced leaf-fungal infection by 50%. Whether this eﬀect was directly due to a role of nickel in
plant defense reactions (possibly involving superoxide dismutase-mediated processes) or a conse-
quence of the alleviation of deﬁciency-induced changes in nitrogen metabolites (urea, amino acids,
etc.)  is  uncertain.  Regardless  of  the  mechanism, a  positive  eﬀect  of  nickel  supplementation  on
disease tolerance was clearly documented.

The discovery that nickel is a component of the plant urease in 1975 (3) prompted a renewed
interest in the role of nickel in plant life. In 1977, Polacco (32) determined that tissue-cultured soy-
bean cells could not grow in the absence of nickel when provided with urea as the sole nitrogen
source.  Subsequently, an  absolute  nickel  requirement  was  demonstrated  for  tissue-cultured  rice
(Oryza sativa L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) (26,27). This ﬁnding was followed in 1981
by a review of nickel in biology that suggested that leguminous plants might have a unique require-
ment for nickel (28).

Using a novel chelation chromatography technique to remove nickel as a contaminant from the
nutrient  media, Eskew  et  al.  (9,33,34)  and  Walker  et  al.  (11)  demonstrated  that, under  nickel-
deﬁcient conditions, urea accumulated to toxic levels in the leaves of soybean and cowpea. Leaﬂet
tips  of  nickel-deﬁcient  plants  contained  concentrations  of  urea  as  high  as  2.4%  dry  weight. The
accumulation of urea occurred irrespective of the nitrogen source used and was assumed to have
occurred as a result of urease-dependent disruption of the arginine-recycling pathway. Eskew et al.
(9)  concluded  that  nickel  was  an  essential  element  for  leguminous  plants  though  they  did  not
demonstrate a failure of nickel-deﬁcient plants to complete their life cycles. Recently, Gerendas et
al. (12–14), in a series of elegant studies demonstrated a profound eﬀect of nickel deﬁciency on the
growth of urea-fed tobacco, zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), rice, and canola (Brassica napus L.), but
observed no growth inhibition when nitrogen sources other than urea were used.

Conﬁrmation that nickel was essential for higher plants was provided by Brown et al. (1), who
demonstrated that barley seeds from nickel-deprived plants were incapable of germination even
when grown on a nitrogen source other than urea. Signiﬁcant restrictions in shoot growth of bar-
ley, oats, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were subsequently demonstrated under nickel-deﬁcient
conditions when the plants were supplied with mineral nitrogen sources (15). Brown et al. (15)
also  observed  a  marked  suppression  in  tissue-iron  concentrations  in  nickel-deﬁcient  plants, a
response that is also observed in nickel-deﬁcient animals (7). Reductions in tissue-malate concen-
trations have also been observed in nickel-deﬁcient animals and plants (15,24,35). Conﬁrmation
of  the  essentiality  of  Ni  under  ﬁeld  conditions  was  provided  in  2004  by Wood  et  al.  (2), who
observed  a  marked  and  speciﬁc  positive  response  to  application  of  Ni  fertilizer  to  pecan
(Carya illinoinensis K.  Koch)  and  other  species  (2)  that  could  not  be  corrected  with  any  other
known essential element.

The demonstration of a role for nickel in diverse plant species, the presence of nickel in a dis-
crete  metabolic  process, and  the  failure  of  plants  to  complete  their  life  cycles  in  the  absence  of
nickel, satisﬁes the requirement for the establishment of essentiality (4).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Although nickel has been accepted generally as an essential element, there is reason to be cau-
tious about this conclusion, and some authors suggest that nickel may not fully satisfy the most strin-
gent interpretation of the laws of essentiality primarily since its role in a speciﬁc essential metabolic
function has not been identiﬁed. Furthermore, even though nickel has a clear role in metabolism, it
is now clear that urease is not, by itself, essential for plant life as evidenced by the observation that
urease-null soybean mutants can complete their life cycles (37). There has also been no independent
replication of the eﬀect of nickel on barley grain viability though Horak (36) did observe a marked
increase in seed viability with the addition of nickel to pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds grown in nickel-
deﬁcient soils.

Regardless  of  these  apparent  contradictions, nickel  is  still  clearly  required  for  normal  plant
metabolism. As a component of urease, nickel is required for urea and arginine metabolism, and both
of these metabolites are normal constituents of plants (5). Nickel is also an essential component of
hydrogenases  involved  in  nitrogen  ﬁxation  and  other  associative  bacterial  processes, and  nickel
clearly inﬂuences plant response to disease. Nickel is clearly a normal constituent of plant life.

Many of the reported eﬀects of nickel on plant growth cannot be attributed solely to the role of
nickel in urease, and many symptoms of nickel deﬁciency (disrupted iron and malate metabolism) are
also observed in animals (7). It is likely, therefore, that additional nickel-dependent enzymes and pro-
teins await discovery and will help resolve the remaining questions on the function of nickel in plants.

14.3.3 INFLUENCE OF NICKEL ON CROP GROWTH
Many early reports of the role of nickel in agricultural productivity have been questioned since they
did not adequately exclude the possibility that nickel was acting directly as a fungicidal element
(27). Regardless of the many questionable reports, a compelling body of literature exists in which
appropriate concentrations of nickel were applied or where the plant response is consistent with cur-
rent knowledge of nickel functions including eﬀects on nitrogen ﬁxation, seed germination, and dis-
ease suppression (26,27,31,34,38,39).

The clearest agronomic responses to nickel have been observed when nitrogen is supplied as
urea or by nitrogen ﬁxation. The most illustrative example of the relationship between nickel and
urea metabolism is provided from studies with foliar urea application and tissue-culture growth of
plants. Plants without a supply of nickel have low urease activity in the leaves, and foliar applica-
tion of urea leads to a large accumulation of urea and severe necrosis of the leaf tips (34). Nicoulaud
and  Bloom  (40)  observed  that  nickel, provided  in  the  nutrient  solution  of  tomato  (Lycopersicon
esculentum Mill.)  seedlings  growing  with  foliar  urea  as  the  only  nitrogen  source, signiﬁcantly
enhanced growth. The authors speculated that the eﬀect of nickel was more consistent with its role
in urea translocation than that on urease activity directly (40). This result is in agreement with the
ﬁndings of Brown et al. (15), who suggest that nickel has a role in the transport of nitrogen to the
seed thereby inﬂuencing plant senescence and seed viability.

The ﬁrst demonstration of an agricultural Ni deﬁciency did not occur until 2004 (Wood et al.,
2004), when it was observed in pecan (Carya illinoinensis). Nickel deﬁciency in pecan is associ-
ated  with  a  physiological  disorder  ‘mouse-ear’ which  occurs  sporadically, but  with  increasing
frequency, throughout the southeastern United States (portions of South Atlantic region) where it
represents  a  substantial  economic  impact.  In  agreement  with  the  results  of  Brown  et  al.  (1),
Ni  deﬁciency  in  pecan  results  in  a  disruption  of  nitrogen  metabolism  and  altered  amino  acid 
proﬁles (72).

The value of addition of nickel to Murashige and Skoog plant tissue-culture medium was shown
by Witte et al. (41). These authors suggested that the lack of nickel and urease activity may repre-
sent a stress factor in tissue culture and recommended that the addition of 100 nM Ni be adopted as
a standard practice. The beneﬁts of adding nickel to solution cultures was also demonstrated by
Khan  et  al.  (42), who  determined  that  a  mixture  of  0.05 mg  Ni  L⫺1 and  20%  nitrogen  as  urea
resulted in optimal growth of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) under hydroponic conditions.

14.4 DIAGNOSIS OF NICKEL STATUS

14.4.1 SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIENCY AND TOXICITY
In legumes and other dicotyledonous plants, nickel deﬁciency results in decreased activity of urease and
subsequently in urea toxicity, exhibited as leaﬂet tip necrosis (9–11). With nitrogen-ﬁxing plants or with
plants grown on nitrate and ammonium, nickel deﬁciency results in a general suppression in plant growth
with development of leaf tip necrosis on typically pale green leaves (9,10) (Figure 14.1 and Figure 14.2).
These symptoms were attributed to the accumulation of toxic levels of urea in the leaf tissues.

In graminaceous species (Figure 14.3), deﬁciency symptoms include chlorosis similar to that
induced by iron deﬁciency (1), including interveinal chlorosis and patchy necrosis in the youngest
leaves. Nickel deﬁciency also results in a marked enhancement in plant senescence and a reduction
in tissue-iron concentrations. In monocotyledons and in dicotyledons, the accumulation of urea in
leaf tips is diagnostic of nickel deﬁciency. In early or incipient stages of nickel toxicity, no clearly
visible symptoms develop, though shoot and root growth may be suppressed. Acute nickel toxicity
results  in  symptoms  that  have  variously  been  likened  to  iron  deﬁciency  (interveinal  chlorosis  in

the leaf margins, followed by plant death.

to nickel deﬁciency that can be cured by application of nickel (at 100 mg L⫺1) (2). Nickel deﬁciency
in pecan and in certain other woody perennial crops (e.g., plum, peach and pyracantha, and citrus)
is characterized by

early-season leaf chlorosis, dwarfing of foliage, blunting of leaf or leaflet tips, necrosis of leaf or leaflet
tips, curled leaf or leaflet margins, dwarfed internodes, distorted bud shape, brittle shoots, cold-injury-
like death of over-wintering shoots, diminished root system with dead fibrous roots, failure of foliar lam-
ina to develop, rosetting and loss of apical dominance, dwarfed trees, and tree death (Wood et al. (2))

Nickel  deﬁciency  was  long  unrecognized  in  this  region  because  of  its  similarity  to  zinc
deﬁciency and as a consequence of a complex set of factors that inﬂuences its occurrence. Nickel
deﬁciency is induced by: (a) excessively high soil zinc, copper, manganese, iron, calcium, or mag-
nesium; (b) root damage by root-knot nematodes; or (c) dry or cool soils at the time of bud break
(2). The conditions under which Ni deﬁciency occurs also commonly result in a deﬁciency of zinc
or copper, and this fact has resulted in the extensive use of copper and zinc fertilizers over many
years further exacerbating the nickel deﬁciency. In many horticultural tree species, heavy applica-
tion of fertilizers with zinc, copper, or both nutrients is common for their nutritional values and
beneﬁts for leaf removal and disease protection. In many orchard crops recalcitrant physiological
disorders  and  poorly  understood  replant  ‘diseases’ are  frequent  suggesting  that  induced  nickel
deﬁciency may be much more widespread than was previously recognized.

14.5 CONCENTRATION OF NICKEL IN PLANTS
The nickel concentration (Table 14.1) in leaves of plants grown on uncontaminated soil ranges from
0.05 to 5.0 mg Ni kg⫺1 dry weight (27,44,45). The adequate range for nickel appears to fall between
0.01 and 10 mg Ni kg⫺1 dry weight, which is an extremely wide range compared to that for the other
elements (5). The critical nickel concentration required for seed germination in barley, shoot growth
in oat, barley, and wheat, and shoot growth of urea-fed tomato, rice, and zucchini (Cucumus pepo
var. melopepo Alef.) has been estimated independently by two groups to be approximately 100 mg
Ni kg⫺1 (1,5), which is similar to the recently determined Ni requirement for pecan (2).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Nickel concentrations above the toxicity levels of ⬎10 mg kg⫺1 dry weight in sensitive species,
and  ⬎50 mg kg⫺1 dry weight in moderately tolerant ones (44,45,46) result in impaired root and
shoot growth without any remarkable deﬁning characteristics (47).

The nickel content of a plant is determined by the nickel availability in the soil, plant species,
plant part, and season. Plants growing on serpentine soils (derived from ultramiﬁc rocks) or con-
taminated soils can accumulate high levels of nickel and other heavy metals (48,49). In naturally
occurring high-nickel soils (serpentine soils) highly specialized plant species have evolved includ-
ing  several  species  that  hyperaccumulate  nickel, sometimes  up  to  1  to  5%  of  tissue  dry  weight
(50,51). Species growing on the same soil can also vary dramatically in nickel content and within
plant distribution. In general, nickel is transported preferentially to the grain, particularly under con-
ditions of marginal nickel supply (52).

14.6 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT
In  bacterial  systems, several  families  of  nickel  permeases  and ATP-dependent  nickel  carriers  have
been characterized. No equivalent mechanism has yet been identiﬁed in animals or plants (17). In
plant systems, most studies have been conducted at unrealistically high soil-nickel concentrations and
as such may be relevant for nickel toxicity, but are not relevant for nickel uptake under normal condi-
tions. Cataldo et al. (56) using 63Ni indicated that a high-aﬃnity Ni2⫹ carrier functioned at 0.075 or
0.25 µM Ni2⫹ with a Km of 0.5 µM which approaches the nickel concentration in uncontaminated soils
(48). Either Cu2⫹ or Zn2⫹ competitively inhibits Ni2⫹ uptake suggesting that all the three elements
share a common uptake system (57). Uptake at higher nickel-supply levels (0.5 to 30 µM) was energy
dependent and had a Km of 12 µM indicative of an active, low-aﬃnity transport system.

No  evidence  suggests  that  associations  with  arbuscular  mycorrhizal  fungus  increase  nickel

accumulation by plants (58,59).

Nickel, unlike many other divalent cations, is readily re-translocated within the plant likely as
a complex with organic acids and amino acids (60). Nickel rapidly re-translocates from leaves to
young tissues in the phloem, particularly during reproductive growth. Indeed, up to 70% of nickel
in  the  shoots  was  transported  to  the  seed  of  soybean  (61).  Nickel  is  associated  primarily  with
organic acids and amino acids in the phloem. Above pH 6.5, histidine is the most signiﬁcant chela-
tor, whereas at pH ⬍5, citrate is the most signiﬁcant one (5).

14.7 NICKEL IN SOILS

14.7.1 NICKEL CONCENTRATION IN SOILS
Nickel is abundant in the crust of the Earth, comprising about 3% of the composition of the earth.
Nickel averages 50 mg Ni kg⫺1 in soils and commonly varies from 5 to 500 mg Ni kg⫺1 but ranges
up to 24,000 to 53,000 mg Ni kg⫺1 in soil near metal reﬁneries or in dried sewage sludge, respec-
tively. Agricultural soils typically contain 3 to 1000 mg Ni kg⫺1, whereas soils derived from basic
igneous rocks may contain from 2000 to 6000 mg Ni kg⫺1 (62).

Total nickel content is, however, not a good measure of nickel availability. At pH⬎6.7, most of
the nickel exists as sparingly soluble hydroxides, whereas at pH⬍6.5, most nickel compounds are
relatively soluble (48). Depending on the soil type and pH, nickel may also be highly mobile in soil
and is further mobilized by acid rain. The role of pH in nickel availability was illustrated by Van de
Graaﬀ et  al.  (63), who  observed  that  long-term  irrigation  with  sewage  eﬄuent  increased  heavy
metal  loading  in  soil, but  that  plant  metal  contents  did  not  increase, apparently  owing  to  the
increased soil pH, iron complexation and coprecipitation, and precipitation of phosphorus–metal
complexes.

Truly nickel-deﬁcient soils have not been identiﬁed to date; however, Ni deﬁciency can occur as
a result of excessive use of competing ions (Zn, Cu, and MgO and unfavorable growth conditions (2)).

Nickel

405

Nickel  is  the  24th-most  abundant  element  in  the  crust  of  the  earth, and  plant  nickel  requirement
(⬍0.05 mg kg⫺1 dry weight) is the lowest of any essential element. Although a large number of analy-
ses have been conducted for nickel in plant tissues, no recorded levels have been below 0.2 mg kg⫺1
dry weight in ﬁeld-grown plants. Nickel can be supplied by atmospheric deposition, at rates that eas-
ily exceed the removal from the crops in the ﬁeld (64). The ubiquitous nature of nickel is illustrated
by the experiments that established the essentiality of nickel (1). In these experiments, the authors
went to extraordinary lengths to purify or re-purify all chemical reagents, equipment, and water and
to maintain contaminant-free growing conditions. Even under these conditions, it required three gen-
erations of crop growth to deplete the nickel carried over from the grain before the ﬁrst evidence of
nickel deﬁciency was observed.

The possibility that nickel-deﬁcient soils exist, however, cannot be discounted particularly as
purity of fertilizers is improved, the use of urea is increased, and atmospheric deposition of pollu-
tant nickel is decreased. Plants grown under specialized conditions (greenhouses and tissue culture),
particularly with urea as a nitrogen source, may be especially susceptible to nickel deﬁciency (40).
Nickel toxicity, which is usually associated with serpentine soils, sewage-sludge application, or
industrial pollution, is a well-described constraint on crop production in many parts of the world.
In serpentine soils (derived from basic igneous rocks), nickel concentrations may range from 1000
to 6000 mg kg⫺1 dry weight and are frequently associated with high concentrations of iron, zinc,
and chromium and an unfavorable ratio of magnesium to calcium. Values for ammonium acetate-
extractable nickel in these soils varies from 3 to 70 mg kg⫺1; however, it is not always clear that
poor plant growth can be ascribed to any single factor concerning nickel.

Similarly, in  sewage-amended  soils  or  in  contaminated  soils, it  is  often  diﬃcult  to  relate  total
nickel load with plant productivity as factors such as the chemical properties of the contaminant and
base soil, pH, and oxidation–reduction state aﬀect results (48,65). Indeed, the importance of consid-
ering soil pH is well illustrated by Kukier and Chaney (65 and references therein), who demonstrated
that addition of limestone to raise soil pH is highly eﬀective in immobilizing nickel in situ and in
reducing phytotoxicity. Plant species also diﬀer in their ability to obtain nickel from soils and hence
any measurement of soil nickel must be interpreted with consideration of the plant species of interest.

14.7.2 NICKEL ANALYSIS IN SOILS
A large number of approaches, including diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), BaCl2, Sr(NO3)2,
and ammonium acetate among others (48,65) are used to extract metals from soils in an attempt to
predict nickel availability to plants. The DTPA method, however, is probably the most commonly
used (48,66,67) and has been shown to be quite eﬀective for a variety of soils to deﬁne Ni excess.
The DTPA method is improved signiﬁcantly if factors such as soil pH and soil bulk density are
incorporated into the resulting regression equation (65). Many authors (48,65), however, observe
that  plant  species  and  soil  environment  (water, oxygen  content, and  temperature)  can  markedly
aﬀect the relationship between soil-extractable and plant-nickel concentrations (2). These results
suggest that the condition under which the soil is collected and tested can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
interpretation of results. Nickel deﬁciency is also known to be exacerbated by environmental con-
ditions that limit uptake (cold, wet weather) and by the oversupply of apparently competing ele-
ments such as Cu, Mn, Mg, Fe, Ca, and Zn (2). Nickel bioavailability can also be determined by the
ion-exchange resin (IER) method, which has been used quite successfully in a limited number of
soil types and facilitates the in situ assessment of exchangeable nickel (68).

14.8 NICKEL FERTILIZERS
Essentially under all normal ﬁeld conditions, it is unlikely that application of nickel fertilizer will
be required. Exceptions to this concept occur when urea is the primary source of nitrogen supply,
in species in which ureides play an important physiological role (2), when excessive applications of

CRC_DK2972_Ch014.qxd  6/30/2006  3:31 PM  Page 406

406

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ca, or Mg have been made over many years (2) and perhaps also in nitrogen-ﬁxing
crops grown on mineral-poor or highly nickel-ﬁxing (high pH, high lime) soils. In experiments uti-
lizing highly puriﬁed nutrient solutions or tissue-culture media, supplemental nickel may also be
beneﬁcial.  In  all  of  these  cases, the  nickel  demand  is  quite  low  and  can  be  satisﬁed  easily  with
NiSO4 or  other  soluble  nickel  sources  including  Ni–organic  complexes  (Bruce  Wood, personal
communication). In solution-grown plants and as a supplement to foliar urea applications, a nickel
supply of 0.5 to 1 µM is suﬃcient.

Nickel is currently being applied to many ﬁelds in sewage sludge (48,69). In general, this usage
does not represent a threat to human health, as its availability to crop plants is typically low. The
total extractable nickel in these amended soils can also be controlled by selection of plant species
and management of soil pH, moisture, and organic matter (65).

In recent years, a great deal of attention is being focused on nickel-accumulating plants that can
tolerate otherwise nickel-toxic soils and accumulate substantial concentrations of nickel, up to 5%
on a dry weight basis (70). Three nickel hyperaccumulators showed signiﬁcantly increased shoot
biomass with the addition of 500 mg Ni kg⫺1 to a nutrient-rich growth medium, suggesting that the
nickel hyperaccumulators have a higher requirement for nickel than other plants (71). Considerable
attention is also being focused on utilizing hyperaccumulating species for phytoremediation and
phytomining, where  they  can  be  grown  in  a  nickel-contaminated  soil  and  then  harvested  and
exported from the ﬁeld. To date, however, this approach has not been successful owing to the small
size and slow growth rate of many of the hyperaccumulating species. With a better understanding
of the genetic basis of metal hyperaccumulation, it may be possible to transfer this trait into a fast-
growing agronomic species and hence develop an eﬀective phyoremediation strategy.

14.9 CONCLUSION
Nickel is the latest element to be classiﬁed as essential for plant growth in both laboratory and ﬁeld
conditions  and  an  absolute  requirement  for  nickel  fertilizer  under  ﬁeld  conditions  in  perennial
species growing in the southeast of the United States has now been established. Nickel clearly has
a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the productivity of ﬁeld-grown, nitrogen-ﬁxing plants, those in which ureides
are a signiﬁcant form of nitrogen and those utilizing urea as a primary nitrogen source. The symp-
toms of nickel deﬁciency in barley, wheat, and oats observed by Brown et al. (1) and Wood et al.
(2) are consistent with the observations made in nickel-deﬁcient animals and are indicative of a role
of nickel in nitrogen metabolism that cannot be easily explained through an exclusive role of nickel
in urease. This ﬁnding in combination with the diverse known functions of nickel in bacteria sug-
gests that nickel may indeed play a role in many, yet undiscovered processes in plants.

15.1 INTRODUCTION

15.1.1 EARLY RESEARCH ON ZINC NUTRITION OF CROPS
Discovery of zinc as an essential element for higher plants was made by Sommer and Lipman (1)
while working with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.). However,
Chandler et al. (2) stated that Raulin, as early as 1869, reported zinc to be essential in the culture
media for some fungi, and speculated that zinc was probably essential in higher plants. Skinner and
Demaree (3) reported on a typical Dougherty county pecan (Carya illinoinensis K. Koch) orchard
in Georgia. Pecan trees that were placed in a study that started in 1918 increased in trunk diameter,
but their tops had dieback each year, and their condition ‘appeared hopeless’ in 1922. Fertilizers (N,
P, K), cover crops, and all known means were of no avail. Rosette, or related dieback, had been rec-
ognized since around 1900, but it was in 1932 before zinc was found to be the corrective element
(4,5). The common assumption among pecan growers was that a deﬁciency of iron was responsible
for rosette as pecans were brought into cultivation in the early 1900s. Alben used 0.8 to 1.0% solu-
tions of FeCl2 and FeSO4 in his rosette treatments in 1931 and obtained conﬂicting results. The
1932 treatments included injections into dormant trees, soil applications while the trees were dor-
mant and after the foliage was well developed, and foliar spraying and dipping. The only favorable
results were obtained when Alben mixed the iron solutions in zinc-galvanized containers. Analysis
proved that the solutions contained considerable quantities of zinc. These experiments led to the use

411

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

of ZnSO4 and ZnCl2 solutions, which permitted normal development of new leaves. Satisfactory
results were obtained with trees located on alkaline or acid soils. The most satisfactory results were
obtained with a foliar spray of 0.18% ZnSO4 and a 0.012% ZnCl2 solution. Roberts and Dunegan
(6) also observed a bactericidal eﬀect when using a ZnSO4-hydrated lime mixture that controlled
bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas pruni), which later became a serious pest for susceptible peach
(Prunus persica Batsch.) cultivars like ‘Burbank July Elberta’ in the 1940s, ‘Sam Houston’ in the
1960s, and ‘O-Henry’ in the 1990s (personal experience). Hydrated lime was necessary to prevent
defoliation of peach trees by ZnSO4 toxicity.

15.2 ABSORPTION AND FUNCTION OF ZINC IN PLANTS
Zinc is taken up predominantly as a divalent cation (Zn2⫹), but at high pH it is probably absorbed as
a monovalent cation (ZnOH⫹) (7). Zinc is either bound to organic acids during long distance trans-
port in the xylem or may move as free divalent cations. Zinc concentrations are fairly high in phloem
sap where it is probably complexed to low-molecular-weight organic solutes (8). The metabolic func-
tions of zinc are based on its strong tendency to form tetrahedral complexes with N-, O-, and partic-
ularly S-ligands, and thus it plays a catalytic and structural role in enzyme reactions (9).

Zinc is an integral component of enzyme structures and has the following three functions: cat-
alytic, coactive, or structural (9,10). The zinc atom is coordinated to four ligands in enzymes with
catalytic functions. Three of them are amino acids, with histidine being the most frequent, fol-
lowed by glutamine and asparagine. A water molecule is the fourth ligand at all catalytical sites.
The structural zinc atoms are coordinated to the S-groups of four cysteine residues forming a ter-
tiary structure of high stability. These structural enzymes include alcohol dehydrogenase, and the
proteins involved in DNA replication and gene expression (11). Alcohol dehyrogenase contains
two zinc atoms per molecule, one with catalytic reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol and the other
with structural functions. Ethanol formation primarily occurs in meristematic tissues under aero-
bic conditions in higher plants. Alcohol dehyrdrogenase activity decreases in zinc-deﬁcient plants,
but the consequences are not known (7). Flooding stimulates the alcohol dehydrogenase twice as
much in zinc-suﬃcient compared with zinc-deﬁcient plants, which could reduce functions in sub-
merged rice (12).

Carbonic  anhydrase  (CA)  contains  one  zinc  atom, which  catalyzes  the  hydration  of  carbon
dioxide (CO2). The enzyme is located in the chloroplasts and the cytoplasm. Carbon dioxide is the
substrate  for  photosynthesis  in  C3 plants, but  no  direct  relationship  was  reported  between  CA
activity and photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in C3 plants (13). The CA activity is absent when zinc
is extremely low, but when even a small amount of zinc is present, maximum net photosynthesis
can occur. Photosynthesis by C4 metabolism is considerably diﬀerent (14,15) than that occurring
in C3 plants. For C4 metabolism, a high CA activity is necessary to shift the equilibrium in favor
⫺ for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which forms malate for the shuttle into the bun-
of HCO3
dle sheath chloroplasts, where CO2 is released and serves as substrate of ribulosebisphosphate car-
boxylase.

15.3 ZINC DEFICIENCY
Zinc  deﬁciency  is  common  in  plants  growing  in  highly  weathered  acid  or  calcareous  soils  (16).
Roots of zinc-deﬁcient trees often exude a gummy material. Major zinc-deﬁcient sites are old barn-
yards or corral sites, where an extra heavy manure application accumulated over the years. Zinc
ions become tied to organic matter to the extent that zinc is not available to the roots of peach trees
(17,18). Zinc deﬁciency initially appears in all plants as intervenial chlorosis (mottling) in which
lighter green to pale yellow color appears between the midrib and secondary veins (Figure 15.1 and
Figure  15.2)  Developing  leaves  are  smaller  than  normal, and  the  internodes  are  short.  Popular
names describe these conditions as ‘little leaf’ and ‘rosette’ (19,20). Pecan trees in particular suﬀer

FIGURE 15.1 Zinc deﬁciency of peaches (Prunus persica Batsch) is expressed as developing leaves that are
smaller than normal and the internodes are shorter causing leaves to be closer to each other and thence the pop-
ular names which describes the terminal branches as ‘little leaf’. (Photograph by J.B. Storey.) (For a color pres-
entation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

FIGURE 15.2 Zinc-deﬁcient pecan (Carya illinoinensis K. Koch) leaves (left) can contain less than 30 mg
Zn per kg compared to over 80 mg Zn per kg Zn in healthy leaves (right). The zinc-deﬁcient leaves have small
crinkled leaves that are mottled with yellow. Healthy zinc-suﬃcient leaves are dark green. Actual zinc con-
centration of each leaf is shown in the photograph. (Photograph by J.B. Storey.) (For a color presentation of
this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

FIGURE 15.3 Zinc-deﬁcient pecan (Carya illinoinensis K. Koch) trees have shorter internodes so that the
leaves are closer together forming a rosette of poorly formed crinkled, chlorotic leaves. (Photograph by J.B.
Storey.) (For a color presentation of this figure, see the accompanying compact disc.)

lowed  by  death  of  the  entire  tree.  Dieback  can  occur  on  young  or  old  trees.  (Photograph  by  J.B.  Storey.)

from shortened internodes (rosette) (Figure 15.3). Shoot apices die (shoot die-back) under severe
zinc deﬁciency, as in a tree in Comanche county, Texas (Figure 15.4). Forest plantations in Australia
have shown similar symptoms (21). Citrus often show diﬀusive symptoms (mottle leaf) (Figure 15.5).
The ideal time to demonstrate citrus trace element deﬁciency symptoms is in winter months when the

soil is relatively cold. Treatment with zinc fertilizers is not necessary if the symptoms disappear when
the soil temperature rises in the spring. Sorghum  (Sorghum bicolor Moench) that is deﬁcient in zinc
forms chlorotic bands along the midrib and red spots on the leaves (22). Shoots are more inhibited
by zinc deﬁciency than roots (23). For most plants, the critical leaf zinc deﬁciency levels range from
10 to 100 mg kg⫺1 depending on species (Table 15.1).

15.4 ZINC TOLERANCE
Zinc is the heavy metal most often in the highest concentrations in wastes arising in industrialized
communities (21). Zinc exclusion from uptake, or binding in the cell walls, does not seem to con-
tribute to zinc tolerance (24,25). Zinc exclusion might exist in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), where
certain ectomycorrhizal fungi retain most of the zinc in their mycelia, resulting in the ability of the
plant to tolerate zinc (26). Infections with ectomycorrhizal fungi are beneﬁcial for the growth and
development of pecan (27). These fungi are highly specialized parasites that do not cause root disease.
They are symbiotic, thus gaining substance from the root and contributing to the health of the root.

Tolerance is achieved through sequestering zinc in the vacuoles, and zinc remains low in the
cytoplasm of tolerant plants, whereas zinc is stored in the cytoplasm of non-tolerant clones (28).
Positive correlation between organic acids such as citrate and malate with zinc in tolerant plants
indicates a mechanism of zinc tolerance (29,30). Zinc tolerance in tufted hair grass (Deschampsia
caespitosa Beauvois) was increased in plants supplied with ammonium as compared to nitrate nutri-
tion. This eﬀect apparently is caused by greater accumulation of asparagine in the cytoplasm of
ammonium-fed plants, which form stable complexes with asparagines and zinc (31).

Foliar application of chelates is ineﬃcient because of poor absorption of the large organic mol-
ecules through cuticles (32,33). Foliar ZnSO4 treatments are toxic to peach leaves (34) and to many
other species, probably because sulfur accumulates on leaves and results in salt burn. A zinc nitrate-
ammonium  nitrate-urea  fertilizer  (NZNTM;  15%  N, 5%  Zn; Tessenderlo  Kerley  Group, Phoenix,
AZ, U.S.A.) did not burn peach leaves. Apparently, NZN-treated peach leaves do not suﬀer from
salt burn because the nitrate in NZN is readily absorbed in response to the need of leaves for nitro-
gen in protein synthesis thus not accumulating on the surface to cause leaf burn (34).

15.5 TRUNK INJECTION
Experience with trunk injections of zinc has been disappointing in all cases despite rumors of suc-
cess. It would seem logical that placement of any form of zinc in the secondary xylem of an actively
transpiring tree would utilize the xylem vessels to rapidly transport the zinc to the actively growing
meristems.  However, many  researchers  including  Millikan  and  Hanger  (35,36)  have  proven  that
zinc transport is more complex than injecting zinc in any form into tree trunks. Millikan and Hanger
(36) reported that 65Zn moved from the injection point only when zinc was injected into the bark of
2-year-old  apple  trees.  Supplying  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA)  enhanced  65Zn  move-
ment in an acropetal (upward) direction only. The 65Zn was distributed to spurs and laterals on the
distal side of the injection point. Millikan and Hanger (36) also reported that 65Zn accumulated at
the nodes on lateral branches and in the petioles, midrib, and major veins of the leaves. Wadsworth
(37) reported no signiﬁcant eﬀect of ZnEDTA applied via injection into the secondary xylem of
mature ‘Western’ or ‘Burkett’ pecan tree leaves on nut quality or yield. He suggested that the vol-
ume of zinc was inadequate to inﬂuence such a large tree. The possibility of home owners using this
means of applying zinc to their large pecan landscape trees, which would otherwise require large
spray machines, was discounted by the danger of small children pulling them out of the trunks and
inserting them in their mouths. The direct application of zinc chelates to the secondary xylem via
injection was unsuccessful primarily because of the small volume of zinc injected (37).

15.6 ZINC IN SOILS
Zinc has a complete 3d104s2 outer electronic conﬁguration and, unlike the other d block micronu-
trients such as such as manganese, molybdenum, copper, and iron, has only a single oxidation state
and hence a single valence of II. The average concentration of zinc in the crust of the Earth, granitic,
and basaltic igneous rock is approximately 70, 40, and 100 mg kg⫺1, respectively (38), whereas sed-
imentary rocks like limestone, sandstone, and shale contain 20, 16, and 95 mg kg⫺1, respectively
(39). The  total  zinc  content  in  soils  varies  from  3  to  770 mg  kg⫺1 with  the  world  average  being
64 mg kg⫺1 (40).

There are ﬁve major pools of zinc in the soil: (a) zinc in soil solution; (b) surface adsorbed and
exchangeable zinc; (c) zinc associated with organic matter; (d) zinc associated with oxides and car-
bonates; and (e) zinc in primary minerals and secondary alumino-silicate materials (41).

There  is  evidence  that  Zn2⫹ activities  in  the  soil  solution  may  be  controlled  by  franklinite
(ZnFe2O4), whose equilibrium solubility is similar to that of soil-held zinc over pH values of 6 to 9
(42,43). The mineral will precipitate whenever zinc concentration in the soil solution exceeds the
equilibrium solubility of the mineral and will dissolve whenever the opposite is true. This process
provides a zinc-buﬀering system.

Zinc may be associated with soil organic matter, which includes water-soluble and organic com-
pounds. Zinc is bound via incorporation into organic molecules, exchange, chelation, or by speciﬁc
and nonspeciﬁc adsorption (41).

Zinc is associated with hydrous oxides and carbonates via adsorption, surface complex forma-
tions, ion exchange, incorporation into the crystal lattice, and co-precipitation (41). Some of these
reactions ﬁx zinc rather strongly and are believed to be instrumental in controlling the amount of
zinc in the soil solution (44). Zinc is complexed with CaCO3 in alkaline (pH 8.2) soils in the west-
ern half of Texas where most of the pecans are grown in the state (45–47). Soil-incorporated ZnSO4
at 91 kg per pecan tree did not bring the zinc content of the soils to an adequate level because the
zinc was transferred from the sulfate form to sparingly soluble ZnCO3 (48).

Five rates of ZnSO4 and three rates of S were supplied to pecan trees in March 1966 in a single
application  to  soil  (deep  Tivoli  sand, pH  8.2;  mixed  thermic, Typic  ustipamments)  in  Dawson
county, Texas (south plains) (49). In the absence of applied sulfur, adding of ZnSO4 in excess of
20 kg per tree was required to raise zinc concentrations in leaﬂets in June or September 1966 above

CRC_DK2972_Ch015.qxd  7/1/2006  7:36 AM  Page 423

the minimum optimum of 60 mg kg⫺1. Additions of sulfur reduced the amount of ZnSO4 required
to reach 60 mg kg⫺1 to 18.8 kg per tree with 4.5 kg S per tree and to 16.2 kg per tree with 11.9 kg S
per tree. Leaﬂets collected in September 1967 contained more than 60 mg Zn kg⫺1 if ZnSO4 was
applied in March 1966 at rates greater than 4.8 kg per tree. However, in 1967, at any given rate of
ZnSO4 (above 1.4 kg per tree), leaﬂet zinc concentration was reduced by the addition of sulfur, but
the concentrations of zinc in the leaﬂets remained above the minimum optimum level. This study
indicates that leaﬂet zinc of pecan trees in calcareous soils can be increased by soil applications of
ZnSO4, but that a larger increase will occur if S is applied with ZnSO4. On the other hand, soil appli-
cations seemed impractical considering the fact that with a planting of 86 trees per ha, an applica-
tion of 120 kg of ZnSO4 ha⫺1 would be required. In acid soils of the southeastern United States, high
rates of soil-applied zinc may be responsible for the elusive mouse-ear symptom in the acid soils of
the  southeastern  United  States  (50).  These  results  agree  with  Sommers  and  Lindsay  (51), who
reported that in soils with high concentrations of heavy metals, nickel will compete with zinc for
chelation in acid soils and that cadmium and lead will do the same in alkaline soils.

15.7 PHOSPHORUS–ZINC INTERACTIONS
The higher phosphorus content in zinc-deﬁcient plants supplied with high phosphorus can to some
degree be attributed to a concentration eﬀect (52). However, the main reason for the high concen-
tration in the leaves is that zinc deﬁciency enhances the uptake rate of phosphorus by the roots and
translocation to the shoots (53). This enhancement eﬀect is speciﬁc for zinc deﬁciency and is not
observed  when  other  micronutrients  are  deﬁcient.  Enhanced  phosphorus  uptake  in  zinc-deﬁcient
plants can be part of an expression of higher passive permeability of the plasma membranes of root
cells  or  impaired  control  of  xylem  loading.  Zinc-deﬁcient  plants  also  have  a  high  phosphorus
content because the retranslocation of phosphorus is impaired.

15.8 TRYPTOPHAN AND INDOLE ACETIC ACID SYNTHESIS
The  most  distinct  zinc  deﬁciency  symptoms  are  ‘little  leaf’ and  ‘rosette’ in  pecans  and  peaches
(Figure 15.1 and Figure 15.2). These symptoms have long been considered to represent problems
in indole acetic acid (IAA, auxin) metabolism. However, the mode of action of zinc in auxin metab-
olism is unidentiﬁed. Retarded stem elongation in zinc-deﬁcient tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
Mill.) plants was correlated with a decrease in IAA level, but resumption of stem elongation and
IAA content occur after zinc is resupplied. Increased IAA levels preceded elongation growth upon
resupply of zinc (54), which would be expected if growth was a response of increased supply of
auxin caused by application of zinc. Low levels of IAA in zinc-deﬁcient plants are probably the
results of inhibited synthesis of IAA (55). There is an increase in tryptophan content in the dry mat-
ter of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains by zinc fertilization of plants grown in calcareous soil (56). The
lower IAA content in zinc-deﬁcient leaves may be due to the biosynthesis of IAA tryptophan (57).
Lower IAA contents may be the result of enhanced oxidative degradation of IAA caused by super-
oxide generation enhanced under conditions of zinc deﬁciency (55).

15.9 ROOT UPTAKE
Zinc absorbed by pecan seedlings was translocated predominately to the youngest, physiologically
active  tissue, in  agreement  with  the  results  of  Millikan  and  Hanger  (35), who  worked  with
subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). Autoradiograph and radio assays revealed varia-
tion between seedlings of open pollinated pecans with respect to rate of Zn absorption (37). For
example, one set of seedlings absorbed extremes from 0.7 to 91 mg Zn kg⫺1 if roots were exposed
to 65Zn in a beaker of water for 96 h.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Grauke et al. (58) detected the highest concentration of zinc in pecan seedlings originating from
west  Texas  populations  compared  to  those  populations  indigenous  to  east  Texas, regardless  of
whether they were grown in central Texas or Georgia. Selecting hard woodcuttings from the best of
the west Texas populations would appear to be an ideal way to use clonal rootstocks as a means of
establishing pecan orchards on uniformly zinc-absorbing rootstocks in place of the very heterozy-
gous seedlings used in the last 100 years. McEachern (59) consistently was able to root 40% of the
juvenile  stem  cuttings  that  he  treated, whereas  less  than  10%  of  the  adult  cuttings  survived.
However, the juvenile growth of a pecan tree is conﬁned to the bottom 3 m of the trunk up from the
ground line (60). This portion of the trunk is intermediate in rooting response, and all distal trunk
and branches are adult. Heavy pollarding of the trees produce only adult compensatory growth that
will not root. Juvenile tissue tends to have a high IAA / low ABA ratio, whereas adult tissue tends
to have low IAA / high ABA (59). Only about 12% of juvenile pecan stem cuttings developed viable
root  systems  in  greenhouse  studies, and  none  of  the  adult  cuttings  initiated  roots  (59).  Only  the
lower 2 m of the trunk of the original seedling tree of a pecan cultivar is juvenile and eligible to pro-
duce cuttings that are capable of rooting (59).

Tissue  culture  became  the  popular  means  of  clonal  propagation  in  the  1960s  because  of  the
work of Skoog and Miller (61). Smith (62) was unsuccessful after trying most of the known plant
growth regulators because of endogenous fungi that deﬁed all sanitation procedures. Pecan tissue
culture was plagued with Alternaria spp. in another study (63). This contamination is more severe
in orchard-grown than in greenhouse-grown pecan seedlings but was still present under the most
sterile growing conditions. Knox’s attempt to culture pecan was unsuccessful. Knox advanced the
theory that Alternaria is an endophyte or resident fungus. Knox (63) stated that the host pecan tree
does not appear to be disadvantaged or diseased. If the vigor of the tree is essentially unaltered, then
the fungus cannot be considered a pathogen and is more appropriately described as an endophyte
or  resident.  The  vigor  of  cultured  pecan  tissues  apparently  is  enhanced  by  the  fungus, perhaps
implying  a  mutualistic  relationship  between  Alternaria and  pecan  trees.  There  has  been  a  long
precedence for resident fungi in pecan roots because ectomycorrhizal fungi are prominent in native
pecan groves and are considered to enhance zinc absorption by pecan roots from leaf mulch. Native
pecan trees on fence lines, separating a cultivated ﬁeld from a native pecan grove that is not tilled,
will inevitably be rosetted on the side of the tree where the soil has been disturbed by disking com-
pared to normal healthy growth on the untilled side of the tree.

Pecan tissue ﬁnally was cultured successfully by using single-node cuttings obtained from 2-
month-old seedlings of pecan (64). Cuttings were induced to break buds and form multiple shoots
in liquid, woody plant medium and 2% glucose supplemented with 6-benzylamino purine. In vitro-
derived shoots soaked in 1 to 3 mg indolebutyric acid (IBA) per liter produced adventitious shoots
in vitro; when soaked for 8 days in 10 mg IBA per liter, they were rooted successfully in soil and
acclimated to greenhouse conditions. Etiolation of stock plants did not improve shoot proliferation
or rooting under in vitro culture (64).

Absorption  of  zinc  varies  with  species.  For  example, Khadr  and  Wallace  (65)  reported  that
rough lemon (Citrus aurantium L.) absorbed more 65Zn and 59Fe from the soil than trifoliate orange
(Poncirus trifoliate Raf.).

15.10 FOLIAR ABSORPTION
Tank mixing urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer (UAN; 0.5% by weight) with ZnSO4 increased leaﬂet
zinc concentration compared to using ZnSO4 alone in pecan. Zinc nitrate was more eﬃcient than
ZnSO4 in increasing leaﬂet concentration, especially if tank mixed with UAN (0.5%). Zinc con-
centrations of spray solutions can be reduced by one eighth to one fourth of the current recom-
mended rate as ZnSO4 at 86 g per 100 L of water. Use of the lowest rate of Zn(NO3)2, 10.8 g per
100 L of water ⫹ UAN, increased yield and income over the recommended rate of ZnSO4 (66). This
⫹ UAN  was  patented  under  the
paper  plus  earlier  work  that  led  to  the  formulation  of  Zn(NO3)2

name NZN. (NZN was patented in 1971 by J. Benton Storey and Allied Chemical Co. under the
trade  mark  registration  No.  1041108).  The  work  was  documented  by  Storey  and  coworkers
(34,45,46,66–75).

Grauke (76) followed with research which evaluated and expanded previous work with NZN
and considered problems of precipitation of zinc in spray formulations. He noted that precipitation
of  ZnSO4 occurs  from  NZN  stock  solutions  with  5%  Zn  and  that  use  of  solutions  with  1%  Zn
avoided precipitation. Earlier, Wallace et al. (77) reported increasing absorption of zinc from ZnSO4
with increasing alkalinity up to pH 8. However, use of high-pH zinc formulations is limited because
of low stability of the formulations and the precipitation of zinc when stock solutions of high pH
are diluted with water. To avoid precipitation, the ZnSO4 and UAN should be sprinkled into an agi-
tated, full tank of water (76).

Pecan  and  corn  (Zea  mays  L.)  leaves  absorbed  more  Zn  from  NZN  than  from  ZnSO4 , and
absorption of both formulations was increased at high humidity. Grauke (76) noted that differences
in the absorption of the formulations were related to their effective concentrations, calculated by
multiplying the molecular concentration of the solution by its activity coefficient. Activity coeffi-
cients  are  factors  which, when  multiplied  by  the  molar  concentrations, yield  the  active  mass  or
effective concentration. Activity coefficients may be calculated for solutions are less that 0.01 M by
using the Debye-Huckel equation

where ∑ is the sum of the concentrations, Ci, for each ionic species multiplied by the formal charge
Zi on the ith ion. For example, a 200 mg L⫺1 solution of Zn(NO3)2 has an ionic strength (µ) of 0.009.
When that ﬁgure is used in the above equation, the activity coeﬃcient (Y ⫾ ) is equal to 0.597. When
each of these factors are multiplied by the mole concentration of the solutions, which is 0.003 for
each  solution, the  active  mass  of  respective  solutions  is  obtained: 0.0024 M  (156.9 mg  L⫺1)  for
Zn(NO3)2 and 0.0018 M (117.7 mg L⫺1) for ZnSO4. Therefore, although equal concentrations of the
two  solutions  were  applied, the  active  mass  of  the  ZnSO4 solution  was  only  75%  of  that  in  the
Zn(NO3)2 solution.
Application of a 10-µL drop of a 200 mg L⫺1 solution of 65ZnSO4 resulted in sorption of 46%
of the applied label. The portion of the applied label absorbed by a leaf treated with a 10-µL drop
of 200 mg L⫺1 65Zn(NO3)2 was 74%. Therefore, sorption from the ZnSO4 solution was 62% of that
for the Zn(NO3)2 solution (76).

⫹ NH4NO3

The  inclusion  of  NH4NO3 and  urea  to  either  Zn(NO3)2 or  ZnSO4 resulted  in  a  signiﬁcant
increase  in  translocation  of  absorbed  zinc.  There  was  no  signiﬁcant  diﬀerence  in  movement  of
⫹ urea.  However, the
absorbed  zinc  between  ZnSO4
⫹ urea would be greater,
total amount of zinc available to leaves treated with Zn(NO3)2
since much more of the applied zinc was absorbed. These data indicate that the eﬃciency of a foliar
⫹ urea  treatment, which
zinc  application  could  be  increased  by  using  the  Zn(NO3)2
increases  the  amount  of  total  zinc  absorbed  by  the  leaf  as  well  as  the  percentage  of  absorbed 
zinc translocated from the treatment site. The latter two ingredients of the triad are contained in a
commercial 32% N, liquid UAN fertilizer. Grauke’s (76) meticulous evaluation of this triad proved

⫹ urea  did  not  result  in  increased  sorption  of  either  Zn(NO3)2 or
that  the  presence  of  NH4NO3
ZnSO4 as  would  be  expected  if  urea  facilitated  cuticular  penetration  (78).  Wadsworth  (37)  and
Grauke  (76)  showed  that  Zn(NO3)2 increased  zinc  absorption  more  than  ZnSO4 with  or  without
urea.  By  increasing  the  total  absorption  of  labeled  zinc  from  Zn(NO3)2 and  by  increasing  the
⫹ urea, these treatment showed increased eﬃciency
translocation of absorbed zinc from NH4NO3
for foliar zinc fertilization.

A 1975 article in California Farmer (California Farmer was a trade journal that featured new
products but was not given a publication number) reported positive response with NZN on almonds,
cherries, peaches, apples, walnuts, grapes, tomatoes, and head lettuce. The NZN provides the leaf
with zinc that is available for synthesis of IAA, which stimulates shoot growth and leaf expansion.
The necessity of applying zinc when the cuticles are less formidable dictates application when the
leaves are ﬁrst developing. Most leaf expansion of bearing pecan shoots occurs in the ﬁrst 2 months
of growth, so zinc foliar sprays should be applied at ﬁrst sign of the green tip emerging through the
terminal bud scales. Subsequent foliar Zn sprays should be applied 1, 3, 5, and 8 weeks after green
tip (74,79). These early season Zn sprays were based on the work by Wadsworth (37) with pecans
and are also supported by the conclusion of Franke (80) that immature leaves with thinner cuticles
were more absorptive than mature leaves and that the lower leaf surfaces, which also had thinner
cuticles, were slightly more absorptive than the upper leaf surfaces. Labelled 65Zn absorbed by the
immature leaves moved primarily acropetally and was deposited in the midrib and lateral veins of
the treated leaf.

Small  amounts  of  65Zn  were  transported  basipetally  within  the  leaf  from  the  treatment  spot
down the petiole into the transport system of the stem. Acropetal movement of  65Zn was consis-
tently dramatic when 73 µg of Zn as ZnSO4, which contained 3.4 µCi 65Zn, was applied to the stem
of pecan seedlings by insertion under a phloem patch, thus proving that once zinc negotiates the
cuticle there is no problem of rapid acropetal transport (37).

An  important  unique  feature  of  NZN  is  its  ability  to  transport  zinc  absorbed  from  a  10 µ L
droplet of 200 mg Zn L⫺1 labeled with 0.3 µCi 65Zn. The percentage of absorbed zinc detected away
from the treatment site was greater in leaves treated with NZN (81).

Landscape maintenance ﬁrms in the Southwest have long had problems with ZnSO4-induced
defoliation of woody ornamentals and fruit trees during spraying of the large ubiquitous pecan trees
in landscapes because of drift to landscape species that are susceptible to ZnSO4-induced defolia-
tion. Foliar treatment of 18 species of container-grown woody ornamentals with NZN resulted in
no  spray  damage  (82).  Zinc  concentrations  were  increased  in  13  species  compared  to  untreated
plants. Quality was improved in three species without a related increase in zinc content. The orna-
mentals in this study were not expected to beneﬁt from zinc because they were growing in acid
media.

Peach  trees  are  notoriously  susceptible  to  ZnSO4-induced  defoliation  (83).  However, trees
suﬀering from zinc deﬁciency may develop ‘little leaf’ if not supplied with zinc. In early prac-
tices, use of ZnSO4 was recommended commonly for control of bacterial leaf spot (Phytomonas
pruni) (84,85). ZnSO4 was considered eﬀective in controlling bacterial leaf spot on peaches in
the 1940s, but the spray solution had to include hydrated lime to prevent defoliation (79). Storey
Orchards was established on upland sand in 1932 in Red River county, Texas, and grew to 70
acres in the early 1940s. All of the labor, with the exception of harvest, was supplied by the three
family members. My remembrance of childhood was spraying the ‘Burbank July Elberta’ trees
with ZnSO4 for the control of bacterial leaf spot and use of hydrated lime to prevent ZnSO4 spray
burn.  Similarly, Sherbakoﬀ and  Andes  (86)  and  Kadow  and  Anderson  (84,85)  reported  that
hydrated lime was used with lead arsenate (PbHAsO4 ) to prevent leaf burn. Lead arsenate was
used for plum curculio control (85). It is interesting to note that PbHAsO4, ZnSO4, and Ca(OH)2
were last reported in a peach spray guide (87) in which DDT was mentioned ﬁrst. DDT was far
more eﬀective in plum curculio control than PbHAsO4, but its use diminished the amounts of zinc
applied. Johnson et al. (88) published a spray guide that recommended a copper fungicide and

CRC_DK2972_Ch015.qxd  7/1/2006  7:36 AM  Page 427

eliminated the need for ZnSO4 in pest control. This recommendation also overlooked the value
of ZnSO4 to supply zinc for tree vigor. Today, NZN is used to supply zinc without the danger of
spray burn.

Some sandy soils where peaches are grown, such as in Hidalgo county in South Texas and the
ridge in Florida (89), are zinc-deﬁcient. In both areas the typical symptom of ‘little leaf’ was com-
mon. Arce (19,20) used three diﬀerent zinc fertilizers in a Hidalgo county peach orchard. All three
fertilizers gave excellent response in preventing little leaf.

15.10.1 INFLUENCE OF HUMIDITY ON FOLIAR ABSORPTION
The method of zinc application is critical. Growers are tempted to use custom-ﬁxed-wing aircraft
instead of investing in hydraulic or air-mist ground sprayers. An application of ZnSO4 at 11.2 kg Zn
ha⫺1 produced leaves containing 117 mg Zn kg⫺1 on ground-sprayed trees compared with 34 mg Zn
kg⫺1 in  aerially  sprayed  trees  (34). A  typical  airplane  application  is  52 L  ha⫺1 (5  gal  per  acre),
whereas a ground application is typically 1728 L ha⫺1 (200 gal per acre). The limited spray volume
of  water  from  air  application  evaporates  before  adequate  absorption  occurs, particularly  in  arid
climates.

Pecan leaves treated either with ZnSO4 or NZN at 80% relative humidity showed increased zinc
absorption relative to those treated at 40% RH (76). This result is consistent with observations made
by Rossi and Beauchamp (90) of increased absorption of ZnSO4 and ZnCl2 at high humidity. Leaves
treated under high humidity conditions maintained substantial amounts of surface moisture for 24 h.
The increase in sorption is a reﬂection of the increased hydration, which permitted a longer period
of  uptake. The  inclusion  of  humectants  in  foliar  soybeans  increased  leaf  nitrogen  contents  (91).
Stein and Storey (91) evaluated 46 diﬀerent adjuvants in a variety of classes, including alcohols,
amines, carbohydrates, esters, ethoxylated  hydrocarbons, phosphates, polyethylene  glycols, pro-
teins, silicones, sulfates, sulfonates, and alcohol alkoxylates. Glycerol was the only adjuvant that
increased  the  percentage  of  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  in  leaves  over  the  foliar  fertilizer  controls,
which had no adjuvant.

A simple demonstration often used in classroom lectures utilizes a Petri dish of dry ZnSO4 that
remains dry throughout a 50-min class period, whereas a Petri dish containing dry Zn(NO3)2 will
contain large drops of water at the end of the class period. The facts that ZnSO4 is hydrophobic and
Zn(NO3)2 is hydrophilic makes the latter more appropriate for arid climates. Relative humidity nor-
mally rises to 30% within 30 min after sunrise and rapidly falls to as low as 5% in the El Paso and
Mesilla Valleys of Texas and New Mexico (34).

Addition of surfactants reduced hydration time of aerially applied zinc solutions to one third of
those without surfactant. The hydration time of a chelated zinc fertilizer alone was 34 min and that
of the fertilizer with surfactant was only12 min in the arid climate of the El PasoValley (37). With
aerial application at 4 kg Zn ha⫺1 (in 76 L of water), foliar zinc content was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
at  43 mg  kg⫺1 without  surfactant  and  31 mg  kg⫺1 with  surfactant.  In  another  experiment, zinc
absorption from chelated zinc was reduced from 43 mg kg⫺1 without surfactant to 31 mg kg⫺1 with
surfactant.  Likewise, zinc  accumulation  from  ZnSO4 treatments  containing  no  surfactant  was
reduced from 59 to 38 mg kg⫺1 with surfactant. Accelerated evaporation rate was probably due to
the surfactants reducing the surface tension of the solution droplets, thus allowing the droplets to
spread more evenly over the leaf and thus accelerated loss of spray solution. With the treatment
solutions devoid of surfactants, the droplets stood higher thereby decreasing the evaporative sur-
face, allowing additional time for Zn absorption (80). Likewise, pecan trees treated with ZnSO4, via
a ground sprayer, at the rate of 5.6 kg Zn per acre in 1892 L of water, at 40% RH, produced leaves
containing 189 mg Zn kg⫺1 with a surfactant and 301 mg kg⫺1 without a surfactant (37).

Fully  expanded  mature  pecan  leaves  were  ineﬃcient  in  foliar  absorption  of  ZnSO4. Abaxial
pecan leaf surfaces are only slightly more absorptive than adaxial surfaces (37). The diﬀerences
were much greater than those reported by Malavolta et al. (92) but were similar to those reported

CRC_DK2972_Ch015.qxd  7/1/2006  7:36 AM  Page 428

428

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

by Heymann-Herschberg (93) for citrus, who further concluded that absorption through the stom-
ata  was  unimportant.  Franke  (80)  pointed  to  the  cuticular  leaf  surface  as  the  controller  of  ion
absorption. Wadsworth  (37)  noted  that  the  immature  leaves  with  thinner  cuticles  absorbed  more
zinc than mature leaves. He also found that abaxial surfaces with thinner cuticles were more absorp-
tive  than  adaxial  surfaces. Acropetal  transport  of  zinc  was  the  primary  direction  of  movement.
Fourteen percent of the zinc was translocated from auxiliary buds compared with 1% from zinc
applied to leaf midribs. This diﬀerence suggests that the tender buds had less cuticle than a fully
expanded leaf.

Zinc accumulates in the young, expanding leaves. Translocated 65Zn was found predominately
in  the  stem, midrib, and  lateral  veins  with  relatively  small  amounts  in  the  mesophyll  (37).
Resistance of movement was in the abscission zone. Millikan and Hanger (36) determined that 65Zn
accumulated in the nodes. Histological studies would probably conﬁrm a concentration of small
cells in the abscission zone, thus accounting for the accumulation of zinc.

15.11 ROLE OF ZINC IN DNA AND RNA METABOLISM 

AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

The role of zinc in cell division and protein synthesis has been known for a long time, but recently
a new class of zinc-dependent protein molecules (zinc metalloproteins) has been identiﬁed in DNA
replication and transcription, thus regulating gene expression (10,11). Zinc is required for binding
of speciﬁc genes with tetrahedral bonds that result in transcription. By this means the polypeptide
chain forms a loop of usually 11 to 13 amino acid residues, which bind the speciﬁc DNA sequences.
Zinc is therefore directly involved in the translation step of gene expression of DNA elements in
these DNA-binding metalloproteins.

Amino acids accumulate in zinc-deﬁcient plants as protein content decreases (54). Protein syn-
thesis resumes when zinc is resupplied because zinc is a structural component of the ribosomes and
responsible for their structural integrity. Ribosomes disintegrate in the absence of zinc, but recon-
stitution reoccurs with the resupply of zinc.

15.12 ZINC TRANSPORTERS AND ZINC EFFICIENCY

The goal of improving Zn utilization eﬃciency in grafted tree crops is complicated by a complex
genetic  system  involving  scion  and  rootstock, each  of  which  may  contribute  to  the  zinc  uptake
mechanism  via  systems  that  are  only  poorly  understood.  In  pecan  (research  at  Texas  A&M
University by Storey and colleagues), the genetic adaptations related to nutrient uptake in general
vary across the geographic distribution of the species. Leaves were analyzed from ungrafted pecan
seedlings grown from seed collected from native pecan populations representing the range of the
species.  Diﬀerences  in  leaf  structure  and  composition  were  related  to  seed  origin, with  highest
speciﬁc leaf weights and lowest leaﬂet area in seedlings originating from Western populations on
alkaline  soils. These  populations  were  also  characterized  by  higher  leaf  zinc  concentration  (58).
Pecan cultivars grafted to a common rootstock in a replicated test orchard manifested dramatically
diﬀerent levels of apparent zinc deﬁciency. Leaves were analyzed for zinc concentrations, which
were determined to be quite variable, with the most severe deﬁciency symptoms on the cultivar with
the  lowest  leaf  zinc  concentration.  However, leaf  Zn  was  correlated  poorly  to  visual  deﬁciency
symptoms. Some cultivars with no visual deﬁciency symptoms had leaf levels in the lowest range,
whereas some of these had high leaf Zn concentration.

In an eﬀort to develop a molecular understanding for these zinc nutritional observations, eﬀorts
have been initiated to identify zinc transporter genes in this species. Zinc transport across cellular and
intracellular membranes is facilitated by several types of membrane-localized proteins, especially the

CRC_DK2972_Ch015.qxd  7/1/2006  7:36 AM  Page 429

recently characterized Zip transporter family. The name Zip stands for zrt-like, irt-like protein, with
zrt (zinc-regulated  transporter)  and  irt (iron-regulated  transporter)  referring  to  metal  transporter
genes identiﬁed in yeast (94). Several plant genes from various species (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana,
pea, tomato, soybean) have now been identiﬁed whose translation products demonstrate high homol-
ogy with the Zip family (95). Functional analysis of several of these proteins has demonstrated them
to be divalent metal transporters, with some having high selectivity for Zn2+ (96). Recent work in
Grusak’s laboratory (M.A. Grusak, USDA-ARS Baylor College of Medicine, Weslaco, TX, U.S.A.,
personal communication) has led to the identiﬁcation of six new Zip genes in the model legume,
annual or barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.), with some of the genes showing diﬀerential
expression  in  leaves  versus  roots, or  in  response  to  Zn-replete  versus  Zn-deﬁcient  conditions
(Grusak, personal  communication). With  the  assistance  of  Grauke  (USDA-ARS, Somerville, TX,
U.S.A.), Grusak’s group has used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approaches to attempt to clone
Zip genes in pecan. Primers developed from the Medicago truncatula Zip sequences were used to
perform PCRs with mRNA isolated from pecan leaves. Leaf samples were collected from a cultivar
with  low  leaf  zinc  concentration  and  severe  deﬁciency  from  a  cultivar  with  low  leaf  zinc  and  no
apparent deﬁciency, and from a cultivar with high leaf Zn and no apparent deﬁciency. Current results
have yielded at least three diﬀerent PCR products from the pecans, whose predicted translations indi-
cate high amino acid sequence homology to Zip proteins from M. truncatula and other species (see
(97,98) and López-Millán, Grusak, and Grauke, unpublished results). Preliminary qualitative PCR
analysis also suggests that a putative pecan Zip shows higher levels of mRNA expression in the pecan
cultivars with no apparent leaf Zn deﬁciency (i.e., those with either high or low leaf Zn concentra-
tion). This Zip could be localized to a subcellular membrane and might inﬂuence or improve the
intracellular partitioning of zinc. These results are exciting because they suggest that whole-plant
zinc eﬃciency may be inﬂuenced by scion characteristics. For maximum beneﬁt to cultivated pecan,
therefore, appropriate root-mediated uptake mechanisms (e.g., root vigor) may need to be compati-
bly combined with scion-mediated uptake mechanisms (e.g., the expression or regulation of Zn trans-
port  proteins).  Further  characterization  of  the  pecan  Zip genes, including  analysis  of  possible
polymorphisms between genotypes of diverse geographic origin, should enhance our understanding
of zinc nutrition in this crop, and possibly provide tools for breeding new zinc-eﬃcient cultivars.

15.13 SUMMARY

Twentieth century zinc research has discovered that a lack of zinc is expressed in plants as rosettes,
low vigor, poor leaf development, and eventual death progressing from the terminal branches. Zinc
is unavailable in alkaline soils because of formation of insoluble ZnCO3 and in acid soil where zinc
is in competition with nickel. Foliar application has proven diﬃcult because of cuticular barriers as
leaves become mature. Frequent zinc foliar applications are more successful than occasional treat-
ments. Traditional ZnSO4 foliar treatments have proven inadequate compared to a nitrate-based zinc
⫹ urea. Nitrogen is superior to
spray. The new formula is NZN consisting of Zn(NO3)2
sulfur for many reasons in enhancing zinc absorption. Nitrogen is an integral part of all amino acids,
whereas sulfur is found in only a few. Sulfur accumulates on the surface of treated crops and can
cause spray burn in many. Nitrates are hydrophilic and sulfates are hydrophobic which inﬂuence
their ability to enter cuticles of treated crops in arid environments.

The increase from 200,000 to 12 million pounds of pecan production in the 30 year span from
1967  to  1997  of  the  zinc  research  in  the Trans  Pecos  area  of Texas  is  more  than  a  coincidence
(USDA Agricultural Statistics, Texas Department of Agriculture, 1997). This comparison is more
justiﬁed than in other areas because lack of zinc was the limiting factor in that area. The zinc nutri-
tion problem that confronted the industry in 1965 has been solved. Obviously, the eﬀorts of a num-
ber of hard-working pecan growers and horticulturists were instrumental in securing this massive
production increase.

There has been a long, unsuccessful struggle to develop a rootstock that will facilitate zinc root
absorption. A small percentage of pecan seedlings will absorb and transport zinc. Zinc-regulated
transporter  proteins  have  been  found  in  some  pecan  seedlings  that  promise  to  revolutionize  the
pecan industry and other species. This development is the future to which we can all look, for all of
our zinc-deﬁcient species. The preceding horticulturist and agronomists cited in this chapter have
discovered the problem. Now the next generation, using advanced technology like zinc-regulated
transporter proteins, will eliminate the expense of foliar sprays and soil treatments.

16.1 INTRODUCTION
Soils contain an average of 7% total aluminum (Al), and under acidic conditions, aluminum is sol-
ubilized (1), increasing availability to plants and aquatic animals. Soil acidiﬁcation due to applica-
tion  of  fertilizers, growing  of  legumes, or  acid  rain  is  an  increasing  problem  in  agricultural  and
natural ecosystems (2–4).

No conclusive evidence suggests that aluminum is an essential nutrient for either plants (5) or
animals (6,7), although there are a few instances of beneﬁcial eﬀects. Aluminum is toxic to plants
and animals, interfering with cytoskeleton structure and function, disrupting calcium homeostasis,
interfering with phosphorus metabolism, and causing oxidative stress (discussed in later sections).

16.2 ALUMINUM-ACCUMULATING PLANTS
Relative  to  aluminum  accumulation, there  appears  to  be  two  groups  of  plant  species: aluminum
excluders and aluminum accumulators (8). Most plant species, particularly crop plants, are aluminum
excluders.  Aluminum  contents  in  most  herbaceous  plants  averaged  200 mg  kg⫺1 in  leaves
(Hutchinson, cited in [9]). Chenery (10,11) analyzed leaves of various species of monocots and dicots
for aluminum content, and deﬁned aluminum accumulators as those plants with 1000 mg Al kg⫺1 or
greater in leaves. Aluminum accumulation appears to be a primitive character, found frequently among
perennial, woody species in tropical rain forests (9,12).

Masunaga  et  al.  (13)  studied  65  tree  species  and  12  unidentiﬁed  species  considered  to  be
aluminum  accumulators  in  a  tropical  rain  forest  in  West  Sumatra  and  suggested  that  aluminum
accumulators  be  divided  further  into  two  groups: (a)  those  with  aluminum  concentrations  lower
than  3000 mg  kg⫺1;  and  (b)  those  with  higher  aluminum  concentrations.  For  trees  with  foliar
aluminum  concentrations  greater  than  3000 mg  kg⫺1, positive  correlations  were  noted  between
aluminum concentrations and phosphorus or silicon concentrations in leaves.

Although Chenery (11) did not consider gymnosperms to be aluminum accumulators, Truman
et al. (14) proposed that most Pinus species are facultative aluminum accumulators. In Australia, val-
ues of foliar aluminum ranged from 321 to 1412 mg kg⫺1 for Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don),
51 to 1251 mg kg⫺1 for slash pine (Pinus elliotii Engelm.), and 643 to 2173 mg kg⫺1 for loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda L.) (15). In addition, foliar aluminum concentrations ⱖ 1000 mg kg⫺1 were reported in
Monterey  pine  and  black  pine  (Pinus  nigra J.F.  Arnold)  grown  in  nutrient  solutions  containing
aluminum (14,16,17).

Tea (Camellia sinensis Kuntze) is one crop plant considered to be an aluminum accumulator,
with aluminum concentrations of 30,700 mg kg⫺1 in mature leaves, but much lower concentrations
of only 600 mg kg⫺1 in young leaves (18). Most of the aluminum was localized in the cell walls of
the epidermis of mature leaves (18).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Another  well-known  aluminum-accumulating  plant  is  hydrangea  (Hydrangea  macrophylla
Ser.), which has blue-colored sepals when the plant is grown in acidic soils and red-colored sepals
when grown in alkaline soils. The blue color of hydrangea sepals is due to aluminum complexing
with the anthocyanin, delphinidin 3-glucoside, and the copigment, 3-caﬀeoylquinic acid (19).

Two excellent reviews of aluminum accumulators are by Jansen et al. (9) and Watanabe and

Osaki (8). Possible mechanisms of aluminum tolerance will be discussed in later sections.

16.3 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF ALUMINUM IN PLANTS

16.3.1 GROWTH STIMULATION
Not surprisingly, aluminum addition has a growth stimulatory eﬀect on aluminum accumulators. In
tea, addition of aluminum and phosphorus increased phosphorus absorption and translocation as
well  as  root  and  shoot  growth  (20,21).  Similarly, the  aluminum-accumulating  shrub, Melastoma
malabathricum L., exhibited increased growth of leaf, stem, and roots as well as increased phos-
phorus accumulation when aluminum was added to culture solutions (22).

Low  levels  of  aluminum  sometimes  stimulate  root  and  shoot  growth  of  nonaccumulators.
Turnip (Brassica rapa L. subsp. campestris A.R. Clapham) root lengths were increased by increas-
ing aluminum levels up to 1.2 µM at pH 4.6 (23). Soybean (Glycine max Merr.) root elongation and
⫺ uptake increased with increasing aluminum concentrations up to 10 µM, but were reduced
15NO3
when  aluminum  levels  increased  further  to  44 µM  (24).  Shoot  and  root  growth  of  Douglas  ﬁr
(Pseudotsuga  menziesii Franco)  seedlings  were  stimulated  by  increasing  aluminum  levels  up  to
150 µM but were reduced at higher aluminum levels (25). Root elongation of an aluminum-tolerant
race of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) increased as solution aluminum increased up to 930 µM
Al but then decreased at 1300 µM Al (26). Several researchers (23–25,27,28) have hypothesized
that low levels of Al3⫹ ameliorated the toxic eﬀects of H⫹ on cell walls, membranes, or nutrient
transport, but aluminum-toxic eﬀects predominated at higher aluminum levels.

16.3.2 INHIBITION OF PLANT PATHOGENS
Aluminum can be toxic to pathogenic microorganisms, thus helping plants to avoid disease. Spore
germination and vegetative growth of the black root rot pathogen, Thielaviopsis basicola Ferraris,
were inhibited by 350 µM Al at pH 5 (29). Similarly, mycelial growth and sporangial germination of
potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, were inhibited by 185 µM Al, and Andrivon (30)
speculated that amendment of soils with aluminum might be used as a means of disease control.

16.4 ALUMINUM ABSORPTION AND TRANSPORT WITHIN PLANTS

16.4.1 PHYTOTOXIC SPECIES
The most phytotoxic form of aluminum is Al3⫹ (more correctly, Al(H2O)6
3⫹), which predominates
in  solutions  below  pH  4.5  (31–33)  (Figure  16.1).  Possibly, hydroxyl-aluminum  (AlOH2⫹ and
⫹)  ions  are  also  phytotoxic, particularly  to  dicotyledonous  plants  (31,34).  However, as
Al(OH)2
pointed out by many researchers (35,36), these aluminum species are interrelated along with the pH
variable, so it is diﬃcult to rank their relative toxicity.

In contrast, Al-F, Al-SO4, and Al-P species are much less toxic or even nontoxic to plants (34,37).
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots were unaﬀected by aluminum when 2.5 to 10 µM F⫺ was added
to nutrient solution containing up to 8 µM total soluble aluminum (37). Also using nutrient solution,
⫹
Kinraide and Parker (38) positively demonstrated the nontoxic nature of Al-SO4 complexes (AlSO4
⫺) for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). Soybean had
and Al(SO4)2
longer root growth when increasing amounts of phosphorus were added to nutrient solutions having
constant total aluminum concentrations (39).

ysis equilibria. Cooperativity in Al3⫹ hydrolysis reactions. J. Inorg. Biochem. 44:141–147, 1991.)

16.4.2 ABSORPTION
Since aluminum is a trivalent cation in its phytotoxic form in the external medium, it does not eas-
ily cross the plasma membrane. Akeson and Munns (40) calculated that the endocytosis of Al3⫹
could contribute to its absorption. Alternatively, it is possible that Al3⫹ could be absorbed through
calcium channels (41) or nonspeciﬁc cation channels.

Our understanding of aluminum absorption across plant membranes has been limited by the
complex speciation of Al, its binding to cell walls, lack of an aﬀordable and available isotope, and
lack of sensitive analytical techniques to measure low levels of aluminum in subcellular compart-
ments (42). Aluminum absorption by excised roots of wheat, cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), let-
tuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov.), and by
cell suspensions of snapbean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) followed biphasic kinetics (43–45). A rapid,
nonlinear, nonmetabolic phase of uptake occurred during the ﬁrst 20 to 30 min. This nonsaturable
phase was thought to be accumulation in the apoplastic compartment due to polymerization or pre-
cipitation of aluminum or binding to exchange sites in cell walls (44). A linear, metabolic phase of
uptake was superimposed over the nonlinear phase and thought to be accumulation in the symplas-
mic compartment (i.e., within the plasma membrane).

Using  the  rare  26Al  isotope  and  accelerator  mass  spectrometry  on  giant  algal  cells  of  Chara
corallina Klein ex Willd., Taylor et al. (42) provided the ﬁrst unequivocal evidence that aluminum
rapidly crosses the plasma membrane into the symplasm. Accumulation of 26Al in the cell wall was
nonsaturable  during  3 h  of  aluminum  exposure  and  accounted  for  most  of  aluminum  uptake.
Absorption  of  aluminum  into  the  protoplasm  occurred  immediately  but  accounted  for  less  than
0.05%  of  the  total  accumulation  (42). Accumulation  in  the  vacuole  occurred  after  a  30-min  lag
period (42).

16.4.3 ALUMINUM SPECIATION IN SYMPLASM
The  pH  of  the  cytoplasmic  compartment  generally  ranges  from  7.3  to  7.6  (5).  Once  aluminum
⫺ or insoluble Al(OH)3 could form (Figure 16.1)
enters the symplasm, the aluminate ion, Al(OH)4
(46). Alternatively, Al3⫹ could precipitate with phosphate as variscite, Al(OH)2H2PO4 (47). Based
on higher stability constants, it is likely that Al3⫹ would be complexed by organic ligands, such as
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or citrate (47,48). Martin (47) hypothesized that based on their sim-
ilar  eﬀective  ionic  radii  and  aﬃnity  for  oxygen  donor  ligands, Al3⫹ would  compete  with  Mg2⫹
rather than Ca2⫹ in metabolic processes.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

16.4.4 RADIAL TRANSPORT
The main barrier to radial transport of aluminum across the root into the stele appears to be the endo-
dermis. Rasmussen (49) used electron microprobe x-ray analysis to show little penetration of alu-
minum past the endodermis of corn (Zea mays L.) roots. Similarly, in Norway spruce (Picea abies
H. Karst.) roots, a large aluminum concentration was detected outside the endodermis, but very low
aluminum concentrations on the inner tangential wall (3,50). Using secondary-ion mass spectrome-
try, Lazof et al. (51) conﬁrmed that the highest aluminum accumulation occurred at the root periph-
ery of soybean root tips, with substantial aluminum in cortical cells, but very low aluminum in stellar
tissues. Similar to calcium, aluminum is thought to bypass the endodermis, entering the xylem in
maturing tissues where the endodermis is not fully suberized.

16.4.5 MUCILAGE
Aluminum  must  cross  the  root  mucilage  before  it  can  penetrate  to  the  root  apical  meristem.
Mucilage is produced by the root cap and is a complex mixture of high-molecular-weight polysac-
charides, a population of several thousand border cells, and an array of cell wall fragments (52).
Archambault et al. (53) showed that aluminum binds tightly to wheat mucilage, with 25 to 35% of
total aluminum remaining after citrate desorption.

16.5 ALUMINUM TOXICITY SYMPTOMS IN PLANTS

16.5.1 SHORT-TERM EFFECTS
Owing to the numerous biochemical processes with which aluminum can interfere, researchers have
attempted to determine the primary phytotoxic event by searching for the earliest responses to alu-
minum. Symptoms of aluminum toxicity that occur within a few hours of aluminum exposure are
inhibition of root elongation, disruption of root cap processes, callose formation, lignin deposition,
and decline in cell division.

16.5.1.1 Inhibition of Root Elongation
The  ﬁrst, easily  observable  symptom  of  aluminum  toxicity  is  inhibition  of  root  elongation.
Elongation of adventitious onion (Allium cepa L.) roots (54), and primary roots of soybean (55,56),
corn (57,58), and wheat (59–61) were suppressed within 1 to 3 h of aluminum exposure. The short-
est time of aluminum exposure required to inhibit elongation rates was observed in seminal roots
of an aluminum-sensitive corn cultivar BR 201F after 30 min (62).

Application of aluminum to the terminal 0 to 3 mm of corn root must occur for inhibition of root
elongation to occur; however, the presence of the root cap was not necessary for aluminum-induced
growth depression (63). Using further reﬁnement of techniques, Sivaguru and Horst (58) determined
that the most aluminum-sensitive site in corn was between 1 and 2 mm from the root apex, or the dis-
tal transition zone (DTZ), where cells are switching from cell division to cell elongation.

Lateral root growth of soybean was inhibited by aluminum-containing solutions to a greater
extent than that of the taproot (64,65). Interestingly, Rasmussen (49) observed greater aluminum
accumulation in lateral roots that emerged from the root surface, breaking through the endodermal
layer. Similarly, root hair formation was more sensitive to aluminum toxicity than root elongation
in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) (66).

16.5.1.2 Disruption of Root Cap Processes

The Golgi apparatus is the site of synthesis of noncellulosic polysaccharides targeted to the cell wall
(67). Activity of the Golgi apparatus in the peripheral cap cells of corn was disrupted at 18 µM Al,

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 445

Aluminum

a concentration below that necessary to inhibit root growth (68). In wheat, mucilage from the root
cap disappeared within 1 h of aluminum exposure, and dictyosome volume and presence of endo-
plasmic  reticulum  decreased  within  4 h  (69).  Death  of  root  border  cells  (a  component  of  root
mucilage) occurred within 1 h of exposure to aluminum in snapbean roots (70).

16.5.1.3 Callose Formation
Callose is a polysaccharide consisting of 1,3-β-glucan chains, which are formed naturally by cells
at a speciﬁc stage of wall development or in response to wounding (67). An early symptom of alu-
minum toxicity is formation of callose in roots. Using ﬂuorescence spectrometry, callose could be
quantiﬁed in soybean root tips (0 to 3 cm from root apex) after 2 h of exposure to 50 µM Al (55). In
root cells surrounding the meristem of Norway spruce roots, distinct callose deposits were observed
after 3 h of exposure to 170 µM Al (71). Zhang et al. (72) showed that callose accumulated in roots
of aluminum-sensitive wheat cultivars exposed to 75 µM Al and they proposed using callose syn-
thesis as a rapid, sensitive marker for aluminum-induced injury. However, callose was not accumu-
lated  in  two  aluminum-sensitive  arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis  thaliana Heynh.)  mutants  exposed  to
aluminum, indicating no obligatory relationship between callose deposition and aluminum-induced
inhibition of root growth (73). Sivaguru et al. (74) showed that aluminum-induced callose deposi-
tion in plasmodesmata of epidermal and cortical cells of aluminum-sensitive wheat roots reduced
movement of micro-injected ﬂuorescent dyes between cells.

16.5.1.4 Lignin Deposition

Lignins are complex networks of aromatic compounds that are the distinguishing feature of sec-
ondary walls (67). Deposition of lignin in response to aluminum was found in wheat cortical cells
located 1.4 to 4.5 mm from the root tip (elongating zone [EZ]) after 3 h of exposure to 50 µM Al
(75).  Lignin  occurred  in  cells  with  damaged  plasma  membranes  as  indicated  by  staining  with
propidium iodide, and Sasaki et al. (61) proposed that aluminum-induced ligniﬁcation was a marker
of  aluminum  injury  and  was  closely  associated  with  inhibition  of  root  elongation.  Interestingly,
Snowden and Gardner (76) showed that a cDNA induced by aluminum treatment in wheat exhib-
ited high homology with the gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, a key enzyme in the pathway
for biosynthesis of lignin.

16.5.1.5 Decline in Cell Division
A decrease in abundance of mitotic ﬁgures was observed in adventitious roots of onion after 5 h of
exposure to 1 mM Al (54). Similarly, a decrease in the mitotic index of barley root tips was found
within 1 to 4 hours of exposure to 5 to 20 µM AI (pH 4.2) (77).

16.5.2 LONG-TERM EFFECTS
Although they may not be indicative of initial, primary phytotoxic events, long-term eﬀects of alu-
minum are important for plants growing in aluminum-toxic soils or subsoils. Long-term exposure
to aluminum over several days or weeks results in suppressed root and shoot biomass, abnormal
root morphology, suppressed nutrient uptake and translocation, restricted water uptake and trans-
port, suppressed photosynthesis, and inhibition of symbiosis with rhizobia.

16.5.2.1 Suppressed Root and Shoot Biomass
Increasing aluminum concentrations in solution, sand, or soil decreased ﬁne root biomass of red
spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) (78). Typically, aluminum reduces root biomass to a greater degree than

shoot biomass, resulting in a decreased root/shoot ratio (78–80). In contrast, in 3-year-old Scots
pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), increasing solution of aluminum up to 5.6 mM produced no obvious alu-
minum toxicity symptoms on roots but decreased needle length and whole shoot length, resulting
in increased needle density (81).

16.5.2.2 Abnormal Root Morphology

Often, one symptom of aluminum toxicity is ‘coralloid’ root morphology with inhibited lateral root
formation and thickened primary roots (54). Cells in the elongation zone of primary wheat roots
exposed to aluminum had decreased length and increased diameter, resulting in appearance of lat-
eral swelling (61). This abnormal root morphology combined with reduced root length could result
in decreased nutrient uptake and multiple deﬁciencies.

16.5.2.3 Suppressed Nutrient Uptake and Translocation

Increasing aluminum levels in the medium have been reported to decrease uptake and transloca-
tion of calcium, magnesium, and potassium (78,82). Forest declines in North America and Europe
have been proposed to be due to aluminum-induced reductions in calcium and magnesium con-
centrations of tree roots and needles (3). Excess aluminum reduced magnesium concentration of
Norway spruce needles to a level considered to be critical for magnesium deﬁciency (3). Also, alu-
minum toxicity reduced calcium and magnesium leaf concentrations in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)
(83).  In  sorghum  (Sorghum  bicolor Moench), magnesium  deﬁciency  was  a  source  of  acid-soil
stress (84).

In the case of phosphorus, concentrations increased in roots but typically decreased in shoots.
In roots of red spruce, 32P accumulation increased but  32P translocation to shoots decreased (85).
Clarkson (86) proposed that there were two interactions between aluminum and phosphorus: (a) an
adsorption–precipitation reaction in the apoplast; and (b) reaction with various organic phosphorus
compounds within the symplasm of the cell. Aluminum and phosphorus were shown to be copre-
cipitated in the apoplast of corn roots, using x-ray microprobe analysis (49). Excised corn roots
exposed to 20 h of 0.1 to 0.5 mM Al had decreased mobile inorganic phosphate (40%), ATP (65%),
and  uridine  diphosphate  glucose  (UDGP)  (65%)  as  shown  by  31P-NMR  (nuclear  magnetic  reso-
nance), indicating  aluminum  interference  with  phosphorus  metabolism  within  the  symplasm
(87,88).

16.5.2.4 Restricted Water Uptake and Transport

Typically, aluminum toxicity decreases water uptake and movement in plants. Stomatal closure of
arabidopsis  occurred  after  9 h  of  exposure  to  100 µM Al  at  pH  4.0  (89).  In  wheat, transpiration
decreased after 28 days of exposure to 148 µM Al (90). Treatment of 1-year-old black spruce (Picea
mariana Britton) with 290 µM Al resulted in wilting and reduced water uptake within 7 days (91).
Hydraulic conductivity of red oak roots was reduced after 48 to 63 days of exposure to aluminum,
although  no  eﬀect  was  observed  after  only  4  days  (92).  In  contrast, transpiration  in  sorghum
increased after 28 days of aluminum treatment (90).

16.5.2.5 Suppressed Photosynthesis

Net photosynthesis is reported to decrease with excess aluminum relative to normal rates. Exposure
to 250 µM Al for 6 to 8 weeks reduced the photosynthetic rate of red spruce, and McCanny et al. (79)
attributed  this  eﬀect  to  an  aluminum-induced  decrease  in  root/shoot  ratio.  Similarly, exposure  of
beech seedlings to 0.37 mM Al for 2 months signiﬁcantly decreased net CO2 assimilation rates (83).

16.5.2.6 Inhibition of Symbiosis with Rhizobia
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation results in release of H⫹, acidiﬁcation of legume pastures, and increased
solubilization of aluminum (2). Excess aluminum has an inhibitory eﬀect on rhizobial symbiosis.
In an Australian pasture, the percentage of plant nitrogen derived from the atmosphere declined in
subterranean  clover  (Trifolium  subterraneum L.)  as  foliar  concentration  of  aluminum  increased
(93). In four tropical pasture legumes, aluminum at ⬎25 µM for 28 days delayed appearance of nod-
ules, decreased percentage of plants that nodulated, and decreased number and dry weight of nod-
ules  (94).  In  phasey-bean  (Macroptilium  lathyroides Urb.)  and  centro  (Centrosema  pubescens
Benth.), nodulation was more sensitive to aluminum toxicity than host plant growth (94).

Aluminum also inhibited the multiplication and nodulating ability of the symbiotic bacterium,
Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii Frank (66). Recent research eﬀorts have focused on identify-
ing aluminum-tolerant rhizobial strains. For example, strains of Bradyrhizobium spp. that were iso-
lated from acid soils were found to more tolerant of 50 µM Al at pH 4.5 than commercial strains (95).

16.6 MECHANISMS OF ALUMINUM TOXICITY IN PLANTS
Controversy exists over mechanisms of aluminum phytotoxic eﬀects (96–99). Researchers long have
debated whether the primary toxic eﬀect of aluminum is on inhibition of cell elongation or inhibi-
tion of cell division. Lazof and Holland (28) demonstrated in soybean, pea (Pisum sativum L.), and
bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that both eﬀects occur, with rapid, largely reversible responses to alu-
minum toxicity due to cell extension eﬀects and irreversible responses due to cell division eﬀects.

Another question puzzling researchers is whether the primary injury due to aluminum in plants
is symplasmic or apoplastic. Horst (100) and Horst et al. (101) reviewed the evidence supporting
the apoplast as the site of the primary aluminum-toxic event. However, dividing aluminum eﬀects
into symplasmic or apoplastic can be arbitrary, because aluminum could enter the symplasm to pro-
duce eﬀects in the cell wall or outer face of the plasma membrane.

Since  cell  walls  occur  in  plants  and  not  animals, aluminum  injuries  at  this  site  are  unique
to plants. Possible mechanisms of aluminum injury in cell walls include: (a) aluminum binding
to pectin; or (b) modiﬁcation of synthesis or deposition of polysaccharides. Jones and Kochian
(102) proposed that the plasma membrane is the most likely site of aluminum toxicity in plants.
Possible mechanisms of toxicity in the plasma membrane are: (a) aluminum binding to phospho-
lipids;  (b)  interference  with  proteins  involved  in  transport;  or  (c)  signal  transduction.  Once
aluminum enters the symplasm, there are many possible interactions with molecules containing
oxygen  donor  ligands  (47,48).  Probable  mechanisms  of  aluminum  toxicity  within  plant  cells
include: (a) disruption of the cytoskeleton, (b) disturbance of calcium homeostasis, (c) interaction
with phytohormones, (d) oxidative stress, (e) binding to internal membranes in chloroplasts, or
(f) binding to nuclei.

16.6.1 CELL WALL
Pectins are a mixture of heterogenous polysaccharides rich in D-galacturonic acid; one major function
is to provide charged structures for ion exchange in cell walls (67). Under acidic conditions, aluminum
binds strongly to negatively charged sites in the root apoplast, sites consisting mostly of free carboxyl
groups on pectins. Klimashevskii and Dedov (103) isolated cell walls from pea roots, exposed them
to aluminum, and found that aluminum decreased plasticity and elasticity of cell walls. Blamey et al.
(104) demonstrated in vitro a rapid sorption of aluminum by calcium pectate and proposed that alu-
minum phytotoxicity is due to strong binding between aluminum and calcium pectate in cell walls.
Reid et al. (105) proposed that aluminum could disrupt normal cell wall growth either by reducing
Ca2⫹ concentration below that required for cross-linking of pectic residues or through formation of
aluminum cross-linkages that alter normal cell wall structure. Using x-ray microanalysis, Godbold and

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 448

448

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Jentschke (106) showed that aluminum displaced calcium and magnesium from root cortical cell walls
of  Norway  spruce.  Using  a  vibrating  calcium-selective  microelectrode, Ryan  and  Kochian  (107)
observed that addition of aluminum commonly resulted in an initial eﬄux of calcium from wheat
roots, probably due to displacement of calcium from cell walls.

Pectin  is  secreted  in  a  highly  esteriﬁed  form  from  the  symplasm  to  the  apoplast, where
demethylation  takes  place  by  pectin  methylesterase  (PME), resulting  in  free  carboxylic  groups
available to bind aluminum (108). Transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) overexpressing PME
is more sensitive to aluminum based on inhibition of root elongation relative to unmodiﬁed control
plants, indicating  that  increased  binding  sites  for  aluminum  in  the  apoplast  are  associated  with
increased aluminum sensitivity (108).

16.6.1.1 Modification of Synthesis or Deposition of Polysaccharides

In  addition  to  external  binding  to  cell  wall  components, aluminum  also  could  interfere  with  the
internal synthesis or deposition of cell wall polysaccharides. Exposure of wheat seedlings to 10 µM
Al for 6 h decreased mechanical extensibility of subsequently isolated cell walls (109). Tabuchi and
Matsumoto (109) showed that aluminum treatment modiﬁed cell wall components, increasing the
molecular mass of hemicellulosic polysaccharides, thus decreasing the viscosity of cell walls, and
perhaps restricting cell wall extensibility.

Uridine diphosphate glucose (UDGP) is the substrate for cellulose synthesis. Using  31P-NMR,
Pfeﬀer et al. (87) demonstrated that a 20-h exposure of excised corn roots to 0.1 mM Al decreased
UDGP by 65%, and they speculated that such suppression could limit production of cell wall poly-
saccharides. In barley, one of the most aluminum-sensitive cereals, callose was excreted from the
junction  between  the  root  cap  and  the  root  epidermis  after  38 min  of  exposure  to  37 µM Al, and
Kaneko et al. (110) proposed that aluminum-induced inhibition of root elongation could be due to
reduced cell wall synthesis caused by a shortage of substrate to form polysaccharides.

16.6.2 PLASMA MEMBRANE

16.6.2.1 Binding to Phospholipids

Biological membranes are composed of phospholipids that contain a phosphate group (67), and alu-
minum  can  bind  to  this  negatively  charged  group.  Using  electron  paramagnetic  resonance  spec-
troscopy, Vierstra  and  Haug  (111)  demonstrated  that  100 mM  Al  at  pH  4  decreased  ﬂuidity  in
membrane lipids of a thermophilic microorganism (Thermoplasma  acidophilum Darland, Brock,
Samsonoﬀ and Conti). Using physiologically signiﬁcant concentrations of aluminum, Deleers et al.
(112) showed that 25 µM Al increased rigidity of membrane vesicles as indicated by the increased
temperature required to maintain a speciﬁc polarization value. In addition, aluminum at ⬍ 30 µM
could induce phase separation of phosphatidylserine (PS; a negatively charged phospholipid) vesi-
cles, as shown by leakage of a ﬂuorescent compound (113).

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in plasma membranes of eukary-
otes, and Akeson et al. (114) showed that in vitro, Al3⫹ has a 560-fold greater aﬃnity for the sur-
face  of  PC  than  Ca2⫹.  Further, Jones  and  Kochian  (102)  found  that  lipids  with  net  negatively
charged head groups such as phosphatidyl inositol (PI) had a much greater aﬃnity for aluminum
than PC with its net neutral head group. Interestingly, Delhaize et al. (115) found that expression of
a wheat cDNA (TaPSS1) encoding for phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) increased in response to
excess  aluminum  in  roots.  Overexpression  of  this  cDNA  conferred  aluminum  resistance  in  one
strain of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) but not in another. In addition, a disruption mutant of the
endogenous yeast CHO1 gene that encodes for PSS was sensitive to aluminum (115).

Aluminum reduced membrane permeability to water as shown by a plasmometric method on
root disks of red oak (116). To remove the confounding eﬀect of aluminum binding to cell walls,
Lee et al. (117) used protoplasts of red beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Within 1 min of exposure to 0.5 mM

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 449

Aluminum

449

Al, volumetric expansion of red beet cells was reduced under hypotonic conditions, and Lee et al.
(117) hypothesized that aluminum could bridge neighboring negatively charged sites on the plasma
membrane, stabilizing the membrane.

Binding  of Al3⫹ to  the  exterior  of  phospholipids  reduces  the  surface  negative  charge  of  mem-
branes. Kinraide et al. (27) proposed that accumulation of aluminum at the negatively charged cell
surface plays a role in rhizotoxicity and that amelioration of aluminum toxicity by cations is due to
reduced  negativity  of  the  cell-surface  electrical  potential  by  charge  screening  or  cation  binding.
Kinraide et al. (27) found a good correlation between the reduction in relative root length of an alu-
minum-sensitive wheat cultivar with aluminum activity as calculated at the membrane surface, but not
in the bulk external solution. Ahn et al. (118) measured the zeta potential (an estimate of surface poten-
tial) of plasma membrane vesicles from squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) roots and showed that aluminum
exposure resulted in a less negative surface potential. Measuring uptake of radioisotopes by barley
roots, Nichol et al. (119) showed that inﬂux of cations (K⫹, NH4
⫹, and Ca2⫹) decreased whereas inﬂux
2⫺) increased in the presence of aluminum. They speculated that binding of
of anions (NO3
Al3⫹ to the exterior of a plasma membrane forms a positively charged layer that retards movement
of cations to the membrane surface and increases movement of anions to the surface.

⫺, HPO4

In contrast, Silva et al. (120) demonstrated that Mg2⫹ was 100-fold more eﬀective than Ca2⫹ in
alleviating aluminum-induced inhibition of soybean taproot elongation. They (120) suggested that
such an eﬀect could not be explained by changes in membrane surface potential and proposed that
the protective eﬀects of Mg could be due to alleviation of aluminum binding to G-protein.

16.6.2.2 Interference with Proteins Involved in Transport

In  addition  to  phospholipids, biological  membranes  are  composed  of  proteins, many  of  which  are
involved in transport functions across the membrane (5,67). Aluminum is reported to interfere with the
uptake of many nutrients, perhaps through interactions with cross-membrane transporters or channels.

16.6.2.2.1 H⫹-ATPases
Transmembrane electric potential (Vm) is the diﬀerence in electric potential between the external
environment and the symplasm; typically, the interior of the cell is negatively charged with respect
to the outside (67). The potential depends on transient ﬂuxes of H⫹ through membrane-bound H⫹-
ATPases, as well as ﬂuxes of K⫹ and other cations through membrane transporters. Measurements
of net H⫹ ﬂux using either a microelectrode or vibrating probe demonstrated that net inward cur-
rents of H⫹ occurred between 0 to 3 mm from root tips of wheat (60,121). Exposure of roots of an
aluminum-sensitive wheat cultivar to 10 µM Al for 1 to 3 h inhibited H⫹ inﬂux; however, there was
no obligatory association between inhibition of H⫹ inﬂux and inhibition of root elongation (60).
Ryan et al. (60) speculated that the H⫹ inﬂux near the root apex could be due to cotransport of H⫹
with unloaded sugars and amino acids into the cytoplasm, or a membrane more permeable to H⫹.
Conducting an in vitro enzyme test, Jones and Kochian (102) found little eﬀect of aluminum on
H⫹-ATPase activity. Similarly, Tu and Brouillette (122) found no eﬀect of aluminum on plasma
membrane-bound ATPase activity in the presence of free ATP; however, exposure of Mg2⫹-ATP to
18 µM Al competitively inhibited hydrolysis of ATP. Based on immunolocalization, H⫹-ATPases in
epidermal and cortical cells (2 to 3 mm from tip) of squash roots decreased after 3 h of exposure to
50 µM Al (118). Similarly, 2 days of exposure to ⱖ 75 µM Al decreased activity of plasma mem-
brane-bound ATPases in 1-cm root tips of ﬁve wheat cultivars (123). Since H⫹-ATPases generate
the proton motive force that drives secondary transporters and channels (5,67), a decrease in activ-
ity of this membrane-bound enzyme could result in an overall decrease in nutrient uptake.

16.6.2.2.2 Potassium Channels
Uptake of K⫹ by pea roots was depressed by aluminum (124). Similarly, exposure of mature root cells
(ⱖ 10 mm from root tip) of an aluminum-sensitive wheat cultivar to 5 µM Al inhibited K⫹ inﬂux (121).
In addition, Reid et al. (105) showed partial inhibition of Rb⫹ (analog for K⫹) uptake by ⬎ 50 µM Al

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 450

450

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

in giant algal (Chara corallina) cells, and they attributed this eﬀect to partial blocking by aluminum of
K⫹ channels. Using the patch-clamp technique on isolated plasma membranes or whole cells from an
aluminum-tolerant corn cultivar, Pineros and Kochian (125) showed that instantaneous outward K⫹
channels were blocked by 12 µM Al, whereas inward K⫹ channels were inhibited by 400 µM Al.

A strong dysfunction in K⫹ ﬂuxes between guard cells and epidermal cells was observed in
beech (Betula spp.) seedlings exposed to excess aluminum for 2 months (83). Measuring currents
of  inside-out  membrane  patches  from  fava  bean  (Vicia  faba L.)  guard  cells, Liu  and  Luan  (41)
demonstrated  that  the  K⫹ inward  rectifying  channel  (KIRC)  was  inhibited  by  50 µM  Al  when
exposed on the inward-facing side of the membrane. They (41) proposed that calcium channels con-
duct Al3⫹ across the plasma membrane because, verapamil, a Ca2⫹ channel blocker, prevented alu-
minum-induced inhibition of KIRC in the whole cell conﬁguration. In addition, Liu and Luan (41)
expressed the gene, KAT1, which encodes for a KIRC, in Xenopus oocytes, injected aluminum into
the cytoplasm, and observed inhibition of the KAT1 current.

16.6.2.2.3 Calcium Channels
Uptake by roots and translocation of 45Ca to shoots was decreased in wheat by 100 µM Al (126).
Similar results occurred with 4-week-old Norway spruce seedlings, in which uptake of 45Ca was
reduced by 77 to 92% by 100 to 800 µM Al (3). Net Ca2⫹ inﬂux was highest between 0 and 2 mm
from  the  root  apex  of  wheat, based  on  a  calcium-selective  vibrating  microelectrode  (127).
Addition  of  20 µM Al  to  roots  of  an  aluminum-sensitive  wheat  cultivar  resulted  in  a  dramatic
decrease in Ca2⫹ inﬂux, and this eﬀect was attributed to blockage by aluminum of a putative cal-
cium channel (128). However, Ryan and Kochian (107) did not  ﬁnd an obligatory relationship
between inhibition of calcium uptake and reduction of root growth in wheat. Similarly, in Chara
corallina cells, aluminum inhibited calcium inﬂux by less than 50% at 100 µM Al, and Reid et al.
(105)  thought  it  unlikely  that  such  a  small  degree  of  inhibition  would  be  suﬃcient  to  inhibit
growth so rapidly.

16.6.2.2.4 Magnesium Transporters
Exposure of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiﬂorum Lam.) to 6.6 µM Al competitively inhibited net
Mg2⫹ uptake (129). Interestingly, McDiarmid and Gardner (130) isolated two yeast genes, ALR1
and  ALR2, that  encode  proteins  homologous  to  bacterial  Mg2⫹ and  Co2⫹ transport  systems.
Overexpression of these genes conferred increased tolerance to Al3⫹, indicating that aluminum tox-
icity in yeast is related to reduced Mg2⫹ inﬂux (130).

16.6.2.2.5 Nitrate Uptake
In white clover, 3 weeks of exposure to 50 µM Al inhibited nitrate uptake as measured by nitrogen
⫺ inﬂuxes were reduced within 30 min
content in plants (131). In all regions of soybean roots, 15NO3
of exposure to 80 µM Al (132). In corn, 30 min of exposure to 100 µM Al decreased NO3
⫺ uptake
as measured by NO3-N depletion in solution, but aluminum-induced inhibition of root elongation
was not attributed to inhibition of nitrate uptake (133). Aluminum treatment for 3 days followed by
⫺ uptake in soybean at ⱖ 44 µM Al
measurement of 15NO3
⫺ uptake at aluminum levels below 10 µM, probably as a result of Al3⫹ amelio-
but increased 15NO3
ration of H⫹ toxicity (24).

⫺ uptake in the ﬁnal hour decreased 15NO3

16.6.2.2.6 Iron Uptake
Iron acquisition in Strategy II plants (gramineous plants) involves secretion of mugineic acids (MA)
and uptake of MA–Fe3⫹ complexes (67). Chang et al. (134) demonstrated that exposure to 100 mM
Al for 21 h depressed biosynthesis and secretion of 2′-deoxymugineic acid in wheat.

16.6.2.2.7 Water Channels
Aluminum is reported to reduce permeability of the plasma membrane to water, perhaps through
reduced aquaporin (water channel) activity. Milla et al. (135) found that expression of a rye (Secale
cereale L.) gene encoding for aquaporin (water channel) was decreased by aluminum.

Aluminum

16.6.2.3 Signal Transduction

451

16.6.2.3.1 Interference with Phosphoinositide Signal Transduction
Under in vitro conditions, aluminum interacted strongly with the phosphoinositide signal transduc-
tion element, the plasma-membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (136). In
animals, cleavage of the plasma membrane lipid, PIP2, by phospholipase C (PLC) releases inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) into the cytoplasm. Then, IP3 could produce a signaling cascade by binding
to a Ca2⫹ channel and releasing Ca2⫹ into the cytosol. In microsomal membranes of wheat roots,
aluminum ⱖ 20 µM dramatically inhibited PLC activity (136). Under in vitro conditions, aluminum
was shown to block the PLC-activated cleavage of PIP2 to IP3 (136).

16.6.2.3.2 Transduction of Aluminum Signal
Cell wall-associated kinases could serve as a connecting molecule between the cell wall and the
cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. These kinases span the plasma membrane, with the extracellular portion
covalently bound to pectin in the cell wall and the cytoplasmic portion containing kinase activity.
Recently, expression of a cell wall associated kinase (WAK1) in arabidopsis was induced within 3 h
of exposure to aluminum (89). Sivaguru et al. (89) hypothesized that WAK1 could be involved in
the aluminum signal transduction pathway.

16.6.3 SYMPLASM

16.6.3.1 Disruption of the Cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton is a network of ﬁlamentous protein polymers that permeates the cytoplasm, pro-
viding structural stability and motility for macromolecules and organelles (67). In plants, there are
two major families of proteins: actin and tubulin (67). Actin binds and hydrolyzes the nucleotide,
ATP, during polymerization to form microﬁlaments. Proteins α- and β-tubulin bind and hydrolyze
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) during polymerization to form microtubules.

Actin ﬁlaments are important in cytoplasmic streaming in giant algal cells. With an alga (Vaucheria
longicaulis Hoppaugh), Alessa and Oliveira (137) demonstrated that cytoplasmic streaming of chloro-
plasts and mitochondria (mediated by microﬁlaments) decreased within 30 s of aluminum exposure and
completely ceased within 3 min. Using suspension-cultured soybean cells, Grabski and Schindler (138)
demonstrated that aluminum rapidly increased rigidity of the transvacuolar actin network, and they pro-
posed that the cytoskeleton is the primary target of aluminum toxicity in plants. Grabski et al. (139)
hypothesized that phosphorylated sites on myosin or other actin-binding proteins could bind aluminum,
preventing  access  to  phosphatases  and  resulting  in  a  stabilized  actin  network.  Alternatively, they
hypothesized  that  a  calcium-dependent  phosphatase  could  be  inhibited  directly  by  aluminum.
Interestingly, aluminum toxicity in wheat causes increased expression of a gene encoding for a ﬁmbrin-
like (actin-binding) protein involved in maintenance of cytoskeletal function (140). They speculated
that the increased tension of cytoskeletal actin by aluminum (138) could involve cross-linking of actin
ﬁlaments by ﬁmbrins, leading to increased ﬁmbrin gene expression.

Aluminum  could  disrupt  microtubule  assembly  and  disassembly  through  inhibition  of  GTP
hydrolysis and reduced sensitivity to regulatory signals from Ca2⫹. When magnesium concentra-
tions were below 1.0 mM, MacDonald et al. (141) demonstrated in vitro that 4 ⫻ 10⫺10 M Al could
replace Mg2⫹ in polymerization of tubulin. Disappearance of microtubules was observed sometimes
in cells of the EZ of aluminum-treated (3 h, 50 µM Al) wheat roots (61). In outer cortical cells of
the  DTZ  of  aluminum-sensitive  corn  roots, microtubules  disappeared  within  1 h  of  exposure  to
90 µM Al (142). Treatment of corn roots with 50 µM Al for 3 h resulted in random or obliquely ori-
ented microtubules in inner cortical cells compared to the transverse orientation of those from con-
trol roots (57). In addition, a 1 h pretreatment with aluminum prevented auxin-induced reorientation
of microtubules in inner cortical cells of corn, and Blancafor et al. (57) proposed that aluminum
induced  greater  stabilization  of  microtubules.  Microﬁlaments  seemed  to  be  less  sensitive  to  alu-
minum toxicity, with random arrays detectable in the inner cortical cells after 6 h (57).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

16.6.3.2 Disturbance of Calcium Homeostasis

Siegel and Haug (143) proposed that the primary biochemical injury due to aluminum was caused by
aluminum  complexes  with  calmodulin  (a  calcium-dependent, regulatory  protein).  Similarly, Rengel
(144) proposed that aluminum is the primary environmental signal, with Ca2⫹ as the secondary mes-
senger  that  triggers  aluminum-toxic  events  in  plant  cells.  Using  a  ﬂuorescent  calcium-binding  dye,
Fura 2, Lindberg and Strid (145) showed that exposure of wheat root protoplasts to 50 µM Al caused a
transient and oscillating increase in cytoplasmic Ca2⫹ concentration. Similarly, using a cytosolic cal-
cium indicator dye, Fluo-3, in intact wheat apical cells, Zhang and Rengel (146) showed an increase in
cytoplasmic Ca2⫹ after 1 h treatment with 50 µM Al. Using Fluo-3 and an indicator of membrane-bound
Ca2⫹, chlorotetracycline (CTC), Nichol and Oliveira (147) found increased calcium concentration in
the zone of elongation of an aluminum-sensitive barley cultivar. Since aluminum is known to block cal-
cium channels that allow calcium to move into the cytoplasm, Nichol and Oliveira (147) suggested that
Ca2⫹ was released from intracellular storage sites. Interestingly, aluminum-induced callose formation,
a rapid marker of aluminum toxicity, is always preceded by elevated cytoplasmic Ca2⫹ (67).

In contrast, Jones et al. (148) used the ﬂuorescent dye, Indo-1, and showed a rapid reduction in
cytosolic Ca2⫹ in suspension cultures of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cells. They (148) attrib-
uted this eﬀect to blockage of calcium channels in the plasma membrane by aluminum.

16.6.3.3 Interaction with Phytohormones

The spatial separation between the most aluminum-sensitive site, the DTZ, and the root region that
exhibits reduced cell elongation, the EZ, indicates that a signaling pathway is involved. Perhaps, the
phytohormones, auxin (IAA) or cytokinin, are involved in the transduction of an aluminum-stress
signal.

16.6.3.3.1 Auxin
Corn roots were observed to curve away from unilaterally applied aluminum (149). Similar results
were found for snapbean roots that curved away from an agar surface containing aluminum (52).
Hasenstein and Evans (150) showed that aluminum inhibited basipetal transport of indoleacetic acid
(IAA), perhaps resulting in the tropic root response. Kollmeier et al. (151) conﬁrmed this result,
showing that exogenous 3H-IAA application to the meristematic zone of corn roots with aluminum
application  to  the  DTZ  resulted  in  decreased  basipetal  transport  of  auxin  to  the  EZ.  They  also
showed that exogenous IAA application to the EZ partially ameliorated the aluminum-induced (Al
applied to DTZ) inhibition of root elongation. Kollmeier et al. (151) hypothesized that aluminum
inhibition of auxin transport mediated the aluminum signal between the DTZ and EZ. Sivaguru et al.
(74) speculated that aluminum-induced callose in plasmodesmata could be a primary factor in alu-
minum inhibition of root growth through disturbance of auxin transport.

16.6.3.3.2 Cytokinin
Bean root elongation was inhibited after 360 min of exposure to 6.5 µM Al (152). Ethylene evolu-
tion as well as the level of zeatin (a cytokinin) from root tips increased after 5 min of aluminum
exposure. Massot et al. (152) suggested a role for cytokinin and ethylene in transduction of alu-
minum-induced stress signal.

16.6.3.4 Oxidative Stress

Aluminum is redox inactive and is not able to initiate oxidation of lipids or proteins on its own. Yet,
lipid peroxidation has been observed in barley roots after 3 h incubation with aluminum (100 µM
AICI3, pH, 4.3) (153). Similarly, in pea roots, increase of lipid peroxidation and inhibition of root
elongation occurred after 4 h of exposure to 10 µM aluminium (154). Sakihama and Yamasaki (153)
proposal that aluminum stabilizes the oxidized form of phenolics (normally unstable), resulting in
phenoxyl radicals that initiate lipid peroxidation. Alternatively, aluminum could increase formation

of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell defense against ROS includes the enzymes, superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (PX), which reduce ROS (153). If levels of these enzymes
are not suﬃcient, then ROS could lead to oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA, and even cell death.
In corn, 24 h of exposure to aluminum increased activities of SOD and PX, and increased protein
oxidation in the aluminum-sensitive genotype (155).

Another possibility proposed by Ikegawa et al. (156) is aluminum-enhanced, Fe(II)-medicated
peroxidation of lipids as a cause of cell death. Exposure of tobacco suspension cultures to aluminum
alone for 24 h resulted in aluminum accumulation but no signiﬁcant cell death (156). Addition of
Fe(II) (a redox active metal) to cells with accumulated aluminum after 12 h resulted in enhanced
lipid peroxidation and cell death. Lipid peroxidation does not appear to be the mechanism involved
in  reduction  of  root  elongation  (154).  In  pea  roots, treatment  with  an  antioxidant  prevented
aluminum-enhanced lipid peroxidation, reduced callose formation, but did not prevent aluminum-
induced inhibition of root elongation (154).

Interestingly, three of four cDNA up-regulated by aluminum stress in Arabidopsis thaliana encoded
genes  were  induced  also  by  oxidative  stress  (157).  Similarly, the  vast  majority  of  isolated  cDNAs,
whose expression increased in response to aluminum toxicity in sugarcane (Saccharum oﬃcinarum L.),
showed greater expression in response to oxidative stress (158). These results indicate that oxidative
stress is an important component of the plant’s response to aluminum toxicity. Overexpression of a
tobacco gene encoding for glutathione S-transferase (parB) in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred a degree
of aluminum resistance as well as resistance to oxidative stress induced by diamide, providing genetic
evidence of a linkage between aluminum stress and oxidative stress in plants (159).

16.6.3.5 Binding to Internal Membranes in Chloroplasts
As discussed earlier, one long-term eﬀect of aluminum toxicity is the suppression of photosynthetic
ﬁxation of isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts
activity (79,90). Photosynthetic 14CO2
was inhibited by 10 µM Al at pH 7 (160). Hampp and Schnabel (160) attributed this eﬀect to damage
of the membrane system. Aluminum exposure of wheat for 14 days decreased the maximum photo-
chemical yield Fv/Fm of photosystem II, (ratio of variable ﬂuorescence over maximum ﬂuorescence,
as measured by a ﬂuorometer) (161). Moustakas and Ouzounidou (161) attributed this eﬀect to loss
of Ca2⫹, Mg2⫹, and K⫹ from chloroplasts. Seventy days of aluminum exposure decreased Fv/F0, or the
ratio of variable ﬂuorescence over initial ﬂuorescence (162). Pereira et al. (162) speculated that this
decrease was an indicator of aluminum-induced structural damage in the thylakoids. In the cyanobac-
terium, Anabaena cylindrica Lemm., aluminum was found to degrade thylakoid membranes (163).

16.6.3.6 Binding to Nuclei

Aluminum entered soybean root cells and was associated with nuclei only after 30 min of exposure
to 1.45 µM Al (164). In corn root tips, high chromatin fragmentation and loss of plasma membrane
integrity occurred after 48 h exposure to 36 µM Al (155). However, Al3⫹ binding to DNA is very
weak and cannot compete with phosphate, ATP, or other organic ligands such as citrate (47,48).
Martin (47) stated that the observed association of aluminum with nuclear chromatin must be due
to its complexation to other ligands and not to DNA.

16.7 GENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN ALUMINUM RESPONSE OF PLANTS
Comparative studies of aluminum eﬀects in 22 species in seven plant families have established that
some species or genotypes within species can resist aluminum toxicity (82). Foy (165) proposed
‘tailoring  the  plant  to  ﬁt  the  soil;  in  other  words, he  suggested  that  it  was  more  economical  to
develop mineral-stress-resistant plants than to correct the soil for nutrient deﬁciencies or toxicities.
This statement is particularly true for acid subsoils, where it is not economically feasible to lime at
such depths, or for developing countries, where farmers cannot aﬀord the high-input costs of lime.

16.7.1 SCREENING TESTS
Screening for genotypic diﬀerences in response to aluminum toxicity can be conducted in pots or
in ﬁelds with aluminum-toxic soil. A more rapid screening test for diﬀerences in aluminum toler-
ance among species or genotypes within species utilizes the aluminum-induced inhibition of root
elongation as a measure of aluminum sensitivity (166). These tests are conducted with varying lev-
els of aluminum in solution at an acid pH (ⱕ 4.5) to maintain a high activity of Al3⫹, the phytotoxic
ion. Some researchers have found a poor correlation between plant responses in soil with those in
nutrient solution (167). Others have found a good correlation (168–171).

Hematoxylin stains extracellular aluminum phosphate compounds that result from aluminum
damage to root cells (172). Another quick screening test is to stain roots grown in an aluminum-
containing solution with hematoxylin and to assess the intensity of staining (173). With wheat, Scott
et al. (174) found a good agreement between root elongation results and those using hematoxylin.
However, Bennet (175) warned that many aspects of hematoxylin staining are not well understood
and that aluminum-treated roots do not always respond to hematoxylin even when symptoms of alu-
minum toxicity occurred. Further, sometimes roots will stain in the absence of aluminum (175).

Moore et al. (176) proposed that recovery of root elongation after 48 h of exposure to aluminum
is  a  better  measure  of  irreversible  damage  to  the  root  apical  meristem.  Hecht-Buchholz  (177)
reported that aluminum toxicity in barley caused stunted roots, destruction of root cap cells, swelling,
and destruction of both root epidermal and cortical cells. She found large diﬀerences between culti-
vars  and  proposed  that  aluminum  resistance  could  be  attributed  to  greater  resistance  of  the  root
meristem of the aluminum-tolerant genotype to irreversible destruction. Lazof and Holland (28) sug-
gested that root recovery experiments in soybean, pea, and snapbean allowed separation of H⫹ toxi-
city eﬀects from Al3⫹ toxicity eﬀects. Zhang et al. (178) showed that root regrowth after aluminum
stress could be used to improve aluminum tolerance in triticale (Triticosecale spp.).

16.7.2 GENETICS
Aluminum tolerance is a heritable trait in sorghum (179), barley (180), wheat (181,182), rice (Oryza
sativa L.) (183), soybean (184), and Arabidopsis thaliana (185). With sorghum, Magalhaes (cited in
179) has found a pattern of inheritance of aluminum tolerance that is consistent with a single locus.
With barley, Tang et al. (180) conﬁrmed that aluminum tolerance segregation in F2 genotypes was due
to a single gene, Alp, and they proposed the use of molecular markers in selection of aluminum toler-
ance in barley genotypes without the need for ﬁeld trials, soil bioassays, or solution culture tests. In
wheat, controversy exists over the number and location of genes that are involved in aluminum toler-
ance (181,182). In rice, nine diﬀerent genomic regions on eight chromosomes have been associated
with genetic control of plant response to aluminum, indicating that aluminum tolerance is a multigenic
trait (183). Similarly, with soybean, aluminum tolerance is likely to be governed by 3 to 5 genes (184).
In Arabidopsis, two quantitative trait loci occurring on two chromosomes could account for 43% of
total variability in aluminum tolerance among a recombinant inbred population (185).  A recent review
of genetic analysis of aluminum tolerance in plants is found in Kochian et al. (179).

16.8 PLANT MECHANISMS OF ALUMINUM AVOIDANCE OR TOLERANCE
There  are  two  types  of  mechanisms  whereby  a  plant  can  avoid  or  tolerate  aluminum  toxicity:
(a) exclusion of aluminum from the symplasm, or (b) internal tolerance of aluminum in the sym-
plasm. Good reviews on this subject are in Taylor (186,187), Matsumoto (99), Kochian et al. (179,
188), and Barcelo and Poschenrieder (96).

16.8.1 PLANT MECHANISMS OF ALUMINUM AVOIDANCE
Based on chemical analysis of aluminum in root sections, Horst et al. (189) showed that the root
tips of an aluminum-tolerant cultivar of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp.) had a lower aluminum

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 455

Aluminum

455

concentration  than  those  of  an  aluminum-sensitive  cultivar, suggesting  that  reduced  aluminum
absorption into the root tip was responsible for its higher aluminum tolerance. Using direct meas-
urement of aluminum with atomic absorption spectrophotometry or ion chromatography, Rincon
and Gonzales (190) showed that aluminum content was 9 to 13 times greater in the 0-to-2-mm root
tips of an aluminum-sensitive wheat cultivar than in an aluminum-tolerant cultivar. Similar results
were reported by Delhaize et al. (191), who showed using x-ray microanalysis that aluminum-sen-
sitive wheat root apices accumulated 5 to 10 times greater aluminum than aluminum-tolerant root
apices.

These results indicate that aluminum exclusion occurs in several plant species. Possible mech-
anisms  of  aluminum  avoidance  include: (a)  root  avoidance  response, (b)  organic  acid  release,
(c) exudation of phosphate, (d) exudation of polypeptides, (e) exudation of phenolics, (f) alkalinization
of rhizosphere pH, (g) binding to mucilage, (h) binding to cell walls, (i) binding to external face of
membrane, and (j) interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.

16.8.1.1 Avoidance Response of Roots

Classic avoidance response of roots to aluminum toxicity was shown by research (149) in which
corn roots curved away from aluminum applied to one side of root. Also, aluminum toxicity killed
cells in the corn root apical meristem, and Boscolo et al. (155) speculated that this phenomenon
would  result  in  loss  of  apical  dominance  and  greater  lateral  root  growth  into  environments  with
lower aluminum levels. Interestingly, taproots of corn cv. SA-6 and soybean cv. Perry did not pen-
etrate much into an aluminum-toxic subsoil layer, although lateral root lengths increased in the non-
toxic top soil layer (192). However, although increased lateral root growth in topsoil layers could
help  to  maintain  crop  yields  in  areas  with  acid  subsoils, under  drought  conditions, lack  of  root
growth into deeper layers could limit water uptake.

16.8.1.2 Organic Acid Release

Considerable evidence supports organic acid release as a mechanism of aluminum avoidance in
plants (179,188,193,194). Hue et al. (195) used elongation of cotton (Gossypium  hirsutum L.)
taproots as a measure of aluminum toxicity to document the aluminum detoxiﬁcation eﬀect of
several low-molecular-weight organic acids or anions. The relative ameliorative capacity of the
organic acids followed closely the stability constants of the aluminum–organic acid complexes in
the order:

Citric ⬎ Oxalic ⬎ Tartaric ⬎ Malic ⬎ Acetic

The formation of stable rings (5-, 6-, and to a lesser extent 7-membered structures) between alu-
minum  and  organic  anions  or  molecules  seems  to  be  responsible  for  the  detoxiﬁcation  (195).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

The  ﬁrst evidence of aluminum-induced root exudation of an organic acid was identiﬁed in
snapbean, in  which  an  aluminum-tolerant  cultivar  exuded  ten  times  as  much  citrate  as  an  alu-
minum-sensitive cultivar in the presence of aluminum (196). Aluminum-induced root release of
malate  was  characterized  thoroughly  in  wheat  by  Delhaize  and  co-workers  (197–200).  They
showed that exposure of an aluminum-tolerant genotype to 10 µM Al induced malate exudation
from roots within 15 min. Wheat root apices contained suﬃcient malate for excretion for over 4 h
(198). After  24 h  of  exposure  to  100 µM Al, de  novo  synthesis  of  malate  was  demonstrated  by
measuring  14C incorporation into malate (199). The eﬄux of malate from root apices was elec-
troneutral, because it was accompanied by an eﬄux of K⫹ (198). Evaluating 36 wheat cultivars,
Ryan et al. (200) showed a signiﬁcant correlation between relative tolerance of wheat genotypes
to  aluminum  and  amount  of  malate  released  from  root  apices.  Other  researchers  have  argued
against the eﬀectiveness of malate exudation on alleviating aluminum toxicity because of rapid
degradation by soil microorganisms (201) and the low concentrations and relatively weak chelat-
ing ability of malate for aluminum (202).

Other plant species have been shown to exude organic acids in response to aluminum stress.
Aluminum-tolerant corn genotypes exuded higher concentrations of citrate (203). An aluminum-
tolerant tree species, Senna tora Roxb. (formerly Cassia tora), exuded citric acid after 4 h of expo-
sure  to  50 µM Al  (204).  In  rye, after  10 h  of  exposure  to  10 µM Al, increased  activity  of  citrate
synthase (CS) occurred along with increased citrate secretion (205). In all soybean genotypes, cit-
rate  exudation  increased  within  6 h  of  aluminum  exposure;  however, only  citrate  eﬄux  in  alu-
minum-tolerant genotypes was sustained for an extended time period (206). A positive correlation
was found between citrate in root tips of soybean and aluminum tolerance (206). The aluminum-
accumulating plant, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), was found to exude oxalate, a
strong aluminum chelator (207). Taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott), a tropical root crop that is not
an  aluminum  accumulator, also  exuded  oxalate  from  roots  in  response  to  aluminum  (208).
Aluminum-resistant mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana constitutively released higher concentrations
of citrate or malate compared to the wild type (209). A mutant carrot (Daucus carota L.) cell line
that solubilized phosphate from aluminum phosphate exuded citrate from roots (210). This cell line
had a greater activity of mitochondrial CS and a lower activity of a cytoplasmic enzyme, NADP-
speciﬁc isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH), involved in citrate degradation (211,212).

Anion channels are involved in the aluminum-activated exudation of organic anions. Using elec-
trophysiology to measure current passing across whole apical cells of wheat roots, Ryan et al. (213)
showed that 20 to 50 µM Al activated an anion channel. Genotypic diﬀerences were found with the
aluminum-induced currents across protoplasts from the aluminum-tolerant wheat genotype occurring
more  frequently  and  being  sustained  for  a  longer  period  of  time  than  those  from  the  aluminum-
sensitive  genotype  (214).  Using  subtractive  hybridization  of  cDNAs  from  near-isogenic  lines  of
aluminum-sensitive and aluminum-tolerant wheat, Sasaki et al. (215) found greater expression of a
gene  that  cosegregated  with  aluminum  tolerance.  Heterologous  expression  of  this  gene, named
ALMT1 (aluminum-activated malate transporter), in Xenopus oocytes, rice, and cultured tobacco cells
conferred an aluminum-activated malate efflux, and enhanced the ability of tobacco cells to recover
from 18 h of exposure to 100 µM AI (215). Transgenic barley cultivars with the ALMT1 transgene
showed increased malate effux and increased root grwoth at concentrations up to 12 µM AI (216).

Another means of increasing aluminum tolerance in plants is to increase synthesis as well as exu-
dation  of  organic  acids.  De  la  Fuente  et  al.  (217)  overexpressed  a  CS  gene  from  the  bacterium,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Migula, in the cytoplasm of transgenic tobacco and found increased cit-
rate  levels  within  roots, increased  citrate  eﬄux, and  increased  root  elongation  in  the  presence
of ⱖ 100 µM Al. However, Delhaize et al. (218) were unsuccessful in repeating this work (217), and
they suggested that the activity of P. aeruginosa cytoplasmic CS in transgenic tobacco is either sen-
sitive  to  environmental  conditions, or  that  the  improved  aluminum  tolerance  observed  by  de  la
Fuente et al. (217) was due to other factors. Koyama et al. (219) overexpressed a mitochondrial CS
gene, isolated  from  carrot, in  Arabidopsis  thaliana and  found  increased  CS  activity, increased

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 457

excretion of citrate, and slightly increased amelioration of aluminum toxicity based on root elon-
gation at pH 5.

Tesfaye et al. (220) overexpressed genes for nodule-enhanced forms of the enzymes that cat-
alyze  malate  synthesis, phosphoenolpyruvate  carboxylase  and  malate  dehydrogenase  in  alfalfa
(Medicago sativa L.). They found increased enzyme activities, increased root exudation of organic
acids (citrate, oxalate, malate, succinate, and acetate), and increased root elongation in the presence
of 50 to 100 µM Al. However, such root exudation represented a drain of plant resources, and trans-
genic lines had reduced biomass compared to untransformed control plants when grown at soil pH
7.25. In acid soils, however, transgenic alfalfa had 1.6 times greater biomass than untransformed
control plants.

Although abundant evidence exists for aluminum-induced organic acid excretion as a mecha-
nism  of  aluminum  tolerance, other  mechanisms  probably  exist.  Ishikawa  et  al.  (221)  found  no
correlation between species or within species for organic acid exudation and aluminum tolerance.
Similarly, Wenzl et al. (222) reported that the greater aluminum tolerance of signalgrass (Urochloa
decumbens R.D.  Webster, formerly  Brachiaria  decumbens)  relative  to  ruzigrass  (Urochloa
ruziziensis Crins, formerly  Brachiaria  ruziziensis)  was  not  due  to  greater  exudation  of  organic
acids.

16.8.1.3 Exudation of Phosphate

Root  apices  of  an  aluminum-tolerant  genotype  of  wheat  exuded  phosphate  as  well  as  citrate  in
response  to  aluminum  exposure  (223).  Pellet  et  al.  (223)  speculated  that  phosphate  release  con-
tributed to aluminum tolerance in wheat. In contrast, no major diﬀerences in phosphate release were
found among near-isogenic lines of wheat that diﬀered in aluminum tolerance (224).

16.8.1.4 Exudation of Polypeptides

Aluminum-resistant lines of wheat exuded an aluminum-induced 23 kDa polypeptide (225). This
polypeptide, synthesized de novo in response to aluminum, binds aluminum, and cosegregates with
the aluminum-resistant phenotype in F2 populations (225,226). The gene encoding this polypeptide
still needs to be isolated.

16.8.1.5 Exudation of Phenolics

Phenolics are aromatic secondary metabolites of plants (e.g., quercetin, catechin, morin, or chloro-
genic acid) that can bind aluminum (67,227). Silicon ameliorates aluminum toxicity in some plants
(228, 229). In an aluminum-resistant corn cultivar, silicon and aluminum triggered the release of
phenolic compounds (e.g., catechol, catechin, and quercetin) up to 15 times the release by plants
not pretreated with silicon (230). However, the binding capacity of many of these phenolic com-
pounds for aluminum is greater at pH 7 than at pH 4.5 (227).

16.8.1.6 Alkalinization of Rhizosphere

The solubility of aluminum is dependent on pH; as pH rises above 5.0, precipitation of aluminum
as Al(OH)3 increases (Figure 16.1). An aluminum-tolerant wheat cultivar grown in a nutrient solution
increased the pH, whereas an aluminum-sensitive cultivar lowered the solution pH (231). Foy et al.
(231)  proposed  that  aluminum  tolerance  is  associated  with  plant-induced  alkalinization  of  pH.
However, rhizosphere pH associated with apical root tissues did not appear to be a primary mecha-
nism  of  diﬀerential  aluminum  tolerance  in  wheat.  The  root  apex  of  an  aluminum-tolerant  wheat
genotype had only a slightly higher rhizosphere pH in the presence of aluminum than an aluminum-
sensitive genotype, resulting in a 6% decrease in free Al3⫹ activity (121). Yet the aluminum-tolerant
wheat  genotype  had  140%  greater  relative  root  elongation  compared  to  the  aluminum-sensitive

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 458

458

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

genotype, indicating that rhizosphere pH did not play a major role in diﬀerential aluminum tolerance
(121). In contrast, Degenhardt et al. (232) reported that aluminum exposure induced a doubling in net
H⫹ inﬂux  at  the  root  tip  of  an  aluminum-resistant  Arabidopsis mutant  relative  to  the  wild-type,
increasing pH by 0.15 units. Although the pH diﬀerence was small, solution pH maintained at 4.5 was
shown to increase Arabidopsis root growth relative to that at pH 4.4.

16.8.1.7 Binding to Mucilage

Horst et al. (233) reported that mucilage from root tips of cowpea had a high binding capacity for
aluminum  and  that  removal  of  this  mucilage  resulted  in  greater  inhibition  of  root  elongation  by
aluminum. They proposed that mucilage served to protect the apical meristem against aluminum
injury. Similarly, Brigham et al. (234) showed that removal of snapbean mucilage (including root
border cells) resulted in reduced root elongation and greater aluminum accumulation in root tips as
shown by lumogallion staining. Pan et al. (777) demonstrated that the presence of mucilage and bor-
der cells in wheat reduced aluminum injury to root meristems, as shown by a greater mitotic index.
In contrast, Li et al. (235) found that although mucilage from corn root apices binds strongly to alu-
minum, the presence or absence of mucilage did not aﬀect aluminum-induced inhibition of root
elongation.

16.8.1.8 Binding to Cell Walls

Some researchers observed that root cation exchange capacity (CEC) of Al-tolerant genotypes were
lower than that of aluminum-sensitive ones (236); however, other researchers found no such corre-
lation (237,238). Interestingly, a transgenic potato overexpressing PME exhibited greater activity of
PME (which should result in more free carboxylic groups in cell walls), greater aluminum accu-
mulation in root tips, and greater sensitivity to aluminum as shown by aluminum-induced callose
formation and inhibition of root elongation (108). These results suggest that genotypic diﬀerences
in number of negatively charged binding sites in the cell wall could result in diﬀerential aluminum
tolerance.

Interestingly, overexpression of WAK1 in arabidopsis conferred increased aluminum tolerance
as shown by increased root elongation in the presence of aluminum (89). Sivaguru et al. (89) spec-
ulated that WAKs could interact with cell wall components such as callose or pectins, alleviating
aluminum  toxicity. Alternatively, they  speculated  that  the  cytoplasmic  kinase  domain  could  be
cleaved oﬀ from WAKs and participate in cytoplasmic aluminum response pathways.

16.8.1.9 Binding to External Face of Plasma Membrane
Among ﬁve plant species diﬀering in aluminum tolerance, the zeta potential (i.e., an estimate of
plasma  membrane  surface  potential)  was  higher  (membrane  surface  less  negative)  in  aluminum-
resistant plant species than in sensitive ones (239). Wagatsuma and Akiba (239) hypothesized that
aluminum-sensitive plant species had more negative charges on the plasma membrane, resulting in
greater aluminum-binding to its surface. Similarly, Ishikawa and Wagatsuma (240) pretreated pro-
toplasts of four plant species with aluminum for 10 min followed by a hypotonic aluminum-free
solution. They found that protoplasts from aluminum-sensitive species exhibited greater leakage of
K⫹ and  proposed  that  aluminum  binding  to  plasma  membrane  induced  greater  rigidity, reduced
extensibility, and increased leakage under hypotonic conditions.

In contrast, Yermiyahu et al. (241) found that the surface-charge density of vesicles isolated
from an aluminum-sensitive wheat cultivar was 26% more negative than those from an aluminum-
tolerant wheat cultivar. However, they (241) argued that this small diﬀerence in surface-charge den-
sity did not account for the large diﬀerence in sensitivity to aluminum (50%).

16.8.1.10 Interactions with Mycorrhizal Fungi
Conﬂicting reports occur in the literature with a few researchers  ﬁnding negative or no eﬀect of
mycorrhizal colonization on host-response to aluminum toxicity (242–245) and a greater number
showing a beneﬁcial eﬀect of colonization with either ectomycorrhizal (ECT) (246,247) or arbus-
cular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (248–250). Host response to aluminum toxicity depended on the
species of ECT (242) or AMF (243). Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) colonized by an aluminum-
sensitive ECT fungus (Hebeloma cf. longicaudum Kumm. ss. Lange) exhibited decreased shoot and
root biomass compared to nonmycorrhizal plants in the presence of 2500 µM Al (242). In contrast,
Scots pine colonized by an aluminum-tolerant ECT fungus (Laccaria bicolor Orton) had greater
shoot and root biomass, greater shoot P, and lower shoot aluminum compared to nonmycorrhizal
plants in the presence of 740 µM Al (242). Similarly, only ﬁve of eight isolates of AMF increased
growth of switchgrass and reduced foliar Al concentrations in an acid soil (243).

Pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) colonized with the ECT fungus, Pisolithus tinctorius Coker and
Couch, had greater shoot and root biomass at 50 to 200 µM Al than noninoculated plants (246).
Colonization of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) with the ECT fungus, P. tinctorius, resulted in greater
shoot dry weight, height, and needle length relative to nonmycorrhizal seedlings at aluminum lev-
els ⱖ 460 µM (247). Schier and McQuattie (247) attributed the beneﬁcial eﬀects of ECT fungi to
reduced aluminum concentrations and higher phosphorus concentrations in needles.

Colonization of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) with the AMF, Glomus occultum Walker,
resulted in higher total shoot biomass at 500 µM Al as well as lower tissue aluminum and higher
calcium concentrations (248). In an aluminum-sensitive barley cultivar, colonization with the AMF,
Glomus etunicatum Becker and Gerdemann, resulted in greater shoot biomass and greater P con-
centrations in shoots and roots at 600 µM Al (249). Colonization of tissue-cultured banana (Musa
acuminata Colla) with the AMF, Glomus intraradices N.C. Schenck & S.S. Sm., increased shoot
dry weight, water uptake, and nutrient uptake and decreased aluminum content in roots and shoots
(250). Apparently, one of the beneﬁts of either ecto- or endomycorrhizal colonization is to amelio-
rate the detrimental eﬀects of aluminum toxicity on root growth and nutrient or water uptake.

Aluminum has toxic eﬀects also on mycorrhizal fungi, adversely aﬀecting the quality and quan-
tity of mycorrhizal colonization (243,251). Diﬀerences in response to aluminum have been found
between ECT fungal species (243). Also, genotypic diﬀerences within an ECT fungal species have
been found in response to aluminum. For example, isolates of ECT fungus, P. tinctorius, from old
coal-mining sites (pH 4.3, 12.1 mM Al) exhibited greater aluminum tolerance based on mycelial
mass at ⱖ 440 µM Al than isolates from rehabilitated mine sites (pH 4.9, 800 µM Al) and those from
forest sites (pH 4.3, 220 µM Al) (252). Strains of the ECT fungus, Suillus luteus Gray, that diﬀered
in aluminum sensitivity were inoculated on Scots pine, and the extramatrical mycelia developed by
the aluminum-resistant strain were more abundant in the presence of aluminum compared to those
of the aluminum-sensitive strain (251). Scots pine seedlings colonized by this aluminum-tolerant
ECT  strain  in  the  presence  of  aluminum  had  greater  shoot  heights  compared  to  noninoculated
seedlings (251).

Cuenca et al. (253) showed that the tropical woody species, Clusia multiﬂora Knuth., inocu-
lated with AMF accumulated less aluminum in roots; instead aluminum was bound to the cell walls
of the fungal mycelium and in vesicles. Using 27Al-NMR, aluminum was found to be taken up and
accumulated  into  polyphosphate  complexes  in  the  vacuole  of  the  ECT  fungus, Laccaria  bicolor
Orton (254). Martin et al. (254) suggested that sequestration of aluminum in polyphosphate com-
plexes could help to protect mycorrhizal plants against aluminum toxicity. An aluminum-adapted
strain  of  an  ECT  fungus, Suillus  bovines Kuntze, had  a  shorter  average  chain  length  of  mobile
polyphosphates  and  greater  terminal  phosphate  groups  (255).  Gerlitz  (255)  proposed  that  this
change increased binding and detoxiﬁcation of polyphosphates to aluminum. A good review of pos-
sible aluminum tolerance mechanisms in ECT is found in Jentschke and Godbold (256).

16.8.2 PLANT MECHANISMS OF ALUMINUM TOLERANCE
Mechanisms of internal tolerance of aluminum involve: (a) complexation with organic acids, (b)
complexation  with  phenolics, (c)  complexation  with  silicon, (d)  sequestration  in  the  vacuole  or
other storage organs, and (e) trapping of aluminum in cells.

16.8.2.1 Complexation with Organic Acids

In  the  leaves  of  aluminum-accumulating  hydrangea, Ma  et  al.  (257)  used  molecular  sieve  chro-
matography to determine that citrate eluted at the same time as aluminum and that the molar ratio
of aluminum to citric acid was approximately 1:1. In the aluminum accumulator, buckwheat, alu-
minum was complexed with citrate in the xylem (258), but with oxalic acid in vacuoles of leaf cells
(259,260). In the aluminum accumulator, Melastoma malabathricum L., aluminum citrate occurred
in the xylem sap and was then transformed into aluminum oxalate for storage in leaves (261,262).

16.8.2.2 Complexation with Phenolics

In aluminum-accumulating tea, Nagata et al. (263) used 27Al-NMR to demonstrate that aluminum
was bound to catechin in young leaves and buds; in mature leaves, aluminum–phenolic acid and
aluminum–organic acid complexes were found. Interestingly, Ofei-Manu et al. (227) showed that at
pH 7 (cytoplasmic pH), aluminum binding capacity is in the order: quercetin ⬎ catechin, chloro-
genic acid, morin ⬎ organic acids. Among ten woody plant species and two marker crop species, a
positive linear correlation was found between root phenolic compounds and aluminum tolerance,
based on aluminum-inhibited root elongation (227).

16.8.2.3 Complexation with Silicon

Cocker et al. (229) proposed that amelioration of aluminum toxicity by silicon is due to formation
of  an  aluminosilicate  compound  in  the  root  apoplast.  Hodson  and  Sangster  (264)  proposed  that
codeposition  of  aluminum  and  silicon  in  needles  of  conifers  is  responsible  for  aluminum
detoxiﬁcation  by  silicon.  Hodson  and  Evans  (228)  reviewed  the  evidence  in  support  of  various
mechanisms of silicon amelioration of aluminum toxicity, and they divided plants into four groups:
(a)  aluminum  accumulators  in  arborescent  dicots, (b)  silicon  accumulators  in  grasses, (c)  gym-
nosperms and arborescent dicots with moderate amounts of aluminum and silicon, and (d) herba-
ceous dicots that exclude aluminum and silicon. Obviously, aluminum can codeposit with silicon
only in plants that accumulate both elements. Aluminum was deposited in phytoliths (hydrated sil-
ica deposits) of conifers, graminaceous plants, and dicots in the Ericaceae family (265,266). Using
x-ray microanalysis, Hodson and Sangster (267) found codeposition of aluminum and silicon in the
outer tangential wall of the endodermis of sorghum. In Faramea marginata Cham., a woody mem-
ber of the Rubiaceae family that is known to accumulate aluminum and silicon in leaves, colocal-
ization of aluminum and silicon in a molar ratio of 1:2 occurred in the cortex of stem sections and
throughout  leaves  (268).  A  good  review  of  aluminum  and  silicon  interactions  can  be  found  in
Hodson and Evans (228), Cocker et al. (229), and Hodson and Sangster (264).

16.8.2.4 Sequestration in the Vacuole or in Other Organelles

Aluminum ions could be sequestered in vacuoles or other storage organelles where they would not
aﬀect metabolism in the cytoplasm adversely. The presence of 50 µM Al increased pyrophosphate-
dependent and ATP-dependent H⫹ pump activity in tonoplast membrane vesicles isolated from bar-
ley roots, and Kasai et al. (269) hypothesized that Al3⫹ was sequestered in the vacuole perhaps by
an Al/nH⫹ exchange reaction. Interestingly, expression of two 51 kDa proteins is strongly induced
in an aluminum-tolerant wheat cultivar, and only weakly expressed in an aluminum-sensitive wheat

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 461

cultivar (270). Sequence analysis of the puriﬁed peptides showed that one is homologous to the B
subunit of the vacuolar H⫹-ATPase (V-ATPase) (270).

In an aluminum-tolerant unicellular red alga (Cyanidium caldarium Geitler), aluminum accu-
mulated in spherical electron-dense bodies in the cytoplasm near the nucleus (271). These bodies
contained high levels of iron and phosphorus, and the researchers speculated that they might be
iron-storage sites under normal culture conditions. Interestingly, transferrin, an iron carrier, is the
main protein that binds Al3⫹ in the blood plasma of animals (47).

16.8.2.5 Trapping of Aluminum in Cells

Fiskesjo  (272)  proposed  that  aluminum  could  be  trapped  in  root  border  cells, which  were  then
detached and sloughed away from roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, detached root border cells
of snap bean were killed by aluminum within 2 h of aluminum exposure (70).

A  punctated  pattern  of  cell  death  was  observed  in  aluminum-tolerant  wheat  roots  after  8 h  of
exposure  to  aluminum, with  an  increase  in  oxalate  oxidase  activity  and  H2O2 production  after  24 h
(273).  Delisle  et  al.  (273)  speculated  that  cell  death  could  be  a  means  for  root  tip  cells  to  trap  or
exclude aluminum from live tissues. Interestingly, a hypersensitive cell death response is a common
means for plants to trap pathogens, not allowing them to spread to other cells. Many genes up-regulated
by aluminum in wheat are similar to pathogenesis-related genes (274).

16.9 ALUMINUM IN SOILS
Aluminum in soil forms the structure of primary and secondary minerals, especially aluminosili-
cates, such as feldspars, micas, kaolins, smectites, and vermiculites (275). As the soils continue to
weather (especially under conditions of high rainfall and warm climates), silicon is leached away,
usually as Si(OH)4 in solution, leaving aluminum behind in the solid forms of aluminum oxyhy-
droxides, such as boehmite and gibbsite, as shown below (276):

The  soils  themselves  become  ‘older,’ more  acidic, and  more  aluminum  toxic  and  would  be

classified as Oxisols or Ultisols.

16.9.1 LOCATIONS OF ALUMINUM-RICH SOILS
According  to  FAO/UNESCO  recent  maps  (277), most  Oxisols  and  Ultisols  are  located  in  the
Tropics and Subtropics (Figure 16.2 and Figure 16.3). More speciﬁcally, about one third of the
Tropics (1.5 billion ha) has suﬃciently strong soil acidity for soluble aluminum to be toxic to most
crops (278). Geographically, Latin America has 821 million ha, Africa 479 million ha, South and
Southeast Asia 236 million ha (278). In the United States (Figure 16.4), a major portion of acid
Ultisols  is  in  the  Southeast  (88  million  ha), from Alabama, Arkansas  to Virginia  (279).  Other
states, such  as  California, New  York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and  Washington, also  have  acid
Ultisols, but to a much smaller extent (280). In contrast, only Hawaii and Puerto Rico have Oxisols
(Figure  16.5). A  detailed  review  of  global  distribution  of  acid  soils  was  given  by  Sumner  and
Noble (281).

16.9.2 FORMS OF ALUMINUM IN SOILS
To be bioavailable, soil aluminum must ﬁrst be in solution (279). Soluble aluminum, however, is
controlled by several processes (Figure 16.6). For example, aluminum-containing minerals, such as
gibbsite and kaolinite, can dissolve under acidic conditions, release aluminum into solution, and

On the other hand, clay minerals with negative charges on their surface, resulting from isomor-
phic substitution (permanent charge) or from hydrolysis of hydroxyl (OH⫺) groups at broken edges
(variable charge), can take aluminum from solution by electrostatic attraction in cation exchange.
Allophane and imogolite, which are amorphous aluminosilicates with large surface areas and high
variable charges, can retain large quantities of aluminum (283). So can solid organic matter (OM)
with many negative charges from carboxyl (–COO⫺) functional groups. Solid OM also can retain
aluminum  strongly  by  another  process  called  speciﬁc  adsorption  or  complexation.  Bloom  et  al.
(284) proposed that aluminum–solid OM interactions were central to the exponential decreases of
soluble aluminum at pH ⬍ 5. They reported a 40% reduction in soluble aluminum after adding 2%
of a decomposed leafy material to an acid B horizon of an inceptisol.

Aluminous minerals in soils are numerous (275). Besides the aluminosilicates and aluminum
oxyhydroxides mentioned previously, aluminum can form sparingly soluble compounds with com-
mon  soil  anions, such  as  phosphates  and  sulfates  (1). Alunite  [KAl3(OH)6(SO4)2], basaluminite
[Al4(OH)10SO4] and jurbanite [Al(OH)SO4· 5H2O] have been found in soils where concentration of
2⫺ was high from fertilization with gypsum or by acid sulfate natural occurrence (282,285,286).
SO4
With  prolonged  phosphorus  fertilization, soluble  phosphorus  concentration  was  increased  with
time, and Al-P minerals, such as variscite, could be formed (287).

The concentration and activity of Al3⫹ in soil solutions not only depend on the processes by
which aluminum is distributed between the solid and liquid phases, but also on its many reactions
in solution. The extent of these aqueous reactions depends on (a) solution pH, (b) ionic strength, (c)
kind and concentration of complexing ligands, and (d) kind and concentration of competing cations
(288).  Important  among  these  reactions  are  hydrolysis, polymerization, and  complexation  with
inorganic (e.g., SO4

2⫺, F⫺) and organic anions (e.g., citrate, malate, fulvates) (Table 16.1) (289).

Thus, there are several diﬀerent species of aluminum in the soil solution, with widely diﬀerent
bioavailability  or  toxicity  (35,37,195).  Another  implication  is  that  Al3⫹ concentration  (activity)
makes up only a relatively small fraction of the total soluble aluminum. Wolt (285) found that free

Aluminum, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1996, pp. 39–80.

Al3⫹ comprised 2 to 61% of total aluminum in soil solutions of acid Ultisols where SO4
2⫺ was the
dominant ligand. Similarly, Hue et al. (195) reported that 76 to 93% of total soil solution aluminum
of two acid Ultisols in Alabama was complexed with low-molecular-weight organic acids.

As discussed earlier, it is generally accepted that Al3⫹ and monomeric Al-hydroxy species are
more toxic to plants than other forms (35,37,195). Several lines of evidence have shown the nontoxic
nature of organically complexed aluminum (195,207,217,290–292). In addition, ionic strength of the
soil  solution  also  plays  an  important  role  in  modifying  aluminum  toxicity  (293).  Expressing  alu-
minum species in terms of activity instead of concentration signiﬁcantly improved the correlation
between plant growth and aluminum toxicity across many soils and soil horizons (293,294).

In addition to monomeric aluminum species, polymeric aluminum species have recently been
studied intensively perhaps because of their reportedly acute phyto/rhizo-toxicities (31,35,295,296).
7⫹] was identiﬁed using 27Al NMR spectroscopy, where
The ‘Al13’ polymer [AlO4Al12(OH)24 (H2O)12
‘clean’ solutions containing relatively high aluminum (⬎ 10 mM) were partially neutralized (297).
However, this polymeric aluminum species (Al13) could not be detected in soil solutions containing
SO4

2⫺ or silicates (298).

16.9.3 DETECTION OR DIAGNOSIS OF EXCESS ALUMINUM IN SOILS
As discussed earlier, soil aluminum can exist in many diﬀerent pools, and its reactions within the soil
solution are also quite intricate. It is generally accepted that the activity of monomeric hydroxyalu-
minum species should be a good predictor of aluminum toxicity for a given plant species if (a) the
aluminum absorption by plants is small relative to the quantity of toxic aluminum species in the soil
solution such that the solution activity remains virtually constant as the plant grows (steady-state
condition) or (b) any decrease in the activity of toxic aluminum species is readily compensated for
by solid phase aluminum or nontoxic aluminum in solution (equilibrium condition). In reality, these
conditions are hardly met, thus solution activity (intensity factor) and an estimate of the aluminum-
buﬀering capacity (capacity factor) are required to evaluate or predict the toxicity of soil aluminum.

16.9.3.1 Extractable and Exchangeable Aluminum
Diﬀerent methods have been used to extract solid-phase aluminum, which presumably correlates well
with aluminum phytotoxicity (299). An unbuﬀered solution of 1 M KCl is commonly used to extract
the fraction of aluminum (often referred to as ‘exchangeable’), which is presumably held by negative
charges on the soil surface. When exchangeable aluminum is expressed as a percentage of the eﬀective
cation exchange capacity (ECEC), it is referred to as the aluminum saturation percentage. Table 16.2

lists values of exchangeable aluminum and aluminum saturation percentage for some acid soils from
Latin America (300). The amount of aluminum extracted by neutral salts, such as 1 M KCl or 0.01 M
CaCl2, however, varies with extraction time, concentration of the extracting solution (301), and with
the number of successive extractions (302).

Other solutions such as 1 M NH4Cl, 0.01 M CaCl2, or 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2 have also been used to
extract aluminum. There are indications that aluminum extracted with 0.01 M CaCl2, an extractant
that mimics the ionic strength (and composition) of highly weathered acid soils, correlates well with
the free Al3⫹ activity in soil solution and with aluminum phytotoxicity (303–304).

Also, 0.5 M CuCl2 and 0.33 M LaCl3 have been used to extract organically bound aluminum
(284,305). Copper reacts strongly with carboxylate sites that bind aluminum and can readily replace
aluminum  bound  to  the  solid  organic  matter.  Lanthanum  is  less  eﬀective  than  copper, but  more
eﬀective than potassium, in displacing organically bound aluminum (306).

Despite potential diﬃculties in extracting toxic forms of aluminum with neutral salt solutions,
exchangeable aluminum and aluminum saturation percentage have been used extensively as an indi-
cator of aluminum toxicity in acid soils and in estimating the lime requirement (307). Growth of
many plants in acid soils was reduced by 50% or more compared to growth in limed soil when the
soil aluminum saturation was ⬎ 60% (307). As for lime requirement, it is generally accepted that
the amount of CaCO3 required to neutralize toxic aluminum can be estimated as follows:
The CaCO3 requirement (t ha⫺1) ⫽ K ⫻ exchangeable aluminum (cmolC kg⫺1)

where K ranges from 1.5 to 3.0 and averages 2.0 (307). Often K is ⬎ 1 to partly account for the
fraction of aluminum that is not extracted by KCl. On the other hand, as pointed out by Adams
(279), the critical aluminum-saturation percentage, above which relative plant growth would be
restricted by 10% or more, varies markedly with soils and crops. For example, the critical alu-
minum saturation for soybean was about 20 to 25% for Ultisols in Alabama and North Carolina
(308–310). It was about 6% for an Ultisol in South Carolina (308), 5% for a Spodosol in Florida
(311), and 30% for an Oxisol in Brazilian Amazon (312). As for diﬀerent crops, the critical alu-
minum saturation was 4 to 5% for alfalfa, white clover, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.),
and  sericea  lespedeza  (Kummerowia  striata Schindl., formerly  Lespedeza  striata)  (313,314).  It
was 40 to 50% for corn grown on three Ultisols in North Carolina (315), 1 to 8% for six Ultisols
in Georgia (316) and 30% for an Oxisol in Brazil (312). Similarly, Adams and Moore (317), using
the elongation rate of cotton taproot as an indicator of aluminum toxicity, found that the critical
aluminum  saturation  was  2%  in  the  Bt2  horizon  of  one  soil  but  more  than  56%  in  the  Bt1  of
another soil in Alabama. For peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), the critical aluminum saturation was
60% (312). Evidently, additional and perhaps better methods for identifying the toxic aluminum
forms are needed.

16.9.3.2 SOIL-SOLUTION ALUMINUM
Soil solution can be collected by several techniques, such as zero-tension lysimeters (in situ ﬁeld
sampling), column displacement with a miscible liquid, or high-speed centrifugation with or with-
out  a  heavy  liquid  that  is  immiscible  with  water  (laboratory  sampling)  (299,318).  These  tech-
niques, however, are  time  consuming  and  often  require  high  skills  and  care  (in  terms  of  pH
changes  due  to  CO2 loss, and  contamination)  especially  when  aluminum  concentrations  are  at
micromolar levels.

Once  in  solution, be  it  soil  solution  or  dilute  neutral  salt  extracts, soluble  aluminum  can  be
quantiﬁed readily using atomic absorption (preferably ﬂameless) spectroscopy or inductively cou-
pled plasma emission spectroscopy. Alternatively, total soluble aluminum can be measured colori-
metrically after forming a colored complex with an organic agent (319).

The separation of total soluble aluminum into diﬀerent forms (speciation) is more involved, and
many techniques have been proposed, which can be grouped into three main categories: (a) analytical
separation of various aluminum fractions based on diﬀerential reaction kinetics with complexing agents

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 468

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

or the physico-chemical separation of aluminum fractions based on size and charge; (b) computational
diﬀerentiation of aluminum species from an analytically determined ‘total’ aluminum fraction, using a
thermodynamically  based  geochemical  speciation  model  with  mass  balance  constraints  (320);  and 
(c) combination of one or more analytical techniques with a geochemical speciation model (321).

The  most  common  timed  spectrophotometric  methods  for  aluminum  determination  include 
8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and pyrocatechol violet (PCV) (322–325). James et al. (322) used a 15 s
reaction  with  HQ  buﬀered  at  pH  5.2, followed  by  extraction  into  butyl  acetate, as  a  method  for
measuring monomeric aluminum species; a 30-min reaction would measure the total soluble alu-
minum. The PCV method requires a longer reaction time (approximately 20 min as suggested by
Menzies et al. (325)) to complex completely with monomeric aluminum; thus, it is more suitable
for an automated procedure.

Aluminum fractionation methods based on size or charge include dialysis, ultraﬁltration, size-
exclusion chromatography, ion chromatography, capillary zone electrophoresis, and C-18 reverse-
phase chromatography (299). Soluble aluminum can also be measured indirectly by reacting it with
F⫺, then measuring the unreacted free F⫺ with an ion-elective electrode (326). A quantitative 27Al
NMR method is often preferred for the measurement of the ‘Al13’ polymer (327).

The  use  of  solution  Al3⫹ activities  to  predict  or  characterize  aluminum  phytotoxicity  are

discussed in the later section on soil analysis.

16.9.4 INDICATOR PLANTS
Baker (328) proposed that there are three types of plant responses to increasing heavy metal con-
tents in soil: (a) accumulators, where heavy metals are concentrated in above-ground plant parts;
(b) indicators, where internal concentrations reﬂect external levels; and (c) excluders, where metal
concentrations in shoots are low and constant over a wide range of soil concentrations up to a crit-
ical soil level above which unrestricted transport occurs. It might be expected that aluminum accu-
mulators would be good indicator plant species; however, this relationship has not been found to be
true. Truman et al. (14) reported that only a weak linear relationship was found between foliage alu-
minum concentration of Pinus spp. and exchangeable aluminum in soil. Even in controlled nutrient
solution culture, foliar aluminum levels of red spruce varied almost ﬁvefold at a similar solution of
aluminum concentration (78).

An alternate method of determining the status of soil aluminum is to grow pairs of aluminum-
tolerant and sensitive genotypes of some common crops, such as barley or snapbean, then observe
their  diﬀerential  responses.  For  example, shoots  of  the  aluminum-sensitive  ‘Romano’ snapbean
showed a signiﬁcant response to liming of an acid (pH 5.1) soil from Beltsville, Maryland, but those
of the aluminum-tolerant ‘Dade’ did not; this dry weight diﬀerence indicated that aluminum toxic-
ity was the main factor limiting growth (329). Sanchez (300) reported that there was a high degree
of tolerance to acid (mostly Al) soil in many varieties of upland rice and cowpea. Such knowledge
would be very useful in identifying and managing aluminum-toxic soils.

16.10 ALUMINUM IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL NUTRITION

16.10.1 ALUMINUM AS AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT
Speculation that aluminum is an essential nutrient has persisted for at least 70 years (330); yet to
date, there is no conclusive evidence for its essentiality in the diets of animals or humans (6,7).
One of the earliest speculations about the essentiality was by E. E. Smith, president of the New York
Academy of Sciences in the early 1900s. In his 1928 book on aluminum, he described the eﬀects
of  adding  diﬀerent  elements  to  milk  on  the  growth  and  fertility  of  rats  consuming  only  a  milk
diet  (330,331).  Aluminum  was  one  of  the  added  elements  that  appeared  to  be  necessary  for
normal fertility and survival of oﬀspring. On this basis, and the fact that aluminum was present in

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 469

Aluminum

469

tissues of the rat, Smith concluded that aluminum ‘exercises a true and essential biological func-
tion.’ This early research with milk diets must be considered equivocal, however, and has never been
repeated.

Since this early work, few studies have directly addressed the question of aluminum’s essen-
tiality. In 1980, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the existing research and stated that
‘aluminum has not been proven to be essential to animals, but indirect evidence suggests it may be’
(332). The indirect evidence included accumulation of aluminum in regenerating bone, stimulation
of  certain  enzyme  systems, eﬀective  use  as  an  adjuvant, and  a  report  that  aluminum  stimulated
growth in poultry.

Despite  this  optimism, recent  reviews  conclude  that  the  evidence  for  the  essentiality  of  alu-
minum remains quite limited (6,7). The reports of aluminum accumulation in regenerating bone,
stimulation of certain enzymes, and the often-cited ability of aluminum to combine with ﬂuoride
and activate the guanine nucleotide (GTP) binding regulatory element of adenylate cyclase (333)
are actions of aluminum that have never been proven to be required for normal biological function
in any organism. This leaves, then, two isolated studies indicating that a deﬁciency of aluminum in
the diet may modestly inhibit the growth of goats and chickens as the only support for essentiality
(6,7). These studies, however, have yet to be validated by others. If aluminum is ever shown to be
essential, it appears that the levels required in the diet are so low (less than 200 µg kg⫺1 diet in the
goat study) that dietary deﬁciency would be very rare.

16.10.2 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF ALUMINUM
Although the essentiality of aluminum as a nutrient is questionable, aluminum compounds have
been used for many years in animal agriculture, environmental management, and the food and phar-
maceutical industries for beneﬁcial purposes. In animals and humans, the beneﬁcial eﬀects usually
occur at levels of aluminum intake far above that found in typical diets and, as such, in pharmaco-
logical treatments that may carry some risk of aluminum toxicity.

16.10.2.1 Beneficial Effects of Aluminum in Animal Agriculture

Aluminum is generally not added to animal diets because of the lack of any known nutritional func-
tion, and no evidence suggests beneﬁcial eﬀects occur in livestock grazing high-aluminum pastures.
Rather, aluminum toxicity is of concern as some forages contain over 2000 mg Al kg⫺1 (334). For a
variety of useful reasons, however, aluminum compounds have been added to animal diets.

One of the oldest uses of aluminum compounds in agriculture is the use of bentonite clay (Al
silicates of sodium, calcium, or other cations) as a binder for pelleted feeds. Studies in the 1950s
with poultry indicated no detrimental eﬀects of ingesting bentonite, and some indicated a beneﬁcial
eﬀect on growth rate. Beneﬁts were attributed to an increase in feed intake and a delay in the pas-
sage  of  feed  through  the  digestive  tract  resulting  in  better  absorption  of  nutrients  (335).  More
recently, bentonite and other aluminosilicates have been investigated for their ability to ameliorate
the toxic eﬀects of aﬂotoxin-contaminated feeds on growth and feed intake in poultry and swine
(336,337). Feeding hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicates has also been shown to reduce the
passage  of  aﬂatoxins  into  milk  (338).  The  mechanism  of  action  appears  to  be  adsorption  of
aﬂatoxins by the aluminosilicates, reducing aﬂatoxin bioavailability.

The  addition  of  aluminosilicates  to  poultry  diets  has  also  been  reported  to  enhance  eggshell
quality (339). Feeding sodium zeolite A, a synthetic aluminosilicate with a 1:1 ratio of aluminum
to silicon, increased the levels of silicon and aluminum in the blood. The authors suggested that the
increase in blood silicon stimulated calcium use for eggshell formation. Wisser et al. (340), how-
ever, were able to show small increases in eggshell quality by adding aluminum sulfate to poultry
diets, suggesting that aluminum had an eﬀect independent of silicon. With aluminum sulfate, how-
ever, aluminum accumulated in the bones of the hens and reduced fertility. Similar, but less severe

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 470

470

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

toxic eﬀects were reported with sodium zeolite A, suggesting that zeolites may be a safer way to
stimulate eggshell formation (341).

Sodium zeolite A has also been shown to prevent a condition referred to as milk fever (parturi-
ent hypocalcemia) in dairy cows, a relatively common problem in the dairy industry (342). Around
the time of calving, the metabolic demand for calcium to support gestational growth and milk pro-
duction is large. This demand for calcium can result in hypocalcemia leading to muscle tremors,
weakness, and eventually death if not treated. Sodium zeolite A added to the ration for 3 weeks prior
to calving was found to stimulate calcium mobilization from bone and enhance the eﬃciency of cal-
cium absorption, preventing hypocalcemia (342). The stimulus for these changes in calcium metab-
olism  appeared  to  come  from  an  aluminum-induced  reduction  in  phosphate  availability, since
treated cows had signiﬁcantly lower plasma inorganic phosphate levels.

Similar to the above concept of using aluminum to inhibit phosphate absorption, aluminum has
been  shown  to  inhibit  ﬂuoride  absorption  and  protect  against  ﬂuoride  toxicity  in  poultry  (343).
Aluminum  ﬂuoride  complexes  may  be  formed  in  the  body, however, and  may  have  detrimental
eﬀects of their own (344). Aluminum has also been studied for its beneﬁcial eﬀects on reducing lead
toxicity (345).

Some of the beneﬁcial roles of aluminum compounds in animal agriculture are unrelated to alu-
minum ingestion. Aluminum sulfate has been used to acidify poultry litter to reduce the growth and
transmission of bacterial infections caused by Campylobacter. Campylobacter is a common cause
of diarrhea in humans, and undercooked poultry is a potential source. In a recent study, litter con-
taminated with this bacterium was treated with aluminum sulfate, then, newly hatched chicks were
raised on the treated litter (346). No transmission of Campylobacter to the chicks was observed.
Unfortunately, the treatment was not eﬀective against Salmonella. Aluminum compounds have also
been used to treat animal manure prior to land applications to reduce environmental impacts. This
practice will be discussed in the next section.

16.10.2.2 Beneficial Uses of Aluminum in Environmental Management and 

Water Treatment

The use of animal manures as fertilizers can increase water pollution problems due to runoﬀ of sol-
uble phosphorus. Several aluminum-containing compounds have been shown to reduce phosphate
runoﬀ if  applied  to  manure.  Applications  of  aluminum  sulfate  or  aluminum  chloride  to  swine
manure reduced soluble phosphate in runoﬀ by 84%, presumably by forming insoluble phosphate
complexes  (347).  In  a  large  scale, on-farm  trial, aluminum  sulfate  was  applied  over  a  16-month
period to litter in 97 poultry houses on the Delmarva Peninsula. Compared to litter from untreated
houses, treated litter had decreased soluble phosphates, a lower pH, and higher total nitrogen and
sulfur concentrations, thereby increasing its value as a fertilizer (348). Zeolite and aluminum sul-
fate were evaluated in amending slurries of dairy manure (349). Aluminum sulfate eliminated sol-
uble phosphorus, and zeolite reduced it by over half. Both aluminum compounds reduced ammonia
emissions by 50%, presumably by reducing the pH or by adsorbing ammonium cations. Peak et al.
(350) used x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy to determine the chemical species of aluminum
and phosphorus in treated manures. No evidence of aluminum phosphate precipitation was found.
Therefore, the mechanism of action is not clear and brings up the possibility that soluble forms of
aluminum may be present in the treated manures and, hence, in the runoﬀ, especially if excess alu-
minum is used in the treatment process.

Aluminum sulfate also has been used to treat algal-rich, eutrophied lakes. Welch and Cooke
(351) reported the eﬀectiveness and longevity of treatments in 21 lakes across the United States.
They concluded that aluminum sulfate eﬀectively reduced total soluble phosphate levels (and the
algae that depend on this nutrient) for 8 years on average, especially in lakes without large external
inputs of phosphorus. Aluminum is thought to form insoluble aggregates of aluminum phosphate,
hydroxide, and organic material that settle to the bottom of the lake and remain in the sediment

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 471

Aluminum

471

unless solubilized by acidic conditions. Acid conditions release soluble forms of aluminum that can
be toxic to ﬁsh, prompting guidelines that lake pH should remain between 5.5 and 9.0.

Very little evidence suggests that aluminum is beneﬁcial to aquatic species under normal cir-
cumstances. Short-term protective eﬀects of aluminum against acid (H⫹) toxicity have been shown
in some studies (352). Uptake of protons from acidic water can fatally disrupt electrolyte regulation
in ﬁsh. However, under acidic conditions, monomeric aluminum (Al⫹3) may bind to gill surfaces
blocking the binding and systemic uptake of H⫹, thereby improving survival. This protective eﬀect
may only last a few hours and has been reported only under laboratory conditions. Aluminum in
acidic water (pH 5.2 to 5.9) was also shown to eliminate ectoparasites on Atlantic salmon better
than acidic water alone (353).

Municipal water treatment facilities often use aluminum sulfate as a water-clarifying agent in a
process similar to that described above for treating eutrophied lakes. The basic process is ancient,
originating in China thousands of years ago. When aluminum sulfate is added to turbid water at pH
6.5 to 8, aluminum hydroxide forms as a gel-like precipitate (ﬂoc). Suspended particles and oils are
trapped  in  the  ﬂoc, which  is  then  removed  by  various  methods.  Some  aluminum, however, can
remain in solution. Concentrations of aluminum in treated drinking water have ranged from unde-
tectable to 2.7 mg L⫺1, with a median of 0.1 mg L⫺1 (354). The Environmental Protection Agency
has suggested a maximum contamination level for aluminum in drinking water at a concentration
range  of  0.05  to  0.2 mg  L⫺1.  Recently, other  types  of  aluminum-based  clarifying  agents  such  as
polyaluminum  chloride  have  been  used  that  may  result  in  less  residual  aluminum  and  diﬀerent
chemical species of residual aluminum in treated water compared to current methods (355,356).
Clariﬁcation  of  water  by  aluminum  compounds  has  been  investigated  for  its  potential  to  reduce
drinking water ﬂuoride concentrations in regions where ﬂuoride toxicity is a concern (357).

16.10.3 TOXICITY OF ALUMINUM TO ANIMALS AND HUMANS
The ubiquitous presence of aluminum in soil, water, food, and pharmaceuticals makes exposure to
this metal unavoidable for most species. The potential toxicity to humans has been debated since at
least the 1920s with the advent of commercially available aluminum-containing baking powders
(330). In natural habitats, concern about toxicity increased in the 1970s with the knowledge that
acidiﬁcation of natural waters from acid rain, mine drainage, and deforestation increased the mobi-
lization and bioavailability of soil aluminum (352). The growing awareness of increased exposure
to aluminum and the clear demonstration of its potential toxicity to animals and humans (discussed
below), combined with its possible association with Alzheimer’s disease has given rise to an expo-
nential increase in research related to the metabolism and toxicity of this metal. In the decade from
1970 to 1980, only 140 publications are listed by a bibliographic search using the keywords ‘alu-
minum toxicity,’ compared to 1035 publications in the decade from 1990 to 2000. For this reason,
a detailed review of aluminum toxicity and metabolism in animals and humans is outside the scope
of this chapter and the reader is referred to several recent reviews for this purpose (358–360). The
focus of this section will be on the consequences of aluminum exposure from common sources in
the food chain with reference, when possible, to potential toxic mechanisms.

16.10.3.1 Toxicity to Wildlife

Much of the concern about aluminum toxicity to wildlife stems from the fact that many lakes and
streams have been acidiﬁed by natural or industrial causes resulting in increased concentrations
of aluminum in their waters. Sparling and Lowe (352) presented a comprehensive review of the
environmental  toxicity  of  aluminum  and  discuss  its  toxicity  in  invertebrates, ﬁsh, and  other
wildlife.

Aquatic species, especially freshwater ﬁsh, have been studied the most, and it is clear that their
survival can be reduced greatly as aluminum concentrations increase in acidic water (361). In fact,

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 472

472

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

aluminum toxicity is thought to be the most common cause of ﬁsh die-oﬀs. Levels of aluminum
above 100 to 500 µg L⫺1 are usually needed to cause death depending on ﬁsh species and water con-
ditions such as the amount of dissolved organic matter and pH. Acidity is also toxic and is additive
to the eﬀects of aluminum.

The mechanisms of aluminum toxicity fall into two categories based on water pH: asphyxia-
tion in the pH range of 6.5 to 5.5, and loss of electrolytes from the blood in the pH range of 5.5 to
4.5. At the more acidic pH range, soluble cationic species of aluminum are thought to bind to neg-
atively charged sites on the gill surface, displacing bound calcium ions that regulate electrolyte
ﬂuxes. This displacement results in the diﬀusion of sodium and chloride out of the body. In the
less  acidic  pH  range  of  5.5  to  6.5, the  formation  of  uncharged Al(OH)3 is  more  likely.  These
uncharged species form colloids and precipitates that collect on the gill surface, stimulating excess
mucus formation. The excess mucus inhibits oxygen and CO2 diﬀusion leading to asphyxiation
(362). Aluminum  appears  to  be  relatively  nontoxic  to  ﬁsh  at  basic  pHs  where  anionic  species
would predominate.

Dissolved organic matter, such as humic acid, can chelate positively charged aluminum species
preventing  aluminum  from  interacting  with  the  gill, thereby  reducing  aluminum  stress  (352).
Birchall (363) has proposed that silicon can also ameliorate aluminum toxicity by forming colloidal
hydroxyaluminosilicates that limit the availability of aluminum for binding to gill surfaces.

Much less is known about aluminum toxicity to other aquatic species such as crustaceans, mol-
lusks, and insect larvae. In general, these invertebrate species are more tolerant to aluminum than
ﬁsh, but toxic mechanisms appear to be similar in those that have gills, i.e., related to alterations in
calcium and electrolyte balance or respiration rates. In contrast to ﬁsh, however, invertebrates may
accumulate large amounts of aluminum on or within their bodies reaching concentrations as high
as 1000 mg kg⫺1 (352,363,364).

There has been some concern about transfer of aluminum up the food chain. Nyholm (365) pos-
tulated that elevated levels of aluminum in invertebrates could aﬀect wild birds feeding in or near
aluminum-laden waters. In studies with ﬂycatchers, it was reported that female birds had elevated
bone aluminum levels and laid deformed eggs with soft shells leading to dehydration and reduced
hatchability. Other concerns were with bone growth and body weight gain in growing chicks since
aluminum in the diet at a level of 1000 mg kg⫺1 has been shown to inhibit phosphate absorption,
reduce feed intake, and accumulate in bone (366). Not all studies, however, have found signiﬁcant
toxic eﬀects on wild birds (352).

Although  the  ecological  impacts  of  aluminum  mobilization  into  acidiﬁed  water  has  been  an
important concern, recent studies by Palmer and Driscoll (367) indicate, at least in northern hard-
wood forests in the United States, that stream water aluminum concentrations are declining. They
suggested that within 10 years, at the current rate of decline, aluminum toxicity would no longer
pose a threat to ﬁsh. Remediation of acidic aluminum-laden water also is being accomplished by
adding powered limestone (CaCO3) to increase pH and reduce levels of soluble aluminum and, in
some cases, total aluminum (352).

16.10.3.2 Toxicity to Agricultural Animals

Generally, aluminum toxicity has not been a serious problem in livestock production (cattle, swine,
sheep, and poultry). Levels of aluminum in most common feedstuﬀs, forages, pastures, and water
supplies usually are not high enough to cause problems in animal performance or in the safety of
food derived from animals, i.e., they result in diets that contain less than the maximum tolerable lev-
els listed by the National Research Council: 1000 mg kg⫺1 dry feed for cattle and sheep and 200 mg
kg⫺1 for swine, poultry, horses, and rabbits (332). These values are for highly soluble forms of alu-
minum, and higher levels of less soluble forms may be tolerated.

Nevertheless, there has been concern about the toxic levels of intake in cattle and sheep forag-
ing  on  plants  that  either  accumulate  high  levels  of  aluminum  or  are  contaminated  with  large

CRC_DK2972_Ch016.qxd  7/24/2006  7:23 PM  Page 473

Aluminum

473

amounts  of  soil, and  in  poultry  consuming  diets  that  contain  aluminum  from  contaminated  feed
ingredients  or  from  added  zeolites.  Toxicity  symptoms  are  rather  consistent  across  species.
Symptoms include decreased feed intake, reduced eﬃciency in converting feed to body weight gain,
disturbances  in  mineral  metabolism  including  reduced  phosphate  absorption, hypercalcemia,
reduced bone mineralization, and accumulation of aluminum in body tissues. Large intakes of sol-
uble forms of aluminum (above 3000 to 4000 mg kg⫺1 diet) can be fatal, especially in young ani-
mals, or when dietary calcium or phosphorus is low (332).

Storer and Nelson (368) were one of the ﬁrst to compare the toxicity of diﬀerent chemical forms
of aluminum using young chickens as an animal model. They showed that compounds that were not
soluble in dilute acid or water, such as aluminum oxide, did not produce symptoms of toxicity even
at dietary levels up to 16,000 mg kg⫺1 diet. Compounds that were soluble such as aluminum chlo-
ride, sulfate, acetate and nitrate produced severe toxicity at the 5000 mg kg⫺1 level. Interestingly,
aluminum  phosphate, which  is  soluble  in  dilute  acid  but  not  in  water, did  not  produce  toxicity
apparently due to precipitation in the alkaline environment of the small intestine and its inability to
reduce the bioavailability of other forms of dietary phosphate.

16.10.3.2.1 Toxicity to Ruminants (Cattle and Sheep)
Aluminum toxicity to ruminants has not been reported under most livestock production systems.
But, some concern has been expressed about the risks of inducing either a phosphorus deﬁciency or
a condition known as grass tetany when ruminants consume large amounts of aluminum from soil
or aluminum-rich forages. In general, soil does not appear to be toxic, but the more soluble forms
of aluminum in plants may pose some risk.

Ruminants can consume large amounts of soil under some pasture conditions and, therefore,
may consume large amounts of aluminum (up to 1.5% of the diet dry matter) (369). Since phos-
phorus is the mineral most likely to be deﬁcient in the diet of grazing cattle, studies have looked at
the eﬀects of soil intake on phosphorus nutrition. Most have shown that soil intake has a minimal
eﬀect  on  phosphorus  balance  and  animals  are  able  to  maintain  normal  serum  phosphate  levels
(370,371). Apparently, the aluminum species in soil are not soluble enough in the intestinal tract of
the ruminant to cause signiﬁcant precipitation of available phosphate.

It is clear, however, that soluble forms of aluminum can induce toxicity. Crowe et al. (369) fed
diets that contained soluble aluminum chloride hexahydrate at 2000 mg Al kg⫺1 diet to Holstein
dairy calves for 7 weeks. The results are typical of studies in ruminants using soluble forms of alu-
minum (370). Feed intake decreased by 17%, average daily weight gain decreased by 47%, and
the amount of feed needed to produce a kilogram of weight gain increased by 50%. Fecal phos-
phorus excretion increased by 79% and plasma inorganic phosphate concentrations dropped to lev-
els  found  in  phosphorus-deﬁcient  animals.  Aluminum  accumulated  in  bone  thereby  causing
demineralization, serum  calcium  concentrations  rose, and  urinary  and  fecal  calcium  excretion
increased. To what extent natural aluminum species in forages can cause these symptoms is not
known.

Grass  tetany  is  a  serious, often  fatal  metabolic  disorder, characterized  by  low  magnesium
levels  in  the  blood.  Grass  tetany  occurs  most  often  in  female  ruminants  in  the  early  stages  of
immature, magnesium-deﬁcient  grasses  in  springtime.
lactation  while  grazing  on  succulent,
Symptoms include poor coordination, convulsions, and death, presumably related to a metabolic
deﬁciency of magnesium. Several outbreaks of grass tetany have been associated with pastures and
forages containing high aluminum concentrations such as wheat and tall fescue containing 1000 to
2000 mg Al  kg⫺1 (372). Although  most  studies  looking  at  soil  aluminum  intake  have  not  shown
signiﬁcant eﬀects on serum magnesium levels, some studies using soluble aluminum (such as alu-
minum citrate) have shown small decreases (370,372). It was suggested that the decrease in serum
magnesium was not caused by reduced magnesium absorption. Rather, aluminum can cause hyper-
calcemia, which induces the loss of magnesium in urine. This loss may contribute to the appearance
of grass tetany.

16.10.3.2.2 Toxicity to Poultry
Aluminum toxicity has not been reported as a signiﬁcant problem in poultry production, but concerns
have been raised due to the possible intake of soluble aluminum compounds from feed ingredients
such as aluminum-ﬂocculated algae, aluminum-contaminated mineral mixes, or the intentional use of
zeolites to improve eggshell quality.

Sodium zeolite A (Na12[(AlO2)12 (SiO2)12]- 27H2O) is a synthetic aluminosilicate with cation
exchange properties that has been shown to improve eggshell quality when added to the diet at 0.75
to 1.5%, as mentioned earlier under beneﬁcial eﬀects. When added to the diets of young chicks,
however, it caused reductions in feed intake, growth, bone ash, and serum phosphate, and increased
serum calcium and bone aluminum content (373–375).

The soluble forms of aluminum are relatively more toxic, but generally show the same biolog-
ical eﬀects as sodium zeolite A (340,366,376). Interestingly, however, soluble forms tend to inhibit
calcium absorption from low calcium diets, whereas, zeolites seem to enhance it. No studies have
been done to evaluate the eﬀects of including natural, aluminum-loaded plant or animal products in
the diet.

The  fact  that  consuming  high  levels  of  aluminum  usually  decreases  food  intake  makes  it
diﬃcult  to  identify  toxic  eﬀects  of  aluminum  that  are  independent  of  reduced  nutrient  intakes.
Wisser  et  al.  (340), however, showed  that  adding  aluminum  sulfate  to  the  diet  of  laying  hens
decreased  egg  production  and  fertility, and  increased  serum  calcium  without  causing  signiﬁcant
decreases in food intake or plasma phosphate. This implies that systemic aluminum can have direct
toxic eﬀects on metabolism.

16.10.3.3 Toxicity to Humans

There is no doubt that aluminum intake can be toxic to humans under certain conditions. Regular
intake  of  large  doses  of  aluminum  hydroxide  can  cause  bone  disease, anemia, and  neurological
problems in patients with poor renal function that cannot adequately excrete aluminum from the
body. Similar eﬀects can occur in healthy individuals if aluminum intake is high enough, over a long
enough period. There are questions about the relationship of aluminum to Alzheimer’s disease and
the health consequences of long-term, low-level exposures that remain unanswered. The reader is
referred to several recent reviews for detailed discussions of these topics (358–360).

16.10.3.3.1 Overview of Aluminum Metabolism
The intestine is viewed as a protective barrier against aluminum toxicity as only a small fraction
(0  to  0.5%)  of  ingested  aluminum  is  absorbed  from  any  source.  However, of  the  small  amount
absorbed, about  half  is  retained  in  tissues  and  the  other  half  is  excreted, primarily  in  urine.
Elimination  from  tissues  is  not  rapid  so, in  the  face  of  constant  intake, tissues  accumulate  alu-
minum over time.

Drueke (377), and Yokel and McNamara (359) provide recent reviews of the absorption and
metabolism  of  aluminum. A  number  of  factors  inﬂuence  the  eﬃciency  of  absorption.  Most  are
dietary factors that aﬀect solubility; hence, phosphate reduces absorption as does ingesting insolu-
ble forms of aluminum such as aluminum oxide. Silicon has shown conﬂicting results, but does not
appear to reduce absorption except when given as insoluble, oligomeric forms. The soluble alu-
minum salts have higher absorption eﬃciencies, although the hydroxide appears to be less bioavail-
able  than  more  soluble  forms.  Citrate, as  well  as  other  organic  acids  including  ascorbic, oxalic,
lactic, and tartaric acids can greatly enhance absorption possibly by increasing solubility or charge
neutralization  when  complexed  species  are  formed.  The  mechanism, however, is  not  yet  under-
stood.  Aluminum-accumulating  plants  which  store  aluminum  bound  to  organic  acids  would  be
expected to contain bioavailable aluminum, but this concept has never been tested. Polyphenolic
acids  have  recently  been  shown  to  increase  tissue  uptake  of  aluminum  from  food, suggesting
increased absorption (378). Fluoride may also enhance absorption.

Aluminum

The mechanism of aluminum absorption is not well understood but appears to involve active
transport through the intestinal cells as well as passive diﬀusion. High iron diets inhibit transport
whereas low iron diets enhance it, suggesting that aluminum can follow iron transport pathways.

In the blood, about 80% of aluminum is bound to iron binding sites on transferrin, the major iron
transport  protein  in  plasma  (47,48). The  remainder  is  bound  to  low-molecular-weight  molecules,
possibly citrate. Since most tissues take up transferrin to acquire iron, this process provides a mech-
anism for aluminum to enter cells, including the brain. Tissue uptake from the citrate-bound form is
also possible. In fact, increased dietary citrate appears to enhance tissue accumulation of aluminum
as well as urinary excretion. In renal-failure patients, citrate greatly enhances risk of toxicity.

Bone is the major tissue deposition site with aluminum accumulating at areas of active miner-
alization, possibly as aluminum citrate. Aluminum also enters and is toxic to the bone forming cells
(osteoblasts).  Other  tissues  accumulate  lesser  amounts  of  aluminum, usually  in  the  order:
bone ⬎ liver ⬎ kidney ⬎ spleen ⬎ brain.  Contrary  to  other  tissues, the  brain  has  not  always  been
found  to  accumulate  aluminum  in  association  with  increased  dietary  intake.  Nevertheless, alu-
minum is routinely found in the brain in measurable amounts. Elimination of aluminum from tis-
sues is relatively slow compared with its rapid uptake, with half-lives estimated in terms of months
or years. Elimination from bone is the most rapid, and that from brain is the slowest. Body loads
are typically low, 30 to 50 mg in healthy individuals on usual diets.

The intracellular metabolism of aluminum is poorly understood. Presumably, it initially follows
the pathways of iron metabolism being incorporated with transferrin-bound iron into endosomes.
Its subsequent fate, or the fate of citrate bound aluminum are unknown.

16.10.3.3.2 Overview of the Biochemical Mechanisms of Aluminum Toxicity
The biochemical mechanisms of aluminum toxicity leading to neurodegeneration, bone loss, and
anemia are not understood and an explanation for these symptoms cannot be made at this time. At
its most fundamental level, the systemic toxicity of aluminum is probably related to its strong bind-
ing aﬃnity for three-oxygen-donor ligands, especially negatively charged oxygen donors found in
organic phosphates and proteins with carboxylic acid or phosphorylated residues (379). This strong
binding can displace magnesium ions, alter the structure and function of substrates, enzymes, reg-
ulatory and structural proteins, and in poorly understood ways interfere with iron metabolism. The
biochemical aspects of aluminum toxicity in animals and man have recently been reviewed (360).
It is likely that the basic biochemical eﬀects of aluminum are similar in plant and animal cells.

Before systemic toxicity is discussed, it should be remembered that dietary aluminum toxicity
often induces a phosphate deﬁciency. Appetite and growth are depressed. Bone mineral is dissolved
in an attempt to raise serum phosphate levels and hypercalcemia may result. Skeletal muscle may
also lose intracellular phosphorus and magnesium to the blood, resulting in lowered ATP synthesis
and a general lack of phosphate for metabolic use within the muscle. Intracellular calcium levels
become elevated. Bone pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms including confusion,
seizures, and coma can occur (380).

Once aluminum gains entry into the body and enters cells, it is thought to bind to phosphate lig-
ands, particularly ATP. It also binds to proteins. Bound aluminum may alter enzyme activity by dis-
placing cofactors such as Mg⫹⫹, by aﬀecting the binding of substrates such as ATP, or by inducing
conformational  changes.  For  example, aluminum  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  ATP  dependent
enzymes  such  as  hexokinase. The  mechanism  is  thought  to  involve  formation  of Al-ATP  that  is
much more stable and binds much tighter to proteins than Mg-ATP, inhibiting enzyme action. More
than 20 other enzymes are reportedly inhibited or stimulated by aluminum (379).

Aluminum may also inﬂuence protein–protein interactions (381). For example, aluminum may
bind to calmodulin, a calcium-activated regulatory protein that controls the activity of more than 40
diﬀerent enzymes by binding to them via hydrophobic interactions resulting in the induction or inhi-
bition of activity. Aluminum binding does not aﬀect calcium binding to calmodulin; rather, aluminum
induces  conformational  changes  that  inhibit  the  ability  of  calmodulin  to  bind  target  proteins.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Aluminum also can cross-link proteins by forming intermolecular bridges between binding sites on
amino acid side chains. The binding of aluminum to proteins may also aﬀect their turnover, either sta-
bilizing them, such as in insoluble aggregates, or enhancing degradation via conformational changes.
Since many signal transduction processes involve phosphate group transfers, this is another likely
site for aluminum toxicity (382). The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) signaling pathway
has been inhibited by aluminum. Aluminum apparently binds to phosphate groups of PIP2 in mem-
brane phospholipids inhibiting PIP2 hydrolysis by phospholipase C. An alteration in signal transduc-
tion  pathways  may  help  explain  the  altered  pattern  of  gene  expression  seen  in  tissues  exposed  to
aluminum (383). G-proteins and protein kinases are also reportedly aﬀected by aluminum (383).

Aluminum has been shown to interfere with iron metabolism. It blocks the incorporation of iron
into heme resulting in poor hemoglobin production and anemia (384). Aluminum also appears to dis-
rupt the mechanisms that control intracellular iron homeostasis. The result may be altered iron dis-
tribution in the cell leading to increased levels of reactive or “free” iron and iron-induced oxidative
stress (384–386). Normally, increasing intracellular “free” iron concentrations coordinately stimulate
the synthesis of the iron storage protein ferritin, and inhibit the synthesis of transferrin receptors that
control iron uptake. Studies suggest that aluminum antagonizes the ability of intracellular iron to reg-
ulate the translation of mRNAs for both ferritin and the transferrin receptor. Under these conditions,
the  amount  of  “free” iron  in  the  cell  becomes  elevated  relative  to  the  amount  of  its  storage  and
detoxiﬁcation by ferritin, thus increasing the risk for iron-induced oxidative stress. Aluminium has
also been shown to inhibit the ATP-dependent proton pump on endosomes, resulting in the trapping
of transferrin-bound iron inside these vesicles. The trapping of iron would limit its ability to stimu-
late  ferritin  synthesis. Aluminium  may  also  inhibit  the  incorporation  of  iron  into  ferritin, further
increasing the levels of reactive “free” iron in the cell.

Recent studies have shown that aluminum can induce oxidative stress even though it is not a redox
metal, and that antioxidants can attenuate this eﬀect supporting the concept that aluminum toxicity
involves oxidative damage (387,388). Oxidative stress could result from altered membrane structure,
a reduction in antioxidant defense systems, or the induction of free radical generating systems such as
increased levels of reactive “free” iron.

16.11 ALUMINUM CONCENTRATIONS

16.11.1 IN PLANT TISSUES

16.11.1.1 Aluminum in Roots

Increasing aluminum levels in the medium tended to result in increasing aluminum concentrations
in  roots  of  aluminum  accumulators  or  aluminum  excluders  (Table  16.3).  Concentrations  of  alu-
minum in roots were 2- to 250-fold higher than those in shoots (Table 16.3). In red spruce, root alu-
minum  concentrations  associated  with  a  20%  decrease  in  root  biomass  ranged  from  1700  to
6000 mg Al kg⫺1 (78). Aluminum in roots is present mostly as precipitated hydroxy or phosphate
compounds outside the root cells (86). As a result, it is diﬃcult to use aluminum concentrations in
roots as a measure of aluminum toxicity unless an eﬀort is made to remove or prevent extracellu-
larly precipitated and adsorbed aluminum. Alternatively, it might be possible to analyze aluminum
concentrations in root apices alone as a measure of toxicity (189–191).

16.11.1.2 Aluminum in Shoots
In accumulators, foliar aluminum concentrations of 65 tree species and 12 unidentiﬁed trees from
an Indonesian rain forest ranged from 1 g kg⫺1 in delta tree (Aporusa spp. Blume, Euphorbiaceae)
to 37 g kg⫺1 in Maschalocorymbosus corymbosus Bremek. (Rubiaceae) (13). Aluminum accumula-
tors  (Melastoma  malabathricum L., Hydrangea  macrophylla Ser., and  Fagopyrum  esculentum
Moench.) exposed to increasing aluminum in solution showed increasing aluminum concentrations
in  leaves  (22)  (Figure  16.7).  Facultative  aluminum  accumulators, jack  pine  (Pinus  banksiana

Lamb.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), also had increasing foliar aluminum concentrations as
solution aluminum increased (389) (Table 16.3).

Eﬀorts to establish critical aluminum concentrations for toxicity in plants generally have been
unsuccessful (78,82,390). For example, foliar concentrations in red spruce associated with a 20%
decrease in foliar biomass ranged from 70 to 250 mg kg⫺1 (78). Similarly, foliar aluminum concen-
trations in red oak associated with a 20% decrease in leaf biomass ranged from 93 to 188 mg kg⫺1
(391). Within  slash  pine  families, aluminum  sensitivity  was  correlated  positively  with  foliar  alu-
minum concentration; however, no such correlation was found within loblolly pine families (392).

In accumulators, internal complexation of aluminum by organic anions, silicate, or other lig-
ands resulted in poor correlations between foliar aluminum concentrations and restrictions in bio-
mass growth. Raynal et al. (78) reported the absence of any signiﬁcant correlation between biomass
response and foliar aluminum levels in Pinus species. In the case of aluminum excluders, aluminum
concentrations  in  shoots  do  not  increase  with  increasing  aluminum  levels  in  the  medium  until  a
toxic  threshold  is  exceeded  (328), again  resulting  in  poor  correlation  between  foliar  aluminum
levels and biomass response. For example, in rice and barley, only trace amounts of aluminum were
found  in  leaves  at  solution  aluminum  levels  up  to  111 µM, then  foliar  aluminum  concentrations
increased as aluminum levels in solution increased to 555 µM (22) (Figure 16.7). Similarly, increas-
ing  solution  aluminum  levels  from  0  to  620 µM  had  no  eﬀect  on  biomass  growth  of  Western
hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla Sarg.), then foliar aluminum concentrations decreased from 300 to
250 mg  kg⫺1 when  biomass  was  aﬀected  adversely  by  solution  aluminum  (393).  In  sugar  maple

(Acer saccharum Marsh.), aluminum concentrations in leaves increased from 50 to 200 mg kg⫺1 as
aluminum levels in solution increased from 0 to 600 µM, but then foliar aluminum concentration
dropped to 150 mg kg⫺1 when shoot growth was restricted at 1000 µM aluminum in solution (394).
Other examples of a lack of correlation between aluminum-induced growth inhibition and foliar
aluminum concentrations can be found in Table 16.3 (395–399).

16.11.2 SOIL ANALYSIS
Aluminum bioavailability in soils and toxicity to plants is diﬃcult to quantify because toxic levels
vary with species and even with cultivars within a species (82). For example, 1.5 µM Al3⫹ activity
was reportedly toxic to cotton roots (294), and 4.0 µM Al3⫹ was toxic for coﬀee (32). For rice, an
aluminum-tolerant crop, the critical Al3⫹ activity was approximately 100 µM (400).

Chemical composition of some soil solutions, including aluminum and its various species, is
listed in Table 16.4 (294). Table 16.5 lists critical Al3⫹ activities, as measured by root elongation,
for  selected  plants  (401).  In  general, trees  are  more  tolerant  of  aluminum  than  most  agronomic
crops (Table 16.5). For 2-year-old seedlings of Norway spruce, aluminum toxicity was not evident
when Al3⫹ activities in soil solutions ranged from 7.7 to 64.3 µM (402).

Instead of using Al3⫹ activity as the sole indicator of phytotoxicity, Alva et al. (34) used the sum
0 ⫹
⫹). They observed 50% reductions in root elongation, relative to roots of plants not receiving

of  the  activities  of  monomeric  aluminum  species  (Al3 ⫹ ⫹ AlOH2 ⫹ ⫹ Al(OH)2

17.1 INTRODUCTION
Cobalt has long been known to be a micronutrient for animals, including human beings, where it is
a constituent of vitamin B12 (1). However, its presence and function has not been recorded to the
same extent in higher plants as in animals, leading to the suggestion that vegetarians and herbivo-
rous animals need to ingest extra cobalt or vitamin B12 in diets to prevent deﬁciency. Vitamin B12 is
synthesized in some bacteria, but not in animals and plants (1). Intestinal absorption and subsequent
plasma transport of vitamin B12 are mediated by speciﬁc vitamin B12 proteins and their receptors in
mammals. Vitamin B12, taken up by the cells, is converted enzymatically into methyl and adenosyl
vitamin B12, which function as coenzymes. Feeding trials of cattle (Bos taurus L.), which also suﬀer
from vitamin B12 deﬁciency, show that the normal diet is deﬁcient in cobalt to the extent that sup-
plemental provision of the element can improve their performance, something that could also be
achieved by feeding them feedstuﬀs grown in cobalt-rich soil (2).

The only physiological role so far deﬁnitely attributed to cobalt in higher plants has been in

nitrogen ﬁxation by leguminous plants (3).

17.2 DISTRIBUTION

17.2.1 MICROORGANISMS AND LOWER PLANTS

17.2.1.1 Algae

Cobalt is essential for many microorganisms including cyanobacteria (blue–green algae). It forms
part of cobalamin, a component of several enzymes in nitrogen-ﬁxing microorganisms, whether free-
living or in symbiosis. It is required for symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation by the root nodule bacteria of
legumes (3). Soybeans grown with 0.1 µg L⫺1 cobalt with atmospheric nitrogen and no mineral nitro-
gen showed rapid nitrogen ﬁxation and growth (4). Cobalt is distributed widely in algae, including
microalgae, Chlorella, Spirulina, Cytseira barbera, and Ascophyllum nodosum. Alginates, such as
fucoiden, in the cell wall play an important role in binding cobalt in the cell-wall structure (5,6).

Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in aquatic macrophytes growing in streams and ponds around
slag dumps has led to high levels of cobalt (7). Certain marine species such as diatoms (Septifer
virgatus Wiegman) and brown algae Sargassum horneri (Turner) and S. thunbergii (Kuntze) from
the Japanese coast act as bioindicators of cobalt (8). Accumulation has been shown to be controlled
by salinity of the medium with bladder wrack (brown alga, Fucus vesiculosus L.) (9).

The cell walls of plants, including those of algae, have the capacity to bind metals at negatively
charged sites. The wild type of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dangeard, owing to the presence of its
cell wall, was more tolerant to metals such as cobalt, copper, cadmium, and nickel, than the wall-
less variant (10). When exposed to metals, singly in solutions for 24 h, cells of both strains accu-
mulated  the  metals.  Absorbed  metals  not  removed  by  chelation  with  EDTA–CaC12 wash  were
considered strongly bound. Cobalt and nickel were present in signiﬁcantly higher amounts loosely
bound  to  the  walled  organism  than  in  the  wall-less  ones.  It  was  concluded  that  metal  ions  were
aﬀected by the chelating molecules in walled algae, which limited the capacity of the metal to pen-
etrate the cell. Thus, algae appear to contain a complex mechanism involving internal and external
detoxiﬁcation of metal ions (10).

In a ﬂow-through wetland treatment system to treat coal combustion leachates from an electri-
cal power system using cattails (Typha latifolia L.), cobalt and nickel in water decreased by an aver-
age of 39 and 47% in the ﬁrst year and 98 and 63% in the second year, respectively. Plants took up
0.19% of the cobalt salts per year. Submerged Chara (a freshwater microalga), however, took up
2.75% of the salts, and considerably higher concentrations of metals were associated with cattail
roots than shoots (11).

17.2.1.2 Fungi

In fungi, cobalt accumulates by two processes. The essential process is a metabolically independent
one presumably involving the cell surface. Accumulation may reach 400 mg g⫺1 of yeast and is rapid
in Neurospora crassa Shear & BO Dodge (12,13).

In the next step, which is metabolism dependent, progressive uptake of large amounts of cations
takes place. Two potassium ions are released for each Co2⫹ ion taken up in freshly prepared yeast-
cell  suspensions.  The  Co2⫹ appears  to  accumulate  via  a  cation-uptake  system.  Its  uptake  is
speciﬁcally related to the ionic radius of the cation (14). Accumulated cobalt is transported (at the
rate of 40 µg h⫺1 100 mg⫺1 dry weight of N. crassa) mainly into the intercellular space and vac-
uoles (13,15). Acidity and temperature of media are factors involved in Co2⫹ uptake and transport.
In  N.  crassa, Mg2⫹ inhibits  Co2⫹ uptake  and  transport, suggesting  that  the  processes  of  the  two
cations are interrelated. In yeast cells exposed to elevated concentrations of cobalt, uptake is sup-
pressed, and intercellular distribution is altered (15).

Yeast mitochondria passively accumulate Co2⫹ in levels linearly proportional to its concentra-
tion  in  the  medium.  The  density  of  mitochondria  is  slightly  increased  and  their  appearance  is
altered, based on observations with electron microscopy (16). The more dense mitochondria are
exchanged by hyphal fusion in the fully compatible common A and common AB matings of tetrap-
olar basidiomycetes Schizophyllum commune Fries, but not in the common B matings (17). Toxicity
and the barrier eﬀect of the cell wall inhibit surface binding of Co2⫹. As a result, isolated protoplasts
from yeast-like cells of hyphae and chlamydospores of Aureobasidium pollulans were more sensi-
tive to intracellular cobalt uptake than intact cells and chlamydospores (18).

17.2.1.3 Moss

The absorption and retention of heavy metals in the woodland moss Hylocomium splendens Hedw
followed the order of Cu, Pb⬎Ni⬎Co⬎Zn, and Mn within a wide range of concentrations and was
independent of the addition of the ions (19).

17.2.2 HIGHER PLANTS
Cobalt is not known to be deﬁnitely essential for higher plants. Vitamin B12 is neither produced nor
absorbed by higher plants. It is synthesized by soil bacteria, intestinal microbes, and algae. In nat-
urally cobalt-rich areas, cobalt accumulates in plants in a species-speciﬁc manner. Plants such as
astragalus (Astragalus spp. L.) may accumulate from 2 or 3 to 100 mg kg⫺1 dried plant mass. Cobalt
occurs  in  a  high  concentration  in  the  style  and  stigma  of  Lilium  longifolium Thunb.  It  was  not
detected in the ﬂowers of green beans (Phaseolus sativus L.) and radishes (Raphanus sativus L.)
though the leaves of the latter contain it. It was shown to occur in high amounts in leafy plants such
as lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.), and spinach (Spinacea
oleracea L.) (above 0.6 ppm) by Kloke (20). Forage plants contain 0.6 to 3.5 mg Co kg⫺1 and cere-
als 2.2 mg kg⫺1 (21). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) contains 0.02 to 0.150 mg kg⫺1 plant mass (22).

Cobalt chloride markedly increases elongation of etiolated pea stems when supplied with indole
acetic acid (IAA) and sucrose, but elongation is inhibited by cobalt acetate. Cobalt in the form of
vitamin B12 is necessary for the growth of excised tumor tissue from spruce (Picea glauca Voss.) cul-
tured in vitro. It increases the apparent rate of synthesis of peroxides and prevents the peroxidative

destruction of IAA. It counteracts the inhibition by dinitrophenol (DNP) in oxidative phosphoryla-
tion and reduces activity of ATPase and is known to be an activator of plant enzymes such as car-
boxylases and peptidases (4). The Co2⫹ ion is also an inhibitor of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway,
blocking the conversion of 1-amino-cyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC) (23).

17.3 ABSORPTION
Kinetic studies of cobalt absorption by excised roots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) exhibited a Q10
of 2.2 in a concentration range of 1 to100 µM CoCl2. It has been suggested that a number of car-
rier sites are available, which are concentration dependent (24). Entry of divalent cations in the roots
of maize is accompanied by a decrease in the pH of the incubation media and of the cell sap and
also a decrease in the malate content (25). The uptake by diﬀerent species probably depends on the
various physiological and biological needs of the species (26,27).

Accumulation of cobalt by forage plants has been studied in wetlands, grasslands, and forests
close to landﬁlls and mines (11,28,29). Irrigation with cobalt-rich water in meadows has shown high
intake of cobalt, which was also demonstrated in the blood serum and plasma of bulls fed on the
hay grown in the  ﬁeld (29). African buﬀalos (Syncerus caffer Sparrman) in the Kruger National
Park (KNP) downwind of mining and reﬁning of cobalt, copper, and manganese showed the pres-
ence of the metals in liver in amounts related signiﬁcantly to age and gender diﬀerences (30).

17.4 UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT

17.4.1 ABSORPTION AS RELATED TO PROPERTIES OF PLANTS
The molecular basis of metal transport through membranes has been studied by several workers.
Korshunova et al. (31) reported that IRT 1, an Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh (mouse-ear cress) metal-
ion transporter, could facilitate manganese absorption by a yeast mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Meyen ex E.C. Hansen strain defective in manganese uptake (smﬂ delta). The IRT 1 protein has
been identiﬁed as a transporter for iron and manganese and is inhibited by cadmium and zinc. The
IRT 1 cDNA also complements a Zn-uptake-deﬁcient yeast mutant. It is therefore suggested that
IRT 1 protein is a broad-range metal-ion transporter in plants (31).

Macﬁe and Welbourn (10) reviewed the function of cell wall as a barrier to the uptake of several
metal  ions  in  unicellular  green  algae. The  cell  walls  of  plants, including  those  of  algae, have  the
capacity to bind metal ions in negatively charged sites. As mentioned above, the wild-type (walled)
strain of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dangeard was more tolerant to cobalt
than a wall-less mutant of the same species. In a study to determine if tolerance to metals was asso-
ciated  with  an  increased  absorption, absorbed  metal  was  deﬁned  as  that  fraction  that  could  be
removed with a solution of Na-EDTA and CaCl2. The fraction that remained after the EDTA–CaCl2
wash was considered strongly bound in the cell. When exposed to metals, singly, in solution for 24 h,
cells of both strains accumulated the metals. Signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of cobalt were in the
loosely bound fraction of the walled strain than in the wall-less strain.

Passive diﬀusion and active transport are involved in the passage of Co2⫹ through cortical cells.
A comparison of concentration of Co2⫹ in the cytoplasm and vacuoles indicates that active trans-
port occurs outward from the cytoplasm at the plasmalemma and also into the vacuoles at the tono-
plast.  Light–dark  cycles  play  an  important  role  in  transport  through  the  cortical  cells  of  wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) (32). A small amount of absorption at a linear rate takes place in the water-
free space, Donnan-free space, and cytoplasm in continuous light, whereas a complete inhibition of
absorption occurs during the dark periods (32). In ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), 15% of the Co2⫹
absorbed  was  transported  to  the  shoot  after  72 h.  Absorption  and  transport  of  Co2⫹ markedly
increased with increasing pH of the solution, but were not aﬀected by water ﬂux through the plants.
With 0.1 µM Co2⫹ treatment, concentration of cobalt in the cytoplasm was regulated by an eﬄux

CRC_DK2972_Ch017.qxd  6/30/2006  1:44 PM  Page 503

Cobalt

503

pump at the plasmalemma and by an inﬂux pump at the tonoplast. Stored cobalt in the vacuole was
not available for transport (33).

Cobalt tends to accumulate in roots, but free Co2⫹ inhibited hydrolysis of Mg-ATP and protein
transport in corn-root tonoplast vesicles (34). ATP complexes of Co2⫹ inhibited proton pumping,
and the eﬀect was modulated by free Co2⫹. Free cations aﬀected the structure of the lipid phase in
the  tonoplast  membrane, possibly  by  interaction  with  a  protogenic  domain  of  the  membrane
through an indirect link mechanism (34).

Upward transport of cobalt is principally by the transpirational ﬂow in the xylem (35). Usually,
the shoot receives about 10% of the cobalt absorbed by the roots, most of which is stored in the cor-
tical cell vacuoles and removed from the transport pathway (32). Distribution along the axis of the
shoot decreases acropetally (36). Cobalt is bound to an organic compound of negative overall charge
and molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 5000 and is transported through the sieve tubes of cas-
tor bean (Ricinus communis L.) (37). Excess cobalt leads to thick callose deposits on sieve plates of
the  phloem  in  white  bean  (Phaseolus  vulgaris L.)  seedlings, possibly  reducing  the  transport  of 
14C assimilates signiﬁcantly (38).

The distribution of cobalt in speciﬁc organs indicates a decreasing concentration gradient from the
root to the stem and from the leaf to the fruit. This gradient decreases from the root to the stem and
leaves in bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and Chrysanthemum (39,40). No strong gradient occurs
from the stem to the leaves because of the low mobility of cobalt in plants, leading to its transport to
leaves in only small amounts (41,42). In seeds of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.), concentrations of
cobalt are higher in cotyledons and embryo than in seed coats (43). The distribution depends on the
phase of development of the plant. At the early phase of growth of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) on
lixiviated (washed) black earth, large quantities of cobalt are accumulated in the leaves and stalks (44),
whereas before ﬂowering and during the ripening of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the largest amount
is in the nodules. Plant organs contain cobalt in the following increasing order: root, leaves, seed, and
stems (44). During ﬂowering, a large amount shifts to the tuber of potato and, in the case of beans, to
ﬂowers, followed by nodules, roots, leaves, and stems. Movement is more rapid in a descending direc-
tion than in an ascending one (36). The cobalt content was observed to be higher in pickled cucumber
(Cucumis sativus L.) than in young fresh fruit (45). In grains of lupins (Lupinus spp. L.) and wheat, the
concentration varied with the amount of rainfall and soil types (46).

17.4.2 ABSORPTION AS RELATED TO PROPERTIES OF SOIL
Soil pH has a major eﬀect on the uptake of cobalt, manganese, and nickel, which become more
available to plants as the pH decreases. Increase in soil pH reduces the cobalt content of ryegrass
(Lolium spp.) (47). Reducing conditions in poorly drained soils enhance the rate of weathering of
ferromagnesian  minerals, releasing  cobalt, nickel, and  vanadium  (48).  Liming  decreased  cobalt
mobility in soil (49). The presence of humus facilitates cobalt accumulation in soil, but lowers its
absorption by plants. Five percent humus has been shown to decrease cobalt content by one-half or
two-thirds in cultures (50).

High manganese levels in soil inhibit accumulation of cobalt by plants (51). Manganese diox-
ides in soil have a high sorption capacity and accumulate a large amount of cobalt from the soil
solution. Much of the cobalt in the soil is ﬁxed in this way and is thus not available to plants (52).
Water logging of the soil increases cobalt uptake in French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize
(Zea mays L.) (53).

17.4.3 ACCUMULATION AS RELATED TO THE RHIZOSPHERE
Cobalt may be absorbed through the leaf in coniferous forests, but the majority is through the soil, espe-
cially in wetlands. The physicochemical status of transition metals such as cobalt in the rhizosphere is
entirely  diﬀerent  from  that  in  the  bulk  soil. A  microenvironment  is  created  around  the  root  system 

CRC_DK2972_Ch017.qxd  6/30/2006  1:44 PM  Page 504

504

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

(e.g., wheat and maize), characterized by an accumulation of root-derived organic material with a grad-
ual shift from ionic metal to higher-molecular weight forms such as cobalt, manganese, and zinc. These
three metals are increasingly complexed throughout the growth period. Fallow soil has been shown to
complex lower amounts (6.4%) of tracers (57Co) than cropped soil, 61% for maize and 31% for wheat
(54). Cobalt has a stimulatory eﬀect on the microﬂora of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) rhizosphere,
shown by an intensiﬁcation of the immobilization of nitrogen and mineralization of phosphorus (55).
Cobalt status in moist soil from the root zone of ﬁeld-grown barley shows seasonal variation, being low
in late winter and higher in spring and early summer. Discrete maxima are achieved frequently between
May and early July, depending on the extent of the development of the growing crop and on seasonal
inﬂuences. Increased concentration may result from the mobilization of the micronutrient from insolu-
ble forms by biologically produced chelating ligands.

17.5 COBALT METABOLISM IN PLANTS
Interactions between cobalt and several essential enzymes have been demonstrated in plants and ani-
mals. Two metal-bound intermediates formed by Co2⫹ activate ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxy-
lase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39). Studies by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy have
shown  the  activity  to  be  dependent  on  the  concentration  of  ribulose  1,5  bisphosphate  (23).  This
ﬁnding  suggested  that  the  enzyme–metal  coordinated  ribulose  1,5  bisphosphate  and  an
enzyme–metal coordinated enediolate anion of it, where bound ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate appears
ﬁrst, constitute the two EPR detectable intermediates, respectively.

Ganson and Jensen (56) showed that the prime molecular target of glyphosate (N-[phospho-
nomethyl]glycine), a  potent  herbicide  and  antimicrobial  agent, is  known  to  be  the  shikimate-
pathway enzyme 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthetase. Inhibition by glyphosate of an
earlier  pathway  enzyme  that  is  located  in  the  cytosol  of  higher  plants, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-
heptulosonate-7 phosphate synthase (DS-Co), has raised the possibility of dual enzyme targets
in  vivo.  Since  the  observation  that  magnesium  or  manganese  can  replace  cobalt  as  the  divalent-
metal activator of DS-Co, it has now been possible to show that the sensitivity of DS-Co to inhibi-
tion  by  glyphosate  is  obligately  dependent  on  the  presence  of  cobalt.  Evidence  for  a
cobalt(II):glyphosate complex with octahedral coordination was obtained through examination of
the eﬀect of glyphosate on the visible electronic spectrum of aqueous solutions of CoCl2.

Two  inhibition  targets  of  cobalt  and  nickel  were  studied  on  oxidation–reduction  enzymes  of
spinach  (Spinacia  oleracea L.)  thylakoids.  Compounds  of  complex  ions  and  coordination  com-
pounds of cobalt and chromium were synthesized and characterized (57). Their chemical structures
and  the  oxidation  states  of  their  metal  centers  remained  unchanged  in  solution.  Neither
chromium(III) chloride (CrC13) nor hexamminecobalt(III) chloride [Co(NH3)6C13] inhibited pho-
tosynthesis. Some other coordination compounds inhibited ATP synthesis and electron ﬂow (basal
phosphorylating, and uncoupled) behaving as Hill-reaction inhibitors, with the compounds target-
ing electron transport from photosystem II (P680 to plastoquinones, QA and QB, and cytochrome).
The ﬁnal step in hydrocarbon biosynthesis involves the loss of cobalt from a fatty aldehyde (58).
This decarbonylation is catalyzed by microsomes from Botyrococcus braunii. The puriﬁed enzyme
releases nearly one mole of cobalt for each mole of hydrocarbon. Electron microprobe analysis
revealed that the enzyme contains cobalt. Puriﬁcation of the decarbonylase from B. braunii grown
in  57CoCl2 showed  that  57Co  co-eluted  with  the  decarbonylase.  These  results  indicate  that  the
enzyme contains cobalt that might be part of a Co-porphyrin, although a corrin structure (as in
vitamin B12) cannot be ruled out. These results strongly suggest that biosynthesis of hydrocarbons
is  eﬀected  by  a  microsomal  Co-porphyrin-containing  enzyme  that  catalyzes  decarbonylation  of
aldehydes and, thus, reveals a biological function for cobalt in plants (58).

The  role  of  hydrogen  bonding  in  soybean  (Glycine  max Merr.)  leghemoglobin  was  studied
(59,60).  Two  spectroscopically  distinct  forms  of  oxycobaltous  soybean  leghemoglobin
(oxyCoLb), acid and neutral, were identiﬁed by electron spin echo envelope modulation. In the

CRC_DK2972_Ch017.qxd  6/30/2006  1:44 PM  Page 505

Cobalt

505

acid form, a coupling to 2H was noted, indicating the presence of a hydrogen bond to bound oxy-
gen.  No  coupled  2H  occurred  in  the  neutral  form  (60).  The  oxidation–reduction  enzymes  of
spinach thylakoids are also aﬀected by chromium and cobalt (23,57).

The copper chaperone for the superoxide dismutase (CCS) gene encodes a protein that is believed
to  deliver  copper  to  Cu–Zn  superoxide  dismutase  (CuZnSOD).  The  CCS  proteins  from  diﬀerent
organisms share high sequence homology and consist of three distinct domains, a CuZnSOD-like cen-
tral domain ﬂanked by two domains, which contain putative metal-binding motifs. The Co2⫹-binding
properties of proteins from arabidopsis and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were character-
ized by UV–visible and circular dichroism spectroscopies and were shown to bind one or two cobalt
ions depending on the type of protein. The cobalt-binding site that was common in both proteins dis-
played spectroscopic characteristics of Co2⫹ bound to cysteine ligands (61).

The inhibition of photoreduction reactions by exogenous manganese chloride (MnCl2) in Tris-
treated photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments has been used to probe for amino acids on the
PSII  reaction-center  proteins, including  the  ones  that  provide  ligands  for  binding  manganese
(62,63). Inhibition of photooxidation may involve two diﬀerent types of high-aﬃnity, manganese-
binding components: (a) one that is speciﬁc for manganese, and (b) others that bind manganese, but
may also bind additional divalent cations such as zinc and cobalt that are not photooxidized by PSII.
Roles for cobalt or zinc in PSII have not been proposed, however.

17.6 EFFECT OF COBALT IN PLANTS ON ANIMALS
Cobalt uptake by plants allows its access to animals. Kosla (29) demonstrated the eﬀect of irriga-
tion of meadows with the water of the river Ner in Poland on the levels of iron, manganese, and
cobalt in the soil and vegetation. Experiments were also carried out on young bulls (Bos taurus L.)
fed with the hay grown on these meadows. The levels of iron and cobalt were determined in the
blood plasma, and manganese level in the hair of the bulls. The irrigation caused an increase of the
cobalt content in the soil, but had no eﬀect on cobalt content in the plants or in the blood plasma of
the bulls. Webb et al. (30) stated that animals may act as bioindicators for the pollution of soil, air,
and water. To monitor changes over time, a baseline status should be established for a particular
species in a particular area. The concentration of minerals in soil is a poor indicator of mineral accu-
mulation by plants and availability to animals.

The chemical composition of the body tissue, particularly the liver, is a better reﬂection of the
dietary status of domestic and wild animals. Normal values for copper, manganese, and cobalt in the
liver have been established for cattle, but not for African buﬀalo. As part of the bovine-tuberculosis
(BTB) monitoring program in the KNP in South Africa, 660 buﬀalo were culled. Livers were ran-
domly sampled in buﬀered formalin for mineral analysis. The highest concentrations of copper in liv-
ers were measured in the northern and central parts of the KNP, which is downwind of mining and
reﬁning  activities.  Manganese, cobalt, and  selenium  levels  in  the  liver  samples  indicated  neither
excess nor deﬁciency although there were some signiﬁcant area, age, and gender diﬀerences. It was
felt that these data could serve as a baseline reference for monitoring variations in the level and extent
of mineral pollution on natural pastures close to mines and reﬁneries. Cobalt is routinely added to
cattle feed, and deﬁciency diseases are known. Of interest also are the possible eﬀects of minor and
trace elements in Indian herbal and medicinal preparations (64).

17.7 INTERACTION OF COBALT WITH METALS AND OTHER 

CHEMICALS IN MINERAL METABOLISM

The interaction of cobalt with other metals depends to a major extent on the concentration of the met-
als used. The cytotoxic and phytotoxic responses of a single metal or combinations are considered in
terms of common periodic relations and physicochemical properties, including electronic structure,

CRC_DK2972_Ch017.qxd  6/30/2006  1:44 PM  Page 506

506

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

ion parameters (charge–size relations), and coordination. But, the relationships among toxicity, posi-
tions, and properties of these elements are very speciﬁc and complex (65). The mineral elements in
plants as ions or as constituents or organic molecules are of importance in plant metabolism. Iron,
copper, and zinc are prosthetic groups in certain plant enzymes. Magnesium, manganese, and cobalt
may act as inhibitors or as activators. Cobalt may compete with ions in the biochemical reactions of
several plants (66,67).

17.7.1 IRON
Many trace elements in high doses induce iron deﬁciency in plants (68). Combinations of increased
cobalt and zinc in bush beans have led to iron deﬁciency (69). Excess metals accumulated in shoots,
and  especially  in  roots, reduce  ion  absorption  and  distribution  in  these  organs, followed  by  the
induction of chlorosis, decrease in catalase activity, and increase in nonreducing sugar concentra-
tion  in  barley  (70,71).  Supplying  chelated  iron  ethylenediamine  di(o-hydroxyphenyl)  acetic  acid
[Fe-(EDDHA),]  could  not  overcome  these  toxic  eﬀects  in  Phaseolus spp.  L.  (72).  Simultaneous
addition of cobalt and zinc to iron-stressed sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) resulted in preferential
transport of cobalt into leaves followed by ready transport of both metals into the leaf symplasts
within 48 h (73). A binuclear binding site for iron, zinc, and cobalt has been observed (74).

17.7.2 ZINC
Competitive absorption and mutual activation between zinc and cobalt during transport of one or
the other element toward the part above the ground were recorded in pea (Pisum sativum L.) and
wheat seedlings (75). Enrichment of fodder beet (Beta vulgaris L.) seeds before sowing with one
of these cations lowers the content of the other in certain organs and tissues. It is apparently not the
result of a simple antagonism of the given cations in the process of redistribution in certain organs
and tissue, but is explained by a similar eﬀect of cobalt and zinc as seen when the aldolase and car-
bonic anhydrase activities and intensity of the assimilators’ transport are determined (76).

Cobalt tends to interact with zinc, especially in high doses, to aﬀect nutrient accumulation (77). The
antagonism is sometimes related to induced nutrient deﬁciency (69). In bush beans, however, cobalt
suppressed to some extent the ability of high concentration of zinc to depress accumulation of potas-
sium, calcium, and magnesium. The protective eﬀect was stated to be the result of zinc depressing the
leaf concentration of cobalt rather than the other nutrients (69). Substitution of Zn2⫹ by Co2⫹ reduces
speciﬁcity of Zn2⫹ metalloenzyme acylamino-acid-amido hydrolase in Aspergillus oryzae Cohn (78).

17.7.3 CADMIUM
Combinations of elements may be toxic in plants when the individual ones are not (72). Trace elements
usually  give  protective  eﬀects  at  low  concentrations  because  some  trace  elements  antagonize  the
uptake  of  others  at  relatively  low  levels.  For  example, trace  elements  in  various  combinations
(Cu–Ni–Zn, Ni–Co–Zn–Cd, Cu–Ni–Co–Cd, Cu–Co–Zn–Cd, Cu–Ni–Zn–Cd, and Cu–Ni–Co–Zn–Cd)
on growth of bush beans protected against the toxicity of cadmium. It was suggested that part of the
protection could be due to cobalt suppressing the uptake of cadmium by roots. Other trace elements in
turn suppressed the uptake of cobalt by roots (69). These ﬁve trace elements illustrated diﬀerential par-
titioning between roots and shoots (40). The binding of toxic concentration of cobalt in the cell wall of
the ﬁlamentous fungus (Cunninghamella blackesleeana Lender) was totally inhibited and suppressed
by trace elements (79).

17.7.4 COPPER
The biphasic mechanism involved in the uptake of copper by barley roots after 2 h was increased
with  16  µM  Co2⫹, but  after  24 h, a  monophasic  pattern  developed  with  lower  values  of  copper
absorption, indicating an inﬂuence of Co2⫹ on the uptake site (80).

17.7.5 MANGANESE
Cobalt and zinc increased the accumulation of manganese in the shoots of bush beans grown for
3 weeks in a stimulated calcareous soil containing Yolo loam and 2% CaCO3 (40).

17.7.6 CHROMIUM AND TIN
The inhibitory eﬀects of chromium and tin on growth, uptake of NO3
⫹, nitrate reductase,
and  glutamine  synthetase  activity  of  the  cyanobacterium  (Anabaena  doliolum Bharadwaja)  was
enhanced when nickel, cobalt, and zinc were used in combination with test metals in the growth
medium in the following degree: Ni⬎Co⬎Zn (81).

⫺ and NH4

17.7.7 MAGNESIUM
The  activating  eﬀect  of  cobalt  on  Mg2⫹-dependent  activity  of  glutamine  synthetase  by  the
blue–green alga Spirulina platensis Geitler may be considered as an important eﬀect. Its eﬀect in
maintaining the activity of the enzyme in vivo is independent of ATP (82).

17.7.8 SULFUR
The mold Cunninghamella blackesleeana Lendner, grown in the presence of toxic concentration of
cobalt, showed elevated content of sulfur in the mycelia. Its cell wall contained higher concentra-
tions of phosphate and chitosan, citrulline, and cystothionine as the main cell wall proteins (79).

17.7.9 NICKEL
In moss (Timmiella anomala Limpricht), nickel overcomes the inhibitory eﬀect of cobalt on pro-
tonemal growth whereas cobalt reduces the same eﬀect of nickel on bud number (83).

17.7.10 CYANIDE
Cyanide in soil was toxic to bush beans and also resulted in the increased uptake of the toxic ele-
ments such as copper, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, titanium, and, to a slight extent, iron. The phyto-
toxicity from cyanide or the metals led to increased transfer of sodium to the leaves and roots (40).

17.8 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF COBALT ON PLANTS

17.8.1 SENESCENCE
Senescence in lettuce leaf in the dark is retarded by cobalt, which acts by arresting the decline of
chlorophyll, protein, RNA and, to a lesser extent, DNA. The activities of RNAase and protease, and
tissue permeability were decreased, while the activity of catalase increased (84). Cobalt delays age-
ing and is used for keeping leaves fresh in vetch (Vicia spp.) (85). It is also used in keeping fruits
such as apple fresh (86).

17.8.2 DROUGHT RESISTANCE
Presowing  treatment  of  seeds  with  cobalt  nitrate  increased  drought  resistance  of  horse  chestnut
(Aesculus hippocastanum L.) from the Donets Basin in southeastern Europe (87).

17.8.3 ALKALOID ACCUMULATION
Alkaloid accumulation in medicinal plants such as downy thorn apple Datura innoxia Mill. (88),
Atropa  caucasica (89), belladonna  A.  belladonna L.  (90), and  horned  poppy  Glaucium  ﬂavum
Crantz (91) is regulated by cobalt. It also increased rutin (11.6%) and cyanide (67%) levels in diﬀerent
species of buckwheat (Fagopyrum sagittatum Gilib., F. tataricum Gaertn., and F. emargitatum) (89,92).

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

17.8.4 VASE LIFE
Shelf and vase life of marigold (Tagetes patula L.), chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum spp.), rose
(Rosa spp.), and maidenhair fern (Adiantum spp.) is increased by cobalt. Cobalt also has a long-
lasting  eﬀect  in  preserving  apple  (Malus  domestica Borkh.).  The  fruits  are  kept  fresh  by  cobalt
application after picking (86,93–96).

17.8.5 BIOCIDAL AND ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY
Cobalt acts as a chelator of salicylidine-o-aminothiophenol (SATP) and salicylidine-o-aminopyri-
dine (SAP) and exerts biocidal activity against the molds Aspergillus nidulans Winter and A. niger
Tiegh and the yeast Candida albicans (97). Antifungal activities of Co2⫹ with acetone salicyloyl
hydrazone (ASH) and ethyl methyl ketone salicyloyl hydrazone (ESH) against A. niger and A. ﬂavus
have been established by Johari et al. (98).

17.8.6 ETHYLENE BIOSYNTHESIS
Cobalt inhibits IAA-induced ethylene production in gametophores of the ferns Pteridium aquilinum
Kuhn and sporophytes of ferns Matteneuccia struthiopteris Tod. and Polystichum munitum K. Presl
(99); in pollen embryo culture of horse nettle (Solanum carolinense L.) (100); in discs of apple peel
(101);  in  winter  wheat  and  beans  (102);  in  kiwifruit  (Actinidia  chinensis Planch)  (103);  and  in
wheat seedlings under water stress (104). Cobalt also inhibits ethylene production and increases the
apparent  rate  of  synthesis  of  peroxides  and  prevents  the  peroxidative  destruction  of  IAA.  Other
eﬀects include counteraction of the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by dinitrophenol (4).
Cobalt acts mainly through arresting the conversion of methionine to ethylene (105) and thus
inhibits ethylene-induced physiological processes. It also causes prevention of cotyledonary prick-
ling-induced inhibition of hypocotyls in beggar tick (Bidens pilosa L.) (106), promotion of hypocotyl
elongation (107), opening of the hypocotyl hook (bean seedlings) either in darkness or in red light,
and the petiolar hook (Dentaria diphylla Michx.) (108,109). Cobalt has also been noted to cause
reduction of RNAase activity in the storage tissues of potato (110), repression of developmental dis-
tortion such as leaf malformation and accumulation of low-molecular-weight polypeptides in velvet
plant  (Gynura  aurantiaca DC)  (111), delayed  gravitropic  response  in  cocklebur  (Xanthium spp.),
tomato and castor bean stems (112), and prevention of 3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid-induced chloro-
phyll degradation in tobacco leaves (73). Prevention of auxin-induced stomatal opening in detached
leaf epidermis has been observed (85). The eﬀects of ethylene on the kinetics of curvature and auxin
redistribution in the gravistimulated roots of maize are known (113). 60Co γ-rays and EMS inﬂuence
antioxidase activity and ODAP content of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) (114).

17.8.7 NITROGEN FIXATION
Cobalt is essential for nitrogen-ﬁxing microorganisms, including the cyanobacteria. Its importance in
nitrogen ﬁxation by symbiosis in Leguminosae (Fabaceae) has been established (115–119). For exam-
ple, soybeans  grown  with  only  atmospheric  nitrogen  and  no  mineral  nitrogen  have  rapid  nitrogen
ﬁxation and growth with 1.0 or 0.1 µg Co ml⫺1, but have minimal growth without cobalt additions
(4).

17.9 COBALT TOLERANCE BY PLANTS

17.9.1 ALGAE
Stonewort (Chara vulgaris L.) resistant to metal pollution, when cultivated in a natural medium
containing CoCl2 showed high level of cobalt in dry matter as insoluble compounds (120). On the

other hand, a copper-tolerant population of a marine brown alga (Ectocarpus siliculosus Lyng.) had
an increased tolerance to cobalt. The copper-tolerance mechanism of other physiological processes
may be the basis of this cotolerance (121).

17.9.2 FUNGI
A genetically stable cobalt-resistant strain, CoR, of Neurospora crassa Shear & Dodge, exhibited an
approximately  ten-fold  higher  resistance  to  Co2⫹ than  the  parent  strain.  The  Co2⫹ toxicity  was
reversed  by  Mg2⫹, but  not  by  Fe3⫹, indicating  that  the  Co2⫹did  not  aﬀect  iron  metabolism.
Alternatively, the  mechanism  of  resistance  probably  involves  an  alteration  in  the  pattern  of  iron
metabolism so that the toxic concentration of cobalt could not aﬀect the process (122). Magnesium
(Mg2⫹) may reverse the toxicity of Co2⫹, either by increasing the tolerance to high intracellular con-
centration of heavy metal ions or by controlling the process of uptake and accumulation of ions
(123). In several mutants of Aspergillus niger growing in toxic concentrations of Zn2⫹, Co2⫹, Ba2⫹,
Ni 2⫹, Fe3⫹, Sn2⫹, and Mn2⫹, the resistance is due to an intracellular detoxiﬁcation rather than defec-
tive transport. Each mutation was due to a single gene located in its corresponding linkage group.
Toxicity of metals is reversed in the wild-type strain by deﬁnite amounts of K⫹, NH4
⫹, Mg2⫹, and
Ca2⫹. These competitions between pairs of cations indicate a general system responsible for the
transport of cations (124). In Aspergillus fumigatus, cobalt increased thermophily at 45⬚C and fun-
gal tolerance at 55⬚C (125).

17.9.3 HIGHER PLANTS
In higher plants, cobalt tolerance has been mainly reported in members of ‘advanced’ families such
as  the  Labiatae  and  Scrophulariaceae  growing  in  the  copper-ﬁeld  belt  of  Shaba  (Zaire)  (126).
Among these plants, Haumaniastrum robertii, a copper-tolerant species, is also a cobalt-accumu-
lating plant. The plant contains abnormally high cobalt (about 4304 µg g⫺1 dry weight), far exceed-
ing  the  concentration  of  copper. This  species  has  the  highest  cobalt  content  of  any  phanerogam
(127). Haumaniastrum katangense and H. robertii grow on substrates containing 0 to 10,000 µg Co
g⫺1. Although they can accumulate high concentrations of cobalt, an exclusion mechanism operates
in these species at lower concentrations of the element in the soil. Uptake of cobalt was not linked
to a physiological requirement of the element. The plant–soil relationship for Co was signiﬁcantly
high enough for these species to be useful in the biogeochemical prospecting for cobalt (128).

Tolerance and accumulation of copper and cobalt were investigated in three members of phy-
logenetic series of taxa within the genus Silene (Caryophyllaceae) from Zaire, which were regarded
as representing a progression of increasing adaptation to metalliferous soils. Eﬀects of both metals
(singly and in combination) on seed germination, seedling and plant performances, yield, and metal
uptake from soil culture conﬁrmed the ecotypic status of S. burchelli, which is a more tolerant vari-
ant of the nontolerant S. burchelli var. angustifolia. But both the ecotype and metallophyte variants
of S. cobalticola are relatively more tolerant to copper than to cobalt.

18.1 THE ELEMENT SELENIUM

18.1.1 INTRODUCTION
Selenium (Se), a beneﬁcial element, is one of the most widely distributed elements on Earth, having
an average soil abundance of 0.09 mg kg⫺1 (1). It is classiﬁed as a Group VI A metalloid, having

metallic and nonmetallic properties. Selenium was identiﬁed in 1818 by the Swedish chemist Jöns
Jacob Berzelius as an elemental residue during the oxidation of sulfur dioxide from copper pyrites
in the production of sulfuric acid (2). The name selenium originates through its chemical similarities
to tellurium (Te), discovered 35 years earlier. Tellurium had been named after the Earth (tellus in
Latin), so selenium was named for the moon (selene in Greek) (3). Although selenium is not con-
sidered as an essential plant micronutrient (4), it is essential for maintaining mammalian health (5).
Selenium deﬁciency or toxicity in humans and livestock is rare, but can occur in localized areas (5,6)
owing to low selenium contents in soils and locally produced crops (7). Recently, much attention has
been given to the role of selenium in reducing certain types of cancers and diseases. Eﬀorts in plant
improvement have begun to enhance the selenium content of dietary food sources.

18.1.2 SELENIUM CHEMISTRY
Selenium has an atomic number of 34 and an atomic mass of 78.96. The atomic radius of Se is 1.40 Å,
the covalent radius is 1.16 Å, and the ionic radius is 1.98 Å. The ionization potential is 9.74 eV, the
electron aﬃnity is – 4.21 eV, and the electronegativity is 2.55 on the Pauling Scale (8). The chemi-
cal and physical properties of selenium are very similar to those of sulfur (S). Both have similar
atomic size, outer valence-shell electronic conﬁgurations, bond energies, ionization potentials, elec-
tron aﬃnities, electronegativities, and polarizabilities (8). Selenium can exist as elemental selenium
(Se0), selenide (Se2⫺), selenite (SeO3
2⫺). There are six stable isotopes of sele-
nium in nature: 74Se (0.87%), 76Se (9.02%), 77Se (7.58%), 78Se (23.52%), 80Se (49.82%), and  82Se
(9.19%) (8). Some of the commercially available forms of selenium are H2Se, metallic selenides,
SeO2, H2SeO3, SeF4, SeCl2, selenic  acid  (H2SeO4), Na2SeO3, Na2SeO4, and  various  organic  Se
compounds (9).

2⫺), and selenate (SeO4

In the elemental form, selenium exists in either an amorphous state or in one of three crystalline
states. The amorphous form of selenium is a hard, brittle glass at 31⬚C, vitreous at 31 to 230⬚C, and
liquid at temperatures above 230⬚C (10). The ﬁrst of three crystalline states takes the form of ﬂat
hexagonal and polygonal crystals called α-monoclinic or red selenium. The second form is the pris-
matic or needle-like crystal called β-monoclinic or dark-red selenium. The third crystalline state is
made  up  of  spiral  polyatomic  chains  of  Sen, often  referred  to  as  hexagonal  or  black  selenium. 
The black forms of crystalline Se are the most stable. At temperatures above 110⬚C, the monoclinic
amorphous forms convert into this stable black form. Conversion of the amorphous form into the
black form occurs readily at temperatures of 70 to 210⬚C. When Se0 is heated above 400⬚C in air,
it becomes the very pungent and highly toxic gas H2Se. This gas decomposes in air back to Se0 and
water (10).

2⫺), or  the  ⫹6-oxidation  state  (SeO4

Reduction or oxidation of elemental selenium can be to the  ⫺2-oxidation state (Se2⫺), the
⫹4-oxidation  state  (SeO3
2⫺).  The  Se2⫺ ion  is  water-soluble
(270 ml per 100 ml H2O at 22.5⬚C) and will react with most metals to form sparingly soluble metal
selenides. Selenium in the  ⫹4-oxidation state can occur as selenium dioxide (SeO2), SeO3
2⫺, or
selenious acid (H2SeO3). Selenium dioxide is water-soluble (38.4 g per 100 ml H2O at 14⬚C) and is
produced when Se0 is burned or reacts with nitric acid. Reduction back to Se0 can be carried out in
the presence of ammonium, hydroxylamine, or sulfur dioxide. In hot water, SeO2 will dissolve to
H2SeO3, which is weakly dibasic. Organic selenides, which are electron donors, will oxidize read-

In the  ⫹6-oxidation state, selenium is in the form of selenic acid (H2SeO4) or SeO4

2⫺ salts.
Selenic acid is formed by the oxidation of H2SeO3 and is a strong, highly soluble acid. Selenate salts
2⫺ salts and metal Se2⫺ salts are sparingly soluble. Their solubilities and

18.2 SELENIUM IN PLANTS

18.2.1 INTRODUCTION
The question of whether or not selenium is a micronutrient for plants is still considered unresolved (3).
Selenium has not been classiﬁed as an essential element for plants, but its role as a beneﬁcial ele-
ment in plants that are able to accumulate large amounts of it has been considered (11). Uptake and
accumulation of selenium by plants is determined by the form and concentration of selenium, the
presence and identity of competing ions, and aﬃnity of a plant species to absorb and metabolize
selenium (10). Variation in selenium contents of plants seems to exceed that of nearly every other
element (12). Nonconcentrator or nonaccumulator plant species will accumulate ⬎25 mg Se kg⫺1
dry weight. Most crops species such as grains, grasses, fruits, vegetables, and many weed species
are considered nonconcentrators (8,13). Secondary absorbers normally grow in areas with low to
medium soil-selenium concentrations and can accumulate from 25 to 100 mg Se kg⫺1 dry weight.
They  belong  to  a  number  of  diﬀerent  genera, including  Aster, Atriplex, Castelleja, Grindelia,
Gutierrezia, Machaeranthera, and Mentzelia. The primary indicator or selenium-accumulator species
can  accumulate  from  100  to  10,000 mg  Se  kg⫺1 dry  weight.  This  group  includes  species  of
Astragalus, Machaeranthera, Haplopappus, and Stanleya (14). These plant species are suspects for
causing acute selenosis, or selenium toxicity, of range animals that consume the plants as forages
(10,15). Selenium-accumulator plants can contain 100 times more selenium than nonaccumulator
plants when grown on the same soil (16). Surveys of selenium concentrations in crops reveal that
areas  producing  low-selenium  crops  (⬍0.1 mg  Se  kg⫺1)  are  more  common  than  those  producing
crops with toxic selenium levels (⬎2 mg Se kg⫺1) (16).

increase (up to 200 µM) in phosphate solution culture decreased the selenium content of ryegrass
(Lolium perenne L.) shoots and roots by 30 to 50% if selenium was supplied as SeO3. In contrast,

was diﬀerent (33). In contrast, time-dependent kinetic studies showed that Indian mustard absorbed

Increasing levels of selenium in plants may act to suppress the tissue concentrations of nitro-
gen, phosphorus, and sulfur. It can also inhibit the absorption of several heavy metals, especially
manganese, zinc, copper, iron, and  cadmium  (35). This  detoxifying  eﬀect  of  selenium  has  been
demonstrated as reducing cadmium eﬀects on garlic (Allium sativum L.) cell division (36). In con-
trast, the application of nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur is known to detoxify selenium. This eﬀect
may be due to either lowering of selenium uptake by the roots or to establishment of a safe ratio of
selenium to other nutrient elements (35).

2⫺ than with SeO3

Selenomethionine  was  readily  taken  up  by  wheat  (Triticum  aestivum L.)  seedlings, and  the
uptake followed a linear pattern in response to increasing selenium solution concentrations up to
1.0 µM (37). Western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii Löve) also showed linear selenium uptake
with Se-Met solution concentrations up to 0.6 mg Se L⫺1 (38). Results from Bañuelos et al. (39)
showed that alfalfa accumulated selenium in plant tissues when selenium-laden mustard plant tis-
sue was added to the soil. These studies provide evidence that organic selenium compounds in the
soils may become available sources of selenium (40).

Genetic  diﬀerences  for  selenium  uptake  and  accumulation  within  species  have  also  been
reported. In 1939, Trelease and Trelease reported that cream milkvetch (cream locoweed, Astragalus
racemosus Pursh.), a selenium-accumulator, produced 3.81 g dry weight in solution culture with
9 mg Na2SeO3 L⫺1, whereas ground plum (A. crassicarpus Nutt.), a nonaccumulator, produced
only 0.20 g dry weight (41). Shoots of diﬀerent land races of Indian mustard grown hydroponi-
cally in the presence of 2.0 mg Na2SeO4 L⫺1 ranged from 501 to 1092 mg Se kg⫺1 dry matter,
whereas shoots grown in soil culture at 2.0 mg Na2SeO4 kg⫺1 concentration ranged from 407 to
769 mg Se kg⫺1 dry matter (42). Total accumulation of selenium in onion bulb tissue ranged from
60 to 113 µg Se g⫺1 dry weight among 16 diﬀerent cultivars responding to 2.0 mg Na2SeO4 L⫺1
nutrient solution (43).

verted into Se-Met via selenocystathionine and selenohomocysteine (40). Ng and Anderson (50)

plants utilize Se2⫺ as an alternative substrate to S2⫺ to form Se-Cys in lieu of cysteine and that the
aﬃnity for Se2⫺ was substantially greater than for S2⫺.

18.2.4 VOLATILIZATION
Biological methylation of selenium to produce volatile compounds occurs in plants, animals, fungi,
bacteria, and  microorganisms  (9). The  predominant  volatile  selenium  species  is  dimethylselenide,
which is less toxic (1/500 to 1/700) than the inorganic selenium species (51). Plant species diﬀer in
their rates of selenium volatilization, and these rates are correlated with tissue selenium concentra-
tions (52). The ability of plants to accumulate selenium is a good indicator of their potential volatiliza-
tion rate. It was reported that selenium was more readily transported to the shoots of an accumulator
plant (Astragalus bisulcatus A. Gray), whereas a barrier to selenium movement to the shoots was seen
in the nonaccumulator plant, western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii A. Löve) (38). However, in
broccoli, the roots were shown to be the primary site for selenium volatilization (53). In an earlier
experiment with broccoli, Zayed and Terry (54) revealed that a decrease in selenium volatilization
was observed with increased application of SO4

2⫺ fertilizer.

2⫺ was  1.5-fold  that  from  SeO4

Volatilization of selenium is also inﬂuenced by the chemical form of selenium in the growing
medium. The rate of selenium volatilization of a hybrid poplar (Populus tremula ⫻ alba) was 230-
fold higher in sand culture if 20 µM Se was supplied as Se-Met than as SeO3
2⫺, and volatilization

Indian mustard, sugarbeet, or rice supplied with Se-Met was also many folds higher than that from
2⫺ (22). In Indian mustard, Se-volatilization rates were doubled or tripled
plants supplied with SeO3

indicate that selenium volatilization from SeO4

2⫺ is limited by the rate of SeO4

18.2.5 PHYTOREMEDIATION
An increasing problem with irrigation agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions is the appearance of
selenium in soils, ground water, and drainage eﬄuents (12,55,56). The greatest concerns for sele-
nium contamination come in areas where water systems drain seleniferous soils. One area of the
United States that has come under close investigation because of elevated levels of selenium in the
water is the San Joaquin Valley in California (57,58). Selenium enters the groundwater as soluble
selenites and selenates and as suspended particles of sparingly soluble and organic forms of the ele-
ment (8). The mobility of selenium in groundwater is related to its speciation in the aqueous solu-
tion, sorption  properties  of  the  substrate, and  solubility  of  the  solid  phases  (59).  The  ability  of
certain plants to take up, accumulate, and volatilize selenium has an important application in phy-
toremediation of selenium from the environment (3). Phytoremediation of selenium from contami-
nated soils is more practical and economical than its physical removal (60). Bioaccumulation of
selenium  in  wetland  habitats  is  also  a  problem  and  results  in  selenium  toxicity  to  wildlife  (61).
There is a danger of selenium re-entering the local ecosystem if plant tissues that have accumulated
selenium are consumed by wildlife or allowed to degrade (62).

The search for germplasm with the potential for eﬀective phytoremediation has begun (63). The
most ideal plant species for selenium phytoremediation should have the ability for rapid establish-
ment and growth, ability to accumulate or volatilize large amounts of selenium, tolerate salinity and
elevated soil boron, and develop large amounts of biomass on high-selenium soils (3,62–64). Indian
mustard  was  more  eﬃcient  at  accumulating  selenium  than  milkvetch  (Astragalus  incanus L.),
Australian saltbush (Atriplex semibaccata R. Br.), old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia Lindl.),
or tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) when grown in potting soil amended with 3.5 mg Se6⫹
kg⫺1 or 3.5 mg Se4⫹ kg⫺1 as selenate or selenite (60).

Two  of  the  options  available  once  selenium  is  phytoextracted  from  contaminated  soils  are
volatilization of methylated Se forms or harvest and removal of selenium-enriched plant biomass.

Selenium

521

Plant species with a high aﬃnity for phytovolatilization could remove selenium from the environ-
ment by releasing it into the atmosphere, where it is dispersed and diluted by air currents (3,11,62).
Most of the selenium in the air comes from windblown dusts, volcanic activity, and discharges from
human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, smelting and reﬁning of nonferrous metals,
and the manufacturing of glass and ceramics (8). The large particulate and aerosol forms of selenium
generally are not readily available for intake by plants or animals. When 15 crop species were grown
2⫺, rice, broccoli, or cabbage volatized 200 to 350 µg Se m⫺2 leaf
in solution culture with 20 µM SeO4
area day⫺1, whereas sugar beet, bean, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), or onion volatized less than 15 µg
Se m⫺2 leaf area day⫺1 (52). One of the proposed disposal schemes for selenized plants from phy-
toremediation is as a source of forage for selenium-deﬁcient livestock (3,60) Accurate determination
of selenium levels as well as other trace elements in plant tissues and the use of other forages in a
blended mixture would be needed to ensure proper dietary selenium levels in animal feeds (60,62).

18.3 SELENIUM TOXICITY TO PLANTS
Selenium toxicity is inﬂuenced by plant type, form of selenium in the growth medium, and pres-
ence of competing ions such as sulfate and phosphate (9). Interestingly, there are no written reports
of selenium toxicity under cultivated conditions (9,12). This result may be because most crop plants
show no injury or yield suppression until they accumulate at least 300 mg Se kg⫺1, which is usually
more than they contain even on seleniferous soils (9,14). In nonaccumulator plants, the threshold
selenium  concentration  in  shoot  tissue  that  resulted  in  a  10%  restriction  in  yield  ranged  from 
2 mg  Se  kg⫺1 in  rice  to  330 mg  Se  kg⫺1 in  white  clover  (Trifolium  repens L.)  (10).  Wild-plant
species growing in areas of elevated soil selenium tend to be adapted to those regions. Indicator
plants can hyperaccumulate selenium to levels above 10,000 mg Se kg⫺1, but possess biochemical
means to avoid toxicity.

Descriptions for toxicity symptoms come only from solution-culture experiments. Stunting of
growth, slight chlorosis, decreases in protein synthesis and dry matter production, and withering and
drying of leaves are most often associated with selenium toxicity (4). Toxicity of selenium appears
as chlorotic spots on older leaves that also exhibit bleaching symptoms. A pinkish, translucent color
appearing  on  roots  can  also  occur  (65).  Onions  grown  under  extremely  toxic  Se  concentrations
showed sulfur-deﬁciency symptoms just before plant death (D.A. Kopsell and W.M. Randle, unpub-
lished data, 1994).

The toxic eﬀect of selenium to plants results mainly from interferences of selenium with sulfur
metabolism (10). In most plant species, selenoamino acids replace the corresponding S-amino acids
and are incorporated into proteins. Nuehierl and Böck (66) reported on a proposed mechanism of sele-
nium tolerance in plants. In nonaccumulator plant species, Se-cys would either be incorporated into
proteins or function as a substrate for downstream-sulfur pathways, which would allow selenium to
interfere with sulfur metabolism. Replacing cysteine (Cys) with Se-Cys in S-proteins will alter the ter-
tiary structure and negatively aﬀect their catalytic activity (31). In contrast, accumulator plant species
would instantly and speciﬁcally methylate Se-cys using Se-Cys methyltransferase, thereby avoiding
Se-induced phytotoxicity (31). This action would remove selenium from the pool of substrates for cys-
teine metabolism. Thus, Se-Cys methyltransferase may be a critical enzyme conferring selenium tol-
erance  in  selenium-accumulating  plants. Alternatively, tolerance  may  be  achieved  by  sequestering
selenium as selenate or other nonprotein Se-amino acids in the vacuole in accumulator plant cells (3).

18.4 SELENIUM IN THE SOIL

18.4.1 INTRODUCTION
2⫺ (8). Soils
The two forms of selenium that predominate in cultivated soils are SeO4
also  contain  organic  selenium  compounds  such  as  Se-Met  (67).  Selenium  occurs  in  the  highest 
concentration  in  the  surface  layers  of  soils, where  there  is  an  abundance  of  organic  matter  (9).

Selenium in soils is generally considered to be controlled by an adsorption mechanism rather than
by precipitation–dissolution reactions (68). In acid soils, sesquioxides control the sorption of sele-

nium. Absorption controls the co-precipitation of SeO3
absorbed by soil solids. Adsorption is also believed to control the distribution of selenium in the soil
under oxidizing conditions (68).

Transformation of SeO3

SeO3
2⫺. But, after the initial oxidation, the remaining selenium in the soil becomes inert, and any
SeO3
further oxidation proceeds very slowly. The rate of oxidation will vary in diﬀerent soil types (68).

18.4.2 GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION
Selenium attracts interest because the amount in which it is present in soils is not evenly distributed
geographically.  Seleniferous  soils  and  vegetation  in  North  America  extend  from  Alberta,
Saskatchewan, and Manitoba south along the west coast into Mexico (12). The mean total selenium
in soils of the United States is reported to be 0.26 mg kg⫺1 (69). Considerable variability exists from
one location to another, and high Se concentrations occur in a few localized regions. In the United
States, seleniferous soils occur in the northern Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado and in the Southwest states of Utah, Arizona,
and New Mexico. These soils average 4 to 5 mg Se kg⫺1 and can reach levels as high as 80 mg kg⫺1
in some areas (8). The primary selenium sources are the western shales of the Cretaceous Age and
the carbonic debris of sandstone ores of the Colorado Plateau (9).

In the other parts of the world, selenium occurs in high amounts only in the semi-arid and arid
regions derived from cretaceous soils (14). Seleniferous soils occur in Mexico, Columbia, Hawaii,
and China. Toxic soil selenium levels (⬎300 mg kg⫺1) in Europe are limited to a few locations in
Wales and Ireland (16). High-selenium soils also occur in Iceland, probably because of the volcanic
activity on the island (16). In contrast, soils in Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia,
and New Zealand, and Finland are naturally low in selenium (16). In humid climates, or in irrigated
areas, most of the selenium is leached from soils (9). The most severe selenium-deﬁcient area in the
world is the Keshan region in southeastern China (16), where many children have died owing to
insuﬃcient dietary selenium. Variations in soil selenium can give rise to diﬀerences of selenium in
the food chain (70).

Selenium can enter the soil through weathering of selenium-containing rocks, volcanic activity,
phosphate fertilizers, and water movement. The selenium content in the soil reﬂects the concentra-
tion in the parent material, secondary deposition or redistribution of selenium in the soil proﬁle,
accumulation  and  deposition  by  selenium-accumulating  plant  materials, and  erosion  from  sele-
nium-containing rocks (71). The highest amounts of selenium are in igneous rock formations, exist-
ing as Se2⫺ or sulfoselenides with copper, silver, lead, mercury, and nickel (8). Selenium also occurs
under sedimentary rock formations. The weathering of selenium-containing rocks under alkaline
2⫺ form.
and well-aerated conditions releases selenium into the soil, which oxidizes it into the SeO4
Selenium released from rocks under acidic, poorly aerated conditions will form insoluble Se2⫺ and
2⫺. These forms of selenium develop stable adsorption complexes with ferric hydroxide and
SeO3
are less available to plants (8). The level of selenium in a phosphate fertilizer is governed by the
concentration  of  selenium  in  the  phosphatic  rock  (9).  Fifteen  diﬀerent  rock-phosphate  fertilizers
from  sources  in  Canada  and  the  United  States  ranged  in  selenium  concentration  from  0.07  to
178 mg kg⫺1 (72). Ordinary and concentrated super phosphate can be expected to contain between
40 and 60% more selenium than the phosphate rock from which it was made (72).

The distribution of selenium in the soil proﬁle is determined by factors such as soil type, amount
of organic matter, soil pH, and to some extent, leaching caused by rainfall. Organic matter helps to
retain selenium in the surface horizon and has a greater SeO3-ﬁxation capacity than clay minerals
do (9,16). Soil pH, aeration, water levels, and oxidation–reduction conditions have an eﬀect on the

CRC_DK2972_Ch018.qxd  7/14/2006  11:59 AM  Page 523

form of selenium in the soil and its availability to plants. Selenates are highly soluble in water and
do not have stable adsorption complexes, thereby making them highly leachable (8).

Metal selenides occur in metal sulﬁde ores of iron, copper, and lead. Selenium occurs in small
quantities in pyrite and in the minerals clausthalite (PbSe), naumannite ((Ag,Pb)Se), and tiemannite
(HgSe). The similarity of the ionic radii of Se2⫺ (0.191 nm) and S2⫺ (0.184 nm) results in substitution
of Se2⫺ for S2⫺. Soil pH will aﬀect the capacity of clays and ferric oxides to adsorb selenium (10).
Selenite  has  a  strong  aﬃnity  for  sorption, especially  by  iron  oxides  like  geothite, amorphous  iron
2⫺ is also a function of soil-particle con-
hydroxide, and aluminum sesquioxides. Adsorption of SeO3

phosphate (10). Being stable in reducing environments, Se0 can be oxidized to SeO3
amounts of SeO4

2⫺ by some microorganisms.

18.4.3 SELENIUM AVAILABILITY IN SOILS
Soil texture can aﬀect selenium availability and uptake by plants. Because of the adsorption of
2⫺ to clay fractions in the soil, plants grown on sandy soils take up twice as much selenium
SeO3
as those grown on loamy soils (10). Organic matter has the ability to draw selenium from the soil
solution (10). In general, selenium concentrations in plants will increase as the level of soil sele-
2⫺ (10). Extraction of selenium from
nium increases, but will decrease with the addition of SO4
2⫺ is used in the leaching process (9). The presence of low-molecu-
soils is increased when SO4
2⫺ sorption sites on
lar-weight organic acids in the soil–root interface resulted in the loss of SeO3
aluminum hydroxides (73). A decrease in total selenium accumulation from soils supplied with
sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) resulted under conditions of increasing levels of sodium (NaCl) and
calcium (CaCl) salinity for canola (Brassica napus L.), kenaf (Hibiscus cannibinus L.), and tall
fescue (74).

The chemical form of selenium in the soil is determined mainly by soil pH and redox potential
2⫺ form. When  soil  conditions

become neutral to acidic, sparingly soluble ferric oxide–selenite complexes develop. Since spar-
ingly soluble forms dominate at low pH, liming of the soil to raise the pH also has an eﬀect by
increasing  the  availability  of  selenium  to  plants  (9). This  response  to  addition  of  lime  is  probably

Selenium can be supplied to plants by application to soil, by foliar sprays, and by seed treat-
ments  (16).  Slow-release  selenium  fertilizers  were  eﬀective  over  a  4-year  period  in  maintaining
selenium levels in subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) to prevent selenium deﬁciency
in sheep in Australia (77). Use of selenium-enriched Ca(NO3)2 signiﬁcantly increased selenium in
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (78). Coal ﬂy ash has been used as a source of soil-applied selenium
as well as many heavy metals (9). One should be careful when using phosphate fertilizers as soil
amendments, since they may contain substantial amounts of selenium (10). Selenium incorporation
2⫺
into fertilizers is becoming common in some countries with low soil-Se levels. Spraying SeO4
onto pumice has been used for the production of selenium prills in New Zealand (16,77).

18.5 SELENIUM IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL NUTRITION

18.5.1 INTRODUCTION
After its discovery, selenium was most noted for its harmful eﬀects. Selenium was the ﬁrst element
identiﬁed to occur in native vegetation at levels toxic to animals. Poisoning of animals can occur
through  consumption  of  plants  containing  toxic  levels  of  selenium  (79).  Livestock  consuming
excessive  amounts  of  selenized  forages  are  aﬄicted  with  ‘alkali  disease’ and  ‘blind  staggers.’
Typical symptoms of these diseases include loss of hair, deformed hooves, blindness, colic, diar-
rhea, lethargy, increased heart and respiration rates, and eventually death. On the other hand, sele-
nium  deﬁciency  in  animal  feeds  can  cause  ‘white  muscle  disease,’ a  degenerative  disease  of  the
cardiac and skeletal muscles (9). Perceptions of selenium changed when Schwarz and Foltz (80)
reported that additions of selenium prevented liver necrosis in rats (Rattus spp.) deﬁcient in vitamin
E. Its role in human health was established in 1973 when selenium, the last of 40 nutrients proven
to be essential, was shown to be a component of glutathione peroxidase (GSHx), an enzyme that
protects against oxidative cell damage (81). The United States’ recommended daily allowance for
selenium is 50 to 70 µg in human diets (5). Currently, all of the known functions of selenium as an
essential nutrient in humans and other animals have been associated with selenoproteins (82).

18.5.2 DIETARY FORMS
Organic  forms  of  selenium  appear  to  be  more  bioavailable  than  the  inorganic  ones  because  the
organic  forms  are  more  easily  absorbed, have  the  ability  to  be  stored  in  seleno-  and  other
nonspeciﬁc  proteins, and  have  lower  renal  clearance  (83).  The  organic-selenium  compounds
identiﬁed  in  plants  include  Se-Cys, Se-methylselenocysteine, selenohomocystine, Se-Met, Se-
methyl-selenomethionine, selenomethionine  selenoxide, selenocystathionine, and  di-methyl  dise-
lenide, selenoethionine, and  Se-allyl  selenocysteine  (41,84,85).  The  majority  of  selenium  in
seleniferous wheat was shown to be Se-Met (86). The eﬀect of consumption of seleniferous wheat
on urinary excretion and retention in the body was similar to that of Se-Met supplementation (87).
The form of selenium in nuts is selenocystathionine (88). The high-selenium-accumulating species
of milkvetch (Astragalus spp. L.) contain Se-methylselenocysteine and selenocystathionine (89).
Most  fruits  and  vegetables  contain  ⬎0.1 mg  Se  kg⫺1, (13)  but  some  have  the  potential  to  be
enriched. Marine ﬁsh such as tuna are high in selenium, but bioactivity is much lower than selenium
2⫺, and Se2⫺ have been identiﬁed in plants at low lev-
from other foods (90). Inorganic SeO3
2⫺ are not regarded as naturally occurring forms of selenium in foods,
els (91). Selenate and SeO3
but they have high biological activity, and animals can metabolize them into more active forms such

as Se-Cys (90). Selenocysteine is a component of glutathione peroxidase and constitutes the major-
ity of selenium in animal proteins.

18.5.3 METABOLISM AND FORM OF SELENIUM
The bioavailability and metabolism of selenium and its distribution in an organism depend on the
form of selenium ingested (83). The chemical form of selenium in foods and supplements deter-
mines absorption, speciation, and metabolism within the body, bioavailability for selenoproteins,
and toxicity (87). Inorganic forms of selenium are absorbed rapidly, but are equally rapidly excreted
in the urine, in contrast to Se-Met, which is retained in the body. Total recovery of inorganic forms
of selenium in urine and feces of human subjects was 82 to 95% of the total dose, whereas only
26% of the total Se-Met was recovered after being ingested (87). Prolonged consumption of any one
single form of selenium can produce side eﬀects such as exaggerated accumulation in body tissues
(Se-Met) and changes in cellular glutathione homeostasis (selenite) (92). When high levels of inor-
2⫺ or organic Se-Met were fed to rats, higher selenium concentrations in body tissues
ganic SeO3
2⫺. Selenium levels in erythrocytes, testes, kidney, and lungs
were found for Se-Met than for SeO3
were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between rats fed with 0.2 mg kg⫺1 Se as SeO3
2⫺ and those fed with
Se as Se-Met, but higher levels of selenium were found in liver, muscle, and brain tissues for rats
fed with Se-Met (93). There was an increase of up to 26-fold in the concentration of selenium local-
ized in muscle tissues for rats fed with high levels of selenium as Se-Met when compared with those
2⫺. Selenium from Se-Met and seleno yeast showed higher accumulation in liver and
fed with SeO3
muscle tissues than that from SeO3

2⫺ for channel catﬁsh (94).

18.6 SELENIUM AND HUMAN HEALTH

18.6.1 INTRODUCTION
Immune  system  enhancement, cancer  suppression, and  cardiovascular  disease  reduction  are  all
associated with increased dietary selenium (95–97). The chief biological function of selenium is as
an  essential  cofactor  to  the  enzyme  GSHx  (81). The  antioxidant  enzyme  GSHx  protects  against
oxidative  stress  by  removing  DNA-damaging  hydrogen  peroxide  and  lipid  hydroperoxides.  The
chemopreventive action of selenium may come from its role in GSHx (98). Other protective quali-
ties attributed to selenium, independent of GSHx activity, include repair of damaged DNA (99),
reduction in DNA binding of carcinogens (100), and suppressing genetic mutations (101).

18.6.2 SELENIUM DEFICIENCY AND TOXICITY IN HUMANS
The average selenium intake by humans in most countries is suﬃcient to meet the United States’
recommended daily allowances, and selenium deﬁciency in healthy humans is relatively rare (5,6).
Selenium  status  in  a  population  correlates  highly  with  the  selenium  content  of  locally  produced
crops  (7).  In  areas  of  the  world  with  low  soil  selenium, addition  of  selenium  in  normal  fertility
regimes  is  practiced  to  avoid  selenium  deﬁciencies  in  humans  and  livestock  (16). A  signiﬁcant
inverse relationship between low-selenium status and increased risk of cancer mortality has been
established for some rural counties of the United States (102).

The  link  between  selenium  deﬁciency  and  disease  is  associated  with  more  than  40  diﬀerent
health conditions (103). The ﬁrst reports of diseases linked to selenium status came from regions of
China  having  extremely  low  soil  selenium.  Keshan  disease, an  endemic  cardiomyopathy, and
Kashin-Beck disease, a chronic and deforming arthritis, have been linked to selenium deﬁciency
(104). Selenium deﬁciency also depresses the eﬀectiveness of immune cells. Selenium deﬁciency
was  found  to  be  an  independent  predictor  of  survival  rates  among  patients  infected  with  HIV
(human immunodeﬁciency virus) (105). Increasing selenium intake in animals and human beings

CRC_DK2972_Ch018.qxd  7/14/2006  11:59 AM  Page 526

526

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

increases antitumorigenic activities (106), and selenium-dietary supplementation decreases severity
of several viral diseases (107).

The United States National Academy of Sciences has identiﬁed selenium intake of up to 200 µg
day⫺1 as safe (108). However, sustained consumption of selenium levels exceeding 750 µg day⫺1
can cause selenium poisoning or selenosis (109). Signs of human selenosis include morphological
changes in ﬁngernails and hair loss, with an accompanied garlicky breath odor. Human selenosis
reports  have  come  from  regions  in  China, where  extremely  high  levels  of  soil  selenium  caused
human-dietary intake to be ⬎900 µg day⫺1 (110).

18.6.3 ANTICARCINOGENIC EFFECTS OF SELENIUM
There is perhaps no more extensive body of evidence for the cancer preventive potential of a nor-
mal dietary component than there is for selenium (106). Evidence for inverse associations between
nutritional selenium status and cancer risk exist from epidemiological studies (111,112), experi-
mental  animal  models  (92,113), and  most  recently, clinical  trials  (5).  Selenium  supplementation
resulted in a 63% reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer over a 10-year period in an at-risk
group of men given 200 µg Se day⫺1 (5). Experimental antitumorigenic eﬀects of selenium are asso-
ciated with supranutritional levels of at least 10 times those required to prevent clinical signs of
selenium  deﬁciency  (106).  These  levels  are  higher  than  those  experienced  by  most  people, an
amount which tends to be ⬍150 to 200 µg Se day⫺1. Anticarcinogenic activity of selenium may not
involve its usual role as a nutrient because selenium-dependent enzyme activities are already at a
maximum at levels of selenium below eﬀective anticarcinogenic level and the forms of selenium
that  lack  nutritional  activity  (not  synthesized  by  Se-dependent  enzymes)  show  good  cancer-
preventing  activity  (82).  Therefore, for  anticarcinogenic  eﬀects  to  be  seen, supplementation  of
2⫺ and yeast-derived Se-Met are the most
selenium in the diet is usually needed. Inorganic SeO3
common selenium supplements for human consumption.

18.6.4 IMPORTANCE OF SELENIUM METHYLATION IN CHEMOPREVENTIVE ACTIVITY
Methylation is the best-known fate of selenium, and fully methylated metabolites are regarded as
detoxiﬁed forms of selenium. Selenium methylselenocysteine has very high chemopreventive activ-
ity. This form of selenium is naturally occurring in plants enriched with selenium and does not get
incorporated into proteins, thus minimizing excessive accumulation in body tissues. The metabo-
lism of Se-methylselenocysteine produced monomethylated forms of selenium as excretory prod-
ucts (82). The potential activity of selenium can be enhanced in the course of being metabolized in
plants, especially in those having specialized alkyl-group capabilities. Some plants such as alliums
can transfer allyl groups to sulfur, or possibly, selenium. These allyl groups can undergo methyla-
tion to form highly chemopreventive alkylated derivatives (82). Selenium-enriched garlic (Allium
sativum L.) had higher chemopreventive activity than regular garlic alone in animal models (113).
Natural  selenium  products  formed  in  plants  are  very  active  chemopreventive  metabolites.  They
show higher activity in animals than the selenium compounds metabolized from inorganic selenium
sources (82).

18.7 SELENIUM ENRICHMENT OF PLANTS
Substantial genetic variation in plants has been reported for mineral (43,114,115), vitamin (116),
and phytochemical content (117). Breeding plants that are enriched with mineral nutrients and vita-
mins  could  substantially  reduce  the  recurrent  costs  associated  with  fortiﬁcation  (118,119).
Successful programs are now in place for improving zinc (120) and iron (119) contents of wheat.
Selenium  fertilizer  has  been  used  in  Finland  on  vegetable  crops  to  increase  the  uptake  levels  of
dietary Se in both humans and other animals (121). However, there is very little information on the

Selenium

inheritance of Se uptake and accumulation in plants. Investigation into the genetic variation for Se
content in tall fescue revealed that progress from selection for selenium content is possible and that
the trait was heritable (122). Narrow-sense heritability estimates for selenium accumulation in a
rapid-cycling Brassica oleracea L. population were moderate (0.55), and gains from selection were
4.8  and  4.0%  per  selection  cycle  for  high  and  low  selenium  accumulation, respectively  (114).
Knowledge of the genetic variances for selenium accumulation will be useful in selecting eﬃcient
strategies  designed  to  enhance  food  crops.  Further  research  is  needed  to  identify  the  form  and
dosage of selenium delivered by selenium-enriched plants (92).

18.8 SELENIUM TISSUE ANALYSIS VALUES OF VARIOUS PLANT SPECIES
Selenium is unevenly distributed within plant tissues. Actively growing tissues usually contain the
highest  amounts  of  Se  (35), and  many  plant  species  accumulate  higher  amounts  of  selenium  in
shoot or leaf tissues than in root tissues. Plant species diﬀer greatly in their ability to accumulate
seed selenium. Nelson and Johnson (123) reported seed selenium levels up to 3750 µg Se g⫺1 dry
weight  in  native  milkvetch  (Astragalus L.)  species.  Selenium  accumulation  in  a  rapid-cycling
Brassica oleracea L. population increased linearly with increasing Na2SeO4 treatment concentra-
tions in nutrient solution culture, ranging from nondetectable at 0 mg Na2SeO4 L⫺1 to 753 µg Se g⫺1
dry weight at 7.0 mg Na2SeO4 L⫺1 (124). Selenium is also unevenly distributed within seeds. In
dried grains of barley, the husk and pericarp accumulated selenium up to 0.6 µg Se g⫺1, the scutel-
lum 0.4 µg Se g⫺1, the embryo 0.3 µg Se g⫺1, and the aleurone layer, embryonic leaves, and root ini-
tials 0.2 µg Se g⫺1 (125).

Selenium treatment and selenium-enriched media will aﬀect seed germination in a number of
species. Soybeans (Glycine max Merr.) pretreated with 10 to 100 g Se ha⫺1 as either seed or foliar
treatments  were  grown  on  a  nonseleniferous  sandy  loam  soil  and  subsequently  produced  seeds
accumulating 0.78 to 38.5 mg Se kg⫺1. When these seeds were planted without application of sele-
nium fertilizer, the concentration of harvested seeds decreased to 0.11 to 1.02 mg Se kg⫺1 (126).
Seed germination was reduced if wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown in soils with ⬎16.0 mg
Se kg⫺1 (127). Weight of fresh Alfalfa seedling was suppressed in response to ⬎10.0 mg Se L⫺1 in
solution culture (128). Turnip (Brassica campestris L.) seed germination was ⬎98% when seeds
were incubated in ⬍484 mg NaSeO3 L⫺1, but decreased to 51% if the concentration of NaSeO4 was
increased to 4.84 g NaSeO3 L⫺1. In response to NaSeO3, turnip seed germination was 97% at Se lev-
els  ⬍95 mg  NaSeO3 L⫺1, 53%  at  484 mg  NaSeO3 L⫺1, 17%  at  951 mg  NaSeO3 L⫺1, and  0%  at
4.84 g NaSeO3 L⫺1 (129). Interestingly, several studies report that seed germination was enhanced
in response to ⬍1.0 mg Se L⫺1 in nutrient solutions (127,130,131). Activity of β-galactosidase, an
enzyme important in the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates during seed germination, in fenu-
greek  (Trigonella  foenum-graecum L.)  was  enhanced  by  40%  when  exposed  to  0.5 mg  L⫺1
Na2SeO3-seed treatment, but decreased by 60 to 65% if Na2SeO3-seed treatment was increased to
1 mg L⫺1 (132). Seed germination was ⬎96% after 72 h in a rapid-cycling Brassica oleracea pop-

19.1 INTRODUCTION
Silicon  (Si)  is  the  second-most  abundant  element  of  the  Earth’s  surface.  Beginning  in  1840,
numerous laboratory, greenhouse, and ﬁeld experiments have shown beneﬁts of application of sil-
icon fertilizer for rice (Oryza sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley

(Hordeum vulgare L.), and sugar cane (Saccharum oﬃcinarum L.). Silicon fertilizer has a double
eﬀect on the soil–plant system. First, improved plant-silicon nutrition reinforces plant-protective
properties against diseases, insect attack, and unfavorable climatic conditions. Second, soil treat-
ment  with  biogeochemically  active  silicon  substances  optimizes  soil  fertility  through  improved
water, physical  and  chemical  soil  properties, and  maintenance  of  nutrients  in  plant-available
forms.

19.2 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES
In 1819, Sir Humphrey Davy wrote:

The siliceous epidermis of plants serves as support, protects the bark from the action of insects, and
seems to perform a part in the economy of these feeble vegetable tribes (Grasses and Equisetables) sim-
ilar to that performed in the animal kingdom by the shell of crustaceous insects (1)

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many naturalists measured the elemental composition of
plants. Their data demonstrated that plants usually contain silicon in amounts exceeding those of
other elements (2) (Figure 19.1). In 1840, Justius von Leibig suggested using sodium silicate as a
silicon fertilizer and conducted the ﬁrst greenhouse experiments on this subject with sugar beets
(3). Starting in 1856, and being continued at present, a ﬁeld experiment at the Rothamsted Station
(England) has demonstrated a marked eﬀect of sodium silicate on grass productivity (4).

The ﬁrst patents on using silicon slag as a fertilizer were obtained in 1881 by Zippicotte and
Zippicotte (5). The ﬁrst soil test for plant-available silicon was conducted in the Hawaiian Islands
by Professor Maxwell in 1898 (6).

Japanese agricultural scientists appear to have been the most advanced regarding the practical
use of silicon fertilizers, having developed a complete technology for using silicon fertilizers for
rice in the 1950s and 1960s. Other investigations of the eﬀect of silicon on plants were conducted
in France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and in other countries.

19.3 SILICON IN PLANTS

553

19.3.1 PLANT ABSORPTION OF SILICON
Tissue analyses from a wide variety of plants showed that silicon concentrations range from 1 to
100 g Si kg⫺1 of dry weight, depending on plant species (7). Comparison of these values with those
for  elements  such  as  phosphorus, nitrogen, calcium, and  others  shows  silicon  to  be  present  in
amounts equivalent to those of macronutrients (Figure 19.1).

Plants absorb silicon from the soil solution in the form of monosilicic acid, also called orthosili-
cic acid [H4SiO4] (8,9). The largest amounts of silicon are adsorbed by sugarcane (300–700 kg of
Si ha⫺1), rice (150–300 kg of Si ha⫺1), and wheat (50–150 kg of Si ha⫺1) (10). On an average, plants
absorb from 50 to 200 kg of Si ha⫺1. Such values of silicon absorbed cannot be fully explained by
passive absorption (such as diﬀusion or mass ﬂow) because the upper 20 cm soil layer contains only
an average of 0.1 to 1.6 kg Si ha⫺1 as monosilicic acid (11–13). Some results have shown that rice
roots possess speciﬁc ability to concentrate silicon from the external solution (14).

19.3.2 FORMS OF SILICON IN PLANTS
Basically, silicon is absorbed by plants as monosilicic acid or its anion (9). In the plant, silicon is
transported from the root to the shoot by means of the transportation stream in the xylem. Soluble
monosilicic acid may penetrate through cell membranes passively (15). Active transport of mono-
silicic acid in plants has received little study.

After root adsorption, monosilicic acid is translocated rapidly into the leaves of the plant in the
transpiration  stream  (16).  Silicon  is  concentrated  in  the  epidermal  tissue  as  a  ﬁne  layer  of  sili-
con–cellulose membrane and is associated with pectin and calcium ions (17). By this means, the
double-cuticular layer can protect and mechanically strengthen plant structures (18).

With increasing silicon concentration in the plant sap, monosilicic acid is polymerized (8). The
chemical nature of polymerized silicon has been identiﬁed as silicon gel or biogenic opal, amor-
phous SiO2, which is hydrated with various numbers of water molecules (9,19). Monosilicic acid
polymerization is assigned to the type of condensable polymerization with gradual dehydration of
monosilicic acid and then polysilicic acid (20,21):

n(Si(OH)4) → (SiO2) ⫹ 2n(H2O)

Plants  synthesize  silicon-rich  structures  of  nanometric  (molecular), microscopic  (ultrastruc-
tural), and macroscopic (bulk) dimensions (22). Ninety percent of absorbed silicon is transformed
into  various  types  of  phytoliths  or  silicon–cellulose  structures, represented  by  amorphous  silica
(18). Partly biogenic silica is generated as unique cell or inter-cell structures at the nanometer level
(23). The chemical composition of oat (Avena sativa L.) phytoliths (solid particles of SiO2) was
shown to be amorphous silica (82–86%) and varying amounts of sodium, potassium, calcium, and
iron (24). Phytoliths are highly diversiﬁed, and one plant can synthesize several forms (25,26). A
change in plant-silicon nutrition has an inﬂuence on phytolith forms (27).

19.3.3 BIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS WITH SILICON
Soluble silicon compounds, such as monosilicic acid and polysilicic acid, aﬀect many chemical and
physical-chemical  soil  properties.  Monosilicic  acid  possesses  high  chemical  activity  (21,28).
Monosilicic acid can react with aluminum, iron, and manganese with the formation of slightly sol-
uble silicates (29,30):

Monosilicic acid under diﬀerent concentrations is able to combine with heavy metals (Cd, Pb,
Zn, Hg, and others), forming soluble complex compounds if monosilicic acid concentration is less
(31), and slightly soluble heavy metal silicates when the concentration of monosilicic acid is greater
in the system (28,32).

Silicon  may  play  a  prominent  part  in  the  eﬀects  of  aluminum  on  biological  systems  (33).
Signiﬁcant amelioration of aluminum toxicity by silicon has been noted by diﬀerent groups and in
diﬀerent species (34). The main mechanism of the eﬀect of silicon on aluminum toxicity is proba-
bly connected with the formation of nontoxic hydroxyaluminosilicate complexes (35).

The  anion  of  monosilicic  acid  [Si(OH)3]⫺ can  replace  the  phosphate  anion  [HPO4]2⫺ from 
calcium, magnesium, aluminum, and  iron  phosphates  (12).  Silicon  may  replace  phosphate  from
DNA  and  RNA  molecules. As  a  result, proper  silicon  nutrition  is  responsible  for  increasing  the 
stability of DNA and RNA molecules (36–38).

Silicon has also been shown to result in higher concentrations of chlorophyll per unit area of leaf
tissue (39). This action may mean that a plant can tolerate either low or high light levels by using
light more eﬃciently. Moreover, supplemental levels of soluble silicon are responsible for producing
higher  concentrations  of  the  enzyme  ribulose  bisphosphate  carboxylase  in  leaf  tissue  (39).  This
enzyme regulates the metabolism of CO2 and promotes more eﬃcient use of CO2 by plants.

The increase in the content of sugar in sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.) (3,40) and sugar cane
(41,42) as a result of silicon fertilizer application may be assessed as a biochemical inﬂuence of sil-
icon as well. The optimization of silicon nutrition for orange resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in
fruit sugar (brix) (43).

There have been few investigations of the role and functions of polysilicic acid and phytoliths

in higher plants.

In spite of numerous investigations and observed eﬀects of silicon on plants and the consider-
able uptake and accumulation of silicon by plants, no evidence yet shows that silicon takes part
directly in the metabolism of higher plants.

19.4 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF SILICON IN PLANT NUTRITION

19.4.1 EFFECT OF SILICON ON BIOTIC STRESSES
Silicon  has  been  found  to  suppress  many  plant  diseases  (Table  19.1)  and  insect  attacks  (Table
19.2). The eﬀect of silicon on plant resistance to pests is considered to be due either to accumula-
tion of absorbed silicon in the epidermal tissue or expression of pathogensis-induced host-defense
responses. Accumulated monosilicic acid polymerizes into polysilicic acid and then transforms to
amorphous silica, which forms a thickened silicon–cellulose membrane (44,45), and, which can
be associated with pectin and calcium ions (46). By this means, a double-cuticular layer protects
and mechanically strengthens plants (9) (Figure 19.2). Silicon might also form complexes with
organic  compounds  in  the  cell  walls  of  epidermal  cells, therefore  increasing  their  resistance  to
degradation by enzymes released by the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea M.E. Barr) (47).
Indeed, silicon can be associated with lignin–carbohydrate complexes in the cell wall of rice epi-
dermal cells (48).

Research also points to the role of silicon in plants as being active and suggests that the element
might be a signal for inducing defense reactions to plant diseases. Silicon has been demonstrated to
stimulate chitinase activity and rapid activation of peroxidases and polyphenoxidases after fungal
infection (49). Glycosidically bound phenolics extracted from amended plants when subjected to
acid or β-glucosidase hydrolysis displayed strong fungistatic activity. Dann and Muir (50) reported

that pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings amended with potassium silicate showed an increase in the
activity of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase prior to being challenged by the fungal blight caused by
Mycosphaerella pinodes Berk. et Blox. In addition, fewer lesions were observed on leaves from sil-
icon-treated  pea  seedlings  than  on  leaves  from  pea  seedlings  not  amended  with  silicon.  More

recently, ﬂavonoids and momilactone phytoalexins were found to be produced in both dicots and
monocots, respectively, and these antifungal compounds appear to be playing an active role in plant
disease suppression (51,52).

19.4.2 EFFECT OF SILICON ON ABIOTIC STRESSES
Silicon deposits in cell walls of xylem vessels prevent compression of the vessels under conditions
of high transpiration caused by drought or heat stress. The silicon–cellulose membrane in epider-
mal  tissue  also  protects  plants  against  excessive  loss  of  water  by  transpiration  (53). This  action
occurs owing to a reduction in the diameter of stomatal pores (54) and, consequently, a reduction
in leaf transpiration (15).

The  interaction  between  monosilicic  acid  and  heavy  metals, aluminum, and  manganese  in
soil (discussed below) helps clarify the mechanism by which heavy metal toxicity of plants is
reduced (55,56).

Silicon may alleviate salt stress in higher plants (57,58). There are several hypotheses for this
eﬀect.  They  are  (a)  improved  photosynthetic  activity, (b)  enhanced  K/Na  selectivity  ratio, (c)
increased  enzyme  activity, and  (d)  increased  concentration  of  soluble  substances  in  the  xylem,
resulting in limited sodium adsorption by plants (58–61).

Proper silicon nutrition can increase frost resistance by plants (58,62). However, this mecha-

nism remains poorly understood.

19.5 EFFECT OF SILICON ON PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

19.5.1 EFFECT OF SILICON ON ROOT DEVELOPMENT
Optimization of silicon nutrition results in increased mass and volume of roots, giving increased
total  and  adsorbing  surfaces  (39,63–66). As  a  result  of  application  of  silicon  fertilizer, the  dry
weight of barley increased by 21 and 54% over 20 and 30 days of growth, respectively, relative to
plants receiving no supplemental silicon (67). Silicon fertilizer increases root respiration (68).

A  germination  experiment  with  citrus  (Citrus spp.)  has  demonstrated  that  with  increasing
monosilicic acid concentration in irrigation water, the weight of roots increased more than that of
shoots (69). The same eﬀect was observed for bahia grass (Paspalum notatum Flügge) (70).

19.5.2 EFFECT OF SILICON ON FRUIT FORMATION
Silicon plays an important role in hull formation in rice, and, in turn, seems to inﬂuence grain qual-
ity (71). The hulls of poor-quality, milky-white grains (kernels) are generally low in silicon content,
which is directly proportional to the silicon concentration in the rice straw (72).

Barley grains that were harvested from a silicon-fertilized area had better capacity for germi-
nation than seeds from a soil poor in plant-available silicon (37). Poor silicon nutrition had a nega-
tive eﬀect on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) ﬂowering (73). It is important to note that the
application of silicon fertilizer accelerated citrus growth by 30 to 80%, speeded up fruit maturation
by 2 to 4 weeks, and increased fruit quantity (74). A similar acceleration in plant maturation with
silicon fertilizer application was observed for corn (37).

19.5.3 EFFECT OF SILICON ON CROP YIELD
Numerous  ﬁeld experiments under diﬀerent soil and climatic conditions and with various plants
clearly demonstrated the beneﬁts of application of silicon fertilizer for crop productivity and crop
quality (Table 19.3).

Silicon

19.6 SILICON IN SOIL

561

19.6.1 FORMS OF SILICON IN SOIL
Soils generally contain from 50 to 400 g Si kg⫺1 of soil. Soil-silicon compounds usually are pres-
ent as SiO2 and various aluminosilicates. Quartz, together with crystalline forms of silicates (pla-
gioclase, orthoclase, and  feldspars), secondary  or  clay-  and  silicon-rich  minerals  (kaolin,
vermiculite, and smectite), and amorphous silica are major constituents of most soils (75). These
silicon forms are only sparingly soluble and usually biogeochemically inert. Monosilicic and poly-
silicic acids are the principal soluble forms of silicon in soil (76).

For  the  most  part, monosilicic  acid  occurs  in  a  weakly  adsorbed  state  in  the  soil  (13,37).
Monosilicic acid has a low capacity for migration down the soil proﬁle (77). The chemical similar-
ity between the silicate anion and the phosphate anion results in a competitive reaction between the
various phosphates and monosilicic acid in the soil. Increasing monosilicic acid concentration in the
soil solution causes transformation of the plant-unavailable phosphates into the plant-available ones
(12).  Monosilicic  acid  can  interact  with  aluminum, iron, manganese, and  heavy  metals  to  form
slightly soluble silicates (29,30).

Polysilicic acids are an integral component of the soil solution. They mainly aﬀect soil physi-
cal properties. The mechanism of polysilicic acid formation is not clearly understood. Unlike mono-
silicic acid, polysilicic acid is chemically inert and basically acts as an adsorbent, forming colloidal
particles (34). Polysilicic acids are readily sorbed by minerals and form siloxane bridges (78). Since
polysilicic acids are highly water saturated, they may have an eﬀect on the soil water-holding capac-
ity. Polysilicic acids have been found to be important for the formation of soil structure (79). There
is a pressing need to obtain additional information about biogeochemically active silicon-rich sub-
stances involved in soil-formation processes.

19.6.2 SOIL TESTS
Silicon forms may be deﬁned as total, extractable, and soluble. Total silicon comprises all existing
forms of soil silicon that can be dissolved by strong alkali-fusion or acid-digestion methods (80).
This  parameter  does  not  provide  information  about  plant-available  and  chemically  active  silicon
because silicon in soil is in the form of relatively inert minerals (62).

Usually  for  determination  of  soil  plant-available  silicon, diﬀerent  extracts  are  used.  Extracts
remove silicon of intermediate stability that is often associated with crystalline or amorphous soil
components. The most common chemical extracts used are 0.5 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.8), 0.1
or 0.2 M HCl, water, sodium acetate buﬀer (pH 4.0), and ammonium oxalate (pH 3.0) among oth-
ers (71,81–83). Unfortunately, soil drying is a component of all these extraction methods. During
drying, all monosilicic acid (plant-available form of Si) is dehydrated and transformed into amor-
phous silica (21). Concern has been expressed that data obtained on dried soil may not adequately
describe  plant-available  soil  silicon  and  may  be  unsatisfactory  for  evaluating  soil  previously
amended with silicon fertilizer (71). Nevertheless, extractable silicon has been correlated with the
plant yield (84).

To overcome problems associated with soil drying, soluble monosilicic acid can be determined
in water extracted from ﬁeld-moist soil samples. After 1 h of shaking and ﬁltration, the clean extract
is analyzed for soluble monosilicic acid. This method also facilitates the testing for polysilicic acid
in the soil (13). It should be noted that a change in the soil-water concentration from 5 to 50% of
the ﬁeld capacity had no eﬀect on the sensitivity of the method (12,13).

To fully characterize soil plant-available silicon, it appears that more than one parameter
of measurement is required. The combination of data on soluble monosilicic acid, polysilicic
acid, and silicon in some extracts could give more complete information about the soil-silicon
status.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

19.7 SILICON FERTILIZERS
Although silicon is a very abundant element, for a material to be useful as a fertilizer, it must have a
relatively high content of silicon, provide suﬃcient water-soluble silicon to meet the needs of the
plant, be cost eﬀective, have a physical nature that facilitates storage and application, and not con-
tain substances that will contaminate the soil (85). Many potential sources meet the ﬁrst requirement;
however, only a few meet all of these requirements. Crop residues, especially of silicon-accumulat-
ing plants such as rice, are used as silicon sources either intentionally or unintentionally. When avail-
able, they should not be overlooked as sources of silicon. However, the crop demand for application
of silicon fertilizer generally exceeds that which can be supplied by crop residues.

Inorganic materials such as quartz, clays, micas, and feldspars, although rich in silicon, are poor
silicon-fertilizer  sources  because  of  the  low  solubility  of  the  silicon.  Calcium  silicate, generally
obtained as a byproduct of an industrial procedure (steel and phosphorus production, for example)
is one of the most widely used silicon fertilizers. Potassium silicate, though expensive, is highly sol-
uble and can be used in hydroponic culture. Other sources that have been used commercially are
calcium silicate hydrate, silica gel, and thermo-phosphate (85).

19.8 SILICON IN ANIMAL NUTRITION
In the last 30 years, a few studies on silicon eﬀects on mammals, ﬁsh, and birds were conducted
(33,38,86).  Data  have  shown  that  active  silicon  (ﬁne  amorphous  silica)  increased  the  weight  and
quality of animals. Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), pig (Sus scrofa), and sheep (Ovis aries) with
silicon-rich diets were healthier and stronger than animals without silicon supplements (33,38).

20.1 SODIUM IN SOILS AND WATER
Sodium  and  potassium, being  adjacent  elements  in  Group  1  of  the  Periodic  Table, have  similar
chemical properties. In the biology of higher organisms, however, these two elements have very
diﬀerent  roles  and  are  treated  very  diﬀerently  by  mechanisms  involved  in  short-  and  long-range
transport. Estimates of the percentages of sodium and potassium in the Earth’s crust vary between
2.5 and 3% (by weight), with slightly more sodium than potassium (1), and these concentrations are
similar to the percentages of calcium and magnesium. Much of the sodium is in seawater, to the
extent of 30.6% by weight compared with only 1.1% for potassium and 1.2% for calcium. Chloride,
although present at only 0.05% in the Earth’s crust, makes up 55% of the mass of seawater salts.
For  humans  and  most  animals, physiological  solutions  are  dominated  by  sodium  (around  0.8%
[w/v] compared with about 0.02% for potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and chloride (0.9%),
and both elements are essential for animals. Thus, when we think of sodium, we think ﬁrst of com-
mon salt—sodium chloride. In soils, the situation is more complex than in bulk solutions, and con-
centrations of cations (as experienced by the plant root) are inﬂuenced by ion exchange, diﬀusion,
and mass-ﬂow processes. The osmotic eﬀects of excessive salts are also inﬂuenced by the exact
amounts and proportions of anions and cations.

Some sodium occurs in most soils, but in temperate climates, the concentrations are often sim-
ilar to, or lower than, those of potassium. Excessive amounts of sodium may be present in the soil

in arid and semi-arid areas, and where evapotranspiration is similar to or greater than precipitation.
The excess may be in the form of high concentrations of sodium ions in solution, usually accom-
panied by chloride and sulfate (saline soils), or where sodium is the main cation associated with
cation-exchange sites (sodic soils). There is no absolute division of salt-aﬀected soils into these two
categories, saline or sodic, as there is a range from purely saline to purely sodic, with most salt-
aﬀected soils falling somewhere between the two extremes. The FAO estimated that in 2000, 3.1%
of the Earth’s land area was aﬀected by salinity and a further 3.4% had sodic soils (2). These ﬁgures
include 19.5% of irrigated land and 2.1% of land under dry-land agriculture. Detailed properties of
these soils are presented in a number of monographs (3–9). A brief summary is given below.

20.1.1 SALINITY

A widely accepted deﬁnition of a saline soil is one that gives a saturated paste extract with an elec-
trical conductivity (ECe) of ⬎4 dS m⫺1 (mmho cm⫺1). Seawater is about 55 dS m⫺1. These saline
soils will also have an exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of ⬍15 and a pH of ⬍8.5. Saline
soils are a problem for most plants because of the high concentrations of soluble salts in the soil
solution. Soil salinity usually involves other ions in addition to those of sodium and chloride, par-
ticularly calcium, magnesium, and sulfate. The proportions of these ions depend on the chemistry
and hydrology of the soil, but all saline soils have high concentrations of salts that may be harmful
in three ways. First, the high concentrations result not only in higher electrical conductivity, but also
in high osmotic pressures (more negative osmotic potentials). This action makes it more diﬃcult for
plants to establish a continuous gradient of water potential between the soil solution and the atmos-
phere—the driving force for transpiration and water uptake by osmosis. Plants must make their own
tissue solutions more concentrated (higher osmotic pressure) in order to draw water into their tis-
sues. This response is called osmotic adjustment, and in a strict sense, it refers to an increase in
solutes on a dry weight basis (a higher osmotic pressure can also be achieved to some extent by a
reduction  in  the  amount  of  water).  The  simplest  and  energetically  the  cheapest  way  to  achieve
osmotic adjustment is by the accumulation of inorganic ions (10). This action can lead to the sec-
ond problem—the toxicity of high concentrations of inorganic ions in plant tissues (11). Toxicity,
in  this  context, can  result  from  direct  interference  with  cellular  metabolism  or  from  an  osmotic
imbalance  caused  by  the  accumulation  of  salts  in  the  leaf  apoplast, known  as  the  Oertli  eﬀect
(12,13). The third problem is that high concentrations of salts can inhibit the uptake of other nutri-
ents such as potassium and nitrate (see below).

20.1.2 SODICITY
In contrast, soils with little soluble sodium, and hence a low ECe (⬍4 dS m⫺1), but with a substan-
tial proportion of the exchangeable cations in the form of sodium (ESP⬎15) and a pH of ⬎8.5, are
called sodic soils. In purely sodic soils, a substantial osmotic problem does not occur, since the con-
centrations of free ions in the soil solution are low. Nutrition is a problem because of the replace-
ment of nutrient cations (K⫹, Ca2⫹, and Mg2⫹) at ion-exchange sites in the soil by sodium (Na⫹)
and because of the high pH. Sodic soils have poor physical structure and may be impermeable to
water  and  to  plant  roots, so  that  there  are  often  secondary  problems  such  as  waterlogging  and
hypoxia.

Primary salinization is the result of geological processes such as the deposition of salt from dry-
ing lakes and seas. The large areas of salt-aﬀected soil in parts of Hungary, Australia, and the west-
ern United States of America are the result of such natural events. Secondary salinization refers to
the impact of man, mainly resulting from unsustainable irrigation for agriculture and rising water
tables. Secondary salinization has played a role in the decline of several civilizations. The Sumerian
civilization in Mesopotamia is probably the best known. This civilization was initially based on irri-
gated  wheat  farming, but  lack  of  adequate  drainage  and  excessive  use  of  irrigation  water  with 

CRC_DK2972_Ch020.qxd  6/30/2006  3:37 PM  Page 571

Sodium

571

an appreciable salt content led to accumulation of salts in the irrigated lands. Wheat (Triticum aes-
tivum L.) was replaced gradually by the more tolerant cereal barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), until it
was abandoned completely in about 1700 BC (6). Eventually, the salinity reached levels at which not
even barley would grow. Clearly, this presentation is a simpliﬁcation of a complex series of events,
but the pattern of irrigation without adequate drainage or control of salt ﬂuxes in the soil has been
repeated in other civilizations such as the Hohokam of the Sonoran Desert and the Indus civilization
of Pakistan. The mistakes of ancient civilizations have, unfortunately, been repeated in more modern
times. Examples are the vast irrigation systems in the Indian subcontinent and central Asia. In the
former case, remedial civil engineering is tackling the problem (6). In the former Soviet Union, large-
scale irrigation schemes built in the 1950s abstracted water from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers
for the cultivation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and other crops. These rivers ﬂow into the Aral
Sea, and with the reduction in river ﬂows, the level of the sea dropped by more than 10 m; and its
area decreased by over 40% in the latter half of the 20th century and is still decreasing. Even the
United States of America, with all of its technological and ﬁnancial resources, is not immune to the
impact of secondary salinization, as in the San Joachim valley and the Salton Sea.

Secondary salinization is most severe in arid and semi-arid regions, where potential evapotran-
spiration  rates  are  high, as  in  parts  of  the  United  States, the  Indian  subcontinent, Australia, the
Middle East, and South America.

20.2 SODIUM AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT

Some uncertainty exists about the status of sodium as a nutrient, partly arising from the semantics
of ‘essentiality’. The original criteria of Arnon and Stout (14) were that an essential element should
be  necessary  for  completion  of  the  life  cycle, should  not  be  replaceable  by  other  elements, and
should be involved directly in plant metabolism. Sodium fails to meet all the three criteria for most
plants and is generally regarded as a beneﬁcial nutrient (see below). Only a few plants have any
diﬃculty completing their life cycles in the absence of sodium, and these include some euhalo-
phytes and some C4 species. The osmotic functions of cations in the vacuoles of plants growing at
low  salinity  can  be  performed  to  some  extent  by  any  of  the  common  cations.  In  particular, the
monovalent alkali metals can perform similar functions in generating solute osmotic pressures and
turgor (1,15–18).

The term ‘functional nutrient’ has been suggested for sodium, and, perhaps also for silicon and
selenium (19,20). It might equally be applied to some of the rare earth elements that promote plant
growth in certain circumstances (21). As Tyler (21) has pointed out for the latter group, research on
essentiality, even of sodium, has examined only a small proportion of the total number of species
in the Plant Kingdom. Even so, it is clear that for most species, sodium is not essential in any sense.

20.3 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS

20.3.1 GROWTH STIMULATION
Halophytes.  The  responses  of  halophytes  and  glycophytes  to  salinity  have  been  reviewed  many
times (4,7,22–28). One feature of the response of halophytes, and, particularly the succulent halo-
phytes predominantly from the family Chenopodiaceae, is that maximum biomass is achieved at
moderate-to-high salinity (29–33). In other species, growth can be stimulated at low salinity, com-
pared with the absence of salt (34), but this eﬀect may depend on the overall nutritional status of
the plant and the purity of the sodium chloride.

A part of the biomass of halophytes is the inorganic ions that they accumulate, especially in the
shoots (23,26,27,30). It has been argued that, for a better assessment of plant productivity, only the
organic portion of the biomass should be considered—that is, the ash-free dry weight (35–37). This

CRC_DK2972_Ch020.qxd  6/30/2006  3:37 PM  Page 572

572

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

consideration certainly reduces the apparent stimulation of ‘growth’ by sodium in the salt-accumu-
lating, succulent euhalophytes, but a positive eﬀect on ash-free dry weight is still apparent.

20.3.2 INTERACTION WITH OTHER NUTRIENTS
The role of potassium in generating turgor can be fulﬁlled by sodium and to some extent, by cal-
cium and magnesium, particularly at low concentrations of potassium (38–41). The estimated extent
to which potassium can be replaced by sodium in the edible portions of crops varies from 1% in
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) to 90% in red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) (42).
The interactions among cations in terms of uptake and accumulation rates are complex. The ability
of low concentrations (⬍500 µM) of sodium to stimulate potassium uptake when potassium con-
centrations are low does not appear to be of importance outside the laboratory (43). The extensive
literature on the physiology and genetics of potassium–sodium interactions, especially related to
membrane transport, is beyond the scope of this chapter and has been reviewed comprehensively by
other researchers (44–50). Some evidence suggests that shoot sodium concentrations (altered by
spraying sodium onto leaves) aﬀects the transport of potassium to the shoots, or at least leaf potas-
sium concentrations (51).

Interactions  between  sodium  and  other  nutrients  have  been  observed  (52–54).  Excessive
sodium inhibits the uptake of potassium (43,55), calcium (56–67), and magnesium (53). A deﬁciency
of calcium, or a high sodium/calcium ratio, results in enhanced sodium uptake. For most species, this
calcium requirement is satisﬁed at a few moles per cubic meter of calcium in solution and is rarely
detected in soils. It can become a problem in hydroponics if the calcium concentration in the nutri-
ent solution is low, and no extra calcium is added. Maintaining low sodium/calcium ratios (as a
general rule, not ⬎10:1 for dicots and 20:1 for monocots) will prevent this problem. Similar con-
siderations apply to silicon (68–75).

Nitrogen  nutrition  modiﬁes  the  eﬀects  of  sodium  on  Chenopodiaceae  such  as  goosefoot
(Suaeda salsa L.) (76). Plants of this family accumulate large amounts of nitrogen in the form of
nitrate and glycinebetaine (30,77–80). The interactions among salinity, nitrogen, and sulfur nutri-
tion have been investigated in relation to the accumulation of diﬀerent organic solutes in the halo-
phytic grasses of the genus Spartina (81–83). Generally, adequate nitrogen nutrition is necessary to
minimize the inhibition of growth caused by excess salt, but with some diﬀerences between the
ammonium- and nitrate-fed plants (84–94).

Salinity may interfere with nitrogen metabolism in a number of ways, starting with the uptake
of  nitrate  and  ammonium  (87,95).  Under  nonsaline  conditions, nitrate  is  an  important  vacuolar
solute  in  many  plants, including  members  of  the  Chenopodiaceae  and  Gramineae.  Under  saline
conditions, much  of  the  vacuolar  nitrate  may  be  replaced  by  chloride, possibly  releasing  some
nitrate-nitrogen for plant growth and metabolism. On the other hand, salinity can result in the syn-
thesis of large amounts of nitrogen-containing compatible solutes such as glycinebetaine (and in a
few cases, proline) and lead to the accumulation of amides and polyamines. Changes may occur at
the site of nitrate reduction from the leaves to the roots, and hence changes in nitrate transport to
the shoots. Since the latter is linked to potassium recirculation (96,97) and long-range signaling
mechanisms controlling growth and resource allocation (98), the implications of such changes are
wide ranging. The activity of nitrate reductase may also be aﬀected by salinity. Although toxic ions
can aﬀect all aspects of nitrogen metabolism, little evidence suggests that nitrogen supply directly
limits the growth of plants under conditions of moderate salinities (99).

In comparison with the other nutrients, the interactions between salinity and phosphorus have
received relatively little attention (100) and depend to a large extent on the substrate (52,53). When
investigating interactions between salinity and nutrients, one has to be aware of the eﬀects of the
substrate, the environment, the genotype–nutrient balances, the nutrient and salt concentrations, the
time of exposure to salinity, and the phenology of the plant. These interactions are complex and can-
not be comprehended adequately from one or two experiments.

20.4 SODIUM IN FERTILIZERS
Application  of  sodium  to  many  crops  has  been  reported  to  stimulate  growth, particularly  when
potassium is deﬁcient (15,101–107). This phenomenon has been documented repeatedly with Beta
species (red beet, fodder beet, and sugar beet) (108–126), and in a range of other crops including
asparagus  (Asparagus  oﬃcinalis L.), Italian  ryegrass  (Lolium  multiﬂorum Lam.),
tomato
(Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), carrots (Daucus carota L.), cel-
ery (Apium graveolens L.), and ﬂax (Linum usitatissimum L.) (15,74,101,103,104,107,127,128).

There  is  particular  interest  in  sodium  fertilizer  application  to  forage  crops, since  animals
require substantial amounts of sodium (129,130). Lactating dairy cows need a concentration of
about 2 g Na kg⫺1 in forage (131). The problem is particularly evident on soils that are intensively
managed and deﬁcient in nutrients (132–134), although there are exceptions (135). Application 
of  sodium  fertilizer  improves  the  quality  of  fodder  crops  and  makes  them  more  acceptable  to 
animals (136–140).

20.5 SODIUM METABOLISM IN PLANTS
20.5.1 EFFECTS ON C4 SPECIES
Sodium  was  reported  to  be  necessary  for  the  growth  of  some  halophyte  species  (32,141–143);
notably, bladder saltbush (Atriplex vesicaria Heward, Chenopodiaceae). Sodium speciﬁcally stim-
ulates the growth of Joseph’s coat (Amaranthus tricolor L., Amaranthaceae) (144), possibly by an
eﬀect  on  nitrate  uptake  and  assimilation  (145,146).  Sodium  appears  to  be  essential  for  the  C4
grasses  such  as  proso  millet  (Panicum  miliaceum L.), kleingrass  (P.  coloratum L.)  and  saltgrass
(Distichlis spicata Greene) (20,147,148) and has been found to stimulate the growth of grasses such
as marsh grass (Sporobolus virginicus Kunth) and alkali sacaton (S. airoides Torr.) in some studies
(149–151). Subsequent work showed that this requirement was linked with the C4 pathway of pho-
tosynthesis  (141,142,152–157)  and  speciﬁcally  with  pyruvate–Na⫹ co-transport  into  mesophyll
chloroplasts (158–163), a step that is necessary for the regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and the
ﬁxation of CO2. Not all C4 plants require sodium for photosynthesis or grow better when it is pres-
ent (161). The C4 species of the NADP⫹-malic enzyme (ME) type have a diﬀerent co-transport sys-
tem for pyruvate that uses protons rather than sodium ions.

In sorghum species (Sorghum L.), there is a speciﬁc eﬀect of higher concentrations of sodium
(and low concentrations of lithium) on the kinase that regulates the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP)  carboxylase, the  primary  carbon-ﬁxing  enzyme  in  C4 and  crassulacean  acid  metabolism
(CAM)  plants  (164).  The  kinase  also  seems  to  be  linked  to  the  responses  of  PEP  carboxylase
to  nitrate  in  C3 and  C4 Alternanthera Forssk.  species  (165).  There  was  a  report  that  sodium
was  required  for  CAM  in  Chandlier  plant  (Kalanchoe  tubiﬂora Hamet)  (166), but  little  further
work has been published on this aspect, and no relationship occurs between CAM and halophytism
(167).  On  the  other  hand, salinity  and  other  stresses  are  known  to  induce  CAM  photosynthesis
in  the  facultative  CAM  species,
ice  plant  (Mesembryanthemum  crystallinum L., Aizoaceae)
(168,169).

20.5.2 TOXICITY OF SODIUM
Application of sodium to recently transplanted seedlings or cuttings runs the risk of uncontrolled by-
pass ﬂow of water and sodium to the shoots through damaged roots. Hence sodium is often applied
in the laboratory, greenhouse, or growth-chamber experiments after the plants have become estab-
lished in the growing medium. For such situations, Munns (24,25,33) has described a series of events
that occurs in most plants. At its simplest, these eﬀects start with the initial osmotic stress caused by
making the external (medium) water potential more negative. Subsequently, external inorganic ions
are taken up and organic solutes synthesized for osmotic adjustment of the plant cells. Failure to

CRC_DK2972_Ch020.qxd  6/30/2006  3:37 PM  Page 574

574

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

properly control the inﬂux of inorganic salts results in the direct toxicity of high intracellular (par-
ticularly  cytoplasmic)  concentrations  of  ions  or  to  osmotic  imbalances  within  tissues  such  as  the
accumulation of salts in the apoplast of species like rice (12,13). Although this description has been
challenged in detail regarding the implications for stress-resistance breeding (11) and the point at
which speciﬁc ion eﬀects become evident (170), it is still the best model of physiological responses
to applied salinity. The same concepts, with modiﬁcations of timescale and phenology, can be use-
ful in the crop ﬁeld and in natural environments, although in both cases the severity of salinity (and
other stresses) is subject to ﬂuctuations that the laboratory experiment is designed to avoid.

Important questions are what, when, and why salts are toxic to plants. The question of whether
sodium or chloride is a toxic ion is still diﬃcult to answer in most plants, though of course, this
action is not important if the problem is primarily osmotic. The question of when inorganic salts
(mainly sodium chloride) become toxic is a little easier to answer, at least in theory. Accumulation
of salts is required for osmotic adjustment, as cellular dehydration may make a contribution, but
generally perturbs metabolism by changing the concentrations of critical intermediates and signal-
ing molecules in the cytoplasm. If salts accumulate much in excess of the concentrations needed for
osmotic adjustment of plant cells, it is likely that they will become inhibitory to metabolism and
growth, although this may depend on the intracellular location of the salts (see below). The cyto-
plasm  of  eukaryotic  cells  has  evolved  to  work  best  within  a  limited  range  of  concentrations  of
solutes, and particularly of certain ions. Exceeding these ranges for inorganic (and some organic)
ions  (including  potassium)  creates  problems  for  macromolecular  structures, and  hence  enzyme
activities and nucleic acid metabolism (171,172).

20.6 INTRACELLULAR AND INTERCELLULAR COMPARTMENTATION
From the above, it follows that plants growing in saline environments and accumulating high con-
centrations of salts must have a mechanism that facilitates high rates of metabolic activity in the
cytoplasm. Enzymes from halophytes were shown not to have any enhanced capacity to work at
high salt concentrations compared with those from glycophytes (1,171–176). This observation led
to the hypothesis that toxic inorganic salts might be preferentially accumulated in vacuoles, where
they could still have an osmotic role. In this intracellular-compartmentation model (17,177–179),
the  osmotic  potential  of  the  cytoplasm  is  adjusted  by  the  accumulation  of  ‘compatible’ organic
solutes such as glycinebetaine, proline, and cyclitols (27,171,173,177,180–184). For the interpreta-
tion  of  plant-sodium  contents  in  saline  environments, it  is  not  therefore  suﬃcient  to  know  how
much sodium a plant tissue contains. It is also necessary to consider the relative and absolute con-
centrations within diﬀerent parts of the tissue, both at the inter and intracellular levels (178).

20.7 SODIUM IN VARIOUS PLANT SPECIES
One has to be cautious about interpreting concentrations expressed on the basis of diﬀerent units
(30,185). A tissue dry weight basis is often used in the agricultural literature, but conveys no infor-
mation about the osmotic eﬀects of solutes such as sodium ions or about changes in other dry weight
components such as chloride in euhalophytes. Thus, ash-free dry weight might be a more appropri-
ate  basis  for  measuring  concentrations.  Using  a  fresh-weight  basis  does  not  facilitate  the  proper
assessment of osmotic contributions of solutes, nor does it provide information about changes in the
amount of solute independent of the amount of solvent (water). Expressing concentrations on a plant-
water basis, or as measured concentrations in cell sap, does convey information about the osmotic
eﬀects of solutes, but does not allow a distinction to be made between osmotic adjustment sensu
stricto and changes in the water content of the tissue. An example is given in Reference (185), where
sodium concentrations in the roots and shoots of mammoth wildrye (Leymus sabulosus Tzvel.) are
compared  as  concentrations  in  sap  or  as  concentrations  per  kilogram  dry  weight. The  conclusion

about whether there are higher concentrations of sodium in the roots or shoots is reversible depend-
ing on which units are used.

Table 20.1 shows the concentrations of sodium in the healthy shoots of diﬀerent species. Under
nonsaline conditions, the sodium concentrations in most plant tissues are a few moles per cubic
meter plant water at most. As external salinity is increased, the amount of sodium within the plant
increases, but the rate at which this increase occurs varies from slow in wheat to very rapid in tef,
a salt-sensitive glycophyte with little ability to control the inﬂux of sodium. Halophytes accumulate
substantial amounts of sodium, but are able to tightly control this accumulation at salinities close to
or below that of seawater.

In conclusion, sodium is essential only for some C4 species, but is undoubtedly beneﬁcial to the
growth of euhalophytes. It may stimulate the growth of some species with an evolutionary history
in saline environments, and even of apparently totally glycophytic species under certain conditions.
Whether there is a need to reclassify sodium as a ‘functional’ nutrient is open to debate. These con-
siderations are, however, of minor importance compared with the problems caused by the second-
ary salinization of agricultural land.

21.1 HISTORICAL
The transition element vanadium exists mostly in the ⫹3, ⫹4, and ⫹5 oxidation states (Table 21.1),
with the ⫹4 and ⫹5 states predominating under oxidizing conditions in the normal soil acidity of
below pH 8 (1,2). Vanadium, with many other heavy metals, is released by anthropogenic activity,
and its concentration has been steadily increasing in the environment. A study on peat dating back
12,370 years from a bog in Switzerland indicated a large increase in inputs of vanadium since the
industrial revolution (3). Analysis of herbarium specimens of 24 species of vascular plants and 3
bryophytes collected over many years in Spain has shown a large increase in leaf vanadium con-
centrations, particularly since the 1960s (4).

In soils, the main source of vanadium is from the burning of coal, and the subsequent addition
of ﬂy ash and bottom ash. In 1988, this ash contributed 11 to 67 ⫻ 106 kg V yr⫺1 to soils, 25% of
the total vanadium deposited (5). Agricultural and food wastes contributed 3 to 22 ⫻ 106 kg yr⫺1,
and atmospheric fallout added 3.2 to 21 ⫻ 106 kg yr⫺1.

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

Total atmospheric fallout in a typical year in recent times (1983) resulted mainly from the burn-
ing of oil in electricity generation (estimated to be 6960 to 52,200 ⫻ 103 kg ) and from industrial
and domestic combustion of oil (30,150 to 141,860 ⫻ 103 kg ) (5). Of the 15 heavy metals consid-
ered in that study, vanadium was the highest to be emitted during oil combustion (5), and its pres-
ence is often taken as an indicator of oil pollution (4).

In  a  study  of  microelements  in  the  needles  of  white  ﬁr  (Abies  alba Mill.)  in  the  Carpathian
mountains of Eastern Europe, vanadium was found in high concentrations in the vicinity of ferrous
metal plants (6), and it is emitted into the atmosphere during the production of copper, nickel, iron,
and  steel, and  during  the  incineration  of  sewage  sludge  (5). With  the  discontinuation  of  sewage
sludge incineration in many countries, it might be expected that direct addition of vanadium to soils
in sewage sludge could increase worldwide.

The natural vanadium, occurring at approximately 110 to 150 mg kg⫺1 (1,7) in the crust of the
Earth, is found particularly in roscoelite (KV3Si3O10(OH)2), vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and patronite
(VS4) (1). During weathering of these rocks, vanadium is oxidized to the vanadate ion, which because
of  its  solubility  in  water  across  a  range  of  pH  values  makes  vanadium  readily  available  to  plants.
However, in practice, vanadium is not very mobile in soil, and in a study on a loamy sand, only a very
small proportion of vanadium added to the top 7.5 cm of soil migrated down within 18 or 30 months;
81% remained in the top of the soil where it was added (2). The amount of vanadium that was removed
by HCl–H2SO4 extraction of the top 7.5 cm of soil decreased by 81% during 18 months; hence, vana-
dium must have been transformed to an immobile form with time. Vanadium is known to adsorb to
iron and aluminum oxides in the clay fraction (2). Some vanadium may be precipitated as Fe(VO3)2,
and some may be immobilized by anion exchange (2).

The correlation is good between soil organic matter content and the oxidizable (immobile) frac-
⫺) anions
tion of vanadium (8). Insoluble humic acid is known to reduce mobile metavanadate (VO3
⫹) cations, which probably bind to the humic acid by cation exchange (1). In an
to vanadyl (VO2
industrial area of Poland, most of the vanadium was bound to soil organic matter in a recent study
of a soil that was rich in the element. The next largest fraction was the residual fraction followed,
in order, by a fraction bound to iron-manganese oxides, a fraction in exchangeable form, and ﬁnally
a fraction bound to carbonates in amounts too small to measure. The much lower amounts of vana-
dium in soil from an agricultural area occurred in the order of exchangeable fraction, residual frac-
tion, the fraction bound to iron-manganese oxides, and the fraction bound to organic matter, with
the fraction bound to carbonates being again too small to measure (9).

Uptake and accumulation are inﬂuenced by soil type, as soil composition aﬀects the availabil-
ity of vanadium. Vanadium generally is accumulated in plants in very small amounts in comparison
to  the  total  vanadium  content  of  the  soil  (1).  In  a  comparison  of  soybeans  (Glycine  max Merr.)
grown in a ﬂuvo-aquic soil and an Oxisol, an increase in shoot vanadium concentration occurred
when concentrations of more than 30 mg V kg⫺1 were added to the ﬂuvo-aquic soil, but no increase
occurred at concentrations of up to 75 mg V kg⫺1 added to the Oxisol (10). Plant growth was inhib-
ited when the concentration of vanadium supplied exceeded 30 mg kg⫺1 in the ﬂuvo-aquic soil but
was not inhibited in the Oxisol. In a study on bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the accumulation
of vanadium from a loamy sand was more than double the accumulation of cadmium and more than
300 times the accumulation of thallium (2). Concentrations of vanadium in plants are typically 0.27
to 4.2 mg kg⫺1 dry weight (11). At low rates of supply, vanadium appears to stimulate plant growth,
but at higher rates of supply it appears to be toxic to many plants (7).

species  (12).  It  was  diﬃcult  to  conﬁrm  a  similar  requirement  in  higher  plants  (13).  First, it  is
diﬃcult to eliminate vanadium entirely from nutrient cultures (13). Also, although vanadate is a
well-known  inhibitor  of  plasma  membrane  proton-pumping  ATPases, trace  concentrations  have
been reported to beneﬁt plant growth. In an experiment on sand-grown corn (Zea mays L.), a sup-
ply of vanadium increased grain yield, probably because leaf area was increased but also possibly
due to physiological eﬀects (14). Supply of vanadium to tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) at
0.25 mg L⫺1 of nutrient solution gave greater plant height, more leaves, more ﬂowers, and greater
plant mass than supplying no vanadium (15).

Hewitt, working with data from Welch and Huﬀman (16), calculated that the concentrations of
vanadium in tomato plant cells are less than 1% of the concentration of vanadium in vanadium-
deﬁcient  Chlorella cells, suggesting  that  vanadium  is  not  an  essential  element  for  the  growth 
of  higher  plants  (13).  In  the  paper  on  which  Hewitt’s  calculations  were  based, lettuce  (Lactuca
sativa L.)  and  tomato  plants  were  grown  to  maturity  in  nutrient  solutions  containing  less  than
0.04 mg V L⫺1 and with tissue concentrations of ⬍2 to 18 mg V kg⫺1 dry weight (16). Plant growth
in this low concentration of vanadium was comparable to that in nutrient solutions containing 50 mg
V L⫺1, with tissue concentrations of 117 to 419 mg kg⫺1 dry weight, whereas it might have been
expected  that  the  low  concentration  of  vanadium  should  have  had  a  beneﬁcial  eﬀect  on  growth.
However, iron was supplied as the citrate salt, and in work on Chlorella pyrenoidosa, vanadium
stimulated growth when iron was supplied as FeCl3 but had only negligible eﬀect when iron was
supplied as citrate or iron EDTA (17). Therefore, part of its requirement as an essential element in
algae, at least, is as a replacement for unavailable iron, and supply of iron in a readily available form
removes this requirement. If vanadium is a beneﬁcial element for higher plants it may be so only
when iron or other metals are limiting.

21.2.2 TOXICITY
If some doubt exists about the role of vanadium as a beneﬁcial element, there is no doubt that at
high  rates  of  supply  (10  to  20 mg  L⫺1)  it  is  harmful  to  plants  (12).  Sorghum  (Sorghum  bicolor
Moench.) seedlings supplied with vanadium as ammonium metavanadate at 1, 10, or 100 mg L⫺1 in
nutrient solutions showed no toxic eﬀects in the 1 mg L⫺1 solution, but showed a noticeable red-
dening of the lower stems, and later the leaf tips, in the 10 mg L⫺1 or higher solution (7). In an
experiment on bush beans planted 15 months after application of 5.6 kg VOSO4 H2O ha⫺1 on the
surface and harvested 3 months later, growth of shoots and roots was signiﬁcantly less than in unfer-
tilized plants (2).

In the experiments in which soybeans were grown in a ﬂuvo-aquic soil or in an Oxisol, plant
growth was inhibited when the concentration of vanadium supplied exceeded 30 mg kg⫺1 in the
ﬂuvo-aquic soil, a rate of supply that gave a shoot concentration of approximately 1 mg V kg⫺1
dry matter (10). With a supply of 75 mg V kg⫺1 soil, the shoot concentration was approximately
4 mg kg⫺1 dry matter, and plant growth was even more depressed than with the lower supply of
vanadium (10).

One  of  the  reasons  for  the  harmful  eﬀects  of  vanadium  is  that  it  induces  iron  deﬁciency.
Noticeably decreased concentrations of iron were measured in leaves of a manganese-sensitive bush
bean cultivar supplied with vanadate (18). Cereals, strawberries (Fragaria X ananassa Duchesne),
and ﬂax (Linum usitatissimum L.) are noted as being very sensitive species (19). Wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are more sensitive than rice (Oryza sativa L.) or soy-
bean (20). In addition to causing chlorosis from iron deﬁciency, vanadium has been shown to lower
the concentration of iron in roots of soybeans (21) and to lower root concentrations of magnesium
and  potassium  in  soybean  (22,23)  and  lettuce  (23). Vanadium  also  decreased  root  and  hypocotyl
accumulation of molybdenum in white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) (25) and decreased calcium con-
centrations in leaves of soybean (23,24). Root and hypocotyl concentrations of manganese, copper,
and nickel were increased in Sinapis alba (25), and leaf concentration of manganese was increased

CRC_DK2972_Ch021.qxd  7/1/2006  7:33 AM  Page 588

to toxic levels in bush bean (18). Some evidence indicates that vanadium may increase aluminum
concentrations in soybeans (22).

In a ﬁeld experiment with soybean, seed yields decreased with an increase in vanadium con-
centration  in  the  soil, or  more  precisely  with  an  increase  in  the V:(V⫹P)  ratio  (26).  Seed  yield
decreased  by  approximately  20%  as  the  resin-extractable  V:(V⫹P)  ratio  increased  to  0.15 mol
mol⫺1 (26), although a decrease also occurred in relation to vanadium alone (27). The negative rela-
tionship between vanadium and phosphorus is not surprising given that the inhibition of ATPases
by vanadate is brought about by competitive inhibition of phosphate-binding on the enzymes.

If the harmful eﬀects of vanadium become more important with time as anthropogenic sources
increase, it would be helpful to be able to alleviate them. The eﬀects of vanadium in the soil can be
reduced by adding a chelating agent, such as γ-irradiated chitosan, to the soil (20). Furthermore, it
might  be  expected  that  since  vanadium  induces  iron  deﬁciency  in  plants, increased  iron  supply
might alleviate vanadium toxicity, and this eﬀect has been shown to be the case (28).

21.3 METABOLISM
Vanadium has been shown to enhance chlorophyll formation and iron metabolism of tomato plants
and to enhance the Hill reaction of isolated chloroplasts (15). Corn plants that had higher grain yield
with a supply of vanadium in sand culture had increased concentrations of chlorophyll a and chloro-
phyll b (14). Supply of vanadium increased the synthesis of chlorophyll through enhanced synthesis
of the porphyrin precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid in the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick. (29),
although the pH optimum for the enhancement of chlorophyll synthesis by vanadium was slightly
diﬀerent from the pH optimum for enhancement of algal cell growth (30). The substitution of vana-
dium for iron in green algae highlights the involvement of both ions in chlorophyll synthesis.

No clear evidence is available for the role of vanadium in chlorophyll synthesis in higher plants,
but iron deﬁciency gives rise to lower amounts of chlorophyll per chloroplast (31), and the require-
ment for iron in chlorophyll synthesis has been narrowed down to a speciﬁc step (32) rather than to
secondary eﬀects. The requirement for iron is clear, and vanadium may possibly inﬂuence chloro-
phyll synthesis only through an eﬀect on iron metabolism. At one stage it was proposed that green
algae may have a pathway of synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid that is vanadium-dependent but
diﬀers from the pathway in higher plants (13); however, such a pathway has not been identiﬁed. In
recent years, genes coding for the enzymes involved in this synthesis have been identiﬁed in higher
plants and in algae, so diﬀerences in the pathway, if they exist, appear to be at the level of control
rather than in the pathway itself. It is possible that vanadium is an essential cofactor for one of the
enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis in green algae, but in higher plants this role is normally taken
on by another metal for which vanadium can substitute.

Vanadate (but not vanadyl) promoted the evolution of oxygen from intact cells of Chlorella
fusca at the same concentrations that gave maximum promotion of algal growth (1 to 2 µM)
(33). Vanadium was thought to work in the chain of electron transport between photosystems
2 and 1 by virtue of the ability of the vanadium to change reversibly between its tetravalent and
pentavalent states (33). Vanadium also increased photosystem 1 activity (but not photosystem
2 activity) in isolated chloroplasts of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), with an optimum at approx-
imately 20 µM V (33).

Corn  plants  that  showed  enhanced  grain  yield  with  supply  of  vanadium  had  more  nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and  magnesium  in  the  leaves, although  high  concentrations  of
vanadium decreased the concentrations of these elements (14). Vanadium was shown to increase
foliar  concentrations  of  calcium  and  iron  in  lettuce, although  in  these  plants, yield  was  actually
depressed by the vanadium supplied (23).

The presence of vanadium certainly aﬀects the metabolism of plants. Addition of vanadium at
1mg L⫺1 to solution reduced nicotine concentrations in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) by 25%

CRC_DK2972_Ch021.qxd  7/1/2006  7:33 AM  Page 589

(34). In lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.), a negative correlation between alkaloid and vanadium
concentrations in the leaves has been observed (35).

Given the inhibitory eﬀects of vanadate on plasma membrane ATPases, it is not surprising that
vanadium should aﬀect metabolism. Changes in concentrations of other ions in plants supplied with
vanadium could in part be due to the eﬀects on proton-pumping APTases, although uptake of phos-
phate into isolated corn root tips was inhibited less than the activity of ATPase in the tips at the same
amount of sodium vanadate supplied (36). Nevertheless, heavy exposure of these enzymes to vana-
dium might be expected to stop plant transport completely. Some evidence indicates that vanadium
may also inhibit the absorption of water (37).

Absorption of vanadium appears to be a passive process as it is a linear function of external vana-
dium  concentration  and  is  not  aﬀected  by  putting  excised  roots  into  anaerobic  conditions  (38).
Absorption is highly pH-dependent, being fastest at pH 4 and dropping to a very slow rate by pH 10,
although being relatively constant between pH 5 and 8 (38). This eﬀect of pH on absorption appears
⫹ predominating at pH 4, HVO3
to be due to the ionic form in which vanadium is present, with VO2
2⫺ pre-
⫺ predominating between pH 5 and 8, and HVO4
predominating between pH 4 and 5, VO3
⫹ form that predominates in acid soil is taken up by plants
dominating at pH 9 to 10 (38). The VO2
far more readily than the other forms that predominate in neutral and alkaline soils (11).

Absorption of vanadium appears to occur at the expense of calcium uptake, there being a linear
decrease in calcium accumulation into sorghum cultivars with log concentration of vanadate sup-
plied (39). This result is probably due to an eﬀect on calcium channels that more than compensates
for  the  inhibition  by  vanadate  of  the  H⫹-translocating ATPase  responsible  for  calcium  ﬂux. The
presence of calcium is required for absorption of vanadium, and this eﬀect, together with the fact
that vanadium concentrates in the roots at up to twice the concentration in the external medium,
indicates that the passive absorption cannot be purely by diﬀusion. A concentration gradient from
outside to inside the root could be maintained by the vanadium changing form inside the root, with
up to 10% of VO3

⫺ taken up being reduced to VO2

⫹ (40), or it could be chelated (38).

Indeed, various complexes of vanadium have been detected in plants. At low rates of vanadium
supply, plants form low-molecular-weight complexes thought to be vanadyl amino compounds, and
at high rates of supply, plants form high molecular weight complexes, probably vanadyl cellulose
compounds (41). It seems that following absorption, vanadium is partially immobilized on the root
cell walls. It then develops soluble complexes outside the plasmalemma and ﬁnally is absorbed into
the vacuoles within the cells (41). Concentrations in roots are usually higher than in leaves.

Calcium seems to accumulate in roots along with vanadium. In soybeans supplied with vana-
dium, both elements were concentrated in the roots, and very high concentrations of calcium have
been  detected  in  the  roots  of  vanadium-accumulating  species.  Perhaps, calcium  may  work  to
detoxify the vanadium (7,24). It is possible that the vanadium occurs as insoluble calcium vana-
date (1). This action may be only a partially successful detoxiﬁcation as it has been suggested that
the accumulation of calcium might give rise to the imbalance in other cations associated with vana-
dium toxicity (24).

There does not appear to be much inhibition of absorption of vanadium by molybdate, borate,
chloride, selenate, chromate, or nitrate (38). However, in Sinapis alba nickel, manganese, and cop-
per inhibited the accumulation of vanadium in roots and hypocotyls, whereas molybdate decreased
its accumulation in the hypocotyls and enhanced its accumulation in the roots (25).

21.4 VANADIUM IN PLANT SPECIES
In general, lower plants contain more vanadium than seed-bearing plants, and older parts contain
more than younger parts (7). Despite this overall trend, some angiosperms seem to be accumulator
plants (Table 21.2). In an experiment where sorghum seedlings showed noticeable harmful eﬀects

when grown in 10 mg V L⫺1 in the nutrient solution, the selenium-accumulator Astragalus preussi
A. Gray was not aﬀected by 100 mg V L⫺1 and accumulated vanadium in the tissues (7).

Chicory  (Cichorium  intybus L.)  and  dogfennel  (Eupatorium  capillifolium Small)  have  been
suggested to have potential as indicators of vanadium bioavailability (42). Since 1981, the Bavarian
State Oﬃce for Environmental Protection has been analyzing samples of the moss Hypnum cupres-
siforme L. as indicators of emission-derived metals, including vanadium (43).

Even in crop species that are sensitive to vanadium, there are genotypes that are less aﬀected by
the element. In a study in which soybean was found to be sensitive to the V:(V⫹P) ratio, one cultivar
showed very little sensitivity to either element (27). Although concentrations of 10 to 20 mg V L⫺1
vanadium in nutrient solutions are generally regarded as harmful to plants, some bush bean and lettuce
genotypes have been aﬀected adversely by concentrations as low as 0.20 mg V L⫺1 (18,23).

22.1 STATUS OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH
Chapters in this handbook summarize research for each of the plant nutrients and several beneﬁcial
elements, and readers should refer to the individual chapters for information on past, current, and
future research on these elements. However, some conclusions can be drawn about the kinds of cur-
rent research that are being carried out in plant nutrition, and literature that addresses this research
in a general way can be identiﬁed and will be presented in this summary.

Traditionally, research in soil fertility and plant nutrition has addressed soil testing and plant
analyses and nutrient availability for plants, nutrient requirements of diﬀerent crops, fertilizer use,
and crop utilization of nutrients in materials applied to soil. Interest in these traditional ﬁelds con-
tinues, but topics including accumulation and transport of nutrients and nonessential elements have
received recent attention. Research in genetics of plant nutrition has risen with the growth in the
ﬁeld of molecular biology.

22.2 SOIL TESTING AND PLANT ANALYSIS AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY
Consideration  of  the  environmental  and  economic  consequences  of  soil  fertility  practices  is  an
essential component of research in plant nutrition. Soil tests are developed to assess the availability
of plant nutrients in soils, and these tests are calibrated for the major ﬁeld and vegetable crops, and
provide  the  basis  for  lime  and  fertilizer  recommendations.  Recommendations  for  amounts  and
application of fertilizers are continually modiﬁed to optimize economics of production as the costs
of fertilizer application, the value of crop yields, and subsidy regimes change. Criteria for inter-
preting  the  results  of  soil  testing  and  plant  analyses  are  developed  through  ﬁeld  and  glasshouse
research that relates test results and plant composition to crop yields. Research in soil fertility and
plant nutrition also covers application to the land of agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastes

and  by-products  (1), atmospheric  contributions  to  plant  nutrients  in  soils, short-  and  long-term
availability of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, and many other factors as well
as soil testing and plant analyses.

Work on soil fertility and plant nutrition often involves multidisciplinary research in other areas
of soil science and plant physiology. Basic and applied information in such areas as soil–plant rela-
tions, nutritional physiology, and plant nutrition technology have been summarized in books and
monographs (2–4). Regular meetings of scientists working on plant nutrition occur, leading to con-
tinual developments in the subject. For example, 11 symposia on iron nutrition and interactions in
plants have been held, with the most recent one covering topics that include the genetics of iron
eﬀciency in plants and molecular biology of iron absorption (5).

Some plant nutrients, such as potassium and sodium, are involved in plant responses to salt and
water stress (6,7), giving rise to further studies on comparative physiology. Research on nutritional
stresses include studying the physiological and biochemical detail of the absorption and transport
of nutrients (8–11), and also studying plant composition with respect to factors such as organic acid
biosynthesis in relation to nutrient accumulation or deﬁciency (12).

The complexity of the relations between plants and soils, and the complexity of the assimila-
tory pathways and cycling of nutrients within plants, has caused some workers to develop models
to aid our understanding of the acquisition and uptake of nutrients by plants (13). Some of these
models, such as those developed by Warwick HRI for nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus for a
variety of crops in diﬀerent geographical locations (http://www.qpais.co.uk/nable/nitrogen.htm) are
freely available on the internet.

Interest in nutrient absorption and accumulation is derived from the need to increase crop produc-
tivity  by  better  nutrition  and  also  to  improve  the  nutritional  quality  of  plants  as  foods  and  feeds.
Investigations occurring in many diﬀerent research locations are determining and helping to understand
factors that aﬀect nutrient absorption and accumulation in plants. The U.S. Plant, Soil and Nutrition
Laboratory  at  Cornell  University, Ithaca, New York  (http://www.uspsnl.cornell.edu/index.html)  con-
ducts studies in the chemistry and movement of nutritionally important elements in the soil and the
absorption of the elements by plant roots. Scientists at the laboratory also investigate factors that aﬀect
the concentration and bioavailability of nutrients in plant foods and feeds, and are developing methods
to evaluate soil contamination of foods derived from plants. The laboratory is conducting research on
identifying and investigating genes that facilitate and regulate plant nutrient uptake and transport. The
Plant Physiology Laboratory of the Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor University, Waco,
Texas  (www.bcm.tmc.edu/cnrc), is  a  unique  cooperative  venture  between  a  college  of  medicine
(Baylor)  and  an  agricultural  research  agency  (USDA/ARS).  This  laboratory  is  dedicated  to  under-
standing the nutrient transport systems of plants as a means of improving food crops.

22.3 ACCUMULATION OF ELEMENTS BY PLANTS
Understanding how plants accumulate and store metallic elements are research topics of current
interest, and the direct toxicity of elements to plants has been a long-standing topic of interest in
plant nutrition research. Meharg and Hartley-Whitaker (14) reviewed literature on the accumulation
and metabolism of arsenic in plants. Nable et al. (15) discussed research on the toxicity of boron in
soils, noting amelioration methods of soil amendments, selection of plant genotypes that are toler-
ant of boron, and breeding of boron-tolerant crops.

The mechanisms of toxicity of trace elements are complex, and plants vary considerably in their
responses to trace elements in soils. To understand and manage the risks to plant and animal life
posed  by  toxic  elements  in  soils, it  is  essential  to  know  how  these  elements  are  absorbed, trans-
located, and accumulated in plants. A special issue of New Phytologist was dedicated to metal accu-
mulation, metabolism, and  detoxiﬁcation  in  plants  and  in  the  use  of  plants  in  remediation  of
contaminated soils (16). Cobbett and Goldsbrough (17) considered the roles of metal-binding ligands

CRC_DK2972_Ch022.qxd  6/3/2006  12:37 PM  Page 601

in plants in metal detoxiﬁcation, and there has been considerable interest in engineering plants for
metal accumulation for purposes of phytoremediation of soils (or for providing better nutrition in
diets and rations of humans and livestock) (18). Accordingly, the genetics of plants with regard to
metal accumulation is a major topic of interest.

Babaoglu et al. (19) noted that Gypsophila sphaerocephala Fenzl ex Tchihat. has the potential
to accumulate boron (over 3000 mg B/kg in leaves) from soils in which boron is phytotoxic and that
the  boron-rich  plant  material  may  be  transported  to  areas  where  boron  is  deﬁcient.  Selenium,
although  often  regarded  as  an  element  that  is  dangerous  when  it  accumulates  in  plants  that  are
ingested  by  animals, has  received  considerable  attention  in  programs  such  as  that  at  Cornell
University, as selenium is now seen as being deﬁcient in the human diet worldwide. The fact that
its uptake by plants can be enhanced by supply of more selenium to the plants is important in this
context (20). These issues are addressed in a chapter on selenium in this handbook. Terry et al. (21)
also reviewed the literature on the physiology of plants with regards to selenium absorption and
transport, pathways of assimilation, and mechanisms of toxicity and tolerance of plants to selenium.
Aluminum toxicity is a long-standing issue for research in plant physiology, and a chapter in this
handbook  addresses  aluminum  as  a  factor  in  plant  and  animal  nutrition.  Rout  et  al.  (22)  also
reviewed the physiology and biochemistry of aluminum toxicity in plants and discussed ways of
increasing the tolerance of plants to aluminum.

The use of organic materials in metal detoxiﬁcation or in the increase in nutrient availability in
soils is also a topic for study (23). Similarly, the role of mycorrhizal associations in alleviating metal
toxicity in plants is a topic of current research. Jentschke and Godbold (24) discussed the possibil-
ities of a role of fungal activities in immobilization of metals or otherwise restricting the eﬀects of
soil-borne metals on plant growth.

22.4 GENETICS OF PLANT NUTRITION
The genetic and molecular background for plant nutrition is an area in which interest in research is
expanding  (5,16,25).  A  special  section  of  Journal  of  Experimental  Botany contains  six  invited
papers from a session held at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Meeting in April 2003,
addressing the genetics of plant mineral nutrition. A preface to this section mentions the topics cov-
ered (26). The topics include a review of the genes that aﬀect nitrogen absorption, assimilation, uti-
lization, and  metabolism  in  corn  (Zea  mays L.), and  how  manipulation  of  these  genes  might
improve grain production. Another article describes the physiological and biochemical characteris-
tics that allow plants to survive in environments containing little available phosphorus. The article
explains the genetic events that occur when plants lack phosphorus and how knowledge of these
events might be used to improve the eﬃciency of phosphorus acquisition and utilization by crops.
The genetics of control of K⫹ transport across plant cell membranes is the topic of another article.
Another discussion is of the generation of salt-tolerant plants through transgenic approaches and
through conventional plant breeding. Another article surveys the accumulation of nutrients in the
shoots of angiosperms under lavish nutrition in hydroponics and under natural environmental con-
ditions. In another article, the micronutrient requirements of humans and the supply of micronutri-
ents  from  plants  to  populations  at  risk  from  mineral  deﬁciencies  is  discussed  in  relation  to  the
varying micronutrient contents in plants. These papers illustrate basic research in plant nutrition and
describe  how  the  application  of  modern  genetic  techniques  contribute  to  solutions  for  plant  and 
animal mineral nutrition.

Research  in  the  genetics  of  plant  nutrition  covers  major  and  minor  nutrients, metals, plant
stress, symbioses, and plant breeding. Several publications cover research in this area. A book by
Reynolds et al. (27) has several chapters that address genotypic variation in wheat with respect to
zinc and other nutrient eﬃciencies. A review article by Fox and Guerinot (28) summarizes knowl-
edge about genes that inﬂuence the transport of cationic nutrients and addresses how genes encode

CRC_DK2972_Ch022.qxd  6/3/2006  12:37 PM  Page 602

Handbook of Plant Nutrition

for transporter proteins. These proteins can be divided into three main types, primary ion pumps,
ion channels and cotransporters (29), and the genes that code for transporter proteins for all the
macronutrients and some micronutrients that have been cloned from plants (29–31). This research
studies how genetics aﬀect plant responses to nutrient availability and may allow for creation of
food  crops  with  enhanced  nutrient  levels  or  with  the  ability  to  exclude  toxic  metals.  Smith  (10)
describes  how  the  expression  of  genes  encoding  for  high-aﬃnity  phosphate  transporters  may
improve  phosphate  utilization  by  plants  growing  under  regimes  of  low  phosphate  availability  in
soils. However, it is probably the case that the inﬂux of nutrient ions is not the limiting step in nutri-
ent acquisition, so ‘improving’ the performance of transporters in plants by breeding may not achieve
big increases in plant yield if not accompanied by other changes (29). In terms of improving yields
of plants through improving the uptake and assimilation of nitrogen, expression of genes for cytoso-
lic glutamine synthetase could have as large an impact on nutrient use eﬃciency as expression of
genes for transporters (32).

Keeping phosphate, or other nutrients, available at the root surface is a major problem in nutrient-
deﬁcient soils; consequently, some research addresses mobilization of nutrients in the soil as well as
internal mobilization within plants. Hinsinger (33) reviewed changes in the rhizosphere that can occur
with  plant  species, plant  nutrient  availability, and  soil  conditions  that  can  aﬀect  the  acquisition  of
phosphorus  by  plants.  Root  exudates  that  are  important  in  the  acquisition  of  nutrients  through
modiﬁcations of the soil environment are topics of research (34), so they are studied for their compo-
sition and their eﬀects on the development of mycorrhizal fungi, chelation of nutrients, solubilization
of  sparingly  soluble  compounds, and  eﬀects  on  soil  acidity, among  other  actions.  Breeding  for
improved soil–plant–microorganism interactions, especially under suboptimal environmental condi-
tions, may lead to genotypes that are improved for nitrogen ﬁxation and promotion of mycorrhizal
symbiosis may bring about increased crop yields under a wide range of environmental conditions.

Bassirirad (35) considered factors of global change, such as increased atmospheric carbon diox-
ide concentrations, higher soil temperatures, and increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition, that
may aﬀect the kinetics of nutrient absorption by roots, noting that the information on the subject
was  scanty  and  that  rigorous  research  was  needed  on  the  topic.  Processes  such  as  transpiration-
driven mass ﬂow, root growth, root exudation, biological nitrogen ﬁxation, and tissue dilution are
all likely to be aﬀected by climate change (36).

Ionomics has been coined as the study of how genes regulate all the ions in a cell (37). This
research is stated to hold promise leading to mineral-eﬃcient plants that might need little fertilizer,
to crops with better nutritional value for humans, and to plants that may remove contamination from
the  soil.  Possibly, a  simple  genetic  change  can  increase  nutrient  absorption  by  green  plants  and
allow crop production under conditions of limited nutrient availability or allow plants to be eﬃcient
in recovery of fertilizer-borne nutrients. Yanagisawa et al. (38) suggested that utilization of tran-
scription factors might lead to modiﬁcation of metabolism of crops, because a single transcription
factor frequently regulates coordinated expression of a set of key genes for several pathways. They
applied the plant-speciﬁc transcription factor (Dof1) to improve nitrogen assimilation, including the
primary assimilation of ammonia to biosynthesize amino acids and other organic compounds con-
taining nitrogen. The authors proposed that similar genetic modiﬁcations could reduce dependence
on nitrogen fertilizers.

22.5 GENERAL REMARKS
Current research on plant nutrition is extensive, and only a few topics can be mentioned here. Some
of  the  topics  mentioned  on  http://www.plantstress.com, which  is  sponsored  by  the  Rockefeller
Foundation, are noted. With the world population increasing fast, and many people suﬀering from
deﬁciencies of essential nutrients, there will be continuing pressure to improve our understanding
of plant mineral nutrition so that we can grow crops that utilize mineral nutrients as eﬃciently as
possible.

Zinc deﬁciency of peaches (

FIGURE 15.1

smaller than normal and the internodes are shorter causing leaves to be closer to each other and thence the
popular names which describes the terminal branches is “little leaf.” (Photograph by J.B. Storey.)

small crinkled leaves that are mottled with yellow. Healthy zinc-sufﬁcient leaves are dark green. Actual zinc
concentration of each leaf is shown in the photograph. (Photograph by J.B. Storey.)
