To the student

Cambridge IGCSE® Biology Third Edition aims to 
provide an up-to-date and comprehensive coverage 
of the Core and Extended curriculum in Biology, 
specifi ed in the current Cambridge International 
Examinations IGCSE® syllabus.

This third edition has been completely restructured 

to align the chapters in the book with the syllabus. 
Each chapter starts with the syllabus statements to 
be covered in that chapter, and ends with a checklist, 
summarising the important points covered. The 
questions included at the end of each chapter are 
intended to test your understanding of the text you 
have just read. If you cannot answer the question 
straightaway, read that section of text again with the 
question in mind. There are past paper examination 
questions at the end of the book.

To help draw attention to the more important 
words, scientifi c terms are printed in bold the fi rst 
time they are used. As you read through the book, 
you will notice three sorts of shaded area in the text.

Questions are highlighted by a box like this.

The accompanying Revision CD-ROM provides 
invaluable exam preparation and practice. We want to 
test your knowledge with interactive multiple choice 
questions that cover both the Core and Extended 
curriculum. These are organised by chapter. 
Together, the textbook and CD-ROM will 

provide you with the information you need for the 
Cambridge IGCSE syllabus. I hope you enjoy using 
them.

I am indebted to Don Mackean for a substantial 

amount of the content of this textbook. Since 1962, 
he has been responsible for writing excellent Biology 
books to support the education of countless students, 
as well as providing an extremely useful source of 
information and inspiration for your teachers and 
their teachers. Don’s diagrams, many of which are 
reproduced in this book, are legendary.

Material highlighted in green is for the Cambridge 
IGCSE Extended curriculum.

Areas highlighted in yellow contain material that 
is not part of the Cambridge IGCSE syllabus. It is 
extension work and will not be examined.

Key defi nitions
Movement is an action by an organism causing a change of 

position or place (see Chapter 14).

Respiration describes the chemical reactions in cells that 

break down nutrient molecules and release energy (see 
Chapter 12).

Sensitivity is the ability to detect and respond to changes in 

the environment (see Chapter 14).

Growth is a permanent increase in size (see Chapter 16).
Reproduction is the processes that make more of the same kind 

of organism (see Chapter 16). Single-celled organisms and 
bacteria may simply keep dividing into two. Multicellular 
plants and animals may reproduce sexually or asexually.

Excretion is the removal from organisms of toxic materials and 

substances in excess of requirements (see Chapter 13).

Nutrition is the taking in of materials for energy, growth and 

development (see Chapters 6 and 7).

All living organisms, whether they are single-
celled or multicellular, plants or animals, show 
the characteristics included in the defi nitions 
above: movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, 
reproduction, excretion and nutrition.

One way of remembering this list of the 

characteristics of living things is by using the 
mnemonic MRS GREN. The letters stand for the 
fi rst letters of the characteristics. 

Mnemonics work by helping to make the material 

you are learning more meaningful. They give a 
structure which is easier to recall later. This structure 
may be a word, or a name (such as MRS GREN) or a 
phrase. For example, ‘Richard of York gave battle in 
vain’ is a popular way of remembering the colours of 
the rainbow in the correct sequence.

Key defi nitions
If you are studying the extended syllabus you need to learn more 
detailed defi nitions of some of the characteristics of living things.

Movement is an action by an organism or part of an organism 

causing a change of position or place. 

  Most single-celled creatures and animals move about as a 
whole. Fungi and plants may make movements with parts 
of their bodies (see Chapter 14).

Respiration describes the chemical reactions in cells that break 

down nutrient molecules and release energy for metabolism. 
Most organisms need oxygen for this (see Chapter 12).

Sensitivity is the ability to detect or sense stimuli in the 

internal or external environment and to make appropriate 
responses (see Chapter 14).

Growth is a permanent increase in size and dry mass by an 

 

increase in cell number or cell size or both (see Chapter 16).
Even bacteria and single-celled creatures show an increase 
in size. Multicellular organisms increase the numbers 
of cells in their bodies, become more complicated and 
change their shape as well as increasing in size (see ‘Sexual 
reproduction in humans’ in Chapter 16).

Excretion is the removal from organisms of the waste products 

 

of metabolism (chemical reactions in cells including 
respiration), toxic materials and substances in excess of 
requirements (see Chapter 13).
Respiration and other chemical changes in the cells 
produce waste products such as carbon dioxide. Living 
organisms expel these substances from their bodies in 
various ways (see Chapter 13).

 

Nutrition is the taking in of materials for energy, growth and 
development. Plants require light, carbon dioxide, water 
and ions. Animals need organic compounds and ions and 
usually need water (see Chapters 6 and 7).
Organisms can take in the materials they need as solid 
food, as animals do, or they can digest them fi rst and 
then absorb them, like fungi do, or they can build them 
up for themselves, like plants do. Animals, using ready-
made organic molecules as their food source, are called 
heterotrophs and form the consumer levels of food chains. 
Photosynthetic plants are called autotrophs and are usually 
the fi rst organisms in food chains (see Chapters 6 and 19).

 1  CharaCteristiCs and ClassifiCation of living organisms

●● Concept and use of a 

classification system

Key definitions
A species is a group of organisms that can reproduce to 

produce fertile offspring.

The binomial system is an internationally agreed system in 
which the scientific name of an organism is made up of 
two parts showing the genus and the species.

You do not need to be a biologist to realise that 
there are millions of different organisms living on 
the Earth, but it takes a biologist to sort them into a 
meaningful order, i.e. to classify them.

There are many possible ways of classifying 

organisms. You could group all aquatic organisms 
together or put all black and white creatures into 
the same group. However, these do not make very 
meaningful groups; a seaweed and a porpoise are 
both aquatic organisms, a magpie and a zebra are 
both black and white; but neither of these pairs has 
much in common apart from being living organisms 
and the latter two being animals. These would be 
artificial systems of classification.

A biologist looks for a natural system of 

classification using important features which are 
shared by as large a group as possible. In some cases 
it is easy. Birds all have wings, beaks and feathers; 
there is rarely any doubt about whether a creature 
is a bird or not. In other cases it is not so easy. As a 
result, biologists change their ideas from time to time 
about how living things should be grouped. New 
groupings are suggested and old ones abandoned.

Species
The smallest natural group of organisms is the species. 
A species can be defined as a group of organisms that 
can reproduce to produce fertile offspring.

Members of a species also often resemble each 
other very closely in appearance, unless humans 
have taken a hand in the breeding programmes. All 
cats belong to the same species but there are wide 
variations in the appearance of different breeds (see 
‘Variation’ in Chapter 18). An American Longhair 
and a Siamese may look very different but they 
have few problems in breeding together. Robins, 
blackbirds and sparrows are three different species 
of bird. Apart from small variations, members of 

2

a species are almost identical in their anatomy, 
physiology and behaviour.

Closely related species are grouped into a genus 
(plural: genera). For example, stoats, weasels and 
polecats are grouped into the genus Mustela.

Binomial nomenclature
Species must be named in such a way that the name is 
recognised all over the world.

‘Cuckoo flower’ and ‘Lady’s smock’ are two 

common names for the same wild plant. If you are 
not aware that these are alternative names this could 
lead to confusion. If the botanical name, Cardamine 
pratensis, is used, however, there is no chance of 
error. The Latin form of the name allows it to be 
used in all the countries of the world irrespective of 
language barriers.

People living in Britain are familiar with the 

appearance of a blackbird – a very common garden 
visitor. The male has jet black plumage, while the 
female is brown. Its scientific name is Turdus merula 
and the adult is about 24 cm long (see Figure 1.1). 
However, someone living in North America would 
describe a blackbird very differently. For example, 
the male of one species, Agelaius phoeniceus, has 
black plumage with red shoulder patches and yellow 
flashes, while the female is speckled brown. It is 
about the size of a sparrow – only about 20 cm long 
(see Figure 1.2). A British scientist could get very 
confused talking to an American scientist about a 
blackbird! Again, the use of the scientific name avoids 
any confusion.

The binomial system of naming species is an 

internationally agreed system in which the scientific 
name of an organism is made up of two parts 
showing the genus and the species. Binomial means 
‘two names’; the first name gives the genus and the 
second gives the species. For example, the stoat and 
weasel are both in the genus Mustela but they are 
different species; the stoat is Mustela erminea and the 
weasel is Mustela nivalis.

The name of the genus (the generic name) is 
always given a capital letter and the name of the 
species (the specific name) always starts with a small 
letter.

Frequently, the specific name is descriptive, for 

example  edulis means ‘edible’, aquatilis means ‘living 
in water’, bulbosus means ‘having a bulb’, serratus 
means ‘having a jagged (serrated) edge’.

If you are studying the extended syllabus you need 
to be able to explain why it is important to classify 
organisms. By classifying organisms it is possible to 
identify those most at risk of extinction. Strategies 
can then be put in place to conserve the threatened 
species. Apart from the fact that we have no right to 
wipe out species forever, the chances are that we will 
deprive ourselves not only of the beauty and diversity 
of species, but also of potential sources of valuable 
products such as drugs. Many of our present-day drugs 
are derived from plants (e.g. quinine and aspirin) and 
there may be many more sources as yet undiscovered. 
We are also likely to deprive the world of genetic 
resources (see ‘Conservation’ in Chapter 21).

By classifying organisms it is also possible to 

understand evolutionary relationships. Vertebrates all 
have the presence of a vertebral column, along with 
a skull protecting a brain, and a pair of jaws (usually 
with teeth). By studying the anatomy of different 
groups of vertebrates it is possible to gain an insight 
into their evolution. 

The skeletons of the front limb of five types of 
vertebrate are shown in Figure 1.3. Although the 
limbs have different functions, such as grasping, 
flying, running and swimming, the arrangement 
and number of the bones is almost the same in all 
five. There is a single top bone (the humerus), with 
a ball and socket joint at one end and a hinge joint 

at the other. It makes a joint with two other bones 
(the radius and ulna) which join to a group of small 
wrist bones. The limb skeleton ends with five groups 
of bones (the hand and fingers), although some of 
these groups are missing in the bird.

The argument for evolution says that, if these 

animals are not related, it seems very odd that such 
a similar limb skeleton should be used to do such 
different things as flying, running and swimming. 
If, on the other hand, all the animals came from 
the same ancestor, the ancestral skeleton could have 
changed by small stages in different ways in each 
group. So we would expect to find that the basic 
pattern of bones was the same in all these animals. 
There are many other examples of this kind of 
evidence among the vertebrate animals. 

Classification is traditionally based on studies of 
morphology (the study of the form, or outward 
appearance, of organisms) and anatomy (the study 
of their internal structure, as revealed by dissection). 
Aristotle was the first known person to attempt to devise 
a system of classification based on morphology and 
anatomy. He placed organisms in a hierarchy according 
to the complexity of their structure and function. 
Indeed, some of his ideas still existed just 200 years ago. 
He separated animals into two groups: those with blood 
and those without, placing invertebrates into the second 
group and vertebrates into the first. However, he was

 1  CharaCteristiCs and ClassifiCation of living organisms

Plants have been classifi ed according to their 
morphology, but appearances can be deceptive. 
The London Plane tree and the British Sycamore 
were considered to be closely related because 
of the similarity in their leaf shape, as shown in 
Figure 1.4. 

Figure 1.4  Leaves of the British Sycamore (left) and London Plane (right)

However, a closer study of the two species exposes 
major differences: leaf insertion (how they are 
arranged on a branch) in London Plane is alternate, 
while it is opposite in the Sycamore. Also, their fruits 
are very different, as shown in Figure 1.5.

not aware that some invertebrates do have a form 
of haemoglobin. Using blood as a common feature 
would put earthworms and humans in the same group! 
Earthworm blood is red: it contains haemoglobin, 
although it is not contained in red blood cells.

The scientifi c name of the London Plane is Platanus 
acerifolia (meaning ‘leaves like an Acer’); that of the 
British Sycamore is Acer pseudoplatanus (‘pseudo’ 
means ‘false’). They do not even belong in the 
same genus.

The use of DNA has revolutionised the process 

of classifi cation. Eukaryotic organisms contain 
chromosomes made up of strings of genes. The 
chemical which forms these genes is called DNA

(which is short for deoxyribonucleic acid). The 
DNA is made up of a sequence of bases, coding for 
amino acids and, therefore, proteins (see Chapters 4 
and 17). Each species has a distinct number of 
chromosomes and a unique sequence of bases in 
its DNA, making it identifiable and distinguishable 
from other species. This helps particularly when 
different species are very similar morphologically (in 
appearance) and anatomically (in internal structure). 

The process of biological classification called 

cladistics involves organisms being grouped together 
according to whether or not they have one or more 
shared unique characteristics derived from the 
group’s last common ancestor, which are not present 
in more distant ancestors. Organisms which share a 
more recent ancestor (and are, therefore, more closely 
related) have DNA base sequences that are more 
similar than those that share only a distant ancestor. 

Concept and use of a classification system

Human and primate evolution is a good example 

of how DNA has been used to clarify a process of 
evolution. Traditional classification of primates (into 
monkeys, apes and humans) was based on their 
anatomy, particularly their bones and teeth. This put 
humans on a separate branch, while grouping the 
other apes together into one family called Pongidae.
However, genetic evidence using DNA provides 

a different insight – humans are more closely 
related to chimpanzees (1.2% difference in the 
genome – the complete set of genetic material of 
the organism) and gorillas (1.6% different) than to 
orang-utans (3.1% different). Also, chimpanzees are 
closer to humans than to gorillas (see Figure 1.6).
Bonobos and chimps are found in Zaire and were 
only identified as different species in 1929. The two 
species share the same percentage difference in the 
genome from humans.

 1  CharaCteristiCs and ClassifiCation of living organisms

●● Features of organisms
All living organisms have certain features in 
common, including the presence of cytoplasm and 
cell membranes, and DNA as genetic material.

All living organisms also contain ribosomes 
in the cytoplasm, floating freely or attached to 
membranes called rough endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). Ribosomes are responsible for protein 
synthesis.

The Whittaker five-kingdom 
scheme
The largest group of organisms recognised by 
biologists is the kingdom. But how many kingdoms 
should there be? Most biologists used to favour 
the adoption of two kingdoms, namely Plants 
and Animals. This, however, caused problems 
in trying to classify fungi, bacteria and single-
celled organisms which do not fit obviously into 
either kingdom. A scheme now favoured by many 
biologists is the Whittaker five-kingdom scheme 
consisting of Animal, Plant, Fungus, Prokaryote 
and Protoctist.

It is still not easy to fit all organisms into 

the five-kingdom scheme. For example, many 
protoctista with chlorophyll (the protophyta) show 
important resemblances to some members of the 
algae, but the algae are classified into the plant 
kingdom. 

Viruses are not included in any kingdom – they 
are not considered to be living organisms because 
they lack cell membranes (made of protein and 
lipid), cytoplasm and ribosomes and do not 
demonstrate the characteristics of living things: they 
do not feed, respire, excrete or grow. Although 
viruses do reproduce, this only happens inside the 
cells of living organisms, using materials provided by 
the host cell. 

This kind of problem will always occur when 
we try to devise rigid classification schemes with 
distinct boundaries between groups. The process 
of evolution would hardly be expected to result 
in a tidy scheme of classification for biologists 
to use.

●● Extension work
As scientists learn more about organisms, 
classification schemes change. Genetic sequencing 
has provided scientists with a different way of 
studying relationships between organisms. The 
three-domain scheme was introduced by Carl 
Woese in 1978 and involves grouping organisms 
using differences in ribosomal RNA structure. 
Under this scheme, organisms are classified into 
three domains and six kingdoms, rather than five. 
The sixth kingdom is created by splitting the 
Prokaryote kingdom into two. The domains are:
1 Archaea: containing ancient prokaryotic organisms 

which do not have a nucleus surrounded 
by a membrane. They have an independent 
evolutionary history to other bacteria and their 
biochemistry is very different to other forms of life.
2 Eubacteria: prokaryotic organisms which do not 

have a nucleus surrounded by a membrane.

3 Eukarya: organisms that have a membrane-bound 
nucleus. This domain is further subdivided into the 
kingdoms Protoctist, Fungus, Plant and Animal.
A summary of the classification schemes proposed 
by scientists is shown in Figure 1.7.

and is illustrated in Figures 1.8–1.11.
The plant kingdom
These are made up of many cells – they are 
multicellular. Plant cells have an outside wall made of 
cellulose. Many of the cells in plant leaves and stems 
contain chloroplasts with photosynthetic pigments, e.g. 
chlorophyll. Plants make their food by photosynthesis.

features of organisms

Crustacea
Marine crustacea are crabs, prawns, lobsters, shrimps 
and barnacles. Freshwater crustacea are water fleas, 
Cyclops, the freshwater shrimp (Gammarus) and the 
water louse (Asellus). Woodlice are land-dwelling 
crustacea. Some of these crustacea are illustrated in 
Figure 1.8 on page 7.

Like all arthropods, crustacea have an 

exoskeleton and jointed legs. They also have two 
pairs of antennae which are sensitive to touch 
and to chemicals, and they have compound eyes. 
Compound eyes are made up of tens or hundreds 
of separate lenses with light-sensitive cells beneath. 
They are able to form a crude image and are very 
sensitive to movement.

Typically, crustacea have a pair of jointed limbs 

on each segment of the body, but those on the 
head segments are modified to form antennae 
or specialised mouth parts for feeding (see 
Figure 1.12).

Arthropods 
The arthropods include the crustacea, insects, 
centipedes and spiders (see Figure 1.8 on page 7). 
The name arthropod means ‘jointed limbs’, and this is 
a feature common to them all. They also have a hard, 
firm external skeleton, called a cuticle, which encloses 
their bodies. Their bodies are segmented and, 
between the segments, there are flexible joints which 
permit movement. In most arthropods, the segments 
are grouped together to form distinct regions, the 
head, thorax and abdomen. Table 1.1 outlines the key 
features of the four classes of arthropod.

Insects
The insects form a very large class of arthropods. 
Bees, butterflies, mosquitoes, houseflies, earwigs, 
greenfly and beetles are just a few of the subgroups in 
this class.

Insects have segmented bodies with a firm 

exoskeleton, three pairs of jointed legs, compound 
eyes and, typically, two pairs of wings. The segments 
are grouped into distinct head, thorax and abdomen 
regions (see Figure 1.13).

Insects differ from crustacea in having wings, only 
one pair of antennae and only three pairs of legs. 
There are no limbs on the abdominal segments.

The insects have very successfully colonised the 

land. One reason for their success is the relative 
impermeability of their cuticles, which prevents 
desiccation even in very hot, dry climates.
Arachnids
These are the spiders, scorpions, mites and ticks. 
Their bodies are divided into two regions, the 
cephalothorax and the abdomen (see Figure 1.14). 
They have four pairs of limbs on the cephalothorax, 
two pedipalps and two chelicerae. The pedipalps

Myriapods
These are millipedes and centipedes. They have a head 
and a segmented body which is not obviously divided 
into thorax and abdomen. There is a pair of legs on 
each body segment but in the millipede the abdominal 
segments are fused in pairs and it looks as if it has two 
pairs of legs per segment (see Figure 1.15).

As the myriapod grows, additional segments are 
formed. The myriapods have one pair of antennae 
and simple eyes. Centipedes are carnivorous; 
millipedes feed on vegetable matter.

Vertebrates
Vertebrates are animals which have a vertebral 
column. The vertebral column is sometimes called 
the spinal column or just the spine and consists of 
a chain of cylindrical bones (vertebrae) joined end 
to end.

Each vertebra carries an arch of bone on its dorsal 

(upper) surface. This arch protects the spinal cord 
(see Chapter 14), which runs most of the length of 
the vertebral column. The front end of the spinal 
cord is expanded to form a brain which is enclosed 
and protected by the skull.

The skull carries a pair of jaws which, in most 

vertebrates, have rows of teeth.

The fi ve classes of vertebrates are fi sh, amphibia, 
reptiles, birds and mammals. Table 1.2 summarises 
the key features of these classes.
Body temperature
Fish, amphibia and reptiles are often referred to as 
‘cold-blooded’. This is a misleading term. A fi sh in a 
tropical lagoon or a lizard basking in the sun will have 
warm blood. The point is that these animals have a 
variable body temperature which, to some extent, 
depends on the temperature of their surroundings. 
Reptiles, for example, may control their temperature 
by moving into sunlight or retreating into shade but 
there is no internal regulatory mechanism.

So-called ‘warm-blooded’ animals, for the most 
part, have a body temperature higher than that of 
their surroundings. The main difference, however, is 
that these temperatures are kept more or less constant 
despite any variation in external temperature. There 
are internal regulatory mechanisms (see Chapter 14) 
which keep the body temperature within narrow 
limits.

It is better to use the terms poikilothermic 

(variable temperature) and homoiothermic (constant 
temperature). However, to simplify the terms, ‘cold 
blooded’ and ‘warm blooded’ will be referred to in 
this section.

The advantage of homoiothermy is that 

an animal’s activity is not dependent on the 
surrounding temperature. A lizard may become 
sluggish if the surrounding temperature falls. 
This could be a disadvantage if the lizard is being 
pursued by a homoiothermic predator whose 
speed and reactions are not affected by low 
temperatures.

features of organisms

Fish
Fish are poikilothermic (cold blooded) vertebrates. 
Many of them have a smooth, streamlined shape 
which offers minimal resistance to the water through 
which they move (see Figure 1.16). Their bodies are 
covered with overlapping scales and they have fi ns 
which play a part in movement. 

Fish breathe by means of fi lamentous gills which 

are protected by a bony plate, the operculum.

Fish reproduce sexually but fertilisation usually 
takes place externally; the female lays eggs and the 
male sheds sperms on them after they have been laid.

Amphibia
Amphibia are poikilothermic (cold blooded) 
vertebrates with four limbs and no scales. The class 
includes frogs, toads and newts. The name, amphibian, 
means ‘double life’ and refers to the fact that the 
organism spends part of its life in water and part on 
the land. In fact, most frogs, toads and newts spend 
much of their time on the land, in moist situations, 
and return to ponds or other water only to lay eggs.

The external features of the common frog are 

shown in Figure 1.17. Figure 1.9 on page 8 shows 
the toad and the newt.

 1  CharaCteristiCs and ClassifiCation of living organisms

from frogs and toads in having a tail. All three groups 
are carnivorous.

Amphibia have four limbs. In frogs and toads, 

the hind feet have a web of skin between the toes. 
This offers a large surface area to thrust against the 
water when the animal is swimming. Newts swim by 
a wriggling, fi sh-like movement of their bodies and 
make less use of their limbs for swimming.

Amphibia have moist skins with a good supply of 
capillaries which can exchange oxygen and carbon 
dioxide with the air or water. They also have lungs 
which can be infl ated by a kind of swallowing action. 
They do not have a diaphragm or ribs.

Frogs and toads migrate to ponds where the 

males and females pair up. The male climbs on the 
female’s back and grips fi rmly with his front legs 
(see Figure 1.18). When the female lays eggs, the 
male simultaneously releases sperms over them. 
Fertilisation, therefore, is external even though the 
frogs are in close contact for the event.

Figure 1.18  Frogs pairing. The male clings to the female’s back and 
releases his sperm as she lays the eggs.
Reptiles
Reptiles are land-living vertebrates. Their skins are 
dry and the outer layer of epidermis forms a pattern 
of scales. This dry, scaly skin resists water loss. Also 
the eggs of most species have a tough, parchment-
like shell. Reptiles, therefore, are not restricted to 
damp habitats, nor do they need water in which 
to breed.

Reptiles are poikilothermic (cold blooded) 

but they can regulate their temperature to some 
extent. They do this by basking in the sun until 
their bodies warm up. When reptiles warm up, 
they can move about rapidly in pursuit of insects 
and other prey.

The reptiles include lizards, snakes, turtles, 
tortoises and crocodiles (see Figure 1.19 and 
Figure 1.9 on page 8).

Figure 1.19  Lacerta (×1.5)

Apart from the snakes, reptiles have four limbs, each 
with fi ve toes. Some species of snake still retain the 
vestiges of limbs and girdles.

Male and female reptiles mate, and sperms 

are passed into the female’s body. The eggs are, 
therefore, fertilised internally before being laid. In 
some species, the female retains the eggs in the body 
until they are ready to hatch.

Birds
Birds are homoiothermic (warm blooded) 
vertebrates.

The vertebral column in the neck is fl exible but 
the rest of the vertebrae are fused to form a rigid 
structure. This is probably an adaptation to fl ight, 
as the powerful wing muscles need a rigid frame to 
work against.

The epidermis over most of the body produces a 
covering of feathers but, on the legs and toes, the 
epidermis forms scales. The feathers are of several 
kinds. The fl uffy down feathers form an insulating 
layer close to the skin; the contour feathers cover 
the body and give the bird its shape and colouration; 
the large quill feathers on the wing are essential for 
fl ight.

Birds have four limbs, but the forelimbs are 

modifi ed to form wings. The feet have four toes with 
claws which help the bird to perch, scratch for seeds 
or capture prey, according to the species.

The upper and lower jaws are extended to form a 

beak which is used for feeding in various ways.

Figure 1.20 shows the main features of a bird.
In birds, fertilisation is internal and the female 

lays hard-shelled eggs in a nest where she 
incubates them.

Mammals
Mammals are homoiothermic (warm blooded) 
vertebrates with four limbs. They differ from birds 
in having hair rather than feathers. Unlike the 
other vertebrates they have a diaphragm which 
plays a part in breathing (see Chapter 11). They 
also have mammary glands and suckle their young 
on milk.

A sample of mammals is shown in Figure 1.9 

on page 8 and Figure 1.21 illustrates some of the 
mammalian features.

Humans are mammals. All mammals give birth 
to fully formed young instead of laying eggs. The 
eggs are fertilised internally and undergo a period of 
development in the uterus (see ‘Sexual reproduction 
in humans’ in Chapter 16).

features of organisms

Figure 1.21  Mammalian features. The furry coat, the external ear 
pinnae and the facial whiskers (vibrissae) are visible mammalian features 
in this gerbil.

The young may be blind and helpless at fi rst, e.g. cats, or 
they may be able to stand up and move about soon after 
birth, e.g. sheep and cows. In either case, the youngster’s 
fi rst food is the milk which it sucks from the mother’s 
teats. The milk is made in the mammary glands and 
contains all the nutrients that the offspring need for the 
fi rst few weeks or months, depending on the species.
As the youngsters get older, they start to feed 
on the same food as the parents. In the case of 
carnivores, the parents bring the food to the young 
until they are able to fend for themselves.

of the plant kingdom, although only two groups 
(ferns and flowering plants) will be tested in the 
examination.

Vascular plants (well-developed xylem and phloem)

Chapter 8). This is the name given to any roots 
which grow directly from the stem rather than from 
other roots.

The stem and leaves have sieve tubes and water-
conducting cells similar to those in the xylem and 
phloem of a flowering plant (see Chapter 8). For 
this reason, the ferns and seed-bearing plants are 
sometimes referred to as vascular plants, because 
they all have vascular bundles or vascular tissue. 
Ferns also have multicellular roots with vascular 
tissue.

The leaves of ferns vary from one species to 
another (see Figure 1.22, and Figure 1.10 on 
page 9), but they are all several cells thick. Most of 
them have an upper and lower epidermis, a layer of 
palisade cells and a spongy mesophyll similar to the 
leaves of a flowering plant.

GENUS

SPECIES
e.g. Ranunculus bulbosus

 Ferns
Ferns are land plants with quite highly 
developed structures. Their stems, leaves and 
roots are very similar to those of the flowering 
plants.

The stem is usually entirely below ground and 

takes the form of a structure called a rhizome. 
In bracken, the rhizome grows horizontally 
below ground, sending up leaves at intervals. The 
roots which grow from the rhizome are called 
adventitious roots (see ‘Transport in plants’ in 

Figure 1.22  Young fern leaves. Ferns do not form buds like those of 
the flowering plants. The midrib and leaflets of the young leaf are tightly 
coiled and unwind as it grows.

Ferns produce gametes but no seeds. The zygote 
gives rise to the fern plant, which then produces 
single-celled spores from numerous sporangia 
(spore capsules) on its leaves. The sporangia are 
formed on the lower side of the leaf but their 
position depends on the species of fern. The 
sporangia are usually arranged in compact groups 
(see Figure 1.23).

In addition to knowing the features used to place 
animals and plants into the appropriate kingdoms, you 
also need to know the main features of the following 
kingdoms: Fungus, Prokaryote and Protoctist.

The fungi kingdom
Most fungi are made up of thread-like hyphae (see 
Figure 1.25), rather than cells, and there are many 
nuclei distributed throughout the cytoplasm in their 
hyphae (see Figure 1.26).

 Flowering plants
Flowering plants reproduce by seeds which are 
formed in fl owers. The seeds are enclosed in an 
ovary. The general structure of fl owering plants 
is described in Chapter 8. Examples are shown 
in Figure 1.11 on page 10. Flowering plants are 
divided into two subclasses: monocotyledons 
and dicotyledons. Monocotyledons (monocots 
for short), are fl owering plants which have only 
one cotyledon in their seeds. Most, but not all, 
monocots also have long, narrow leaves (e.g. 
grasses, daffodils, bluebells) with parallel leaf veins 
(see Figure 1.24(a)).

The dicotyledons (dicots for short), have two 
cotyledons in their seeds. Their leaves are usually 
broad and the leaf veins form a branching network 
(see Figure 1.24(b)).

The key features of monocots and dicots are 

summarised in Table 1.3.

 1  CharaCteristiCs and ClassifiCation of living organisms

The fungi include fairly familiar organisms such as 
mushrooms, toadstools, puffballs and the bracket 
fungi that grow on tree trunks (Figure 1.27). There 
are also the less obvious, but very important, mould 
fungi which grow on stale bread, cheese, fruit or 
other food. Many of the mould fungi live in the soil 
or in dead wood. The yeasts are single-celled fungi 
similar to the moulds in some respects.

Some fungal species are parasites, as is the bracket 

fungus shown in Figure 1.27. They live in other 
organisms, particularly plants, where they cause 
diseases which can affect crop plants, such as the 
mildew shown in Figure 1.28. (See also Chapter 10.)

structures. The mycelium in the trunk will eventually kill the tree.

0.01 mm in length. They can be seen only with the 
higher powers of the microscope.

Their cell walls are made, not of cellulose, but of 

a complex mixture of proteins, sugars and lipids. 
Some bacteria have a slime capsule outside their cell 
wall. Inside the cell wall is the cytoplasm, which may 
contain granules of glycogen, lipid and other food 
reserves (see Figure 1.29).

Each bacterial cell contains a single chromosome, 
consisting of a circular strand of DNA (see Chapter 4 
and ‘Chromosomes, genes and proteins’ in 
Chapter 17). The chromosome is not enclosed in a 
nuclear membrane but is coiled up to occupy part of 
the cell, as shown in Figure 1.30.

Figure 1.28  Mildew on wheat. Most of the hyphae are inside the 
leaves, digesting the cells, but some grow out and produce the powdery 
spores seen here.

The Prokaryote kingdom
These are the bacteria and the blue-green algae. 
They consist of single cells but differ from other 
single-celled organisms because their chromosomes 
are not organised into a nucleus.

 Bacterial structure
Bacteria (singular: bacterium) are very small 
organisms consisting of single cells rarely more than

light areas are coiled DNA strands. There are three of them because the 
bacterium is about to divide twice (see Figure 1.31).
Individual bacteria may be spherical, rod-shaped 
or spiral and some have fi laments, called ﬂ agella, 
projecting from them. The fl agella can fl ick and so 
move the bacterial cell about.

features of organisms

Viruses
There are many different types of virus and they vary 
in their shape and structure. All viruses, however, 
have a central core of RNA or DNA (see Chapter 4) 
surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses have no 
nucleus, cytoplasm, cell organelles or cell membrane, 
though some forms have a membrane outside their 
protein coats.

Virus particles, therefore, are not cells. They do 

not feed, respire, excrete or grow and it is debatable 
whether they can be classed as living organisms. 
Viruses do reproduce, but only inside the cells of living 
organisms, using materials provided by the host cell.

A generalised virus particle is shown in Figure 1.33. 
The nucleic acid core is a coiled single strand of RNA. 
The coat is made up of regularly packed protein units 
called capsomeres each containing many protein 
molecules. The protein coat is called a capsid.

division (see ‘Asexual reproduction’ in Chapter 16 and ‘Mitosis’ in Chapter 17).

The Protoctist kingdom
These are single-celled (unicellular) organisms 
which have their chromosomes enclosed in a nuclear 
membrane to form a nucleus. Some examples are 
shown in Figure 1.32.

Some of the protoctista, e.g. Euglena, possess 

chloroplasts and make their food by photosynthesis. 
These protoctista are often referred to as unicellular 
‘plants’ or protophyta. Organisms such as Amoeba 
and Paramecium take in and digest solid food and 
thus resemble animals in their feeding. They may be 
called unicellular ‘animals’ or protozoa.

Amoeba is a protozoan which moves by a fl owing 

movement of its cytoplasm. It feeds by picking 
up bacteria and other microscopic organisms as it 
goes. Vorticella has a contractile stalk and feeds by 
creating a current of water with its cilia. The current 
brings particles of food to the cell. Euglena and 
Chlamydomonas have chloroplasts in their cells and 
feed, like plants, by photosynthesis.

Outside the capsid, in the influenza virus and some 
other viruses, is an envelope which is probably derived 
from the cell membrane of the host cell (Figure 1.34).
Ideas about classification
From the earliest days, humans must have given 
names to the plants and animals they observed, 
particularly those that were useful as food or medicine. 
Over the years, there have been many attempts to 
sort plants and animals into related groups. Aristotle’s 
‘Ladder of Nature’ (Figure 1.35) organised about 500 
animal species into broad categories.

The 16th-century herbalists, such as John Gerard, 
divided the plant world into ‘kindes’ such as grasses, 
rushes, grains, irises and bulbs. Categories such 
as ‘medicinal plants’ and ‘sweet-smelling plants’, 
however, did not constitute a ‘natural’ classification 
based on structural features. The herbalists also gave 
the plants descriptive Latin names, e.g. Anemone 
tenuifoliaflorecoccinea (‘the  small-leaved scarlet 
anemone’). The first name shows a recognition of 
relationship to Anemone nemorumfloreplenoalbo 
(‘the double white wood anemone’), for example. 
This method of naming was refined and popularised 
by Carl Linnaeus (see below).

John Ray (1625–1705)
Ray was the son of a blacksmith who eventually 
became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He travelled 
widely in Britain and Europe making collections of 
plants, animals and rocks. 

In 1667 and 1682 he published a catalogue of 

British plants based on the structure of their flowers, 
seeds, fruits and roots. He was the first person to 

make a distinction between monocots and dicots. 
Ray also published a classification of animals, based 
on hooves, toes and teeth. Ultimately he devised 
classificatory systems for plants, birds, mammals, fish 
and insects. In doing this, he brought order out of a 
chaos of names and systems.

At the same time he studied functions, adaptations 

and behaviour of organisms.

In 1691 he claimed that fossils were the 

mineralised remains of extinct creatures, possibly 
from a time when the Earth was supposedly covered 
by water. This was quite contrary to established (but 
varied) views on the significance of fossils. Some 
thought that the fossils grew and developed in the 
rocks, others supposed that God had put them there 
‘for his pleasure’ and still others claimed that the 
Devil put them in the rocks to ‘tempt, frighten or 
confuse’. A more plausible theory was that a huge 
flood had washed marine creatures on to the land.

Despite Ray’s declaration, the modern idea of the 

significance of fossils was not generally accepted until 
Darwin’s day (see ‘Selection’ in Chapter 18).

Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778)
Linnaeus was a Swedish naturalist who initially 
graduated in medicine but became interested in 
plants. He travelled in Scandinavia, England and 
Eastern Europe, discovering and naming new plant 
species. 

In 1735 he published his Systema Naturae, which 

accurately described about 7700 plant species 
and classified them, largely on the basis of their 
reproductive structures (stamens, ovaries, etc., see 
‘Sexual reproduction in plants’ in Chapter 16). He 
further grouped species into genera, genera into 
classes, and classes into orders. (‘Phyla’ came later.) 
He also classified over 4000 animals, but rather less 
successfully, into mammals, birds, insects and worms.

Linnaeus refined and popularised the binomial 

system of naming organisms, in which the first 
name represents the genus and the second name 
the species. (See ‘Concept and use of a classification 
system’ earlier in this chapter.) This system is still 
the official starting point for naming or revising the 
names of organisms.

Although the classificatory system must have 

suggested some idea of evolution, Linnaeus 
steadfastly rejected the theory and insisted that no 
species created by God had ever become extinct.

●● Dichotomous keys
Dichotomous keys are used to identify unfamiliar 
organisms. They simplify the process of identification. 
Each key is made up of pairs of contrasting features 
(dichotomous means two branches), starting with quite 
general characteristics and progressing to more specific 
ones. By following the key and making appropriate 
choices it is possible to identify the organism correctly.

Figure 1.36 shows an example of a dichotomous key 

that could be used to place an unknown vertebrate in 
the correct class. Item 1 gives you a choice between 
two alternatives. If the animal is poikilothermic (cold 
blooded), you move to item 2 and make a further 
choice. If it is homoiothermic (warm blooded), you 
move to item 4 for your next choice.

The same technique may be used for assigning 

an organism to its class, genus or species. However, 
the important features may not always be easy to 
see and you have to make use of less fundamental 
characteristics.

Figure 1.36  A dichotomous key for vertebrate classes

Figure 1.37 is a key for identifying some of the possible 
invertebrates to be found in a compost heap. Of course, 
you do not need a key to identify these familiar animals 
but it does show you how a key can be constructed.

You need to be able to develop the skills to 
construct simple dichotomous keys, based on 
easily identifiable features. If you know the main 
characteristics of a group, it is possible to draw 
up a systematic plan for identifying an unfamiliar 
organism. One such plan is shown in Figure 1.38  
(on the next page).

Figure 1.39 (overleaf) shows five different items 
of laboratory glassware. If you were unfamiliar 
with the resources in a science lab you may not 
be able to name them. We are going to create a 
dichotomous key to help with identification. All 
the items have one thing in common – they are 
made of glass. However, each has features which 
make it unique and we can devise questions based 
on these features. The first task is to study the 
items, to work out what some of them have in 
common and what makes them different from 
others. For example, some have a pouring spout, 
others have graduations marked on the glass for 
measuring, some have a neck (where the glass 
narrows to form a thinner structure), some can 
stand without support because they have a flat 
base, and so on. 

The first question should be based on a feature 

which will split the group into two. The question is 
going to generate a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. For each of 
the two sub-groups formed, a further question based 
on the features of some of that sub-group should 
then be formulated. Figure 1.40 (overleaf) shows one 
possible solution.

This is not the only way that a dichotomous 

key could be devised for the laboratory glassware 
shown. Construct your own key and test it for 
each object.

Checklist
After studying Chapter 1 you should know and understand the 
following:

•  The seven characteristics of living things are movement, 

respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion and 
nutrition.

•  A species is a group of organisms that can reproduce to 

produce fertile offspring. 

•  The binomial system is an internationally agreed system in 

which the scientifi c name of an organism is made up of two 
parts showing the genus and the species.

•  Classifi cation is a way of sorting organisms into a 

meaningful order, traditionally using morphology and 
anatomy, but recently also using DNA.

•  All living organisms have certain features in common, 

including the presence of cytoplasm and cell membranes, 
and DNA as genetic material.

•  Animals get their food by eating plants or other animals.
•  Arthropods have a hard exoskeleton and jointed legs.
•  Crustacea mostly live in water and have more than three 

pairs of legs.

•  Insects mostly live on land and have wings and three pairs of 

legs.

•  Arachnids have four pairs of legs and poisonous mouth parts.
•  Myriapods have many pairs of legs.
•  Vertebrates have a spinal column and skull.
•  Fish have gills, fi ns and scales.
•  Amphibia can breathe in air or in water.
•  Reptiles are land animals; they lay eggs with leathery shells.

homoiothermic (warm-blooded).

•  Mammals have fur, they suckle their young and the young 

develop inside the mother.

•  Keys are used to identify unfamiliar organisms. 
•  Dichotomous means two branches, so the user is given a 

choice of two possibilities at each stage.

●● Cell structure and 

organisation

Cell structure
If a very thin slice of a plant stem is cut and studied 
under a microscope, it can be seen that the stem 
consists of thousands of tiny, box-like structures. These 
structures are called cells. Figure 2.1 is a thin slice 
taken from the tip of a plant shoot and photographed 
through a microscope. Photographs like this are called 
photomicrographs. The one in Figure 2.1 is 60 times 
larger than life, so a cell which appears to be 2 mm 
long in the picture is only 0.03 mm long in life.

Thin slices of this kind are called sections. If you 
cut along the length of the structure, you are taking 
a longitudinal section (Figure 2.2(b)). Figure 2.1 
shows a longitudinal section, which passes through 
two small developing leaves near the tip of the 
shoot, and two larger leaves below them. The leaves, 
buds and stem are all made up of cells. If you cut 
across the structure, you make a transverse section 
(Figure 2.2(a)).

(a) transverse section

(b) longitudinal section

Figure 2.2  Cutting sections of a plant stem

It is fairly easy to cut sections through plant 
structures just by using a razor blade. To cut sections 
of animal structures is more diffi cult because they 
are mostly soft and fl exible. Pieces of skin, muscle or 
liver, for example, fi rst have to be soaked in melted 
wax. When the wax goes solid it is then possible to 
cut thin sections. The wax is dissolved away after 
making the section.

When sections of animal structures are examined 

under the microscope, they, too, are seen to be made 
up of cells but they are much smaller than plant cells 
and need to be magnifi ed more. The photomicrograph 
of kidney tissue in Figure 2.3 has been magnifi ed 700 
times to show the cells clearly. The sections are often 
treated with dyes, called stains, in order to make the 
structures inside the cells show up more clearly.

Figure 2.1  Longitudinal section through the tip of a plant shoot (×60). 
The slice is only one cell thick, so light can pass through it and allow the 
cells to be seen clearly.

Cell structure and organisation

In plant cells it may be seen to be fl owing about. The 
particles may be food reserves such as oil droplets 
or granules of starch. Other particles are structures 
known as organelles, which have particular functions 
in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, a great many 
chemical reactions are taking place which keep the 
cell alive by providing energy and making substances 
that the cell needs. 

The liquid part of cytoplasm is about 90% water 

with molecules of salts and sugars dissolved in it. 
Suspended in this solution there are larger molecules 
of fats (lipids) and proteins (see Chapter 4). Lipids 
and proteins may be used to build up the cell 
structures, such as the membranes. Some of the 
proteins are enzymes (see Chapter 5). Enzymes 
control the rate and type of chemical reactions 
which take place in the cells. Some enzymes are 
attached to the membrane systems of the cell, 
whereas others fl oat freely in the liquid part of 
the cytoplasm.
Cell membrane
This is a thin layer of cytoplasm around the outside 
of the cell. It stops the cell contents from escaping 
and also controls the substances which are allowed 
to enter and leave the cell. In general, oxygen, food 
and water are allowed to enter; waste products are 
allowed to leave and harmful substances are kept out. 
In this way the cell membrane maintains the structure 
and chemical reactions of the cytoplasm.
Nucleus (plural: nuclei)
Most cells contain one nucleus, which is usually 
seen as a rounded structure enclosed in a membrane 
and embedded in the cytoplasm. In drawings of 
cells, the nucleus may be shown darker than the 
cytoplasm because, in prepared sections, it takes 
up certain stains more strongly than the cytoplasm. 
The function of the nucleus is to control the 
type and quantity of enzymes produced by the 
cytoplasm. In this way it regulates the chemical 
changes which take place in the cell. As a result, 
the nucleus determines what the cell will be, for 
example, a blood cell, a liver cell, a muscle cell or 
a nerve cell.

The nucleus also controls cell division, as shown 

in Figure 2.5. A cell without a nucleus cannot 
reproduce. Inside the nucleus are thread-like 
structures called chromosomes, which can be seen 
most easily at the time when the cell is dividing (see 
Chapter 17 for a fuller account of chromosomes).

25

8/18/14   9:40 PM

Figure 2.3  Transverse section through a kidney tubule (×700). A section 
through a tube will look like a ring (see Figure 2.14(b)). In this case, each 
‘ring’ consists of about 12 cells.

Making sections is not the only way to study cells. 
Thin strips of plant tissue, only one cell thick, can be 
pulled off stems or leaves (Experiment 1, page 28). 
Plant or animal tissue can be squashed or smeared 
on a microscope slide (Experiment 2, page 29) or 
treated with chemicals to separate the cells before 
studying them.

There is no such thing as a typical plant or animal 

cell because cells vary a great deal in their size and 
shape depending on their function. Nevertheless, it 
is possible to make a drawing like Figure 2.4 to show 
features which are present in most cells. All cells have 
a cell membrane, which is a thin boundary enclosing 
the cytoplasm. Most cells have a nucleus.

Plant cells differ from animal cells in several ways.
1 Outside the cell membrane they all have a cell wall 

which contains cellulose and other compounds. 
It is non-living and allows water and dissolved 
substances to pass through. The cell wall is not 
selective like the cell membrane. (Note that plant 
cells do have a cell membrane but it is not easy to 
see or draw because it is pressed against the inside 
of the cell wall (see Figure 2.7).)

 Under the microscope, plant cells are quite 

distinct and easy to see because of their cell walls. 
In Figure 2.1 it is only the cell walls (and in some 
cases the nuclei) which can be seen. Each plant cell 
has its own cell wall but the boundary between two 
cells side by side does not usually show up clearly. 
Cells next to each other therefore appear to be 
sharing the same cell wall.

2 Most mature plant cells have a large, fl uid-fi lled 
space called a vacuole. The vacuole contains cell 
sap, a watery solution of sugars, salts and sometimes 
pigments. This large, central vacuole pushes the 
cytoplasm aside so that it forms just a thin lining inside 
the cell wall. It is the outward pressure of the vacuole 
on the cytoplasm and cell wall which makes plant cells 
and their tissues fi rm (see ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3). 
Animal cells may sometimes have small vacuoles in 
their cytoplasm but they are usually produced to do a 
particular job and are not permanent.

3 In the cytoplasm of plant cells are many organelles 

called plastids. These are not present in animal 
cells. If they contain the green substance 
chlorophyll, the organelles are called chloroplasts 
(see Chapter 6). Colourless plastids usually contain 
starch, which is used as a food store. (Note: the 
term plastid is not a syllabus requirement.)

remember that, although cells look fl at in sections or in thin strips of 
tissue, they are in fact three-dimensional and may seem to have different 
shapes according to the direction in which the section is cut. If the cell is 
cut across it will look like (b); if cut longitudinally it will look like (a).

The shape of a cell when seen in a transverse section 
may be quite different from when the same cell is 
seen in a longitudinal section and Figure 2.7 shows 

why this is so. Figures 8.4(b) and 8.4(c) on page 112 
show the appearance of cells in a stem vein as seen in 
transverse and longitudinal section.

When studied at much higher magnifications with 
the electron microscope, the cytoplasm of animal 
and plant cells no longer looks like a structureless jelly 
but appears to be organised into a complex system of 
membranes and vacuoles. Organelles present include 
the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a network of 
flattened cavities surrounded by a membrane, which 
links with the nuclear membrane. The membrane holds 
ribosomes, giving its surface a rough appearance. 
Rough endoplasmic reticulum has the function 
of producing, transporting and storing proteins. 
Ribosomes can also be found free in the cytoplasm. 
They build up the cell’s proteins (see Chapter 4). 
Mitochondria are tiny organelles, which may 

appear slipper-shaped, circular or oval when viewed in 
section. In three dimensions, they may be spherical, 
rod-like or elongated. They have an outer membrane 
and an inner membrane with many inward-pointing 
folds. Mitochondria are most numerous in regions 
of rapid chemical activity and are responsible for 
producing energy from food substances through the 
process of aerobic respiration (see Chapter 12).

Note that prokaryotes do not possess mitochondria 

or rough endoplasmic reticulum in their cytoplasm.

Practical work
Looking at cells
1  Plant cells – preparing a slide of onion epidermis cells
The onion provides a very useful source of epidermal plant tissue 
which is one cell thick, making it relatively easy to set up as a 
temporary slide. The onion is made up of fleshy leaves. On the 
incurve of each leaf there is an epidermal layer which can be 
peeled off (Figure 2.9(a)). 

n  Using forceps, peel a piece of epidermal tissue from the 

incurve of an onion bulb leaf. 

n  Place the epidermal tissue on a glass microscope slide. 
n  Using a scalpel, cut out a 1 cm square of tissue (discarding the 

rest) and arrange it in the centre of the slide. 

n  Add two to three drops of iodine solution. (This will stain any 

starch in the cells and provides a contrast between different 
components of the cells.)

n  Using forceps, a mounted needle or a wooden splint, support 
a coverslip with one edge resting near to the onion tissue, at 
an angle of about 45° (Figure 2.9(b)). 

n  Gently lower the coverslip over the onion tissue, trying to 

avoid trapping any air bubbles. (Air bubbles will reflect light 
when viewing under the light microscope, obscuring the 
features you are trying to observe.) 

n  Leave the slide for about 5 minutes to allow the iodine stain 

to react with the specimen. The iodine will stain the cell nuclei 
pale yellow and the starch grains blue. 

n  Place the slide on to the microscope stage, select the lowest 

power objective lens and focus on the specimen. Increase the 
magnification using the other objective lenses. Under high power, 
the cells should look similar to those shown in Figure 2.10.

n  Make a large drawing of one cell and label the following 

parts: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus.

An alternative tissue is rhubarb epidermis (Figure 2.9(c)). This 
can be stripped off from the surface of a stalk and treated in the 
same way as the onion tissue. If red epidermis from rhubarb stalk 
is used, you will see the red cell sap in the vacuoles.

n  Leave the slide for a few minutes to allow the methylene blue 

stain to react with the specimen. 

n  Place the slide on to the microscope stage, select the lowest 

power objective lens and focus on the specimen. Increase 
the magnification using the other objective lenses. Under 
high power, the cells should look similar to those shown in 
Figure 2.12, but less magnified. 

n  Make a large drawing of one cell and label the following 

parts: cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus. 

n  Place your used slide in laboratory disinfectant before washing.

of the space in each cell. The chloroplasts are confined to the layer of 
cytoplasm lining the cell wall.

3  Animal cells – preparing human cheek cells
Human cheek cells are constantly being rubbed off inside the 
mouth as they come in contact with the tongue and food. They 
can therefore be collected easily for use in a temporary slide.

Note: The Department of Education and Science and, 
subsequently, Local Authorities, used to recommend that 
schools should not use the technique which involves studying 
the epithelial cells which appear in a smear taken from the 
inside of the cheek. This was because of the very small risk of 
transmitting the AIDS virus. However, this guidance has now 
changed. A document, Safety in Science Education (1996) by 
the DfEE in Britain states that official government guidance on 
cheek cells has been effectively reversed, indicating that the use 
of cotton buds is now ‘permitted’ together with appropriate 
precautions to treat contaminated items with disinfectant or  
by autoclaving. 

n  Rinse your mouth with water to remove any fragments of food. 
n  Take a cotton bud from a freshly opened pack. Rub the cotton 

bud lightly on the inside of your cheek and gums to collect 
some cheek cells in saliva. 

n  Rub the cotton bud on to the centre of a clean microscope 
slide, to leave a sample of saliva. Repeat if the sample is too 
small. Then drop the cotton bud into a container of absolute 
alcohol or disinfectant. 

n  Add two to three drops of methylene blue dye. (This will stain 

parts of the cheek cells to make nuclei more visible.) 

n  Using forceps, a mounted needle or wooden splint, support a 
coverslip with one edge resting near to the cheek cell sample, 
at an angle of about 45 °. Gently lower the coverslip over the 
tissue, trying to avoid trapping any air bubbles. (Air bubbles 

Figure 2.12  Cells from the lining epithelium of the cheek (×1500)

An alternative method of obtaining cells is to press some 
transparent sticky tape on to a well-washed wrist. When the tape 
is removed and studied under the microscope, cells with nuclei 
can be seen. A few drops of methylene blue solution will stain 
the cells and make the nuclei more distinct.

●● Levels of organisation
Specialisation of cells
Most cells, when they have finished dividing and 
growing, become specialised. When cells are specialised:
●  they do one particular job
●  they develop a distinct shape
●  special kinds of chemical change take place in their 

cytoplasm. 

The changes in shape and the chemical reactions 
enable the cell to carry out its special function. Red 
blood cells and root hair cells are just two examples 
of specialised cells. Figure 2.13 shows a variety of 
specialised cells.

The specialisation of cells to carry out particular 

functions in an organism is sometimes referred to as 
‘division of labour’ within the organism. Similarly,

 These cells transport mineral ions from the roots to the leaves. A

the cells very strong and impermeable. This gives the stem strength. The 
lignin forms distinctive patterns in the vessels – spirals, ladder shapes, 
reticulate (net-like) and pitted. Xylem vessels are made up of a series of 
long xylem cells joined end-to-end (Figure 8.4(a)). Once a region of the 
plant has stopped growing, the end walls of the cells are digested away 
to form a continuous, fi ne tube (Figure 8.4(c)). The lignin thickening 
prevents the free passage of water and nutrients, so the cytoplasm in the 
cells dies. Effectively, the cells form long, thin, strong straws.

Tissues and organs
There are some microscopic organisms that consist 
of one cell only (see ‘Features of organisms’ in 
Chapter 1). These can carry out all the processes 
necessary for their survival. The cells of the larger 

Levels of organisation

plants and animals cannot survive on their own. A 
muscle cell could not obtain its own food and oxygen. 
Other specialised cells have to provide the food and 
oxygen needed for the muscle cell to live. Unless 
these cells are grouped together in large numbers and 
made to work together, they cannot exist for long.

Tissues
A tissue, such as bone, nerve or muscle in animals, 
and epidermis, xylem or pith in plants, is made up 
of many hundreds of cells often of a single type. 
The cells of each type have a similar structure and 
function so that the tissue itself can be said to have 
a particular function; for example, muscles contract 
to cause movement, xylem carries water in plants. 
Figure 2.14 shows how some cells are arranged to 
form simple tissues.

Key deﬁ nition
A tissue is a group of cells with similar structures, working 

together to perform a shared function.

Organs
Organs consist of several tissues grouped together to 
make a structure with a special function. For example, 
the stomach is an organ which contains tissues made 
from epithelial cells, gland cells and muscle cells. 
These cells are supplied with food and oxygen brought 
by blood vessels. The stomach also has a nerve supply. 
The heart, lungs, intestines, brain and eyes are further 
examples of organs in animals. In fl owering plants, the 
root, stem and leaves are the organs. The tissues of the 
leaf include epidermis, palisade tissue, spongy tissue, 
xylem and phloem (see Chapter 8).

Key deﬁ nition
An organ is a structure made up of a group of tissues, working 

together to perform a specifi c function.

Organ systems
An organ system usually refers to a group of organs 
whose functions are closely related. For example, 
the heart and blood vessels make up the circulatory 
system; the brain, spinal cord and nerves make up 
the nervous system (Figure 2.15). In a fl owering 
plant, the stem, leaves and buds make up a system 
called the shoot (Figure 8.1 on page 110).

working together to perform a body function.

●● Size of specimens
The light microscope 
Most cells cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
A hand lens has a magnification of up to ×20, 
but this is not sufficient to observe the detail in 
cells. The light microscope (Figure 2.17) has 
two convex lenses, providing magnifications of 
up to ×1500, although most found in school 
laboratories will only magnify to ×400. The 
eyepiece lens is usually ×10 and there is a choice of 
objective lenses (typically ×4, ×10 and ×40), set in 
a nosepiece which can be rotated. Light, provided 
by a mirror or a bulb, is projected through the 
specimen mounted on a microscope slide. It passes 
through the objective and eyepieces lenses and the 
image is magnified so that detail of the specimen 
can be seen. Coarse and fine focus knobs are used 
to sharpen the image. Specimens are mounted 
on microscope slides, which may be temporary 
or permanent preparations. Temporary slides are 

quick to prepare, but the specimens dry out quite 
rapidly, so they cannot be stored successfully. A 
coverslip (a thin piece of glass) is carefully laid 
over the specimen. This helps to keep it in place, 
slows down dehydration and protects the objective 
lens from moisture or stains. A permanent 
preparation usually involves dehydrating the 
specimen and fixing it in a special resin such as 
Canada Balsam. These types of slides can be kept 
for many years. 

Calculating magnification
A lens is usually marked with its magnifying power. 
This indicates how much larger the image will be, 
compared to the specimen’s actual size. So, if the lens 
is marked ×10, the image will be ten times greater 
than the specimen’s real size. Since a light microscope 
has two lenses, the magnification of both of these 
lenses needs to be taken into account. For example, 
if the specimen is viewed using a ×10 eyepiece lens 
and ×40 objective lens, the total magnification will be 
10 × 40 = 400.

Organelles in cells are too small to be measured in 
millimetres. A smaller unit, called the micrometre 
(micron or µm) is used. Figure 2.18 shows a 
comparison of the sizes of a range of objects. The 

scale is in nanometres because of the tiny size of 
some of the objects. There are 1000 nanometres in

The importance of active transport to the uptake of glucose

Cells need food materials which they can oxidise 
for energy or use to build up their cell structures. 
They also need salts and water, which play a part in 
chemical reactions in the cell. Finally, they need to 
get rid of substances such as carbon dioxide, which, if 
they accumulated in the cell, would upset some of the 
chemical reactions or even poison the cell.

Substances may pass through the cell membrane 

either passively by diffusion or actively by some form 
of active transport.

●● Diffusion
Key defi nition
Diffusion is the net movement of molecules and ions from a 
region of their higher concentration to a region of their 
lower concentration down a concentration gradient, as a 
result of their random movement.

The molecules of a gas such as oxygen are moving 
about all the time. So are the molecules of a liquid or 
a substance such as sugar dissolved in water. As a result 
of this movement, the molecules spread themselves 
out evenly to fi ll all the available space (Figure 3.1).

molecules moving about

become evenly distributed

Figure 3.1  Diffusion
This process is called diffusion. One effect of 
diffusion is that the molecules of a gas, a liquid or a 
dissolved substance will move from a region where 
there are a lot of them (i.e. concentrated) to regions 
where there are few of them (i.e. less concentrated) 

36

until the concentration everywhere is the same. 
Figure 3.2(a) is a diagram of a cell with a high 
concentration of molecules (e.g. oxygen) outside 
and a low concentration inside. The effect of this 
difference in concentration is to make the molecules 
diffuse into the cell until the concentration inside and 
outside is the same, as shown in Figure 3.2(b).

(a) greater concentration

outside cell

(b) concentrations equal on both

sides of the cell membrane

Figure 3.2  Molecules entering a cell by diffusion

Whether this will happen or not depends on whether 
the cell membrane will let the molecules through. 
Small molecules such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide 
(CO2) and oxygen (O2) can pass through the cell 
membrane fairly easily. So diffusion tends to equalise 
the concentration of these molecules inside and 
outside the cell all the time.

When a cell uses oxygen for its aerobic respiration, 

the concentration of oxygen inside the cell falls 
and so oxygen molecules diffuse into the cell until 
the concentration is raised again. During tissue 
respiration, carbon dioxide is produced and so its 
concentration inside the cell increases. Once again 
diffusion takes place, but this time the molecules 
move out of the cell. In this way, diffusion can 
explain how a cell takes in its oxygen and gets rid of 
its carbon dioxide.

The importance of diffusion of gases 
and solutes

Gases
Most living things require a reliable source of oxygen 
for respiration. This moves into the organism by 
diffusion down a concentration gradient. Small 
animals with a large surface area to volume ratio may 
obtain oxygen through their body surface. Larger 
animals rely on gas exchange organs such as lungs 
or gills, which provide a large surface area for gas 
exchange, and a circulatory system to transport the 
oxygen to all their cells. Carbon dioxide, produced 
during aerobic respiration, is potentially toxic if it 
builds up. It is removed using the same mechanisms, 
again by diffusion.

Photosynthetic plants need carbon dioxide for 

making their food. This diffuses through the stomata 
in the leaves (see Chapter 8) into the air spaces in 
the mesophyll, eventually reaching the palisade cells. 
Oxygen, produced during photosynthesis, along 
with water vapour from the transpiration stream, 
diffuses out of the leaf through the stomata. The 
rate of diffusion of water vapour depends on the 
temperature, humidity and wind speed (see ‘Water 
uptake’ in Chapter 8). Any oxygen needed for 
respiration (some is generated by photosynthesis) 
and carbon dioxide produced (some is used up by 
photosynthesis) also diffuses through the stomata of 
the leaves.

Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the 

atmosphere. (78% of the air is nitrogen.) Nitrogen 
gas also enters the bloodstream by diffusion, but it 
is not used by the body. It is an inert (unreactive) 

Diffusion

gas so, under normal circumstances, it causes no 
problems. However, divers are at risk. As a diver 
swims deeper, the surrounding water pressure 
increases and this in turns raises the pressure in the 
diver’s air tank. An increase in nitrogen pressure in 
the air tank results in more nitrogen diffusing into 
the diver’s tissues, the amount going up the longer 
the diver stays at depth. Nitrogen is not used by 
the body tissues, so it builds up. When the diver 
begins to return to the surface of the water, the 
pressure decreases and the nitrogen can come out 
of solution, forming bubbles in the blood if the 
diver ascends too quickly. These bubbles can block 
blood flow and become lodged in joints resulting 
in a condition called decompression sickness, 
or ‘the bends’. Unless the diver rises slowly in 
planned stages, the effect of the nitrogen bubbles is 
potentially lethal and can only be overcome by rapid 
recompression. 

Solutes 
Mineral ions in solution, such as nitrates and 
magnesium, are thought to diffuse across the tissues 
of plant roots, but most are absorbed into the roots 
by active transport. 

In the ileum, water-soluble vitamins such as 
vitamin B and vitamin C are absorbed into the 
bloodstream by diffusion. 

In the kidneys, some solutes in the renal capsule, 

such as urea and salts, pass back into the bloodstream 
by diffusion. Initially, glucose is reabsorbed by 
diffusion, but active transport is also involved. 
Dialysis machines (see Chapter 13) use diffusion to 
remove small solutes (urea, uric acid and excess salts) 
from the blood.

 Rates of diffusion
Molecules and ions in liquids and gases move 
around randomly using kinetic energy (energy 
from movement). The speed with which a substance 
diffuses through a cell wall or cell membrane will 
depend on temperature and many other conditions 
including the distance it has to diffuse, the difference 
between its concentration inside and outside the cell, 
the size of its molecules or ions and the surface area 
across which the diffusion is occurring.

 Surface area
If 100 molecules diffuse through 1 mm2 of a 
membrane in 1 minute, it is reasonable to suppose 
that an area of 2 mm2 will allow twice as many 
through in the same time. Thus the rate of diffusion 
into a cell will depend on the cell’s surface area. 
The greater the surface area, the faster is the 
total diffusion. Cells which are involved in rapid 
absorption, such as those in the kidney or the 
intestine, often have their ‘free’ surface membrane

formed into hundreds of tiny projections called 
microvilli (see Figure 3.3) which increase the 
absorbing surface.
microvilli

‘free’ (absorbing) surface

Figure 3.3  Microvilli
The shape of a cell will also affect the surface area. 
For example, the cell in Figure 3.4(a) has a greater 
surface area than that in Figure 3.4(b), even though 
they each have the same volume.

(a)

(b)

Figure 3.4  Surface area. The cells both have the same 
volume but the cell in (a) has a much greater surface area.

 Temperature 
An increase in temperature causes an increase in the 
kinetic energy which molecules and ions possess. 
This enables them to move faster, so the process of 
diffusion speeds up. 

 Concentration gradient
The bigger the difference in the concentration 
of a substance on either side of a membrane, 
the faster it will tend to diffuse. The difference 
is called a concentration gradient or diffusion 
gradient (Figure 3.5). If a substance on one side 
of a membrane is steadily removed, the diffusion 
gradient is maintained. When oxygen molecules 
enter a red blood cell they combine with a chemical 
(haemoglobin) which takes them out of solution. 
Thus the concentration of free oxygen molecules 
inside the cell is kept very low and the diffusion 
gradient for oxygen is maintained.

 Distance
Cell membranes are all about the same thickness 
(approximately 0.007 µm) but plant cell walls vary in 
their thickness and permeability. Generally speaking, 
the thicker the wall, the slower the rate of diffusion. 
When oxygen diffuses from the alveoli of the lungs 
into red blood cells, it has to travel through the cell 
membranes of the alveoli, the blood capillaries and 
the red blood cells in addition to the cytoplasm of 
each cell. This increased distance slows down the 
diffusion rate.

 Size of molecules or ions
In general, the larger the molecules or ions, the 
slower they diffuse. However, many ions and 
molecules in solution attract water molecules around 
them (see p. 43) and so their effective size is greatly 
increased. It may not be possible to predict the rate 
of diffusion from the molecular size alone.
 Controlled diffusion
Although for any one substance, the rate of diffusion 
through a cell membrane depends partly on the 
concentration gradient, the rate is often faster or 
slower than expected. Water diffuses more slowly and 
amino acids diffuse more rapidly through a membrane 
than might be expected. In some cases this is thought 
to happen because the ions or molecules can pass 
through the membrane only by means of special 
pores. These pores may be few in number or they may 
be open or closed in different conditions.

In other cases, the movement of a substance 

may be speeded up by an enzyme working in the 
cell membrane. So it seems that ‘simple passive’ 
diffusion, even of water molecules, may not be so 
simple or so passive after all where cell membranes 
are concerned.

When a molecule gets inside a cell there are a 

great many structures and processes which may move 
it from where it enters to where it is needed. Simple 
diffusion is unlikely to play a very signifi cant part in 
this movement.

Experiments on diffusion
1  Diffusion and surface area

n  Use a block of starch agar or gelatine at least 3 cm thick. 

Using a ruler and a sharp knife, measure and cut four cubes

from the jelly with sides of 3.0 cm, 2.0 cm, 1.0 cm and 
0.5 cm. 

n  Place the cubes into a beaker of methylene blue dye or 

potassium permanganate solution. 

n  After 15 minutes, remove the cubes with forceps and place 

them on to a white tile. 

n  Cut each of the cubes in half and measure the depth to which 

the dye has diffused. 

n  Calculate the surface area and volume of each cube and 

construct a table of your data. Remember to state the units in 
the heading for each column.

Question
Imagine that these cubes were animals, with the jelly 
representing living cells and the dye representing oxygen. 
Which of the ‘animals’ would be able to survive by relying 
on diffusion through their surface to provide them with 
oxygen?

Taking it further 
Try cutting different shapes, for example cutting a block 3.0 cm 
long, 1.0 cm wide and 0.5 cm deep. What type of animal would 
this represent? (Refer to Figure 1.7 on page 6.) Research how 
this type of animal obtains its oxygen.

2  Diffusion and temperature

n  Set up two beakers with equal volumes of hot water and iced 

water. 

n  Add a few grains of potassium permanganate to each beaker 

and observe how rapidly the dissolved dye spreads through 
each column of water. An alternative is to use tea bags.

Question
Give an explanation for the results you observed.

3   Diffusion and concentration gradients and 

 distance

n  Push squares of wetted red litmus paper with a glass rod 
or wire into a wide glass tube which is at least 30 cm long 
and corked at one end, so that they stick to the side and 
are evenly spaced out, as shown in Figure 3.6. (It is a good 
strategy to mark 2 cm intervals along the outside of the 
tube, starting at 10 cm from one end, with a permanent 
marker or white correction fluid before inserting the litmus 
paper.)

n  Close the open end of the tube with a cork carrying a plug 

of cotton wool saturated with a strong solution of ammonia. 
Start a stop watch. 

n  Observe and record the time when each square of litmus 

starts to turn blue in order to determine the rate at which the 
alkaline ammonia vapour diffuses along the tube.

n  Repeat the experiment using a dilute solution of ammonia. 
n  Plot both sets of results on a graph, labelling each  

plot line.

4  Diffusion and particle size

n  Take a 15 cm length of dialysis tubing which has been soaked 

in water and tie a knot tightly at one end. 

n  Use a dropping pipette to partly fill the tubing with a mixture 

of 1% starch solution and 1% glucose solution. 

n  Rinse the tubing and test-tube under the tap to remove all 

traces of starch and glucose solution from the outside of the 
dialysis tubing.

n  Put the tubing in a boiling tube and hold it in place with an 

elastic band as shown in Figure 3.7. 

n  Fill the boiling tube with water and leave for 30 minutes.
n  Use separate teat pipettes to remove samples of liquid from 

the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. Test both samples 
with iodine solution and Benedict’s reagent.

Result
The liquid inside the dialysis tubing goes blue with iodine 
solution and may give a positive Benedict’s test, but the sample 
from the boiling tube only gives a positive Benedict’s test.

Interpretation
The blue colour is characteristic of the reaction which takes 
place between starch and iodine, and is used as a test for 
starch. A positive Benedict’s test gives a colour change from 
blue to cloudy green, yellow or brick red (see Chapter 4). The 
results show that glucose molecules have passed through the 
dialysis tubing into the water but the starch molecules have not 
moved out of the dialysis tubing. This is what we would expect 
if the dialysis tubing was partially permeable on the basis of its 
pore size. Starch molecules are very large (see Chapter 4) and 
probably cannot get through the pores. Glucose molecules are 
much smaller and can, therefore, get through.

●● Osmosis
If a dilute solution is separated from a concentrated 
solution by a partially permeable membrane, water 
diffuses across the membrane from the dilute to the 
concentrated solution. This is known as osmosis and 
is shown in Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.8  Osmosis. Water will diffuse from the dilute solution to the 
concentrated solution through the partially permeable membrane. As a 
result, the liquid level will rise on the left and fall on the right.

A partially permeable membrane is porous but allows 
water to pass through more rapidly than dissolved 
substances.

Since a dilute solution contains, in effect, more 

water molecules than a concentrated solution, there is 
a diffusion gradient which favours the passage of water 
from the dilute solution to the concentrated solution.

In living cells, the cell membrane is partially 

permeable and the cytoplasm and vacuole (in plant 
cells) contain dissolved substances. As a consequence, 
water tends to diffuse into cells by osmosis if they are 
surrounded by a weak solution, e.g. fresh water. If 
the cells are surrounded by a stronger solution, e.g. 
sea water, the cells may lose water by osmosis. These 
effects are described more fully later.

Animal cells
In Figure 3.9 an animal cell is shown very simply. The 
coloured circles represent molecules in the cytoplasm. 
They may be sugar, salt or protein molecules. The 
blue circles represent water molecules.

The cell is shown surrounded by pure water. 
Nothing is dissolved in the water; it has 100% 
concentration of water molecules. So the 
concentration of free water molecules outside the cell 
is greater than that inside and, therefore, water will 
diffuse into the cell by osmosis.

The membrane allows water to go through either 
way. So in our example, water can move into or out 
of the cell.

The cell membrane is partially permeable to 

most of the substances dissolved in the cytoplasm. 
So although the concentration of these substances 
inside may be high, they cannot diffuse freely out of 
the cell.

The water molecules move into and out of the cell, 

but because there are more of them on the outside, 
they will move in faster than they move out. The 
liquid outside the cell does not have to be 100% pure 
water. As long as the concentration of water outside 
is higher than that inside, water will diffuse in by 
osmosis.

(a) There is a higher

concentration of free water
molecules outside the cell
than inside, so water diffuses
into the cell.

Figure 3.9  Osmosis in an animal cell

(b) The extra water makes the

cell swell up.

Water entering the cell will make it swell up and, 
unless the extra water is expelled in some way, the cell 
will burst.

Conversely, if the cells are surrounded by a solution 

which is more concentrated than the cytoplasm, 
water will pass out of the cell by osmosis and the 
cell will shrink. Excessive uptake or loss of water by 
osmosis may damage cells.

Osmosis

corresponds to the vacuole. If enough air is pumped 
in, it pushes the inner tube against the tyre and makes 
the tyre hard. 

When plant cells have absorbed a maximum 

amount of water by osmosis, they become very rigid, 
due to the pressure of water pressing outwards on 
the cell wall. The end result is that the stems and 
leaves are supported. If the cells lose water there is no 
longer any water pressure pressing outwards against 
the cell walls and the stems and leaves are no longer 
supported. At this point, the plant becomes limp and 
wilts (see Figure 3.11).

Practical work

Experiments on osmosis
Some of the experiments use ‘Visking’ dialysis tubing. It is 
made from cellulose and is partially permeable, allowing water 
molecules to diffuse through freely, but restricting the passage 
of dissolved substances to varying extents. It is used in kidney 
dialysis machines because it lets the small molecules of harmful 
waste products, such as urea, out of the blood but retains the 
blood cells and large protein molecules (Chapter 13).

For this reason, it is very important that the cells 

in an animal’s body are surrounded by a liquid which 
has the same concentration as the liquid inside the 
cells. The liquid outside the cells is called tissue fluid 
(see ‘Blood and lymphatic vessels’ in Chapter 9) and 
its concentration depends on the concentration of 
the blood. In vertebrates, the concentration of the 
blood is monitored by the brain and adjusted by the 
kidneys, as described in Chapter 13.

By keeping the blood concentration within 

narrow limits, the concentration of the tissue fluid 
remains more or less constant (see ‘Homeostasis’ in 
Chapter 14) and the cells are not bloated by taking in 
too much water or dehydrated by losing too much.
Plant cells
The cytoplasm of a plant cell and the cell sap in its 
vacuole contain salts, sugars and proteins which 
effectively reduce the concentration of free water 
molecules inside the cell. The cell wall is freely 
permeable to water and dissolved substances but 
the cell membrane of the cytoplasm is partially 
permeable. If a plant cell is surrounded by water or 
a solution more dilute than its contents, water will 
pass into the vacuole by osmosis. The vacuole will 
expand and press outwards on the cytoplasm and cell 
wall. The cell wall of a mature plant cell cannot be 
stretched, so there comes a time when the inflow of 
water is resisted by the inelastic cell wall, as shown in 
Figure 3.10.

n  Place 3 cm3 of a strong sugar solution in the tubing using a

n  Fit the tubing over the end of a length of capillary tubing and

Interpretation
Water must be passing into the sugar solution from the beaker. 
This is what you would expect when a concentrated solution is 
separated from water by a partially permeable membrane. 
A process similar to this might be partially responsible for 

moving water from the roots to the stem of a plant.

2   The effects of water and sugar solution on potato 

tissue

n  Push a No.4 or No.5 cork borer into a large potato.
  Caution: Do not hold the potato in your hand but use a board 

as in Figure 3.13(a).

n  Push the potato tissue out of the cork borer using a pencil 

as in Figure 3.13(b). Prepare a number of potato cylinders in 
this way and choose the two longest. (They should be at least 
50 mm long.) Cut these two accurately to the same length, 
e.g. 50, 60 or 70 mm. Measure carefully.

n  Label two test-tubes A and B and place a potato cylinder in 

each. Cover the potato tissue in tube A with water; cover the 
tissue in B with a 20% sugar solution. 

(b) push the potato cylinder out with apencil

Figure 3.13  Obtaining cylinders of potato tissue

Result
The cylinder from tube A should have gained a millimetre or two 
and feel firm. The cylinder from tube B should be a millimetre or 
two shorter and feel flabby.

Interpretation
The cells of the potato in tube A have absorbed water by 
osmosis, causing an increase in the length of the potato 
cylinder.

In tube B, the sugar solution is stronger than the cell sap of the 
potato cells, so these cells have lost water by osmosis, resulting in 
the potato cylinder becoming flabby and shorter.

An alternative to measuring the potato cores is to weigh them 

before and after the 24 hours’ immersion in water or sugar 
solution. The core in tube A should gain weight and that in 
tube B should lose weight. It is important to blot the cores dry 
with a paper towel before weighing them.

Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to pool the results 
of the whole class since the changes may be quite small. A gain 
in length of 1 or 2 mm might be due to an error in measurement, 
but if most of the class record an increase in length, then 
experimental error is unlikely to be the cause.

Key definition
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a 

region of higher water potential (a dilute solution) to a 
region of lower water potential (a concentrated solution) 
through a partially permeable membrane.

sugar molecules pass

Osmosis

How osmosis works
When a substance such as sugar dissolves in water, the 
sugar molecules attract some of the water molecules 
and stop them moving freely. This, in effect, reduces 
the concentration of water molecules. In Figure 3.14 
the sugar molecules on the right have ‘captured’ 
half the water molecules. There are more free water 
molecules on the left of the membrane than on the 
right, so water will diffuse more rapidly from left to 
right across the membrane than from right to left.

The partially permeable membrane does not act like 

a sieve in this case. The sugar molecules can diffuse 
from right to left but, because they are bigger and 
surrounded by a cloud of water molecules, they diffuse 
more slowly than the water, as shown in Figure 3.15.

Artificial partially permeable membranes are made 

from cellulose acetate in sheets or tubes and used 
for dialysis. The pore size can be adjusted during 
manufacture so that large molecules cannot get 
through at all.

The cell membrane behaves like a partially 
permeable membrane. The partial permeability 
may depend on pores in the cell membrane but the 
processes involved are far more complicated than in an 
artificial membrane and depend on the structure of the 
membrane and on living processes in the cytoplasm. 
The cell membrane contains lipids and proteins. 
Anything which denatures proteins, for example, heat, 
also destroys the structure and the partially permeable 
properties of a cell membrane. If this happens, the cell 
will die as essential substances diffuse out of the cell 
and harmful chemicals diffuse in.

Water potential
The water potential of a solution is a measure of 
whether it is likely to lose or gain water molecules 
from another solution. A dilute solution, with its 
high proportion of free water molecules, is said to 
have a higher water potential than a concentrated 
solution, because water will flow from the dilute to 
the concentrated solution (from a high potential to 
a low potential). Pure water has the highest possible 
water potential because water molecules will flow 
from it to any other aqueous solution, no matter 
how dilute. When adjacent cells contain sap with 
different water potentials, a water potential gradient 
is created. Water will move from a cell with a higher 
water potential (a more dilute solution) to a cell 
with a lower water potential (a more concentrated 
solution). This is thought to be one way in which 
water moves from root hair cells through to the 
xylem of a plant root (see Figure 8.11 on page 115).

The importance of water potential 
and osmosis in the uptake of 
water by plants
A plant cell with the vacuole pushing out on the cell 
wall is said to be turgid and the vacuole is exerting 
turgor pressure on the inelastic cell wall.

If all the cells in a leaf and stem are turgid, the 

stem will be firm and upright and the leaves held out 
straight. If the vacuoles lose water for any reason, the 

43

 3  MOveMent in anD Out Of cells

cells will lose their turgor and become flaccid. (See 
Experiment 4 ‘Plasmolysis’ on page 46.) If a plant 
has flaccid cells, the leaves will be limp and the stem 
will droop. A plant which loses water to this extent is 
said to be ‘wilting’ (see Figure 3.11). 

Root hair cells are in contact with water trapped 

between soil particles. When the water potential 
of the cell sap is lower than that of the soil water, 
the water will enter the cells by osmosis providing 
the plant with the water it needs. (This process 
is described in more detail in ‘Water uptake’ in 
Chapter 8.)

When a farmer applies chemical fertilisers to the 

soil, the fertilisers dissolve in the soil water. Too 
much fertiliser can lower the osmotic potential of the 
soil water. This can draw water out of the plant root 
hair cells by osmosis, leading to wilting and death of 
crop plants. 

Irrigation of crops can have a similar effect. 

Irrigation which provides just enough water for the 
plant can lead to a build-up of salts in the soil. The 
salts will eventually cause the soil water to have a lower 
water potential than the plant root cells. Crops can 
then no longer be grown on the land, because they 
wilt and die because of water loss by osmosis. Much 
agricultural land in hot countries has become unusable 
due to the side-effects of irrigation (Figure 3.16).

Figure 3.16  An irrigation furrow

Some countries apply salt to roads in the winter 
to prevent the formation of ice (Figure 3.17). 
However, vehicle wheels splash the salt on to plants 
at the side of the road. The build-up of salts in the 
roadside soil can kill plants living there, due to water 
loss from the roots by osmosis.

44

Figure 3.17  Salt gritter at work to prevent ice formation on a road

The importance of water potential 
and osmosis in animal cells and 
tissues
It is vital that the fluid which bathes cells in 
animals, such as tissue fluid or blood plasma, has 
the same water potential as the cell contents. 
This prevents any net flow of water into or out of 
the cells. If the bathing fluid has a higher water 
potential (a weaker concentration) than the cells, 
water will move into the cells by osmosis causing 
them to swell up. As animal cells have no cell wall 
and the membrane has little strength, water would 
continue to enter and the cells will eventually 
burst (a process called haemolysis in red blood 
cells). Single-celled animals such as Amoeba (see 
Figure 1.32 on page 19) living in fresh water 
obviously have a problem. They avoid bursting by 
possessing a contractile vacuole. This collects the 
water as it enters the cell and periodically releases 
it through the cell membrane, effectively baling 
the cell out. When surgeons carry out operations 
on a patient’s internal organs, they sometimes 
need to rinse a wound. Pure water cannot be used 
as this would enter any cells it came into contact 
with and cause them to burst. A saline solution, 
with the same water potential as tissue fluid, has to 
be used.

In England in 1995, a teenager called Leah Betts 

(Figure 3.18) collapsed after taking an Ecstasy tablet. 
One of the side-effects of taking Ecstasy is that the 
brain thinks the body is dehydrating so the person 
becomes very thirsty. Leah drank far too much water: 
over 7 litres (12 pints) in 90 minutes. Her kidneys 
could not cope and the extra water in her system 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_3.indd   44

8/18/14   9:41 PM

diluted her blood. Her brain cells took in water by 
osmosis, causing them to swell up and burst. She 
died hours later.

Osmosis

Figure 3.18  Poster campaign featuring Leah Betts to raise awareness 
of the dangers of taking the drug ecstasy.

Diarrhoea is the loss of watery faeces. It is caused 
when water cannot be absorbed from the contents 
of the large intestine, or when extra water is secreted 
into the large intestine due to a viral or bacterial 
infection. For example, the cholera bacterium 
produces a toxin (poison) that causes the secretion 
of chloride ions into the small intestine. This lowers 
the water potential of the gut contents, so water is 
drawn into the intestine by osmosis. The result is the 
production of watery faeces. Unless the condition is 
treated, dehydration and loss of salts occur, which 
can be fatal. Patients need rehydration therapy. This 
involves the provision of frequent sips of water and 
the use of rehydration drinks. These usually come in 
sachets available from pharmacists and supermarkets. 
The contents are dissolved in water and drunk to 
replace the salts and glucose that are lost through 
dehydration.

During physical activity, the body may sweat in 
order to maintain a steady temperature. If liquids 
are not drunk to compensate for water loss through 
sweating, the body can become dehydrated. Loss 
of water from the blood results in the plasma 
becoming more concentrated (its water potential 
decreases). Water is then drawn out of the red blood 
cells by osmosis. The cells become plasmolysed. 
Their surface area is reduced, causing them to be 
less effective in carrying oxygen. The shape of the 
cells is known as being crenated (see Figure 3.19).

People doing sport sometimes use sports drinks 

(Figure 3.20) which are isotonic (they have the same 
water potential as body fluids). The drinks contain water, 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_3.indd   45

Figure 3.19  Plasmolysed red blood cells

salts and glucose and are designed to replace lost water 
and salts, as well as providing energy, without creating 
osmotic problems to body cells. However, use of such 
drinks when not exercising vigorously can lead to weight 
gain in the same way as the prolonged use of any sugar-
rich drink.

possible to see the cytoplasm but its presence can be inferred 
from the fact that the red cell sap seems to have a distinct outer

as in Figure 3.13(b). Prepare six potato cylinders in this way 
and cut them all to the same length. (They should be at least 
50 mm long.) Measure them carefully.

n  Label six test-tubes with the concentration of sucrose solution 

in them (e.g. 0.0 mol dm–3, 0.2 mol dm–3, 0.4 mol dm–3, 
0.6 mol dm–3, 0.8 mol dm–3 and 1.0 mol dm–3) and place them 
in a test-tube rack. 

n  Add the same volume of the correct sucrose solution to each 

test-tube. 

n  Weigh a cylinder of potato, record its mass and place it in the 

fi rst test-tube. Repeat until all the test-tubes have been set 
up. 

n  Leave the tubes for at least 30 minutes.
n  After this time, remove the potato cylinder from the fi rst 
tube, surface dry the potato and re-weigh it. Notice also 
whether it is fi rm or fl abby. Repeat this for the other potato 
cylinders.

n  Calculate the change in mass and the percentage change in 

mass for each cylinder.

The plasmolysis can be reversed by drawing water under the 
coverslip in the same way that you drew the sugar solution 
under. It may need two or three lots of water to fl ush out all 
the sugar. If you watch a group of cells, you should see their 
vacuoles expanding to fi ll the cells once again.

Rhubarb is used for this experiment because the coloured cell 

sap shows up. If rhubarb is not available, the epidermis from a 
red onion scale can be used.

5   The effects of varying the concentration of sucrose 

solution on potato tissue

n  Push a No.4 or No.5 cork borer into a large potato.
  Caution: Do not hold the potato in your hand, but use a 

board as in Figure 3.13(a) on page 42.

n  Plot the results on a graph with sucrose concentration on the 
horizontal axis and percentage change in mass on the vertical 
axis. 

  Note: there will be negative as well as positive percentage 
changes in mass, so your graph axes will have to allow for 
this.

Result
The cylinders in the weaker sucrose solutions will have gained 
mass and feel fi rm. One of the cylinders may have shown no 
change in mass. The cylinders in the more concentrated sucrose 
solutions will have lost mass and feel limp. 

Interpretation
If the cells of the potato have absorbed water by osmosis, 
there will be an increase in the mass of the potato cylinder. 
This happens when the external solution has a higher water 
potential than that inside the potato cells. (The sucrose 
solution is less concentrated than the contents of the potato 
cells.) Water molecules move into each cell through the cell 
membrane. The water molecules move from a higher water 
potential to a lower water potential. The cells become turgid, 
so the cylinder feels fi rm.

If the cells of the potato have lost water by osmosis, there 

will be a decrease in mass of the potato cylinder. This happens 
when the external solution has a lower water potential than 
that inside the potato cells. (The sucrose solution is more 
concentrated than the contents of the potato cells.) Water 
molecules move out of each cell through the cell membrane. 
The water molecules move from a higher water potential to a 
lower water potential. The cells become plasmolysed or fl accid, 
so the cylinder feels fl abby.

6  Partial permeability

n  Take a 15 cm length of dialysis tubing which has been soaked 

in water and tie a knot tightly at one end. 

n  Use a dropping pipette to partly fill the tubing with 1% 

starch solution. 

n  Put the tubing in a test-tube and hold it in place with an 

elastic band as shown in Figure 3.25. 

n  Rinse the tubing and test-tube under the tap to remove all 

traces of starch solution from the outside of the dialysis tube.

n  Fill the test-tube with water and add a few drops of iodine 

solution to colour the water yellow. 

n  Leave for 10–15 minutes.
n  After this time, observe any changes in the solution in the test-tube.

Figure 3.25  Experiment to demonstrate the effect of a partially 
permeable membrane

Result
The starch inside the dialysis tubing goes blue but the iodine 
outside stays yellow or brown.

Interpretation
The blue colour is characteristic of the reaction which takes 
place between starch and iodine, and is used as a test for starch 
(see Chapter 4). The results show that iodine molecules have 
passed through the dialysis tubing into the starch but the starch 
molecules have not moved out into the iodine. This is what we 
would expect if the dialysis tubing were partially permeable on 
the basis of its pore size. Starch molecules are very large and 
probably cannot get through the pores. Iodine molecules are 
much smaller and can, therefore, get through.

Note: This experiment illustrates that movement of water is not 

necessarily involved and the pore size of the membrane makes it 
genuinely partially permeable with respect to iodine and starch.

●● Active transport

Key definition
Active transport is the movement of particles through a 

cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to 
a region of higher concentration using the energy from 
respiration.

The importance of active transport
If diffusion were the only method by which a cell 
could take in substances, it would have no control 
over what went in or out. Anything that was more 
concentrated outside would diffuse into the cell 
whether it was harmful or not. Substances which 
the cell needed would diffuse out as soon as their 
concentration inside the cell rose above that outside 
it. The cell membrane, however, has a great deal of 
control over the substances which enter and leave 
the cell.

In some cases, substances are taken into or 

expelled from the cell against the concentration 
gradient. For example, sodium ions may continue 
to pass out of a cell even though the concentration 
outside is greater than inside. The cells lining 
the small intestine take up glucose against a 
concentration gradient. The processes by which 
substances are moved against a concentration 
gradient are not fully understood and may be quite 
different for different substances but they are all 
generally described as active transport. 

Anything which interferes with respiration, such 

as a lack of oxygen or glucose, prevents active 
transport taking place. This indicates that active 
transport needs a supply of energy from respiration. 
Figure 3.26 shows a possible model to explain active 
transport.

The carrier molecules shown in Figure 3.26 

are protein molecules. As shown in (b), they are 
responsible for transporting substances across the 
membrane during active transport.

In some cases, a combination of active transport 

and controlled diffusion seems to occur. For 
example, sodium ions are thought to get into a cell 
by diffusion through special pores in the membrane 
and are expelled by a form of active transport. The 
reversed diffusion gradient for sodium ions created 
in this way is very important in the conduction of 
nerve impulses in nerve cells.

active transport

Epithelial cells in the villi of the small intestine have 
the role of absorbing glucose against a concentration 
gradient. The cells contain numerous mitochondria 
in which respiration takes place. The chemical energy 
produced is converted into kinetic energy for the 
movement of the glucose molecules. The same type 
of process occurs in the cells of the kidney tubules 
for the reabsorption of glucose molecules into the 
bloodstream against their concentration gradient.

Plants need to absorb mineral salts from the 
soil, but these salts are in very dilute solution. 
Active transport enables the cells of plant roots to 
take up salts from this dilute solution against the 
concentration gradient. Again, chemical energy 
from respiration is converted into kinetic energy for 
movement of the salts.

Questions
Core
  1  A 10% solution of copper sulfate is separated by a 

partially permeable membrane from a 5% solution of 
copper sulfate. 

  Will water diffuse from the 10% solution to the 5% 

solution or from the 5% solution to the 10% solution? 
Explain your answer.

  2  If a fresh beetroot is cut up, the pieces washed in water and 

then left for an hour in a beaker of water, little or no red 
pigment escapes from the cells into the water. If the beetroot 
is boiled fi rst, the pigment does escape into the water. 
Bearing in mind the properties of a living cell membrane, 
offer an explanation for this difference.

 

  3  In Experiment 1 (Figure 3.12), what do you think would 

happen in these cases?
a  A much stronger sugar solution was placed in the 

cellulose tube.

b  The beaker contained a weak sugar solution instead of 

water.

c  The sugar solution was in the beaker and the water was 

in the cellulose tube?

  4  In Experiment 1, the column of liquid accumulating in the 

capillary tube exerts an ever-increasing pressure on the 
solution in the dialysis tubing. Bearing this in mind and 
assuming a very long capillary, at what stage would you 
expect the net fl ow of water from the beaker into the 
dialysis tubing to cease?

Extended
  5  When doing experiments with animal tissues they 
are usually bathed in Ringer’s solution, which has a 
concentration similar to that of blood or tissue fl uid. 

  Why do you think this is necessary?
  6  Why does a dissolved substance reduce the number of 

‘free’ water molecules in a solution?

  7  When a plant leaf is in daylight, its cells make sugar from 

carbon dioxide and water. The sugar is at once turned into 
starch and deposited in plastids. 

  What is the osmotic advantage of doing this? (Sugar is 

soluble in water; starch is not.)

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 3 you should know and understand the 
following:

•  Diffusion is the result of molecules of liquid, gas or dissolved 

solid moving about.

•  The molecules of a substance diffuse from a region where 
they are very concentrated to a region where they are less 
concentrated.

•  Substances may enter cells by simple diffusion, controlled 

diffusion or active transport. 

•  Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a partially 

permeable membrane, from a dilute solution of salt or 
sugar to a concentrated solution because the concentrated 
solution contains fewer free water molecules.

•  Cell membranes are partially permeable and cytoplasm and 

cell sap contain many substances in solution.

•  Cells take up water from dilute solutions but lose water to 

concentrated solutions because of osmosis.

•  Osmosis maintains turgor in plant cells.
•  Active transport involves the movement of substances 

against their concentration gradient.

•  Active transport requires energy.

•  Kinetic energy of molecules and ions results in their 

diffusion.

•  Osmosis involves the diffusion of water from a region 
of higher water potential to a region of lower water 
potential through a partially permeable membrane.
•  The meanings of the terms turgid, turgor pressure, 

plasmolysis and ﬂ accid.

•  The importance of water potential and osmosis to animal 

and plant cells.

•  Turgor pressure in cells provides support in plants.
•  Active transport is important as it allows movement of 
substances across membranes against a concentration 
gradient.

●● Biological molecules
Carbon is an element present in all biological 
molecules. Carbon atoms can join together to form 
chains or ring structures, so biological molecules 
can be very large (macromolecules), often 
constructed of repeating sub-units (monomers). 
Other elements always present are oxygen and 
hydrogen. Nitrogen is sometimes present. When 
macromolecules are made of long chains of 
monomers held together by chemical bonds, they 
are known as polymers (poly means ‘many’). 
Examples are polysaccharides (chains of single sugar 
units such as glucose), proteins (chains of amino 
acids) and nucleic acids (chains of nucleotides). 
Molecules constructed of lots of small units often 
have different properties from their sub-units, 
making them suitable for specifi c functions in living 
things. For example, glucose is very soluble and has 
no strength, but cellulose (a macromolecule made 
of glucose units) is insoluble and very tough – ideal 
for the formation of cell walls around plant cells.

Cells need chemical substances to make new 

cytoplasm and to produce energy. Therefore the 
organism must take in food to supply the cells 
with these substances. Of course, it is not quite as 
simple as this; most cells have specialised functions 
(Chapter 2) and so have differing needs. However, 
all cells need water, oxygen, salts and food 
substances and all cells consist of water, proteins, 
lipids, carbohydrates, salts and vitamins or their 
derivatives.
Carbohydrates
These may be simple, soluble sugars or complex 
materials like starch and cellulose, but all 
carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen 
only. A commonly occurring simple sugar is glucose, 
which has the chemical formula C6H12O6.

The glucose molecule is often in the form of a ring,

Sugars with a single carbon ring are called 
monosaccharides, e.g. glucose and fructose. Those 
sugars with two carbon rings in their molecules 
are called disaccharides, e.g. maltose and sucrose. 
Mono- and disaccharides are readily soluble in water.
When many glucose molecules are joined together, 

the carbohydrate is called a polysaccharide. 
Glycogen (Figure 4.3) is a polysaccharide that 
forms a food storage substance in many animal 
cells. The starch molecule is made up of hundreds 
of glucose molecules joined together to form long 
chains. Starch is an important storage substance 
in the plastids of plant cells. Plastids are important 
organelles in plant cells. They are the sites where 
molecules like starch are made and stored. One 
familiar example of a plastid is the chloroplast. 
Cellulose consists of even longer chains of glucose 
molecules. The chain molecules are grouped 
together to form microscopic fi bres, which are laid 
down in layers to form the cell wall in plant cells 
(Figures 4.4 and 4.5).

Polysaccharides are not readily soluble in water.

cellulose molecules.

Fats
Fats are a solid form of a group of molecules called 
lipids. When lipids are liquid they are known 
as oils. Fats and oils are formed from carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen only. A molecule of fat (or 
oil) is made up of three molecules of an organic 
acid, called a fatty acid, combined with one 
molecule of glycerol.

Lipids form part of the cell membrane and the 
internal membranes of the cell such as the nuclear 
membrane. Droplets of fat or oil form a source of 
energy when stored in the cytoplasm.
Proteins
Some proteins contribute to the structures of the 
cell, e.g. to the cell membranes, the mitochondria, 
ribosomes and chromosomes. These proteins are 
called structural proteins.

There is another group of proteins called enzymes. 

Enzymes are present in the membrane systems, in 
the mitochondria, in special vacuoles and in the fluid 
part of the cytoplasm. Enzymes control the chemical 
reactions that keep the cell alive (see Chapter 5).

Although there are many different types of protein, 

all contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, 
and many contain sulfur. Their molecules are made 
up of long chains of simpler chemicals called amino 
acids (Figure 4.7).

This is a category of substances which, in their 
chemical structure at least, have little in common. 
Plants can make their own vitamins. Animals have to 

●● Proteins
There are about 20 different amino acids in animal 
proteins, including alanine, leucine, valine, glutamine, 
cysteine, glycine and lysine. A small protein molecule 
might be made up from a chain consisting of a 
hundred or so amino acids, e.g. glycine–valine–valine–
cysteine–leucine–glutamine–, etc. Each type of protein 
has its amino acids arranged in a particular sequence.
The chain of amino acids in a protein takes up a 
particular shape as a result of cross-linkages. Cross-
linkages form between amino acids that are not 
neighbours, as shown in Figure 4.8. The shape of a 
protein molecule has a very important effect on its 
reactions with substances, as explained in ‘Enzymes’ 
in Chapter 5. 

Proteins

obtain many of their vitamins ready-made. Vitamins, 
or substances derived from them, play a part in 
chemical reactions in cells – for example those which 
involve a transfer of energy from one compound to 
another. If cells are not supplied with vitamins or the 
substances needed to make them, the cell physiology 
is thrown out of order and the whole organism 
suffers. One example of a vitamin is ascorbic acid 
(vitamin C) (see ‘Diet’ in Chapter 7).
Water
Most cells contain about 75% water and will die if 
their water content falls much below this. Water is a 
good solvent and many substances move about the 
cells in a watery solution. 
Synthesis and conversion in cells
Cells are able to build up (synthesise) or break down 
their proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, or change 
one to another. For example, animal cells synthesise 
glycogen from glucose by joining glucose molecules 
together (Figure 4.3); plant cells synthesise starch 
and cellulose from glucose. All cells can make 
proteins from amino acids and they can build up fats 
from glycerol and fatty acids. Animal cells can change 
carbohydrates to lipids, and lipids to carbohydrates; 
they can also change proteins to carbohydrates but 
they cannot make proteins unless they are supplied 
with amino acids. Plant cells, on the other hand, can 
make their own amino acids starting from sugars and 
salts. The cells in the green parts of plants can even 
make glucose starting from only carbon dioxide and 
water (see ‘Photosynthesis’ in Chapter 6).

For example, the shape of an enzyme molecule 
creates an active site, which has a complementary 
shape to the substrate molecule on which it acts. 
This makes enzymes very specific in their action 
(they usually only work on one substrate).

Antibodies are proteins produced by white 

blood cells called lymphocytes. Each antibody has 
a binding site, which can lock onto pathogens such 
as bacteria. This destroys the pathogen directly, or 
marks it so that it can be detected by other white 
blood cells called phagocytes. Each pathogen has 
antigens on its surface that are a particular shape, so 
specific antibodies with complementary shapes to the 
antigen are needed (see Chapter 10, page 149).

 4  BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES

When a protein is heated to temperatures over 

50 °C, the cross-linkages in its molecules break 
down; the protein molecules lose their shape and will 
not usually regain it even when cooled. The protein 
is said to have been denatured. Because the shape of 
the molecules has been altered, the protein will have 
lost its original properties.

Egg-white is a protein. When it is heated, its 
molecules change shape and the egg-white goes 
from a clear, runny liquid to a white solid and cannot 
be changed back again. The egg-white protein, 
albumen, has been denatured by heat.

Proteins form enzymes and many of the structures in 

the cell, so if they are denatured the enzymes and the 
cell structures will stop working and the cell will die. 
Whole organisms may survive for a time above 50 °C 
depending on the temperature, the period of exposure 
and the proportion of the cells that are damaged.

●● Structure of DNA
A DNA molecule is made up of long chains of 
nucleotides, formed into two strands. A nucleotide is a 
5-carbon sugar molecule joined to a phosphate group 
(–PO3) and an organic base (Figure 4.9). In DNA 
the sugar is deoxyribose and the organic base is either 
adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) or guanine (G). 
Note: for exam purposes, it is only necessary to be 

able state the letters, not the names of these bases. 

The nucleotides are joined by their phosphate 
groups to form a long chain, often thousands of 
nucleotides long. The phosphate and sugar molecules 
are the same all the way down the chain but the bases 
may be any one of the four listed above (Figure 4.10).

The DNA in a chromosome consists of two 

strands (chains of nucleotides) held together by 
chemical bonds between the bases. The size of 
the molecules ensures that A (adenine) always 
pairs with T (thymine) and C (cytosine) pairs with 

G (guanine). The double strand is twisted to form a 
helix (like a twisted rope ladder with the base pairs 
representing the rungs) (Figures 4.11 and 4.12).

Water

●● Water
Water molecules take part in a great many vital 
chemical reactions. For example, in green plants, 
water combines with carbon dioxide to form sugar 
(see Chapter 6). In animals, water helps to break 
down and dissolve food molecules (see ‘Chemical 
digestion’ in Chapter 7). Blood is made up of cells 
and a liquid called plasma. This plasma is 92% water 
and acts as a transport medium for many dissolved 
substances, such as carbon dioxide, urea, digested 
food and hormones. Blood cells are carried around 
the body in the plasma. 

Water also acts as a transport medium in plants. 

Water passes up the plant from the roots to the 
leaves in xylem vessels and carries with it dissolved 
mineral ions. Phloem vessels transport sugars and 
amino acids in solution from the leaves to their 
places of use or storage (see Chapter 8). 

Water plays an important role in excretion in 

animals. It acts as a powerful solvent for excretory 
materials, such as nitrogenous molecules like urea, as 
well as salts, spent hormones and drugs. The water 
has a diluting effect, reducing the toxicity of the 
excretory materials.

The physical and chemical properties of water 
differ from those of most other liquids but make 
it uniquely effective in supporting living activities. 
For example, water has a high capacity for heat 
(high thermal capacity). This means that it can 
absorb a lot of heat without its temperature rising 
to levels that damage the proteins in the cytoplasm. 
However, because water freezes at 0 °C most cells 
are damaged if their temperature falls below this 
and ice crystals form in the cytoplasm. (Oddly 
enough, rapid freezing of cells in liquid nitrogen at 
below –196 °C does not harm them).

●● Extension work
DNA
In 1869, a chemist working on cell chemistry 
discovered a compound that contained nitrogen and 
phosphorus (as well as carbon). This was an unusual 
combination. The substance seemed to originate 
from nuclei and was at fi rst called ‘nuclein’ and then 
‘nucleic acid’. Subsequent analysis revealed the bases 
adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine in nucleic 
acid, together with a carbohydrate later identifi ed 
as deoxyribose. In the early 1900s, the structure of 
nucleotides (base–sugar–phosphate, Figure 4.9) was 
determined and also how they linked up to form 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

In the 1940s, a chemist, Chargaff, showed that, 
in a sample of DNA, the number of adenines (A) 
was always the same as the number of thymines (T). 
Similarly, the amounts of cytosine (C) and 
guanine (G) were always equal. This information was 
to prove crucial to the work of Crick and Watson in 
determining the structure of DNA.

Francis Crick was a physicist and James Watson 
(from the USA) a biologist. They worked together 
in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge in 
the 1950s. They did not do chemical analyses or 
experiments, but used the data that was available 
from X-ray crystallography and the chemistry of 
nucleotides to try out different models for the 
structure of DNA.

The regular pattern of atoms in a crystal causes 

a beam of X-rays to be scattered in such a way that 
the structure of the molecules in the crystal can be 
determined (Figure 4.13(a)). The scattered X-rays 
are directed on to a photographic plate which, when 
developed, reveals images similar to the one in 
Figure 4.13(b).

 one of the X-ray images produced by X-rays scattered by 
DNA. The number and positions of the dark areas allows the 
molecular structure to be calculated.
By precise measurements of the spots on the 
photograph and some very complex mathematics, 
the molecular structure of many compounds could 
be discovered.

It proved possible to obtain DNA in a crystalline 

form and subject it to X-ray analysis. Most of the 
necessary X-ray crystallography was carried out by 
Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King’s 
College, London.

Crick and Watson assembled models on a  trial-
and-error basis. The suitability of the model was 
judged by how well it conformed to the X-ray 
measurements and the chemical properties of the 
components.

The evidence all pointed to a helical structure (like 
a spiral staircase). At fi rst they tried models with a core 
of three or four nucleotide chains twisted around each 
other and with the bases attached to the outside.

These models did not really fi t the X-ray data or 
the chemical structures of the nucleotides. Watson 
tried a two-chain helical model with the bases 
pointing inwards. Initially he paired adenine (A) with 
adenine (A), cytosine (C) with cytosine (C), etc. But 
thymine (T) and cytosine (C) were smaller molecules 
than adenine (A) and guanine (G) and this pairing 
would distort the double helix.

This is where Chargaff’s work came to the rescue. 

If there were equal numbers of adenine (A) and 
thymine (T), and equal numbers of cytosine (C) 
and guanine (G), it was likely that this pairing of 
bases, large plus small, would fi t inside the sugar–
phosphate double helix without distortion.

Water

The X-ray data confi rmed that the diameter of 

the helix would allow this pairing and the chemistry 
of the bases would allow them to hold together. 
The outcome is the model of DNA shown in 
Figures 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12.

Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the 

Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 
1962. Rosalind Franklin died in 1958, so her vital 
contribution was not formally rewarded.

Practical work

Food tests
1  Test for starch
■  Shake a little starch powder in a test-tube with some warm 

water to make a suspension.

■  Add 3 or 4 drops of iodine solution. A dark blue colour 

should be produced.

Note: it is also possible to use iodine solution to test for starch 
in leaves, but a different procedure is used (see Chapter 6).

2  Test for reducing sugar
■  Heat a little glucose solution with an equal volume of 

Benedict’s solution in a test-tube. The heating is done 
by placing the test-tube in a beaker of boiling water (see 
Figure 4.15), or warming it gently over a blue Bunsen ﬂ ame. 
However, if this second technique is used, the test-tube 
should be moved constantly in and out of the Bunsen ﬂ ame 
to prevent the liquid boiling and shooting out of the tube. 
The solution will change from clear blue to cloudy green, 
then yellow and ﬁ nally to a red precipitate (deposit) of 
copper(I) oxide.

3  Test for protein (Biuret test)
■  To a 1% solution of albumen (the protein of egg-white) add 

5 cm3 dilute sodium hydroxide (CARE: this solution is caustic), 
followed by 5 cm3 1% copper sulfate solution. A purple colour 
indicates protein. If the copper sulfate is run into the food

solution without mixing, a violet halo appears where the two 
liquids come into contact.

4  Test for fat
■  Shake two drops of cooking oil with about 5 cm3 ethanol in a 

dry test-tube until the fat dissolves.

■  Pour this solution into a test-tube containing a few cm3 water. 
A milky white emulsion will form. This shows that the solution 
contained some fat or oil.

5  Test for vitamin C
■  Draw up 2 cm3 fresh lemon juice into a plastic syringe.
■  Add this juice drop by drop to 2 cm3 of a 0.1% solution of 

DCPIP (a blue dye) in a test-tube. The DCPIP will become 
colourless quite suddenly as the juice is added. The amount of 
juice added from the syringe should be noted down.

■  Repeat the experiment but with orange juice in the syringe. If 
it takes more orange juice than lemon juice to decolourise the 
DCPIP, the orange juice must contain less vitamin C.

Application of the food tests
The tests can be used on samples of food such as milk, potato, 
raisins, onion, beans, egg-yolk or peanuts to ﬁ nd out what food 
materials are present. The solid samples are crushed in a mortar 
and shaken with warm water to extract the soluble products. 
Separate samples of the watery mixture of crushed food are 
tested for starch, glucose or protein as described above. To test 
for fats, the food must ﬁ rst be crushed in ethanol, not water, and 
then ﬁ ltered. The clear ﬁ ltrate is poured into water to see if it 
goes cloudy, indicating the presence of fats.

Question
Core
1  a  What do the chemical structures of carbohydrates and 

fats have in common?

b  How do their chemical structures differ?
c  Suggest why there are many more different proteins 

than there are carbohydrates.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 4 you should know and understand the 
following:

•  Living matter is made up of a number of important types of 

molecules, including proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.

•  All three types of molecule contain carbon, hydrogen and 

oxygen atoms; proteins also contain nitrogen and sometimes 
phosphorus or sulfur.

•  Carbohydrates are made from monosaccharide units, often 

glucose.

58

•  Carbohydrates are used as an energy source; glycogen and 
starch make good storage molecules. Cellulose gives plant 
cell walls their strength.

•  Proteins are built up from amino acids joined together by 

chemical bonds.

•  Lipids include fats, fatty acids and oils.
•  Fats are made from fatty acids and glycerol.
•  Proteins and lipids form the membranes outside and inside 

the cell.

•  Food tests are used to identify the main biological 

molecules.

•  Water is important in living things as a solvent.

•  In different proteins the 20 or so amino acids are in 

different proportions and arranged in different sequences.
•  The structure of a protein molecule enables it to carry out 

speciﬁ c roles as enzymes and antibodies.

•  DNA is another important biological molecule. It has a 

very distinctive shape, made up of nucleotides containing 
bases.

•  Water has an important role as a solvent in organisms.

Key defi nitions
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical 

reaction and is not changed by the reaction.

An enzyme is a protein that functions as a biological catalyst.

Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts. They 
are made in all living cells. Enzymes, like catalysts, 
can be used over and over again because they 
are not used up during the reaction and only a 
small amount is needed to speed the reaction up 
(Figure 5.1).

●● Enzyme action
How an enzyme molecule might work to join 
two other molecules together and so form a more 
complicated substance (the product) is shown in 
Figure 5.2.

An example of an enzyme-controlled reaction 

such as this is the joining up of two glucose 

molecules to form a molecule of maltose. You 
can see that the enzyme and substrate molecules 
have complementary shapes (like adjacent pieces 
of a jigsaw) so they fit together. Other substrate 
molecules would not fit into this enzyme as they 
would have the ‘wrong’ shape. For example, the 
substrate molecule in Figure 5.2(b) would not 
fit the enzyme molecule in Figure 5.2(a). The 
product (substance AB in Figure 5.2(a)) is released 
by the enzyme molecule and the enzyme is then 
free to repeat the reaction with more substrate 
molecules. Molecules of the two substances 
might have combined without the enzyme being 
present, but they would have done so very slowly 
(it could take hours or days to happen without 
the enzyme). By bringing the substances close 
together, the enzyme molecule makes the reaction 
take place much more rapidly. The process can 
be extremely fast: it has been found that catalase, 
a very common enzyme found in most cells, 
can break down 40 000 molecules of hydrogen 
peroxide every second! A complete chemical 
reaction takes only a few seconds when the right 
enzyme is present.

As well as enzymes being responsible for joining 

two substrate molecules together, such as two glucose 
molecules to form maltose, they can also create long 
chains. For example, hundreds of glucose molecules 
can be joined together, end to end, to form a long 
molecule of starch to be stored in the plastid of a 
plant cell. The glucose molecules can also be built 
up into a molecule of cellulose to be added to the 
cell wall. Protein molecules are built up by enzymes, 
which join together tens or hundreds of amino acid 
molecules. These proteins are added to the cell 
membrane, to the cytoplasm or to the nucleus of 
the cell. They may also become the proteins that 
act as enzymes.

pH

Figure 5.3  The effect of pH on digestive enzymes 

The protein-digesting enzyme in your stomach, for 
example, works well at an acidity of pH 2. At this pH, 
the enzyme amylase, from your saliva, cannot work 
at all. Inside the cells, most enzymes will work best 
in neutral conditions (pH 7). The pH or temperature 
at which an enzyme works best is often called its 
optimum pH or temperature. Conditions in the 
duodenum are slightly alkaline: the optimum pH for 
pancreatic lipase is pH 8.

Figure 5.2 shows how the shape of an enzyme 
molecule could be very important if it has to fit 
the substances on which it acts. Above 50 °C the 
shapes of enzymes are permanently changed and the 
enzymes can no longer combine with the substances.

This is one of the reasons why organisms may be 
killed by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. 
The enzymes in their cells are denatured and the 
chemical reactions proceed too slowly to maintain life.
One way to test whether a substance is an enzyme 

is to heat it to boiling point. If it can still carry 
out its reactions after this, it cannot be an enzyme. 
This technique is used as a ‘control’ (see ‘Aerobic 
respiration’ in Chapter 12) in enzyme experiments.
Enzymes and pH
Acid or alkaline conditions alter the chemical 
properties of proteins, including enzymes. Most 
enzymes work best at a particular level of acidity or 
alkalinity (pH), as shown in Figure 5.3.

Enzyme action

Although changes in pH affect the activity of 
enzymes, these effects are usually reversible, i.e.  
an enzyme that is inactivated by a low pH will 
resume its normal activity when its optimum pH  
is restored. 
Rates of enzyme reactions
As explained above, the rate of an enzyme-controlled 
reaction depends on the temperature and pH. It also 
depends on the concentrations of the enzyme and its 
substrate. The more enzyme molecules produced by 
a cell, the faster the reaction will proceed, provided 
there are enough substrate molecules available. 
Similarly, an increase in the substrate concentration 
will speed up the reaction if there are enough 
enzyme molecules to cope with the additional 
substrate.

Intra- and extracellular enzymes
All enzymes are made inside cells. Most of them remain 
inside the cell to speed up reactions in the cytoplasm 
and nucleus. These are called intracellular enzymes 
(‘intra’ means ‘inside’). In a few cases, the enzymes 
made in the cells are let out of the cell to do their 
work outside. These are extracellular enzymes (‘extra’ 
means ‘outside’). Fungi and bacteria (see ‘Features of 
organisms’ in Chapter 1) release extracellular enzymes 
in order to digest their food. A mould growing on a 
piece of bread releases starch-digesting enzymes into 
the bread and absorbs the soluble sugars that the 
enzyme produces from the bread. In the digestive 
systems of animals (‘Alimentary canal’ in Chapter 7), 
extracellular enzymes are released into the stomach and 
intestines in order to digest the food.

An enzyme-controlled reaction involves three groups 
of molecules, although the product may be two or 
more different molecules:

substrate  enzyme  product

dioxide and water in order to produce energy 
(Chapter 12).

Reactions that split large molecules into smaller 

ones are called catabolic reactions.

The substance on which an enzyme acts is called its 
substrate and the molecules produced are called 
the products. Thus, the enzyme sucrase acts on the 
substrate sucrose to produce the monosaccharide 
products glucose and fructose.

Reactions in which large molecules are built up 

from smaller molecules are called anabolic reactions 
(Figure 5.2(a)). When the enzyme combines with 
the substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is 
formed temporarily.

Figure 5.2(b) shows an enzyme speeding up 
a chemical change, but this time it is a reaction 
in which the molecule of a substance is split 
into smaller molecules. Again, when the enzyme 
combines with the substrate, an enzyme-substrate 
complex is formed temporarily. Try chewing a 
piece of bread, but keep it in your mouth without 
swallowing it. Eventually you should detect the 
food tasting sweeter, as maltose sugar is formed. 
If starch is mixed with water it will break down 
very slowly to sugar, taking several years. In your 
saliva there is an enzyme called amylase that can 
break down starch to sugar in minutes or seconds. 
In cells, many of the ‘breaking-down’ enzymes 
are helping to break down glucose to carbon 

Enzymes are specific
This means simply that an enzyme which normally 
acts on one substance will not act on a different 
one. Figure 5.2(a) shows how the shape of an 
enzyme can control what substances it combines 
with. The enzyme in Figure 5.2(a) has a shape called 
the active site, which exactly fits the substances 
on which it acts, but will not fit the substance in 
Figure 5.2(b). So, the shape of the active site of the 
enzyme molecule and the substrate molecule are 
complementary. Thus, an enzyme which breaks 
down starch to maltose will not also break down 
proteins to amino acids. Also, if a reaction takes 
place in stages, e.g.

starch 
maltose 

  maltose (stage 1)
  glucose (stage 2)

a different enzyme is needed for each stage.

The names of enzymes usually end with -ase and 
they are named according to the substance on which 
they act, or the reaction which they speed up. For 
example, an enzyme that acts on proteins may be 
called a protease; one that removes hydrogen from a 
substance is a dehydrogenase.

Figure 5.4  Graph showing the effect of temperature on the rate of an 
enzyme-controlled reaction 

Generally, a rise of 10 °C will double the rate of 
an enzyme-controlled reaction in a cell, up to 
an optimum temperature of around 37 °C (body 
temperature). This is because the enzyme and 
substrate molecules are constantly moving, using 
kinetic energy. The reaction only occurs when the 
enzyme and substrate molecules come into contact 
with each other. As the temperature is increased, the 
molecules gain more kinetic energy, so they move 
faster and there is a greater chance of collisions 
happening. Therefore the rate of reaction increases. 
Above the optimum temperature the reaction will 
slow down. This is because enzyme molecules are 
proteins. Protein molecules start to lose their shape 
at higher temperatures, so the active site becomes 
deformed. Substrate molecules cannot fi t together 
with the enzyme, stopping the reaction. Not all the 
enzyme molecules are affected straight away, so the 
reaction does not suddenly stop – it is a gradual 
process as the temperature increases above 37 °C. 
Denaturation is a permanent change in the shape 
of the enzyme molecule. Once it has happened 
the enzyme will not work any more, even if the 
temperature is reduced below 37 °C. An example 
of a protein denaturing is the cooking of egg-white 
(made of the protein albumin). Raw egg-white is 
liquid, transparent and colourless. As it is heated, it 

62

turns solid and becomes opaque and white. It cannot 
be changed back to its original state or appearance.

Enzymes and pH
Extremes of pH may denature some enzymes 
irreversibly. This is because the active site of the 
enzyme molecule can become deformed (as it does 
when exposed to high temperatures). As a result, 
the enzyme and substrate molecules no longer have 
complementary shapes and so will not fi t together. 

Practical work
Tests for proteins, fats and carbohydrates are described in 
Chapter 4. Experiments on the digestive enzymes amylase and 
pepsin are described in Chapter 7.

1  Extracting and testing an enzyme from living cells
In this experiment, the enzyme to be extracted and tested is 
catalase and the substrate is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Certain 
reactions in the cell produce hydrogen peroxide, which is 
poisonous. Catalase makes the hydrogen peroxide harmless by 
breaking it down to water and oxygen.

n  Grind a small piece of liver with about 20 cm3 water and a 

little sand in a mortar. This will break open the liver cells and 
release their contents. 

n  Filter the mixture and share it between two test-tubes, A 

and B. The fi ltrate will contain a great variety of substances 
dissolved out from the cytoplasm of the liver cells, including 
many enzymes. Because enzymes are specifi c, however, only 
one of these, catalase, will act on hydrogen peroxide. 

n  Add some drops of the fi ltrate from test-tube A to a few cm3 

of hydrogen peroxide in a test-tube. You will see a vigorous 
reaction as the hydrogen peroxide breaks down to produce 
oxygen. (The oxygen can be tested with a glowing splint.)

n  Now boil the fi ltrate in tube B for about 30 seconds. Add a 

few drops of the boiled fi ltrate to a fresh sample of hydrogen 
peroxide. There will be no reaction because boiling has 
denatured the catalase.

n  Next, shake a little manganese(IV) oxide powder in a test-
tube with some water and pour this into some hydrogen 
peroxide. There will be a vigorous reaction similar to the one 
with the liver extract. If you now boil some manganese(IV) 
oxide with water and add this to hydrogen peroxide, the 
reaction will still occur. Manganese(IV) oxide is a catalyst 
but it is not an enzyme because heating has not altered its 
catalytic properties.

n  The experiment can be repeated with a piece of potato to 

compare its catalase content with that of the liver. The piece 
of potato should be about the same size as the liver sample.

Investigate a range of plant tissues to find out 
which is the best source of catalase. Decide how 
to make quantitative comparisons (observations

2  The effect of temperature on an enzyme reaction
Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch to a sugar (maltose).

Enzyme action

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 5 you should know and understand 
the following:

•  Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of chemical 

reactions and are not changed in the process.

•  Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. 
•  Enzymes are important in all organisms because they 

maintain a reaction speed needed to sustain life.

•  The substance on which an enzyme acts is called the 

substrate. After the reaction, a product is formed.

•  An enzyme and its substrate have complementary shapes. 
•  Enzymes are affected by pH and temperature and are 

denatured above 50 °C.

•  Different enzymes may accelerate reactions which build 

up or break down molecules.

•  Each enzyme acts on only one substance (breaking down) 

or a pair of substances (building up).

•  Enzymes tend to be very specifi c in the reactions they 

catalyse, due to the complementary shape of the enzyme 
and its substrate.

•  Changes in temperature affect the kinetic energy of 

enzyme molecules and their shape. 

•  Enzymes can be denatured by changes in temperature 

and pH.

 ● Photosynthesis

Key defi nition
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants manufacture 

carbohydrates from raw materials using energy from light.

All living organisms need food. They need it as a source 
of raw materials to build new cells and tissues as they 
grow. They also need food as a source of energy. Food 
is a kind of ‘fuel’ that drives essential living processes 
and brings about chemical changes (see ‘Diet’ in 
Chapter 7 and ‘Aerobic respiration’ in Chapter 12). 
Animals take in food, digest it and use the digested 
products to build their tissues or to produce energy.

Plants also need energy and raw materials but, apart 
from a few insect-eating species, plants do not appear to 
take in food. The most likely source of their raw materials 
would appear to be the soil. However, experiments show 
that the weight gained by a growing plant is far greater 
than the weight lost by the soil it is growing in. So 
there must be additional sources of raw materials.

Jean-Baptiste van Helmont was a Dutch scientist 
working in the 17th century. At that time very little 
was known about the process of photosynthesis. He 
carried out an experiment using a willow shoot. He 
planted the shoot in a container with 90.8 kg of dry 
soil and placed a metal grill over the soil to prevent 
any accidental gain or loss of mass. He left the shoot 
for 5 years in an open yard, providing it with only 
rainwater and distilled water for growth. After 5 years 
he reweighed the tree and the soil (see Figure 6.1) 
and came to the conclusion that the increase in mass 
of the tree (74.7 kg) was due entirely to the water it 
had received. However, he was unaware that plants 
also take in mineral salts and carbon dioxide, or that 
they use light as a source of energy.

Figure 6.1  Van Helmont’s experiment 

A hypothesis to explain the source of food in a 
plant is that it makes it from air, water and soil salts. 
Carbohydrates (Chapter 4) contain the elements carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen, as in glucose (C6H12O6). The 
carbon and oxygen could be supplied by carbon dioxide 
(CO2) from the air, and the hydrogen could come from 
the water (H2O) in the soil. The nitrogen and sulfur 
needed for making proteins (Chapter 4) could come 
from nitrates and sulfates in the soil.

This building-up of complex food molecules from 

simpler substances is called synthesis and it needs 
enzymes and energy to make it happen. The enzymes 
are present in the plant’s cells and the energy for the 
fi rst stages in the synthesis comes from sunlight. The 
process is, therefore, called photosynthesis (‘photo’ 

66

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_6.indd   66

means ‘light’). There is evidence to suggest that the 
green substance, chlorophyll, in the chloroplasts of 
plant cells, plays a part in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll 
absorbs sunlight and makes the energy from sunlight 
available for chemical reactions. Thus, in effect, the 
function of chlorophyll is to convert light energy to 
chemical energy.

A chemical equation for photosynthesis would be

carbon  
dioxide + water 

light energy
chlorophyll

 glucose + oxygen

In order to keep the equation simple, glucose is 
shown as the food compound produced. In reality, 
the glucose is rapidly converted to sucrose for 
transport around the plant, then stored as starch or 
converted into other molecules.

Practical work

Experiments to investigate 
photosynthesis
The design of biological experiments is discussed in Chapter 12 
‘Aerobic respiration’, and this should be revised before studying 
the next section. 

A hypothesis is an attempt to explain certain observations. 

In this case the hypothesis is that plants make their food by 
photosynthesis. The equation shown above is one way of stating 
the hypothesis and is used here to show how it might be tested.

If photosynthesis is occurring in a plant, then the leaves should 
be producing sugars. In many leaves, as fast as sugar is produced 
it is turned into starch. Since it is easier to test for starch than for 
sugar, we regard the production of starch in a leaf as evidence 
that photosynthesis has taken place.

The first three experiments described below are designed to 
see if the leaf can make starch without chlorophyll, sunlight or 
carbon dioxide, in turn. If the photosynthesis hypothesis is sound, 
then the lack of any one of these three conditions should stop 
photosynthesis, and so stop the production of starch. But, if 
starch production continues, then the hypothesis is no good and 
must be altered or rejected.

In designing the experiments, it is very important to make sure 

that only one variable is altered. If, for example, the method of 
keeping light from a leaf also cuts off its carbon dioxide supply, 
it would be impossible to decide whether it was the lack of light 
or lack of carbon dioxide that stopped the production of starch. 
To make sure that the experimental design has not altered more 
than one variable, a control is set up in each case. This is an 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_6.indd   67

Photosynthesis

identical situation, except that the condition missing from the 
experiment, e.g. light, carbon dioxide or chlorophyll, is present in 
the control (see ‘Aerobic respiration’ in Chapter 12).

Destarching a plant
If the production of starch is your evidence that photosynthesis 
is taking place, then you must make sure that the leaf does not 
contain any starch at the beginning of the experiment. This is 
done by destarching the leaves. It is not possible to remove 
the starch chemically, without damaging the leaves, so a plant 
is destarched simply by leaving it in darkness for 2 or 3 days. 
Potted plants are destarched by leaving them in a dark cupboard 
for a few days. In the darkness, any starch in the leaves will be 
changed to sugar and carried away from the leaves to other 
parts of the plant. For plants in the open, the experiment is  
set up on the day before the test. During the night, most of  
the starch will be removed from the leaves. Better still, wrap  
the leaves in aluminium foil for 2 days while they are still  
on the plant. Then test one of the leaves to see that no starch  
is present.

Testing a leaf for starch
Iodine solution (yellow/brown) and starch (white) form a deep 
blue colour when they mix. The test for starch, therefore, is to 
add iodine solution to a leaf to see if it goes blue. However, a 
living leaf is impermeable to iodine and the chlorophyll in the  
leaf masks any colour change. So, the leaf has to be treated  
as follows:

boiling
alcohol

Figure 6.2  Experiment to remove chlorophyll from a leaf

n  Heat some water to boiling point in a beaker and then turn 

off the Bunsen flame.

n  Use forceps to dip a leaf in the hot water for about 

30 seconds. This kills the cytoplasm, denatures the enzymes 
and makes the leaf more permeable to iodine solution.

n  Note: make sure the Bunsen flame is extinguished before 

starting the next part of the procedure, as ethanol is 
flammable.

 6  Plant nutrition

n  Push the leaf to the bottom of a test-tube and cover it with 

ethanol (alcohol). Place the tube in the hot water (Figure 6.2). 
The alcohol will boil and dissolve out most of the chlorophyll. 
This makes colour changes with iodine easier to see. 

n  Pour the green alcohol into a spare beaker, remove the leaf 

and dip it once more into the hot water to soften it.

n  Spread the decolourised leaf flat on a white tile and drop iodine 

solution on to it. The parts containing starch will turn blue; 
parts without starch will stain brown or yellow with iodine.

1  Is chlorophyll necessary for photosynthesis?
It is not possible to remove chlorophyll from a leaf without 
killing it, and so a variegated leaf, which has chlorophyll only in 
patches, is used. A leaf of this kind is shown in Figure 6.3(a). The 
white part of the leaf serves as the experiment, because it lacks 
chlorophyll, while the green part with chlorophyll is the control. 
After being destarched, the leaf – still on the plant – is exposed 
to daylight for a few hours. Remove a leaf from the plant; draw 
it carefully to show where the chlorophyll is (i.e. the green parts) 
and test it for starch as described above.

Result 
Only the parts that were previously green turn blue with iodine. 
The parts that were white stain brown (Figure 6.3(b)).

(a) variegated leaf
Figure 6.3  Experiment to show that chlorophyll is necessary

(b) after testing for starch

Interpretation
Since starch is present only in the parts that originally contained 
chlorophyll, it seems reasonable to suppose that chlorophyll is 
needed for photosynthesis.

It must be remembered, however, that there are other possible 

interpretations that this experiment has not ruled out; for 
example, starch could be made in the green parts and sugar in 
the white parts. Such alternative explanations could be tested by 
further experiments.

2  Is light necessary for photosynthesis?

n  Cut a simple shape from a piece of aluminium foil to make  

a stencil and attach it to a destarched leaf (Figure 6.4(a)). 
n  After 4 to 6 hours of daylight, remove the leaf and test  

it for starch.

Result
Only the areas which had received light go blue with iodine 
(Figure 6.4(b)).

Figure 6.4  Experiment to show that light is necessary

Interpretation
As starch has not formed in the areas that received no light, 
it seems that light is needed for starch formation and thus for 
photosynthesis.

You could argue that the aluminium foil had stopped carbon 

dioxide from entering the leaf and that it was shortage of 
carbon dioxide rather than absence of light which prevented 
photosynthesis taking place. A further control could be designed, 
using transparent material instead of aluminium foil for  
the stencil.

3  Is carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis?

n  Water two destarched potted plants and enclose their shoots 

in polythene bags. 

n  In one pot place a dish of soda-lime to absorb the carbon 

dioxide from the air (the experiment). In the other place a dish 
of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution to produce carbon 
dioxide (the control), as shown in Figure 6.5. 

n  Place both plants in the light for several hours and then test a 

leaf from each for starch.

Result
The leaf that had no carbon dioxide does not turn blue.  
The one from the polythene bag containing carbon dioxide  
does turn blue.

Interpretation
The fact that starch was made in the leaves that had carbon 
dioxide, but not in the leaves that had no carbon dioxide, 
suggests that this gas must be necessary for photosynthesis. 
The control rules out the possibility that high humidity or high 
temperature in the plastic bag prevents normal photosynthesis.

4  Is oxygen produced during photosynthesis?

n  Place a short-stemmed funnel over some Canadian pondweed 

in a beaker of water. 

n  Fill a test-tube with water and place it upside-down over 

the funnel stem (Figure 6.6). (The funnel is raised above the 
bottom of the beaker to allow the water to circulate.) 

n  Place the apparatus in sunlight. Bubbles of gas should appear 

from the cut stems and collect in the test-tube. 

n  Set up a control in a similar way but place it in a dark 

cupboard. 

n  When sufficient gas has collected from the plant in the light, 

remove the test-tube and insert a glowing splint.

Result
The glowing splint bursts into flames.

Interpretation
The relighting of a glowing splint does not prove that the gas 
collected in the test-tube is pure oxygen, but it does show that it 
contains extra oxygen and this must have come from the plant. 
The oxygen is given off only in the light.

Note that water contains dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide 

and nitrogen. These gases may diffuse in or out of the bubbles 
as they pass through the water and collect in the test-tube. The 
composition of the gas in the test-tube may not be the same as 
that in the bubbles leaving the plant.

Photosynthesis

Controls
When setting up an experiment and a control, which of the two 
procedures constitutes the ‘control’ depends on the way the 
prediction is worded. For example, if the prediction is that ‘in the 
absence of light, the pondweed will not produce oxygen’, then 
the ‘control’ is the plant in the light. If the prediction is that ‘the 
pondweed in the light will produce oxygen’, then the ‘control’ is 
the plant in darkness. As far as the results and interpretation are 
concerned, it does not matter which is the ‘control’ and which is 
the ‘experiment’.

The results of the four experiments support the hypothesis of 

photosynthesis as stated at the beginning of this chapter and 
as represented by the equation. Starch formation (our evidence 
for photosynthesis) does not take place in the absence of light, 
chlorophyll or carbon dioxide, and oxygen production occurs only 
in the light.

If starch or oxygen production had occurred in the absence 

of any one of these conditions, we should have to change 
our hypothesis about the way plants obtain their food. Bear 
in mind, however, that although our results support the 
photosynthesis theory, they do not prove it. For example, it 
is now known that many stages in the production of sugar 
and starch from carbon dioxide do not need light (the ‘light-
independent’ reaction).

5  What is the effect of changing light intensity on 
the rate of photosynthesis? (Method 1)
In this investigation, the rate of production of bubbles by a pond 
plant is used to calculate the rate of photosynthesis.

n  Prepare a beaker of water or a boiling tube, into which a 

spatula end of sodium hydrogencarbonate has been stirred 
(this dissolves rapidly and saturates the water with carbon 
dioxide, so CO2 is not a limiting factor).

n  Collect a fresh piece of Canadian pondweed and cut one end 

of the stem, using a scalpel blade. 

n  Attach a piece of modelling clay or paperclip to the stem and 

put it into the beaker (or boiling tube). 

n  Set up a light source 10 cm away from the beaker and switch 
on the lamp (Figure 6.7). Bubbles should start appearing from 
the cut end of the plant stem. Count the number of bubbles 
over a fixed time e.g. 1 minute and record the result. Repeat 
the count.

 6  Plant nutrition

n  Now move the light source so that it is 20 cm from the beaker. 

Switch on the lamp and leave it for a few minutes, to allow 
the plant to adjust to the new light intensity. Count the 
bubbles as before and record the results.

n  Repeat the procedure so that the numbers of bubbles for at 

least fi ve different distances have been recorded. Also, try 
switching off the bench lamp and observe any change in the 
production of bubbles.

n  There is a relationship between the distance of the lamp from 

the plant and the light intensity received by the plant. Light 
intensity =  1
2D

 where D = distance.

n  Convert the distances to light intensity, then plot a graph 

of light intensity/arbitrary units (x-axis) against rate of 
photosynthesis/bubbles per minute (y-axis).

Note: in this investigation another variable, which could affect 
the rate of photosynthesis, is the heat given off from the bulb. To 
improve the method, another beaker of water could be placed 
between the bulb and the plant to act as a heat fi lter while 
allowing the plant to receive the light.
n  If the bubbles appear too rapidly to count, try tapping a pen 
or pencil on a sheet of paper at the same rate as the bubbles 
appear and get your partner to slide the paper slowly along for 
15 seconds. Then count the dots (Figure 6.8).

Figure 6.8  Estimating the rate of bubble production

Result 
The rate of bubbling should decrease as the lamp is moved 
further away from the plant. When the light is switched off, the 
bubbling should stop.

Interpretation
Assuming that the bubbles contain oxygen produced by 
photosynthesis, as the light intensity is increased the rate of 
photosynthesis (as indicated by the rate of oxygen bubble 
production) increases. This is because the plant uses the light 
energy to photosynthesise and oxygen is produced as a waste 
product. The oxygen escapes from the plant through the cut 
stem. We are assuming also that the bubbles do not change 
in size during the experiment. A fast stream of small bubbles 
might represent the same volume of gas as a slow stream of 
large bubbles.

6  What is the effect of changing light intensity on 
the rate of photosynthesis? (Method 2)
This alternative investigation uses leaf discs from land plants 
(Figure 6.9).

Figure 6.9  Using leaf discs to investigate the effect of light intensity 
on photosynthesis 

(d)

n  Use a cork borer or paper hole punch to cut out discs from 

a fresh, healthy leaf such as spinach, avoiding any veins 
(Figure 6.9(a)). The leaves contain air spaces. These cause the 
leaf discs to fl oat when they are placed in water. 

n  At the start of the experiment, the air needs to be removed 
from the discs. To do this place about 10 discs into a large 
(10 cm3) syringe and tap it so the discs fall to the bottom 
(opposite the plunger end). 

n  Place one fi nger over the hole at the end of the syringe barrel. 

Fill the barrel with water, then replace the plunger. 

n  Turn the syringe so the needle end is facing up and release 

your fi nger. 

n  Gently push the plunger into the barrel of the syringe to force 

out any air from above the water (Figure 6.9(b)). 

n  Now replace your fi nger over the syringe hole and withdraw 

the plunger to create a vacuum. 

n  Keep the plunger withdrawn for about 10 seconds. This sucks 
out all the air from the leaf discs. They should then sink to the 
bottom (Figure 6.9(c)). Release the plunger. 

n  Repeat the procedure if the discs do not all sink.
n  Remove the discs from the syringe and place them in a beaker, 
containing water, with a spatula of sodium hydrogencarbonate 
dissolved in it (Figure 6.9(d)). 

n  Start a stopwatch and record the time taken for each of the 
discs to fl oat to the surface. Ignore those that did not sink. 
Calculate an average time for the discs to fl oat.

n  Repeat the method, varying the light intensity the discs are 
exposed to in the beaker (see Experiment 5 for varying the 
light intensity produced by a bench lamp).

Result 
The greater the light intensity, the quicker the leaf discs fl oat to 
the surface.

Interpretation
As the leaf discs photosynthesise they produce oxygen, which is 
released into the air spaces in the disc. The oxygen makes the 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_6.indd   70

discs more buoyant, so as the oxygen accumulates, they fl oat to 
the surface of the water. As light intensity increases, the rate of 
photosynthesis increases.

7  What is the effect of changing carbon dioxide 
 concentration on the rate of photosynthesis?
Sodium hydrogencarbonate releases carbon dioxide when 
dissolved in water. Use the apparatus shown in Figure 6.10.

n  To set this up, remove the plunger from the 20 cm3 syringe and 
place two or three pieces of pondweed, with freshly cut stems 
facing upwards, into the syringe barrel. Hold a fi nger over the 
end of the capillary tube and fi ll the syringe with distilled water. 

n  Replace the plunger, turn the apparatus upside down and 

push the plunger to the 20 cm3 mark, making sure that no air 
is trapped. 

n  Arrange the apparatus as shown in Figure 6.10 and move 
the syringe barrel until the meniscus is near the top of the 
graduations on the ruler. The bulb should be a fi xed distance 
from the syringe, e.g. 10 cm. 

n  Switch on the lamp and measure the distance the meniscus 

moves over 3 minutes. Repeat this several times, then calculate 
an average. 

n  Repeat the procedure using the following concentrations of 
sodium hydrogencarbonate solution: 0.010, 0.0125, 0.0250, 
0.0500 and 0.1000 mol dm−3. 

n  Plot a graph of the concentration of sodium 

hydrogencarbonate solution (x-axis) against the mean distance 
travelled by the meniscus (y-axis).

Result
The higher the concentration of sodium hydrogencarbonate 
solution, the greater the distance moved by the meniscus.

Photosynthesis

Interpretation
As the concentration of available carbon dioxide is increased, 
the distance travelled by the meniscus also increases. The 
movement of the meniscus is caused by oxygen production by 
the pondweed due to photosynthesis. So an increase in carbon 
dioxide increases the rate of photosynthesis.

8  What is the effect of changing temperature on the 
rate of photosynthesis?
Use the methods described in Experiments 5 or 6, but vary the 
temperature of the water instead of the light intensity.

The process of photosynthesis
Although the details of photosynthesis vary in 
different plants, the hypothesis as stated in this 
chapter has stood up to many years of experimental 
testing and is universally accepted. The next 
section describes how photosynthesis takes place in 
a plant.

The process takes place mainly in the cells of 

the leaves (Figure 6.11) and is summarised in

 6  Plant nutrition

Figure 6.12. In land plants water is absorbed 
from the soil by the roots and carried in the 
water vessels of the veins, up the stem to the 
leaf. Carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air 
through the stomata (pores in the leaf, see ‘Leaf 
structure’ later in this chapter). In the leaf cells, 
the carbon dioxide and water are combined to 
make sugar. The energy for this reaction comes 
from sunlight that has been absorbed by the green 
pigment chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is present 
in the chloroplasts of the leaf cells and it is inside 
the chloroplasts that the reaction takes place. 
Chloroplasts (Figure 6.12(d)) are small, green 
structures present in the cytoplasm of the leaf cells. 
Chlorophyll is the substance that gives leaves and 
stems their green colour. It is able to absorb  
energy from light and use it to split water 
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen (the ‘light’ 
or ‘light-dependent’ reaction). The oxygen escapes 
from the leaf and the hydrogen molecules are 
added to carbon dioxide molecules to form sugar 
(the ‘dark’ or ‘light-independent’ reaction). In 
this way the light energy has been transferred into 
the chemical energy of carbohydrates as they are 
synthesised. 

Figure 6.11  All the reactions involved in producing food take place in 
the leaves. Notice how little the leaves overlap

There are four types of chlorophyll that may be 
present in various proportions in different species. 
There are also a number of photosynthetic pigments, 
other than chlorophyll, which may mask the 
colour of chlorophyll even when it is present, e.g. 
the brown and red pigments that occur in certain

The plant’s use of photosynthetic 
products
The glucose molecules produced by photosynthesis 
are quickly built up into starch molecules and added to 
the growing starch granules in the chloroplast. If the 
glucose concentration was allowed to increase in the 
mesophyll cells of the leaf, it could disturb the osmotic 
balance between the cells (see ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3). 
Starch is a relatively insoluble compound and so does 
not alter the osmotic potential of the cell contents.
The starch, however, is steadily broken down 
to sucrose (Chapter 4) and this soluble sugar is 
transported out of the cell into the food-carrying 
cells (see Chapter 8) of the leaf veins. These veins 
will distribute the sucrose to all parts of the plant 
that do not photosynthesise, e.g. the growing buds, 
the ripening fruits, the roots and the underground 
storage organs.

The cells in these regions will use the sucrose in a 

variety of ways (Figure 6.13).

Respiration
The sugar can be used to provide energy. It is 
oxidised by respiration (Chapter 12) to carbon 
dioxide and water, and the energy released is used to 
drive other chemical reactions such as the building-
up of proteins described below.

Storage
Sugar that is not needed for respiration is turned into 
starch and stored. Some plants store it as starch grains 
in the cells of their stems or roots. Other plants, 
such as the potato or parsnip, have special storage 
organs (tubers) for holding the reserves of starch 
(see ‘Asexual reproduction’ in Chapter 16). Sugar 
may be stored in the fruits of some plants; grapes, for 
example, contain a large amount of glucose.

Synthesis of other substances
As well as sugars for energy and starch for storage, the 
plant needs cellulose for its cell walls, lipids for its cell 
membranes, proteins for its cytoplasm and pigments 
for its flower petals, etc. All these substances are built 
up (synthesised) from the sugar molecules and other 
molecules produced in photosynthesis.

By joining hundreds of glucose molecules 
together, the long-chain molecules of cellulose 
(Chapter 4, Figure 4.4) are built up and added to 
the cell walls.

Amino acids (see Chapter 4) are made by 
combining nitrogen with sugar molecules or 
smaller carbohydrate molecules. These amino acids 
are then joined together to make the proteins that 
form the enzymes and the cytoplasm of the cell. 
The nitrogen for this synthesis comes from  
nitrates which are absorbed from the soil by  
the roots.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_6.indd   73

Some proteins also need sulfur molecules and 

these are absorbed from the soil in the form of 
sulfates (SO4). Phosphorus is needed for DNA 
(Chapter 4) and for reactions involving energy 
release. It is taken up as phosphates (PO4).

Many other elements, e.g. iron, manganese, 

boron, are also needed in very small quantities for 
healthy growth. These are often referred to as  
trace elements.

The chlorophyll molecule needs magnesium (Mg). 

This metallic element is also obtained from salts in 
the soil.

Figure 6.13  Green plants can make all the materials they need from 
carbon dioxide, water and salts.

The metallic and non-metallic elements are all taken 
up in the form of their ions by the plant roots.

All these chemical processes, such as the uptake 

of salts and the building-up of proteins, need energy 
from respiration to make them happen.

Gaseous exchange in plants
Air contains the gases nitrogen, oxygen, carbon 
dioxide and water vapour. Plants and animals take in 
or give out these last three gases and this process is 
called gaseous exchange.

You can see from the equation for photosynthesis 

that one of its products is oxygen. Therefore, 
in daylight, when photosynthesis is going on in 
green plants, they will be taking in carbon dioxide 
and giving out oxygen. This exchange of gases 
is the opposite of that resulting from respiration 
(Chapter 12) but it must not be thought that green 
plants do not respire. The energy they need for all 
their living processes – apart from photosynthesis 
– comes from respiration, and this is going on all 
the time, using up oxygen and producing carbon 
dioxide.

During the daylight hours, plants are 

photosynthesising as well as respiring, so that all the 
carbon dioxide produced by respiration is used up 

by photosynthesis. At the same time, all the oxygen 
needed by respiration is provided by photosynthesis. 
Only when the rate of photosynthesis is faster than 
the rate of respiration will carbon dioxide be taken in 
and the excess oxygen given out (Figure 6.14).

Figure 6.14  Respiration and photosynthesis

Compensation point 
As the light intensity increases during the morning 
and fades during the evening, there will be a time 
when the rate of photosynthesis exactly matches the 
rate of respiration. At this point, there will be no net 
intake or output of carbon dioxide or oxygen. This 
is the compensation point. The sugar produced by 
photosynthesis exactly compensates for the sugar 
broken down by respiration.

Practical work

How will the gas exchange of a 
plant be affected by being kept in 
the dark and in the light?
This investigation makes use of hydrogencarbonate indicator, 
which is a test for the presence of carbon dioxide. A build-up 
of carbon dioxide turns it from pink/red to yellow. A decrease 
in carbon dioxide levels causes the indicator to turn purple.

n  Wash three boiling tubes first with tap water, then with 

distilled water and finally with hydrogencarbonate indicator 
(the indicator will change colour if the boiling tube is not 
clean). 

n  Then fill the three boiling tubes to about two thirds full with 

hydrogencarbonate indicator solution. 

n  Add equal-sized pieces of Canadian pondweed to tubes 1 

and 2 and seal all the tubes with stoppers. 

n  Expose tubes 1 and 3 to light using a bench lamp and place 

tube 2 in a black box, or a dark cupboard, or wrap it in 
aluminium foil (Figure 6.15). After 24 hours note the colour 
of the hydrogencarbonate indicator in each tube.

 Limiting factors

Key definition
A limiting factor is something present in the environment in 

such short supply that it restricts life processes.

hydrogencarbonate
indicator (pink/red
at start)

Figure 6.15  Experiment to compare gas exchange in plants kept in the 
dark and in the light 

Result
The indicator in tube 3 (the control) which was originally  
pink/red should not change colour; that in tube 2 (plant in the 
dark) should turn yellow; and in tube 1 (plant in the light) the 
indicator should be purple.

Interpretation
Hydrogencarbonate indicator is a mixture of dilute sodium 
hydrogencarbonate solution with the dyes cresol red and thymol 
blue. It is a pH indicator in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide, 
i.e. its original colour represents the acidity produced by the 
carbon dioxide in the air. An increase in carbon dioxide makes it 
more acidic and it changes colour from orange/red to yellow. A 
decrease in carbon dioxide makes it less acid and causes a colour 
change to purple.

The results, therefore, provide evidence that in the light 

(tube 1) aquatic plants use up more carbon dioxide in 
photosynthesis than they produce in respiration. In darkness 
(tube 2) the plant produces carbon dioxide (from respiration). 
Tube 3 is the control, showing that it is the presence of the 
plant that causes a change in the solution in the boiling tube.

The experiment can be criticised on the grounds that the 
hydrogencarbonate indicator is not a specific test for carbon 
dioxide but will respond to any change in acidity or alkalinity. In 
tube 1 there would be the same change in colour if the leaf 
produced an alkaline gas such as ammonia, and in tube 2 any 
acid gas produced by the leaf would turn the indicator yellow. 
However, knowledge of the metabolism of the leaf suggests that 
these are less likely events than changes in the carbon dioxide 
concentration.

Effects of external factors on rate 
of photosynthesis
The rate of the light reaction will depend on the 
light intensity. The brighter the light, the faster 
will water molecules be split in the chloroplasts. 
The ‘dark’ reaction will be affected by temperature. 
A rise in temperature will increase the rate at which 

If you look at Figure 6.16(a), you will see that an 
increase in light intensity does indeed speed up 
photosynthesis, but only up to a point. Beyond 
that point, any further increase in light intensity 
has only a small effect. This limit on the rate of 
increase could be because all available chloroplasts 
are fully occupied in light absorption. So, no matter 
how much the light intensity increases, no more 
light can be absorbed and used. Alternatively, the 
limit could be imposed by the fact that there is not 
enough carbon dioxide in the air to cope with the 
increased supply of hydrogen atoms produced by the 
light reaction. Or, it may be that low temperature is 
restricting the rate of the ‘dark’ reaction.

Figure 6.16(b) shows that, if the temperature of a 

plant is raised, then the effect of increased illumination 
is not limited so much. Thus, in Figure 6.16(a), it seems 
likely that the increase in the rate of photosynthesis 
could have been limited by the temperature. Any one 
of the external factors – temperature, light intensity 
or carbon dioxide concentration – may limit the 
effects of the other two. A temperature rise may cause 
photosynthesis to speed up, but only to the point 
where the light intensity limits further increase. In such 
conditions, the external factor that restricts the effect of 
the others is called the limiting factor.

Since there is only 0.03% of carbon dioxide in 
the air, it might seem that a shortage of carbon 
dioxide could be an important limiting factor. 
Indeed, experiments do show that an increase in 
carbon dioxide concentration does allow a faster rate 
of photosynthesis. However, recent work in plant 
physiology has shown that the extra carbon dioxide 
affects reactions other than photosynthesis.

The main effect of extra carbon dioxide is to slow 

down the rate of oxidation of sugar by a process 
called photorespiration and this produces the same 
effect as an increase in photosynthesis.

Although carbon dioxide concentration limits 

photosynthesis only indirectly, artificially high levels 
of carbon dioxide in greenhouses do effectively 
increase yields of crops (Figure 6.17).

 6  Plant nutrition

Greenhouses also maintain a higher temperature 

and so reduce the effect of low temperature as a 
limiting factor, and they clearly optimise the light 
reaching the plants.

Parts of the world such as tropical countries often 
benefit from optimum temperatures and rainfall for 
crop production. However, greenhouses are still 
often used because they allow the growers to control 
how much water and nutrients the plants receive and 
they can also reduce crop damage by insect pests and 
disease. Sometimes rainfall is too great to benefit the 
plants. In an experiment in the Seychelles in the wet 
season of 1997, tomato crops in an open field yielded 
2.9 kg m−2. In a greenhouse, they yielded 6.5 kg m−2.

Figure 6.16  Limiting factors in photosynthesis

The concept of limiting factors does not apply only 
to photosynthesis. Adding fertiliser to the soil, for 
example, may increase crop yields, but only up to the 
point where the roots can take up all the nutrients 
and the plant can build them into proteins, etc. The 
uptake of mineral ions is limited by the absorbing 
area of the roots, rates of respiration, aeration 
of the soil and availability of carbohydrates from 
photosynthesis.

carbon dioxide from left to right

Currently there is debate about whether athletic 
performance is limited by the ability of the heart  
and lungs to supply oxygenated blood to muscles,  
or by the ability of the muscles to take up and use 
the oxygen.

The role of the stomata
The stomata (Figure 6.20) in a leaf may affect the 
rate of photosynthesis according to whether they 
are open or closed. When photosynthesis is taking 
place, carbon dioxide in the leaf is being used up 
and its concentration falls. At low concentrations 
of carbon dioxide, the stomata will open. Thus, 
when photosynthesis is most rapid, the stomata 
are likely to be open, allowing carbon dioxide 
to diffuse into the leaf. When the light intensity 
falls, photosynthesis will slow down and the build-
up of carbon dioxide from respiration will make 
the stomata close. In this way, the stomata are 
normally regulated by the rate of photosynthesis 
rather than photosynthesis being limited by the 
stomata. However, if the stomata close during the 
daytime as a result of excessive water loss from the 
leaf, their closure will restrict photosynthesis by 
preventing the inward diffusion of atmospheric 
carbon dioxide.

Normally the stomata are open in the daytime and 

closed at night. Their closure at night, when intake 
of carbon dioxide is not necessary, reduces the loss 
of water vapour from the leaf (see ‘Transpiration’ in 
Chapter 8).

leaf structure

 ● Leaf structure
The relationship between a leaf and the rest of the 
plant is described in Chapter 8. 

A typical leaf of a broad-leaved plant is shown in 
Figure 6.18(a). (Figure 6.18(b) shows a transverse 
section through the leaf.) It is attached to the stem 
by a leaf stalk, which continues into the leaf as a 
midrib. Branching from the midrib is a network of 

veins that deliver water and salts to the leaf cells and 
carry away the food made by them.

As well as carrying food and water, the network of 
veins forms a kind of skeleton that supports the softer 
tissues of the leaf blade.

The leaf blade (or lamina) is broad. A vertical 

section through a small part of a leaf blade is shown 
in Figure 6.18(c) and Figure 6.19 is a photograph of 
a leaf section under the microscope.

Epidermis
The epidermis is a single layer of cells on the upper 
and lower surfaces of the leaf. There is a thin waxy 
layer called the cuticle over the epidermis.
Stomata
In the leaf epidermis there are structures called 
stomata (singular = stoma). A stoma consists of a 
pair of guard cells (Figure 6.20) surrounding an 
opening or stomatal pore. In most dicotyledons 
(i.e. the broad-leaved plants; see ‘Features of 
organisms’ in Chapter 1), the stomata occur only in 
the lower epidermis. In monocotyledons (i.e. narrow-
leaved plants such as grasses) the stomata are equally 
distributed on both sides of the leaf. 

Figure 6.20  Stomata in the lower epidermis of a leaf (×350)

78

vascular

Mesophyll
The tissue between the upper and lower 
epidermis is called mesophyll (Figure 6.18(c)). 
It consists of two zones: the upper palisade 
mesophyll and the lower spongy mesophyll 
(Figure 6.23). The palisade cells are usually long 
and contain many chloroplasts. Chloroplasts 
are green organelles, due to the presence of the 
pigment chlorophyll, found in the cytoplasm 
of the photosynthesising cells. The spongy 
mesophyll cells vary in shape and fit loosely 
together, leaving many air spaces between them. 
They also contain chloroplasts. 

Veins (vascular bundles)
The main vein of the leaf is called the midrib. Other 
veins branch off from this and form a network 
throughout the leaf. Vascular bundles consist of two 
different types of tissues, called xylem and phloem. 
The xylem vessels are long thin tubes with no cell 
contents when mature. They have thickened cell 
walls, impregnated with a material called lignin, 
which can form distinct patterns in the vessel walls, 
e.g. spirals (see Chapter 8). Xylem carries water and 
salts to cells in the leaf. The phloem is in the form 
of sieve tubes. The ends of each elongated cell are 
perforated to form sieve plates and the cells retain 
their contents. Phloem transports food substances 
such as sugars away from the leaf to other parts of 
the plant.

Made of wax, waterproofi ng the leaf. It is secreted by cells of the upper epidermis.
These cells are thin and transparent to allow light to pass through. No chloroplasts are present. They act as a barrier to disease 
organisms. 
The main region for photosynthesis. Cells are columnar (quite long) and packed with chloroplasts to trap light energy. They receive 
carbon dioxide by diffusion from air spaces in the spongy mesophyll.
These cells are more spherical and loosely packed. They contain chloroplasts, but not as many as in palisade cells. Air spaces between 
cells allow gaseous exchange – carbon dioxide to the cells, oxygen from the cells during photosynthesis.
This is a leaf vein, made up of xylem and phloem. Xylem vessels bring water and minerals to the leaf. Phloem vessels transport sugars 
and amino acids away (this is called translocation).
This acts as a protective layer. Stomata are present to regulate the loss of water vapour (this is called transpiration). It is the site of 
gaseous exchange into and out of the leaf.
Each stoma is surrounded by a pair of guard cells. These can control whether the stoma is open or closed. Water vapour passes out 
during transpiration. Carbon dioxide diffuses in and oxygen diffuses out during photosynthesis. 

Functions of parts of the leaf
 Epidermis
The epidermis helps to keep the leaf’s shape. 
The closely fi tting cells (Figure 6.18(c)) reduce 
evaporation from the leaf and prevent bacteria and 
fungi from getting in. The cuticle is a waxy layer 
lying over the epidermis, which helps to reduce 
water loss. It is produced by the epidermal cells. 
 Stomata
Changes in the turgor (see ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3) 
and shape of the guard cells can open or close the 
stomatal pore. In very general terms, stomata are 
open during the hours of daylight but closed during 
the evening and most of the night (Figure 6.21). 
This pattern, however, varies greatly with the plant 
species. A satisfactory explanation of stomatal 
rhythm has not been worked out, but when the 
stomata are open (i.e. mostly during daylight), they 
allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf where it 
is used for photosynthesis.

If the stomata close, the carbon dioxide 

supply to the leaf cells is virtually cut off and 
photosynthesis stops. However, in many species, 
the stomata are closed during the hours of 
darkness, when photosynthesis is not taking place 
anyway.

It seems, therefore, that stomata allow carbon 

dioxide into the leaf when photosynthesis is taking 
place and prevent excessive loss of water vapour (see 
‘Transpiration’ in Chapter 8) when photosynthesis 
stops, but the story is likely to be more complicated 
than this.

The detailed mechanism by which stomata open 
and close is not fully understood, but it is known 
that in the light, the potassium concentration in 
the guard cell vacuoles increases. This lowers the 
water potential (see ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3) of the 
cell sap and water enters the guard cells by osmosis 
from their neighbouring epidermal cells. This 

79

 6  Plant nutrition

infl ow of water raises the turgor pressure inside the 
guard cells.

The cell wall next to the stomatal pore is thicker 
than elsewhere in the cell and is less able to stretch 
(Figure 6.22). So, although the increased turgor 
tends to expand the whole guard cell, the thick inner 
wall cannot expand. This causes the guard cells to 
curve in such a way that the stomatal pore between 
them is opened.

Figure 6.22  Structure of guard cells

When potassium ions leave the guard cell, the 
water potential rises, water passes out of the cells by 
osmosis, the turgor pressure falls and the guard cells 
straighten up and close the stoma.

Where the potassium ions come from and what 
triggers their movement into or out of the guard 
cells is still under active investigation.

You will notice from Figures 6.21 and 6.22 
that the guard cells are the only epidermal cells 
containing chloroplasts. At one time it was 
thought that the chloroplasts built up sugar by 
photosynthesis during daylight, that the sugars made 
the cell sap more concentrated and so caused the 
increase in turgor. In fact, little or no photosynthesis 
takes place in these chloroplasts and their function 
has not been explained, though it is known that 
starch accumulates in them during the hours of 
darkness. In some species of plants, the guard cells 
have no chloroplasts.
 Mesophyll
The function of the palisade cells and – to a lesser 
extent – of the spongy mesophyll cells is to make 
food by photosynthesis. Their chloroplasts absorb 
sunlight and use its energy to join carbon dioxide 

and water molecules to make sugar molecules as 
described earlier in this chapter.

In daylight, when photosynthesis is rapid, the 
mesophyll cells are using up carbon dioxide. As 
a result, the concentration of carbon dioxide in 
the air spaces falls to a low level and more carbon 
dioxide diffuses in (Chapter 3) from the outside 
air, through the stomata (Figure 6.23). This 
diffusion continues through the air spaces, up to 
the cells which are using carbon dioxide. These 
cells are also producing oxygen as a by-product of 
photosynthesis. When the concentration of oxygen 
in the air spaces rises, it diffuses out through 
the stomata.
 Vascular bundles
The water needed for making sugar by 
photosynthesis is brought to the mesophyll cells by 
the veins. The mesophyll cells take in the water by 
osmosis (Chapter 3) because the concentration of 
free water molecules in a leaf cell, which contains 
sugars, will be less than the concentration of 
water in the water vessels of a vein. The branching 
network of leaf veins means that no cell is very far 
from a water supply.

The sugars made in the mesophyll cells are passed 

to the phloem cells (Chapter 8) of the veins, and 
these cells carry the sugars away from the leaf into 
the stem.

The ways in which a leaf is thought to be well 

adapted to its function of photosynthesis are listed in 
the next paragraph.

Adaptation of leaves for 
photosynthesis
When biologists say that something is adapted, they 
mean that its structure is well suited to its function. 
The detailed structure of the leaf is described in the 
fi rst section of this chapter and although there are 
wide variations in leaf shape, the following general 
statements apply to a great many leaves, and are 
illustrated in Figures 6.18(b) and (c).
• Their broad, fl at shape offers a large surface area 

for absorption of sunlight and carbon dioxide.

• Most leaves are thin and the carbon dioxide only 
has to diffuse across short distances to reach the 
inner cells.

• The large spaces between cells inside the leaf 

provide an easy passage through which carbon 
dioxide can diffuse.

• There are many stomata (pores) in the lower 

surface of the leaf. These allow the exchange of 
carbon dioxide and oxygen with the air outside.

• There are more chloroplasts in the upper 
(palisade) cells than in the lower (spongy 
mesophyll) cells. The palisade cells, being on the 
upper surface, will receive most sunlight and this 

will reach the chloroplasts without being absorbed 
by too many cell walls.

• The branching network of veins provides a good 
water supply to the photosynthesising cells. No 
cell is very far from a water-conducting vessel in 
one of these veins.

Although photosynthesis takes place mainly in the 
leaves, any part of the plant that contains chlorophyll 
will photosynthesise. Many plants have green stems 
in which photosynthesis takes place.

 ● Mineral requirements
Plants need a source of nitrate ions (NO3−) for 
making amino acids (Chapter 4). Amino acids are 
important because they are joined together to make 
proteins, needed to form the enzymes and cytoplasm 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_6.indd   81

of the cell. Nitrates are absorbed from the soil by the 
roots. 

Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are needed to form 

chlorophyll, the photosynthetic pigment in chloroplasts. 
This metallic element is also obtained in salts from the soil 
(see the salts listed under ‘Water cultures’ on page 82).

Sources of mineral elements and 
effects of their deficiency
The substances mentioned previously (nitrates, 
magnesium) are often referred to as ‘mineral salts’  
or ‘mineral elements’. If any mineral element is 
lacking, or deficient, in the soil then the plants may 
show visible deficiency symptoms.

Many slow-growing wild plants will show no 

deficiency symptoms even on poor soils. Fast-growing 
crop plants, on the other hand, will show distinct 
deficiency symptoms though these will vary according 
to the species of plant. If nitrate ions are in short 
supply, the plant will show stunted growth. The stem 
becomes weak. The lower leaves become yellow and 
die, while the upper leaves turn pale green. If the plant 
is deficient in magnesium, it will not be able to make 
magnesium. The leaves turn yellow from the bottom 
of the stem upwards (a process called chlorosis). 
Farmers and gardeners can recognise these symptoms 
and take steps to replace the missing minerals.

The mineral elements needed by plants are absorbed 

from the soil in the form of salts. For example, a 
plant’s needs for potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) 
might be met by absorbing the ions of the salt 
potassium nitrate (KNO3). Salts like this come 
originally from rocks, which have been broken down 
to form the soil. They are continually being taken up 
from the soil by plants or washed out of the soil by 
rain. They are replaced partly from the dead remains 
of plants and animals. When these organisms die and 
their bodies decay, the salts they contain are released 
back into the soil. This process is explained in some 
detail, for nitrates, in Chapter 19 ‘Nutrient cycles’.
In arable farming, the ground is ploughed and 
whatever is grown is removed. There are no dead 
plants left to decay and replace the mineral salts. 
The farmer must replace them by spreading animal 
manure, sewage sludge or artificial fertilisers in 
measured quantities over the land.

Three manufactured fertilisers in common 

use are ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and 
compound NPK.
 Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)
The formula shows that ammonium nitrate is 
a rich source of nitrogen but no other plant 

nutrients. It is sometimes mixed with calcium 
carbonate to form a compound fertiliser such as 
‘Nitro-chalk’.
 Superphosphates
These fertilisers are mixtures of minerals. They 
all contain calcium and phosphate and some have 
sulfate as well.
 Compound NPK fertiliser
‘N’ is the chemical symbol for nitrogen, ‘P’ for 
phosphorus and ‘K’ for potassium. NPK fertilisers 
are made by mixing ammonium sulfate, ammonium 
phosphate and potassium chloride in varying 
proportions. They provide the ions of nitrate, 
phosphate and potassium, which are the ones 
most likely to be below the optimum level in an 
agricultural soil.

 Water cultures
It is possible to demonstrate the importance of the 
various mineral elements by growing plants in water 
cultures. A full water culture is a solution containing 
the salts that provide all the necessary elements for 
healthy growth, such as
• potassium nitrate for potassium and nitrogen
• magnesium sulfate for magnesium and sulfur
• potassium phosphate for potassium and 

phosphorus

• calcium nitrate for calcium and nitrogen.

From these elements, plus the carbon dioxide, water 
and sunlight needed for photosynthesis, a green 
plant can make all the substances it needs for a 
healthy existence.

Some branches of horticulture, e.g. growing of 
glasshouse crops, make use of water cultures on a 
large scale. Sage plants may be grown with their 
roots in flat polythene tubes. The appropriate 
water culture solution is pumped along these tubes 
(Figure 6.24). This method has the advantage that 
the yield is increased and the need to sterilise the soil 
each year, to destroy pests, is eliminated. This kind 
of technique is sometimes described as hydroponics 
or soil-less culture.

Practical work

The importance of different 
mineral elements
n  Place wheat seedlings in test-tubes containing water cultures 

as shown in Figure 6.25. 

n  Cover the tubes with aluminium foil to keep out light and so 

stop green algae from growing in the solution. 

n  Some of the solutions have one of the elements missing. For 
example, magnesium chloride is used instead of magnesium 
sulfate and so the solution will lack sulfur. In a similar way, 
solutions lacking nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus can  
be prepared.

n  Leave the seedlings to grow in these solutions for a few 
weeks, keeping the tubes topped up with distilled water.

Result
The kind of result that might be expected from wheat seedlings 
is shown in Figure 6.26. Generally, the plants in a complete 
culture will be tall and sturdy, with large, dark green leaves. 
The plants lacking nitrogen will usually be stunted and  
have small, pale leaves. In the absence of magnesium, 
chlorophyll cannot be made, and these plants will be small 
with yellow leaves.

Interpretation
The healthy plant in the full culture is the control and shows that 
this method of raising plants does not affect them. The other, 
less healthy plants show that a full range of mineral elements is 
necessary for normal growth.

Quantitative results
Although the effects of mineral deficiency can usually be seen 
simply by looking at the wheat seedlings, it is better if actual 
measurements are made.

The height of the shoot, or the total length of all the leaves on 

one plant, can be measured. The total root length can also be 
measured, though this is diffi cult if root growth is profuse.

Alternatively, the dry weight of the shoots and roots can be

plants from the different solutions. The shoots are then dried at 
110 °C for 24 hours and weighed. The same procedure can be 
carried out for the roots.

measured. In this case, it is best to pool the results of several 
experiments. All the shoots from the complete culture are placed 
in a labelled container; all those from the ‘no nitrate’ culture 

You would expect the roots and shoots from the complete 
culture to weigh more than those from the nutrient-defi cient 
cultures.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 6 you should know and understand the 
following:

•  Photosynthesis is the way plants make their food.
•  They combine carbon dioxide and water to make sugar.
•  To do this, they need energy from sunlight, which is absorbed 

by chlorophyll.

•  Chlorophyll converts light energy to chemical energy.
•  The word equation to represent photosynthesis is

carbon dioxide + water  light energy
chlorophyll

 glucose + oxygen

•  Plant leaves are adapted for the process of photosynthesis by 

being broad and thin, with many chloroplasts in their cells.
•  From the sugar made by photosynthesis, a plant can make 
all the other substances it needs, provided it has a supply of 
mineral salts like nitrates.

•  In daylight, respiration and photosynthesis will be taking 
place in a leaf; in darkness, only respiration will be taking 
place.

•  In daylight, a plant will be taking in carbon dioxide and giving 

out oxygen.

•  In darkness, a plant will be taking in oxygen and giving out 

carbon dioxide.

•  Experiments to test photosynthesis are designed to exclude 

light, or carbon dioxide, or chlorophyll, to see if the plant can 
still produce starch.

•  A starch test can be carried out to test if photosynthesis has 

occurred in a leaf.

•  Leaves have a structure which adapts them for 

photosynthesis.

•  Plants need a supply of nitrate ions to make protein and 

magnesium ions to make chlorophyll.

•  The balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is

6CO2   + 6H2O  light energy
chlorophyll

 C6H12O6 + 6O2

•  The rate of photosynthesis may be restricted by light 
intensity and temperature. These are ‘limiting factors’.

•  Glasshouses can be used to create optimal conditions for 

photosynthesis.

•  Nitrate ions are needed to make proteins; magnesium ions 

are needed to make chlorophyll.

The need for food
All living organisms need food. An important 
difference between plants and animals is that green 
plants can make food in their leaves but animals have 
to take it in ‘ready-made’ by eating plants or the 
bodies of other animals. In all plants and animals, 
food is used as follows:

For growth
It provides the substances needed for making new 
cells and tissues.

As a source of energy
Energy is required for the chemical reactions 
that take place in living organisms to keep 
them alive. When food is broken down during 
respiration (see Chapter 12), the energy from 
the food is used for chemical reactions such as 
building complex molecules (Chapter 4). In 
animals the energy is also used for activities such 
as movement, the heart beat and nerve impulses. 
Mammals and birds use energy to maintain their 
body temperature.

For replacement of worn and damaged 
tissues
The substances provided by food are needed to 
replace the millions of our red blood cells that 
break down each day, to replace the skin that is 
worn away and to repair wounds.

●l Diet
Balanced diets
A balanced diet must contain enough carbohydrates 
and fats to meet our energy needs. It must also contain 
enough protein of the right kind to provide the essential 
amino acids to make new cells and tissues for growth or 
repair. The diet must also contain vitamins and mineral 
salts, plant fi bre and water. The composition of four 
food samples is shown in Figure 7.1.

to its source and the method of preservation and cooking. ‘White fi sh’ 
(e.g. cod, haddock, plaice) contains only 0.5% fat whereas herring and 
mackerel contain up to 14%. White bread contains only 2–3% fi bre. 
Frying the food greatly adds to its fat content.

Energy requirements
Energy can be obtained from carbohydrates, fats and 
proteins. The cheapest energy-giving food is usually 
carbohydrate; the greatest amount of energy is 
available in fats; proteins give about the same energy 
as carbohydrates but are expensive. Whatever mixture 
of carbohydrate, fat and protein makes up the diet, 
the total energy must be sufficient:
l  to keep our internal body processes working 

(e.g. heart beating, breathing action)
l  to keep up our body temperature, and
l  to meet the needs of work and other activities.
The amount of energy that can be obtained from 
food is measured in calories or joules. One gram  
of carbohydrate or protein can provide us with  
16 or 17 kJ (kilojoules). A gram of fat can give 
37 kJ. We need to obtain about 12 000 kJ of energy 
each day from our food. Table 7.1 shows how this 
figure is obtained. However, the figure will vary 
greatly according to our age, occupation and activity 
(Figure 7.2). It is fairly obvious that a person who 
does hard manual work, such as digging, will use 
more energy than someone who sits in an office. 
Similarly, someone who takes part in a lot of sport 
will need more energy input than someone who 
doesn’t do much physical exercise. 

Females tend to have lower energy requirements 

than males. Two reasons for this are that females 
have, on average, a lower body mass than males, 
which has a lower demand on energy intake, and 
there are also different physical demands made on 
boys and girls. However, an active female may well 
have a higher energy requirement than an inactive 
male of the same age.

As children grow, the energy requirement increases 
because of the energy demands of the growth process 
and the extra energy associated with maintaining 
their body temperature. However, metabolism, and 
therefore energy demands, tends to slow down with 
age once we become adults due to a progressive loss 
of muscle tissue.

maintains the circulation, breathing, body 
temperature, brain function and essential chemical 
processes in the liver and other organs.

If the diet includes more food than is needed to 
supply the energy demands of the body, the surplus 
food is stored either as glycogen in the liver or as fat 
below the skin and in the abdomen.

In 2006, the Food Standards Agency in Britain 

recommended that, for a balanced diet, 50% of our 
energy intake should be made up of carbohydrate, 
35% of fat (with not more than 11% saturated fat) 
and the remaining percentage made up of fibre.

Protein requirements
Proteins are an essential part of the diet because they 
supply the amino acids needed to build up our own 
body structures. Estimates of how much protein 
we need have changed over the last few years. A 
recent WHO/FAO/UNU report recommended 
that an average person needs 0.57 g protein for every 
kilogram of body weight. That is, a 70 kg person 
would need 70 × 0.57 = 39.9, i.e. about 40 g protein 
per day. 

This could be supplied by about 200 g (7 ounces) 
lean meat or 500 g bread but 2 kg potatoes would be 
needed to supply this much protein and even this will 
not contain all the essential amino acids.

Vegetarian and vegan diets
There is relatively less protein in food derived from 
plants than there is in animal products. Vegetarians 
and semi-vegetarians, who include dairy products, 
eggs and possibly fish in their diets, will obtain 
sufficient protein to meet their needs (Table 7.2). 
However, some vegetarian foods now contain 
relatively high proportions of protein: Quorn 
products (made from mycoprotein – derived from 

87

8/18/14   9:45 PM

 7  Human nutrition

fungi) typically contain 14.5 g protein per 100 g, 
compared with 18.0 g protein per 100 g for beef 
sausage, and they do not contain animal fats. Vegans, 
who eat no animal products, need to ensure that their 
diets include a good variety of cereals, peas, beans 
and nuts in order to obtain all the essential amino 
acids to build their body proteins.
Special needs
Pregnancy
A pregnant woman who is already receiving an 
adequate diet needs no extra food. Her body’s 
metabolism will adapt to the demands of the growing 
baby although the demand for energy and protein 
does increase. If, however, her diet is deficient in 
protein, calcium, iron, vitamin D or folic acid, she 
will need to increase her intake of these substances to 
meet the needs of the baby. The baby needs protein 
for making its tissues, calcium and vitamin D are 
needed for bone development, and iron is used to 
make the haemoglobin in its blood.

Lactation
‘Lactation’ means the production of breast milk for 
feeding the baby. The production of milk, rich in 
proteins and minerals, makes a large demand on the 
mother’s resources. If her diet is already adequate, 
her metabolism will adjust to these demands. 
Otherwise, she may need to increase her intake of 
proteins, vitamins and calcium to produce milk of 
adequate quality and quantity.

Growing children
Most children up to the age of about 12 years 
need less food than adults, but they need more in 
proportion to their body weight. For example, an 
adult may need 0.57 g protein per kg body weight, 
but a 6–11-month baby needs 1.85 g per kg and a 
10-year-old child needs 1.0 g per kg for growth. In 
addition, children need extra calcium for growing 
bones, iron for their red blood cells, vitamin D to help 
calcify their bones and vitamin A for disease resistance.
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is often taken to mean simply not 
getting enough food, but it has a much wider 
meaning than this, including getting too much food 
or the wrong sort of food.

If the total intake of food is not sufficient to 

meet the body’s need for energy, the body tissues 

themselves are broken down to provide the energy 
to stay alive. This leads to loss of weight, muscle 
wastage, weakness and ultimately starvation. 
Extreme slimming diets, such as those that avoid 
carbohydrate foods, can result in the disease anorexia 
nervosa.

Coronary heart disease can occur when the diet 
contains too much fat (see ‘Heart’ in Chapter 9). 
Deposits of a fatty substance build up in the arteries, 
reducing the diameter of these blood vessels, 
including the coronary artery. Blood clots are then 
more likely to form. Blood supply to the heart can 
be reduced resulting in angina (chest pains when 
exercising or climbing stairs, for example) and 
eventually a coronary heart attack.

If food intake is drastically inadequate, it is likely 

that the diet will also be deficient in proteins, 
minerals and vitamins so that deficiency diseases 
such as anaemia, rickets and scurvy also make an 
appearance. Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C 
(ascorbic acid) in the diet. Vitamin C is present in 
citrus fruit such as lemons, blackcurrants, tomatoes, 
fresh green vegetables and potatoes. It is not 
unusual for people in developed countries who rely 
on processed food such as tinned products, rather 
than eating fresh produce, to suffer from scurvy. 
Symptoms of scurvy include bleeding under the 
skin, swollen and bleeding gums and poor healing 
of wounds. The victims of malnutrition due to food 
deficiencies such as those mentioned above will 
also have reduced resistance to infectious diseases 
such as malaria or measles. Thus, the symptoms of 
malnutrition are usually the outcome of a variety of 
causes, but all resulting from an inadequate diet.

The causes of malnutrition can be famine due to 
drought or flood, soil erosion, wars, too little land for 
too many people, ignorance of proper dietary needs 
but, above all, poverty. Malnourished populations 
are often poor and cannot afford to buy enough 
nutritious food.

World food
The world population doubled in the last 30 years 
but food production, globally, rose even faster. The 
‘Green Revolution’ of the 1960s greatly increased 
global food production by introducing high-yielding 
varieties of crops. However, these varieties needed a 
high input of fertiliser and the use of pesticides, so 
only the wealthy farmers could afford to use them. 
Moreover, since 1984, the yields are no longer rising 

88

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_7.indd   88

8/18/14   9:45 PM

It is estimated that, despite the global increase 
in food production, 15% of the world population 
is undernourished and 180 million children are 
underweight (Figure 7.4).

There are no obvious, easy or universal solutions 

fast enough to feed the growing population or keep 
pace with the loss of farmland due to erosion and 
urbanisation.

to this situation. Genetically modified crops (see 
‘Genetic engineering’ in Chapter 20) may hold 
out some hope but they are some way off. There is 
resistance to their introduction in some countries 
because of concerns about their safety, gene transfer 
to wild plants or animals, the creation of allergies, 
the cost of seed and, with some GM seed, the 
necessity to buy particular pesticides to support 
them. Redistribution of food from the wealthy to the 
poorer countries is not a practical proposition except 
in emergencies, and the process can undermine local 
economies.

The strategies adopted need to be tailored to the 

needs and climate of individual countries. Crops 
suited to the region should be grown. Millet and 
sorghum grow far better in dry regions than do 
rice or wheat and need little or no irrigation. Cash 
crops such as coffee, tea or cotton can earn foreign 
currency but have no food value and do not feed 
the local population. There has been a surge in the 
production of palm oil (Figure 7.3) due to world 
demand for the product as a biofuel as well as for 
food manufacture. This has resulted in deforestation 
to provide land to grow the crop and is putting 
endangered species at risk of extinction. Countries 
such as Indonesia and Malaysia have been particularly 

Diet

affected. Where cash crops are grown, it might be 
better to use the land, where suitable, to cultivate 
food crops.

Figure 7.3  A new palm oil plantation, replacing a rainforest 

The agricultural practices need to be sustainable 
and not result in erosion. Nearly one-third of the 
world’s crop-growing land has had to be abandoned 
in the last 40 years because erosion has made it 
unproductive. Over-irrigation can also cause a build-
up in soil salinity, making the land effectively sterile 
due to the osmotic problems the salt creates (see 
‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3). Conservation of land, water 
and energy is essential for sustainable agriculture. A 
reduction in the growth of the world’s population, if 
it could be achieved, would have a profound effect in 
reducing malnutrition.

Apart from the measures outlined above, lives 

could be saved by such simple and inexpensive 
steps as provision of regular vitamin and mineral 
supplements. It is estimated that about 30 million 
children are deficient in vitamin A. This deficiency 
leads to blindness and death if untreated.

 7  Human nutrition

Western diets
In the affl uent societies, e.g. USA and Europe, there 
is no general shortage of food and most people can 
afford a diet with an adequate energy and protein 
content. So, few people are undernourished. Eating 
too much food or food of the ‘wrong’ sort, however, 
leads to malnutrition of a different kind.

Refi ned sugar (sucrose)
This is a very concentrated source of energy. You 
can absorb a lot of sugar from biscuits, ice-cream, 
sweets, soft drinks, tinned fruits and sweet tea 
without ever feeling ‘full up’. So you tend to take in 
more sugar than your body needs, which may lead 
to you becoming overweight or obese. The food 
industry has been urged to reduce the sugar content 
of its products to help curb the increase in obesity in 
countries like Great Britain and America.

Sugar is also a major cause of tooth decay (see 

‘Mechanical digestion’). 

Fats
Fatty deposits, called ‘plaques’, in the arteries can 
lead to coronary heart disease and strokes (see 
‘Heart’ in Chapter 9). These plaques are formed 
from lipids and cholesterol combined with proteins 
(low density lipoproteins or LDLs). Although the 
liver makes LDLs, there is evidence to suggest that a 
high intake of fats, particularly animal fats, helps raise 
the level of LDLs in the blood and increase the risk 
of plaque formation.

Most animal fats are formed from saturated fatty 
acids, so called because of their molecular structure. 
Plant oils are formed from unsaturated fatty acids 
(polyunsaturates) and are thought less likely to 
cause fatty plaques in the arteries. For this reason, 
vegetable fats and certain margarines are considered, 
by some nutritionists, to be healthier than butter and 
cream. However, there is still much debate about the 
evidence for this.

Fibre
Many of the processed foods in Western diets contain 
too little fi bre. White bread, for example, has had 
the fi bre (bran) removed. A lack of fi bre can result 
in constipation (see ‘Classes of food’). Unprocessed 
foods, such as unskinned potatoes, vegetables and 
fruit, contain plenty of fi bre. Food rich in fi bre is 
usually bulky and makes you feel ‘full up’ so that 
you are unlikely to overeat. Fibre enables the process 

90

of peristalsis (Figure 7.14) to move food through 
the gut more effi ciently and may also protect the 
intestines from cancer and other disorders. As 
explained later, fi bre helps prevent constipation.
Overweight and obesity
These are different degrees of the same disorder. 
If you take in more food than your body needs 
for energy, growth and replacement, the excess is 
converted to fat and stored in fat deposits under the 
skin or in the abdomen.

Obese people are more likely to suffer from 

high blood pressure, coronary heart disease (see 
the previous section on malnutrition) and diabetes 
(Chapter 14). Having extra weight to carry also 
makes you reluctant to take exercise. By measuring 
a person’s height and body mass, it is possible to use 
a chart to predict whether or not they have an ideal 
body mass (Figure 7.5).

Why some people should be prone to obesity 

is unclear. There may be a genetic predisposition, 
in which the brain centre that responds to food 
intake may not signal when suffi cient food has been 
taken in; in some cases it may be the outcome of an 
infectious disease. Whatever the cause, the remedy is 
to reduce food intake to a level that matches but does 
not exceed the body’s needs. Taking exercise helps, 
but it takes a great deal of exercise to ‘burn off’ even 
a small amount of surplus fat.

Classes of food
There are three classes of food: carbohydrates, 
proteins and fats. The chemical structure of these 
substances is described in Chapter 4. In addition 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_7.indd   90

8/18/14   9:45 PM

to proteins, carbohydrates and fats, the diet must 
include salts, vitamins, water and vegetable fi bre 
(roughage). These substances are present in a 
balanced diet and do not normally have to be taken 
in separately. A summary of the three classes of food 
and their sources is shown in Table 7.3.

Carbohydrates
Sugar and starch are important carbohydrates in 
our diet. Starch is abundant in potatoes, bread, 
maize, rice and other cereals. Sugar appears in 
our diet mainly as sucrose (table sugar) which is 
added to drinks and many prepared foods such as 
jam, biscuits and cakes. Glucose and fructose are 
sugars that occur naturally in many fruits and some 
vegetables.

Although all foods provide us with energy, 

carbohydrates are the cheapest and most readily 
available source of energy. They contain the elements 
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (e.g. glucose is 
C6H12O6). When carbohydrates are oxidised to 
provide energy by respiration they are broken down 
to carbon dioxide and water (Chapter 12). One 
gram of carbohydrate can provide, on average, 
16 kilojoules (kJ) of energy (see practical work 
‘Energy from food’, p. 95). 

If we eat more carbohydrates than we need for 

our energy requirements, the excess is converted in 
the liver to either glycogen or fat. The glycogen is 
stored in the liver and muscles; the fat is stored in fat 
deposits in the abdomen, round the kidneys or under 
the skin (Figure 7.6).

The cellulose in the cell walls of all plant tissues 

is a carbohydrate. We probably derive relatively little 
nourishment from cellulose but it is important in 
the diet as ﬁ bre, which helps to maintain a healthy 
digestive system.

Fats
Animal fats are found in meat, milk, cheese, butter 
and egg-yolk. Plant fats occur as oils in fruits (e.g. 
palm oil) and seeds (e.g. sunfl ower seed oil), and are 
used for cooking and making margarine. Fats and oils 
are sometimes collectively called lipids.

Lipids are used in the cells of the body to form part 

of the cell membrane and other membrane systems. 
Lipids can also be oxidised in respiration, to carbon 
dioxide and water. When used to provide energy in 
this way, 1 g fat gives 37 kJ of energy. This is more 
than twice as much energy as can be obtained from 
the same weight of carbohydrate or protein.

Fats can be stored in the body, so providing a means 
of long-term storage of energy in fat deposits. The 
fatty tissue, adipose tissue, under the skin forms a 
layer that, if its blood supply is restricted, can reduce 
heat losses from the body.

Proteins
Lean meat, fi sh, eggs, milk and cheese are important 
sources of animal protein. All plants contain some 
protein, but soybeans, seeds such as pumpkin, and 
nuts are the best sources (see Table 7.2).

 7  Human nutrition

Proteins, when digested, provide the chemical 
substances needed to build cells and tissues, e.g. skin, 
muscle, blood and bones. Neither carbohydrates 
nor fats can do this so it is essential to include some 
proteins in the diet.

Protein molecules consist of long chains of 

amino acids (see Chapter 4). When proteins are 
digested, the molecules are broken up into the 
constituent amino acids. The amino acids are 
absorbed into the bloodstream and used to build 
up different proteins. These proteins form part of 
the cytoplasm and enzymes of cells and tissues. 
Such a rearrangement of amino acids is shown in 
Figure 7.7.

The amino acids that are not used for making new 
tissues cannot be stored, but the liver removes their 
amino (—NH2) groups and changes the residue to 
glycogen. The glycogen can be stored or oxidised to 
provide energy (Chapter 12). One gram of protein 
can provide 17 kJ of energy.

Chemically, proteins differ from both 

carbohydrates and fats because they contain 
nitrogen and sometimes sulfur as well as carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen.

Vitamins
All proteins are similar to each other in their chemical 
structure, as are all carbohydrates. Vitamins, on the 
other hand, are a group of organic substances quite 
unrelated to each other in their chemical structure. 

The features shared by all vitamins are:

l  They are not digested or broken down for energy.
l  Mostly, they are not built into the body structures.
l  They are essential in small quantities for health.
l  They are needed for chemical reactions in the cells, 

working in association with enzymes.

Plants can make these vitamins in their leaves, but 
animals have to obtain many of them ready-made 
either from plants or from other animals.

If any one of the vitamins is missing or defi cient 

in the diet, a vitamin-defi ciency disease may develop. 
Such a disease can be cured, at least in the early 
stages, simply by adding the vitamin to the diet.

Fifteen or more vitamins have been identifi ed and 
they are sometimes grouped into two classes: water-
soluble and fat-soluble. The fat-soluble vitamins are 
found mostly in animal fats or vegetable oils, which is 
one reason why our diet should include some of these 
fats. The water-soluble vitamins are present in green 
leaves, fruits and cereal grains.

See Table 7.4 for details of vitamins C and D.

Salts
These are sometimes called ‘mineral salts’ or just 
‘minerals’. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats provide 
the body with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
sulfur and phosphorus but there are several more 
elements that the body needs and which occur as salts 
in the food we eat.

Diet

Iron
Red blood cells contain the pigment haemoglobin (see 
‘Blood’ in Chapter 9). Part of the haemoglobin molecule 
contains iron and this plays an important role in carrying 
oxygen around the body. Millions of red cells break 
down each day and their iron is stored by the liver and 
used to make more haemoglobin. However, some iron 
is lost and needs to be replaced through dietary intake.
Red meat, especially liver and kidney, is the richest 

source of iron in the diet, but eggs, groundnuts, 
wholegrains such as brown rice, spinach and other 
green vegetables are also important sources.

If the diet is deficient in iron, a person may suffer 

from some form of anaemia. Insufficient haemoglobin 
is made and the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood 
is reduced.
Calcium
Calcium, in the form of calcium phosphate, is 
deposited in the bones and the teeth and makes 
them hard. It is present in blood plasma and plays an 
essential part in normal blood clotting (see ‘Blood’ in 
Chapter 9). Calcium is also needed for the chemical 
changes that make muscles contract and for the 
transmission of nerve impulses.

The richest sources of calcium are milk (liquid, 

skimmed or dried) and cheese, but calcium is present in 
most foods in small quantities and also in ‘hard’ water.

Many calcium salts are not soluble in water and 

may pass through the alimentary canal without being 
absorbed. Simply increasing the calcium in the diet 
may not have much effect unless the calcium is in 
the right form, the diet is balanced and the intestine 
is healthy. Vitamin D and bile salts are needed for 
efficient absorption of calcium.

Dietary fibre (roughage)
When we eat vegetables and other fresh plant 
material, we take in a large quantity of plant cells. 

The cell walls of plants consist mainly of cellulose, 
but we do not have enzymes for digesting this 
substance. The result is that the plant cell walls reach 
the large intestine (colon) without being digested. 
This undigested part of the diet is called fibre or 
roughage. The colon contains many bacteria that 
can digest some of the substances in the plant cell 
walls to form fatty acids (Chapter 4). Vegetable fibre, 
therefore, may supply some useful food material, but 
it has other important functions.

The fibre itself and the bacteria, which multiply 

from feeding on it, add bulk to the contents of 
the colon and help it to retain water. This softens 
the faeces and reduces the time needed for the 
undigested residues to pass out of the body. Both 
effects help to prevent constipation and keep the 
colon healthy.

Most vegetables and whole cereal grains contain 

fibre, but white flour and white bread do not contain 
much. Good sources of dietary fibre are vegetables, 
fruit and wholemeal bread.

Water
About 70% of most tissue consists of water; it is an 
essential part of cytoplasm. The body fluids, blood, 
lymph and tissue fluid (Chapter 9) are composed 
mainly of water.

Digested food, salts and vitamins are carried 

around the body as a watery solution in the blood 
(Chapter 9) and excretory products such as excess salt 
and urea are removed from the body in solution by 
the kidneys (Chapter 13). Water thus acts as a solvent 
and as a transport medium for these substances.

Digestion is a process that uses water in a chemical 

reaction to break down insoluble substances to 
soluble ones. These products then pass, in solution, 
into the bloodstream. In all cells there are many 
reactions in which water plays an essential part as a 
reactant and a solvent.

Diseases and symptoms caused by lack of 
vitamin
Fibres in connective tissue of skin and blood vessels 
do not form properly, leading to bleeding under 
the skin, particularly at the joints, swollen, bleeding 
gums and poor healing of wounds. These are all 
symptoms of scurvy (Figure 7.8).
Calcium is not deposited properly in the bones, 
causing rickets in young children. The bones 
remain soft and are deformed by the child’s weight 
(Figure 7.9).
Deficiency in adults causes osteo-malacia; 
fractures are likely.

Notes

Possibly acts as a catalyst in cell respiration. Scurvy is 
only likely to occur when fresh food is not available. 
Cows’ milk and milk powders contain little ascorbic 
acid so babies may need additional sources. Cannot 
be stored in the body; daily intake needed.
Vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium from 
the intestine and the deposition of calcium salts 
in the bones.
Natural fats in the skin are converted to a form of 
vitamin D by sunlight.

adequate. Treatment involves provision of an 
energy-rich, balanced diet, but the complications 
of the disorder, which may include infections 
and dehydration, also need attention to increase 
chances of survival and recovery.

Causes and effects of mineral and 
vitamin deﬁ ciencies
 Iron
Iron is present in red meat, eggs, nuts, brown rice, 
shellfi sh, soybean fl our, dried fruit such as apricots, 
spinach and other dark-green leafy vegetables. 
Lack of iron in the diet can lead to iron-defi ciency 
anaemia, which is a decrease in the number of red 
blood cells. Red blood cells, when mature, have no 
nucleus and this limits their life to about 3 months, 
after which they are broken down in the liver and 
replaced. Most of the iron is recycled, but some 
is lost as a chemical called bilirubin in the faeces 
and needs to be replaced. Adults need to take in 
about 15 mg each day. Without suffi cient iron, your 
body is unable to produce enough haemoglobin, 
the protein in red blood cells responsible for 
transporting oxygen to respiring tissues. Iron is also 
needed by the muscles and for enzyme systems in all 
the body cells. The symptoms of anaemia are feeling 
weak, tired and irritable.
 Vitamin D
Vitamin D is the only vitamin that the body can 
manufacture, when the skin is exposed to sunlight. 
However, for 6 months of the year (October to 
April), much of western Europe does not receive 
enough UV rays in sunlight to make vitamin D in 
the skin. So, many people living there are at risk of 
not getting enough vitamin D unless they get it in 
their diet. Also, people who have darker skin, such 
as people of African, African-Caribbean and South 
Asian origin, are at risk because their skin reduces 
UV light absorption.

Vitamin D helps in the absorption of calcium and 
phosphorus through the gut wall. Bone is made of 
the mineral calcium phosphate. A lack of the vitamin 
therefore results in poor calcium and phosphorus 

Foods that provide vitamin D include oily fi sh 

such as sardines and mackerel, fi sh liver oil, butter, 
milk, cheese and egg-yolk. In addition, many 
manufactured food products contain vitamin D 
supplements. 

Figure 7.8  Symptoms of scurvy 

 Kwashiorkor
Kwashiorkor (roughly = ‘deposed child’) is an 
example of protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) 
in the developing world. When a mother has 
her second baby, the fi rst baby is weaned on to a 
starchy diet of yam, cassava or sweet potato, all 
of which have inadequate protein. The fi rst baby 
then develops symptoms of kwashiorkor (dry 
skin, pot-belly, changes to hair colour, weakness 
and irritability). Protein defi ciency is not the only 
cause of kwashiorkor. Infection, plant toxins, 
digestive failure or even psychological effects may 
be involved. The good news, however, is that it can 
often be cured or prevented by an intake of protein 
in the form of dried skimmed milk.
 Marasmus
The term ‘marasmus’ is derived from a Greek 
word, meaning decay. It is an acute form of 
malnutrition. The condition is due to a very poor 
diet with inadequate carbohydrate intake as well 
as a lack of protein. The incidence of marasmus 
increases in babies until they reach the age of 12 
months. Sufferers are extremely emaciated with 
reduced fat and muscle tissue. Their skin is thin 
and hangs in folds. Marasmus is distinguished 
from kwashiorkor because kwashiorkor is due 
to lack of protein intake, while energy intake is

deposition in bones, 
leading to softening. The 
weight of the body can 
deform bones in the legs, 
causing the condition 
called rickets in children 
(Figure 7.9). Adults 
defi cient in vitamin D can 
suffer from osteo-malacia; 
they are very vulnerable 
to fracturing bones if 
they fall.

n  Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 7.10. 
n  Use a measuring cylinder to place 20 cm3 cold water in the 

boiling tube. 

n  With a thermometer, fi nd the temperature of the water and 

make a note of it. 

n  Weigh a peanut (or other piece of dried food), secure it onto 

a mounted needle and heat it with the Bunsen ﬂ ame until 
it begins to burn. Note: make sure that no students have 
nut allergies.

n  As soon as it starts burning, hold the nut under the boiling 

tube so that the ﬂ ames heat the water. 

n  If the ﬂ ame goes out, do not apply the Bunsen burner to 
the food while it is under the boiling tube, but return the 
nut to the Bunsen ﬂ ame to start the nut burning again 
and replace it beneath the boiling tube as soon as the nut 
catches alight. 

n  When the nut has fi nished burning and cannot be ignited 

again, gently stir the water in the boiling tube with the 
thermometer and record its new temperature.

n  Calculate the rise in temperature by subtracting the fi rst from

n  Work out the quantity of energy transferred to the water from 

the burning peanut as follows:

4.2 J raise 1 g water by 1 °C
20 cm3 cold water weighs 20 g
The energy (in joules) released by the burning nut = 
rise in temperature × mass of water × 4.2 

Note: The value 4.2 in the equation is used to convert the 
answer from calories to joules, as the calorie is an obsolete unit.

n  To calculate the energy from 1 g of nut, divide your answer by 

the mass of nut you used. This gives a value in J g−1.

n  The experiment can now be repeated using different sizes 
of nut, or different varieties of nut, or other types of food. 
Remember to replace the warm water in the boiling tube with 
20 cm3 cold water each time.

n  The experiment is quite inaccurate: compare the value you 

obtained with an offi cial value (2385 kJ per 100 g). There 
are plenty of websites with this sort of information if you 
use different nuts or other food. To make the comparison 
you may need to convert your energy value from joules to 
kilojoules (divide by 1000) and to 100 g of the food (multiply 
by 100).

n  Try to list some of the faults in the design of the experiment to 
account for the difference you fi nd. Where do you think some 
of the heat is going? Can you suggest ways of reducing this 
loss to make the results more accurate?

●l Alimentary canal
Key deﬁ nitions
Ingestion is the taking of substances such as food and drink 

into the body through the mouth.

Mechanical digestion is the breakdown of food into smaller 

pieces without chemical change to the food molecules.

Chemical digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble 

molecules into small soluble molecules.

Absorption is the movement of small food molecules and ions 

through the wall of the intestine into the blood.

Assimilation is the movement of digested food molecules into 
the cells of the body where they are used, becoming part 
of the cells.

Egestion is the passing out of food that has not been digested 

or absorbed, as faeces, through the anus.

Feeding involves taking food into the mouth, 
chewing it and swallowing it down into the 
stomach. This satisfi es our hunger, but for food 
to be of any use to the whole body it has fi rst to 
be digested. This means that the solid food is 
dissolved and the molecules reduced in size. The 
soluble products then have to be absorbed into the 
bloodstream and carried by the blood all around the 

95

8/18/14   9:45 PM

alimentary canal (Figure 7.12). The salivary glands 
and the pancreas (see Figure 7.13) are examples of 
such digestive glands.

The alimentary canal has a great many blood 

vessels in its walls, close to the lining. These bring 
oxygen needed by the cells and take away the carbon 
dioxide they produce. They also absorb the digested 
food from the alimentary canal.

body. In this way, the blood delivers dissolved food 
to the living cells in all parts of the body such as 
the muscles, brain, heart and kidneys. This section 
describes how the food is digested and absorbed. 
Chapter 9 describes how the blood carries it around 
the body.
Regions of the alimentary canal and 
their functions
The alimentary canal is a tube running through 
the body. Food is digested in the alimentary 
canal. The soluble products are absorbed and 
the indigestible residues expelled (egested). A 
simplifi ed diagram of an alimentary canal is shown 
in Figure 7.11.

Figure 7.11  The alimentary canal (generalised) 

The inside of the alimentary canal is lined with 
layers of cells forming what is called an epithelium. 
New cells in the epithelium are being produced 
all the time to replace the cells worn away by the 
movement of the food. There are also cells in the 
lining that produce mucus. Mucus is a slimy liquid 
that lubricates the lining of the canal and protects 
it from wear and tear. Mucus may also protect the 
lining from attack by the digestive enzymes which 
are released into the alimentary canal.

Some of the digestive enzymes are produced by 
cells in the lining of the alimentary canal, as in the 
stomach lining. Others are produced by glands 
that are outside the alimentary canal but pour their 
enzymes through tubes (called ducts) into the 

96

Figure 7.12  The general structure of the alimentary canal

Five main processes associated with digestion occur in 
the alimentary canal. These are ingestion, digestion, 
absorption, assimilation and egestion. The main parts 
of the alimentary canal are shown in Figure 7.13. An 
outline of the functions of its main parts is given in 
Table 7.5.

Peristalsis
The alimentary canal has layers of muscle in its walls 
(Figure 7.12). The fi bres of one layer of muscles run 
around the canal (circular muscle) and the others 
run along its length (longitudinal muscle). When 
the circular muscles in one region contract, they 
make the alimentary canal narrow in that region.
A contraction in one region of the alimentary 

canal is followed by another contraction just below 
it so that a wave of contraction passes along the 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_7.indd   96

contraction, called peristalsis, is illustrated in 
Figure 7.14.

Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is the loss of watery faeces. It is sometimes 
caused by bacterial or viral infection, for example 
from food or water. Once infected, the lining of 
the digestive system is damaged by the pathogens, 
resulting in the intestines being unable to absorb 
fl uid from the contents of the colon or too much 
fl uid being secreted into the colon. Undigested food 
then moves through the large intestine too quickly, 
resulting in insuffi cient time to absorb water from it. 
Unless the condition is treated, dehydration can occur.

Treatment is known as oral hydration therapy. 
This involves drinking plenty of fl uids – sipping small 
amounts of water at a time to rehydrate the body. 

Other possible causes of diarrhoea include anxiety, 

food allergies, lactose intolerance, a side-effect of 
antibiotics and bowel cancer.

Cholera
This disease is caused by the bacterium Vibrio 
cholera which causes acute diarrhoea. Treatment 
involves rehydration and restoration of the salts lost 
(administered by injecting a carefully controlled 
solution into the bloodstream) and use of an 
antibiotic such as tetracycline to kill the bacteria. 
The bacteria thrive in dirty water (often that 
contaminated by sewage) and are transmitted when 
the water is drunk or used to wash food. Long-
term methods of control are to dispose of human 
sewage safely, ensuring that drinking water is free 
from bacteria and preventing food from being 
contaminated.

How cholera causes diarrhoea
When the Vibrio cholera bacteria are ingested, 
they multiply in the small intestine and invade its 
epithelial cells. As the bacteria become embedded, 
they release toxins (poisons) which irritate the 
intestinal lining and lead to the secretion of large 
amounts of water and salts, including chloride ions. 
The salts decrease the osmotic potential of the gut 
contents, drawing more water from surrounding 
tissues and blood by osmosis (see ‘Osmosis’ in 
Chapter 3). This makes the undigested food much 
more watery, leading to acute diarrhoea, and the 
loss of body fl uids and salt leads to dehydration and 
kidney failure.

●l Mechanical digestion
The process of mechanical digestion mainly occurs in 
the mouth by means of the teeth, through a process 
called mastication. 

Humans are omnivores (organisms that eat 

animal and plant material). Broadly, we have the 
same types of teeth as carnivores, but human teeth 
are not used for catching, holding, killing or tearing 
up prey, and we cannot cope with bones. Thus, 

although we have incisors, canines, premolars and 
molars, they do not show such big variations in size 
and shape as, for example, a wolf’s. Figure 7.15 
shows the position of teeth in the upper jaw and 
Figure 7.16 shows how they appear in both jaws 
when seen from the side.

Table 7.6 gives a summary of the types of human 

teeth and their functions.

Our top incisors pass in front of our bottom 

incisors and cut pieces off the food, such as when 
biting into an apple or taking a bite out of a piece 
of toast.

Our canines are more pointed than the incisors 
but are not much larger. They function like extra 
incisors. 

Our premolars and molars are similar in shape 

and function. Their knobbly surfaces, called cusps, 
meet when the jaws are closed, and crush the food 
into small pieces. Small particles of food are easier to 
digest than large chunks.

Tooth structure
The part of a tooth that is visible above the gum line 
is called the crown. The gum is tissue that overlays 
the jaws. The rest, embedded in the jaw bone, is 
called the root (Figure 7.17). The surface of the 
crown is covered by a very hard layer of enamel. 
This layer is replaced by cement in the root, which 
enables the tooth to grip to its bony socket in the 
jaw. Below the enamel is a layer of dentine. Dentine 
is softer than enamel. Inside the dentine is a pulp 
cavity, containing nerves and blood vessels. These 
enter the tooth through a small hole at the base of 
the root.

Dental decay (dental caries)
Decay begins when small holes (cavities) appear 
in the enamel. The cavities are caused by bacteria 
on the tooth surface. The bacteria feed on the 
sugars deposited on the teeth, respiring them and 
producing acid, which dissolves the calcium salts in 
the tooth enamel. The enamel is dissolved away in 

patches, exposing the dentine to the acids. Dentine 
is softer than enamel and dissolves more quickly so 
cavities are formed. The cavities reduce the distance 
between the outside of the tooth and the nerve 
endings. The acids produced by the bacteria irritate 
the nerve endings and cause toothache. If the cavity 
is not cleaned and fi lled by a dentist, the bacteria will 
get into the pulp cavity and cause a painful abscess at 
the root. Often, the only way to treat this is to have 
the tooth pulled out.

Although some people’s teeth are more resistant to 

decay than others, it seems that it is the presence of 
refi ned sugar (sucrose) in the diet that contributes to 
decay.

Western diets contain a good deal of refi ned 

sugar and children suck sweets between one meal 
and the next. The high level of dental decay in 
Western society is thought to be caused mainly by 
keeping sugar in the mouth for long periods of 
time.

The graph in Figure 7.18(a) shows how the pH 
in the mouth falls (i.e. becomes more acid) when 
a single sweet is sucked. The pH below which the 
enamel is attacked is called the critical pH (between 
5.5 and 6). In this case, the enamel is under acid 
attack for about 10 minutes.

The graph in Figure 7.18(b) shows the effect of 
sucking sweets at the rate of four an hour. In this 
case the teeth are exposed to acid attack almost 
continually.

The best way to prevent tooth decay, therefore, is 
to avoid eating sugar at frequent intervals either in 
the form of sweets or in sweet drinks such as orange 
squash or soft (fi zzy) drinks.

It is advisable also to visit the dentist every 

6 months or so for a ‘check-up’ so that any caries or 
gum disease can be treated at an early stage.

Brushing the teeth is very important in the prevention 
of gum disease. It may not be so effective in preventing 
caries, although the use of fluoride toothpaste does 
help to reduce the bacterial population on the teeth 
and to increase their resistance to decay (see below).

l● Extension work
Gum disease (periodontal disease)
There is usually a layer of saliva and mucus over the 
teeth. This layer contains bacteria that live on the 
food residues in the mouth, building up a coating 
on the teeth called plaque. If the plaque is not 
removed, mineral salts of calcium and magnesium 
are deposited on it, forming a hard layer of ‘tartar’ or 
calculus. If the bacterial plaque that forms on teeth 
is not removed regularly, it spreads down the tooth 
into the narrow gap between the gum and enamel. 
Here it causes inflammation, called gingivitis, which 
leads to redness and bleeding of the gums and to bad 
breath. It also causes the gums to recede and expose 
the cement. If gingivitis is not treated, it progresses 
to periodontitis; the fibres holding the tooth in the 
jaw are destroyed, so the tooth becomes loose and 
falls out or has to be pulled out.

There is evidence that cleaning the teeth does 

help to prevent gum disease. It is best to clean the 
teeth about twice a day using a toothbrush. No one 
method of cleaning has proved to be any better 

than any other, but the cleaning should attempt 
to remove all the plaque from the narrow crevice 
between the gums and the teeth. Rinsing the 
mouth regularly with mouthwashes helps reduce the 
number of bacteria residing in the mouth.

Drawing a waxed thread (‘dental floss’) between 

the teeth, or using interdental brushes, helps to 
remove plaque in these regions.
●l Chemical digestion
Digestion is mainly a chemical process and consists 
of breaking down large molecules to small molecules. 
The large molecules are usually not soluble in water, 
while the smaller ones are. The small molecules can 
be absorbed through the epithelium of the alimentary 
canal, through the walls of the blood vessels and into 
the blood.

Some food can be absorbed without digestion. 
The glucose in fruit juice, for example, could pass 
through the walls of the alimentary canal and enter 
the blood vessels without further change. Most 
food, however, is solid and cannot get into blood 
vessels. Digestion is the process by which solid food is 
dissolved to make a solution.

The chemicals that dissolve the food are enzymes, 

described in Chapter 5. A protein might take 50 years to 
dissolve if just placed in water but is completely digested 
by enzymes in a few hours. All the solid starch in foods 
such as bread and potatoes is digested to glucose, which 
is soluble in water. The solid proteins in meat, eggs and 
beans are digested to soluble substances called amino 
acids. Fats are digested to two soluble products called 
glycerol and fatty acids (see Chapter 4).

The chemical breakdown usually takes place in 
stages. For example, the starch molecule is made 
up of hundreds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms. The first stage of digestion breaks it down 
to a 12-carbon sugar molecule called maltose. The 
last stage of digestion breaks the maltose molecule 
into two 6-carbon sugar molecules called glucose 
(Figure 7.19). Protein molecules are digested first 
to smaller molecules called peptides and finally into 
completely soluble molecules called amino acids.

These stages take place in different parts of the 
alimentary canal. The progress of food through the 
canal and the stages of digestion will now be described.

The mouth
The act of taking food into the mouth is called 
ingestion. In the mouth, the food is chewed and 
mixed with saliva. The chewing breaks the food into 
pieces that can be swallowed and it also increases the 
surface area for the enzymes to work on later. Saliva 
is a digestive juice produced by three pairs of glands 
whose ducts lead into the mouth. It helps to lubricate 
the food and make the small pieces stick together. 
Saliva contains one enzyme, salivary amylase 
(sometimes called ptyalin), which acts on cooked 
starch and begins to break it down into maltose.
Strictly speaking, the ‘mouth’ is the aperture 

between the lips. The space inside, containing the 
tongue and teeth, is called the buccal cavity. Beyond 
the buccal cavity is the ‘throat’ or pharynx.
Swallowing
For food to enter the gullet (oesophagus), it has to 
pass over the windpipe. To ensure that food does 
not enter the windpipe and cause choking during 
swallowing, the epiglottis (a fl ap of cartilage) guides 
the food into the gullet.

The beginning of the swallowing action is voluntary, 

but once the food reaches the back of the mouth, 
swallowing becomes an automatic or refl ex action. The 
food is forced into and down the gullet by peristalsis. 
This takes about 6 seconds with relatively solid food; 
the food is then admitted to the stomach. Liquid 
travels more rapidly down the gullet.
The stomach
The stomach has elastic walls, which stretch as the 
food collects in it. The pyloric sphincter is a circular 

band of muscle at the lower end of the stomach that 
stops solid pieces of food from passing through. 
The main function of the stomach is to store the 
food from a meal, turn it into a liquid and release 
it in small quantities at a time to the rest of the 
alimentary canal. An example of physical digestion 
is the peristaltic action of muscles in the wall of 
the stomach. These muscles alternately contract 
and relax, churning and squeezing the food in the 
stomach and mixing it with gastric juice, turning 
the mixture into a creamy liquid called chyme. This 
action gives the food a greater surface area so that it 
can be digested more effi ciently.

Glands in the lining of the stomach (Figure 7.20) 

produce gastric juice containing the protease 
enzyme. It helps in the process of breaking down 
large protein molecules into small, soluble amino 
acids. The stomach lining also produces hydrochloric 
acid, which makes a weak solution in the gastric 
juice. This acid provides the best degree of acidity 
for stomach protease to work in (Chapter 4) and kills 
many of the bacteria taken in with the food.

The regular, peristaltic movements of the stomach, 

about once every 20 seconds, mix up the food and 
gastric juice into a creamy liquid. How long food 
remains in the stomach depends on its nature. 
Water may pass through in a few minutes; a meal of 
carbohydrate such as porridge may be held in the 
stomach for less than an hour, but a mixed meal 
containing protein and fat may be in the stomach for 
1 or 2 hours.

The pyloric sphincter lets the liquid products of 

digestion pass, a little at a time, into the fi rst part of 
the small intestine called the duodenum.

The small intestine
A digestive juice from the pancreas (pancreatic juice) 
and bile from the liver are poured into the duodenum 
to act on food there. The pancreas is a digestive gland 
lying below the stomach (Figure 7.21). It makes a 
number of enzymes, which act on all classes of food. 
Protease breaks down proteins into amino acids. 
Pancreatic amylase attacks starch and converts it to 
maltose. Lipase digests fats (lipids) to fatty acids and 
glycerol.

Figure 7.21  Relationship between stomach, liver and pancreas

Pancreatic juice contains sodium hydrogencarbonate, 
which partly neutralises the acidic liquid from the 
stomach. This is necessary because the enzymes of 
the pancreas do not work well in acid conditions.

All the digestible material is thus changed to 
soluble compounds, which can pass through the 
lining of the intestine and into the bloodstream. The 
final products of digestion are:

 

Food 
starch 
proteins 
fats (lipids) 

 
 
 

Final products
glucose (a simple sugar)
amino acids
fatty acids and glycerol

 Bile
Bile is a green, watery fluid made in the liver, stored 
in the gall-bladder and delivered to the duodenum 
by the bile duct (Figure 7.21). It contains no 
enzymes, but its green colour is caused by bile 
pigments, which are formed from the breakdown of 
haemoglobin in the liver. Bile also contains bile salts, 
which act on fats rather like a detergent. The bile 
salts emulsify the fats. That is, they break them up 
into small droplets with a large surface area, which 
are more efficiently digested by lipase.

Bile is slightly alkaline as it contains sodium 

hydrogencarbonate and, along with pancreatic juice, 
has the function of neutralising the acidic mixture 
of food and gastric juices as it enters the duodenum. 
This is important because enzymes secreted into the 
duodenum need alkaline conditions to work at their 
optimum rate.

 Digestion of protein
There are actually several proteases (or proteinases) 
which break down proteins. One protease is 
pepsin and is secreted in the stomach. Pepsin acts 
on proteins and breaks them down into soluble 
compounds called peptides. These are shorter chains 
of amino acids than proteins. Another protease is 
called trypsin. Trypsin is secreted by the pancreas 
in an inactive form, which is changed to an active 
enzyme in the duodenum. It has a similar role to 
pepsin, breaking down proteins to peptides.

The small intestine itself does not appear to 

produce digestive enzymes. The structure labelled 
‘crypt’ in Figure 7.23 is not a digestive gland, 
though some of its cells do produce mucus and 
other secretions. The main function of the crypts is 
to produce new epithelial cells (see ‘Absorption’) to 
replace those lost from the tips of the villi.

102

8/18/14   9:45 PM

absorption

The epithelial cells of the villi contain enzymes in their 
cell membranes that complete the breakdown of sugars 
and peptides, before they pass through the cells on their 
way to the bloodstream. For example, peptidase breaks 
down polypeptides and peptides into amino acids.

 Digestion of starch
Starch is digested in two places in the alimentary 
canal: by salivary amylase in the mouth and by 
pancreatic amylase in the duodenum. Amylase works 
best in a neutral or slightly alkaline pH and converts 
large, insoluble starch molecules into smaller, soluble 
maltose molecules. Maltose is a disaccharide sugar 

Table 7.7 Principal substances produced by digestion

and is still too big to be absorbed through the wall 
of the intestine. Maltose is broken down to glucose 
by the enzyme maltase, which is present in the 
membranes of the epithelial cells of the villi.

 Functions of hydrochloric acid in 
gastric juice
The hydrochloric acid, secreted by cells in the wall 
of the stomach, creates a very acid pH of 2. This pH 
is important because it denatures enzymes in harmful 
organisms in food, such as bacteria (which may otherwise 
cause food poisoning) and it provides the optimum 
pH for the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin to work.

l● Extension work
Prevention of self-digestion
The gland cells of the stomach and pancreas make 
protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and yet the 
proteins of the cells that make these enzymes are not 
digested. One reason for this is that the proteases are 
secreted in an inactive form. Pepsin is produced as 
pepsinogen and does not become the active enzyme 
until it encounters the hydrochloric acid in the 
stomach. The lining of the stomach is protected from 
the action of pepsin probably by the layer of mucus.
Similarly, trypsin, one of the proteases from the 

pancreas, is secreted as the inactive trypsinogen and 
is activated by enterokinase, an enzyme secreted by 
the lining of the duodenum.

●l Absorption
The small intestine consists of the duodenum and 
the ileum. Nearly all the absorption of digested 
food takes place in the ileum, along with most of the 
water. Small molecules of the digested food such as 

glucose and amino acids pass into the bloodstream, 
while fatty acids and glycerol pass into the lacteals 
(Figure 7.23) connected to the lymphatic system.
The large intestine (colon and rectum)
The material passing into the large intestine consists 
of water with undigested matter, largely cellulose and 
vegetable fibres (roughage), mucus and dead cells 
from the lining of the alimentary canal. The large 
intestine secretes no enzymes but the bacteria in 
the colon digest part of the fibre to form fatty acids, 
which the colon can absorb. Bile salts are absorbed 
and returned to the liver by the blood circulation. 
The colon also absorbs much of the water from the 
undigested residues. About 7 litres of digestive juices 
are poured into the alimentary canal each day. If the 
water from these was not absorbed by the ileum and 
colon, the body would soon become dehydrated.
The semi-solid waste, the faeces or ‘stool’, is 

passed into the rectum by peristalsis and is expelled 
at intervals through the anus. The residues may 
spend from 12 to 24 hours in the intestine. The 
act of expelling the faeces is called egestion or 
defecation.

 7  Human nutrition

The ileum is efficient in the absorption of digested 
food for the following reasons:
• It is fairly long and presents a large absorbing 

surface to the digested food.

• Its internal surface is greatly increased by 

circular folds (Figure 7.22) bearing thousands 
of tiny projections called villi (singular = villus) 
(Figures 7.23 and 7.24). These villi are about 
0.5 mm long and may be finger-like or flattened  
in shape.

• The lining epithelium is very thin and the 

fluids can pass rapidly through it. The outer 
membrane of each epithelial cell has microvilli, 
which increase by 20 times the exposed surface 
of the cell.

• There is a dense network of blood capillaries (tiny 
blood vessels, see ‘Blood and lymphatic vessels’ in 
Chapter 9) in each villus (Figure 7.22).

capillary
network

The small molecules of digested food, for example 
glucose and amino acids, pass into the epithelial 
cells and then through the wall of the capillaries in 
the villus and into the bloodstream. They are then 
carried away in the capillaries, which join up to  
form veins. These veins unite to form one large  
vein, the hepatic portal vein (see Chapter 9).  
This vein carries all the blood from the intestines 
to the liver, which may store or alter any of the 
digestion products. When these products are  
released from the liver, they enter the general  
blood circulation.

Some of the fatty acids and glycerol from the 

digestion of fats enter the blood capillaries of 
the villi. However, a large proportion of the fatty 
acids and glycerol may be combined to form 
fats again in the intestinal epithelium. These 
fats then pass into the lacteals (Figure 7.23). 
The fluid in the lacteals flows into the lymphatic 
system, which forms a network all over the body 
and eventually empties its contents into the 
bloodstream (see ‘Blood and lymphatic vessels’  
in Chapter 9).

Water-soluble vitamins may diffuse into the 

epithelium but fat-soluble vitamins are carried in 
the microscopic fat droplets that enter the cells. The 
ions of mineral salts are probably absorbed by active 
transport. Calcium ions need vitamin D for their 
effective absorption.

are mostly leaf-like (C), but further towards the ileum they become 
narrower (B), and in the ileum they are mostly fi nger-like (A). This 
micrograph is of a region in the duodenum.

Absorption of the products of digestion and other 
dietary items is not just a matter of simple diffusion, 
except perhaps for alcohol and, sometimes, water. 
Although the mechanisms for transport across the 
intestinal epithelium have not been fully worked 
out, it seems likely that various forms of active 
transport are involved. Even water can cross the 
epithelium against an osmotic gradient (Chapter 3). 
Amino acids, sugars and salts are, almost certainly, 
taken up by active transport. Glucose, for example, 
crosses the epithelium faster than fructose (another 
monosaccharide sugar) although their rates of 
diffusion would be about the same.

The epithelial cells of the villi are constantly being 

shed into the intestine. Rapid cell division in the 

absorption

epithelium of the crypts (Figure 7.23) replaces these 
lost cells. In effect there is a steady procession of 
epithelial cells moving up from the crypts to the villi.

Use of digested food
The products of digestion are carried around the 
body in the blood. From the blood, cells absorb and 
use glucose, fats and amino acids. This uptake and 
use of food is called assimilation.
 Glucose
During respiration in the cells, glucose is oxidised to 
carbon dioxide and water (see ‘Aerobic respiration’ 
in Chapter 12). This reaction provides energy to 
drive the many chemical processes in the cells, which 
result in, for example, the building-up of proteins, 
contraction of muscles or electrical changes in nerves.
 Fats
These are built into cell membranes and other cell 
structures. Fats also form an important source of 
energy for cell metabolism. Fatty acids produced 
from stored fats or taken in with the food, are 
oxidised in the cells to carbon dioxide and water. 
This releases energy for processes such as muscle 
contraction. Fats can provide twice as much energy 
as sugars.
 Amino acids
These are absorbed by the cells and built up, with 
the aid of enzymes, into proteins. Some of the 
proteins will become plasma proteins in the blood 
(see ‘Blood’ in Chapter 9). Others may form 
structures such as cell membranes or they may 
become enzymes that control the chemical activity 
within the cell. Amino acids not needed for making 
cell proteins are converted by the liver into glycogen, 
which can then be used for energy.

Results
The contents of tube A fail to give a blue colour with iodine, 
showing that the starch has gone. The other half of the contents, 
however, gives a red or orange precipitate with Benedict’s 
solution, showing that sugar is present.

The contents of tube B still give a blue colour with iodine but 
do not form a red precipitate on heating with Benedict’s solution.

Interpretation
The results with tube A suggest that something in saliva has 
converted starch into sugar. The fact that the boiled saliva in tube 
B fails to do this suggests that it was an enzyme in saliva that 
brought about the change (see Chapter 5), because enzymes 
are proteins and are destroyed by boiling. If the boiled saliva had 
changed starch to sugar, it would have ruled out the possibility of 
an enzyme being responsible.

This interpretation assumes that it is something in saliva that 

changes starch into sugar. However, the results could equally 
well support the claim that starch can turn unboiled saliva into 
sugar. Our knowledge of (1) the chemical composition of starch 
and saliva and (2) the effect of heat on enzymes, makes the first 
interpretation more plausible.

2  Modelling the action of amylase on starch

n  Collect a 15 cm length of Visking tubing which has been 

softened in water. 

n  Tie one end tightly. Use a syringe to introduce 2% starch 
solution into the Visking tubing, to about two thirds full. 

106

n  Add 2 cm3 of 5% amylase solution (or saliva if it is permissible). 
n  Pinch the top of the Visking tubing to keep it closed, before 

carefully mixing its contents by squeezing the tubing. 

n  Rinse the outside of the Visking tubing thoroughly with tap 
water, then place it in a boiling tube, trapping the top of the 
tubing with an elastic band (see Figure 7.26). 

n  Add enough distilled water to cover the Visking tubing. 
n  Test a small sample of the distilled water and the contents of 
the Visking tubing for starch and reducing sugar, using iodine 
solution and Benedict’s solution (see page 58 for methods).
n  Place the boiling tube in a beaker of water or a water bath  

at 37 °C. 

n  After 20 minutes, use clean teat pipettes to remove a sample 
of the water surrounding the Visking tubing and from inside 
the Visking tubing. 

n  Test some of each sample for starch, using iodine solution, and 

for reducing sugar, using Benedict’s solution (see Chapter 4 
for methods). Also test some of the original starch solution 
for reducing sugar, to make sure it is not contaminated with 
glucose.

Figure 7.26  Experiment to model the digestion of starch 

Result
At the start of the investigation the distilled water tests negative 
for starch (stays brown) and reducing sugar (stays turquoise). The 
contents of the Visking tubing are positive for starch (blue-black), 
but negative for reducing sugars (stays turquoise). 

After 20 minutes, the contents of the Visking tubing are 

yellow/brown with iodine solution, but turn orange or brick red 
with Benedict’s solution. The water sample stays yellow/brown 
with iodine solution, but turns orange or brick red with Benedict’s 
solution. 

Interpretation
The amylase digests the starch in the Visking tubing, producing 
reducing sugar. The complete digestion of starch results in a 
negative colour change with iodine solution. The presence of 
reducing sugar (maltose or glucose) causes the Benedict’s solution 
to turn orange or brick red. The reducing sugar molecules can 
diffuse through the Visking tubing into the surrounding water, so 
the water gives a positive result with Benedict’s solution. Starch 
is a large molecule, so it cannot diffuse through the tubing: the 
water gives a negative result with iodine solution.

This model can be used to represent digestion in the gut. The 

starch solution and amylase are the contents of the mouth or

duodenum. The Visking tubing represents the duodenum wall 
and the distilled water represents the bloodstream, into which 
the products of digestion are absorbed.

3  The action of pepsin on egg-white protein
A cloudy suspension of egg-white is prepared by stirring the 
white of one egg into 500 cm3 tap water, heating it to boiling 
point and filtering it through glass wool to remove the larger 
particles.

n  Label four test-tubes A, B, C and D and place 2 cm3 egg-

white suspension in each of them. Then add pepsin solution 
and/or dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the tubes as follows 
(Figure 7.27):

n  Place all four tubes in a beaker of warm water at 35 °C for 

10–15 minutes.

Result
The contents of tube C go clear. The rest remain cloudy.

Interpretation
The change from a cloudy suspension to a clear solution shows 
that the solid particles of egg protein have been digested to 
soluble products. The failure of the other three tubes to give clear 
solutions shows that:

n  pepsin will only work in acid solutions
n  it is the pepsin and not the hydrochloric acid that does the 

digestion

n  pepsin is an enzyme, because its activity is destroyed by 

boiling.

4  The action of lipase

n  Place 5 cm3 milk and 7 cm3 dilute (0.05 mol dm−3) sodium 

carbonate solution into each of three test-tubes labelled 1 to 3 
(Figure 7.28).

n  Add six drops of phenolphthalein to each to turn the contents

Result
In 10 minutes or less, the colour of the liquids in tubes 1 and 3 
will change to white, with tube 3 changing first. The liquid in 
tube 2 will remain pink.

Interpretation
Lipase is an enzyme that digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol. 
When lipase acts on milk fats, the fatty acids that have been 
produced react with the alkaline sodium carbonate and make 
the solution more acid. In acid conditions the pH indicator, 
phenolphthalein, changes from pink to colourless. The presence 
of bile salts in tube 3 seems to speed up the reaction, although 
bile salts with the denatured enzyme in tube 2 cannot bring 
about the change on their own.

For experiments investigating the effect of temperature and pH 

on enzyme action see Chapter 5.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 7 you should know and understand the 
following:
•  A balanced diet must contain proteins, carbohydrates, fats, 

minerals, vitamins, fibre and water, in the correct proportions. 
Dietary needs are affected by the age, gender and activity of 
humans. 

•  Growing children and pregnant women have special dietary 

needs.

•  Malnutrition is the result of taking in food that does not 

match the energy needs of the body, or is lacking in proteins, 
vitamins or minerals.

•  The effects of malnutrition include starvation, coronary heart 

disease, constipation and scurvy.

•  Western diets often contain too much sugar and fat and too 

little fibre.

•  Obesity results from taking in more food than the body needs 

for energy, growth or replacement.

•  Examples of good food sources for the components of a 

balanced diet.

•  Fats, carbohydrates and proteins provide energy.
•  Proteins provide amino acids for the growth and replacement 

of the tissues.

•  Mineral salts like calcium and iron are needed in tissues such 

absorption

•  Shortage of vitamin C causes scurvy; inadequate vitamin D 

causes rickets.

•  Mechanical digestion breaks down food into smaller pieces, 

without any chemical change of the food molecules. This 
process involves teeth, which can become decayed if not 
cared for properly.

•  Chemical digestion is the process that changes large, 
insoluble food molecules into small, soluble molecules.

•  Digestion takes place in the alimentary canal.
•  The changes are brought about by chemicals called digestive 

enzymes.

•  The stomach produces gastric juice, which contains 

hydrochloric acid as well as pepsin.

•  The ileum absorbs amino acids, glucose and fats.
•  These are carried in the bloodstream first to the liver and 

then to all parts of the body.

•  The small intestine and the colon both absorb water.
•  Undigested food is egested through the anus as faeces.
•  Diarrhoea is the loss of watery faeces.
•  Cholera is a disease caused by a bacterium. 

•  Malnutrition includes kwashiorkor and marasmus.
•  Cholera bacteria produce a toxin that affects osmosis in 

the gut.

•  Internal folds, villi and microvilli greatly increase the

•  Vegetable fibre helps to maintain a healthy intestine.
•  Vitamins are essential in small quantities for chemical 

absorbing surface of the small intestine.

•  The villi have a special structure to enable efficient 

absorption of digested food.

●● Extension work
Before looking in detail at leaf, stem and root 
structure, it is useful to consider the relationship 
between these parts and the whole plant. 

A young sycamore plant is shown in Figure 8.1. It 
is typical of many fl owering plants in having a root 
system below the ground and a shoot system above 
ground. The shoot consists of an upright stem, with 
leaves and buds. The buds on the side of the stem 
are called lateral buds. When they grow, they will 
produce branches. The bud at the tip of the shoot is 
the terminal bud and when it grows, it will continue 
the upward growth of the stem. The lateral buds and 
the terminal buds may also produce fl owers.

sinks

The region of stem from which leaves and buds arise 
is called a node. The region of stem between two 
nodes is the internode.

The leaves make food by photosynthesis 

(Chapter 6) and pass it back to the stem.

The stem carries this food to all parts of the plant 
that need it and also carries water and dissolved salts 
from the roots to the leaves and fl owers.

In addition, the stem supports and spaces out the 
leaves so that they can receive sunlight and absorb 
carbon dioxide, which they need for photosynthesis.

An upright stem also holds the fl owers above the 

ground, helping the pollination by insects or the wind 
(see ‘Sexual reproduction in plants’ in Chapter 16). A 
tall stem may help in seed dispersal later on.

The roots anchor the plant in the soil and prevent 

it from falling over or being blown over by the 
wind. They also absorb the water and salts that the 
plant needs for making food in the leaves. A third 
function is sometimes the storage of food made by 
the leaves.

●● Transport in plants
Plant structure and function

Leaf
The structure of a leaf has already been described in 
Chapter 6. Xylem and phloem appear in the midrib of 
the leaf, as well as in the leaf veins. These features are 
identifi ed in Chapter 6, Figures 6.18 and 6.19. 

Stem
Figure 8.2 shows a stem cut across (transversely) and 
down its length (longitudinally) to show its internal 
structure.

these cells are digested away to form a continuous, 
fine tube (Figure 8.4(c)). At the same time, the 
cell walls are thickened and impregnated with a 
substance called lignin, which makes the cell wall 
very strong and impermeable. Since these lignified 
cell walls prevent the free passage of water and 
nutrients, the cytoplasm dies. This does not affect 
the passage of water in the vessels. Xylem also 
contains many elongated, lignified supporting cells 
called fibres.

Sieve tubes
The conducting cells in the phloem remain alive and 
form sieve tubes. Like vessels, they are formed by 
vertical columns of cells (Figure 8.5(b)). Perforations 
appear in the end walls, allowing substances to pass 
from cell to cell, but the cell walls are not lignified 
and the cell contents do not die, although they do 
lose their nuclei. The perforated end walls are called 
sieve plates.

Phloem contains supporting cells as well as sieve 

tubes.

Epidermis
Like the leaf epidermis, this is a single layer of cells 
that helps to keep the shape of the stem and cuts 
down the loss of water vapour. Stomata in the 
epidermis allow the tissues inside to take up oxygen 
and get rid of carbon dioxide. In woody stems, the 
epidermis is replaced by bark, which consists of many 
layers of dead cells.
Vascular bundles
These are made up of groups of specialised cells that 
conduct water, dissolved salts and food up or down 
the stem. The vascular bundles in the roots, stem, leaf 
stalks and leaf veins all connect up to form a transport 
system throughout the entire plant (Figure 8.3). The 
two main tissues in the vascular bundles are called 
xylem and phloem (Figure 8.4). Food substances 
travel in the phloem; water and salts travel mainly in 
the xylem. The cells in each tissue form elongated 
tubes called vessels (in the xylem) or sieve tubes (in 
the phloem) and they are surrounded and supported 
by other cells.
Vessels
The cells in the xylem that carry water become 
vessels. A vessel is made up of a series of long cells 
joined end to end (Figure 8.5(a)). Once a region 
of the plant has ceased growing, the end walls of

Functions of vascular bundles
In general, water travels up the stem in the xylem 
from the roots to the leaves. Food may travel either 
up or down the stem in the phloem, from the leaves 
where it is made (the ‘source’), to any part of the 
plant that is using or storing it (the ‘sink’).

Vascular bundles have a supporting function as 
well as a transport function, because they contain 
vessels, fi bres and other thick-walled, lignifi ed, 
elongated cells. In many stems, the vascular bundles 
are arranged in a cylinder, a little way in from the 
epidermis. This pattern of distribution helps the stem 

112

to resist the sideways bending forces caused by the 
wind. In a root, the vascular bundles are in the centre 
(Figure 8.6) where they resist the pulling forces that 
the root is likely to experience when the shoot is 
being blown about by the wind.

The network of veins in many leaves supports the 
soft mesophyll tissues and resists stresses that could 
lead to tearing.

The methods by which water, salts and food 

are moved through the vessels and sieve tubes are 
discussed in ‘Transpiration’ and ‘Translocation’ later 
in this chapter.

Figure 8.6  Transverse section through a root (×40). Notice that the 
vascular tissue is in the centre. Some root hairs can be seen in the outer 
layer of cells.

Cortex and pith
The tissue between the vascular bundles and 
the epidermis is called the cortex. Its cells often 
store starch. In green stems, the outer cortex 
cells contain chloroplasts and make food by 
photosynthesis. The central tissue of the stem is 
called pith. The cells of the pith and cortex act as 
packing tissues and help to support the stem in the 
same way that a lot of blown-up balloons packed 
tightly into a plastic bag would form quite a rigid 
structure.

Root
The internal structure of a typical root is shown in 
Figure 8.7. The vascular bundle is in the centre of the 
root (Figure 8.6), unlike the stem where the bundles 
form a cylinder in the cortex.

The xylem carries water and salts from the root to 
the stem. The phloem brings food from the stem to 
the root, to provide the root cells with substances for 
their energy and growth.
Outer layer and root hairs
There is no distinct epidermis in a root. At the root 
tip are several layers of cells forming the root cap. 
These cells are continually replaced as fast as they 
are worn away when the root tip is pushed through 
the soil.

Figure 8.7  Root structure

In a region above the root tip, where the root has 
just stopped growing, the cells of the outer layer 
produce tiny, tube-like outgrowths called root hairs 
(Figure 8.11, page 115). These can just be seen as a 
white furry layer on the roots of seedlings grown in 
moist air (Figure 8.8). In the soil, the root hairs grow

may arise. Where a main root is recognisable the 
arrangement is called a tap-root system (Figure 
8.10(a)).

Figure 8.8  Root hairs (×5) as they appear on a root grown in moist air

Root hairs remain alive for only a short time. 
The region of root just below a root hair zone is 
producing new root hairs while the root hairs at the 
top of the zone are shrivelling (Figure 8.9). Above 
the root hair zone, the cell walls of the outer layer 
become less permeable. This means that water cannot 
get in so easily.

●● Extension work
Tap root
When a seed germinates, a single root grows 
vertically down into the soil. Later, lateral roots 
grow from this at an acute angle outwards and 
downwards, and from these laterals other branches 

114

(a) tap-root system
e.g. dandelion

(b) fibrous root system

e.g. couch grass

Figure 8.10  Types of root system

Fibrous root 
When a seed of the grass and cereal group 
germinates, several roots grow out at the same 
time and laterals grow from them. There is no 
distinguishable main root and it is called a fi brous 
root system (Figure 8.10(b)).
Adventitious root
Where roots grow not from a main root, but 
directly from the stem as they do in bulbs, corms, 
rhizomes or ivy, they are called adventitious roots, 
but such a system may also be described as a fi brous 
rooting system.

●● Water uptake
Pathway taken by water
The water tension developed in the vessels by a 
rapidly transpiring plant (see next section) is thought 
to be suffi cient to draw water through the root from 
the soil. The water enters the root hair cells and is 
then passed on to cells in the root cortex. It enters 
the xylem vessels to be transported up the stem and 
into the leaves, arriving at the leaf mesophyll cells.

Practical work

Transport in the vascular bundles
n  Place the shoots of several leafy plants in a solution of 1% 

methylene blue. ‘Busy Lizzie’ (Impatiens) or celery stalks with 
leaves are usually effective. 

n  Leave the shoots in the light for up to 24 hours.

Result
If some of the stems are cut across, the dye will be seen in the 
vascular bundles (see Figure 2.2). In some cases the blue dye will 
also appear in the leaf veins.

Interpretation
These results show that the dye and, therefore, probably also the 
water, travel up the stem in the vascular bundles. Closer study 
would show that they travel in the xylem vessels.

Transport of water in the xylem
n  Cut three leafy shoots from a deciduous tree or shrub. Each 

shoot should have about the same number of leaves.

n  On one twig remove a ring of bark about 5 mm wide, about 

100 mm up from the cut base. 

n  With the second shoot, smear a layer of Vaseline over the cut 

base so that it blocks the vessels. The third twig is a control.

n  Place all three twigs in a jar with a little water. The water level 

must be below the region from which you removed the ring 
of bark. 

n  Leave the twigs where they can receive direct sunlight.

Result
After an hour or two, you will probably find that the twig with 
blocked vessels shows signs of wilting. The other two twigs 
should still have turgid leaves.

Interpretation
Removal of the bark (including the phloem) has not prevented 
water from reaching the leaves, but blocking the xylem vessels 
has. The vessels of the xylem, therefore, offer the most likely 
route for water passing up the stem.

As Figures 8.7 and 8.8 illustrate, the large number 
of tiny root hairs greatly increases the absorbing 
surface of a root system. The surface area of the root 
system of a mature rye plant has been estimated 
at about 200 m2. The additional surface provided 
by the root hairs was calculated to be 400 m2. The 
water in the surrounding soil is absorbed by osmosis 
(see Chapter 3). The precise pathway taken by the 
water is the subject of some debate, but the path of 
least resistance seems to be in or between the cell 
walls rather than through the cells.

Water uptake

When water loss through transpiration is slow, 

e.g. at night-time or just before bud burst in a 
deciduous tree, then osmosis may play a more 
important part in the uptake of water than water 
tension developed in the vessels. In Figure 8.11, 
showing a root hair in the soil, the cytoplasm of the 
root hair is partially permeable to water. The soil 
water is more dilute than the cell sap and so water 
passes by osmosis from the soil into the cell sap of 
the root hair cell. This flow of water into the root 
hair cell raises the cell’s turgor pressure. So water is 
forced out through the cell wall into the next cell 
and so on, right through the cortex of the root to 
the xylem vessels (Figure 8.12).

One problem for this explanation is that it has 
not been possible to demonstrate that there is 
an osmotic gradient across the root cortex that 
could produce this flow of water from cell to cell. 
Nevertheless, root pressure developed probably by 
osmosis does force water up the root system and 
into the stem.

Uptake of salts
The methods by which roots take up salts from the 
soil are not fully understood. Some salts may be 
carried in with the water drawn up by transpiration

It may be that diffusion from a relatively high 
concentration in the soil to a lower concentration 
in the root cells accounts for uptake of some 
individual salts, but it has been shown: (a) that 
salts can be taken from the soil even when their 
concentration is below that in the roots, and 
(b) that anything which interferes with respiration 
impairs the uptake of salts. This suggests that active 
transport (Chapter 3) plays an important part in the 
uptake of salts.

The growing regions of the root and the root hair 

zone (Figure 8.9) seem to be most active in taking 
up salts. Most of the salts appear to be carried at 
first in the xylem vessels, though they soon appear 
in the phloem as well.

The salts are used by the plant’s cells to build 
up essential molecules. Nitrates, for example, are 
combined with carbohydrates to make amino acids 
in the roots. These amino acids are used later to 
make proteins.

●● Transpiration
The main force that draws water from the soil and 
through the plant is caused by a process called 
transpiration. Water evaporates from the leaves and 
causes a kind of ‘suction’, which pulls water up the stem 
(Figure 8.13). The water travels up the xylem vessels in 
the vascular bundles (see Figure 8.3, page 111) and this 
flow of water is called the transpiration stream.

Key definition
Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from plant leaves by 
evaporation of water at the surfaces of the mesophyll cells 
followed by the diffusion of water vapour through the 
stomata.

Practical work

To demonstrate water loss by a plant
The apparatus shown in Figure 8.14 is called a weight potometer. 
A well-watered potted plant is prepared by surrounding the pot 
with a plastic bag, sealed around the stem of the plant with 
an elastic band or string. The plant is then placed on a top-pan 
balance and its mass is recorded. After a measured time period 
e.g. 24 hours, the plant is re-weighed and the difference in mass 
calculated. Knowing the time which has elapsed, the rate of mass 
loss per hour can be calculated. The process can be repeated, 
exposing the plant to different environmental conditions, such as 
higher temperature, wind speed, humidity or light intensity.

Results
The plant loses mass over the measured time period. Increases in 
temperature, wind speed and light intensity result in larger rates 
of loss of mass. An increase in humidity would be expected to 
reduce the rate of loss of mass.

Interpretation
As the roots and soil surrounding the plant have been sealed 
in a plastic bag, it can be assumed that any mass lost must be 
due to the evaporation of water vapour from the stem or leaves 
(transpiration). Increases in temperature, wind speed and light 
intensity all cause the rate of transpiration to get higher, so 
the rate of loss of mass from the plant increases. An increase 
in humidity reduces transpiration, so the rate of loss of mass 
slows down.

Rates of water uptake in different 
conditions
The apparatus shown in Figure 8.15 is called a potometer. It is 
designed to measure the rate of uptake of water in a cut shoot.

n  Fill the syringe with water and attach it to the side arm of the 

3-way tap. 

n  Turn the tap downwards (i) and press the syringe until water 

comes out of the rubber tubing at the top.

n  Collect a leafy shoot and push its stem into the rubber tubing 

as far as possible. Set up the apparatus in a part of the 
laboratory that is not receiving direct sunlight.

n  Turn the tap up (ii) and press the syringe until water comes out 
of the bottom of the capillary tube. Turn the tap horizontally (iii).

n  As the shoot transpires, it will draw water from the capillary 

tube and the level can be seen to rise. Record the distance 
moved by the water column in 30 seconds or a minute.
n  Turn the tap up and send the water column back to the 

bottom of the capillary. Turn the tap horizontally and make 
another measurement of the rate of uptake. In this way obtain 
the average of three readings.

Figure 8.15  A potometer
n  The conditions can now be changed in one of the following ways:
1  Move the apparatus into sunlight or under a fluorescent lamp.
2  Blow air past the shoot with an electric fan or merely fan it 

with an exercise book.

3  Cover the shoot with a plastic bag.

n  After each change of conditions, take three more readings 
of the rate of uptake and notice whether they represent an 
increase or a decrease in the rate of transpiration.

Results

1  An increase in light intensity should make the stomata open 

and allow more rapid transpiration.

2  Moving air should increase the rate of evaporation and, 

therefore, the rate of uptake.

3  The plastic bag will cause a rise in humidity round the leaves 

and suppress transpiration.

 8  TransporT in planTs

Interpretation
Ideally, you should change only one condition at a time. If you 
took the experiment outside, you would be changing the light 
intensity, the temperature and the air movement. When the rate 
of uptake increased, you would not know which of these three 
changes was mainly responsible.

To obtain reliable results, you should really keep taking 

readings until three of them are nearly the same. A change in 
conditions may take 10 or 15 minutes before it produces a new, 
steady rate of uptake. In practice, you may not have time to do 
this, but even your first three readings should indicate a trend 
towards increased or decreased uptake.

Note: a simpler version of potometer can be used effectively. 

This does not include the syringe or scaled capillary tubing shown 
in Figure 8.15. 

n  The plant stem can be attached directly to a length of capillary 

tubing with a short section of rubber tubing. This is best 
carried out in a bowl of water. 

n  While still in the water, squeeze the rubber tubing to force out 

any air bubbles. 

n  Remove the potometer from the water and rub a piece of filter 

paper against the end of the capillary tubing to introduce an 
air bubble. The capillary tubing does not need to have a scale: 
a ruler can be clamped next to the tubing. 

n  Record the distance moved by the bubble over a measured 

period of time. Then place the end of the capillary tubing in a 
beaker of water and squeeze out the air bubble. 

n  Introduce a new air bubble as previously described and take 

further readings.

 Limitations of the potometer
Although we use the potometer to compare rates of 
transpiration, it is really the rates of uptake that we are 
observing. Not all the water taken up will be transpired; some 
will be used in photosynthesis; some may be absorbed by cells 
to increase their turgor. However, these quantities are very small 
compared with the volume of water transpired and they can be 
disregarded.

The rate of uptake of a cut shoot may not reflect the rate in 
the intact plant. If the root system were present, it might offer 
resistance to the flow of water or it could be helping the flow by 
means of its root pressure.

To find which surface of a leaf loses 
more water vapour
n  Cut four leaves of about the same size from a plant (do not 
use an evergreen plant). Protect the bench with newspaper 
and then treat each leaf as follows:
a  Smear a thin layer of Vaseline (petroleum jelly) on the lower 

surface.

b  Smear Vaseline on the upper surface.
c  Smear Vaseline on both surfaces.
d  Leave both surfaces free of Vaseline.

n  Place a little Vaseline on the cut end of the leaf stalk and 

then suspend the four leaves from a retort stand with cotton 
threads for several days.

118

Result
All the leaves will have shrivelled and curled up to some extent 
but the ones that lost most water will be the most shrivelled 
(Figure 8.16).

(d)  neither
      surface

Interpretation
The Vaseline prevents evaporation. The untreated leaf and the 
leaf with its upper surface sealed show the greatest degree of 
shrivelling, so it is from the lower surface that leaves lose most 
water by evaporation.

More accurate results may be obtained by weighing the leaves 

at the start and the end of the experiment. It is best to group 
the leaves from the whole class into their respective batches and 
weigh each batch. Ideally, the weight loss should be expressed as 
a percentage of the initial weight.

More rapid results can be obtained by sticking small squares of 
blue cobalt chloride paper to the upper and lower surface of the 
same leaf using transparent adhesive tape (Figure 8.17). Cobalt 
chloride paper changes from blue to pink as it takes up moisture. 
By comparing the time taken for each square to go pink, the 
relative rates of evaporation from each surface can be compared.

The results of either experiment can be correlated with the 
numbers of stomata on the upper and lower epidermis. This can 
be done by painting clear nail varnish or ‘Germoline New-skin’ 
over each surface and allowing it to dry. The varnish is then 
peeled off and examined under the microscope. The outlines of 
the guard cells can be seen and counted.

The cells in part of a leaf blade are shown in 
Figure 8.18. As explained in ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3, 
the cell sap in each cell is exerting a turgor pressure 
outwards on the cell wall. This pressure forces some 
water out of the cell wall, evaporating into the air 
space between the cells. The water vapour passes by 
diffusion through the air spaces in the mesophyll 
and out of the stomata. It is this loss of water 
vapour from the leaves that is called ‘transpiration’. 
Each leaf contains many air spaces in the spongy 
mesophyll and the air becomes saturated with water 
vapour. There are hundreds of stomata, particularly 
on the lower epidermis of the leaf, enabling water 
vapour to diffuse from a high concentration in the 
air spaces into the atmosphere (representing a lower 
concentration of water vapour, unless the humidity 
is high).

In addition to the water passing along the cell 
walls, a small amount will pass right through the 
cells. When leaf cell A in Figure 8.19 loses water, 
its turgor pressure will fall. This fall in pressure 
allows the water in the cell wall to enter the vacuole 
and so restore the turgor pressure. In conditions 
of water shortage, cell A may be able to get water 
by osmosis from cell B more easily than B can 
get it from the xylem vessels. In this case, all the 
mesophyll cells will be losing water faster than they 
can absorb it from the vessels, and the leaf will wilt 
(see ‘Osmosis’ in Chapter 3). Water loss from the 
cell vacuoles results in the cells losing their turgor 
and becoming flaccid. A leaf with flaccid cells 
will be limp and the stem will droop. A plant that 
loses water to this extent is said to be ‘wilting’ (see 
Figure 3.11). 

The cell walls that are losing water in this 

way replace it by drawing water from the 
nearest vein. Most of this water travels along 
the cell walls without actually going inside the 
cells (Figure 8.19). Thousands of leaf cells are 
evaporating water like this: their surfaces represent 
a very large surface area. More water is drawn up 
to replace the evaporated water, from the xylem 
vessels in the veins. As a result, water is pulled 
through the xylem vessels and up the stem from 
the roots. This transpiration pull is strong enough 
to draw up water 50 metres or more in trees 
(Figure 8.20).

 Importance of transpiration
A tree, on a hot day, may draw up hundreds of litres 
of water from the soil (Figure 8.20). Most of this 
water evaporates from the leaves; only a tiny fraction 
is retained for photosynthesis and to maintain the 
turgor of the cells. The advantage to the plant of 
this excessive evaporation is not clear. A rapid water 
flow may be needed to obtain sufficient mineral 
salts, which are in very dilute solution in the soil. 
Evaporation may also help to cool the leaf when it is 
exposed to intense sunlight.

Against the first possibility, it has to be pointed 
out that, in some cases, an increased transpiration 
rate does not increase the uptake of minerals.

The second possibility, the cooling effect, might 
be very important. A leaf exposed to direct sunlight 
will absorb heat and its temperature may rise to a 
level that could kill the cytoplasm. Water evaporating 
from a leaf absorbs its latent heat and cools the leaf 
down. This is probably one value of transpiration. 
However, there are plants whose stomata close at 
around midday, greatly reducing transpiration. How 
do these plants avoid overheating?

Many biologists regard transpiration as an 

inevitable consequence of photosynthesis. In order to 
photosynthesise, a leaf has to take in carbon dioxide 
from the air. The pathway that allows carbon dioxide in 
will also let water vapour out whether the plant needs 
to lose water or not. In all probability, plants have to 
maintain a careful balance between the optimum intake 
of carbon dioxide and a damaging loss of water. Plants 
achieve this balance in different ways, some of which 
are described in ‘Adaptive features’ in Chapter 18.
 The role of stomata
The opening and closing of stomata can be triggered 
by a variety of factors, principally light intensity, 
carbon dioxide concentration and humidity. These 
factors interact with each other. For example, 
a rise in light intensity will increase the rate of 
photosynthesis and so lower the carbon dioxide 
concentration in the leaf. These are the conditions 
you would expect to influence stomatal aperture if 
the stomata are to control the balance between loss 
of water vapour and uptake of carbon dioxide.

The stomata also react to water stress, i.e. if the leaf 

is losing water by transpiration faster than it is being 
taken up by the roots. Before wilting sets in, the 
stomata start to close. Although they do not prevent 
wilting, the stomata do seem to delay its onset.

Figure 8.20  Californian redwoods. Some of these trees are over 
100 metres tall. Transpiration from their leaves pulls hundreds of litres of 
water up the trunk.

Rate of transpiration
Transpiration is the evaporation of water from 
the leaves, so any change that increases or 
reduces evaporation will have the same effect on 
transpiration.
 Light intensity
Light itself does not affect evaporation, but in 
daylight the stomata of the leaves are open (see 
‘Leaf structure’ in Chapter 6). This allows the 
water vapour in the leaves to diffuse out into the 
atmosphere. At night, when the stomata close, 
transpiration is greatly reduced.

Generally speaking, then, transpiration speeds up 
when light intensity increases because the stomata 
respond to changes in light intensity.

120

8/18/14   9:46 PM

Sunlight may also warm up the leaves and increase 

evaporation (see below).
 Humidity
If the air is very humid, i.e. contains a great deal of 
water vapour, it can accept very little more from the 
plants and so transpiration slows down. In dry air, 
the diffusion of water vapour from the leaf to the 
atmosphere will be rapid.
 Air movements
In still air, the region round a transpiring leaf will 
become saturated with water vapour so that no 
more can escape from the leaf. In these conditions, 
transpiration would slow down. In moving air, the 
water vapour will be swept away from the leaf as fast 
as it diffuses out. This will speed up transpiration.
 Temperature
Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold air. 
Thus evaporation or transpiration will take place 
more rapidly into warm air.

Furthermore, when the Sun shines on the leaves, 

they will absorb heat as well as light. This warms 
them up and increases the rate of evaporation of 
water.

Investigations into the effect of some of these 

conditions on the rate of transpiration are described 
earlier in this chapter.
Water movement in the xylem
You may have learned that you cannot draw water 
up by ‘suction’ to a height of more than about 
10 metres. Many trees are taller than this yet they 
can draw up water effectively. The explanation 
offered is that, in long vertical columns of water in 
very thin tubes, the attractive forces between the 
water molecules result in cohesion (the molecules 
stick together). The attractive forces are greater than 
the forces trying to separate them. So, in effect, the 
transpiration stream is pulling up thin threads of 
water, which resist the tendency to break.

There are still problems, however. It is likely that 
the water columns in some of the vessels do have air 
breaks in them and yet the total water flow is not 
affected.
 Evidence for the pathway of water
The experiment on page 115 uses a dye to show that 
in a cut stem, the dye and, therefore, presumably 

Translocation

the water, travels in the vascular bundles. Closer 
examination with a microscope would show that it 
travels in the xylem vessels.

Removal of a ring of bark (which includes the 

phloem) does not affect the passage of water 
along a branch. Killing parts of a branch by heat 
or poisons does not interrupt the flow of water, 
but anything that blocks the vessels does stop 
the flow.

The evidence all points to the non-living xylem 

vessels as the main route by which water passes from 
the soil to the leaves.

●● Translocation

Key definition
Translocation is the movement of sucrose and amino acids 
in the phloem, from regions of production (the ‘source’) 
to regions of storage or to regions where they are used in 
respiration or growth (the ‘sink’).

The xylem sap is always a very dilute solution, but 
the phloem sap may contain up to 25% of dissolved 
solids, the bulk of which consists of sucrose and 
amino acids. There is a good deal of evidence to 
support the view that sucrose, amino acids and many 
other substances are transported in the phloem. This 
is called translocation.

The movement of water and salts in the xylem 

is always upwards, from soil to leaf, but in the 
phloem the solutes may be travelling up or down 
the stem. The carbohydrates made in the leaf during 
photosynthesis are converted to sucrose and carried 
out of the leaf (the source) to the stem. From here, 
the sucrose may pass upwards to growing buds 
and fruits or downwards to the roots and storage 
organs (sink). All parts of a plant that cannot 
photosynthesise will need a supply of nutrients 
brought by the phloem. It is quite possible for 
substances to be travelling upwards and downwards 
at the same time in the phloem.

Some insects feed using syringe-like mouthparts, 

piercing the stems of plants to extract liquid from the 
phloem vessels. Figure 8.21 shows aphids feeding 
on a rose plant. The pressure of sucrose solution in 
the phloem can be so great that it is forced through 
the gut of the aphid and droplets of the sticky liquid 
exude from its anus.

Some parts of a plant can act as a source and a 
sink at different times during the life of a plant. 
For example, while a bud containing new leaves is 
forming it would require nutrients and therefore 
act as a sink. However, once the bud has burst 
and the leaves are photosynthesising, the region 
would act as a source, sending newly synthesised 

Questions
Core
  1  Make a list of the types of cells or tissues you would expect 

to fi nd in a vascular bundle.

  2  What structures help to keep the stem’s shape and upright 

position?

  3  What are the differences between xylem and phloem:

a  in structure
b  in function?

  4  State briefl y the functions of the following: xylem, root 

hair, root cap, epidermis.

  5  If you were given a cylindrical structure cut from part of a 

plant, how could you tell whether it was a piece of stem or 
a piece of root:
a  with the naked eye
b  with the aid of a microscope or hand lens?

  6  Describe the path taken by a water molecule from the soil 

until it reaches a mesophyll cell of a leaf to be made into 
sugar.

  7  Why do you think that root hairs are produced only on the 

parts of the root system that have stopped growing?
  8  Discuss whether you would expect to fi nd a vascular 

bundle in a fl ower petal.

sugars and amino acids to other parts of the plant. 
Similarly, the new tuber of a potato plant would 
act as a sink while it was growing, storing sugars as 
starch. (Starch is a good storage molecule because 
it is insoluble and quite compact.) However, once 
the buds on the tubers start to grow, the stored 
starch is converted to sucrose, a soluble nutrient, 
which will be passed to these buds from the tuber. 
So the tuber becomes the source. The shoots 
will eventually become sources, once they break 
through the soil and produce new leaves that 
can photosynthesise. Bulbs, such as those of the 
daffodil and snowdrop (see ‘Asexual reproduction’ 
in Chapter 16), act in the same way, although they 
tend to store sugars as well as starch.

There is no doubt that substances travel in the 
sieve tubes of the phloem, but the mechanism by 
which they are moved is not fully understood. We do 
know that translocation depends on living processes 
because anything that inhibits cell metabolism, 
e.g. poisons or high temperatures, also arrests 
translocation.

10  A plant’s roots may take up water and salts less effi ciently 
from a waterlogged soil than from a fairly dry soil. Revise 
‘Active transport’ (Chapter 3) and suggest reasons for this.

11  Why do you think that, in a deciduous tree in spring, 

transpiration is negligible before bud burst?

12  Describe the pathway followed by a water molecule from 
the time it enters a plant root to the time it escapes into 
the atmosphere from a leaf.

13  What kind of climate and weather conditions do you think 

will cause a high rate of transpiration?

14  What would happen to the leaves of a plant that was 

losing water by transpiration faster than it was taking it up 
from the roots?

15  In what two ways does sunlight increase the rate of 

transpiration?

16  Apart from drawing water through the plant, what else 

may be drawn up by the transpiration stream?

17  Transpiration has been described in this chapter as if it 

takes place only in leaves. In what other parts of a plant 
might transpiration occur?

18  How do sieve tubes and vessels differ:

a  in the substances they transport
b  in the directions these substances are carried?

19  A complete ring of bark cut from around the 

circumference of a tree-trunk causes the tree to die. The 
xylem continues to carry water and salts to the leaves, 
which can make all the substances needed by the tree. So 
why does the tree die?

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 8 you should know and understand the 
following:
•  The shoot of a plant consists of the stem, leaves, buds and 

flowers.

•  The roots hold the plant in the soil, absorb the water and 
mineral salts needed by the plant for making sugars and 
proteins and, in some cases, store food for the plant.

•  The root hairs make very close contact with soil particles and 

are the main route by which water and mineral salts enter 
the plant.

•  The stem supports the leaves and flowers.
•  The stem contains vascular bundles (veins).
•  The leaves carry out photosynthesis and allow gaseous 
exchange of carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapour.

•  Closure of the stomata stops the entry of carbon dioxide into 

a leaf but also reduces water loss.

•  The xylem vessels in the veins carry water up the stem to the 

leaves.

•  The phloem in the veins carries food up or down the stem to 

wherever it is needed.

•  The position of vascular bundles helps the stem to withstand 

sideways bending and the root to resist pulling forces.

•  Transpiration is the evaporation of water vapour from the 

leaves of a plant.

Translocation

•  The water travelling in the transpiration stream will contain 

dissolved salts.

•  Closure of stomata and shedding of leaves may help to 

regulate the transpiration rate.

•  The rate of transpiration is increased by sunlight, high 

temperature and low humidity.

•  Salts are taken up from the soil by roots, and are carried in 

the xylem vessels.

•  Transpiration produces the force that draws water up the 

stem.

•  Root pressure forces water up the stem as a result of 

osmosis in the roots.

•  The large surface area provided by root hairs increases the 

rate of absorption of water (osmosis) and mineral ions 
(active transport).

•  The large surface area provided by cell surfaces, 

interconnecting air spaces and stomata in the leaf 
encourages water loss.

•  Wilting occurs when the volume of water vapour lost by 

leaves is greater than that absorbed by roots.

•  Translocation is the movement of sucrose and amino acids 

in phloem.

•  The point where food is made is called a source.
•  The place where food is taken to and used is called a sink.

●● Transport in animals
The blood, pumped by the heart, travels all around 
the body in blood vessels. It leaves the heart in 
arteries and returns in veins. Valves, present in 
the heart and veins, ensure a one-way fl ow for the 
blood. As blood enters an organ, the arteries divide 
into smaller arterioles, which supply capillaries. In 
these vessels the blood moves much more slowly, 
allowing the exchange of materials such as oxygen 
and glucose, carbon dioxide and other wastes. 
Blood leaving an organ is collected in venules, which 
transfer it on to larger veins.

Single circulation of ﬁ sh
Fish have the simplest circulatory system of all 
the vertebrates. A heart, consisting of one blood-
collecting chamber (the atrium) and one blood-
ejection chamber (the ventricle), sends blood to the 
gills where it is oxygenated. The blood then fl ows to 
all the parts of the body before returning to the heart 
(Figure 9.1).This is known as a single circulation 
because the blood goes through the heart once for 
each complete circulation of the body. However, as 
the blood passes through capillaries in the gills, blood 
pressure is lost, but the blood still needs to circulate 
through other organs of the body before returning 
to the heart to increase blood pressure. This makes 
the fi sh circulatory system ineffi cient.

The blood passes twice through the heart during 
one complete circuit: once on its way to the body 
and again on its way to the lungs. The circulation 
through the lungs is called the pulmonary 
circulation; the circulation around the rest of 
the body is called the systemic circulation. 
On average, a red blood cell would go around 
the whole circulation in 45 seconds. A more 
detailed diagram of the circulation is shown in 
Figure 9.20.

A double circulation has the advantage of 
maintaining a high blood pressure to all the 
major organs of the body. The right side of the 
heart collects blood from the body, builds up 
the blood pressure and sends it to the lungs to 
be oxygenated, but the pressure drops during 
the process. The left side of the heart receives 
oxygenated blood from the lungs, builds up the 
blood pressure again and pumps the oxygenated 
blood to the body.

system to all the major organs of the body. The

If you study Figure 9.5 you will see that there are 
four chambers. The upper, thin-walled chambers are 
the atria (singular = atrium) and each of these opens 
into a thick-walled chamber, the ventricle, below. 

Blood enters the atria from large veins. The 

pulmonary vein brings oxygenated blood from 
the lungs into the left atrium. The vena cava brings 
deoxygenated blood from the body tissues into the 
right atrium. The blood passes from each atrium to 
its corresponding ventricle, and the ventricle pumps it 
out into the arteries. The left chambers are separated 
from the right chambers by a wall of muscle called a 
septum.

The artery carrying oxygenated blood to the body 
from the left ventricle is the aorta. The pulmonary 
artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right 
ventricle to the lungs.

In pumping the blood, the muscle in the walls of the 

atria and ventricles contracts and relaxes (Figure 9.6). 
The walls of the atria contract first and force blood 
into the two ventricles. Then the ventricles contract 
and send blood into the arteries. Valves prevent blood 
flowing backwards during or after heart contractions.

The heart muscle is supplied with food and oxygen 

by the coronary arteries (Figure 9.3).

There are a number of ways by which the activity of 
the heart can be monitored. These include measuring 
pulse rate, listening to heart sounds and the use of 
electrocardiograms (ECGs).
Pulse rate
The ripple of pressure that passes down an artery 
as a result of the heart beat can be felt as a ‘pulse’ 
when the artery is near the surface of the body. You 
can feel the pulse in your radial artery by pressing 
the fingertips of one hand on the wrist of the other 

126

Figure 9.7  Taking the pulse

Heart sounds
These can be heard using a stethoscope. This 
instrument amplifies the sounds of the heart valves 
opening and closing. A healthy heart produces a 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_9.indd   126

8/18/14   9:47 PM

regular ‘lub-dub’ sound. The fi rst (‘lub’) sound is 
caused by the closure of the valves separating the 
atria from the ventricles. The second (‘dub’) sound 
represents the closure of the valves at the entrance 
of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Observation of 
irregular sounds may indicate an irregular heartbeat. 
If the ‘lub’ or ‘dub’ sounds are not clear then this 
may point to a problem with faulty valves.
ECGs
An ECG is an electrocardiogram. To obtain an ECG, 
electrodes, attached to an ECG recording machine, are 
stuck onto the surface of the skin on the arms, legs and 
chest (Figure 9.8). Electrical activity associated with 
heartbeat is then monitored and viewed on a computer 
screen or printed out (Figure 9.9). Any irregularity in 
the trace can be used to diagnose heart problems.

Heart

70 times a minute, but this varies according to a 
person’s age, gender and fi tness: higher if you are 
younger, higher if you are female and lower if you are 
fi t. An increase in physical activity increases the pulse 
rate, which can rise to 200 beats per minute. After 
exercise has stopped, the pulse rate gradually drops to 
its resting state. How quickly this happens depends 
on the fi tness of the individual (an unfi t person’s 
pulse rate will take longer to return to normal).
Coronary heart disease
In the lining of the large and medium arteries, deposits 
of a fatty substance, called atheroma, are laid down in 
patches. This happens to everyone and the patches get 
more numerous and extensive with age, but until one of 
them actually blocks an important artery the effects are 
not noticed. It is not known how or why the deposits 
form. Some doctors think that fatty substances in the 
blood pass into the lining. Others believe that small 
blood clots form on damaged areas of the lining and are 
covered over by the atheroma patches. The patches may 
join up to form a continuous layer, which reduces the 
internal diameter of the vessel (Figure 9.10).

The effect of physical activity on the 
pulse rate
A heartbeat is a contraction. Each contraction 
squeezes blood to the lungs and body. The pulse is a 
pressure wave passing through the arteries as a result 
of the heartbeat. At rest, the heart beats about 

(c) thrombus forming

Figure 9.10  Atheroma and thrombus formation

The surface of a patch of atheroma sometimes 
becomes rough and causes fi brinogen in the plasma to 
deposit fi brin on it, causing a blood clot (a thrombus)

to form. If the blood clot blocks the coronary 
artery (Figure 9.3), which supplies the muscles of 
the ventricles with blood, it starves the muscles of 
oxygenated blood and the heart may stop beating. This 
is a severe heart attack from coronary thrombosis. A 
thrombus might form anywhere in the arterial system, 
but its effects in the coronary artery and in parts of the 
brain (strokes) are the most drastic.

In the early stages of coronary heart disease, the 

atheroma may partially block the coronary artery and 
reduce the blood supply to the heart (Figure 9.11). 
This can lead to angina, i.e. a pain in the chest that 
occurs during exercise or exertion. This is a warning 
to the person that he or she is at risk and should take 
precautions to avoid a heart attack.

Blood cholesterol can be influenced, to some 
extent, by the amount and type of fat in the diet. 
Many doctors and dieticians believe that animal fats 
(milk, cream, butter, cheese, egg-yolk, fatty meat) are 
more likely to raise the blood cholesterol than are the 
vegetable oils, which contain a high proportion of 
unsaturated fatty acids (see ‘Diet’ in Chapter 7). 

An unbalanced diet with too many calories can lead 

to obesity. Being overweight puts extra strain on the 
heart and makes it more difficult for the person to 
exercise.
Stress
Emotional stress often leads to raised blood pressure. 
High blood pressure may increase the rate at which 
atheroma are formed in the arteries.
Smoking
Statistical studies suggest that smokers are two to 
three times more likely to die from a heart attack 
than are non-smokers of a similar age (Figure 9.12). 
The carbon monoxide and other chemicals in 
cigarette smoke may damage the lining of the 
arteries, allowing atheroma to form, but there is very 
little direct evidence for this.

Figure 9.11  Atheroma partially blocking the coronary artery

Possible causes of coronary heart disease
Atheroma and thrombus formation are the 
immediate causes of a heart attack but the long-term 
causes that give rise to these conditions are not well 
understood.

There is an inherited tendency towards the disease 

but incidences of the disease have increased very 
significantly in affluent countries in recent years. This 
makes us think that some features of ‘Western’ diets 
or lifestyles might be causing it. The main risk factors 
are thought to be an unbalanced diet with too much 
fat, stress, smoking, genetic disposition, age, gender 
and lack of exercise.
Diet
The atheroma deposits contain cholesterol, which 
is present, combined with lipids and proteins, in 
the blood. Cholesterol plays an essential part in our 
physiology, but it is known that people with high levels 
of blood cholesterol are more likely to suffer from 
heart attacks than people with low cholesterol levels.

Heart

Genetic predisposition
Coronary heart disease appears to be passed from one 
generation to the next in some families. This is not 
something we have any control over, but we can be 
aware of this risk and reduce some of the other risk 
factors to compensate.
Age and gender
As we get older our risk of suffering from coronary 
heart disease increases. Males are more at risk of a 

heart attack than females: it may be that males tend 
to have less healthy lifestyles than females.
Lack of exercise
Heart muscle loses its tone and becomes less 
effi cient at pumping blood when exercise is not 
untaken. A sluggish blood fl ow, resulting from lack 
of exercise, may allow atheroma to form in the 
arterial lining but, once again, the direct evidence 
for this is slim.

Control of blood ﬂ ow through 
the heart
The blood is stopped from fl owing backwards 
by four sets of valves. Valves that separate each 
atrium from the ventricle below it are known 
as atrioventricular valves. Between the right 
atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid (= 
three fl aps) valve. Between the left atrium and 
left ventricle is the bicuspid (= two fl aps) valve. 
The fl aps of these valves are shaped rather like 
parachutes, with ‘strings’ called tendons or cords to 
prevent them from being turned inside out.

In the pulmonary artery and aorta are the semi-
lunar (= half-moon) valves. These each consist of 
three ‘pockets’, which are pushed fl at against the 
artery walls when blood fl ows one way. If blood 
tries to fl ow the other way, the pockets fi ll up 
and meet in the middle to stop the fl ow of blood 
(Figure 9.13).

From the description above, it may seem that 

the ventricles are fi lled with blood as a result of the 
contraction of the atria. However, the atria have 
much thinner muscle walls than the ventricles. 
In fact, when the ventricles relax, their internal 
volume increases and they draw in blood from the 
pulmonary vein or vena cava through the relaxed 
atria. Atrial contraction then forces the fi nal amount 
of blood into the ventricles just before ventricular 
contraction.

The left ventricle (sometimes referred to as the 

‘large left ventricle’) has a wall made of cardiac 
muscle that is about three times thicker than the 
wall of the right ventricle. This is because the right 
ventricle only needs to create enough pressure to 
pump blood to one organ, the lungs, which are 
next to the heart. However, the left ventricle has to 
pump blood to all the major organs of the body, as 
shown in Figure 9.20. It should be noted that the 
left and right ventricles pump the same volume of 
blood: the left ventricle does not have a thicker wall 
to pump more blood!

Figure 9.13  Action of the semi-lunar valves

When the ventricles contract, blood pressure closes 
the bicuspid and tricuspid valves and these prevent 
blood returning to the atria. When the ventricles 
relax, the blood pressure in the arteries closes the 
semi-lunar valves, preventing the return of blood to 
the ventricles.

●● Extension work
Blood circulation in the fetus
The septum separating the left and right heart 
chambers prevents the oxygenated blood in the left 
chambers from mixing with the deoxygenated blood 
in the right chambers. When a fetus is developing, 
there is a hole (the foramen ovale) between the 
right atrium and the left atrium, allowing blood to 
bypass the lungs. This is because the fetal blood is 
oxygenated by the placenta rather than the lungs. 
During the birth sequence, the foramen ovale closes, 
so all blood in the right atrium passes into the 
right ventricle and on to the lungs for oxygenation. 
Occasionally, the foramen ovale does not seal 
completely and the baby suffers from a ‘hole in the 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_9.indd   129

 9  TransporT in animals

heart’. Babies suffering from this condition tend to 
look blue because their blood is not being adequately 
oxygenated: some of it bypasses the lungs.
Control of the heartbeat
Heart muscle has a natural rhythmic contraction 
of its own, about 40 contractions per minute. 
However, it is supplied by nerves, which maintain a 
faster rate that can be adjusted to meet the body’s 
needs for oxygen. At rest, the normal heart rate may 
lie between 50 and 100 beats per minute, according 
to age, gender and other factors. During exercise, 
the rate may increase to 200 beats per minute.

The heart beat is initiated by the ‘pacemaker’, a 
small group of specialised muscle cells at the top of 
the right atrium. The pacemaker receives two sets of 
nerves from the brain. One group of nerves speeds 
up the heart rate and the other group slows it down. 
These nerves originate from a centre in the brain 
that receives an input from receptors (See ‘Nervous 
control in humans’ in Chapter 14) in the circulatory 
system that are sensitive to blood pressure and levels 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. 

If blood pressure rises, nervous impulses reduce 

the heart rate. A fall in blood pressure causes a 
rise in the rate. Reduced oxygen concentration 
or increased carbon dioxide in the blood also 
contributes to a faster rate. By this means, the heart 
rate is adjusted to meet the needs of the body at 
times of rest, exertion and excitement.

The hormone adrenaline (see ‘Hormones in 

humans’ in Chapter 14) also affects the heart rate. 
In conditions of excitement, activity or stress, 
adrenaline is released into the blood circulation from 
the adrenal glands. On reaching the heart it causes 
an increase in the rate and strength of the heartbeat.

Physical activity and heart rate
During periods of physical activity, active parts of 
the body (mainly skeletal muscle) respire faster, 
demanding more oxygen and glucose. Increased 
respiration also produces more carbon dioxide, 
which needs to be removed. Blood carries the 
oxygen and glucose, so the heart rate needs to 
increase to satisfy demand. If the muscle does 
not get enough oxygen, it will start to respire 
anaerobically, producing lactic acid (lactate). Lactic 
acid build-up causes muscle fatigue, leading to 

130

cramp. An ‘oxygen debt’ is created, which needs to 
be repaid after exercise by continued rapid breathing 
and higher than normal heart rate (see ‘Anaerobic 
respiration’ in Chapter 12). 

Correlation and cause
It is not possible or desirable to conduct experiments 
on humans to find out, more precisely, the causes of 
heart attacks. The evidence has to be collected from 
long-term studies on populations of individuals, 
e.g. smokers and non-smokers. Statistical analysis 
of these studies will often show a correlation, e.g. 
more smokers, within a given age band, suffer heart 
attacks than do non-smokers of the same age. This 
correlation does not prove that smoking causes 
heart attacks. It could be argued that people who 
are already prone to heart attacks for other reasons 
(e.g. high blood pressure) are more likely to take up 
smoking. This may strike you as implausible, but until 
it can be shown that substances in tobacco smoke do 
cause an increase in atheroma, the correlation cannot 
be used on its own to claim a cause and effect.

Nevertheless, there are so many other correlations 

between smoking and ill-health (e.g. bronchitis, 
emphysema, lung cancer) that the circumstantial 
evidence against smoking is very strong.

Another example of a positive correlation is 
between the possession of a television set and 
heart disease. Nobody would seriously claim that 
television sets cause heart attacks. The correlation 
probably reflects an affluent way of life, associated 
with over-eating, fatty diets, lack of exercise and 
other factors that may contribute to coronary heart 
disease.

Prevention of coronary heart 
disease
Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet will result in 
less chance of a person becoming obese. There will 
also be a low intake of saturated fats, so the chances 
of atheroma and thrombus formation are reduced.

There is some evidence that regular, vigorous 

exercise reduces the chances of a heart attack. This 
may be because it increases muscle tone – not only 
of skeletal muscle, but also of cardiac muscle. Good 
heart muscle tone leads to an improved coronary 
blood flow and the heart requires less effort to 
keep pumping.

Treatment of coronary heart 
disease
The simplest treatment for a patient who suffers 
from coronary heart disease is to be given a regular 
dose of aspirin (salicylic acid). Aspirin prevents the 
formation of blood clots in the arteries, which can 
lead to a heart attack. It has been found that long-
term use of low-dose aspirin also reduces the risk of 
coronary heart disease.

Methods of removing or treating atheroma and 

thrombus formations include the use of angioplasty, 
a stent and, in the most severe cases, by-pass surgery.

 Angioplasty and stent
Angioplasty involves the insertion of a long, thin 
tube called a catheter into the blocked or narrowed 
blood vessel. A wire attached to a defl ated balloon is 
then fed through the catheter to the damaged artery. 
Once in place, the balloon is infl ated to widen the 
artery wall, effectively freeing the blockage. In some 
cases a stent is also applied. This is a wire-mesh tube 
that can be expanded and left in place (Figure 9.14). 
It then acts as scaffolding, keeping the blood vessel 
open and maintaining the free fl ow of blood. Some 
stents are designed to give a slow release of chemicals 
to prevent further blockage of the artery.

 By-pass surgery 
The surgeon removes a section of blood vessel from 
a different part of the body, such as the leg. The 
blood vessel is then attached around the blocked 
region of artery to by-pass it, allowing blood to pass 
freely. This is a major, invasive operation because it 
involves open-heart surgery.

Heart

Practical work

Heart dissection
■  Obtain an intact heart (sheep or goat for example) from a 

butcher’s shop or abattoir. 

■  Rinse it under a tap to remove excess blood. 
■  Observe the surface of the heart, identifying the main visible 

features (shown in Figure 9.3). The blood vessels may have 
been cut off, but it is possible to identify where these would 
have been attached later in the dissection. 

■  Gently squeeze the ventricles. They can be distinguished 

because the wall of the right ventricle is much thinner than 
that of the left ventricle. 

■  Using a pair of sharp scissors or a scalpel, make an incision 

from the base of the left ventricle, up through the left 
atrium. 

■  Using a pair of forceps, remove any blood clots lying in the 

exposed chambers. 

■  Identify the main features as shown in Figure 9.4. 
■  If you have not cut open the aorta, gently push the handle of 

a blunt seeker or an old pencil, behind the bicuspid valve. It 
should fi nd its way into the aorta. Note how thick the wall of 
this blood vessel is. 

■  Compare the semi-lunar valves in the base of the aorta with 

the bicuspid valve between the atrium and ventricle. Note 
that the latter has tendons to prevent it turning inside-out.
■  Now repeat the procedure on the right side of the heart to 

expose the right atrium and ventricle. 

■  Pushing the handle of the seeker behind the tricuspid valve 
should allow it to enter the pulmonary artery. Cut open the 
artery to expose semi-lunar valves. Note the relative thinness 
of the wall, compared to that of the aorta. 

■  Also compare the thickness of the left ventricle wall to that of 

the right ventricle.

Investigating the effect of exercise 
on pulse rate
■  Find your pulse in your wrist or neck – see Figure 9.7. 
■  Count the number of beats in 15 seconds, then multiply the 

result by four to provide a pulse rate in beats per minute. This 
is your resting pulse rate. 

■  Repeat the process two more times and then calculate an 

average resting pulse rate. 

■  Carry out 2 minutes of exercise, e.g. running on the spot, 

then sit down and immediately start a stopwatch and 
measure your pulse rate over 15 seconds as before. 

■  Allow the stopwatch to keep timing. Measure your pulse rate 

every minute for 10 minutes. 

■  Convert all the readings to beats per minute. Plot a graph of 

pulse rate after exercise against time, with the fi rst reading 
being 0 minutes. 

■  Finally, draw a line across the graph representing your average 

resting pulse rate.

 9  TransporT in animals

Result 
The pulse rate immediately after exercise should be much 
higher than the average resting pulse rate. With time the pulse 
rate gradually falls back to the average resting pulse rate.

Interpretation
During exercise the muscles need more oxygen and glucose 
for aerobic respiration to provide the energy needed for the 
increased movement. The heart rate increases to provide 
these materials. After exercise, demand for oxygen and 
glucose decreases, so the pulse rate gradually returns to 
normal.

These are fairly wide vessels (Figure 9.15) which 
carry blood from the heart to the limbs and 
organs of the body (Figure 9.20). The blood in 
the arteries, except for the pulmonary arteries, is 
oxygenated.

Arteries have elastic tissue and muscle fi bres in 
their thick walls. The arteries divide into smaller 
vessels called arterioles.

The arterioles divide repeatedly to form a branching 
network of microscopic vessels passing between the 
cells of every living tissue. These fi nal branches are 
called capillaries.
Capillaries
These are tiny vessels, often as little as 0.001 mm 
in diameter and with walls only one cell thick 
(Figures 9.15(c) and 9.17). Although the blood as 
a whole cannot escape from the capillary, the thin 
capillary walls allow some liquid to pass through, 
i.e. they are permeable. Blood pressure in the 
capillaries forces part of the plasma out through 
the walls. 

The capillary network is so dense that no living 
cell is far from a supply of oxygen and food. The 
capillaries join up into larger vessels, called venules, 
which then combine to form veins.

Veins
Veins return blood from the tissues to the heart 
(Figure 9.20). The blood pressure in them is steady 
and is less than that in the arteries. They are wider 
and their walls are thinner, less elastic and less 
muscular than those of the arteries (Figures 9.15(b) 
and 9.18). They also have valves in them similar to 
the semi-lunar valves (Figure 9.13, page 129).

Figure 9.18  Transverse section through a vein and artery. The vein is on 
the right, the artery on the left. Notice that the wall of the artery is much 
thicker than that of the vein. The material filling the artery is formed from 
coagulated red blood cells. These are also visible in two regions of the vein.

Blood and lymphatic vessels

The blood in most veins is deoxygenated and 
contains less food but more carbon dioxide than 
the blood in most arteries. This is because respiring 
cells have used the oxygen and food and produced 
carbon dioxide (Figure 9.19). The pulmonary veins, 
which return blood from the lungs to the heart, are 
an exception. They contain oxygenated blood and a 
reduced level of carbon dioxide.

The main blood vessels associated with the heart, 

lungs and kidneys are shown in Figure 9.20. The 
right side of the heart is supplied by the vena cava 
(the main vein of the body) and sends blood to the 
lungs along the pulmonary artery. The left side of the 
heart receives blood from the lungs in the pulmonary 
vein and sends it to the body in the aorta, the main 
artery (see Chapter 11). In reality there are two 
pulmonary arteries and two pulmonary veins, because 
there are two lungs. There are also two vena cavae: 
one returns blood from the lower body; the other 
from the upper body. Each kidney receives blood 
from a renal artery. Once the blood has been filtered 
it is returned to the vena cava through a renal vein 
(see Chapter 13).
Blood pressure
The pumping action of the heart produces a 
pressure that drives blood around the circulatory 
system (Figure 9.20). In the arteries, the pressure 
fluctuates with the heartbeat, and the pressure wave 
can be felt as a pulse. The millions of tiny capillaries 
offer resistance to the blood flow and, by the time 
the blood enters the veins, the surges due to the 
heartbeat are lost and the blood pressure is greatly 
reduced.

Carries blood at high pressure – 
prevents bursting and maintains

near the heart, have a greater 
proportion of elastic tissue, which 
allows these vessels to stand up to 
the surges of high pressure caused 
by the heartbeat.

This helps to maintain blood 
pressure.

Although blood pressure varies with age and 
activity, it is normally kept within specifi c limits 
by negative feedback (see ‘Homeostasis’ in 
Chapter 14). The fi ltration process in the kidneys 
(Chapter 13) needs a fairly consistent blood 
pressure. If blood pressure falls signifi cantly 
because, for example, of loss of blood or shock, 
then the kidneys may fail. Blood pressure 
consistently higher than normal increases the risk 
of heart disease or stroke.

To prevent backfl ow of blood. 
Contraction of body muscles, 
particularly in the limbs, compresses 
the thin-walled veins. The valves in 
the veins prevent the blood fl owing 
backwards when the vessels are 
compressed in this way. This assists 
the return of venous blood to the 
heart.

This allows diffusion of materials 
between the capillary and 
surrounding tissues.

White blood cells can squeeze 
between cells of the wall. Blood 
cells pass through slowly to allow 
diffusion of materials and tissue fl uid.

Blood is still under pressure.

Arterioles, shunt vessels and venules
 Arterioles and shunt vessels
The small arteries and the arterioles have 
proportionately less elastic tissue and more 
muscle fi bres than the great arteries. When the 
muscle fi bres of the arterioles contract, they make 
the vessels narrower and restrict the blood fl ow

(a process called vasoconstriction). In this way, the 
distribution of blood to different parts of the body 
can be regulated. One example is in the skin. If the 
body temperature drops below normal, arterioles 
in the skin constrict to reduce the amount of blood 
fl owing through capillaries near the skin surface. 
Shunt vessels, linking the arterioles with venules, 
dilate to allow the blood to bypass the capillaries 
(Figure 9.21). This helps to reduce further heat loss.

The lymphatic system
Not all the tissue fl uid returns to the capillaries. 
Some of it enters blind-ended, thin-walled vessels 
called lymphatics (Figure 9.16). The lymphatics 
from all parts of the body join up to make two large 
vessels, which empty their contents into the blood 
system as shown in Figure 9.22.

The lacteals from the villi in the small intestine 

(Figure 7.24) join up with the lymphatic system, so 
most of the fats absorbed in the intestine reach the 
circulation by this route. The fl uid in the lymphatic 
vessels is called lymph and is similar in composition 
to tissue fl uid.

Some of the larger lymphatics can contract, but 

most of the lymph fl ow results from the vessels 
being compressed from time to time when the 
body muscles contract in movements such as 
walking or breathing. There are valves in the 
lymphatics (Figure 9.23) like those in the veins and 
the pulmonary artery (Figure 9.13), so that when 
the lymphatics are squashed, the fl uid in them is 
forced in one direction only: towards the heart. 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_9.indd   135

Blood and lymphatic vessels

At certain points in the lymphatic vessels there 
are swellings called lymph nodes (Figure 9.22). 
Lymphocytes are stored in the lymph nodes and 
released into the lymph to eventually reach the 
blood system. There are also phagocytes in the 
lymph nodes. If bacteria enter a wound and are not 
ingested by the white cells of the blood or lymph, 
they will be carried in the lymph to a lymph node 
and white cells there will ingest them. The lymph 
nodes thus form part of the body’s defence system 
against infection.

●● Blood
Blood consists of red cells, white cells and platelets 
fl oating in a liquid called plasma. There are between 
5 and 6 litres of blood in the body of an adult, and each 
cubic centimetre contains about 5 billion red cells.
Red cells
These are tiny, disc-like cells (Figures 9.24(a) and 
9.26) which do not have nuclei. They are made 
of spongy cytoplasm enclosed in an elastic cell 
membrane. In their cytoplasm is the red pigment 
haemoglobin, a protein combined with iron. 
Haemoglobin combines with oxygen in places 
where there is a high concentration of oxygen, to 
form oxyhaemoglobin. Oxyhaemoglobin is an 
unstable compound. It breaks down and releases its 
oxygen in places where the oxygen concentration 
is low (Figure 9.25). This makes haemoglobin very 
useful in carrying oxygen from the lungs to the 
tissues.

Blood that contains mainly oxyhaemoglobin is said 
to be oxygenated. Blood with little oxyhaemoglobin 
is deoxygenated.

Each red cell lives for about 4 months, after which 

it breaks down. The red haemoglobin changes to a 
yellow pigment, bilirubin, which is excreted in the 

bile. The iron from the haemoglobin is stored in the 
liver. About 200 000 million red cells wear out and 
are replaced each day. This is about 1% of the total. 
Red cells are made by the red bone marrow of certain 
bones in the skeleton – in the ribs, vertebrae and 
breastbone for example.

White cells
There are several different kinds of white cell 
(Figures 9.24(b) and 9.26). Most are larger than the 
red cells and they all have a nucleus. There is one white 
cell to every 600 red cells and they are made in the 
same bone marrow that makes red cells. Many of them 
undergo a process of maturation and development in the 
thymus gland, lymph nodes or spleen. White blood cells 
are involved with phagocytosis and antibody production.

Blood

Plasma
The liquid part of the blood is called plasma. It is 
water with a large number of substances dissolved in 
it. The ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride 
and hydrogen carbonate, for example, are present. 
Proteins such as fibrinogen, albumin and globulins 
make up an important part of the plasma. Fibrinogen 
is needed for clotting (see below), and the globulin 
proteins include antibodies, which combat bacteria 
and other foreign matter (page 149). The plasma will 
also contain varying amounts of food substances such 
as amino acids, glucose and lipids (fats). There may 
also be hormones (Chapter 14) present, depending 
on the activities taking place in the body. The 
excretory product, urea, is dissolved in the plasma, 
along with carbon dioxide.

The liver and kidneys keep the composition of 
the plasma more or less constant, but the amount 
of digested food, salts and water will vary within 
narrow limits according to food intake and body 
activities.

Table 9.2 summarises the role of transport by the 

blood system

nucleus can be seen clearly in the white cells.

Platelets
These are pieces of special blood cells budded off in 
the red bone marrow. They help to clot the blood at 
wounds and so stop the bleeding.

Note that the blood is not directed to a particular 
organ. A molecule of urea may go round the 
circulation many times before it enters the renal 
artery, by chance, and is removed by the kidneys.

White blood cells
The two most numerous types of white cells are 
phagocytes and lymphocytes.

The phagocytes can move about by a flowing action 

of their cytoplasm and can escape from the blood 
capillaries into the tissues by squeezing between the 
cells of the capillary walls. They collect at the site of an 
infection, engulfing (ingesting) and digesting harmful 
bacteria and cell debris – a process called phagocytosis 
(Figure 9.24(c)). In this way they prevent the spread 
of infection through the body. One of the functions of 
lymphocytes is to produce antibodies.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_9.indd   137

Clotting
When tissues are damaged and blood vessels cut, platelets 
clump together and block the smaller capillaries. The 
platelets and damaged cells at the wound also produce 
a substance that acts, through a series of enzymes, on 
the soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen. As a result 
of this action, the fibrinogen is changed into insoluble 
fibrin, which forms a network of fibres across the 
wound. Red cells become trapped in this network and 
so form a blood clot. The clot not only stops further 
loss of blood, but also prevents the entry of harmful 
bacteria into the wound (Figures 9.27 and 9.28).

The transfer of materials between 
capillaries and tissue ﬂ uid
The fl uid that escapes from capillaries is not blood, 
nor plasma, but tissue fl uid. Tissue fl uid is similar 
to plasma but contains less protein, because protein 
molecules are too large to pass through the walls of 
the capillaries. This fl uid bathes all the living cells of 
the body and, since it contains dissolved food and 
oxygen from the blood, it supplies the cells with 
their needs (Figures 9.16 and 9.19). Some of the 
tissue fl uid eventually seeps back into the capillaries, 
having given up its oxygen and dissolved food to 
the cells, but it has now received the waste products 
of the cells, such as carbon dioxide, which are 
carried away by the bloodstream. The tissue fl uid 
that doesn’t return to the capillaries joins the 
lymphatic system.

●● Extension work
Ideas about the circulatory system
There must have been knowledge of human internal 
anatomy thousands of years ago. This might have 
come, for example, from the practice of removing 
internal organs before the process of mummifi cation 

138

in Ancient Egypt. However, there seems to have 
been little or no systematic study of human anatomy 
in the sense that the parts were named, described or 
illustrated.

Some of the earliest records of anatomical study 

come from the Greek physician, Galen.

Blood

Galen (AD130–200)
Galen dissected goats, monkeys and other animals 
and produced detailed and accurate records. He 
was not allowed to dissect human bodies, so his 
descriptions were often not applicable to human 
anatomy.

The anatomical knowledge was important but the 
functions of the various parts could only be guessed 
at. It was known that the veins contained blood 
but arteries at death are usually empty and it was 
assumed that they carried air or, more obscurely, 
‘animal spirit’. Galen observed the pulse, but 
thought that it was caused by surges of blood into 
the veins.

Figure 9.29  Harvey’s demonstration of valves and one-way 
ﬂ ow in a vein. The vein is compressed and the blood expelled by 
running a ﬁ nger up the arm. The vein reﬁ lls, but only as far as the 
valve. (Compare with Figure 9.13, page 129.)

William Harvey (1578–1657)
In the 15th and 16th centuries, vague ideas about 
the movement of blood began to emerge, but it was 
William Harvey, an English physician, who produced 
evidence to support the circulation theory.

Harvey’s predecessors had made informed 

guesses, but Harvey conducted experiments to 
support his ideas. He noted that the valves in the 
heart would permit blood to pass in one direction 
only. So the notion that blood shunted back and 
forth was false. When he restricted the blood fl ow 
in an artery he observed that it bulged on the side 
nearest the heart, whereas a vein bulged on the side 
away from the heart.

Figure 9.29 shows a simple experiment that reveals 

the presence of valves in the veins and supports the 
idea of a one-way fl ow.

Harvey published his results in 1628. They were 
at fi rst rejected and ridiculed, not because anyone 
tried his experiments or tested his observations, 
but simply because his conclusions contradicted the 
writings of Galen 1500 years previously.

By 1654, Harvey’s theory of circulation was widely 
accepted but it was still not known how blood passed 
from the arteries to the veins. Harvey observed that 
arteries and veins branched and re-branched until the 
vessels were too small to be seen and suggested that the 
connection was made through these tiny vessels. This 
was confi rmed after the microscope had been invented 
in 1660 and the vessels were called ‘capillaries’.

The signifi cance of this history is that, although 

it is reasonable to make an informed guess at 
the function of a structure or organ, it is only by 
testing these guesses by experiment that they can be 
supported or disproved.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 9 you should know and understand the 
following:
•  The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels with a 

heart and valves to ensure one-way fl ow of blood.

•  The heart is a muscular pump with valves, which sends blood 

around the circulatory system.

•  The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood around 

the body.

•  The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the 

lungs.

•  The atria are thin walled and receive blood from veins.
•  The ventricles have thick muscular walls to pump blood 

through arteries.

•  Blood pressure is essential in order to pump blood around 

the body.

•  Arteries carry blood from the heart to the tissues.
•  Veins return blood to the heart from the tissues.
•  Capillaries form a network of tiny vessels in all tissues. Their 
thin walls allow dissolved food and oxygen to pass from the 
blood into the tissues, and carbon dioxide and other waste 
substances to pass back into the blood.

•  The main blood vessels to and from the heart are: vena 
cavae, pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries and aorta.

18  List the things you would expect to fi nd if you analysed a 

sample of lymph.

•  The lungs are supplied by the pulmonary arteries and veins.
•  The kidneys are supplied by the renal arteries and veins.
•  Heart activity can be monitored by ECG, pulse rate and 

stethoscope, which transmits the sound of valves closing.

•  Blockage of the coronary arteries in the heart leads to a heart 

attack.

•  Smoking, fatty diets, stress, lack of exercise, genetic 
disposition and age may contribute to heart disease.
•  Blood consists of red cells, white cells and platelets 

suspended in plasma.

•  Plasma transports blood cells, ions, soluble nutrients, 

e.g. glucose, hormones and carbon dioxide.

•  The red cells carry oxygen. The white cells attack bacteria 

by phagocytosis and production of antibodies. Platelets are 
needed to clot blood.

•  Fish have a single circulation; mammals have a double 

circulation, with advantages over a single circulation.

•  The heart contains atrioventricular and semi-lunar valves, 

preventing backfl ow of blood.

•  The left and right sides of the heart are divided by a septum, 

keeping oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separate.

Pathogens
Pathogens include many bacteria, viruses and some 
fungi, as well as a number of protoctista and other 
organisms. Pathogenic bacteria may cause diseases 
because of the damage they do to the host’s cells, 
but most bacteria also produce poisonous waste 
products called toxins. Toxins damage the cells in 
which the bacteria are growing. They also upset some 
of the systems in the body. This gives rise to a raised 
temperature, headache, tiredness and weakness, and 
sometimes diarrhoea and vomiting. The toxin produced 
by the Clostridium bacteria (which causes tetanus) is so 
poisonous that as little as 0.000 23 g is fatal.

dead organic matter) some are parasitic, obtaining 
their nutrients from living organisms. The hyphae 
of parasitic fungi penetrate the tissues of their host 
plant and digest the cells and their contents. If the 
mycelium spreads extensively through the host, it 
usually causes the death of the plant. The bracket 
fungus shown in Chapter 1, Figure 1.27, is the 
fruiting body of a mycelium that is spreading through 
the tree and will eventually kill it.

Many viruses cause diseases in plants and animals. 

Human virus diseases include the common cold, 
poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, chickenpox, 
herpes, rubella, infl uenza and AIDS (See ‘Sexually 
transmitted infections’ in Chapter 16). Tobacco 
mosaic virus affects tomato plants as well as tobacco. 
It causes mottling and discolouration of the leaves, 
eventually stunting the growth of the plant.

Fungus diseases such as blight, mildews or rusts (see 
Chapter 1, Figure 1.28) are responsible for causing 
considerable losses to arable farmers, and there is a 
constant search for new varieties of crop plants that 
are resistant to fungus disease, and for new chemicals 
(fungicides) to kill parasitic fungi without harming 
the host.

A few parasitic fungi cause diseases in animals, 

including humans. One group of these fungi 
cause tinea or ringworm. The fungus grows in 
the epidermis of the skin and causes irritation and 
infl ammation. One form of tinea is athlete’s foot, in 
which the skin between the toes becomes infected. 
Tinea is very easily spread by contact with infected 
towels or clothing, but can usually be cured quickly 
with a fungicidal ointment.

Transmission
Pathogens responsible for transmissible diseases can 
be spread either through direct contact or indirectly.

Direct contact 
This may involve transfer through blood or other 
body fl uids. HIV is commonly passed on by drug 
addicts who inject the drug into their bloodstream, 
sharing needles with other drug users. If one user 
injects himself, the pathogens in his blood will 
contaminate the syringe needle. If this is then used 
by a second drug user, the pathogens are passed on. 
Anyone cleaning up dirty needles is at risk of infection 
if they accidently stab themselves. Surgeons carrying 
out operations have to be especially careful not to be 
in direct contact with the patient’s blood, for example 
by cutting themselves while conducting an operation. 
A person with HIV or another sexually transmitted 
disease (see Chapters 15 and 16) who has unprotected 
sex, can pass on the pathogen to their partner through 
body fl uids. It used to be said that HIV could be 
transferred from one person to another through saliva, 
but this is now considered to be a very low risk.
●● Extension work
Malaria
About 219 million people suffer from malaria in 
over 100 countries (Figure 10.2). In 2010 there 
were an estimated 660 000 malaria deaths according 
to the World Health Organization.

The disease is caused by a protozoan parasite called 
Plasmodium which is transmitted from person 
to person by the bites of infected mosquitoes 
of the genus Anopheles. The mosquito is said to 
be the vector of the disease. When a mosquito

‘bites’ a human, it inserts its sharp, pointed 
mouthparts through the skin till they reach a 
capillary (Figure 10.3). The mosquito then injects 
saliva, which stops the blood from clotting. If the

malarial parasites.

The parasites reach the liver via the circulation and 
burrow into the liver cells where they reproduce. A 
week or two later, the daughter cells break out of 
the liver cells and invade the red blood cells. Here 
they reproduce rapidly and then escape from the 
original red cells to invade others (Figure 10.4). 

The cycle of reproduction in the red cells 

takes 2 or 3 days (depending on the species of 
Plasmodium). Each time the daughter plasmodia are 
released simultaneously from thousands of red cells 
the patient experiences the symptoms of malaria. 
These are chills accompanied by violent shivering,

followed by a fever and profuse sweating. With so 
many red cells being destroyed, the patient will also 
become anaemic (see ‘Diet’ in Chapter 7).

If a mosquito sucks blood from an infected person, it 
will take up the parasites in the red cells. The parasites 
reproduce in the mosquito and fi nally invade the 
salivary glands, ready to infect the next human.

Control
There are drugs which kill the parasites in the 
bloodstream but they do not reach those in the liver. 
The parasites in the liver may emerge at any time and 
start the cycle again. If these drugs are taken by a 
healthy person before entering a malarious country, 
they kill any parasites as soon as they are injected. 
This is a protective or prophylactic use of the drug.
Unfortunately there are now many mutant forms 

of Plasmodium that have developed resistance to 
these drugs.

A great deal of work has been devoted to fi nding 

an effective vaccine, without much success. Trials 
are currently taking place of a vaccine that may offer 
at least partial protection against the disease.

The most far-reaching form of malarial control 
is based on the elimination of the mosquito. It is 
known that mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant 
water and that the larvae hatch, feed and grow in the 
water, but have to come to the surface to breathe air.

Spraying stagnant water with oil and insecticides 

suffocates or poisons the larvae and pupae. Spraying 
must include not only lakes and ponds but any 
accumulation of fresh water that mosquitoes can 
reach, e.g. drains, gutters, tanks, tin cans and old 

car tyres. By draining swamps and turning sluggish 
rivers into swifter streams, the breeding grounds of 
the mosquito are destroyed.

Spraying the walls of dwellings with chemicals like 
DDT was once very effective because the insecticide 
remained active for several months and the 
mosquito picked up a lethal dose merely by settling 
on the wall. See page 324 for further details about 
the use of DDT and its effects on the environment.
However, in at least 60 countries, many species 

of Anopheles have developed resistance to these 
insecticides and this method of control is now far 
less effective. The emphasis has changed back to the 
removal of the mosquito’s breeding grounds or the 
destruction of the larvae and pupae.

Indirect contact
This may involve infection from pathogens on 
contaminated surfaces, for example during food 
preparation. Raw meat carries bacteria, which are 
killed if the meat is adequately cooked. However, 
if the raw meat is prepared on a surface that is then 
used for other food preparation, such as cutting 
up fruit or vegetables that are later eaten raw, then 
the pathogens from meat can be transferred to the 
fresh food. The person handling the food is also a 
potential vector of disease if he or she does not wash 
their hands after using the toilet, moving rubbish or 
handling raw produce. In Britain there have been 
serious cases where customers in butchers’ shops 
have been infected with the bacterium Escherichia 
coli (E. coli), because germs from raw meat were 
transferred to cooked meat unwittingly by shop 
assistants using poor hygiene practices. For example, 
in 1996, 21 people died after eating contaminated 
meat supplied by a butcher’s shop in Scotland.
Salmonella food poisoning
One of the commonest causes of food poisoning 
is the toxin produced by the bacteria Salmonella 
typhimurium and S. enteritidis. These bacteria live in 
the intestines of cattle, chickens and ducks without 
causing disease symptoms. Humans, however, may 
develop food poisoning if they drink milk or eat meat 
or eggs that are contaminated with Salmonella bacteria 
from the alimentary canal of an infected animal.

Intensive methods of animal rearing may 

contribute to a spread of infection unless care is taken 
to reduce the exposure of animals to infected faeces.

144

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_10.indd   144

8/18/14   9:47 PM

The symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea, 

vomiting and abdominal pain. They occur from  
12 to 24 hours after eating the contaminated food. 
Although these symptoms are unpleasant, the disease 
is not usually serious and does not need treatment 
with drugs. Elderly people and very young children, 
however, may be made very ill by food poisoning.

The Salmonella bacteria are killed when meat 

is cooked or milk is pasteurised. Infection is most 
likely if untreated milk is drunk, meat is not properly 
cooked, or cooked meat is contaminated with 
bacteria transferred from raw meat (Figure 10.5). 
Frozen poultry must be thoroughly defrosted before 
cooking, otherwise the inside of the bird may not get 
hot enough during cooking to kill the Salmonella.

It follows that, to avoid the disease, all milk should 

be pasteurised and meat should be thoroughly cooked. 
People such as shop assistants and cooks should not 
handle cooked food at the same time as they handle 
raw meat. If they must do so, they should wash their 
hands thoroughly between the two activities.

The liquid that escapes when a frozen chicken is 

defrosted may contain Salmonella bacteria. The dishes 
and utensils used while the bird is defrosting must not 
be allowed to come into contact with any other food.

Pathogens and transmission

Uncooked meat or poultry should not be kept 

alongside any food that is likely to be eaten without 
cooking. Previously cooked meat should never be 
warmed up; the raised temperature accelerates the 
reproduction of any bacteria present. The meat 
should be eaten cold or cooked at a high temperature.
In the past few years there has been an increase in 
outbreaks of Salmonella food poisoning in which the 
bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. Some scientists 
suspect that this results from the practice of feeding 
antibiotics to farm animals to increase their growth 
rate. This could allow populations of drug-resistant 
salmonellae to develop.

Salmonella bacteria, and also bacteria that cause 
typhoid, are present in the faeces of infected people 
and may reach food from the unwashed hands of the 
sufferer.

People recovering from one of these diseases may 

feel quite well, but bacteria may still be present in their 
faeces. If they don’t wash their hands thoroughly after 
going to the lavatory, they may have small numbers 
of bacteria on their fingers. If they then handle food, 
the bacteria may be transferred to the food. When 
this food is eaten by healthy people, the bacteria will 
multiply in their bodies and give them the disease.

 10  Diseases anD immunity

People working in food shops, kitchens and food-
processing factories could infect thousands of other 
people in this way if they were careless about their 
personal cleanliness.

Some forms of food poisoning result from poisons 

(toxins) that are produced by bacteria that get into 
food. Cooking kills the bacteria in the food but does 
not destroy the toxins that cause the illness. Only one 
form of this kind of food poisoning, called botulism, 
is dangerous. It is also very rare.

In the 1970s another genus of bacteria, 

Campylobacter, was identified as a cause of food 
poisoning. This bacterium causes acute abdominal 
pains and diarrhoea for about 24 hours. The sources 
of infection are thought to be undercooked meat, 
particularly ‘burgers’.

In summary, people who handle and prepare food 

need to be extremely careful about their personal 
hygiene. It is essential that they wash their hands 
before touching food, particularly after they have 
visited the lavatory (Figure 10.6). Hand-washing is 
also important after handling raw meat, particularly 
poultry (see Figure 10.5). Food on display in shops 
needs to be protected (Figure 10.7).

Some people carry intestinal pathogens without 

showing any symptoms of disease. These people are 
called ‘carriers’. Once identified, they should not 
be allowed to work in canteens or food-processing 
 factories.

Figure 10.6  Hygienic handling of food. Shop assistants avoid handling 
meat and shellfish with their fingers by using disposable gloves.

146

Figure 10.7  Protection of food on display. The glass barrier stops 
customers from touching the products, keeps flies off the food and helps 
stop droplets from coughs and sneezes falling on the food.

Contamination of water
If disease bacteria get into water supplies used for 
drinking, hundreds of people can become infected. 
Diseases of the alimentary canal, like typhoid and 
cholera (see ‘Alimentary canal’ in Chapter 7), are 
especially dangerous. Millions of bacteria infest the 
intestinal lining of a sick person.

Some of these bacteria will pass out with the 

faeces. If the faeces get into streams or rivers, the 
bacteria may be carried into reservoirs of water used 
for drinking. Even if faeces are left on the soil or 
buried, rainwater may wash the bacteria into a nearby 
stream.

To prevent this method of infection, drinking 

water needs to be purified and faeces must be made 
harmless, a process involving sewage treatment (see 
‘Conservation’ in Chapter 21).

Water treatment
On a small scale, simply boiling the water used for 
drinking will destroy any pathogens. On a large scale, 
water supplies are protected by (a) ensuring that 
untreated human sewage cannot reach them and (b) 
treating the water to make it safe.

The treatment needed to make water safe for 

drinking depends on the source of the water. Some 
sources, e.g. mountain streams, may be almost pure; 
others, e.g. sluggish rivers, may be contaminated.

The object of the treatment is to remove all  
micro-organisms that might cause disease. This 
is done by filtration and chlorination. The water 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_10.indd   146

8/18/14   9:47 PM

is passed through beds of sand in which harmless 
bacteria and protozoa are growing. These produce a 
gelatinous film which acts as a fine filter and removes 
pathogens.

Finally, chlorine gas is added to the filtered water 

and remains in contact with it for long enough to kill 
any bacteria that have passed through the filter. How 
much chlorine is added and the length of the contact 
time both depend on how contaminated the water 
source is likely to be. Most of the chlorine disappears 
before the water reaches the consumers.

The purified water is pumped to a high-level 
reservoir or water tower. These are enclosed to 
ensure that no pathogens can get into the water. The 
height of the reservoir provides the pressure needed 
to deliver the water to the consumer.

Waste disposal 
Waste from domestic or commercial premises should 
be stored in dustbins or garbage cans made of 
galvanised steel or strong plastic, with a closely fitted 
lid to exclude flies and keep out scavenging animals. 
If this is not done, pathogens will breed in the waste 
and become a source of disease organisms. The waste 
is taken away and disposed of by burning, or burying 
deep enough to prevent rats using it as food, or (less 
effectively) tightly packed to keep out flies and vermin.

Contamination by houseflies
Flies walk about on food. They place their 
mouthparts on it and pump saliva onto the food. 
Then they suck up the digested food as a liquid.

This would not matter much if flies fed only on 

clean food, but they also visit decaying food or 
human faeces. Here they may pick up bacteria on 
their feet or their mouthparts. They then alight 
on our food and the bacteria on their bodies are 
transferred to the food. Figure 10.8 shows the many 
ways in which this can happen.

Food poisoning, amoebic dysentery and polio can 

be spread by houseflies.

Tinea (‘ringworm’) – a fungal parasite
Several species of fungus give rise to the various 
forms of this disease. The fungus attacks the 
epidermis (see ‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14) 
and produces a patch of inflamed tissue. On the 
skin the infected patch spreads outwards and 
heals in the centre, giving a ring-like appearance 
(‘ringworm’).

The different species of tinea fungi may live on the 
skin of humans or domestic animals, or in the soil. 
The region of the body affected will depend on the 
species of fungus.

One kind affects the scalp and causes circular 

bald patches. The hair usually grows again when the 
patient recovers from the disease.

The species of fungus that affects the feet usually 

causes cracks in the skin between the toes. This is 
known as ‘athlete’s foot’.

Tinea of the crutch is a fungus infection, occurring 

usually in males, which affects the inner part of 
the thighs on each side of the scrotum. It causes a 
spreading, inflamed area of skin with an itching or 
burning sensation.

All forms of the disease are very contagious. That 
means, they are spread by contact with an infected 
person or their personal property. Tinea of the scalp 
is spread by using infected hairbrushes, combs or 
pillows. Tinea of the crutch can be caught by using 
towels or bedclothes contaminated by the fungus or 
its spores, and ‘athlete’s foot’ by wearing infected 
socks or shoes, or from the floors of showers and 
swimming pools.

When an infection is diagnosed, the clothing, 
bed linen, infected hairbrushes, combs or towels 
must be boiled to destroy the fungus. It is best, 
anyway, to avoid sharing these items as their owners 
may be carrying the infection without knowing or 
admitting it.

In young people, tinea infections often clear up 
without treatment. Where treatment is needed, a 
fungicide cream or dusting powder is applied to the 
affected areas of skin. Infected feet may be dipped 
in a solution of potassium permanganate (potassium 
manganate(vii)).

Amoebic dysentery
Entamoeba histolytica is a species of small amoebae 
that normally live harmlessly in the human intestine, 
feeding on food particles or bacteria. In certain 
conditions, however, Entamoeba invades the lining 
of the intestine causing ulceration and bleeding, 
with pain, vomiting and diarrhoea: the symptoms of 
amoebic dysentery.

The diarrhoea and vomiting lead to a loss of water 

and salts from the body and if they persist for very long 
can cause dehydration. Dehydration, if untreated, can 
lead to kidney failure and death. The treatment for 
dehydration is to give the patient a carefully prepared 
mixture of water, salts and sugar. The intestine absorbs 
this solution more readily than water and it restores 
the volume and concentration of the body fluids. This 
simple, effective and inexpensive treatment is called 
oral rehydration therapy and has probably saved 
thousands of lives since it was first discovered. There 
are also drugs that attack Entamoeba.

The faeces of infected people contain Entamoeba 

amoebae which, if they reach food or drinking water, 
can infect other people. The disease is prevalent in 
tropical, sub-tropical and, to some extent, temperate 
countries and is associated with low standards of 
hygiene and sanitation.

Airborne, ‘droplet’ or aerosol infection
When we sneeze, cough, laugh, speak or just breathe 
out, we send a fine spray of liquid drops into the 
air. These droplets are so tiny that they remain 
floating in the air for a long time. They may be 
breathed in by other people or fall on to exposed 
food (Figure 10.9). If the droplets contain viruses or 
bacteria, they may cause disease when they are eaten 
with food or inhaled.

Virus diseases such as colds, ‘flu, measles and 

chickenpox are spread in this way. So are the bacteria 
(Streptococci) that cause sore throats. When the water 
in the droplets evaporates, the bacteria often die as 
they dry out. The viruses remain infectious, however, 
floating in the air for a long time.

In buses, trains, cinemas and night clubs the air is 
warm and moist, and full of floating droplets. These 
are places where you are likely to pick up one of these 
infections.

Figure 10.9  Droplet infection. The visible drops expelled by this sneeze 
will soon sink to the floor, but smaller droplets will remain suspended in 
the air.

●● Defences against 

diseases

The body has three main lines of defence against 
disease. These involve mechanical barriers, chemical 
barriers and cells.

Mechanical barriers
Although many bacteria live on the surface of 
the skin, the outer layer of the epidermis (see 
‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14) seems to act as a 
barrier that stops them getting into the body. But if 
the skin is cut or damaged, the bacteria may get into 
the deeper tissues and cause infection.

Hairs in the nose help to filter out bacteria that are 

breathed in. However, if air is breathed in through 
the mouth, this defence is by-passed.

Chemical barriers
The acid conditions in the stomach destroy most 
of the bacteria that may be taken in with food. 
The moist lining of the nasal passages traps many 
bacteria, as does the mucus produced by the lining 
of the trachea and bronchi. The ciliated cells of 
these organs carry the trapped bacteria away from 
the lungs. 

148

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_10.indd   148

8/18/14   9:47 PM

Defences against diseases

Tears contain an enzyme called lysozyme. This 

dissolves the cell walls of some bacteria and so 
protects the eyes from infection.
Cells
When bacteria get through the mechanical and 
chemical barriers, the body has two more lines of 
defence – white blood cells and antibodies, produced 
by white blood cells. One type of white blood cells 
fights infection by engulfing bacteria (a process called 
phagocytosis) and digesting them. Further details 
of the way these work is also described in ‘Blood’ 
in Chapter 9. Another type produce antibodies that 
attach themselves to bacteria, making it easier for 
other white blood cells to engulf them.

Vaccination
The body’s defences can be enhanced by 
vaccination. This involves a harmless form of the 
pathogen (bacteria or virus) being introduced into 
the body by injection or swallowing. The presence 
of the pathogen triggers white blood cells to make 
specific antibodies to combat possible infection. If the 
person is exposed to the disease later, defences are 
already in place to prevent it developing (the person 
is immune to that disease). Without vaccination, 
white blood cells need to be exposed to the disease 
organism before they make the appropriate antibody. 
If the disease is potentially lethal, the patient could 
die before the white blood cells have time to act.

Antibodies and immunity

Key definition
Act ive immunity is the defence against a pathogen by 

 antibody production in the body.

On the surface of all cells there are chemical 
substances called antigens. Lymphocytes produce 
proteins called antibodies which attack the antigens 
of bacteria or any alien cells or proteins that invade 
the body. The antibodies may attach to the surface 
of the bacteria to mark them, making it easier for 
the phagocytes to find and ingest them, they may 
clump the bacteria together or they may neutralise the 
poisonous proteins (toxins) that the bacteria produce.
Each antibody is very specific. This means that an 

antibody that attacks a typhoid bacterium will not 

affect a pneumonia bacterium. This is illustrated in 
the form of a diagram in Figure 10.10.

Some of the lymphocytes that produced the 
specific antibodies remain in the lymph nodes 
for some time and divide rapidly and make more 
antibodies if the same antigen gets into the body 
again. This means that the body has become 
immune to the disease caused by the antigen and 
explains why, once you have recovered from measles 
or chickenpox, for example, you are very unlikely 
to catch the same disease again. This is called active 
immunity. Active immunity can also be gained by 
vaccination. You may also inherit some forms of 
immunity or acquire antibodies from your mother’s 
milk (see ‘Sexual reproduction in humans’ in 
Chapter 16). This is innate immunity.

Vaccination
When you are inoculated (vaccinated) against a 
disease, a harmless form of the bacteria or viruses is 
introduced into your body (Figure 10.11). The white 
cells make the correct antibodies, so that if the real 
micro-organisms get into the blood, the antibody is 
already present or very quickly made by the blood.

Figure 10.11  Vaccination. The girl is being vaccinated against rubella 
(German measles).

The material that is injected or swallowed is called a 
vaccine and is one of the following:
• a harmless form of the micro-organism, e.g. the 

BCG inoculation against tuberculosis and the 
Sabin oral vaccine against polio (oral, in this 
context, means ‘taken by mouth’)

• the killed micro-organisms, e.g. the Salk anti-polio 

vaccine and the whooping cough vaccine

•  a toxoid, i.e. the inactivated toxin from the bacteria, 

e.g. the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. (A toxin 
is the poisonous substance produced by certain 
bacteria, which causes the symptoms of the disease.)

B and T lymphocytes
There are two main types of lymphocyte. Both 
types undergo rapid cell division in response to the 
presence of specific antigens but their functions 
are different (though interdependent). The B cells 
(from Bone marrow) become short-lived plasma 
cells and produce antibodies that are released into 
the blood. These antibodies may attack antigens 
directly or stick to the surface membrane of infected 
or alien cells, e.g. cells carrying a virus, bacteria, 
cancer cells or transplanted cells.

150

‘Killer’ T cells (from the Thymus gland) have 
receptor molecules on their surface, which attach 
them to these surface antibodies. The T cells then 
kill the cell by damaging its cell membrane.

‘Helper’ T cells stimulate the B cells to divide 
and produce antibodies. They also stimulate the 
phagocytes to ingest any cells carrying antibodies on 
their surface.

Some of the B cells remain in the lymph nodes 
as memory cells. These can reproduce swiftly and 
produce antibodies in response to any subsequent 
invasion of the body by the same foreign organism. 
When mass vaccination fails, the population is at 
risk of infection with potential epidemics resulting. 
An example of this was with the MMR vaccine 
in Britain. MMR is a combination of vaccines 
protecting against measles, mumps and rubella 
(German measles). A researcher and surgeon called 
Andrew Wakefield claimed (incorrectly) to have 
found a link between the MMR vaccine and the 
incidence of autism and bowel disease in children. 
The story got into the national press and many 
parents reacted by refusing to allow their children 
to have the MMR vaccination, leaving them 
vulnerable to the three potentially life-threatening 
diseases. The drop in MMR vaccination rates left 
whole populations more susceptible to the spread 
of measles, mumps and rubella. There needs to be a 
significant proportion of a population immunised to 
prevent an epidemic of a disease, ideally over 90%. 
The percentage of people protected against measles, 
mumps and rubella dropped well below this figure in 
some areas after the MMR vaccine scare. It has taken 
years for doctors to restore parents’ faith in the safety 
of the MMR vaccine. 

There is a small risk of serious side-effects from 
vaccines, just as there is with all medicines. These 
risks are always far lower than the risk of catching 
the disease itself. For example, the measles vaccine 
carries a risk of 1 in 87 000 of causing encephalitis 
(inflammation of the brain). This is much less 
than the risk of getting encephalitis as a result of 
catching measles. Also, the vaccines themselves are 
becoming much safer, and the risk of side-effects is 
now almost nil.

Routine vaccination not only protects the 

individual but also prevents the spread of infectious 
disease. Diseases like diphtheria and whooping 
cough were once common, and are now quite rare. 
This is the result of improved social conditions 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_10.indd   150

and routine vaccination. Smallpox was completely 
wiped out throughout the world by a World Health 
Organization programme of vaccination between 
1959 and 1980.

Defences against diseases

Global travel
In the 18th and 19th centuries, explorers, traders 
and missionaries carried European diseases to 
countries where the population had no natural 
immunity. It is thought that devastating epidemics 
of smallpox and measles in, for example, North 
American Indians and Australian aborigines resulted 
from contact with infected Europeans. 

Today, the ease with which we can travel around 

the world raises the possibility that travellers may 
catch a disease in a region where it is endemic and 
subsequently introduce it into a region where the 
incidence of disease is low or non-existent.

An ‘endemic’ disease is one that is constantly 

present in a population. Figure 10.2 shows areas in 
which malaria is endemic. Small numbers of travellers 
returning to Britain from such a region may have 
become infected during their stay. Fortunately, 
British mosquitoes do not transmit malaria, but 
global warming might change this.

If you plan to visit a country where an infectious 

disease is endemic, you are likely to be offered advice 
on vaccination. There is no vaccine against malaria 
but, if you are travelling to a malarious country, 
you will probably be advised to take a drug (e.g. 
chloroquine) that kills malarial parasites, starting a 
week or more before your departure, throughout 
your stay and for a few weeks after your return. 
Drugs such as this, which help to prevent you getting 
a disease are called prophylactics.

Also, you may find your aircraft cabin being 

sprayed with insecticide to kill any malaria-carrying 
mosquitoes that might have entered.

If you visit a country where a disease, e.g. yellow 
fever, is endemic, you may be required to produce a 
certificate of vaccination (Figure 10.12) before being 
allowed into a country where the disease does not 
occur.

Passive immunity
Some diseases can be prevented or cured by injecting 
the patient with serum from a person who has 
recovered from the disease. Serum is plasma with

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_10.indd   151

Figure 10.12 

International certificate of vaccination

the fibrinogen removed. A serum is prepared from 
the plasma given by blood donors. People who 
have recently received an anti-tetanus inoculation 
will have made anti-tetanus antibodies in their 
blood. Some of these people volunteer to donate 
their blood, but their plasma is separated at once 
and the red cells returned to their circulation. The 
anti-tetanus antibodies are then extracted from the 
plasma and used to treat patients who are at risk of 
contracting tetanus, as a result of an accident, for 
example. Antibodies against chickenpox and rabies 
can be produced in a similar way.

The temporary immunity conferred by these 

methods is called passive immunity because the 
antibodies have not been produced by the patient. 
It is only temporary because it does not result in the 
formation of memory cells.

When a mother breastfeeds her baby, the milk 
contains some of the mother’s white blood cells, 
which produce antibodies. These antibodies provide 
the baby with protection against infection at a 
vulnerable time: the baby’s immune responses are 
not yet fully developed. However, this is another 
case of passive immunity as it is only short-term 
protection: memory cells are not produced.

Type 1 diabetes
This type of diabetes, also known as juvenile-
onset diabetes, mainly affects young people. It is 
due to the inability of islet cells in the pancreas 
to produce sufficient insulin. There is a slight 

151

 10  Diseases anD immunity

inherited tendency towards the disease, but 
it may be triggered by some event, possibly a 
virus infection, which causes the body’s immune 
system to attack the islet cells that produce 
insulin. It is therefore classed as an autoimmune 
disease. The outcome is that the patient’s blood 

is deficient in insulin and he or she needs regular 
injections of the hormone in order to control 
blood sugar levels and so lead a normal life. This 
form of the disease is, therefore, sometimes called 
‘insulin-dependent’ diabetes (see ‘Homeostasis’ 
in Chapter 14).

●● Extension work
Ideas about disease transmission and 
micro-organisms

Edward Jenner (1749–1823)
The history of immunisation centres on the disease 
smallpox, which is caused by a virus. Only a few 
years ago it was a serious, worldwide disease causing 
hundreds of thousands of deaths.

It had long been noticed that people who had 

recovered from smallpox never caught the disease 
again. In the late 1600s this observation was 
exploited in countries such as Greece, Turkey, 
China and India. Fluid from the blisters, which 
characterised the disease, was introduced into 
healthy people through cuts in the skin. The patient 
suffered a mild form of smallpox but was, thereafter, 
immune to the disease. It was a risky practice, 
however, and some people developed smallpox and 
died as a result of the vaccination.

In the 1750s, a Suffolk surgeon, Robert 

Sutton, refined the technique with considerable 
success. Edward Jenner is usually given the credit 
for smallpox vaccination. While using Sutton’s 
technique he noticed that milkmaids who had caught 
‘cowpox’ from infected cows did not develop the 
mild symptoms of illness after vaccination.

In 1796, Jenner conducted a crucial, if somewhat 

risky, experiment. He took fluid from a cowpox 
blister on a milkmaid’s hand and injected it into a 
young boy. Two months later, he inoculated the boy 
with smallpox and demonstrated that the boy was 
immune. After publication of the results, the practice 
spread widely throughout Europe, reducing deaths 
from smallpox by about two-thirds.

Jenner called his technique ‘vaccination’ to 

distinguish it from inoculation with smallpox. ‘Vacca’ 

is Latin for ‘cow’ and ‘vaccinia’ is the medical name 
for cowpox. We now know that viruses and bacteria 
often lose much of their virulence if they are allowed 
to pass through different animals or are cultured in 
a particular way. Such non-virulent microbes are said 
to be attenuated. Jenner and his contemporaries, of 
course, knew nothing about viruses or attenuation 
but their shrewd observations, logical deductions 
and bold experiments led to a massive reduction in 
suffering.

In 1967, the World Health Organization 

embarked on a programme to eradicate smallpox 
from the whole world. The strategy was to trace 
all cases of smallpox and isolate the patients so that 
they could not pass on the disease. Everyone at risk 
was then vaccinated. By 1987 the disease had been 
eradicated.

Louis Pasteur (1822–95)
Pasteur made outstanding contributions to 
chemistry, biology and medicine. In 1854, as 
professor of chemistry at the University of Lille, 
he was called in by the French wine industry to 
investigate the problem of wines going sour.

Under the microscope he observed the yeast cells 

that were present and proposed that these were 
responsible for the fermentation. Thus, he claimed, 
fermentation was the outcome of a living process in 
yeast and not caused solely by a chemical change in 
the grape juice. In time, Pasteur observed that the 
yeast cells were supplanted by microbes (which we 
now call ‘bacteria’), which appeared to change the 
alcohol into acetic and lactic acids.

Pasteur showed that souring was prevented by 
heating the wine to 120 °F (49 °C). He reasoned 
that this was because the microbes responsible for 
souring had been killed by the heat and, if the wine 
was promptly bottled, they could not return. This 
process is now called ‘pasteurisation’.

Spontaneous generation
The micro-organisms in decaying products could be 
seen under the microscope, but where did they come 
from? Many scientists claimed that they were the 
result of decay rather than the cause; they had arisen 
‘spontaneously’ in the decaying fluids.

In the 17th century, it was believed that organisms 

could be generated from decaying matter. The 
organisms were usually ‘vermin’ such as insects, 
worms and mice. To contest this notion, an 
experiment was conducted in 1668, comparing meat 
freely exposed to the air with meat protected from 
blowflies by a gauze lid on the container. Maggots 
appeared only in the meat to which blowflies had 
access. 

This, and other experiments, laid to rest theories 

about spontaneous generation, as far as visible 
organisms were concerned, but the controversy about 
the origin of microbes continued into the 1870s.
It was already known that prolonged boiling, 
followed by enclosure, prevented liquids from 
putrefying. Exponents of spontaneous generation 
claimed that this was because the heat had affected 
some property of the air in the vessel. Pasteur 
designed experiments to put this to the test.

He made a variety of flasks, two of which are 

shown in Figure 10.13, and boiled meat broth in 
each of them. Fresh air was not excluded from the 
flask but could enter only through a tube, which 
was designed to prevent ‘dust’ (and microbes) from 
reaching the liquid. The broths remained sterile 
until either the flask was opened or until it was tilted 
to allow some broth to reach the U-bend and then 
tipped back again.

Defences against diseases

Figure 10.13  Two of Pasteur’s flask shapes. The thin tubes admitted air 
but microbes were trapped in the U-bend.

This series of experiments, and many others, 
supported the theory that micro-organisms caused 
decay and did not arise spontaneously in the liquids.
The germ theory of disease
In 1865, Pasteur was asked to investigate the cause 
of a disease of silkworms (silk-moth caterpillars) that 
was devastating the commercial production of silk. 
He observed that particular micro-organisms were 
present in the diseased caterpillars but not in the 
healthy ones. He demonstrated that, by removing 
all of the diseased caterpillars and moths, the disease 
could be controlled. This evidence supported 
the idea that the microbes passed from diseased 
caterpillars to healthy ones, thus causing the disease 
to spread.

He extended this observation to include many 

forms of transmissible disease, including anthrax. He 
also persuaded doctors to sterilise their instruments 
by boiling, and to steam-heat their bandages. In this 
way, the number of infections that followed surgery 
was much reduced.

Pasteur’s discoveries led to the introduction of 
antiseptic surgery and also to the production of a 
rabies vaccine.

Defences against diseases

•  Antibodies, produced by lymphocytes, work by locking on 

to antigens.

•  Antigens have specific shapes, so each type of antigen 

needs a different antibody.

•  Active immunity is a defence against a pathogen by 

antibody production in the body.

•  Vaccination involves the administration of a dead or 

inactive form of the pathogen to a patient to stimulate 
antibody production.

•  Memory cells provide long-term immunity.
•  Systematic immunisation can protect whole populations.
•  Passive immunity only provides short-term protection 

because memory cells are not produced.

•  Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system targeting 

and destroying cells in the pancreas.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 10 you should know and understand  
the following:
•  Transmissible diseases are infections caused by viruses, 

bacteria, fungi or protoctista.

•  Infectious diseases may be transmitted by air, water, food  

or contact.

•  The body has defences against pathogens, including 

mechanical and chemical barriers and white blood cells.

•  A vaccine stimulates the blood system to produce antibodies 

against a disease, without causing the disease itself.

•  The presence of antibodies in the blood, or the ability to 

produce them rapidly, gives immunity to a disease.

•  Water-borne diseases are controlled by sewage treatment 

and water purification.

•  Food-borne diseases can be controlled by hygienic food 

preparation, hygienic handling and good personal hygiene. 
•  The spread of disease can be controlled by waste disposal 

and sewage treatment.

 ● Gas exchange in 

humans

All the processes carried out by the body, such as 
movement, growth and reproduction, require energy. 
In animals, this energy can be obtained only from 
the food they eat. Before the energy can be used by 
the cells of the body, it must be set free from the 
chemicals of the food by a process called ‘respiration’ 
(see Chapter 12). Aerobic respiration needs a supply 
of oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste 
product. All cells, therefore, must be supplied 
with oxygen and must be able to get rid of carbon 
dioxide.

In humans and other mammals, the oxygen is 
obtained from the air by means of the lungs. In 
the lungs, the oxygen dissolves in the blood and 
is carried to the tissues by the circulatory system 
(Chapter 9).
Characteristics of respiratory surfaces
The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide across 
a respiratory surface, as in the lungs, depends on the 
diffusion of these two gases. Diffusion occurs more 
rapidly if:
●  there is a large surface area exposed to the gas
●  the distance across which diffusion has to take place 

is small

●  there is a good blood supply, and
●  there is a big difference in the concentrations of the 

gas at two points brought about by ventilation.

Large surface area
The presence of millions of alveoli in the lungs 
provides a very large surface for gaseous exchange. 
The many branching fi laments in a fi sh’s gills have 
the same effect.

Protection of the gas exchange system against pathogens

Thin epithelium
There is only a two-cell layer, at the most, separating 
the air in the alveoli from the blood in the capillaries 
(Figure 11.4). One layer is the alveolus wall; the 
other is the capillary wall. Thus, the distance for 
diffusion is very short.

Good blood supply 
The alveoli are surrounded by networks of blood 
capillaries. The continual removal of oxygen by the 
blood in the capillaries lining the alveoli keeps its 
concentration low. In this way, a steep diffusion 
gradient is maintained, which favours the rapid 
diffusion of oxygen from the air passages to the 
alveolar lining.

The continual delivery of carbon dioxide from 
the blood into the alveoli, and its removal from 
the air passages by ventilation, similarly maintains 
a diffusion gradient that promotes the diffusion 
of carbon dioxide from the alveolar lining into the 
bronchioles.

Ventilation
Ventilation of the lungs helps to maintain a steep 
diffusion gradient (see ‘Diffusion’ in Chapter 3) 
between the air at the end of the air passages and the 
alveolar air. The concentration of the oxygen in the 
air at the end of the air passages is high, because the 
air is constantly replaced by the breathing actions.

The respiratory surfaces of land-dwelling mammals 

are invariably moist. Oxygen has to dissolve in 
the thin fi lm of moisture before passing across the 
epithelium.
Lung structure
The lungs are enclosed in the thorax (chest region) 
(see Figure 7.13). They have a spongy texture and 
can be expanded and compressed by movements 
of the thorax in such a way that air is sucked in and 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_11.indd   156

8/18/14   9:48 PM

blown out. The lungs are joined to the back of the 
mouth by the windpipe or trachea (Figure 11.1). 
The trachea divides into two smaller tubes, called 
bronchi (singular = bronchus), which enter the lungs 
and divide into even smaller branches. When these 
branches are only about 0.2 mm in diameter, they 
are called bronchioles (Figure 11.3(a)). These fine 
branches end in a mass of little, thin-walled, pouch-like 
air sacs called alveoli (Figures 11.3(b), (c) and 11.4).
The epiglottis and other structures at the top of 

the trachea stop food and drink from entering the air 
passages when we swallow.

Gas exchange in humans

Figure 11.2 shows a section through the thorax. The 
ribs, shown in cross section, form a cage, which has 
two main functions: 
●  to protect the lungs and heart
●  to move to ventilate the lungs.

The alveoli have thin elastic walls, formed from a  
single-cell layer or epithelium. Beneath the epithelium 
is a dense network of capillaries (Figure 11.3(c)) 
supplied with deoxygenated blood (see ‘Blood’ in 
Chapter 9). This blood, from which the body has taken 
oxygen, is pumped from the right ventricle, through the 
pulmonary artery (see Figure 9.20). In humans, there 
are about 350 million alveoli, with a total absorbing 
surface of about 90 m2. This large absorbing surface 
makes it possible to take in oxygen and give out carbon 
dioxide at a rate to meet the body’s needs.

Gaseous exchange
Ventilation refers to the movement of air into and 
out of the lungs. Gaseous exchange refers to the 
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which takes 
place between the air and the blood vessels in the 
lungs (Figure 11.5).

The 1.5 litres of residual air in the alveoli is 

not exchanged during ventilation and oxygen has 
to reach the capillaries by the slower process of 
diffusion. Figure 11.5 shows how oxygen reaches the 
red blood cells and how carbon dioxide escapes from 
the blood.

The oxygen combines with the haemoglobin in 
the red blood cells, forming oxyhaemoglobin (see 
‘Blood’ in Chapter 9). The carbon dioxide in the 
plasma is released when the hydrogencarbonate ions 
(—HCO3) break down to CO2 and H2O.

The capillaries carrying oxygenated blood from 
the alveoli join up to form the pulmonary vein (see 
Figure 9.20), which returns blood to the left atrium 
of the heart. From here it enters the left ventricle 
and is pumped all around the body, so supplying the 
tissues with oxygen.

Sometimes the word respiration or respiratory 
is used in connection with breathing. The lungs, 
trachea and bronchi are called the respiratory 
system; a person’s rate of breathing may be called 
his or her respiration rate. This use of the word 
should not be confused with the biological meaning 
of respiration, namely the release of energy in cells 
(Chapter 12). This chemical process is sometimes 
called tissue respiration or internal respiration to 
distinguish it from breathing.
Lung capacity and breathing rate
The total volume of the lungs when fully inflated 
is about 5 litres in an adult. However, in quiet 
breathing, when asleep or at rest, you normally 
exchange only about 500 cm3. During exercise 
you can take in and expel an extra 3 litres. There 
is a residual volume of 1.5 litres, which cannot be 
expelled no matter how hard you breathe out.

At rest, you normally inhale and exhale about 

12 times per minute. During exercise, the breathing 
rate may rise to over 20 breaths per minute and the 
depth also increases.

Breathing rate and exercise
The increased rate and depth of breathing during 
exercise allows more oxygen to dissolve in the blood 
and supply the active muscles. The extra carbon 
dioxide that the muscles put into the blood is 
detected by the brain, which instructs the intercostal 
muscles and diaphragm muscles to contract and 
relax more rapidly, increasing the breathing rate. 
Carbon dioxide will be removed by the faster, 
deeper breathing.

Oxygen in exhaled air
n  Place a large screw-top jar on its side in a bowl of water 

(Figure 11.6(a)). 

n  Put a rubber tube in the mouth of the jar and then turn the jar 

upside-down, still full of water and with the rubber tube still in it. 

n  Start breathing out and when you feel your lungs must be 
about half empty, breathe the last part of the air down the 
rubber tubing so that the air collects in the upturned jar and 
fills it (Figure 11.6(b)). 

n  Put the screw top back on the jar under water, remove the jar 

from the bowl and place it upright on the bench.

n  Light the candle on the special wire holder (Figure 11.6(c)), 

remove the lid of the jar, lower the burning candle into the jar 
and count the number of seconds the candle stays alight. 

n  Now take a fresh jar, with ordinary air, and see how long the 

candle stays alight in this.

(a)  Lay the jar on its side
      under the water.

(b)  Breathe out through
      the rubber tube and
      trap the air in the jar.

(c)  Lower the burning
      candle into the jar
      until the lid is
      resting on the rim.

Figure 11.6  Experiment to test exhaled air for oxygen

Results
The candle will burn for about 15–20 seconds in a large jar of 
ordinary air. In exhaled air it will go out in about 5 seconds.

Interpretation
Burning needs oxygen. When the oxygen is used up, the flame 
goes out. It looks as if exhaled air contains much less oxygen 
than atmospheric air.

Figure 11.7  Experiment to compare the carbon dioxide content of 
inhaled and exhaled air 

If after 15 seconds there is no difference in the appearance of the 
limewater in the two tubes, continue breathing through them for 
another 15 seconds.

Results
The limewater in tube B goes milky. The limewater in tube A 
stays clear.

Interpretation
Carbon dioxide turns limewater milky. Exhaled air passes through 
tube B. Inhaled air passes through tube A. Exhaled air must, 
therefore, contain more carbon dioxide than inhaled air.
Note 1: if the breathing process is carried out for too 

long, the limewater that had turned milky will revert to being 
colourless. This is because the calcium carbonate formed (milky 
precipitate) reacts in water with carbon dioxide to form calcium 
hydrogencarbonate, which is soluble and colourless.

Note 2: Hydrogencarbonate indicator is an alternative to 

limewater. It changes from red to yellow when carbon dioxide is 
bubbled through it.

n  Push a rubber tube into the mouth of the bottle to position A, 

shown on the diagram (Figure 11.8). 

n  Take a deep breath and then exhale as much air as possible 
down the tubing into the bottle. The final water level inside 
the bottle will tell you how much air you can exchange in one 
deep breath.

n  Now push the rubber tubing further into the bottle, to 

position B (Figure 11.8), and blow out any water left in the tube. 

n  Support the bottle with your hand and breathe gently in and 

out through the tube, keeping the water level inside and 
outside the bottle the same. This will give you an idea of how 
much air you exchange when breathing normally.

Investigating the effect of exercise 
on rate and depth of breathing
This investigation makes use of an instrument called a spirometer. 
It may be one as illustrated in Figure 11.9, or a digital version, 
connected to a computer. A traditional spirometer has a hinged 
chamber, which rises and falls as a person breathes through the 
mouthpiece. The chamber is filled with medical oxygen from a 
cylinder. There is a filter containing soda lime, which removes 
any carbon dioxide in the user’s breath, so that it is not re-
breathed. The hinged chamber has a pen attached (shown in red 
in Figure 11.9), which rests against the paper-covered drum of a 
kymograph. This can be set to revolve at a fixed rate so that the 
trace produced by the user progresses across the paper.

the lungs. (A) shows the position of the tube when measuring the 
maximum usable lung volume. (B) is the position for measuring the 
volume exchanged in gentle breathing.

Investigating the effect of exercise 
on carbon dioxide production
n  Half fill two clean boiling tubes with limewater. 
n  Place a drinking straw in one of the boiling tubes and gently 

blow into it, with normal, relaxed breaths. 

n  Count how many breaths are needed to turn the limewater 

milky. 

n  Now exercise for 1 to 2 minutes, e.g. running on the spot. 
n  Place a drinking straw in the second boiling tube, blowing into 

it as before. 

n  Count the number of breaths needed to turn the limewater milky.

Results 
The number of breaths needed after exercise will be less than 
before exercise.

Interpretation 
Cells in the body are constantly respiring, even when we are 
not doing physical work. They produce carbon dioxide, which is 
expired by the lungs. The carbon dioxide turns limewater milky. 
During exercise, cells (particularly in the skeletal muscles) respire 
more rapidly producing more carbon dioxide. This turns the 
limewater milky more rapidly.

Figure 11.9  A spirometer. This instrument measures the volume of air 
breathed in and out of the lungs and can be used to measure oxygen 
consumption.

n  A volunteer is asked to breathe in and out through the 

mouthpiece and the kymograph is set to revolve slowly. This 
will generate a trace, which will provide information about the 
volunteer’s tidal volume and breathing rate (each peak on the 
trace represents one breath and the depth between a peak 
and trough can be used to calculate the tidal volume).

n  Next, the volunteer is asked to take a deep breath with 
the mouthpiece removed, then breathe out through the 
mouthpiece for one long continuous breath. The depth 
between the peak and trough produced can be used to 
calculate the vital capacity.

n  Finally, the volunteer is asked insert the mouthpiece, then 

run on the spot or pedal an exercise bicycle, while breathing 
through the spirometer. The trace produced (Figure 11.10) 
can be used to compare the breathing rate and depth during 
exercise with that at rest. A study of the trace would also show 
a drop in the trace with time. This can be used to calculate the 
volume of oxygen consumed over time.

Results 
Tidal volume is about 500 cm3, but tends to appear higher if the 
person is nervous or influenced by the trace being created.

Vital capacity can be between 2.5 and 5.0 litres, depending on 

the sex, physical size and fitness of the person.

Figure 11.10  Spirometer trace taken during exercise 

The breathing rate at rest is around 12 breaths per minute. 
During exercise this increases and may reach 20 or more breaths 
per minute.

Note: this experiment makes use of medical oxygen. This has a 
high purity and is toxic if inhaled for a prolonged period of time. 
If the volunteer starts to feel dizzy while using the spirometer, he 
or she should remove the mouthpiece immediately and rest.

Ventilation of the lungs
The movement of air into and out of the lungs, 
called ventilation, renews the oxygen supply in 
the lungs and removes the surplus carbon dioxide. 
Horseshoe-shaped hoops of cartilage are present in 
the trachea and bronchi to prevent them collapsing 
when we breathe in. The lungs contain no muscle 
fibres and are made to expand and contract by 
movements of the ribs and diaphragm.

The diaphragm is a sheet of tissue that separates 

the thorax from the abdomen (see Figure 7.13). 
When relaxed, it is domed slightly upwards. The ribs 
are moved by the intercostal muscles. The external 
intercostals (Figure 11.11) contract to pull the ribs 
upwards and outwards. The internal intercostals 
contract to pull them downwards and inwards. 
Figure 11.12 shows the contraction of the external 
intercostals making the ribs move upwards.
 Inhaling
1  The diaphragm muscles contract and pull it down 

(Figure 11.13(a)).

2  The internal intercostal muscles relax, while the 
external intercostal muscles contract and pull the 
ribcage upwards and outwards (Figure 11.14(a)).

These two movements make the volume in the thorax 
bigger, so forcing the lungs to expand. The reduction 
in air pressure in the lungs results in air being drawn 
in through the nose and trachea. This movement of 
air into the lungs is known as ventilation.

 Exhaling
1  The diaphragm muscles relax, allowing the 

diaphragm to return to its domed shape 
(Figure 11.13(b)).

2  The external intercostal muscles relax, while the 
internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling the 
ribs downwards to bring about a forced expiration 
(Figure 11.14(b)).

The lungs are elastic and shrink back to their relaxed 
volume, increasing the air pressure inside them. This 
results in air being forced out again.

 11  Gas exchanGe in humans

The outside of the lungs and the inside of the 

thorax are lined with a smooth membrane called the 
pleural membrane. This produces a thin layer of 
liquid called pleural fluid, which reduces the friction

product of aerobic respiration. As a result, CO2 
builds up in the muscle cells and diffuses into the 
plasma in the bloodstream more rapidly. The brain 
detects increases in carbon dioxide concentration in 
the blood and stimulates the breathing mechanism 
to speed up, increasing the rate of expiration of the 
gas. An increase in the breathing rate also has the 
advantage of making more oxygen available to the 
more rapidly respiring muscle cells.

 Protection of the gas exchange system from 
pathogens and particles

Pathogens are disease-causing organisms (see 
Chapter 10). Pathogens, such as bacteria, and dust 
particles are present in the air we breathe in and are 
potentially dangerous if not actively removed. There 
are two types of cells that provide mechanisms to 
help achieve this. 

Goblet cells are found in the epithelial lining of 
the trachea, bronchi and some bronchioles of the 
respiratory tract (Figure 11.16). Their role is to secrete 
mucus. The mucus forms a thin fi lm over the internal 
lining. This sticky liquid traps pathogens and small 
particles, preventing them from entering the alveoli 
where they could cause infection or physical damage.

Ciliated cells are also present in the epithelial 
lining of the respiratory tract (Figure 11.16; see 
also ‘Levels of organisation’ in Chapter 2). They are 
in a continually fl icking motion to move the mucus, 
secreted by the goblet cells, upwards and away from 
the lungs. When the mucus reaches the top of the 
trachea, it passes down the gullet during normal 
swallowing.

goblet cell

ciliated cell

When the rubber sheet is pulled down, the volume 
inside the bell jar increases. This reduces the air 
pressure inside, making it lower than outside. The air 
rushes in, through the glass tubing, to equalise the 
air pressure, causing the balloons to infl ate.

 Differences in composition of inspired and 
expired air

Air in the atmosphere (which is breathed in) contains 
about 21% oxygen (see Table 11.1). Some of this is 
absorbed into the bloodstream when it enters the 
alveoli, resulting in a reduction of oxygen in exhaled 
air to 16% (the process of gaseous exchange in the 
alveoli does not remove all the oxygen from the 
air). Gas exchange relies on diffusion to transfer the 
oxygen into red blood cells and the air breathed 
in mixes with air that has not all been breathed 
out from the previous breath, so the process of gas 
exchange is not very effi cient.

The remaining 79% of the air consists mainly of 

nitrogen, the percentage composition of which does 
not change signifi cantly during breathing.

Inspired air contains 0.04% carbon dioxide. Cells 

of the body produce carbon dioxide as a waste 
product during aerobic respiration (see ‘Aerobic 
respiration’ in Chapter 12). The bloodstream carries 
carbon dioxide to the lungs for excretion. It diffuses 
across the walls of the alveoli to be expired. The 
percentage breathed out is 4%, 100 times greater 
than the percentage breathed in.

The lining of the alveoli is coated with a fi lm of 

moisture in which the oxygen dissolves. Some of this 
moisture evaporates into the alveoli and saturates 
the air with water vapour. The air you breathe out, 
therefore, always contains a great deal more water 
vapour than the air you breathe in. The presence of 
water vapour in expired air is easily demonstrated by 
breathing onto a cold mirror: condensation quickly 
builds up on the glass surface. The exhaled air is 
warmer as well, so in cold and temperate climates 
you lose heat to the atmosphere by breathing. 

 The relationship between physical activity and the 
rate and depth of breathing

It has already been stated that the rate and depth 
of breathing increase during exercise. In order for 
the limbs to move faster, aerobic respiration in the 
skeletal muscles increases. Carbon dioxide is a waste

6  During inhalation, which parts of the lung structure would 

you expect to expand the most?

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 11 you should know and understand 
the following:
•  Alveoli in the lungs are very numerous, provide a large 

surface area, have a thin, moist surface and are well-
ventilated for effi cient gas exchange.

•  Alveoli have a good blood supply.
•  Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli takes 

place by diffusion.

•  The blood in the capillaries picks up oxygen from the air 
in the alveoli and gives out carbon dioxide. This is called 
gaseous exchange.

•  The oxygen is carried around the body by the blood and 

used by the cells for their respiration.

•  The ribs, rib muscles and diaphragm make the lungs expand 

and contract. This causes inhaling and exhaling.

•  Air is drawn into the lungs through the trachea, bronchi and 

bronchioles.

•  Inhaled air contains a higher percentage of oxygen and 

a lower percentage of carbon dioxide and (usually) water 
vapour than exhaled air.

•  Limewater is used as a test for the presence of carbon 

dioxide. It turns milky.

•  During exercise, the rate and depth of breathing increase. 

•  Cartilage, present in the trachea, keeps the airway open 

and unrestricted.

•  The diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles 

play a part in ventilation of the lungs.

•  During exercise, the rate and depth of breathing increase. 

This supplies extra oxygen to the muscles and removes 
their excess carbon dioxide.

•  Movement of the ribcage and diaphragm results in 

volume and pressure changes in the thorax, leading to 
ventilation of the lungs.

•  During physical activity, increases in levels of carbon 

dioxide in the blood are detected in the brain, causing an 
increased rate of breathing.

•  Goblet cells make mucus to trap pathogens and particles 

to protect the gas exchange system.

•  Ciliated cells move mucus away from the alveoli.

●● Respiration
Most of the processes taking place in cells need 
energy to make them happen. Examples of energy-
consuming processes in living organisms are:
●  the contraction of muscle cells – to create 

movement of the organism, or peristalsis to move 
food along the alimentary canal, or contraction of 
the uterus wall during childbirth

●  building up proteins from amino acids
●  the process of cell division (Chapter 17) to create 
more cells, or replace damaged or worn out cells, 
or to make reproductive cells

●  the process of active transport (Chapter 3), 

involving the movement of molecules across a cell 
membrane against a concentration gradient 

●  growth of an organism through the formation of 

new cells or a permanent increase in cell size

●  the conduction of electrical impulses by nerve cells 

(Chapter 14)

●  maintaining a constant body temperature 

in homoiothermic (warm-blooded) animals 
(‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14) to ensure that 
vital chemical reactions continue at a predictable 
rate and do not slow down or speed up as the 
surrounding temperature varies.

This energy comes from the food that cells take in. 
The food mainly used for energy in cells is glucose.
The process by which energy is produced from 

food is called respiration.

Respiration is a chemical process that takes place 
in cells and involves the action of enzymes. It must 
not be confused with the process of breathing, which 
is also sometimes called ‘respiration’. To make the 
difference quite clear, the chemical process in cells is 
sometimes called cellular respiration, internal

respiration or tissue respiration. The use of the 
word ‘respiration’ for breathing is best avoided 
altogether.
●● Aerobic respiration

Key defi nition
Aerobic respiration is the term for the chemical reactions in 

cells that use oxygen to break down nutrient molecules to 
release energy.

The word aerobic means that oxygen is needed 
for this chemical reaction. The food molecules 
are combined with oxygen. The process is called 
oxidation and the food is said to be oxidised. All 
food molecules contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms. The process of oxidation converts the carbon 
to carbon dioxide (CO2) and the hydrogen to water 
(H2O) and, at the same time, sets free energy, which 
the cell can use to drive other reactions.

Aerobic respiration can be summed up by the 

equation

glucose + oxygen  enzymes  carbon + water + 2830 kJ
 
energy

dioxide 

The amount of energy you would get by completely 
oxidising 180 grams (g) of glucose to carbon dioxide 
and water is 2830 kilojoules (kJ). In the cells, the energy 
is not released all at once. The oxidation takes place in a 
series of small steps and not in one jump as the equation 
suggests. Each small step needs its own enzyme and 
at each stage a little energy is released (Figure 12.1).

Although the energy is used for the processes 

mentioned above, some of it always appears as heat. 
In ‘warm-blooded’ animals (birds and mammals) 
some of this heat is retained to maintain their body 
temperature.

In ‘cold-blooded’ animals (e.g. reptiles and fish) 
the heat may build up for a time in the body and 
allow the animal to move about more quickly. 
In plants the heat is lost to the surroundings (by 
conduction, convection and evaporation) as fast as it 
is produced.

Practical work

Experiments on respiration and 
energy
If you look below at the chemical equation that represents 
aerobic respiration you will see that a tissue or an organism that 
is respiring should be (a) using up food, (b) using up oxygen,

If we wish to test whether aerobic respiration is taking place:

n  ‘(d) giving out water’ is not a good test because non-living 
material will give off water vapour if it is wet to start with.

n  ‘(a) using up food’ can be tested by seeing if an organism loses 
weight. This is not as easy as it seems because most organisms 
lose weight as a result of evaporation of water and this may 
have nothing to do with respiration. It is the decrease in ‘dry 
weight’ that must be measured.

We will focus on the uptake of oxygen and the production of 
carbon dioxide as indications that respiration is taking place.

166

Seeds are often used as the living organisms because when 
they start to grow (germinate) there is a high level of chemical 
activity in the cells. Seeds are easy to obtain and to handle 
and they fit into small-scale apparatus. In some cases blowfly 
maggots or woodlice can be used as animal material. Yeast is 
useful when studying anaerobic respiration.

1  Using up oxygen during respiration
The apparatus in Figure 12.2 is a respirometer (a ‘respire 
meter’), which can measure the rate of respiration by seeing how 
quickly oxygen is taken up. Germinating seeds, or blowfly larvae 
or woodlice are placed in the test-tube and, as they use up the 
oxygen for respiration, the level of liquid in the delivery tubing 
will go up.

There are two drawbacks to this. One is that the organisms 

usually give out as much carbon dioxide as they take in oxygen. 
So there may be no change in the total amount of air in the 
test-tube and the liquid level will not move. This drawback is 
overcome by placing soda-lime in the test-tube. Soda-lime 
will absorb carbon dioxide as fast as the organisms give it out. 
So only the uptake of oxygen will affect the amount of air in 
the tube. The second drawback is that quite small changes in 
temperature will make the air in the test-tube expand or contract 
and so cause the liquid to rise or fall whether or not respiration is 
taking place. To overcome this, the test-tube is kept in a beaker 
of water (a water bath). The temperature of water changes far 
more slowly than that of air, so there will not be much change 
during a 30-minute experiment.

Control
To show that it is a living process that uses up oxygen, a similar 
respirometer is prepared but containing an equal quantity of 
germinating seeds that have been killed by boiling. (If blowfly 
larvae or woodlice are used, the control can consist of an 
equivalent volume of glass beads. This is not a very good control 
but is probably more acceptable than killing an equivalent 
number of animals.)

The apparatus is finally set up as shown in Figure 12.2 and left 
for 30 minutes (10 minutes if blowfly larvae or woodlice are used).
The capillary tube and reservoir of liquid are called a manometer.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_12.indd   166

8/18/14   9:48 PM

Result
The level of liquid in the experiment goes up more than in the 
control. The level in the control may not move at all.

Interpretation
The rise of liquid in the delivery tubing shows that the living 
seedlings have taken up part of the air. It does not prove that it 
is oxygen that has been taken up. Oxygen seems the most likely 
gas, however, because (1) there is only 0.03% carbon dioxide in 
the air to start with and (2) the other gas, nitrogen, is known to 
be less active than oxygen.

Figure 12.2  Experiment to see if oxygen is taken up in respiration

If the experiment is allowed to run for a long time, the uptake of 
oxygen could be checked at the end by placing a lighted splint in 
each test-tube in turn. If some of the oxygen has been removed 
by the living seedlings, the flame should go out more quickly 
than it does in the tube with dead seedlings.

2  Using up oxygen during respiration (alternative 
method)
A respirometer such as the one illustrated in Figure 12.2 is not 
an easy piece of apparatus to set up and collect data from. An 
alternative way of showing that oxygen is used up during respiration 
can be achieved using a simple respirometer (Figure 12.3). 

n  A larger invertebrate such as a locust, or a group of woodlice 

or blowfly maggots, is placed in the boiling tube (an 
alternative is a large plastic syringe, linked to the capillary 
tube with a short section of rubber or silicone tubing). The 
organisms are protected from the soda-lime by means of 
cotton wool or a wire gauze (soda-lime is caustic). 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_12.indd   167

Interpretation 
The movement of the water drop towards the organism 
shows that it is taking in air. By using a range of organisms 
(locust, woodlice, blowfly larvae, germinating seeds) the rates 
of uptake can be compared to see which is respiring most 
actively.

A control could be set up using the same apparatus, but with 

glass beads instead of the organism(s). The bubble may still move 
because the soda-lime will absorb any carbon dioxide in the air in 
the boiling tube, but the movement should be less than that for 
living organisms.

Mitochondria
It is in the mitochondria that the chemistry of 
aerobic respiration takes place (Chapter 2). The 
mitochondria generate a compound called ATP, 
which is used by the cell as the source of energy for 
driving other chemical reactions in the cytoplasm 
and nucleus.

3  Investigating the effect of temperature on the rate 
of respiration of germinating seeds

n  Use the same apparatus as shown in Experiment 2, but set up

such as a beaker (Figure 12.4). 

n  Use wheat grains or pea seeds that have been soaked for 

24 hours and rinsed in 1% formaldehyde (or domestic bleach 
diluted 1:4) for 5 minutes. These solutions will kill any bacteria 
or fungi on the surface of the seeds. 

n  Kill an equal quantity of soaked seeds by boiling them for 

5 minutes. 

n  Cool the boiled seeds in cold tap water; rinse them in bleach 
or formaldehyde for 5 minutes as before. These can be used 
as the control (or, alternatively, use an equivalent volume of 
glass beads).

n  Start with a water bath at about 20 °C and allow the seeds 
to acclimatise to that temperature for a few minutes before 
taking any readings. The initial and final positions of the 
water drop could be recorded on the capillary tube with a 
permanent marker or chinagraph pencil, or by sticking a 
small label onto the glass. The distance travelled can then be 
measured with a ruler. 

n  Repeat the procedure (introducing a new bubble each time) 
at a range of different temperatures, remembering to allow 
time for the seeds to acclimatise to the new conditions before 
taking further readings.

Results 
As the temperature is increased the rate of movement of the 
water bubble towards the seeds increases. The movement may 
stop at higher temperatures.

Interpretation 
As the temperature increases, the rate of respiration in the 
germinating seeds increases. This is because the enzymes 
controlling respiration are more active at higher temperatures. 
However, respiration may stop above around 40 °C because the 
enzymes become denatured if they get too hot.

Controlled experiments
In most biological experiments, a second experiment 
called a control is set up. This is to make sure that 
the results of the first experiment are due to the 
conditions being studied and not to some other 
cause that has been overlooked.

In the experiment in Figure 12.2, the liquid rising 

up the capillary tube could have been the result of 
the test-tube cooling down, so making the air inside 
it contract. The identical experiment with dead seeds 
– the control – showed that the result was not due to 
a temperature change, because the level of liquid in 
the control did not move.

The term ‘controlled experiment’ refers to the 

fact that the experimenter (1) sets up a control and 
(2) controls the conditions in the experiment. In 
the experiment shown in Figure 12.2 the seeds are 
enclosed in a test-tube and soda-lime is added. This 
makes sure that any uptake or output of oxygen 
will make the liquid go up or down, and that the 
output of carbon dioxide will not affect the results. 
The experimenter had controlled both the amount 
and the composition of the air available to the 
germinating seeds.

If you did an experiment to compare the growth 

of plants in the house and in a greenhouse, you 
could not be sure whether it was the extra light or 
the high temperature of the greenhouse that caused 
better growth. This would not, therefore, be a 
properly controlled experiment. You must alter only

Anaerobic respiration is much less efficient than 

aerobic respiration because it releases much less 
energy per glucose molecule broken down (respired).

and energy

4  Releasing energy in respiration

n  Fill a small vacuum flask with wheat grains or pea seeds that 

have been soaked for 24 hours and rinsed in 1% formaldehyde 
(or domestic bleach diluted 1:4) for 5 minutes. These solutions 
will kill any bacteria or fungi on the surface of the seeds. 
n  Kill an equal quantity of soaked seeds by boiling them for 

5 minutes. 

n  Cool the boiled seeds in cold tap water, rinse them in bleach 
or formaldehyde for 5 minutes as before and then put them 
in a vacuum flask of the same size as the first one. This flask is 
the control.

n  Place a thermometer in each flask so that its bulb is in the 

middle of the seeds (Figure 12.5). 

n  Plug the mouth of each flask with cotton wool and leave both 
flasks for 2 days, noting the thermometer readings whenever 
possible.

Result
The temperature in the flask with the living seeds will be 5–10 °C 
higher than that of the dead seeds.

Interpretation
Provided there are no signs of the living seeds going mouldy, 
the heat produced must have come from living processes in the 
seeds, because the dead seeds in the control did not give out any 
heat. There is no evidence that this process is respiration rather 
than any other chemical change but the result is what you would 
expect if respiration does produce energy.

one condition (called a variable) at a time, either 
the light or the temperature, and then you can 
compare the results with the control experiment.
A properly controlled experiment, therefore, 
alters only one variable at a time and includes a 
control, which shows that it is this condition and 
nothing else that gave the result.

●● Anaerobic respiration

Key definition
Anaerobic respiration is the term for the chemical reactions 

in cells that break down nutrient molecules to release 
energy without using oxygen.

The word anaerobic means ‘in the absence of 
oxygen’. In this process, energy is still released 
from food by breaking it down chemically but the 
reactions do not use oxygen though they do often 
produce carbon dioxide. A common example is the 
action of yeast on sugar solution to produce alcohol. 
The sugar is not completely oxidised to carbon 
dioxide and water but converted to carbon dioxide 
and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and 
is shown by the following equation:
glucose  enzymes  alcohol + carbon dioxide + 118 kJ 
 
energy

The processes of brewing and bread-making rely 
on anaerobic respiration by yeast. As with aerobic 
respiration, the reaction takes place in small steps and 
needs several different enzymes. The yeast uses the 
energy for its growth and living activities, but you can 
see from the equation that less energy is produced by 
anaerobic respiration than in aerobic respiration. This 
is because the alcohol still contains a great deal of 
energy that the yeast is unable to use.

Anaerobic respiration also occurs in muscles 

during vigorous exercise, because oxygen cannot 
be delivered fast enough to satisfy the needs of the 
respiring muscle cells. The products are different to 
those produced by anaerobic respiration in yeast. The 
process is shown by the following equation:

glucose 

 lactic acid

dead seeds

The lactic acid builds up in the muscles and causes 
muscle fatigue (cramp).

n  When cool, use the boiled water to make up a 5% solution of 

glucose and a 10% suspension of dried yeast.

suspension in a test-tube and cover the mixture with a thin 
layer of liquid paraffin to exclude atmospheric oxygen.

into clear limewater.

limewater

Result
After 10–15 minutes, with gentle warming if necessary, there 
should be signs of fermentation in the yeast–glucose mixture and 
the bubbles of gas escaping through the limewater should turn 
it milky.

Interpretation
The fact that the limewater goes milky shows that the yeast–
glucose mixture is producing carbon dioxide. If we assume  
that the production of carbon dioxide is evidence of respiration, 
then it looks as if the yeast is respiring. In setting up the 
experiment, you took care to see that oxygen was removed 
from the glucose solution and the yeast suspension, and the 
liquid paraffin excluded air (including oxygen) from the mixture. 
Any respiration taking place must, therefore, be anaerobic 
(i.e. without oxygen).

Control
It might be suggested that the carbon dioxide came from a 
chemical reaction between yeast and glucose (as between chalk 
and acid), which had nothing to do with respiration or any other 
living process. A control should, therefore, be set up using the 
same procedure as before but with yeast that has been killed by 
boiling. The failure, in this case, to produce carbon dioxide 
supports the claim that it was a living process in the yeast in the 
first experiment that produced the carbon dioxide.

respiration in organisms such as yeast is shown below:

This amount of energy released per mole of glucose 
respired is much less than that released in aerobic 
respiration (2830 kJ per mole).

During vigorous exercise, lactic acid may build 

up in a muscle. In this case it is removed in the 
bloodstream. The blood needs to move more 
quickly during and after exercise to maintain this 
lactic acid removal process, so the heart rate is 
rapid. On reaching the liver, some of the lactic acid 
is oxidised to carbon dioxide and water, using up 
oxygen in the process. After exercise has stopped, 
a high level of oxygen consumption may persist 
until the excess of lactic acid has been oxidised. 
This is characterised by deeper breathing (an athlete 
pants for breath). The build-up of lactic acid that is 
oxidised later is said to create an oxygen debt. 

Accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles results 

in muscular fatigue, leading to cramp.

Athletes and climbers who are used to working 

at low altitude (normal air pressure) have problems 
if they then perform at high altitude (low air 
pressure). High-altitude air has a lower percentage 
of oxygen, so an oxygen debt can be experienced 
much more easily than at low altitude. The problem 
can be resolved if the person spends time at high 
altitude before performing to allow the body to 
acclimatise (making more red blood cells and 
increasing blood volume).

●● Extension work
Metabolism
All the chemical changes taking place inside a cell 
or a living organism are called its metabolism. The 
minimum turnover of energy needed simply to keep 
an organism alive, without movement or growth, is 
called the basal metabolism. Our basal metabolism 
maintains vital processes such as breathing, 
heartbeat, digestion and excretion.

The processes that break substances down are 
sometimes called catabolism. Respiration is an 
example of catabolism in which carbohydrates 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_12.indd   170

8/18/14   9:48 PM

are broken down to carbon dioxide and water. 
Chemical reactions that build up substances are 
called anabolism. Building up a protein from 
amino acids is an example of anabolism. The energy 
released by the catabolic process of respiration is 
used to drive the anabolic reactions that build up 
proteins.

You may have heard of anabolic steroids in 

connection with drug taking by athletes. These 
chemicals reduce the rate of protein breakdown 
and may enhance the build-up of certain proteins. 
However, their effects are complicated and not fully 
understood, they have undesirable side-effects and 
their use contravenes athletics codes (see ‘Misused 
drugs’ in Chapter 15).

6  The effect of temperature on yeast respiration

n  Make some bread dough using flour, water and activated 

yeast (yeast in a warm sugar solution). 

n  Rub the inside of a boiling tube with oil (this makes it easier 

to remove the dough after the experiment). 

n  Use a glass rod or the end of an old pencil to push a piece of 
dough into the bottom of the boiling tube, so that the tube 
is about a quarter full of dough. 

n  Mark the height of the top of the dough on the boiling tube, 

using a chinagraph pencil or permanent marker pen. 
n  Place the boiling tube into a beaker of water set to a 

preselected temperature, e.g. 20 °C. 

n  Leave the dough for 20 minutes, checking to make sure the 

temperature of the water bath remains constant (adding 
warm or cold water to maintain this). 
n  Record the new height of the dough.
n  Repeat the procedure at different temperatures and compare 

the rate of rising of the bread dough.

Results 
The dough rises faster as the temperature is increased to 
35 or 40 °C. Higher temperatures slow down the rate. Low 
temperatures may result in no change in height of the dough.

Explanation 
Yeast respires anaerobically, producing carbon dioxide. This 
causes the dough to rise. The process is controlled by enzymes, 
which work faster as the temperature is increased to the 
optimum (around 35–40 °C). Higher temperatures cause the 
enzymes to denature (Chapter 5).

Hypothesis testing
You will have noticed that none of the experiments 
described above claim to have proved that 
respiration is taking place. The most we can claim 
is that they have not disproved the proposal that 
energy is produced from respiration. There are 
many reactions taking place in living organisms 
and, for all we know at this stage, some of them 
may be using oxygen or giving out carbon dioxide 
without releasing energy, i.e. they would not fit our 
definition of respiration.

This inability to ‘prove’ that a particular proposal is 
‘true’ is not restricted to experiments on respiration. It 
is a feature of many scientific experiments. One way in 
which science makes progress is by putting forward a 
hypothesis, making predictions from the hypothesis, 
and then testing these predictions by experiments.

A hypothesis is an attempt to explain some event 

or observation using the information currently 
available. If an experiment’s results do not confirm 
the predictions, the hypothesis must be abandoned 
or altered.

For example, biologists observing that living 

organisms take up oxygen might put forward the 
hypothesis that ‘oxygen is used to convert food to 
carbon dioxide, so producing energy for movement, 
growth, reproduction, etc.’ This hypothesis can be 
tested by predicting that, ‘if the oxygen is used to 
oxidise food then an organism that takes up oxygen 
will also produce carbon dioxide’. Experiment 1 on 
page 166 tests this and fulfils this prediction and, 
therefore, supports the hypothesis. Looking at the 
equation for respiration, we might also predict that 
an organism that is respiring will produce carbon 
dioxide and take up oxygen. Experiment 5 with 
yeast, however, does not fulfil this prediction and so 
does not support the hypothesis as it stands, because 
here is an organism producing carbon dioxide 
without taking up oxygen. The hypothesis will have 
to be modified, e.g. ‘energy is released from food by 
breaking it down to carbon dioxide; some organisms 
use oxygen for this process, others do not’.

There are still plenty of tests that we have not 
done. For example, we have not attempted to see 
whether it is food that is the source of energy and 
carbon dioxide. One way of doing this is to provide 
the organism with food, e.g. glucose, in which the

carbon atoms are radioactive. Carbon-14 (14C) is a 
radioactive form of carbon and can be detected by 
using a Geiger counter. If the organism produces 
radioactive carbon dioxide, it is reasonable to suppose 
that the carbon dioxide comes from the glucose.

C6H12O6 + 6O2 

This is direct evidence in support of the hypothesis. 
All the previous experiments have provided only 
indirect evidence. 

 Criteria for a good hypothesis

A good hypothesis must:
• explain all aspects of the observation
• be the simplest possible explanation
• be expressed in such a way that predictions can be 

made from it

• be testable by experiment.

Excretion
Excretory products: urea, carbon dioxide
Contents of urine
Urine output
Parts of urinary system

 G Excretion
Excretion is the removal from organisms of toxic 
materials and substances in excess of requirements. 
These include:
G  the waste products of its chemical reactions
G  the excess water and salts taken in with the diet
G  spent hormones.
Excretion also includes the removal of drugs or other 
foreign substances taken into the alimentary canal 
and absorbed by the blood. 

Many chemical reactions take place inside the 

cells of an organism in order to keep it alive. Some 
products of these reactions are poisonous and 
must be removed from the body. For example, 
the breakdown of glucose during respiration (see 
‘Aerobic respiration’ in Chapter 12) produces 
carbon dioxide. This is carried away by the blood 
and removed in the lungs. Excess amino acids are 
deaminated in the liver to form glycogen and urea. 
The urea is removed from the tissues by the blood 
and expelled by the kidneys.

Urea and similar waste products, like uric acid, 

from the breakdown of proteins, contain the element 
nitrogen. For this reason they are often called 
nitrogenous waste products.

During feeding, more water and salts are taken in 
with the food than are needed by the body. So these 
excess substances need to be removed as fast as they 
build up.

The hormones produced by the endocrine glands 

(Chapter 14) affect the rate at which various body 
systems work. Adrenaline, for example, speeds up 
the heartbeat. When hormones have done their job, 
they are modifi ed in the liver and excreted by the 
kidneys.

The nitrogenous waste products, excess salts and 

spent hormones are excreted by the kidneys as a 
watery solution called urine.

Excretory organs 
Liver
The liver breaks down excess amino acids and 
produces urea. The yellow/green bile pigment, 
bilirubin, is a breakdown product of haemoglobin 
(Chapter 9). Bilirubin is excreted with the bile into 
the small intestine and expelled with the faeces. The 
pigment undergoes changes in the intestine and is 
largely responsible for the brown colour of the faeces. 

Lungs
The lungs supply the body with oxygen, but they are 
also excretory organs because they get rid of carbon 
dioxide. They also lose a great deal of water vapour 
but this loss is unavoidable and is not a method of 
controlling the water content of the body (Table 13.1).

Kidneys
The kidneys remove urea and other nitrogenous waste 
from the blood. They also expel excess water, salts, 
hormones (Chapter 14) and drugs (Chapter 15).

Skin
Sweat consists of water, with sodium chloride and 
traces of urea dissolved in it. When you sweat, you 
will expel these substances from your body so, in one 
sense, they are being excreted. However, sweating is a 
response to a rise in temperature and not to a change 
in the blood composition. In this sense, therefore, 
skin is not an excretory organ like the lungs and 
kidneys. See ‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14 for more 
details of skin structure and its functions.

The kidneys
The two kidneys are fairly solid, oval structures. They 
are red-brown, enclosed in a transparent membrane 
and attached to the back of the abdominal cavity 
(Figure 13.1). The renal artery branches off from 
the aorta and brings oxygenated blood to them. 
The renal vein takes deoxygenated blood away from 
the kidneys to the vena cava (see Figure 9.20). A 
tube, called the ureter, runs from each kidney to the 
bladder in the lower part of the abdomen.

Key definition
Deamination is the removal of the nitrogen-containing part 

of amino acids to form urea.

The liver and its role in producing 
proteins
As well as being an excretory organ, the liver plays 
a very important role in assimilating amino acids. 
Assimilation means the absorption of substances, 
which are then built into other compounds in the 
organism. The liver removes amino acids from the 
plasma of the bloodstream and builds them up into 
proteins. Proteins are long chains of amino acids, 
joined together by peptide bonds (see Chapter 4 for 
details of protein structure). These include plasma 
proteins such as fibrinogen (Chapter 9), which have 
a role in blood clotting.

The need for excretion
Some of the compounds made in reactions in the 
body are potentially toxic (poisonous) if their 

Excretion

Water balance and osmoregulation
Your body gains water from food and drink. It loses 
water by evaporation, urination and defecation 
(Chapter 7). Evaporation from the skin takes 
place all the time but is particularly rapid when we 
sweat. Air from the lungs is saturated with water 
vapour, which is lost to the atmosphere every time 
we exhale. Despite these gains and losses of water, 
the concentration of body fluids is kept within 
very narrow limits by the kidneys, which adjust 
the concentration of the blood flowing through 
them. If it is too dilute (i.e. has too much water), 
less water is reabsorbed, leaving more to enter the 
bladder. After drinking a lot of fluid, a large volume 
of dilute urine is produced. On a cold day, sweating 
decreases so more water is removed from the blood 
by the kidneys, again increasing the volume of 
dilute urine.

If the blood is too concentrated, more water 
is absorbed back into the blood from the kidney 
tubules. So, if the body is short of water, e.g. after 
sweating profusely on a hot day, or through doing  
a lot of physical activity, or not having enough to 
drink, only a small quantity of concentrated urine  
is produced.

concentrations build up. Carbon dioxide dissolves 
in fluids such as tissue fluid and blood plasma to 
form carbonic acid. This increase in acidity can affect 
the actions of enzymes and can be fatal. Ammonia 
is made in the liver when excess amino acids are 
broken down. However, ammonia is very alkaline 
and toxic. It is converted to urea which is much less 
poisonous, making it a safe way of excreting excess 
nitrogen.

Microscopic structure of the 
kidneys
The kidney tissue consists of many capillaries and 
tiny tubes, called renal tubules, held together 
with connective tissue. If the kidney is cut down 
its length (sectioned), it is seen to have a dark, 
outer region called the cortex and a lighter, 
inner zone, the medulla. Where the ureter joins 
the kidney there is a space called the pelvis 
(Figure 13.2).

A nephron is a single glomerulus with its renal 

capsule, renal tubule and blood capillaries (see 
Figure 13.6).

are surrounded by kidney tubules sectioned at different angles. The light

The renal artery divides up into a great many 
arterioles and capillaries, mostly in the cortex 
(Figure 13.3). Each arteriole leads to a glomerulus. 
This is a capillary repeatedly divided and coiled, 
making a knot of vessels (Figure 13.4). Each 
glomerulus is almost entirely surrounded by a cup-
shaped organ called a renal capsule, which leads 
to a coiled renal tubule. This tubule, after a series 
of coils and loops, joins a collecting duct, which 
passes through the medulla to open into the pelvis 
(Figure 13.5). There are thousands of glomeruli in 
the kidney cortex and the total surface area of their 
capillaries is very great.

Function of the kidneys
The blood pressure in a glomerulus causes part of 
the blood plasma to leak through the capillary walls.

The red blood cells and the plasma proteins are 
too big to pass out of the capillary, so the fluid that 
does filter through is plasma without the protein, 
i.e. similar to tissue fluid (Chapter 9). The fluid thus 
consists mainly of water with dissolved salts, glucose, 
urea and uric acid. The process by which the fluid is 
filtered out of the blood by the glomerulus is called 
ultrafiltration.

The filtrate from the glomerulus collects in the 

renal capsule and trickles down the renal tubule 
(Figure 13.6). As it does so, the capillaries that 
surround the tubule absorb back into the blood 
those substances which the body needs. First, all the 
glucose is reabsorbed, with much of the water. Then 
some of the salts are taken back to keep the correct 
concentration in the blood. The process of absorbing 
back the substances needed by the body is called 
selective reabsorption.

Salts not needed by the body are left to pass on 
down the kidney tubule together with the urea and 
uric acid. So, these nitrogenous waste products, 
excess salts and water continue down the renal tube 
into the pelvis of the kidney. From here the fluid, 
now called urine, passes down the ureter to the 
bladder.

Table 13.2 shows some of the differences in 
composition between the blood plasma and the 
urine. The figures represent average values because

the composition of the urine varies a great deal 
according to the diet, activity, temperature and 
intake of liquid.

The bladder can expand to hold about 400 cm3 of 
urine. The urine cannot escape from the bladder 
because a band of circular muscle, called a sphincter, 
is contracted, so shutting off the exit. When this 
sphincter muscle relaxes, the muscular walls of the 
bladder expel the urine through the urethra. Adults 
can control this sphincter muscle and relax it only 
when they want to urinate. In babies, the sphincter 
relaxes by a reflex action (Chapter 14), set off by 
pressure in the bladder. By 3 years old, most children 
can control the sphincter voluntarily.
The dialysis machine (‘artificial 
kidney’)
Kidney failure may result from an accident involving 
a drop in blood pressure, or from a disease of the 
kidneys. In the former case, recovery is usually 
spontaneous, but if it takes longer than 2 weeks, the 
patient may die as a result of a potassium imbalance 
in the blood, which causes heart failure. In the case of 
kidney disease, the patient can survive with only one 
kidney, but if both fail, the patient’s blood composition 
has to be regulated by a dialysis machine. Similarly, 
the accident victim can be kept alive on a dialysis 
machine until his or her blood pressure is restored.

In principle, a dialysis machine consists of a 

long cellulose tube coiled up in a water bath. The 
patient’s blood is led from a vein in the arm and 
pumped through the cellulose (dialysis) tubing 
(Figures 13.7 and 13.8). The tiny pores in the 
dialysis tubing allow small molecules, such as those 
of salts, glucose and urea, to leak out into the water 
bath. Blood cells and protein molecules are too 
large to get through the pores (see Experiment 5, 
Chapter 4). This stage is similar to the filtration 
process in the glomerulus.

Figure 13.7  The principle of the kidney dialysis machine

To prevent a loss of glucose and essential salts from 
the blood, the liquid in the water bath consists of a 
solution of salts and sugar of the correct composition, 
so that only the substances above this concentration 
can diffuse out of the blood into the bathing solution. 
Thus, urea, uric acid and excess salts are removed.

The bathing solution is also kept at body 

temperature and is constantly changed as the 
unwanted blood solutes accumulate in it. The blood 
is then returned to the patient’s arm vein.

A patient with total kidney failure has to spend 
2 or 3 nights each week connected to the machine 
(Figure 13.8). With this treatment and a carefully 
controlled diet, the patient can lead a fairly normal 
life. A kidney transplant, however, is a better solution 
because the patient is not obliged to return to the 
dialysis machine.

The problem with kidney transplants is to find 
enough suitable donors of healthy kidneys and to 
prevent the transplanted kidney from being rejected.
The donor may be a close relative who is prepared 
to donate one of his or her kidneys (you can survive 
adequately with one kidney). Alternatively, the 
donated kidney may be taken from a healthy person 
who dies, for example, as a result of a road accident. 
People willing for their kidneys to be used after their 
death can carry a kidney donor card but the relatives 
must give their permission for the kidneys to be used.

The problem with rejection is that the body reacts to 
any transplanted cells or tissues as it does to all foreign 
proteins and produces lymphocytes, which attack and 
destroy them. This rejection can be overcome by:
•  choosing a donor whose tissues are as similar as 

possible to those of the patient, e.g. a close relative

•  using immunosuppressive drugs, which suppress 

the production of lymphocytes and their 
antibodies against the transplanted organ.

 The advantages and disadvantages of kidney 
transplants, compared with dialysis

Advantages
• The patient can return to a normal lifestyle – 

dialysis may require a lengthy session in hospital, 
three times a week, leaving the patient very tired 
after each session.

• The dialysis machine will be available for other 

patients to use.

•  Dialysis machines are expensive to buy and maintain.

Disadvantages
•  Transplants require a suitable donor – with a 
good tissue match. The donor may be from a 
dead person, or from a close living relative who 
is prepared to donate a healthy kidney (we can 
survive with one kidney).

•  The operation is very expensive.
•  There is a risk of rejection of the donated kidney – 

immunosuppressive drugs have to be used.

•  Transplants are not accepted by some religions.

substances produced by chemical reactions in the body or 
taken in with the diet.

Co-ordination is the way all the organs and systems 
of the body are made to work effi ciently together 
(Figure 14.1). If, for example, the leg muscles are 
being used for running, they will need extra supplies 
of glucose and oxygen. To meet this demand, the 
lungs breathe faster and deeper to obtain the extra 
oxygen and the heart pumps more rapidly to get the 
oxygen and glucose to the muscles more quickly.

The brain detects changes in the oxygen and carbon 

dioxide content of the blood and sends nervous 
impulses to the diaphragm, intercostal muscles and 
heart. In this example, the co-ordination of the 
systems is brought about by the nervous system.

The extra supplies of glucose needed for running 

come from the liver. Glycogen in the liver is changed 
to glucose, which is released into the bloodstream 
(see ‘Homeostasis’ on page 192). The conversion of 
glycogen to glucose is stimulated by, among other 
things, a chemical called adrenaline (see ‘Hormones 
in humans’ on page 190). Co-ordination by 
chemicals is brought about by the endocrine system.

The nervous system works by sending electrical 

impulses along nerves. The endocrine system depends 
on the release of chemicals, called hormones, from 
endocrine glands. Hormones are carried by the 
bloodstream. For example, insulin is carried from the 
pancreas to the liver by the circulatory system.

Figure 14.1  Co-ordination. The badminton player’s brain is receiving 
sensory impulses from his eyes, ears (sound and balance) and muscle 
stretch receptors. Using this information, the brain co-ordinates the 
muscles of his limbs so that even while running or leaping he can control 
his stroke.

●● Nervous control in 

humans

The human nervous system is shown in Figure 14.2. 
The brain and spinal cord together form the central 
nervous system. Nerves carry electrical impulses from 
the central nervous system to all parts of the body, 
making muscles contract or glands produce enzymes 
or hormones. Electrical impulses are electrical signals 
that pass along nerve cells (neurones).

Glands and muscles are called effectors because 

they go into action when they receive nerve impulses 
or hormones. The biceps muscle is an effector that 
flexes the arm; the salivary gland (see ‘Alimentary 
canal’ in Chapter 7) is an effector that produces saliva 
when it receives a nerve impulse from the brain.

The nerves also carry impulses back to the central 
nervous system from receptors in the sense organs of 
the body. These impulses from the eyes, ears, skin, etc. 
make us aware of changes in our surroundings or in 
ourselves. Nerve impulses from the sense organs to the 
central nervous system are called sensory impulses; 
those from the central nervous system to the effectors, 
resulting in action, are called motor impulses.

Nervous control in humans

The nerves that connect the body to the central 
nervous system make up the peripheral nervous 
system.
Nerve cells (neurones)
The central nervous system and the peripheral 
nerves are made up of nerve cells, called neurones. 
Three types of neurone are shown in Figure 14.3. 
Motor neurones carry impulses from the central 
nervous system to muscles and glands. Sensory 
neurones carry impulses from the sense organs 
to the central nervous system. Relay neurones 
(also called multi-polar or connector neurones) are 
neither sensory nor motor but make connections 
to other neurones inside the central nervous 
system.

Each neurone has a cell body consisting of a 

nucleus surrounded by a little cytoplasm. Branching 
fibres, called dendrites, from the cell body make 
contact with other neurones. A long filament of 
cytoplasm, surrounded by an insulating sheath, runs 
from the cell body of the neurone. This filament is 
called a nerve fibre (Figure 14.3(a) and (b)). The 
cell bodies of the neurones are mostly located in 
the brain or in the spinal cord and it is the nerve 
fibres that run in the nerves. A nerve is easily visible, 
white, tough and stringy and consists of hundreds of 
microscopic nerve fibres bundled together (Figure 
14.4). Most nerves will contain a mixture of sensory 
and motor fibres. So a nerve can carry many different 
impulses. These impulses will travel in one direction 
in sensory fibres and in the opposite direction in 
motor fibres.

Some of the nerve fibres are very long. The 

nerve fibres to the foot have their cell bodies in the 
spinal cord and the fibres run inside the nerves, 
without a break, to the skin of the toes or the 
muscles of the foot. A single nerve cell may have a 
fibre 1 m long.
The nerve impulse
The nerve fibres do not carry sensations like pain 
or cold. These sensations are felt only when a nerve 
impulse reaches the brain. The impulse itself is a 
series of electrical pulses that travel down the fibre. 
Each pulse lasts about 0.001 s and travels at speeds of 
up to 100 m s−1. All nerve impulses are similar; there 
is no difference between nerve impulses from the 
eyes, ears or hands.

We are able to tell where the sensory impulses have 
come from and what caused them only because the 
impulses are sent to different parts of the brain. 
The nerves from the eye go to the part of the brain 

182

concerned with sight. So when impulses are received 
in this area, the brain recognises that they have come 
from the eyes and we ‘see’ something.
The reflex arc
One of the simplest situations where impulses 
cross synapses to produce action is in the reflex 
arc. A reflex action is an automatic response to a 
stimulus. (A stimulus is a change in the external or 
internal environment of an organism.) It provides 
a means of rapidly integrating and co-ordinating 
a stimulus with the response of an effector (a 
muscle or a gland) without the need for thought 
or a decision. When a particle of dust touches 
the cornea of the eye, you will blink; you cannot 
prevent yourself from blinking. A particle of food 
touching the lining of the windpipe will set off a 
coughing reflex that cannot be suppressed. When 
a bright light shines in the eye, the pupil contracts 
(see ‘Sense organs’ later in this chapter). You cannot 
stop this reflex and you are not even aware that it is 
happening.

The nervous pathway for such reflexes is called a 
reflex arc. In Figure 14.5 the nervous pathway for  
a well-known reflex called the ‘knee-jerk’ reflex  
is shown.

One leg is crossed over the other and the muscles 

are totally relaxed. If the tendon just below the 
kneecap of the upper leg is tapped sharply, a reflex arc 
makes the thigh muscle contract and the lower part 
of the leg swings forward. 

The pathway of this reflex arc is traced in 

Figure 14.6. Hitting the tendon stretches the 
muscle and stimulates a stretch receptor. The 
receptor sends off impulses in a sensory fibre.  
These sensory impulses travel in the nerve to the 
spinal cord.

In the central region of the spinal cord, the 

sensory fibre passes the impulse across a synapse 
to a motor neurone, which conducts the impulse 
down the fibre, back to the thigh muscle (the 
effector). The arrival of the impulses at the muscle 
makes it contract and jerk the lower part of the 
limb forward. You are aware that this is happening 
(which means that sensory impulses must be 
reaching the brain), but there is nothing you can do 
to stop it.

called the grey matter. The white matter consists

the grey matter to the spinal nerves and others

will be running along the spinal cord connecting the 
spinal nerve fi bres to the brain. The spinal cord is 
thus concerned with:
●  refl ex actions involving body structures below the neck
●  conducting sensory impulses from the skin and 

muscles to the brain, and

●  carrying motor impulses from the brain to the 

muscles of the trunk and limbs.

In Figure 14.6 the spinal cord is drawn in transverse 
section. The spinal nerve divides into two ‘roots’ 
at the point where it joins the spinal cord. All the 
sensory fi bres enter through the dorsal root and the 
motor fi bres all leave through the ventral root, but 
both kinds of fi bre are contained in the same spinal 
nerve. This is like a group of insulated wires in the 
same electric cable. The cell bodies of all the sensory 

fi bres are situated in the dorsal root and they make a 
bulge called a ganglion (Figure 14.9).

In even the simplest refl ex action, many more 

nerve fi bres, synapses and muscles are involved than are 
described here. Figure 14.8 illustrates the refl ex arc that 
would result in the hand being removed from a painful 
stimulus. On the left side of the spinal cord, an incoming 
sensory fi bre makes its fi rst synapse with a relay 
neurone. This can pass the impulse on to many other 
motor neurones, although only one is shown in the 
diagram. On the right side of the spinal cord, some of 
the incoming sensory fi bres are shown making synapses 
with neurones that send nerve fi bres to the brain, thus 
keeping the brain informed about events in the body. 
Also, nerve fi bres from the brain make synapses with 
motor neurones in the spinal cord so that ‘commands’ 
from the brain can be sent to muscles of the body.

Refl exes
The refl ex just described is a spinal refl ex. The brain, 
theoretically, is not needed for it to happen. Responses 
that take place in the head, such as blinking, coughing 
and iris contraction, have their refl ex arcs in the brain, 
but may still not be consciously controlled.

Bright light stimulates the light-sensitive cells of 
the retina. The nerve impulses in the sensory fi bres 
from these receptors travel through the optic nerve 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_14.indd   184

8/18/14   9:49 PM

Nervous control in humans

to the brain. In the mid-brain the fibres synapse with 
relay and motor fibres, which carry impulses back 
through the optic nerve to the circular muscle of the 
iris and stimulate it to contract.
Synapses

Key definition
A synapse is a junction between two neurones.

Although nerve fibres are insulated, it is necessary 
for impulses to pass from one neurone to another. 
An impulse from the fingertips has to pass through 
at least three neurones before reaching the brain and 
so produce a conscious sensation. The regions where 
impulses are able to cross from one neurone to the 
next are called synapses.

Voluntary and involuntary actions
 Voluntary actions
A voluntary action starts in the brain. It may be the 
result of external events, such as seeing a book on 
the floor, but any resulting action, such as picking up 
the book, is entirely voluntary. Unlike a reflex action 
it does not happen automatically; you can decide 
whether or not you carry out the action.

The brain sends motor impulses down the spinal cord 

in the nerve fibres. These make synapses with motor 
fibres, which enter spinal nerves and make connections 
to the sets of muscles needed to produce effective 
action. Many sets of muscles in the arms, legs and trunk 
would be brought into play in order to stoop and pick 
up the book, and impulses passing between the eyes, 
brain and arm would direct the hand to the right place 
and ‘tell’ the fingers when to close on the book.

One of the main functions of the brain is to co-
ordinate these actions so that they happen in the 
right sequence and at the right time and place.

 Involuntary actions
The reflex closure of the iris (see ‘Sense organs’ later in 
this chapter) protects the retina from bright light; the 
withdrawal reflex removes the hand from a dangerously 
hot object; the coughing reflex dislodges a foreign 
particle from the windpipe. Thus, these reflexes have a 
protective function and all are involuntary actions.
There are many other reflexes going on inside 
our bodies. We are usually unaware of these, but 
they maintain our blood pressure, breathing rate, 
heartbeat, etc. and so maintain the body processes.

How a synapse transmits an 
electrical impulse
At a synapse, a branch at the end of one fibre is 
in close contact with the cell body or dendrite of 
another neurone (Figure 14.10).

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_14.indd   185

When an impulse arrives at the synapse, vesicles 

in the cytoplasm release a tiny amount of the 
neurotransmitter substance. It rapidly diffuses across 
the gap (also known as the synaptic cleft) and binds 
with neurotransmitter receptor molecules in the 
membrane of the neurone on the other side of the 
synapse. This then sets off an impulse in the neurone. 
Sometimes several impulses have to arrive at the 
synapse before enough transmitter substance is released 
to cause an impulse to be fired off in the next neurone. 

Synapses control the direction of impulses 
because neurotransmitter substances are only 
synthesised on one side of the synapse, while 
receptor molecules are only present on the other 
side. They slow down the speed of nerve impulses 
slightly because of the time taken for the chemical 
to diffuse across the synaptic gap.

Many drugs produce their effects by interacting 

with receptor molecules at synapses. Heroin,  
for example, stimulates receptor molecules in 
synapses in the brain, triggering the release of 
dopamine (a neurotransmitter), which gives a  
short-lived ‘high’.

Spider toxin, and also the toxin released by tetanus 

(an infection caused by Clostridium bacteria), 
breaks down vesicles, releasing massive amounts of 
transmitter substance and disrupting normal synaptic 
function. Symptoms caused by the tetanus toxin 
include muscle spasms, lock-jaw and heart failure.

●● Sense organs

Key definition
Sense organs are groups of sensory cells responding to 

specific stimuli, such as light, sound, touch, temperature 
and chemicals.

Our senses make us aware of changes in our 
surroundings and in our own bodies. We have sense 
cells that respond to stimuli (singular = stimulus). A 
stimulus is a change in light, temperature, pressure, 
etc., which produces a reaction in a living organism. 
Structures that detect stimuli are called receptors. 
Some of these receptors are scattered through the 
skin: this organ has a number of different types of 
receptor, as shown in Figure 14.21. Other receptors 
are concentrated into special sense organs such as 
the eye and the ear. Table 14.1 gives examples of 
these and their stimuli.

The special property of sensory cells and sense organs 
is that they are able to convert one form of energy to 
another. The eyes can convert light energy into the 
electrical energy of a nerve impulse. The ears convert 
the energy in sound vibrations into nerve impulses. The 
forms of energy that make up the stimuli may be very 
different, e.g. mechanical, chemical, light, but they are all 
transduced into pulses of electrical energy in the nerves.
When a receptor responds to a stimulus, it sends a 
nerve impulse to the brain, which makes us aware of 
the sensation.
The eye
Note: details of conjunctiva, humours, choroid and 
tear glands are not a syllabus requirement, but are 
included here to put parts seen in a diagram of the 
eye in context.

The structure of the eye is shown in Figures 14.11 

and 14.12. The sclera is the tough, white outer 
coating. The front part of the sclera is clear and 
allows light to enter the eye. This part is called the 
cornea. The conjunctiva is a thin epithelium, which 
lines the inside of the eyelids and the front of the 

sclera and is continuous with the epithelium of  
the cornea.

The eye contains a clear liquid whose outward 

pressure on the sclera keeps the spherical shape of the 
eyeball. The liquid behind the lens is jelly-like and 
called vitreous humour. The aqueous humour in 
front of the lens is watery.

The lens is a transparent structure, held in place 
by a ring of fibres called the suspensory ligament. 
Unlike the lens of a camera or a telescope, the eye 
lens is flexible and can change its shape. In front of 
the lens is a disc of tissue called the iris. It is the iris 
we refer to when we describe the colour of the eye 
as brown or blue. The iris controls how much light 
enters the pupil, which is a hole in the centre of the 
iris. The pupil lets in light to the rest of the eye.

The pupil looks black because all the light entering 

the eye is absorbed by the black pigment in the 
choroid. The choroid layer, which contains many 
blood vessels, lies between the retina and the sclera. 
In the front of the eyeball, it forms the iris and  
the ciliary body. The ciliary body produces  
aqueous humour.

The internal lining at the back of the eye is the 

retina and it consists of many thousands of cells that 
respond to light. When light falls on these cells, they 
send off nervous impulses, which travel in nerve fibres, 
through the optic nerve, to the brain and so give rise 
to the sensation of sight. The part of the retina lying 
directly in front of the optic nerve contains no light-
sensitive cells. This region is called the blind spot.
Tear glands under the top eyelid produce tear 

fluid. This is a dilute solution of sodium chloride and 
sodium hydrogencarbonate. The fluid is spread over 
the eye surface by the blinking of the eyelids, keeping 
the surface moist and washing away any dust particles 
or foreign bodies. Tear fluid also contains an enzyme, 
lysozyme, which attacks bacteria.

Table 14.2 gives the functions of the parts of the 

eye required for the Core section of the syllabus.

The cornea and the aqueous and vitreous humours 

are mainly responsible for the refraction of light. 
The lens makes the final adjustments to the focus 
(Figure 14.13(b)).

The pattern of sensory cells stimulated by the 
image will produce a pattern of nerve impulses 
sent to the brain. The brain interprets this pattern, 
using past experience and learning, and forms an 
impression of the size, distance and upright nature of 
the object.

Vision
Light from an object produces a focused image 
on the retina (like a ‘picture’ on a cinema screen) 
(Figures 14.13 and 14.17). The curved surfaces  
of the cornea and lens both refract (‘bend’) the 
light rays that enter the eye, in such a way that  
each ‘point of light’ from the object forms a ‘point 
of light’ on the retina. These points of light will 
form an image, upside-down and smaller than  
the object.

The pupil reflex
The change in size of the pupil is caused by 
exposure of the eye to different light intensities. 
It is an automatic reaction: you cannot control it. 
When bright light falls on the eye, the iris responds 
by making the diameter of the pupil smaller. This 
restricts the amount of light reaching the retina, 
which contains the light-sensitive cells. If dim light 
falls on the eye, the iris responds by making the 
diameter of the pupil larger, so that as much light  
as is available can reach the retina to stimulate  
the light-sensitive cells. Figure 14.12 shows an  
eye exposed to bright light: the pupil is small.  
It would become much larger if the light intensity 
was reduced.

Image formation on the retina

 Control of light intensity
This section gives more detail about the roles of the 
iris and pupil in controlling light intensity falling on 
the retina, needed if you are following the extended 
syllabus.

The amount of light entering the eye is controlled 
by altering the size of the pupil (Figure 14.14). If the 
light intensity is high, it causes a contraction in a ring of 
muscle fi bres (circular muscle) in the iris. This reduces 
the size of the pupil and cuts down the intensity of 
light entering the eye. High-intensity light can damage 
the retina, so this reaction has a protective function.
In low light intensities, the circular muscle of 

the iris relaxes and radial muscle fi bres (which are 
arranged like the spokes of a bicycle wheel) contract. 
This makes the pupil enlarge and allows more 
light to enter. The circular and radial muscles act 
antagonistically. This means that they oppose each 
other in their actions – when the circular muscles 
contract they constrict the pupil and when the radial 
muscles contract the pupil dilates.

The change in size of the pupil is caused by 
an automatic refl ex action; you cannot control 
it consciously.

 Accommodation (focusing)
The eye can produce a focused image of either a near 
object or a distant object. To do this the lens changes 
its shape, becoming thinner for distant objects and 
fatter for near objects. This change in shape is caused 
by contracting or relaxing the ciliary muscle, which 
forms a circular band of muscle in the ciliary body 
(Figure 14.15). When the ciliary muscle is relaxed, 
the outward pressure of the humours on the sclera 
pulls on the suspensory ligament and stretches the 
lens to its thin shape. The eye is now accommodated 
(i.e. focused) for distant objects (Figures 14.15(a) and 
14.16(a)). To focus a near object, the ciliary muscle 
contracts to a smaller circle and this takes the tension 
out of the suspensory ligament (Figures 14.15(b) and 
14.16(b)). The lens is elastic and fl exible and so is 
able to change to its fatter shape. This shape is better 
at bending the light rays from a close object.

 Retina
The millions of light-sensitive cells in the retina are 
of two kinds, the rods and the cones (according to 
shape). The cones enable us to distinguish colours, but 
the rods are more sensitive to low intensities of light 
and therefore play an important part in night vision 
when the light intensity is not suffi cient to stimulate 
the cone cells. Images formed at night appear as 
shades of grey, with no bright colours detected. There 
are thought to be three types of cone cell. One type 
responds best to red light, one to green and one to 
blue. If all three types are equally stimulated we get 
the sensation of white. The cone cells are concentrated 
in a central part of the retina, called the fovea 
(Figure 14.11); when you study an object closely you 
are making its image fall on the fovea.

Fovea
It is in the fovea that the image on the retina is 
analysed in detail. Only objects within a 2° cone 
from the eye form an image on the fovea. This 
means that only about two letters in any word on 
this page can be seen in detail. It is the constant 
scanning movements of the eye that enable you to 

build up an accurate ‘picture’ of a scene. The centre 
of the fovea contains only cones: it is here that 
colour discrimination occurs.

 Blind spot
At the point where the optic nerve leaves the retina, 
there are no sensory cells and so no information 
reaches the brain about that part of the image which 
falls on this blind spot (Figure 14.18).

●● Hormones in humans

Key definition
A hormone is a chemical substance, produced by a gland and 

carried by the blood, which alters the activity of one or 
more specific target organs.

Co-ordination by the nervous system is usually 
rapid and precise. Nerve impulses, travelling at up 
to 100 metres per second, are delivered to specific 
parts of the body and produce an almost immediate 
response. A different kind of co-ordination is brought 
about by the endocrine system. This system depends 
on chemicals, called hormones, which are released 
from special glands, called endocrine glands, into 
the bloodstream. The hormones circulate around 
the body in the blood and eventually reach certain 
organs, called target organs. Hormones speed up, 
slow down or alter the activity of those organs.  
After being secreted, hormones do not remain 
permanently in the blood but are changed by the 
liver into inactive compounds and excreted by 
the kidneys. Insulin, for example, may stay in the 
bloodstream for just 4–8 hours before being broken 
down. Table 14.3 compares control by the endocrine 
and nervous systems.

Unlike the digestive glands, endocrine glands do 
not deliver their secretions through ducts (tubes). 
For this reason, the endocrine glands are sometimes 
called ‘ductless glands’. The hormones are picked up 
directly from the glands by the blood circulation.
Responses of the body to hormones are much 

slower than responses to nerve impulses. They 
depend, in the first instance, on the speed of the 
circulatory system and then on the time it takes 

190

for the cells to change their chemical activities. 
Many hormones affect long-term changes such as 
growth rate, puberty and pregnancy. Nerve impulses 
often cause a response in a very limited area of the 
body, such as an eye-blink or a finger movement. 
Hormones often affect many organ systems at once.

Serious deficiencies or excesses of hormone 

production give rise to illnesses. Small differences 
in hormone activity between individuals probably 
contribute to differences of personality and 
temperament.

the reproductive organs have a dual function.
●● Extension work
Thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is situated in the front part of the 
neck and lies in front of the windpipe. It produces 
a hormone called thyroxine. This hormone has a 
stimulatory effect on the metabolic rate of nearly 
all the body cells, such as the speed or rate of 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_14.indd   190

8/18/14   9:49 PM

cell respiration (Chapter 12) and other chemical 
reactions. It controls our level of activity, promotes 
skeletal growth and is essential for the normal 
development of the brain.
Pituitary gland
This gland is attached to the base of the brain. 
It produces many hormones. For example, 
the pituitary releases into the blood follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH) which, when it 
reaches the ovaries, makes one of the follicles start 
to mature and to produce oestrogen. Luteinising 
hormone (LH), also known as lutropin, is also 
produced from the pituitary and, together with 
FSH, induces ovulation (see ‘Sex hormones in 
humans’ in Chapter 16).

Adrenal glands
These glands are attached to the back of the 
abdominal cavity, one above each kidney (see also 
Figure 13.1). One part of the adrenal gland is a zone 
called the adrenal medulla. The medulla receives 
nerves from the brain and produces the hormone 
adrenaline.

Adrenaline has obvious effects on the body:

●  In response to a stressful situation, nerve impulses 

are sent from the brain to the adrenal medulla, 
which releases adrenaline into the blood. 

●  Its presence causes breathing to become faster and 

deeper. This may be particularly apparent as we 
pant for breath. 

●  The heart beats faster, resulting in an increase in 
pulse rate. This increase in heart rate can be quite 
alarming, making us feel as if our heart is going to 
burst out of our chest. 

●  The pupils of our eyes dilate, making them look 

much blacker. 

These effects all make us more able to react quickly 
and vigorously in dangerous situations (known as 
‘fight or flight situations’) that might require us to 
run away or put up a struggle. However, in many 
stressful situations, such as taking examinations or 
giving a public performance, vigorous activity is not 
called for. So the extra adrenaline in our bodies just 
makes us feel tense and anxious.

Hormones in humans

The pancreas
The pancreas is a digestive gland that secretes 
enzymes into the duodenum through the 
pancreatic duct (Chapter 7). It is also an endocrine 
(ductless) gland. Most of the pancreas cells 
produce digestive enzymes but some of them 
produce hormones. The hormone-producing cells 
are arranged in small isolated groups called islets 
(Figure 14.20) and secrete their hormones directly 
into the bloodstream. One of the hormones is 
called insulin.

enzyme-secreting
cells

Figure 14.20  Section of pancreas tissue showing an islet (×250)

Insulin controls the levels of glucose in the blood by 
instructing the liver to remove the sugars and store 
them. This happens when levels get too high, such as 
after a meal rich in carbohydrate. (See page 196 for 
further details of the action of insulin.)
Reproductive organs
The ovaries and testes produce hormones as well 
as gametes (sperms and ova) and their effects are 
described in Chapter 16.

One of the hormones from the ovary, oestrogen, 

prepares the uterus for the implantation of the 
embryo, by making its lining thicker and increasing 
its blood supply. 

The hormones testosterone (from the testes) 

and oestrogen (from the ovaries) play a part in the 
development of the secondary sexual characteristics.

The role of adrenaline
As adrenaline circulates around the body it affects  
a number of organs, as shown in Table 14.4.  

You will recognise the sensations described in 
column four of Table 14.4 as characteristic of fear 
and anxiety.

Adrenaline is quickly converted by the liver to a 
less active compound, which is excreted by the 
kidneys. All hormones are similarly altered and 
excreted, some within minutes, others within days. 

Thus their effects are not long-lasting. The long-
term hormones, such as thyroxine, are secreted 
continuously to maintain a steady level.

●● Homeostasis

Key definition
Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal 

environment.

Homeostasis literally means ‘staying similar’. It 
refers to the fact that the composition of the tissue 
fluid (see ‘Blood’ in Chapter 9) in the body is kept 
within narrow limits. The concentration, acidity and 
temperature of this fluid are being adjusted all the 
time to prevent any big changes.
The skin and temperature control
Skin structure
Figure 14.21 shows a section through skin. In the 
basal layer some of the cells are continually dividing 
and pushing the older cells nearer the surface. 
Here they die and are shed at the same rate as they 
are replaced. The basal layer and the cells above 
it constitute the epidermis. The basal layer also 
contributes to the hair follicles. The dividing cells 
give rise to the hair.

There are specialised pigment cells in the basal 

layer and epidermis. These produce a black pigment, 

melanin, which gives the skin its colour. The more 
melanin, the darker is the skin.

The thickness of the epidermis and the abundance 

of hairs vary in different parts of the body 
(Figure 14.22).

The dermis contains connective tissue with hair 

follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, blood vessels 
and nerve endings. There is usually a layer of adipose 
tissue (a fat deposit) beneath the dermis.

Skin function
Protection
The outermost layer of dead cells of the epidermis 
helps to reduce water loss and provides a barrier 
against bacteria. The pigment cells protect the skin 
from damage by the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. In 
white-skinned people, more melanin is produced in 
response to exposure to sunlight, giving rise to a tan.
Sensitivity
Scattered throughout the skin are large numbers of 
tiny sense receptors, which give rise to sensations of 
touch, pressure, heat, cold and pain. These make us 
aware of changes in our surroundings and enable us 
to take action to avoid damage, to recognise objects 
by touch and to manipulate objects with our hands.

Temperature regulation
The skin helps to keep the body temperature more 
or less constant. This is done by adjusting the flow of 
blood near the skin surface and by sweating. These 
processes are described more fully below.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_14.indd   193

Temperature control
Normal human body temperature varies between 
35.8 °C and 37.7 °C. Temperatures below 34 °C or 
above 40 °C, if maintained for long, are considered 
dangerous. Different body regions, e.g. the hands, 
feet, head or internal organs, will be at different 
temperatures, but the core temperature, as measured 
with a thermometer under the tongue, will vary by 
only 1 or 2 degrees.

Heat is lost from the body surface by 

conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation. 
The amount of heat lost is reduced to an extent 
due to the insulating properties of adipose (fatty) 
tissue in the dermis. Some mammals living in 
extreme conditions, such as whales and seals, make 
much greater use of this: they have thick layers of 
blubber to reduce heat loss more effectively. Just 
how much insulation the blubber gives depends 
on the amount of water in the tissue: a smaller 
proportion of water and more fat provide better 
insulating properties.

 Heat is gained, internally, from the process of 

respiration (Chapter 12) in the tissues and, externally, 
from the surroundings or from the Sun. 

193

 14  Co-ordiNatioN aNd respoNse

The two processes of heat gain and heat loss  

are normally in balance but any imbalance is 
corrected by a number of methods, including  
those described below.
Overheating
●  More blood flows near the surface of the skin, 
allowing more heat to be exchanged with the 
surroundings.

● Sweating – the sweat glands secrete sweat on 
to the skin surface. When this layer of liquid 
evaporates, it takes heat (latent heat) from the body 
and cools it down (Figure 14.23).

to heat loss or gain. You cannot consciously detect 
changes in your core temperature. The brain 
plays a direct role in detecting any changes from 
normal by monitoring the temperature of the 
blood. A region called the hypothalamus contains 
a thermoregulatory centre in which temperature 
receptors detect temperature changes in the blood 
and co-ordinate a response to them. Temperature 
receptors are also present in the skin. They send 
information to the brain about temperature 
changes.

Overcooling
●  Less blood flows near the surface of the 

skin, reducing the amount of heat lost to the 
surroundings.

●  Sweat production stops – thus the heat lost by 

evaporation is reduced.

● Shivering – uncontrollable bursts of rapid 

muscular contraction in the limbs release heat as a 
result of respiration in the muscles.

In these ways, the body temperature remains at about 
37 °C. We also control our temperature by adding or 
removing clothing or deliberately taking exercise.
Whether we feel hot or cold depends on the 

sensory nerve endings in the skin, which respond 

Figure 14.23  Sweating. During vigorous activity the sweat evaporates 
from the skin and helps to cool the body. When the activity stops, 
continued evaporation of sweat may overcool the body unless it is 
towelled off.

Homeostasis
It is vital that there are homeostatic mechanisms in the 
body to control internal conditions within set limits.
In Chapter 5 it was explained that, in living cells, 
all the chemical reactions are controlled by enzymes. 
The enzymes are very sensitive to the conditions in 
which they work. A slight fall in temperature or a rise 
in acidity may slow down or stop an enzyme from 
working and thus prevent an important reaction 
from taking place in the cell.

The cell membrane controls the substances that 

enter and leave the cell, but it is the tissue fluid 
that supplies or removes these substances, and it is 
therefore important to keep the composition of the 
tissue fluid as steady as possible. If the tissue fluid 
were to become too concentrated, it would withdraw 
water from the cells by osmosis (Chapter 3) and the 
body would be dehydrated. If the tissue fluid were 
to become too dilute, the cells would take up too 

much water from it by osmosis and the tissues would 
become waterlogged and swollen.

Many systems in the body contribute to 

homeostasis (Figure 14.24). The obvious example 
is the kidneys, which remove substances that might 
poison the enzymes. The kidneys also control the 
level of salts, water and acids in the blood. The 
composition of the blood affects the tissue fluid 
which, in turn, affects the cells.

Another example of a homeostatic organ is 

the liver, which regulates the level of glucose in 
the blood. The liver stores any excess glucose as 
glycogen, or turns glycogen back into glucose if the 
concentration in the blood gets too low. The brain 
cells are very sensitive to the glucose concentration 
in the blood and if the level drops too far, they 
stop working properly, and the person becomes 
unconscious and will die unless glucose is injected 
into the blood system. This shows how important 
homeostasis is to the body.

Figure 14.24  The homeostatic mechanisms of the body

The lungs (Chapter 11) play a part in homeostasis 
by keeping the concentrations of oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in the blood at the best level for the cells’ 
chemical reactions, especially respiration.

The skin regulates the temperature of the blood. 

If the cells were to get too cold, the chemical 
reactions would become too slow to maintain life. 
If they became too hot, the enzymes would be 
destroyed. 

The brain has overall control of the homeostatic 
processes in the body. It checks the composition of 
the blood flowing through it and if it is too warm, 
too cold, too concentrated or has too little glucose, 
nerve impulses or hormones are sent to the organs 
concerned, causing them to make the necessary 
adjustments.

Homeostasis and negative 
feedback
Temperature regulation is an example of homeostasis. 
Maintenance of a constant body temperature 
ensures that vital chemical reactions continue at 
a predictable rate and do not speed up or slow 
down when the surrounding temperature changes. 
The constant-temperature or homoiothermic 
(‘warm-blooded’) animals, the birds and mammals, 
therefore have an advantage over the variable-

temperature or poikilothermic (‘cold-blooded’) 
animals. Poikilotherms such as reptiles and insects 
can regulate their body temperature to some extent 
by, for example, basking in the sun or seeking 
shade. Nevertheless, if their body temperature 
falls, their vital chemistry slows down and their 
reactions become more sluggish. They are then more 
vulnerable to predators.

The ‘price’ that homoiotherms have to pay 
is the intake of enough food to maintain their 
body temperature, usually above that of their 
surroundings.

In the hypothalamus of a homoiotherm’s 

brain there is a thermoregulatory centre. This 
centre monitors the temperature of the blood 
passing through it and also receives sensory 
nerve impulses from temperature receptors in the 
skin. A rise in body temperature is detected by 
the thermoregulatory centre and it sends nerve 
impulses to the skin, which result in vasodilation and 
sweating. Similarly, a fall in body temperature will 
be detected and will promote impulses that produce 
vasoconstriction and shivering.

This system of control is called negative 

feedback. The outgoing impulses counteract the 
effects that produced the incoming impulses. For 
example, a rise in temperature triggers responses 
that counteract the rise.

 Regulation of blood sugar
If the level of sugar in the blood falls, the islets 
release a hormone called glucagon into the 
bloodstream. Glucagon acts on the cells in the liver 
and causes them to convert some of their stored 
glycogen into glucose and so restore the blood  
sugar level.

Insulin has the opposite effect to glucagon. If the 
concentration of blood sugar increases (e.g. after a 
meal rich in carbohydrate), insulin is released from 
the islet cells. When the insulin reaches the liver it 
stimulates the liver cells to take up glucose from the 
blood and store it as glycogen. 

Insulin has many other effects; it increases the 

uptake of glucose in all cells for use in respiration;  
it promotes the conversion of carbohydrates to  
fats and slows down the conversion of protein  
to carbohydrate.

All these changes have the effect of regulating  
the level of glucose in the blood to within narrow 
limits – a very important example of homeostasis.

levels too high

insulin

glycogen

The concentration of glucose in the blood of a 
person who has not eaten for 8 hours is usually 
between 90 and 100 mg 100 cm−3 blood. After a 
meal containing carbohydrate, the blood sugar 
level may rise to 140 mg 100 cm−3 but 2 hours later, 
the level returns to about 95 mg as the liver has 
converted the excess glucose to glycogen.

About 100 g glycogen is stored in the liver of 

a healthy man. If the concentration of glucose 
in the blood falls below about 80 mg 100 cm−3 
blood, some of the glycogen stored in the liver is 
converted by enzyme action into glucose, which 
enters the circulation. If the blood sugar level rises 
above 160 mg 100 cm−3, glucose is excreted by  
the kidneys.

A blood glucose level below 40 mg 100 cm−3 

affects the brain cells adversely, leading to 
convulsions and coma. By helping to keep the 
glucose concentration between 80 and 150 mg, 

the liver prevents these undesirable effects and so 
contributes to the homeostasis of the body. 

If anything goes wrong with the production 
or function of insulin, the person will show the 
symptoms of diabetes.

 Type 1 diabetes
There are two types of diabetes and type 1 is the less 
common form, the cause of which has been outlined 
in Chapter 10. It results from a failure of the islet 
cells to produce sufficient insulin. The outcome is 
that the patient’s blood is deficient in insulin and 
he or she needs regular injections of the hormone 
in order to control blood sugar level and so lead a 
normal life. This form of the disease is, therefore, 
sometimes called ‘insulin-dependent’ diabetes. The 
patient is unable to regulate the level of glucose in 
the blood. It may rise to such a high level that it is 
excreted in the urine, or fall so low that the brain 
cells cannot work properly and the person goes into 
a coma. 

The symptoms of type 1 diabetes include feeling 

tired, feeling very thirsty, frequent urination and 
weight loss. Weight loss is experienced because the 
body starts to break down muscle and fat.

Diabetics need a carefully regulated diet to keep 

the blood sugar within reasonable limits. They 
should have regular blood tests to monitor their 
blood sugar levels and take regular exercise.

 Temperature control
In addition to the methods already described, the 
skin has another very important mechanism for 
maintaining a constant body temperature. This 
involves arterioles in the dermis of the skin, which 
can widen or narrow to allow more or less blood 
to flow near the skin surface through the blood 
capillaries. Further details of this process, involving 
the use of shunt vessels, are given in Chapter 9.

Vasodilation – the widening of the arterioles in 

the dermis allows more warm blood to flow through 
blood capillaries near the skin surface and so lose 
more heat (Figure 14.25(a)).

Vasoconstriction – narrowing (constriction) of 

the arterioles in the skin reduces the amount of 
warm blood flowing through blood capillaries near 
the surface (Figure 14.25(b)).

●● Tropic responses
Sensitivity is the ability of living organisms to respond 
to stimuli. Although plants do not respond by 
moving their whole bodies, parts of them do respond 
to stimuli. Some of these responses are described as 
tropic responses or tropisms.
Tropisms
Tropisms are growth movements related to 
directional stimuli, e.g. a shoot will grow towards 
a source of light but away from the direction of 
gravity. Growth movements of this kind are usually in 
response to the direction of light or gravity. Responses 
to light are called phototropisms; responses to 
gravity are gravitropisms (or geotropisms).

Key definitions
Gravitropism is a response in which a plant grows towards or 

away from gravity.

Phototropism is a response in which a plant grows towards or 

away from the direction from which light is coming.

If the plant organ responds by growing towards the 
stimulus, the response is said to be ‘positive’. If the 
response is growth away from the stimulus it is said 

Figure 14.26  Negative gravitropism. The tomato plant has been left on 
its side for 24 hours.

The shoot is negatively gravitropic. The roots, 
however, will change their direction of growth to 
grow vertically downwards towards the pull of gravity 
(Experiment 1). Roots, therefore, are positively 
gravitropic.

Phototropism and gravitropism are best illustrated 
by some simple controlled experiments. Seedlings are 
good material for experiments on sensitivity because 
their growing roots (radicles) and shoots respond 
readily to the stimuli of light and gravity.

Practical work

Experiments on tropisms

1  Gravitropism in pea radicles

n  Soak about 20 peas in water for a day and then let them 

germinate in a vertical roll of moist blotting-paper. 

n  After 3 days, choose 12 seedlings with straight radicles and pin 

six of these to the turntable of a clinostat so that the radicles 
are horizontal. 

n  Pin another six seedlings to a cork that will fit in a wide-

mouthed jar. Leave the jar on its side. 

n  A clinostat is a clockwork or electric turntable, which rotates 

the seedlings slowly about four times an hour. Although 
gravity is pulling sideways on their roots, it will pull equally on 
all sides as they rotate.

n  Place the jar and the clinostat in the same conditions of 

lighting or leave them in darkness for 2 days.

Result
The radicles in the clinostat will continue to grow horizontally but 
those in the jar will have changed their direction of growth, to 
grow vertically downwards (Figure 14.27).

Figure 14.27  Results of an experiment to show gravitropism in roots

Interpretation
The stationary radicles have responded to the stimulus of one-
sided gravity by growing towards it. The radicles are positively 
gravitropic.

The radicles in the clinostat are the controls. Rotation of the 

clinostat has allowed gravity to act on all sides equally and 
there is no one-sided stimulus, even though the radicles were 
horizontal.

2  Phototropism in shoots
n  Select two potted seedlings, e.g. sunflower or runner bean, of 

similar size and water them both. 

n  Place one of them under a cardboard box with a window cut 
in one side so that light reaches the shoot from one direction 
only (Figure 14.28). 

n  Place the other plant in an identical situation but on a 

clinostat. This will rotate the plant about four times per hour 
and expose each side of the shoot equally to the source of 
light. This is the control.

Result
After 1 or 2 days, the two plants are removed from the boxes 
and compared. It will be found that the stem of the plant with 
one-sided illumination has changed its direction of growth and is 
growing towards the light (Figure 14.29). The control shoot has 
continued to grow vertically.

198

Figure 14.29  Positive phototropism. The sunflower seedlings have 
received one-sided lighting for a day.

Interpretation
The results suggest that the young shoot has responded to one-
sided lighting by growing towards the light. The shoot is said to 
be positively phototropic because it grows towards the direction 
of the stimulus.

However, the results of an experiment with a single plant 

cannot be used to draw conclusions that apply to green plants as 
a whole. The experiment described here is more of an illustration 
than a critical investigation. To investigate phototropisms 
thoroughly, a large number of plants from a wide variety of 
species would have to be used. 

Advantages of tropic responses
Positive phototropism of shoots
By growing towards the source of light, a shoot brings 
its leaves into the best situation for photosynthesis. 
Similarly, the flowers are brought into an exposed 
position where they are most likely to be seen and 
pollinated by flying insects.
Negative gravitropism in shoots
Shoots that are negatively gravitropic grow vertically. 
This lifts the leaves and flowers above the ground 
and helps the plant to compete for light and 
carbon dioxide. The flowers are brought into an 
advantageous position for insect or wind pollination. 
Seed dispersal may be more effective from fruits on 
a long, vertical stem. However, these advantages 
are a product of a tall shoot rather than negative 
gravitropism.

Stems that form rhizomes (stems that grow 

underground) are not negatively gravitropic; they grow 
horizontally below the ground, though the shoots that 
grow up from them are negatively gravitropic.

Branches from upright stems are not negatively 

gravitropic; they grow at 90 degrees or, usually, at a 
more acute angle to the directional pull of gravity. 
The lower branches of a potato plant must be 
partially positively gravitropic when they grow down 
into the soil and produce potato tubers (see ‘Asexual 
reproduction’ in Chapter 16).
Positive gravitropism in roots
By growing towards gravity, roots penetrate the 
soil, which is their means of anchorage and their 
source of water and mineral salts. Lateral roots 
are not positively gravitropic; they grow at right 
angles or slightly downwards from the main root. 
This response enables a large volume of soil to be 
exploited and helps to anchor the plants securely.

Practical work

3  Region of response
n  Grow pea seedlings in a vertical roll of blotting paper and 

select four with straight radicles about 25 mm long. 

n  Mark all the radicles with lines about 1 mm apart 

(Figures 14.30 and 14.31(a)). 

n  Use four strips of moist cotton wool to wedge two seedlings in 

each of two Petri dishes (Figure 14.31). 

n  Leave the dishes on their sides for 2 days, one (A) with the 

radicles vertical and the other (B) with the radicles horizontal.

 Control of growth
In animals and plants, the growth rate and extent of 
growth are controlled by chemicals: hormones in 
animals and growth substances in plants. Additionally, 
growth may be limited in animals by the availability of 
food, and in plants by light, water and minerals.

There are many different growth substances (‘plant 

hormones’) in plants. They are similar in some ways 
to animal hormones because they are produced

Interpretation
The response to the stimulus of one-sided gravity takes place in 
the region of extension. It does not necessarily mean that this is 
also the region which detects the stimulus.

in specific regions of the plant and transported 
to ‘target’ organs such as roots, shoots and buds. 
However, the sites of production are not specialised 
organs, as in animals, but regions of actively dividing 
cells such as the tips of shoots and roots. Also, plant 
growth substances are not transported in vessels.

One of the growth substances is auxin. 

Chemically it is indoleacetic acid (IAA). It is 
produced in the tips of actively growing roots and 
shoots and carried by active transport (Chapter 3) 
to the regions of extension where it promotes cell 
enlargement (Figure 14.32).

The responses made by shoots and roots to light and 
gravity are influenced by growth substances.

Growth substances also control seed germination, 

bud burst, leaf fall, initiation of lateral roots and 
many other processes.

It has already been explained that growth 

substances, e.g. auxin, are produced by the tips of 
roots and shoots and can stimulate or, in some cases, 
inhibit extension growth. Tropic responses could 
be explained if the one-sided stimuli produced a 
corresponding one-sided distribution of growth 
substance.

In the case of positive gravitropism in roots 

there is evidence that, in a horizontal root, more 
growth substance accumulates on the lower side. 
In this case the growth substance is presumed to 
inhibit extension growth, so that the root tip curves 
downwards (Figure 14.33).

In the case of phototropism, it is generally accepted 

that the distribution of growth substance causes 
reduced extension on the illuminated side and/or 
increased extension on the non-illuminated side.

 Summary of control of shoot growth by auxin 
When a shoot is exposed to light from one side, 
auxins that have been produced by the tip move 
towards the shaded side of the shoot (or the auxins 
are destroyed on the light side, causing an unequal 

200

distribution). Cells on the shaded side are stimulated 
to absorb more water than those on the light side, so 
the unequal growth causes the stem to bend towards 
the light. Growth of a shoot towards light is called 
positive phototropism.

If a shoot is placed horizontally in the absence 

of light, auxins accumulate on the lower side of the 
shoot, due to gravity. This makes the cells on the 
lower side grow faster than those on the upper side, 
so the shoot bends upwards. This is called negative 
gravitropism.

The opposite applies to roots because root cell 

elongation appears to be slowed down by exposure 
to auxin.

 Classic experiments to test how auxins work
Wheat and other grass species belong to the 
monocotyledon group of flowering plants 
(Chapter 1). When wheat seeds germinate (start 
to grow) they produce a shoot covered by a 
protective sheath called a coleoptile. This helps 
to prevent damage to the new leaves as they push 
through the soil. The coleoptile shows responses 
to light and gravity in a similar way to other plant 
parts. Wheat coleoptiles only take 2 or 3 days to 
grow and they show responses very quickly, so 
they are ideal for tropism experiments. The tip 
of the coleoptile, where it is expected that auxins 
would be produced, can be cut off without killing 
the plant, but effectively removing the source of 
the auxin. Figure 14.34 shows an investigation, 
treating coleoptiles in different ways.

Results
A No growth of the coleoptile occurs and there is  

no bending.

B The coleoptile grows taller and bends towards  

the light.

C The coleoptile grows taller, but there is no bending.
D The coleoptile grows taller and bends towards  

the light.

Interpretation 
In A, the source of auxin has been removed. Auxin 
is needed to stimulate growth and stimulates a 
response to light. It could also be argued that the tip 
provides cells for growth and this source of cells has 
been removed.

In B, auxin is produced by the tip of the coleoptile. It 
diffuses down the coleoptile and collects on the shaded 
side of the coleoptile (or is destroyed by the light on 
the light side). Cells on the shaded side respond to the 
auxin by growing faster than on the light side causing 
the coleoptile to grow towards the light. 

In C, auxin is produced by the tip and diffuses 

down, causing all cells on both sides of the coleoptile 
to grow at an equal rate, causing an increase in 
length. However, the black paper prevents the light 
influencing the auxin, so there is no response to the 
direction of light.

In D, auxin is produced by the tip of the coleoptile. 

It diffuses into the agar block. When the agar block 
is replaced on the cut coleoptile, the auxin diffuses 
down from the agar and collects on the shaded side 
of the coleoptile (or is destroyed by the light on the 
light side). Cells on the shaded side respond to the 
auxin by growing faster than on the light side causing 
the coleoptile to grow towards the light.

 Use of plant growth substances
Chemicals can be manufactured which closely 
resemble natural growth substances and may be 
used to control various aspects of growth and 
development of crop plants.

The weedkiller, 2,4-D, is very similar to one of 
the auxins. When sprayed on a lawn, it affects the 
broad-leaved weeds (e.g. daisies and dandelions) but 
not the grasses. (It is called a ‘selective weedkiller’.) 
Among other effects, it distorts the weeds’ growth 
and speeds up their rate of respiration to the extent 
that they exhaust their food reserves and die.

Checklist 
After studying Chapter 14 you should know and understand the 
following:

The nervous system
•  The central nervous system consists of the brain and the 

spinal cord.

•  The peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves.
•  The nerves consist of bundles of nerve fibres.
•  Each nerve fibre is a thin filament that grows out of a nerve 

cell body.

•  The nerve cell bodies are mostly in the brain and spinal cord.
•  Nerve fibres carry electrical impulses from sense organs to the 

brain or from the brain to muscles and glands.

•  A reflex is an automatic nervous reaction that cannot be 

consciously controlled.

•  A reflex arc is the nervous pathway that carries the impulses 

causing a reflex action.

•  The simplest reflex involves a sensory nerve cell and a motor 

nerve cell, connected by synapses in the spinal cord.

•  The brain and spinal cord contain millions of nerve cells.
•  The millions of possible connections between the nerve cells 
in the brain allow complicated actions, learning, memory and 
intelligence.

•  Voluntary actions start in the brain, while involuntary

of a minute gap across which impulses pass by diffusion 
of a neurotransmitter.

•  Identify parts of a synapse and describe how it transmits 

an impulse from one neurone to another.

•  Drugs such as morphine and heroin can affect synapses.
•  In reflex arcs, synapses ensure the movement of impulses

Hormones in humans
•  A hormone is a chemical substance, produced by a gland, 

carried by the blood, which alters the activity of one or more 
specific target organs

tropic responses

•  The endocrine glands release hormones into the blood 

system.

•  When the hormones reach certain organs they change the 

rate or kind of activity of the organ.

•  Too much or too little of a hormone can cause a metabolic 

disorder.

•  Adrenalin is secreted in ‘fight or flight’ situations.
•  It causes an increased breathing and pulse rate and widened 

pupils.

•  Adrenaline has a role in the chemical control of 

metabolic activity, including increasing the blood glucose 
concentration and pulse rate.

•  The nervous system is much faster and its action tends to 

be over a shorter time span than hormonal control systems.

Homeostasis
•  Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal 

environment.

•  Skin consists of an outer layer of epidermis and an inner 

dermis.

•  The epidermis is growing all the time and has an outer layer 

of dead cells.

•  The dermis contains the sweat glands, hair follicles, sense 

organs and capillaries.

•  Skin (1) protects the body from bacteria and drying out, 

(2) contains sense organs which give us the sense of 
touch, warmth, cold and pain, and (3) controls the body 
temperature.

•  Chemical activity in the body and muscular contractions 

produce heat.

•  Heat is lost to the surroundings by conduction, convection, 

radiation and evaporation.

•  If the body temperature rises too much, the skin cools it 

down by sweating and vasodilation.

•  If the body loses too much heat, vasoconstriction and 

shivering help to keep it warm.

•  Negative feedback provides a means of control: if levels of 

substances in the body change, the change is monitored 
and a response to adjust levels to normal is brought 
about.

•  Glucose concentration in the blood is controlled using 

insulin and glucagon.

•  Type 1 diabetes is the result of islet cells in the pancreas 

failing to produce enough insulin.

•  Vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles in the skin 

are mechanisms to control body temperature.

Tropic responses
•  A response related to the direction of the stimulus is a 

tropism.

•  The roots and shoots of plants may respond to the stimuli of 

light or gravity.

•  Gravitropism is a response in which a plant grows towards or 

away from gravity.

•  The testes, ovaries and pancreas are also endocrine glands in

●● Drugs

Key deﬁ nition
A drug is any substance taken into the body that modifi es or 

affects chemical reactions in the body.

The drug may be one taken legally to reduce a 
symptom such as a headache or to treat a bacterial 
infection (medicinal drugs), but it could also be one 
taken – often illegally – to provide stimulation or 
induce sleep or create hallucinations (recreational 
drugs). Drugs are present in many products such as: 
tea, coffee and ‘energy drinks’ (caffeine); tobacco 
(nicotine); and alcoholic drinks (alcohol) which, 
although legal, can cause serious effects when taken 
excessively or over extended periods of time. 

●● Medicinal drugs
Any substance used in medicine to help our bodies 
fi ght illness or disease is called a drug. 

Antibiotics
The ideal drug for curing disease would be a chemical 
that destroyed the pathogen without harming the 
tissues of the host. In practice, modern antibiotics 
such as penicillin come pretty close to this ideal for 
bacterial infections. 

A tiny minority of bacteria are harmful (pathogenic). 

Figure 10.1 shows some examples and the diseases 
they cause.

Most of the antibiotics we use come from bacteria or 
fungi that live in the soil. The function of the antibiotics 
in this situation is not clear. One theory suggests that the 
chemicals help to suppress competition for limited food 
resources, but the evidence does not support this theory.

One of the most prolifi c sources of antibiotics is 
Actinomycetes. These are fi lamentous bacteria that 
resemble microscopic mould fungi. The actinomycete 
Streptomyces produces the antibiotic streptomycin.

Use of performance-enhancing drugs

Perhaps the best known antibiotic is penicillin, which 

is produced by the mould fungus Penicillium and was 
discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928. Penicillin 
is still an important antibiotic but it is produced by 
mutant forms of a different species of Penicillium from 
that studied by Fleming. The different mutant forms of 
the fungus produce different types of penicillin. 
The penicillin types are chemically altered in 
the laboratory to make them more effective and 
to ‘tailor’ them for use with different diseases. 
‘Ampicillin’, ‘methicillin’ and ‘oxacillin’ are examples.

Antibiotics attack bacteria in a variety of ways. 

Some of them disrupt the production of the cell wall 
and so prevent the bacteria from reproducing, or 
even cause them to burst open; some interfere with 
protein synthesis and thus arrest bacterial growth.

Animal cells do not have cell walls, and the 

cell structures involved in protein production are 
different. Consequently, antibiotics do not damage 
human cells although they may produce some side-
effects such as allergic reactions.

Not all bacteria are killed by antibiotics. Some 

bacteria have a nasty habit of mutating to forms that 
are resistant to these drugs. 

For this reason it is important not to use antibiotics 

in a diluted form, for too short a period or for trivial 
complaints. These practices lead to a build-up of a 
resistant population of bacteria. The drug resistance 
can be passed from harmless bacteria to pathogens.

It is important to note that antibiotics are 
ineffective in the treatment of viral diseases.
Development of resistant bacteria
If a course of antibiotics is not completed, some 
of the bacteria it is being used to destroy will 
not be killed, but will have been exposed to the 
drug. Some of the survivors may be drug-resistant 
mutants. When they reproduce, all their offspring 
will have the drug resistance, so the antibiotic will 
become less effective (Figure 15.1).

One type of bacteria that has developed resistance 
to a number of widely used antibiotics is called 
MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). 
These types of bacteria are sometime referred 
to as ‘superbugs’ because they are so difficult to 
treat. Staphylococcus aureus is very common and 
is found living harmlessly on the skin, the nose 
and throat, sometimes causing mild infections. It 
becomes dangerous if there is a break in the skin, 
allowing it to infect internal organs and causing 
blood poisoning. This can happen in hospitals with 
infection during operations, especially if hygiene 
precautions are not adequate. 

Doctors now have to be much more cautious 

about prescribing antibiotics, to reduce the risk of 

resistant strains developing. Patients need to be 
aware of the importance of completing a course of 
antibiotics, again to reduce the risk of development 
of resistant strains.

Antibiotics and viral diseases
Antibiotics are not effective against viral diseases. 
This is because antibiotics work by disrupting 
structures in bacteria such as cell walls and 
membranes, or processes associated with protein 
synthesis and replication of DNA. Viruses have totally 
different characteristics to bacteria, so antibiotics do 
not affect them. Compare the image of a virus in 
Figure 1.34 with that of a bacterium in Figure 1.29.

●● Extension work
Ideas about antibiotics

Alexander Fleming (1881–1955)
Before 1934 there were few effective drugs. Some 
herbal preparations may have been useful; after all, 

206

many of our present-day drugs are derived from or 
based on plant products. Quinine, for example, was 
used for the treatment of malaria and was extracted 
from a specific kind of tree bark.

In 1935, a group of chemicals called 

sulfanilamides were found to be effective against 
some bacterial diseases such as blood poisoning, 
pneumonia and septic wounds.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_15.indd   206

8/18/14   9:50 PM

Misused drugs

Fleming had discovered penicillin in 1928, 7 years 

before the use of sulfanilamides, but he had been 
unable to purify it and test it on humans. Fleming 
was a bacteriologist working at St Mary’s Hospital 
in London. In 1928, he was studying different 
strains of Staphylococcus bacteria. He had made 
some cultures on agar plates and left them on the 
laboratory bench during a 4-week holiday. When he 
returned he noticed that one of the plates had been 
contaminated by a mould fungus and that around 
the margins of the mould there was a clear zone with 
no bacteria growing (Figure 15.2).

Figure 15.2  Appearance of the Staphylococcus colonies on Fleming’s 
petri dish 

Fleming reasoned that a substance had diffused out 
of the mould colony and killed the bacteria. The 
mould was identified as Penicillium notatum and  
the supposed anti-bacterial chemical was called 
penicillin. Fleming went on to culture the 
Penicillium on a liquid meat broth medium  
and showed that the broth contained penicillin, 
which suppressed the growth of a wide range  
of bacteria. 

Two research assistants at St Mary’s then tried 
to obtain a pure sample of penicillin, free from all 
the other substances in the broth. Although they 
succeeded, the procedure was cumbersome and the 
product was unstable. By this time, Fleming seemed 
to have lost interest and to assume that penicillin 
would be too difficult to extract and too unstable to 
be of medical value.

In 1939, Howard Florey (a pathologist) and 
Ernst Chain (a biochemist), working at Oxford 
University, succeeded in preparing reasonably 
pure penicillin and making it stable. Techniques of 
extraction had improved dramatically in 10 years and, 
in particular, freeze-drying enabled a stable water-
soluble powder form of penicillin to be produced.

World War II was an urgent incentive for the 

production of penicillin in large quantities and this 
undoubtedly saved many lives that would otherwise 
have been lost as a result of infected wounds.

Once Ernst Chain had worked out the molecular 

structure of penicillin, it became possible to modify it 
chemically and produce other forms of penicillin that 
attacked a different range of bacteria or had different 
properties. For example, ampicillin is a modified penicillin 
that can be taken by mouth rather than by injection.
Because penicillin was the product of a mould, 
chemists searched for other moulds, particularly 
those present in the soil, which might produce 
antibiotics. A large number of these were discovered, 
including streptomycin (for tuberculosis), 
chloramphenicol (for typhoid), aureomycin and 
terramycin (broad spectrum antibiotics, which attack 
a wide range of bacteria). The ideal drug is one that 
kills or suppresses the growth of harmful cells, such 
as bacteria or cancer cells, without damaging the 
body cells. Scientists have been trying for years to 
find a ‘magic bullet’ that ‘homes in’ exclusively on its 
target cells. For bacterial diseases, antibiotics come 
pretty close to the ideal, though the bacteria do seem 
able to develop resistant forms after a few years.

●● Misused drugs
Narcotics
Heroin, morphine and codeine belong to a group of 
drugs called narcotics, made from opium. Heroin 
and morphine act as powerful depressants: they 
relieve severe pain and produce short-lived feelings of 

wellbeing and freedom from anxiety. They can both 
lead to tolerance and physical dependence within 
weeks, so they are prescribed with caution, to patients 
in severe pain.

The illegal use of heroin has terrible effects on the 
unfortunate addict. The overwhelming dependence 
on the drug leads many addicts into prostitution  
and crime in order to obtain the money to buy it.

 15  Drugs

There are severe withdrawal symptoms when an 
addict tries to give up the drug abruptly. These 
symptoms are called going ‘cold turkey’ and can 
include anxiety, muscle aches, sweating, abdominal 
cramping, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. A ‘cure’ is 
a long and often unsuccessful process.

Additional hazards are that blood poisoning, 
hepatitis and AIDS may result from the use of 
unsterilised needles when injecting the drug.

Codeine is a less effective analgesic than morphine, 

but does not lead so easily to dependence. It is still 
addictive if used in large enough doses.
Alcohol
The alcohol in wines, beer and spirits is a depressant 
of the central nervous system. Small amounts give 
a sense of wellbeing, with a release from anxiety. 
However, this is accompanied by a fall-off in 
performance in any activity requiring skill. It also gives 
a misleading sense of confidence in spite of the fact 
that one’s judgement is clouded. A drunken driver 
usually thinks he or she is driving extremely well.

Even a small amount of alcohol in the blood increases 

our reaction time (the interval between receiving a 
stimulus and making a response). In some people, the 
reaction time is doubled even when the alcohol in the 
blood is well below the legal limit laid down for car 
drivers (Figure 15.3). This can make a big difference 
to the time needed for a driver to apply the brakes after 
seeing a hazard such as a child running into the road.

208

Alcohol causes vasodilation in the skin, giving a 
sensation of warmth but in fact leading to a greater 
loss of body heat (see ‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14). 
A concentration of 500 mg of alcohol in 100 cm3 of 
blood results in unconsciousness. More than this will 
cause death because it stops the breathing centre in 
the brain. The liver treats alcohol as a toxin: 90% of 
alcohol taken in is detoxified in the liver (along with 
other toxins). The process of detoxification involves 
the oxidation of alcohol to carbon dioxide and water. 
Only 10% is excreted by the kidneys. On average, 
the liver can oxidise about 75 mg alcohol per 1 kg 
body weight per hour. This rate varies considerably 
from one individual to the next but it indicates that 
it would take about 3 hours to oxidise the alcohol in 
a pint of beer or a glass of wine. If the alcohol intake 
exceeds this rate of oxidation, the level of alcohol in 
the blood builds up to toxic proportions; that is, it 
leads to intoxication.

Some people build up a tolerance to alcohol 

and this may lead to both emotional and physical 
dependence (alcoholism). High doses of alcohol can 
cause the liver cells to form too many fat droplets, 
leading to the disease called cirrhosis. A cirrhotic 
liver is less able to stop poisonous substances in 
the intestinal blood from reaching the general 
circulation.

Pregnancy
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can present a 
major risk to the developing fetus. Further details are 
given in Chapter 16.

Behaviour
Alcohol reduces inhibitions because it depresses that 
part of the brain which causes shyness. This may 
be considered an advantage in ‘breaking the ice’ at 
parties. But it can also lead to irresponsible behaviour 
such as vandalism and aggression.

Moderate drinking
A moderate intake of alcoholic drink seems to do 
little physiological harm (except in pregnant women). 
But what is a ‘moderate’ intake?

A variety of drinks that all contain the same 

amount of alcohol is shown in Figure 15.4. Beer 
is a fairly dilute form of alcohol. Whisky, however, 
is about 40% alcohol. Even so, half a pint of beer 
contains the same amount of alcohol as a single 
whisky. This amount of alcohol can be called a ‘unit’. 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_15.indd   208

8/18/14   9:50 PM

It is the number of units of alcohol, not the type 
of drink, which has a physiological effect on the 
body. In Britain, the Health Development Agency 
recommends upper limits of 21–28 units for men and 
14–21 units for women over a 1-week period at the 
time of publication of this book. Pregnant women 
should avoid alcohol altogether.

same amount of alcohol (1 unit). Although the alcohol is more dilute in 
the beer than in the whisky, it has the same effect on the body.

Smoking
The short-term effects of smoking cause the 
bronchioles to constrict and the cilia lining the air 
passages to stop beating. The smoke also makes 
the lining produce more mucus. Nicotine, the 
addictive component of tobacco smoke, produces 
an increase in the rate of the heartbeat and a rise 
in blood pressure. It may, in some cases, cause an 
erratic and irregular heart beat. Tar in cigarette 
smoke is thought to be the main cause of lung cancer 
in smokers. Carbon monoxide permanently binds 
with haemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing the 
smoker’s ability to provide oxygen to respiring cells. 
This results in a smoker getting out of breath more 
easily and it reduces physical fitness.

The long-term effects of smoking may take many 

years to develop but they are severe, disabling and 
often lethal.

Lung cancer
Cancer is a term used for diseases in which cells 
become abnormal and divide out-of-control. They 
can then move around the body and invade other 
tissues. A chemical that causes cancer is known as a 
carcinogen. Carcinogens present in cigarette smoke, 
such as tar, increase the risk of lung cells becoming 
cancerous. Tumours develop. These are balls of 
abnormal cells, which do not allow gaseous exchange 
like normal lung cells. 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_15.indd   209

Misused drugs

Many studies have now demonstrated how 

cigarette smoke damages lung cells, confirming  
that smoking does cause cancer. The higher the 
number of cigarettes smoked, the greater the risk  
of lung cancer. 

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)
This term covers a number of lung diseases, which 
include chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic 
obstructive airways disease. A person suffering  
from COPD will experience difficulties with 
breathing, mainly because of narrowing of the 
airways (bronchi and bronchioles). Symptoms of 
COPD include breathlessness when active, frequent 
chest infections and a persistent cough with phlegm 
(sticky mucus).

Emphysema
Emphysema is a breakdown of the alveoli. The 
action of one or more of the substances in tobacco 
smoke weakens the walls of the alveoli. The irritant 
substances in the smoke cause a ‘smokers’ cough’  
and the coughing bursts some of the weakened 
alveoli. In time, the absorbing surface of the lungs 
is greatly reduced (Figure 15.5). Then the smoker 
cannot oxygenate his or her blood properly and 
the least exertion makes the person breathless and 
exhausted.

Chronic bronchitis
The smoke stops the cilia in the air passages from 
beating, so the irritant substances in the smoke and 
the excess mucus collect in the bronchi. This leads 
to inflammation known as bronchitis. Over 95% of 
people suffering from bronchitis are smokers and 
they have a 20 times greater chance of dying from 
bronchitis than non-smokers.

Heart disease
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause  
of death in most developed countries. It results  
from a blockage of coronary arteries by fatty 
deposits. This reduces the supply of oxygenated 
blood to the heart muscle and sooner or later 
leads to heart failure (see Chapter 9). High blood 
pressure, diets with too much animal fat and lack 
of exercise are also thought to be causes of heart 
attack, but about a quarter of all deaths due to 
coronary heart disease are thought to be caused  
by smoking (see Figure 9.12).

Figure 15.5  Emphysema

The nicotine and carbon monoxide from cigarette 
smoke increase the tendency for the blood to clot and 
so block the coronary arteries, already partly blocked 
by fatty deposits. The carbon monoxide increases  
the rate at which the fatty material is deposited in  
the arteries.

Other risks
About 95% of patients with disease of the leg arteries 
are cigarette smokers; this condition is the most 
frequent cause of leg amputations.

Strokes due to arterial disease in the brain are more 

frequent in smokers.

Cancer of the bladder, ulcers in the stomach and 

duodenum, tooth decay, gum disease and tuberculosis 
all occur more frequently in smokers.

Babies born to women who smoke during 

pregnancy are smaller than average, probably as a 
result of reduced oxygen supply caused by the carbon 
monoxide in the blood. In smokers, there is twice the 
frequency of miscarriages, a 50% higher still-birth rate 
and a 26% higher death rate of babies.

A recent estimate is that one in every three smokers 
will die as a result of their smoking habits. Those who 
do not die at an early age will probably be seriously 
disabled by one of the conditions described above.

Passive smoking
It is not only the smokers themselves who are 
harmed by tobacco smoke. Non-smokers in the same 
room are also affected. One study has shown that 
children whose parents both smoke breathe in as 
much nicotine as if they were themselves smoking 
80 cigarettes a year.

Statistical studies also suggest that the non-smoking 

wives of smokers have an increased chance of  
lung cancer.

Reducing the risks
By giving up smoking, a person who smokes up 
to 20 cigarettes a day will, after 10 years, be at no 
greater risk than a non-smoker of the same age. 
A pipe or cigar smoker, provided he or she does not 
inhale, is at less risk than a cigarette smoker but still 
at greater risk than a non-smoker.

How heroin affects the nervous 
system
As described in Chapter 14, heroin produces its 
effects by interacting with receptor molecules at 
synapses. Synapses are tiny gaps between neurones, 
across which electrical impulses cannot jump. To 
maintain the transmission of the impulse, a chemical 

messenger called a neurotransmitter is released into 
the gap. When it reaches the neurone on the other 
side, receptor molecules are stimulated to generate 
and release new electrical impulses. Heroin mimics 
the transmitter substances in synapses in the brain, 
causing the stimulation of receptor molecules. This 
causes the release of dopamine (a neurotransmitter), 
which gives a short-lived ‘high’.

Evidence for a link between 
smoking and lung cancer
Although all forms of air pollution are likely to 
increase the chances of lung cancer, many scientific 
studies show, beyond all reasonable doubt, that 
the vast increase in lung cancer (4000% in the last 
century) is almost entirely due to cigarette smoking 
(Figure 15.6).

There are at least 17 substances in tobacco smoke 
known to cause cancer in experimental animals, and 
it is now thought that 90% of lung cancer is caused 
by smoking. Table 15.1 shows the relationship 
between smoking cigarettes and the risk of 
developing lung cancer.

Correlations and causes
In Chapter 9 it was explained that a correlation 
between two variables does not prove that one 
of the variables causes the other. The fact that a 

Misused drugs

higher risk of dying from lung cancer is correlated 
with heavy smoking does not actually prove 
that smoking is the cause of lung cancer. The 
alternative explanation is that people who become 
heavy smokers are, in some way, exposed to other 
potential causes of lung cancer, e.g. they live in 
areas of high air pollution or they have an inherited 
tendency to cancer of the lung. These alternatives 
are not very convincing, particularly when there  
is such an extensive list of ailments associated  
with smoking.

This is not to say that smoking is the only cause 

of lung cancer or that everyone who smokes will 
eventually develop lung cancer. There are likely 
to be complex interactions between life-styles, 
environments and genetic backgrounds which could 
lead, in some cases, to lung cancer. Smoking may 
be only a part, but a very important part, of these 
interactions.

Performance-enhancing hormones
In the last 30 years or so, some athletes and sports 
persons have made use of drugs to boost their 
performance. Some of these drugs are synthetic 
forms of hormones.

Testosterone is made in the testes of males and 

is responsible for promoting male primary and 
secondary sexual characteristics. Taking testosterone 
supplements (known as ‘doping’) leads to increased 
muscle and bone mass. The practice therefore 
has the potential to enhance a sportsperson’s 
performance.

Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of 

testosterone. They affect protein metabolism, 
increasing muscle development and reducing body 
fat. Athletic performance is thus enhanced. There 
are serious long-term effects of taking anabolic 
steroids. The list is a long one but the main effects 
are sterility, masculinisation in women, and liver and 
kidney malfunction.

An internationally famous athlete caught using 
performance enhancing drugs was Ben Johnson 
(Figure 15.7), who represented Canada as a sprinter. 
He gained medals in the 1987 World Championships 
and the 1988 Olympics, but these were withdrawn 
after a urine sample tested positive for anabolic 
steroids.

 15  Drugs

Because these drugs enhance performance beyond 
what could be achieved by normal training, they 
are deemed unfair and banned by most sports 
organisations. Anabolic steroids are universally 
banned but different sports regulatory bodies have 
different rules for other substances.

The products of the steroid hormones can 

be detected in the urine and this is the basis of 
most tests for banned substances. Without these 
regulations, sport would become a competition 
between synthetic chemical substances rather than 
between individuals and teams.

blue). Johnson would later be banned from international athletics for life 
for using anabolic steroids.

No organism can live for ever, but part of it lives 
on in its offspring. Offspring are produced by 
the process of reproduction. This process may be 
sexual or asexual, but in either case it results in the 
continuation of the species.

●● Asexual reproduction
Key defi nition
Asexual reproduction is the process resulting in the 

production of genetically identical offspring from one 
parent.

Asexual means ‘without sex’ and this method of 
reproduction does not involve gametes (sex cells). 
In the single-celled protoctista or in bacteria, the cell 
simply divides into two and each new cell becomes an 
independent organism. 

In more complex organisms, part of the body may 

grow and develop into a separate individual. For 
example, a small piece of stem planted in the soil may 
form roots and grow into a complete plant.

Bacteria reproduce by cell division or fi ssion. Any 
bacterial cell can divide into two and each daughter 
cell becomes an independent bacterium (Figure 1.31). 
In some cases, this cell division can take place every 
20 minutes so that, in a very short time, a large 
colony of bacteria can be produced. This is one 
reason why a small number of bacteria can seriously 
contaminate our food products (see Chapter 10). 
This kind of reproduction, without the formation of 
gametes (sex cells), is called asexual reproduction.
Asexual reproduction in fungi
Fungi have sexual and asexual methods of 
reproduction. In the asexual method they produce 
single-celled, haploid spores. These are dispersed, 
often by air currents and, if they reach a suitable 
situation, they grow new hyphae, which develop into 
a mycelium (see Figures 1.25 and 1.26).

Penicillium and Mucor are examples of mould 

fungi that grow on decaying food or vegetable 
matter. Penicillium is a genus of mould fungi that 
grows on decaying vegetable matter, damp leather

and citrus fruits. The mycelium grows over the food, 
digesting it and absorbing nutrients. Vertical hyphae 
grow from the mycelium and, at their tips, produce 
chains of spores (Figures 16.1 and 16.2). These 
give the colony a blue-green colour and a powdery 
appearance (see Figure 19.17). The spores are 
dispersed by air currents and, if they reach a suitable 
substrate, grow into a new mycelium.

Mucor feeds, grows and reproduces in a similar way 
to Penicillium, but Mucor produces spores in a 
slightly different way. Instead of chains of spores at 
the tips of the vertical hyphae, Mucor forms spherical 
sporangia, each containing hundreds of spores 
(Figure 16.3). These are dispersed on the feet of 
insects or by the splashes of rain drops.

The gills on the underside of a mushroom or 

toadstool (Figures 16.4 and 16.5) produce spores. 
Puffballs release clouds of spores (Figure 16.6).

margin. When they fall to the soil below, they grow into independent plants.

Asexual reproduction in flowering 
plants (vegetative propagation)
Although all flowering plants reproduce sexually (that 
is why they have flowers), many of them also have 
asexual methods.

Several of these asexual methods (also called 
‘vegetative propagation’) are described below. 
When vegetative propagation takes place naturally, it 
usually results from the growth of a lateral bud on a 
stem which is close to, or under, the soil. Instead of 
just making a branch, the bud produces a complete 
plant with roots, stem and leaves. When the old stem 
dies, the new plant is independent of the parent that 
produced it.

An unusual method of vegetative propagation is 

shown by Bryophyllum (Figure 16.7).

Stolons and rhizomes
The flowering shoots of plants such as the 
strawberry and the creeping buttercup are very 
short and, for the most part, below ground. The 
stems of shoots such as these are called rootstocks. 
The rootstocks bear leaves and flowers. After the 
main shoot has flowered, the lateral buds produce 
long shoots, which grow horizontally over the 
ground (Figure 16.8). These shoots are called 
stolons (or ‘runners’), and have only small, scale-

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   215

leaves at their nodes and very long internodes. At 
each node there is a bud that can produce not only 
a shoot, but roots as well. Thus a complete plant 
may develop and take root at the node, nourished 
for a time by food sent from the parent plant 
through the stolon. Eventually, the stolon dries 
up and withers, leaving an independent daughter 
plant growing a short distance away from the 
parent. In this way a strawberry plant can produce 
many daughter plants by vegetative propagation in 
addition to producing seeds.

In many plants, horizontal shoots arise from 

lateral buds near the stem base, and grow under 
the ground. Such underground horizontal 
stems are called rhizomes. At the nodes of 
the rhizome are buds, which may develop to 
produce shoots above the ground. The shoots 
become independent plants when the connecting 
rhizome dies.

and below ground. The bracken fronds you see in 
summer are produced from lateral buds on a rhizome 
many centimetres below the soil.

Many grasses propagate by rhizomes; the couch 
grass (Figure 16.9) is a good example. Even a small 
piece of rhizome, provided it has a bud, can produce 
a new plant.

In the bracken, the entire stem is horizontal

Bulbs and corms
Bulbs such as those of the daffodil and snowdrop are 
very short shoots. The stem is only a few millimetres 
long and the leaves which encircle the stem are thick 
and fl eshy with stored food.

In spring, the stored food is used by a rapidly 

growing terminal bud, which produces a fl owering 
stalk and a small number of leaves. During the 
growing season, food made in the leaves is sent to the 
leaf bases and stored. The leaf bases swell and form a 
new bulb ready for growth in the following year.
Vegetative reproduction occurs when some of 

the food is sent to a lateral bud as well as to the leaf 
bases. The lateral bud grows inside the parent bulb 
and, next year, will produce an independent plant 
(Figure 16.10).

The corms of crocuses and anemones have life 
cycles similar to those of bulbs but it is the stem, 
rather than the leaf bases, which swells with stored 
food. Vegetative reproduction takes place when 
a lateral bud on the short, fat stem grows into an 
independent plant.

In many cases the organs associated with asexual 
reproduction also serve as food stores. Food in the 
storage organs enables very rapid growth in the 
spring. A great many of the spring and early summer 
plants have bulbs, corms, rhizomes or tubers: daffodil, 
snowdrop and bluebell, crocus and cuckoo pint, iris 
and lily-of-the-valley and lesser celandine.

Potatoes are stem tubers. Lateral buds at the base 

of the potato shoot produce underground shoots

Asexual reproduction

(rhizomes). These rhizomes swell up with stored 
starch and form tubers (Figure 16.11(a)). Because 
the tubers are stems, they have buds. If the tubers 
are left in the ground or transplanted, the buds 
will produce shoots, using food stored in the tuber 
(Figure 16.11(b)). In this way, the potato plant can 
propagate vegetatively.

plants. This can be done naturally, e.g. by planting 
potatoes, dividing up rootstocks or pegging down 
stolons at their nodes to make them take root. 
There are also methods that would not occur 
naturally in the plant’s life cycle. Two methods of 
artifi cial propagation are by taking cuttings and by 
tissue culture.

Cuttings
It is possible to produce new individuals from certain 
plants by putting the cut end of a shoot into water 
or moist earth. Roots (Figure 16.12) grow from 
the base of the stem into the soil while the shoot 
continues to grow and produce leaves.

In practice, the cut end of the stem may be treated 
with a rooting ‘hormone’ (a type of auxin – see 
‘Tropic responses’ in Chapter 14) to promote 
root growth, and evaporation from the shoot is 
reduced by covering it with polythene or a glass jar. 
Carnations, geraniums and chrysanthemums are 
commonly propagated from cuttings.

Tissue culture
Once a cell has become part of a tissue it usually 
loses the ability to reproduce. However, the nucleus 
of any cell in a plant still holds all the ‘instructions’ 
(Chapter 17) for making a complete plant and in 
certain circumstances they can be brought back 
into action.

In laboratory conditions, single plant cells can be 

induced to divide and grow into complete plants. 
One technique is to take small pieces of plant tissue 

217

 16  RepRoduction

from a root or stem and treat it with enzymes to 
separate it into individual cells. The cells are then 
provided with particular plant ‘hormones’, which 
induce cell division and, eventually, the formation of 
roots, stems and leaves.

An alternative method is to start with a small 

piece of tissue and place it on a nutrient jelly. Cells 
in the tissue start to divide and produce many 
cells, forming a shapeless mass called a callus. If 
the callus is then provided with the appropriate 
hormones it develops into a complete plant 
(Figure 16.13).

Asexual reproduction in animals
Some species of invertebrate animals are able to 
reproduce asexually.

Hydra is a small animal, 5–10 mm long, which 

lives in ponds attached to pondweed. It traps small 
animals with its tentacles, swallows and digests 
them. Hydra reproduces sexually by releasing 
its male and female gametes into the water but 
it also has an asexual method, which is shown in 
Figure 16.15.

Using the technique of tissue culture, large numbers 
of plants can be produced from small amounts of 
tissue (Figure 16.14) and they have the advantage 
of being free from fungal or bacterial infections. 
The plants produced in this way form clones, 
because they have been produced from a single 
parent plant.

The advantages and disadvantages 
of asexual reproduction 
The advantages and disadvantages of asexual 
reproduction discussed below are in the context 
of flowering plants. However, the points made 
are equally applicable to most forms of asexual 
reproduction.

In asexual reproduction no gametes are involved 
and all the new plants are produced by cell division 
(‘Mitosis’, Chapter 17) from only one parent. 
Consequently they are genetically identical; 
there is no variation. A population of genetically 
identical individuals produced from a single 
parent is called a clone. This has the advantage 
of preserving the ‘good’ characteristics of a 
successful species from generation to generation. 
The disadvantage is that there is no variability for 
natural selection (Chapter 18) to act on in the 
process of evolution.

In natural conditions in the wild it might be 
a disadvantage to have no variation in a species. 
If the climate or other conditions change and a 
vegetatively produced plant has no resistance to a 
particular disease, the whole population could be 
wiped out. 

In agriculture and horticulture, asexual 

reproduction (vegetative propagation) is exploited 
to preserve desirable qualities in crops: the good 
characteristics of the parent are passed on to all the 
offspring. With a flower such as a daffodil, the bulbs 
produced can be guaranteed to produce the same 
shape and colour of flower from one generation to 
the next. In some cases, such as tissue culture, the 
young plants grown can be transported much more 
cheaply than, for example, potato tubers as the latter 
are much heavier and more bulky. Growth of new 
plants by asexual reproduction tends to be a quick 
process. 

Sexual reproduction

 Dispersal
A plant that reproduces vegetatively will already be 
growing in a favourable situation, so all the offspring 
will find themselves in a suitable environment. 
However, there is no vegetative dispersal mechanism 
and the plants will grow in dense colonies, 
competing with each other for water and minerals. 
The dense colonies, on the other hand, leave little 
room for competitors of other species.

As mentioned before, most plants that reproduce 
vegetatively also produce flowers and seeds. In this 
way they are able to colonise more distant habitats.
 Food storage
The store of food in tubers, tap roots, bulbs, 
etc. enables the plants to grow rapidly as soon 
as conditions become favourable. Early growth 
enables the plant to flower and produce seeds before 
competition with other plants (for water, mineral 
salts and light) reaches its maximum. This must be 
particularly important in woods where, in summer, 
the leaf canopy prevents much light from reaching 
the ground and the tree roots tend to drain the soil 
of moisture over a wide area.

Table 16.1  Summary: advantages and disadvantages of asexual 
reproduction

Disadvantages
There is little variation created, 
so adaptation to a changing 
environment (evolution) is unlikely.
If the parent has no resistance to 
a particular disease, none of the 
offspring will have resistance.
Lack of dispersal (e.g. with potato 
tubers) can lead to competition for 
nutrients, water and light.

Advantages
No mate is needed.
No gametes are needed.
All the good characteristics of 
the parent are passed on to the 
offspring.
Where there is no dispersal (e.g. 
with potato tubers), offspring 
will grow in the same favourable 
environment as the parent.
Plants that reproduce asexually 
usually store large amounts of 
food that allow rapid growth 
when conditions are suitable.

●● Sexual reproduction

Key definitions
Sexual reproduction is a process involving the fusion 

of two gametes (sex cells) to form a zygote and the 
production of offspring that are genetically different 
from each other. 

Fertilisation is the fusion of gamete nuclei.

The following statements apply equally to plants  
and animals. Sexual reproduction involves the 
production of sex cells. These sex cells are called 
gametes and they are made in reproductive organs. 
The process of cell division that produces the 
gametes is called meiosis (Chapter 17). In sexual 
reproduction, the male and female gametes come 
together and fuse, that is, their cytoplasm and nuclei 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   219

 16  RepRoduction

join together to form a single cell called a zygote. 
The zygote then grows into a new individual (see 
Figure 16.30). 

In flowering plants the male gametes are found 

in pollen grains and the female gametes, called 
egg cells, are present in ovules. In animals, male 
gametes are sperm and female gametes are eggs. 
Details of fertilisation are given later in this 
chapter. 

In both plants and animals, the male gamete is 

microscopic and mobile (i.e. can move from one place 
to another). The sperm swim to the ovum; the pollen 
cell moves down the pollen tube (Figure 16.16).  
The female gametes are always larger than the male

Chromosome numbers
In normal body cells (somatic cells) the chromosomes 
are present in the nucleus in pairs. Humans, for 
example, have 46 chromosomes: 23 pairs. Maize 
(sweetcorn) has 10 pairs. This is known as the 
diploid number. When gametes are formed, the 
number of chromosomes in the nucleus of each sex 
cell is halved. This is the haploid number. During 
fertilisation, when the nuclei of the sex cells fuse, a 
zygote is formed. It gains the chromosomes from 
both gametes, so it is a diploid cell (see Chapter 17).

The advantages and disadvantages 
of sexual reproduction
In plants, the gametes may come from the same 
plant or from different plants of the same species. In 
either case, the production and subsequent fusion 
of gametes produce a good deal of variation among 
the offspring (see Chapter 18). This may result from 
new combinations of characteristics, e.g. petal colour 
of one parent combined with fruit size of the other. 
It may also be the result of spontaneous changes in 
the gametes when they are produced.

Variation can have its disadvantages: some 

combinations will produce less successful individuals. 
On the other hand, there are likely to be some more 
successful combinations that have greater survival 
value or produce individuals which can thrive in new 
or changing environments.

In a population of plants that have been produced 

sexually, there is a chance that at least some of the 

gametes and are not mobile. Pollination in seed-
bearing plants and mating in most animals bring the 
male and female gametes close together.

offspring will have resistance to disease. These plants 
will survive and produce further offspring with 
disease resistance.

The seeds produced as a result of sexual 

reproduction will be scattered over a relatively wide 
range. Some will land in unsuitable environments, 
perhaps lacking light or water. These seeds will fail 
to germinate. Nevertheless, most methods of seed 
dispersal result in some of the seeds establishing 
populations in new habitats.

The seeds produced by sexual reproduction all 
contain some stored food but it is quickly used up 
during germination, which produces only a miniature 
plant. It takes a long time for a seedling to become 
established and eventually produce seeds of its own.

 Sexual reproduction is exploited in agriculture 

and horticulture to produce new varieties of animals 
and plants by cross-breeding. 

Cross-breeding
It is possible for biologists to use their knowledge 
of genetics (see ‘Monohybrid inheritance’ in 
Chapter 17) to produce new varieties of plants 
and animals. For example, suppose one variety of 
wheat produces a lot of grain but is not resistant to 
a fungus disease. Another variety is resistant to the 
disease but has only a poor yield of grain. If these 
two varieties are cross-pollinated (Figure 16.17), the 
F1 (which means ‘first filial generation’) offspring 
should be disease-resistant and give a good yield of 
grain (assuming that the useful characteristics are 
controlled by dominant genes).

●● Sexual reproduction in 

plants

Flowers are reproductive structures; they contain the 
reproductive organs of the plant. The male organs 
are the stamens, which produce pollen. The female 
organs are the carpels. After fertilisation, part of the 
carpel becomes the fruit of the plant and contains the 
seeds. In the flowers of most plants there are both 
stamens and carpels. These flowers are, therefore, 
both male and female, a condition known as bisexual 
or hermaphrodite.

Some species of plants have unisexual flowers, i.e. 
any one flower will contain either stamens or carpels 
but not both. Sometimes both male and female 
flowers are present on the same plant, e.g. the hazel, 
which has male and female catkins on the same tree. 
In the willow tree, on the other hand, the male and 
female catkins are on different trees.

The male gamete is a cell in the pollen grain. The 

female gamete is an egg cell in the ovule. The process 
that brings the male gamete within reach of the 

Sexual reproduction in plants

A long-term disadvantage of selective breeding is the 
loss of variability. By eliminating all the offspring who 
do not bear the desired characteristics, many genes are 
lost from the population. At some future date, when 
new combinations of genes are sought, some of the 
potentially useful ones may no longer be available.

You will find more information on cross-breeding 

in ‘Selection’, Chapter 18.
Table 16.2  Summary: advantages and disadvantages of sexual 
reproduction

Disadvantages
Two parents are usually needed 
(though not always – some plants 
can self-pollinate).
Growth of a new plant to maturity 
from a seed is slow.

Advantages
There is variation in the 
offspring, so adaptation to a 
changing or new environment 
is likely, enabling survival of the 
species.
New varieties can be created, 
which may have resistance to 
disease.
In plants, seeds are produced, 
which allow dispersal away 
from the parent plant, reducing 
competition.

female gamete (i.e. from stamen to stigma) is called 
pollination. The pollen grain grows a microscopic tube, 
which carries the male gamete the last few millimetres 
to reach the female gamete for fertilisation. The zygote 
then grows to form the seed. These processes are all 
described in more detail later in this chapter.

Petals are usually brightly coloured and sometimes 
scented. They are arranged in a circle (Figure 16.18) 
or a cylinder. Most flowers have from four to ten 
petals. Sometimes they are joined together to form 
a tube (Figures 16.20 and 16.21) and the individual 
petals can no longer be distinguished. The colour and 
scent of the petals attract insects to the flower; the 
insects may bring about pollination.

The flowers of grasses and many trees do not have 
petals but small, leaf-like structures that enclose the 
reproductive organs (Figures 16.28 and 16.29).

Figure 16.21  Daffodil flower. Outline drawing of Figure 16.20. In 
daffodils, lilies, tulips, etc. (monocots) there is no distinction between 
sepals and petals.

Sepals
Outside the petals is a ring of sepals. They are often 
green and much smaller than the petals. They may 
protect the flower when it is in the bud.
Stamens
The stamens are the male reproductive organs of a 
flower. Each stamen has a stalk called the filament, 
with an anther on the end. Flowers such as the 
buttercup and blackberry have many stamens; others 
such as the tulip have a small number, often the 
same as, or double, the number of petals or sepals. 
Each anther consists of four pollen sacs in which the 
pollen grains are produced by cell division. When the 
anthers are ripe, the pollen sacs split open and release 
their pollen (see Figure 16.26).
Pollen
Insect-pollinated flowers tend to produce smaller 
amounts of pollen grains (Figure 16.22(a)), which 
are often round and sticky, or covered in tiny spikes 
to attach to the furry bodies of insects.

Wind-pollinated flowers tend to produce 

larger amounts of smooth, light pollen grains 
(Figure 16.22(b)), which are easily carried by the 
wind. Large amounts are needed because much of 
the pollen is lost: there is a low chance of it reaching 
another flower of the same species.
Carpels
These are the female reproductive organs. Flowers 
such as the buttercup and blackberry have a large 
number of carpels while others, such as the lupin, 
have a single carpel. Each carpel consists of an ovary, 
bearing a style and a stigma.

Sexual reproduction in plants

Inside the wings are two more petals joined together 
to form a boat-shaped keel.

The single carpel is long, narrow and pod shaped, 

with about ten ovules in the ovary. The long style 
ends in a stigma just inside the pointed end of the 
keel. There are ten stamens: five long ones and five 
short ones. Their filaments are joined together at the 
base to form a sheath around the ovary.

The flowers of peas and beans are very similar to 

those of lupins.

The shoots or branches of a plant carrying groups

Figure 16.22  Pollen grains 

Inside the ovary there are one or more ovules. 
Each blackberry ovary contains one ovule but the 
wallflower ovary contains several. The ovule will 
become a seed, and the whole ovary will become a 
fruit. (In biology, a fruit is the fertilised ovary of a 
flower, not necessarily something to eat.)

The style and stigma project from the top of the 

ovary. The stigma has a sticky surface and pollen 
grains will stick to it during pollination. The style 
may be quite short (e.g. wallflower, Figure 16.18) or 
very long (e.g. daffodil, Figures 16.20 and 16.21).
Receptacle
The flower structures just described are all attached 
to the expanded end of a flower stalk. This is called 
the receptacle and, in a few cases after fertilisation,  
it becomes fleshy and edible (e.g. apple and pear).

Lupin
The lupin flower is shown in Figures 16.23 to 
16.25. There are five sepals but these are joined 
together forming a short tube. The five petals are 
of different shapes and sizes. The uppermost, called 
the standard, is held vertically. Two petals at the 
sides are called wings and are partly joined together.

Figure 16.25  Lupin inflorescence. There are a hundred or more flowers 
in each inflorescence. The youngest flowers, at the top, have not yet 
opened. The oldest flowers are at the bottom and have already been 
pollinated.

Pollination
Key definition
Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to 

the stigma.

The transfer of pollen from the anthers to the 
stigma is called pollination. The anthers split 
open, exposing the microscopic pollen grains 
(Figure 16.26). The pollen grains are then carried 
away on the bodies of insects, or simply blown by the 
wind, and may land on the stigma of another flower. 

Insect pollination
Lupin flowers have no nectar. The bees that visit 
them come to collect pollen, which they take back to 
the hive for food. Other members of the lupin family 
(Leguminosae, e.g. clover) do produce nectar.
The weight of the bee, when it lands on the 

flower’s wings, pushes down these two petals and 
the petals of the keel. The pollen from the anthers

has collected in the tip of the keel and, as the petals 
are pressed down, the stigma and long stamens push 
the pollen out from the keel on to the underside of 
the bee (Figure 16.27). The bee, with pollen grains 
sticking to its body, then flies to another flower. If 
this flower is older than the first one, it will already 
have lost its pollen. When the bee’s weight pushes 
the keel down, only the stigma comes out and 
touches the insect’s body, picking up pollen grains on 
its sticky surface.

Lupin and wallflower are examples of insect-

pollinated flowers.

Wind pollination
Grasses, cereals and many trees are pollinated not 
by insects but by wind currents. The flowers are 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   224

8/18/14   9:51 PM

often quite small with inconspicuous, green, leaf-like 
bracts, rather than petals. They produce no nectar. 
The anthers and stigma are not enclosed by the bracts 
but are exposed to the air. The pollen grains, being 
light and smooth, may be carried long distances by 
the moving air and some of them will be trapped on 
the stigmas of other flowers.

In the grasses, at first, the feathery stigmas 

protrude from the flower, and pollen grains floating 
in the air are trapped by them. Later, the anthers 
hang outside the flower (Figures 16.28 and 16.29), 
the pollen sacs split and the wind blows the pollen 
away. This sequence varies between species.

If the branches of a birch or hazel tree with ripe 

male catkins, or the flowers of the ornamental pampas 
grass, are shaken, a shower of pollen can easily be seen.

Sexual reproduction in plants

Most insect-pollinated flowers have brightly 

coloured petals and scent, which attract a variety of 
insects. Some flowers produce nectar, which is also 
attractive to many insects. The dark lines (‘honey 
guides’) on petals are believed to help direct the 
insects to the nectar source and thus bring them into 
contact with the stamens and stigma.

These features are adaptations to insect pollination 
in general, but are not necessarily associated with any 
particular insect species. The various petal colours 
and the nectaries of the wallflower attract a variety of 
insects. Many flowers, however, have modifications 
that adapt them to pollination by only one type or 
species of insect. Flowers such as the honeysuckle, 
with narrow, deep petal tubes, are likely to be 
pollinated only by moths or butterflies, whose long 
‘tongues’ can reach down the tube to the nectar.
Tube-like flowers such as foxgloves need to be 
visited by fairly large insects to effect pollination. 
The petal tube is often lined with dense hairs, which 
impede small insects that would take the nectar 
without pollinating the flower. A large bumble-bee, 
however, pushing into the petal tube, is forced to rub 
against the anthers and stigma.

Many tropical and sub-tropical flowers are adapted 
to pollination by birds, or even by mammals such as 
bats and mice.

Wind-pollinated flowers are adapted to their method 

of pollination by producing large quantities of light 
pollen, and having anthers and stigmas that project 
outside the flower (Figures 16.28 and 16.29). Many 
grasses have anthers that are not rigidly attached to the 
filaments and can be shaken by the wind. The stigmas 
of grasses are feathery, providing a large surface area, 
and act as a net that traps passing pollen grains.

Figure 16.28  Grass flowers. Note that the anthers hang 
freely outside the bracts.

Adaptation
Insect-pollinated flowers are considered to be adapted 
in various ways to their method of pollination. The 
term ‘adaptation’ implies that, in the course of 
evolution, the structure and physiology of a flower 
have been modified in ways that improve the chances 
of successful pollination by insects.

Practical work

The growth of pollen tubes
Method A

n  Make a solution of 15 g sucrose and 0.1 g sodium borate in 

100 cm3 water. 

n  Put a drop of this solution on a cavity slide and scatter some 

pollen grains on the drop. This can be done by scraping an 
anther (which must already have opened to expose the pollen) 
with a mounted needle, or simply by touching the anther on 
the liquid drop.

n  Cover the drop with a coverslip and examine the slide under 

the microscope at intervals of about 15 minutes. In some 
cases, pollen tubes may be seen growing from the grains.
n  Suitable plants include lily, narcissus, tulip, bluebell, lupin, 
wallflower, sweet pea or deadnettle, but a 15% sucrose 
solution may not be equally suitable for all of them. It may be 
necessary to experiment with solutions ranging from 5 to 20%.

Method B

n  Cut the stigma from a mature flower, e.g. honeysuckle, crocus, 

evening primrose or chickweed, and place it on a slide in a 
drop of 0.5% methylene blue. 

n  Squash the stigma under a coverslip (if the stigma is large, it 

may be safer to squash it between two slides), and leave it for 
5 minutes.

meet

n  Put a drop of water on one side of the slide, just touching 

the edge of the coverslip, and draw it under the coverslip by 
holding a piece of filter paper against the opposite edge. This 
will remove excess stain.

n  If the squash preparation is now examined under the 

microscope, pollen tubes may be seen growing between the 
spread-out cells of the stigma.

Fertilisation
Pollination is complete when pollen from an 
anther has landed on a stigma. If the flower is to 
produce seeds, pollination has to be followed by a 
process called fertilisation. In all living organisms, 
fertilisation happens when a male sex cell and a 
female sex cell meet and join together (they are said 
to fuse together). The cell that is formed by this 
fusion is called a zygote and develops into an embryo 
of an animal or a plant (Figure 16.30). The sex cells 
of all living organisms are called gametes.

In flowering plants, the male gamete is in the pollen 

grain; the female gamete, called the egg cell, is in the 
ovule. For fertilisation to occur, the nucleus of the 
male cell from the pollen grain has to reach the female 
nucleus of the egg cell in the ovule, and fuse with it.

●● Extension work
Germination
The stages of germination of a French bean are 
shown in Figure 16.31.

A seed just shed from its parent plant contains 

only 5–20% water, compared with 80–90% in mature 
plant tissues. Once in the soil, some seeds will absorb 
water and swell up, but will not necessarily start to 
germinate until other conditions are suitable.

The radicle grows first and bursts through the 
testa (Figure 16.31(a)). The radicle continues to 
grow down into the soil, pushing its way between 
soil particles and small stones. Its tip is protected 
by the root cap (see ‘Water uptake’ in Chapter 8). 
Branches, called lateral roots, grow out from the 
side of the main root and help to anchor it firmly 
in the soil. On the main root and the lateral roots, 
microscopic root hairs grow out. These are fine 
outgrowths from some of the outer cells. They make 
close contact with the soil particles and absorb water 
from the spaces between them.

Sexual reproduction in plants

(Figure 16.31(b)), now starts to elongate. The 
radicle is by now firmly anchored in the soil, so the 
rapidly growing hypocotyl arches upwards through 
the soil, pulling the cotyledons with it (Figure 
16.31(c)). Sometimes the cotyledons are pulled out 
of the testa, leaving it below the soil, and sometimes 
the cotyledons remain enclosed in the testa for a 
time. In either case, the plumule is well protected 
from damage while it is being pulled through the 
soil, because it is enclosed between the cotyledons 
(Figure 16.31(d)).

Once the cotyledons are above the soil, the 
hypocotyl straightens up and the leaves of the 
plumule open out (Figure 16.31(e)). Up to this 
point, all the food needed for making new cells and 
producing energy has come from the cotyledons.
The main type of food stored in the cotyledons 
is starch. Before this can be used by the growing 
shoot and root, the starch has to be turned into 
soluble sugar. In this form, it can be transported by 
the phloem cells. The change from starch to sugar 
in the cotyledons is brought about by enzymes, 
which become active as soon as the seed starts to

germinate. The cotyledons shrivel as their food 
reserve is used up, and they fall off altogether soon 
after they have been brought above the soil.
By now the plumule leaves have grown 
much larger, turned green and started to 
absorb sunlight and make their own food by 
photosynthesis (page 66). Between the plumule 
leaves is a growing point, which continues the 
upward growth of the stem and the production 
of new leaves. The embryo has now become an 
independent plant, absorbing water and mineral 
salts from the soil, carbon dioxide from the air and 
making food in its leaves.

The importance of water, oxygen and 
temperature in germination
Use of water in the seedling
Most seeds, when first dispersed, contain very little 
water. In this dehydrated state, their metabolism is 
very slow and their food reserves are not used up. The 
dry seeds can also resist extremes of temperature and 
desiccation. Before the metabolic changes needed for 
germination can take place, seeds must absorb water.

Water is absorbed firstly through the micropyle, in 
some species, and then through the testa as a whole. 
Once the radicle has emerged, it will absorb water 
from the soil, particularly through the root hairs. 
The water that reaches the embryo and cotyledons 
is used to:
●  activate the enzymes in the seed
●  help the conversion of stored starch to sugar, and 

●  transport the sugar in solution from the cotyledons 

proteins to amino acids

to the growing regions

●  expand the vacuoles of new cells, causing the root 

and shoot to grow and the leaves to expand
●  maintain the turgor (Chapter 3) of the cells 

and thus keep the shoot upright and the leaves 
expanded

●  provide the water needed for photosynthesis once 

the plumule and young leaves are above ground

●  transport salts from the soil to the shoot.

Uses of oxygen
In some seeds the testa is not very permeable to 
oxygen, and the early stages of germination are 
probably anaerobic (Chapter 12). The testa when 
soaked or split open allows oxygen to enter. The 
oxygen is used in aerobic respiration, which provides 

228

the energy for the many chemical changes involved 
in mobilising the food reserves and making the new 
cytoplasm and cell walls of the growing seedling.

Importance of temperature
In Chapter 5 it was explained that a rise in 
temperature speeds up most chemical reactions, 
including those taking place in living organisms. 
Germination, therefore, occurs more rapidly at high 
temperatures, up to about 40°C. Above 45°C, the 
enzymes in the cells are denatured and the seedlings 
would be killed. Below certain temperatures  
(e.g. 0–4°C) germination may not start at all in some 
seeds. However, there is considerable variation in 
the range of temperatures at which seeds of different 
species will germinate.

●● Extension work
Germination and light
Since a great many cultivated plants are grown 
from seeds which are planted just below soil level, 
it seems obvious that light is not necessary for 
germination. There are some species, however, 
in which the seeds need some exposure to light 
before they will germinate, e.g. foxgloves and some 
varieties of lettuce. In all seedlings, once the shoot is 
above ground, light is necessary for photosynthesis.
Dormancy
When plants shed their seeds in summer and 
autumn, there is usually no shortage of water, 
oxygen and warmth. Yet, in a great many species, 
the seeds do not germinate until the following 
spring. These seeds are said to be dormant, i.e. 
there is some internal control mechanism that 
prevents immediate germination even though the 
external conditions are suitable.

If the seeds did germinate in the autumn, the 

seedlings might be killed by exposure to frost, 
snow and freezing conditions. Dormancy delays the 
period of germination so that adverse conditions are 
avoided.

The controlling mechanisms are very varied and 
are still the subject of investigation and discussion. 
The factors known to influence dormancy are 
plant growth substances (see ‘Tropic responses’ in 
Chapter 14), the testa, low temperature and light, 
or a combination of these.

The environmental conditions that might be expected to affect

n  Place equal numbers of soaked seeds in all three. 
n  Leave A quite dry; add water to B to make the cotton wool 

moist; add water to C until all the seeds are completely 
covered (Figure 16.32). 

n  Put lids on the containers and leave them all at room 

temperature for a week.

Result
The seeds in B will germinate normally. Those in A will not 
germinate. The seeds in C may have started to germinate but will 
probably not be as advanced as those in B and may have died 
and started to decay.

Interpretation
Although water is necessary for germination, too much of it 
may prevent germination by cutting down the oxygen supply to 
the seed.

2  The need for oxygen

n  Set up the experiment as shown in Figure 16.33. 

  CARE: Pyrogallic acid and sodium hydroxide is a caustic 

mixture. Use eye shields, handle the liquids with care and 
report any spillage at once.

n  If the moist cotton wool is rolled in some cress seeds, they will 

stick to it. The bungs must make an airtight seal in the flask 
and the cotton wool must not touch the solution. Pyrogallic 
acid and sodium hydroxide absorb oxygen from the air, so 
the cress seeds in flask A are deprived of oxygen. Flask B is 
the control (see ‘Aerobic respiration’ in Chapter 12). This is to 
show that germination can take place in these experimental 
conditions provided oxygen is present. 

Figure 16.33  Experiment to show the need for oxygen

A

B

n  Leave the flasks for a week at room temperature.

Result
The seeds in flask B will germinate but there will be little or no 
germination in flask A.

Interpretation
The main difference between flasks A and B is that A lacks 
oxygen. Since the seeds in this flask have not germinated, it looks 
as if oxygen is needed for germination.

To show that the chemicals in flask A had not killed the seeds, 
the cotton wool can be swapped from A to B. The seeds from A 
will now germinate.

Note: Sodium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. The 

mixture (sodium hydroxide + pyrogallic acid) in flask A, therefore, 
absorbs both carbon dioxide and oxygen from the air in this flask. 
In the control flask B, the sodium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide 
but not oxygen. If the seeds in B germinate, it shows that lack of 
carbon dioxide did not affect them, whereas lack of oxygen did.

3  Temperature and germination

n  Soak some maize grains for a day and then roll them up in 

three strips of moist blotting paper as shown in Figure 16.34. 

n  Put the rolls into plastic bags. Place one in a refrigerator  

(about 4 °C), leave one upright in the room (about 20 °C) and 
put the third in a warm place such as over a radiator or, better, 
in an incubator set to 30 °C.

n  Because the seeds in the refrigerator will be in darkness, the 
other seeds must also be enclosed in a box or a cupboard, to 
exclude light. Otherwise it could be objected that it was lack of 
light rather than low temperature that affected germination.
n  After a week, examine the seedlings and measure the length 

of the roots and shoots.

Result
The seedlings kept at 30 °C will be more advanced than those at 
room temperature. The grains in the refrigerator may not have 
started to germinate at all.

Interpretation
Seeds will not germinate below a certain temperature. The 
higher the temperature, the faster the germination, at least up 
to 35–40 °C.

Controlling the variables
These experiments on germination illustrate one of 
the problems of designing biological experiments. 
You have to decide what conditions (the ‘variables’) 

Self-pollination and  
cross-pollination

Key definitions
Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the 

anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower, or 
a different flower on the same plant.

Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from 

the anther of a flower to the stigma of a flower on a 
different plant of the same species.

In self-pollinating plants, the pollen that reaches 
the stigma comes from the same flower or another 
flower on the same plant. In cross-pollination, the 
pollen is carried from the anthers of one flower to 
the stigma in a flower of another plant of the same 
species.

If a bee carried pollen from one of the younger 

flowers near the middle of a lupin plant (Figure 
16.25) to an older flower near the bottom, this 
would be self-pollination. If, however, the bee visited 
a separate lupin plant and pollinated its flowers, this 
would be cross-pollination.

could influence the results and then try to change 
only one condition at a time. The dangers are that: 
(1) some of the variables might not be controllable, 
(2) controlling some of the variables might also affect 
the condition you want to investigate, and (3) there 
might be a number of important variables you have 
not thought of.
1 In your germination experiments, you were 

unable to control the quality of the seeds, but 
had to assume that the differences between them 
would be small. If some of the seeds were dead 
or diseased, they would not germinate in any 
conditions and this could distort the results. This is 
one reason for using as large a sample as possible in 
the experiments.

2 You had to ensure that, when temperature was the 
variable, the exclusion of light from the seeds in the 
refrigerator was not an additional variable. This was 
done by putting all the seeds in darkness.

3 A variable you might not have considered could 
be the way the seeds were handled. Some seeds 
can be induced to germinate more successfully by 
scratching or chipping the testa.

The term ‘cross-pollination’, strictly speaking, 

should be applied only if there are genetic 
differences between the two plants involved. The 
flowers on a single plant all have the same genetic 
constitution. The flowers on plants growing from 
the same rhizome or rootstock (see ‘Asexual 
reproduction’ earlier in this chapter) will also have 
the same genetic constitution. Pollination between 
such flowers is little different from self-pollination in 
the same flower.

If a plant relies on self-pollination, the 

disadvantage will be that variation will not occur 
in subsequent generations. Those plants may 
not, therefore, be able to adapt to changing 
environmental conditions. However, self-
pollination can happen even if there are no 
pollinators, since the flower’s own pollen may drop 
onto its stigma. This means that even if pollinators 
are scarce (perhaps because of the reckless use 
of insecticides) the plant can produce seeds and 
prevent extinction.

Cross-pollination, on the other hand, will 

guarantee variation and give the plant species a

better chance of adapting to changing conditions. 
Some plants maintain cross-pollination by producing 
stamens (male reproductive parts) at a different 
time to the carpels (female reproductive parts). 
However, cross-pollinated plants do have a reliance 
on pollinators to carry the pollen to other plants.

Fertilisation
The pollen grain absorbs liquid from the stigma and 
a microscopic pollen tube grows out of the grain. 
This tube grows down the style and into the ovary, 
where it enters a small hole, the micropyle, in an 
ovule (Figure 16.35). The nucleus of the pollen 
grain travels down the pollen tube and enters the 
ovule. Here it combines with the nucleus of the egg 
cell. Each ovule in an ovary needs to be fertilised by 
a separate pollen grain.

Although pollination must occur before the ovule 

can be fertilised, pollination does not necessarily 
result in fertilisation. A bee may visit many flowers 
on a Bramley apple tree, transferring pollen from

called cotyledons. In dicot plants (see ‘Features of 
organisms’ in Chapter 1) food made in the leaves 
of the parent plant is carried in the phloem to the 
cotyledons.

The cotyledons eventually grow so large with 

this stored food that they completely enclose the 
embryo (see Figure 16.37). In monocot plants

As the seeds grow, the ovary also becomes much 

larger and the petals and stamens shrivel and fall 
off (Figures 16.36(b) and 16.38). The ovary is 
now called a fruit (Figure 16.36). The biological 
definition of a fruit is a fertilised ovary. It is not 
necessarily edible – the lupin ovary forms a dry pod.

●● Sexual reproduction in 

humans

Reproduction is the process of producing new 
individuals. In human reproduction the two sexes, 
male and female, each produce special types of 
reproductive cells, called gametes. The male gametes 
are the sperm (or spermatozoa) and the female 
gametes are the ova (singular = ovum) or eggs 
(Figure 16.39).

To produce a new individual, a sperm has to 

reach an ovum and join with it (fuse with it). The 
sperm nucleus then passes into the ovum and the 
two nuclei also fuse. This is fertilisation. The cell 
formed after the fertilisation of an ovum by a sperm 
is called a zygote. A zygote will grow by cell division

to produce first an embryo and then a fully formed 
animal (Figure 16.40).

In humans, the male produces millions of sperm, 

while the female produces a smaller number of 
eggs (usually one a month for about 40 years). 
Usually only one egg is fertilised at a time; two eggs 
being fertilised at the same time produces (non-
identical) twins.

To bring the sperm close enough to the ova for 
fertilisation to take place, there is an act of mating 
or copulation. In mammals this act results in sperm 
from the male animal being injected into the female. 
The sperm swim inside the female’s reproductive 
system and fertilise any eggs that are present. The 
zygote then grows into an embryo inside the body of 
the female.
The human reproductive system
Female
Table 16.4 summarises the functions of parts of 
the female reproductive system. The eggs are 
produced from the female reproductive organs 
called ovaries. These are two whitish oval bodies, 
3–4 cm long. They lie in the lower half of the 
abdomen, one on each side of the uterus (Figure 
16.41 and Figure 16.42) Close to each ovary is the 
expanded, funnel-shaped opening of the oviduct, 
the tube down which the ova pass when released 
from the ovary. The oviduct is sometimes called the 
Fallopian tube.

The oviducts are narrow tubes that open into a 

wider tube, the uterus or womb, lower down in the 
abdomen. When there is no embryo developing in 
it, the uterus is only about 80 mm long. It leads to 
the outside through a muscular tube, the vagina. 
The cervix is a ring of muscle closing the lower end 
of the uterus where it joins the vagina. The urethra, 
from the bladder, opens into the vulva just in front 
of the vagina.

Table 16.5 summarises the functions of parts of the

outside the abdominal cavity in a special sac called 
the scrotum. In this position they are kept at a

is the best temperature for sperm production.

The testes consist of a mass of sperm-producing 

tubes (Figure 16.44). These tubes join to form 
ducts leading to the epididymis, a coiled tube about 
6 metres long on the outside of each testis. The 
epididymis, in turn, leads into a muscular sperm duct.

The two sperm ducts, one from each testis, open into

A short, coiled tube called the seminal vesicle 
branches from each sperm duct just before it enters

this point. 

The urethra passes through the penis and may 

conduct either urine or sperm at different times. The 
penis consists of connective tissue with many blood 
spaces in it. This is called erectile tissue.

Production of gametes
Sperm production
The lining of the sperm-producing tubules in the 
testis consists of rapidly dividing cells (Figure 16.45). 
After a series of cell divisions, the cells grow long 
tails called flagellae (singular: flagellum) and become 
sperm (Figure 16.46), which pass into the epididymis.
During copulation, the epididymis and sperm ducts 

contract and force sperm out through the urethra. 
The prostate gland and seminal vesicle add fluid to 
the sperm. This fluid plus the sperm it contains is 
called semen, and the ejection of sperm through the 
penis is called ejaculation.

Ovulation
The egg cells (ova) are present in the ovary from the 
time of birth. No more are formed during the female’s 
lifetime, but between the ages of 10 and 14 some of

the egg cells start to mature and are released, one at 
a time about every 4 weeks from alternate ovaries. As 
each ovum matures, the cells around it divide rapidly 
and produce a fl uid-fi lled sac. This sac is called a 
follicle (Figure 16.47) and, when mature, it projects 
from the surface of the ovary like a small blister 
(Figure 16.48). Finally, the follicle bursts and releases 
the ovum with its coating of cells into the funnel of 
the oviduct. This is called ovulation. From here, the 
ovum is wafted down the oviduct by the action of cilia 
(see ‘Levels of organisation’ in Chapter 2) in the lining 
of the tube. If the ovum meets sperm cells in the 
oviduct, it may be fertilised by one of them.

The released ovum is enclosed in a jelly-like coat called 

the zona pellucida and is still surrounded by a layer 
of follicle cells. Before fertilisation can occur, sperm

ovary (×30). The ovum is surrounded by follicle cells. These produce the 
fl uid that occupies much of the space in the follicle.
have to get through this layer of cells and the 
successful sperm has to penetrate the zona pellucida 
with the aid of enzymes secreted by the head of 
the sperm.

Mating and fertilisation
Mating
Sexual arousal in the male results in an erection. 
That is, the penis becomes fi rm and erect as a result 
of blood fl owing into the erectile tissue. Arousal 
in the female stimulates the lining of the vagina to 
produce mucus. This lubricates the vagina and makes 
it easy for the erect penis to enter.

In the act of copulation, the male inserts the penis into 

the female’s vagina. The sensory stimulus (sensation) 
that this produces causes a refl ex (see ‘Nervous control

in humans’ in Chapter 14) in the male, which results in 
the ejaculation of semen into the top of the vagina.

The previous paragraph is a very simple description 
of a biological event. In humans, however, the sex act 
has intense psychological and emotional importance. 
Most people feel a strong sexual drive, which has 
little to do with the need to reproduce. Sometimes 
the sex act is simply the meeting of an urgent physical 
need. Sometimes it is an experience that both man 
and woman enjoy together. At its ‘highest’ level it is 
both of these, and is also an expression of deeply felt 
affection within a lasting relationship.

Fertilisation
The sperm swim through the cervix and into the 
uterus by wriggling movements of their tails. They 
pass through the uterus and enter the oviduct, but the 
method by which they do this is not known for certain. 
If there is an ovum in the oviduct, one of the sperm 
may bump into it and stick to its surface. The acrosome 
at the head of the sperm secretes enzymes which digest 
part of the egg membrane. The sperm then enters the 
cytoplasm of the ovum and the male nucleus of the 
sperm fuses with the female nucleus. This is the moment 
of fertilisation and is shown in more detail in Figure 
16.49. Although a single ejaculation may contain over 
three hundred million sperm, only a few hundred will 
reach the oviduct and only one will fertilise the ovum. 
The function of the others is not fully understood.

follicle cells

The released ovum is thought to survive for about 

24 hours; the sperm might be able to fertilise an 
ovum for about 2 or 3 days. So there is only a short 
period of about 4 days each month when fertilisation 
might occur. If this fertile period can be estimated 
accurately, it can be used either to achieve or to avoid 
fertilisation (conception) (see ‘Methods of birth 
control in humans’).

The fertilised egg has 23 chromosomes from 
the mother and 23 from the father, bringing its 
chromosome number to 46 (the same as other 
human body cells). It is called a zygote.

Pregnancy and development
The fertilised ovum (zygote) first divides into two 
cells. Each of these divides again, so producing  
four cells. The cells continue to divide in this way  
to produce a solid ball of cells (Figure 16.50), 
an early stage in the development of the embryo. 
This early embryo travels down the oviduct to the 
uterus. Here it sinks into the lining of the uterus, a 
process called implantation (Figure 16.52(a)). The 
embryo continues to grow and produces new cells 
that form tissues and organs (Figure 16.51). After  
8 weeks, when all the organs are formed, the 
embryo is called a fetus. One of the first organs to 
form is the heart, which pumps blood around the 
body of the embryo.

As the embryo grows, the uterus enlarges to 

contain it. Inside the uterus the embryo becomes 
enclosed in a fluid-filled sac called the amnion 
or water sac, which protects it from damage and 
prevents unequal pressures from acting on it (Figure 
16.52(b) and (c)). The fluid is called amniotic fluid. 
The oxygen and food needed to keep the embryo 
alive and growing are obtained from the mother’s 
blood by means of a structure called the placenta.

Placenta
Soon after the ball of cells reaches the uterus, some 
of the cells, instead of forming the organs of the 
embryo, grow into a disc-like structure, the placenta 
(Figure 16.52(c)). The placenta becomes closely 
attached to the lining of the uterus and is attached 
to the embryo by a tube called the umbilical cord 
(Figure 16.52(c)). The nervous system (brain, spinal 
cord and sense organs) start to develop very quickly. 
After a few weeks, the embryo’s heart has developed 
and is circulating blood through the umbilical cord 
and placenta as well as through its own tissues 
(Figure 16.51(b)). Oxygen and nutrients such as 
glucose and amino acids pass across the placenta to 
the embryo’s bloodstream. Carbon dioxide passes 
from the embryo’s blood to that of the mother. 
Blood entering the placenta from the mother does 
not mix with the embryo’s blood.

Figure 16.53 shows the human embryo at 7 weeks 

surrounded by the amnion and placenta.

Antenatal care
‘Antenatal’ or ‘prenatal’ refers to the period before 
birth. Antenatal care is the way a woman should look 
after herself during pregnancy, so that the birth will 
be safe and her baby healthy.

The mother-to-be should make sure that she eats 
properly, and perhaps takes more iron and folic acid 
(a vitamin), than she usually does to prevent anaemia. 
If her job is a light one, she may go on working for 
the first 6 months of pregnancy. She should not do 
heavy work, however, or repeated lifting or stooping.

Pregnant women who drink or smoke are more 
likely to have babies with low birth weights. These 
babies are more likely to be ill than babies of normal

weight. Smoking may also make a miscarriage more 
likely. So a woman who smokes should give up 
smoking during her pregnancy. Alcohol can cross 
the placenta and damage the fetus. Pregnant women 
who take as little as one alcoholic drink a day are at 
risk of having babies with lower than average birth 
weights. These underweight babies are more likely to 
become ill.

Heavy drinking during pregnancy, sometimes 

called ‘binge drinking’, can lead to deformed 
babies. This risk is particularly great in the early 
stages of pregnancy when the brain of the fetus is 
developing, and can result in a condition called 
fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). At that stage the 
mother may not yet be aware of her pregnancy and 
continue to drink heavily. A child suffering from 
FAS can have a range of medical problems, many 
associated with permanent brain damage. All levels 
of drinking are thought to increase the risk of 
miscarriage.

During pregnancy, a woman should not take any 

drugs unless they are strictly necessary and prescribed 
by a doctor. In the 1950s, a drug called thalidomide 
was used to treat the bouts of early morning sickness 
that often occur in the first 3 months of pregnancy. 
Although tests had appeared to show the drug 
to be safe, it had not been tested on pregnant 
animals. About 20% of pregnant women who took 
thalidomide had babies with deformed or missing 
limbs (Figure 16.54).

Figure 16.54  Children suffering from the effects of thalidomide

If a woman catches rubella (German measles) during 
the first 4 months of pregnancy, there is a danger that 
the virus may affect the fetus and cause abortion or still-
birth. Even if the baby is born alive, the virus may have 
caused defects of the eyes (cataracts), ears (deafness) or 
nervous system. All girls should be vaccinated against 
rubella to make sure that their bodies contain antibodies 
to the disease (see Chapter 10).
Twins
Sometimes a woman releases two ova when she 
ovulates. If both ova are fertilised, they may 
form twin embryos, each with its own placenta 
and amnion. Because the twins come from two 
separate ova, each fertilised by a different sperm, it 
is possible to have a boy and a girl. Twins formed 
in this way are called fraternal twins. Although 
they are both born within a few minutes of each 
other, they are no more alike than other brothers 
or sisters.

Another cause of twinning is when a single 

fertilised egg, during an early stage of cell division, 
forms two separate embryos. Sometimes these may 
share a placenta and amnion. Twins formed from 
a single ovum and sperm must be the same sex, 
because only one sperm (X or Y) fertilised the ovum. 
These ‘one-egg’ twins are sometimes called identical 
twins because, unlike fraternal twins, they will closely 
resemble each other in every respect.
Birth
The period from fertilisation to birth takes about  
38 weeks in humans. This is called the gestation 
period. A few weeks before the birth, the fetus has 
come to lie head downwards in the uterus, with its 
head just above the cervix (Figures 16.52(d) and 

238

16.55). When birth starts, the uterus begins to contract 
rhythmically. This is the beginning of what is called 
‘labour’. These regular rhythmic contractions become 
stronger and more frequent. The opening of the cervix 
gradually widens (dilates) enough to let the baby’s head 
pass through and the contractions of the muscles in 
the uterus wall are assisted by muscular contractions of 
the abdomen. The amniotic sac breaks at some stage 
in labour and the fluid escapes through the vagina. 
Finally, the muscular contractions of the uterus wall and 
abdomen push the baby head-first through the widened 
cervix and vagina (Figure 16.56). The umbilical cord, 
which still connects the child to the placenta, is tied and 
cut. Later, the placenta breaks away from the uterus 
and is pushed out separately as the ‘afterbirth’.

Sexual reproduction in humans

The sudden fall in temperature felt by the newly born 
baby stimulates it to take its first breath and it usually 
cries. In a few days, the remains of the umbilical cord 
attached to the baby’s abdomen shrivel and fall away, 
leaving a scar in the abdominal wall, called the navel.

Induced birth
Sometimes, when a pregnancy has lasted for more 
than 38 weeks or when examination shows that the 
placenta is not coping with the demands of the fetus, 
birth may be induced. This means that it is started 
artificially.

This is often done by carefully breaking the 

membrane of the amniotic sac. Another method is to 
inject a hormone, oxytocin, into the mother’s veins. 
Either of these methods brings on the start of labour. 
Sometimes both are used together.

Figure 16.55  Model of human fetus just before birth. The cervix and 
vagina seem to provide narrow channels for the baby to pass through 
but they widen quite naturally during labour and delivery.

Figure 16.56  Delivery of a baby. The umbilical cord is still intact.

Comparing male and female gametes
Figure 2.13(g) shows a sperm cell in detail. Sperm 
are much smaller than eggs and are produced in 
much larger numbers (over 300 million in a single 
ejaculation). The tip of the cell carries an acrosome, 
which secretes enzymes capable of digesting a 
path into an egg cell, through the jelly coat, so the 
sperm nucleus can fuse with the egg nucleus. The 
cytoplasm of the mid-piece of the sperm contains 
many mitochondria. They carry out respiration, 

providing energy to make the tail (flagellum) move 
and propel the sperm forward.

The egg cell (see Figure 2.13(h)) is much larger 
than a sperm cell and only one egg is released each 
month while the woman is fertile. It is surrounded 
by a jelly coat, which protects the contents of the cell 
and prevents more than one sperm from entering 
and fertilising the egg. The egg cell contains a 
large amount of cytoplasm, which is rich in fats and 
proteins. The fats act as energy stores. Proteins are 
available for growth if the egg is fertilised.

Functions of the placenta and 
umbilical cord
The blood vessels in the placenta are very close 
to the blood vessels in the uterus so that oxygen, 
glucose, amino acids and salts can pass from the 
mother’s blood to the embryo’s blood (Figure 
16.57(a)). So the blood flowing in the umbilical 
vein from the placenta carries food and oxygen to be 
used by the living, growing tissues of the embryo. 
In a similar way, the carbon dioxide and urea in 
the embryo’s blood escape from the vessels in the 
placenta and are carried away by the mother’s blood 
in the uterus (Figure 16.57(b)). In this way the 
embryo gets rid of its excretory products.

There is no direct communication between the 

mother’s blood system and that of the embryo. The 
exchange of substances takes place across the thin 
walls of the blood vessels. In this way, the mother’s 
blood pressure cannot damage the delicate vessels 
of the embryo and it is possible for the placenta 
to select the substances allowed to pass into the 
embryo’s blood. The placenta can prevent some 
harmful substances in the mother’s blood from 
reaching the embryo. It cannot prevent all of them, 
however: alcohol and nicotine can pass to the 
developing fetus. If the mother is a heroin addict, 
the baby can be born addicted to the drug.

 Some pathogens such as the rubella virus and 

HIV can pass across the placenta. Rubella (German 
measles), although a mild infection for the mother, can 

infect the fetus and results in major health problems, 
including deafness, congenital heart disease, diabetes 
and mental retardation. HIV is potentially fatal.
The placenta produces hormones, including 

oestrogens and progesterone. It is assumed 
that these hormones play an important part in 
maintaining the pregnancy and preparing for birth, 
but their precise function is not known. They may 
influence the development and activity of the muscle 
layers in the wall of the uterus and prepare the 
mammary glands in the breasts for milk production.

Feeding and parental care
Within the first 24 hours after birth, the baby starts to 
suck at the breast. During pregnancy the mammary 
glands (breasts) enlarge as a result of an increase in 
the number of milk-secreting cells. No milk is secreted 
during pregnancy, but the hormones that start the 
birth process also act on the milk-secreting cells of 
the breasts. The breasts are stimulated to release 
milk by the baby sucking the nipple. The continued 
production of milk is under the control of hormones, 
but the amount of milk produced is related to the 
quantity taken by the child during suckling.

Milk contains the proteins, fats, sugar, vitamins and 

salts that babies need for their energy requirements 
and tissue-building, but there is too little iron present 
for the manufacture of haemoglobin. All the iron 
needed for the first weeks or months is stored in the 
liver of the fetus during gestation.

The liquid produced in the first few days is called 
colostrum. It is sticky and yellow, and contains  
more protein than the milk produced later. It also 
contains some of the mother’s antibodies. This 
provides passive immunity (see Chapter 10) to 
infection.

The mother’s milk supply increases with the 
demands of the baby, up to 1 litre per day. It is 
gradually supplemented and eventually replaced 
entirely by solid food, a process known as 
weaning.

Cows’ milk is not wholly suitable for human 

babies. It has more protein, sodium and phosphorus, 
and less sugar, vitamin A and vitamin C, than human 
milk. It is less easily digested than human milk. 
Manufacturers modify the components of dried 
cows’ milk to resemble human milk more closely and 
this makes it more acceptable if the mother cannot 
breastfeed her baby.

Cows’ milk and proprietary dried milk both 

lack human antibodies, whereas the mother’s milk 
contains antibodies to any diseases from which 
she has recovered. It also carries white cells that 
produce antibodies or ingest bacteria. These 
antibodies are important in defending the baby 

Sex hormones in humans

against infection at a time when its own immune 
responses are not fully developed. Breastfeeding 
provides milk free from bacteria, whereas bottle-
feeding carries the risk of introducing bacteria 
that cause intestinal diseases. Breastfeeding also 
offers emotional and psychological benefits to both 
mother and baby.

Other advantages of breastfeeding over bottle-

feeding include the following:
• There is no risk of an allergic reaction to 

breast milk.

• Breast milk is produced at the correct 

temperature.

• There are no additives or preservatives in 

breast milk.

• Breast milk does not require sterilisation since 
there are no bacteria present that could cause 
intestinal disease.

• There is no cost involved in using breast milk.
• Breast milk does not need to be prepared.
• Breastfeeding triggers a reduction in the size of 

the mother’s uterus.

●● Sex hormones in humans
Puberty and the menstrual cycle
Puberty
Although the ovaries of a young girl contain all the 
ova she will ever produce, they do not start to be 
released until she reaches the age of about 10–14 
years. This stage in her life is known as puberty.

At about the same time as the first ovulation, the 

ovary also releases female sex hormones into the 
bloodstream. These hormones are called oestrogens 
and when they circulate around the body, they 
bring about the development of secondary sexual 
characteristics. In a girl these are the increased 
growth of the breasts, a widening of the hips and the 
growth of hair in the pubic region and in the armpits. 
There is also an increase in the size of the uterus and 
vagina. Once all these changes are complete, the girl 
is capable of having a baby.

Puberty in boys occurs at about the same age as in 

girls. The testes start to produce sperm for the first 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   241

time and also release a hormone, called testosterone, 
into the bloodstream. The male secondary sexual 
characteristics, which begin to appear at puberty, 
are enlargement of the testes and penis, deepening 
of the voice, growth of hair in the pubic region, 
armpits, chest and, later on, the face. In both sexes 
there is a rapid increase in the rate of growth during 
puberty.

In addition to the physical changes at puberty, 

there are emotional and psychological changes 
associated with the transition from being a child to 
becoming an adult, i.e. the period of adolescence. 
Most people adjust to these changes smoothly and 
without problems. Sometimes, however, a conflict 
arises between having the status of a child and the 
sexuality and feelings of an adult.

The menstrual cycle
The ovaries release an ovum about every 4 weeks. 
In preparation for this the lining of the uterus wall 
thickens, so that an embryo can embed itself if the 
released ovum is fertilised. If no implantation occurs, 

241

8/18/14   9:51 PM

 16  RepRoduction

the uterus lining breaks down. The cells, along with 
blood are passed out of the vagina. This is called 
a menstrual period. The appearance of the fi rst 

menstrual period is one of the signs of puberty in 
girls. After menstruation, the uterus lining starts to 
re-form and another ovum starts to mature.

 Hormones and the menstrual cycle
At the start of the cycle, the lining of the uterus wall 
has broken down (menstruation). As each follicle 
in the ovaries develops, the amount of oestrogens 
produced by the ovary increases. The oestrogens act 
on the uterus and cause its lining to become thicker 
and develop more blood vessels. These are changes 
that help an early embryo to implant.

Two hormones, produced by the pituitary gland 

at the base of the brain, promote ovulation. The 
hormones are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
and luteinising hormone, or lutropin (LH). They 
act on a ripe follicle and stimulate maturation and 
release of the ovum.

Once the ovum has been released, the follicle that 

produced it develops into a solid body called the 
corpus luteum. This produces a hormone called 

progesterone, which affects the uterus lining in the 
same way as the oestrogens, making it grow thicker 
and produce more blood vessels.

If the ovum is fertilised, the corpus luteum 

continues to release progesterone and so keeps the 
uterus in a state suitable for implantation. If the ovum 
is not fertilised, the corpus luteum stops producing 
progesterone. As a result, the thickened lining of the 
uterus breaks down and loses blood, which escapes 
through the cervix and vagina. The events in the 
menstrual cycle are shown in Figure 16.58.

 Menopause
Between the ages of 40 and 55, the ovaries cease to 
release ova or produce hormones. As a consequence, 
menstrual periods cease, the woman can no longer 
have children, and sexual desire is gradually reduced.

●● Methods of birth 
control in humans

As little as 4 weeks after giving birth, it is possible, 
though unlikely, that a woman may conceive again. 
Frequent breastfeeding may reduce the chances of 
conception. Nevertheless, it would be possible to 
have children at about 1-year intervals. Most people 
do not want, or cannot afford, to have as many 
children as this. All human communities, therefore, 
practise some form of birth control to space out 
births and limit the size of the family.

Natural methods of family planning
Abstinence 
This is the most obvious way of preventing a 
pregnancy. This involves a couple avoiding sexual 
intercourse. In this way, sperm cannot come into 
contact with an egg and fertilisation cannot happen.

Monitoring body temperature
If it were possible to know exactly when ovulation 
occurred, intercourse could be avoided for 3–4 days 
before and 1 day after ovulation. At the moment, 
however, there is no simple, reliable way to recognise 
ovulation, though it is usually 12–16 days before the 
onset of the next menstrual period. By keeping careful 
records of the intervals between menstrual periods, it 
is possible to calculate a potentially fertile period of 
about 10 days in mid-cycle, when sexual intercourse 
should be avoided if children are not wanted.

On its own, this method is not very reliable but 

there are some physiological clues that help to make 
it more accurate. During or soon after ovulation, 
a woman’s temperature rises by about 0.5 °C. It is 
reasonable to assume that 1 day after the temperature 
returns to normal, a woman will be infertile. 

Cervical mucus
Another clue comes from the type of mucus secreted 
by the cervix and lining of the vagina. As the time 
for ovulation approaches, the mucus becomes more 
fluid. Women can learn to detect these changes and 
so calculate their fertile period.

By combining the ‘calendar’, ‘temperature’ and 

‘mucus’ methods, it is possible to achieve about 80% 
‘success’, i.e. only 20% unplanned pregnancies. Highly 
motivated couples may achieve better rates of success 
and, of course, it is a very helpful way of finding the 
fertile period for couples who do want to conceive.

Methods of birth control in humans

Artificial methods of family planning
Barrier methods
Sheath or condom 
A thin rubber sheath is placed on the erect penis 
before sexual intercourse. The sheath traps the sperm 
and prevents them from reaching the uterus. It also 
prevents the transmission of sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs).

Diaphragm 
A thin rubber disc, placed in the vagina before 
intercourse, covers the cervix and stops sperm 
entering the uterus. Condoms and diaphragms, used 
in conjunction with chemicals that immobilise sperm, 
are about 95% effective. However, a diaphragm does 
not prevent the risk of transmission of STIs.

Femidom 
This is a female condom. It is a sheath or pouch, made 
of polyurethane or rubber, with a flexible ring at each 
end. The ring at the closed end of the sheath is inserted 
into the vagina to hold the femidom in place. The ring 
at the open end is placed outside the vagina. During 
sexual intercourse, semen is trapped inside the femidom. 
A femidom reduces the risk of infection by STIs.

Chemical methods
Spermicides
Spermicides are chemicals which, though harmless 
to the tissues, can kill or immobilise sperm. The 
spermicide, in the form of a cream, gel or foam, is 
placed in the vagina. On their own, spermicides are 
not very reliable but, in conjunction with condoms or 
diaphragms, they are effective.
Intra-uterine device (IUD) 
A small T-shaped plastic and copper device, also 
known as a coil, can be inserted by a doctor or nurse 
into the wall of the uterus, where it probably prevents 
implantation of a fertilised ovum. It is about 98% 
effective but there is a small risk of developing uterine 
infections, and it does not protect against STIs.
Intra-uterine system (IUS)
This is similar to an IUD; is T-shaped and releases 
the hormone progesterone slowly over a long period 
of time (up to 5 years). The hormone prevents 
ovulation. An IUS does not protect against STIs.
Contraceptive pill 
The pill contains chemicals, which have the same 
effect on the body as the hormones oestrogen and 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   243

243

8/18/14   9:51 PM

 16  RepRoduction

progesterone. When mixed in suitable proportions 
these hormones suppress ovulation and so prevent 
conception. The pills need to be taken each day for 
the 21 days between menstrual periods.

There are many varieties of contraceptive  

pill in which the relative proportions of  
oestrogen- and progesterone-like chemicals  
vary. They are 99% effective, but long-term use  
of some types may increase the risk of cancer of  
the breast and cervix. The pill does not protect 
against STIs.

Contraceptive implant 
This is a small plastic tube about 4 cm long,  
which is inserted under the skin of the upper  
arm of a woman by a doctor or nurse. Once in 
place it slowly releases the hormone progesterone, 
preventing pregnancy. It lasts for about 3 years.  
It does not protect against STIs, but has more  
than a 99% success rate in preventing  
pregnancy.
Contraceptive injection 
This injection, given to women, contains 
progesterone and stays effective for between 8 and 
12 weeks. It works by thickening the mucus in the 
cervix, stopping sperm reaching an egg. It also 

The use of hormones in fertility 
and contraception treatments
 Infertility
About 85–90% of couples trying for a baby achieve 
pregnancy within a year. Those that do not may be 
sub-fertile or infertile. Female infertility is usually 
caused by a failure to ovulate or a blockage or 
distortion of the oviducts. The latter can often be 
corrected by surgery.
Using hormones to improve fertility
Failure to produce ova can be treated with fertility 
drugs. These drugs are similar to hormones 
and act by increasing the levels of FSH and LH. 
Administration of the drug is timed to promote 
ovulation to coincide with copulation. 
Artificial insemination (AI)
Male infertility is caused by an inadequate quantity 
of sperm in the semen or by sperm that are 
insufficiently mobile to reach the oviducts. There 
are few effective treatments for this condition, 
but pregnancy may be achieved by artificial 

244

thins the lining of the uterus, making it unsuitable 
for implantation of an embryo. It does not protect 
against STIs.

Surgical methods
Male sterilisation – vasectomy
This is a simple and safe surgical operation in which 
the man’s sperm ducts are cut and the ends sealed. 
This means that his semen contains the secretions of 
the prostate gland and seminal vesicle but no sperm, 
so cannot fertilise an ovum. Sexual desire, erection, 
copulation and ejaculation are quite unaffected.

The testis continues to produce sperm and 

testosterone. The sperm are removed by white cells as 
fast as they form. The testosterone ensures that there 
is no loss of masculinity.

The sperm ducts can be rejoined by surgery but 

this is not always successful.
Female sterilisation – laparotomy
A woman may be sterilised by an operation in which 
her oviducts are tied, blocked or cut. The ovaries are 
unaffected. Sexual desire and menstruation continue 
as before, but sperm can no longer reach the ova. 
Ova are released, but break down in the upper part of 
the oviduct.

The operation cannot usually be reversed.

insemination (AI). This involves injecting semen 
through a tube into the top of the uterus. In some 
cases, the husband’s semen can be used but, more 
often, the semen is supplied by an anonymous 
donor.

With AI, the woman has the satisfaction of bearing 

her child rather than adopting, and 50% of the 
child’s genes are from the mother. It also allows a 
couple to have a baby that is biologically theirs if the 
man is infertile.

Apart from religious or moral objections, the 

disadvantages are that the child can never know his 
or her father and there may be legal problems about 
the legitimacy of the child in some countries.

In vitro fertilisation 
‘In vitro’ means literally ‘in glass’ or, in other words, 
the fertilisation is allowed to take place in laboratory 
glassware (hence the term ‘test-tube babies’). This 
technique may be employed where surgery cannot 
be used to repair blocked oviducts.

In vitro fertilisation has received considerable 
publicity since the first ‘test-tube’ baby was born 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   244

8/18/14   9:51 PM

in 1978. The woman may be given fertility drugs, 
which cause her ovaries to release several mature 
ova simultaneously. These ova are then collected by 
laparoscopy, i.e. they are sucked up in a fine tube 
inserted through the abdominal wall. The ova are 
then mixed with the husband’s seminal fluid and 
watched under the microscope to see if cell division 
takes place. (Figure 16.50 is a photograph of such an 
‘in vitro’ fertilised ovum.)

One or more of the dividing zygotes are then 
introduced to the woman’s uterus by means of 
a tube inserted through the cervix. Usually, only 
one (or none) of the zygotes develops, though 
occasionally there are multiple births. 

The success rate for in vitro fertilisation is between 

12 and 40% depending on how many embryos are 
transplanted. However, new research using time-
lapse photography of the developing IVF embryos 
during the first few days of life could raise the success 
rate to up to 78%. It could also reduce the cost from 
between £5000 and £10 000 for each treatment 
cycle to £750 in Britain. The photographs are used 
to select the best embryos, based on their early 
development. 

 Using hormones for contraception
Oestrogen and progesterone control important 
events in the menstrual cycle. 

Oestrogen encourages the re-growth of the 

lining of the uterus wall after a period and 

●● Sexually transmitted 

infections (STIs)

Key definition
A sexually transmitted infection is an infection that is 

transmitted via body fluids through sexual contact.

AIDS and HIV
The initials of AIDS stand for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. (A ‘syndrome’ is a pattern 
of symptoms associated with a particular disease.) 
The virus that causes AIDS is the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 

After a person has been infected, years may pass 
before symptoms develop. So people may carry the 
virus yet not show any symptoms. They can still infect 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_16.indd   245

Sexually transmitted infections (Stis)

prevents the release of FSH. If FSH is blocked, no 
further ova are matured. The uterus lining needs 
to be thick to allow successful implantation of an 
embryo.

Progesterone maintains the thickness of the 
uterine lining. It also inhibits the secretion of 
luteinising hormone (LH), which is responsible 
for ovulation. If LH is suppressed, ovulation 
cannot happen, so there are no ova to be 
fertilised. 

Because of the roles of oestrogen and 
progesterone, they are used, singly or in 
combination, in a range of contraceptive methods.

 Social implications of contraception and fertility 
treatments
Some religions are against any artificial forms of 
contraception and actively discourage the use of 
contraceptives such as the sheath and femidom. 
However, these are important in the prevention of 
transmission of STDs in addition to their role as 
contraceptives. 

Fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilisation 

are controversial because of the ‘spare’ embryos that 
are created and not returned to the uterus. Some 
people believe that since these embryos are potential 
human beings, they should not be destroyed or used 
for research. In some cases the ‘spare’ embryos have 
been frozen and used later if the first transplants did 
not work.

other people, however. It is not known for certain 
what proportion of HIV carriers will eventually 
develop AIDS: perhaps 30–50%, or more.

HIV is transmitted by direct infection of the blood. 

Drug users who share needles contaminated with 
infected blood run a high risk of the disease. It can 
also be transmitted sexually, both between men and 
women and, especially, between homosexual men 
who practise anal intercourse. Prostitutes, who have 
many sexual partners, are at risk of being infected 
if they have sex without using condoms and are, 
therefore, a potential source of HIV to others.

Haemophiliacs have also fallen victim to AIDS. 

Haemophiliacs have to inject themselves with a blood 
product that contains a clotting factor. Before the 
risks were recognised, infected carriers sometimes 
donated blood, which was used to produce the 
clotting factor.

245

8/18/14   9:51 PM

 16  RepRoduction

Babies born to HIV carriers may become infected 

with HIV, either in the uterus or during birth or 
from the mother’s milk. The rate of infection varies 
from about 40% in parts of Africa to 14% in Europe. 
If the mother is given drug therapy during labour and 
the baby within 3 days, this method of transmission is 
reduced.

There is no evidence to suggest that the disease can 
be passed on by droplets (Chapter 10), by saliva or by 
normal everyday contact.

When AIDS fi rst appeared, there were no effective 

drugs. Today, there is a range of drugs that can be 
given separately or as a ‘cocktail’, which slow the 
progress of the disease. Research to fi nd a vaccine and 
more effective drugs is ongoing.

There is a range of blood tests designed to detect 

HIV infection. These tests do not detect the virus 
but do indicate whether antibodies to the virus are in 
the blood. If HIV antibodies are present, the person 
is said to be HIV positive. The tests vary in their 
reliability and some are too expensive for widespread 
use. The American Food and Drug Administration 
claims a 99.8% accuracy, but this fi gure is disputed.

Control of the spread of STIs
The best way to avoid sexually transmitted infections 
is to avoid having sexual intercourse with an infected 
person. However, the symptoms of the disease are 
often not obvious and it is diffi cult to recognise an 
infected individual. So the disease is avoided by not 
having sexual intercourse with a person who might 
have the disease. Such persons are:
●  prostitutes who offer sexual intercourse for money
●  people who are known to have had sexual 

relationships with many others

●  casual acquaintances whose background and past 

sexual activities are not known.

Questions
Core
1  Plants can often be propagated from stems but rarely from 
roots. What features of shoots account for this difference?

2  The plants that survive a heath fi re are often those that have 

a rhizome (e.g. ferns). Suggest a reason why this is so.

3  Working from outside to inside, list the parts of a bisexual 

fl ower.

4  What features of fl owers might attract insects?
5  Which part of a fl ower becomes:

a  the seed
b  the fruit?

246

These are good reasons, among many others, for 
being faithful to one partner.

The risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease 
can be greatly reduced if the man uses a condom or 
if a woman uses a femidom. These act as barriers to 
bacteria or viruses.

If a person suspects that he or she has caught 

a sexually transmitted disease, treatment must 
be sought at once. Information about treatment 
can be obtained by phoning one of the numbers 
listed under ‘Venereal Disease’ or ‘Health 
Information Service’ in the telephone directory. 
Treatment is always confi dential. The patients 
must, however, ensure that anyone they have had 
sexual contact with also gets treatment. There is no 
point in one partner being cured if the other is still 
infected.

STIs that are caused by a bacterium, such as 

syphilis and gonorrhoea, can be treated with 
antibiotics if the symptoms are recognised early 
enough. However, HIV is viral so antibiotics are not 
effective. 

The effects of HIV on the immune 
system
HIV attacks certain kinds of lymphocyte (see 
‘Blood’ in Chapter 9), so the number of these 
cells in the body decreases. Lymphocytes produce 
antibodies against infections. If the body cannot 
respond to infections through the immune system, 
it becomes vulnerable to pathogens that might not 
otherwise be life-threatening. As a result, the patient 
has little or no resistance to a wide range of diseases 
such as infl uenza, pneumonia, blood disorders, skin 
cancer or damage to the nervous system, which the 
body cannot resist.

Checklist
After studying Chapter 16 you should know and understand the 
following:

Asexual reproduction

•  Asexual reproduction is the process resulting in the 

production of genetically identical offspring from one parent.
•  Asexual reproduction occurs without gametes or fertilisation.
•  Fungi can reproduce asexually by single-celled spores.
•  Many flowering plants reproduce asexually by vegetative 

propagation.

•  Plants reproduce asexually when some of their buds grow 

into new plants.

•  The stolon of the strawberry plant is a horizontal stem 

that grows above the ground, takes root at the nodes and 
produces new plants.

•  The couch grass rhizome is a horizontal stem that grows 

below the ground and sends up shoots from its nodes.

•  Bulbs are condensed shoots with circular fleshy leaves. Bulb-

forming plants reproduce asexually from lateral buds.

•  Rhizomes, corms, bulbs and tap roots may store food, which 

is used to accelerate early growth.

•  A clone is a population of organisms produced asexually from 

a single parent.

Sexual reproduction in plants

•  Flowers contain the reproductive organs of plants.
•  The stamens are the male organs. They produce pollen 

grains, which contain the male gamete.

•  The carpels are the female organs. They produce ovules, 

which contain the female gamete and will form the seeds.
•  The flowers of most plant species contain male and female 

organs. A few species have unisexual flowers.

•  Brightly coloured petals attract insects, which pollinate the 

flower.

•  Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anthers of one 

flower to the stigma of a flower on the same or another 
plant.

•  Pollination may be carried out by insects or by the wind.
•  Flowers that are pollinated by insects are usually brightly 

coloured and have nectar. 

•  Flowers that are pollinated by the wind are usually small and 

green. Their stigmas and anthers hang outside the flower 
where they are exposed to air movements.

•  Fertilisation occurs when a pollen tube grows from a pollen 
grain into the ovary and up to an ovule. The pollen nucleus 
passes down the tube and fuses with the ovule nucleus.

•  After fertilisation, the ovary grows rapidly to become a fruit 

and the ovules become seeds.

•  Whole plants can be produced from single cells or small 

•  Germination is influenced by temperature and the amount of 

pieces of tissue.

water and oxygen available.

•  Artificial propagation from cuttings or grafts preserves the 

desirable characteristics of a crop plant.

•  Vegetative propagation produces (genetically) identical 

individuals.

•  Asexual reproduction keeps the characteristics of the 

organism the same from one generation to the next, but 
does not result in variation to cope with environmental 
change.

Sexual reproduction

•  Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of the 

nuclei of two gametes (sex cells) to form a zygote and the 
production of offspring that are genetically different from 
each other.

•  The male gamete is small and mobile. The female gamete is 

larger and not often mobile.

•  The male gamete of an animal is a sperm. The male gamete 

of a flowering plant is the pollen nucleus.

•  The female gamete of an animal is an ovum. The female 

gamete of a flowering plant is an egg cell in an ovule.

•  Fertilisation is the fusion of gamete nuclei.

•  The nuclei of gametes are haploid and the nucleus of the 

zygote is diploid.

•  There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual 

reproduction to a species.

•  There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual 

reproduction in crop production.

•  Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the 

anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.
•  Cross-pollination is transfer of pollen grains from the 

anther of a flower to the stigma of a flower on a different 
plant of the same species.

•  Self-pollination and cross-pollination have implications to 

a species.

Sexual reproduction in humans

•  The male reproductive cells (gametes) are sperm. They are 

produced in the testes and expelled through the urethra and 
penis during mating.

•  The female reproductive cells (gametes) are ova (eggs). They 
are produced in the ovaries. One is released each month. If 
sperm are present, the ovum may be fertilised as it passes 
down the oviduct to the uterus.

•  Fertilisation happens when a sperm enters an ovum and the 

sperm and egg nuclei join up (fuse).

•  The fertilised ovum (zygote) divides into many cells and 

becomes embedded in the lining of the uterus. Here it grows 
into an embryo.

•  The embryo gets its food and oxygen from its mother.
•  The embryo’s blood is pumped through blood vessels in 
the umbilical cord to the placenta, which is attached to 
the uterus lining. The embryo’s blood comes very close to 
the mother’s blood so that food and oxygen can be picked 
up and carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste can be 
got rid of.

Sexually transmitted infections (Stis)

•  Good ante-natal care, in the form of special dietary needs

and maintaining good health, is needed to support the 
mother and her fetus.

•  When the embryo is fully grown, it is pushed out of the 

uterus through the vagina by contractions of the uterus and 
abdomen.

•  Twins may result from two ova being fertilised at the same 

time or from a zygote forming two embryos.

•  There are effective ways of spacing births and limiting the

•  Sperm and eggs have special features to adapt them for 

their functions.

•  The placenta and umbilical cord are involved in exchange 
of materials between the mother and fetus. Some toxins 
and viruses can also be passed across and affect the fetus.

•  Human milk and breastfeeding are best for babies.

Sex hormones in humans

•  At puberty, the testes and ovaries start to produce mature 
gametes and the secondary sexual characteristics develop.
•  Each month, the uterus lining thickens up in readiness to 
receive a fertilised ovum. If an ovum is not fertilised, the 
lining and some blood are lost through the vagina. This is 
menstruation.

•  Oestrogen and progesterone are secreted by endocrine 

glands.

•  The release of ova and the development of an embryo 

are under the control of hormones like oestrogen, 
progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising 
hormone.

•  Male infertility can be by-passed by artificial insemination.
•  There are social implications of using hormones in 

contraception and for increasing the chances of 
pregnancy.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

•  A sexually transmitted infection is an infection transmitted via 

bodily fluids through sexual contact.

•  HIV is an example of an STI.
•  HIV can be transmitted in a number of ways.
•  The spread of HIV can be controlled.
•  HIV infection may lead to AIDS. 

•  HIV affects the immune system by reducing the number 

of lymphocytes and decreasing the ability to produce 
antibodies.

Key defi nition
Inheritance is the transmission of genetic information from 

generation to generation.

We often talk about people inheriting certain 
characteristics: ‘Nathan has inherited his father’s curly 
hair’, or ‘Fatima has inherited her mother’s brown 
eyes’. We expect tall parents to have tall children. The 
inheritance of such characteristics is called heredity 
and the branch of biology that studies how heredity 
works is called genetics.

●● Chromosomes, genes

Key defi nitions
A chromosome is a thread of DNA, made up of a string of 

genes. 

A gene is a length of DNA that codes for a protein.

Inside a nucleus are thread-like structures called 
chromosomes which can be seen most clearly at the 
time when the cell is dividing. Each chromosome 
has certain characteristics when ready to divide: there 
are two chromatids, joined at one point called a 
centromere (Figure 17.1). Each chromatid is a string of 
genes, coding for the person’s characteristics. The other 
chromatid carries the same genes in the same order.

Figure 17.1  Structure of a chromosome

A human body (somatic) cell nucleus contains 
46 chromosomes. These are diffi cult to distinguish 
when packed inside the nucleus, so scientists separate 
them and arrange them according to size and 
appearance. The outcome is called a karyotype 
(Figure 17.2). There are pairs of chromosomes. The 
only pair that do not necessarily match is chromosome 
pair 23: the ‘sex chromosomes’. The Y chromosome is 
much smaller than the X chromosome.
The inheritance of sex
Whether you are a male or female depends on the 
pair of chromosomes called the ‘sex chromosomes’. 
In females, the two sex chromosomes, called 
the X chromosomes, are the same size as each 
other. In males, the two sex chromosomes are of 
different sizes. One corresponds to the female sex

(Figure 17.3). If an X sperm fertilises the ovum, the 
zygote will be XX and will grow into a girl. If a Y 
sperm fertilises the ovum, the zygote will be XY and 
will develop into a boy. There is an equal chance of 
an X or Y chromosome fertilising an ovum, so the 
numbers of girl and boy babies are more or less the 
same.

other is smaller and is called the Y chromosome. So  
the female cells contain XX and male cells contain XY. 
A process called meiosis takes place in the female’s 
ovary. It makes gametes: sex cells, which have half the 
normal number of chromosomes. During the process, 
each ovum receives one of the X chromosomes, 
so all the ova are the same for this. Meiosis in the

The genetic code
The structure of DNA has already been described in 
Chapter 4. 

Each nucleotide carries one of four bases (A, T, 

C or G). A string of nucleotides therefore holds 
a sequence of bases. This sequence forms a code, 
which instructs the cell to make particular proteins. 
Proteins are made from amino acids linked together 
(Chapter 4). The type and sequence of the amino 
acids joined together will determine the kind of 
protein formed. For example, one protein molecule 
may start with the sequence alanine–glycine–glycine 
.... A different protein may start glycine–serine–
alanine ....

It is the sequence of bases in the DNA molecule 

that decides which amino acids are used and in 
which order they are joined. Each group of three 
bases stands for one amino acid, e.g. the triplet of 
bases CGA specifies the amino acid alanine, the 
base triplet CAT specifies the amino acid valine, and 
the triplet CCA stands for glycine. The tri-peptide 
valine–glycine–alanine is specified by the DNA code 
CAT–CCA–CGA (Figure 17.5).

A gene, then, is a sequence of triplets of the four 
bases, which specifies an entire protein. Insulin is a 
small protein with only 51 amino acids. A sequence 
of 153 (i.e. 3 × 51) bases in the DNA molecule 
would constitute the gene that makes an islet cell 
in the pancreas produce insulin. Most proteins are 
much larger than this and most genes contain a 
thousand or more bases.

The DNA base sequence . . . determines . . . the sequence of amino

acids in a peptide

The chemical reactions that take place in a cell 
determine what sort of a cell it is and what its 
functions are. These chemical reactions are, in turn, 
controlled by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins. It 
follows, therefore, that the genetic code of DNA, in 
determining which proteins, particularly enzymes, 
are produced in a cell, also determines the cell’s 
structure and function. In this way, the genes also 
determine the structure and function of the whole 
organism.

Other proteins coded for in DNA include 

antibodies and the receptors for neurotransmitters 
(see details of synapses in Chapter 14).

The manufacture of proteins 
in cells
DNA molecules remain in the nucleus, but the 
proteins they carry the codes for are needed 
elsewhere in the cell. A molecule called messenger 
RNA (mRNA) is used to transfer the information 
from the nucleus. It is much smaller than a DNA 
molecule and is made up of only one strand. Another 
difference is that mRNA molecules contain slightly 
different bases (A, C, G and U). Base U is uracil. It 
attaches to the DNA base A.

To pass on the protein code, the double helix 
of DNA (see Figure 4.12) unwinds to expose the 
chain of bases. One strand acts as template. A 
messenger RNA molecule is formed along part 
of this strand, made up of a chain of nucleotides 
with complementary bases to a section of the DNA 
strand (Figure 17.6). The mRNA molecule carrying 
the protein code then passes out of the nucleus, 
through a nuclear pore in the membrane. Once 
in the cytoplasm it attaches itself to a ribosome. 
Ribosomes make proteins. The mRNA molecule 
instructs the ribosome to put together a chain of 
amino acids in a specific sequence, thus making a 
protein. Other mRNA molecules will carry codes for 
different proteins. 

Some proteins are made up of a relatively small 

number of amino acids. As stated, insulin is a chain 
of 51 amino acids. On the mRNA molecule each 
amino acid is coded by a sequence of three bases (a 
triplet), so the mRNA molecule coding for insulin 
will contain 153 bases. Other protein molecules are 
much bigger: haemoglobin in red blood cells is made 
of 574 amino acids.

Gene expression
Body cells do not all have the same requirements 
for proteins. For example, the function of some cells 
in the stomach is to make the protein pepsin (see 
‘Chemical digestion’ in Chapter 7). Bone marrow 
cells make the protein haemoglobin, but do not 
need digestive enzymes. Specialised cells all contain 
the same genes in their nuclei, but only the genes 
needed to code for specific proteins are switched on 
(expressed). This enables the cell to make only the 
proteins it needs to fulfil its function.

Key definitions
A haploid nucleus is a nucleus containing a single set of 

unpaired chromosomes present, for example, in sperm 
and egg cells.

A diploid nucleus is a nucleus containing two sets of 
chromosomes present, for example, in body cells.

Number of chromosomes
Figure 17.2 is a karyotype of a human body cell 
because there are 23 pairs of chromosomes present 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_17.indd   253

Chromosomes, genes and proteins

(they come from a diploid cell). Because the 
chromosomes are in pairs, the diploid number is 
always an even number. The karyotype of a sperm cell 
would show 23 single chromosomes (they come from 
a haploid cell). The sex chromosome would be either 
X or Y. The chromosomes have different shapes and 
sizes and can be recognised by a trained observer.

There is a fixed number of chromosomes in  
each species. Human body cells each contain  
46 chromosomes, mouse cells contain 40 and garden 
pea cells 14 (see also Figure 17.7).

The number of chromosomes in a species is  

the same in all of its body cells. There are  
46 chromosomes in each of your liver cells, in every 
nerve cell, skin cell and so on.

The chromosomes are always in pairs 

(Figure 17.7), e.g. two long ones, two short ones, 
two medium ones. This is because when the zygote 
is formed, one of each pair comes from the male 
gamete and one from the female gamete. Your  
46 chromosomes consist of 23 from your mother 
and 23 from your father.

The chromosomes of each pair are called 

homologous chromosomes. In Figure 17.18(b), the 
two long chromosomes form one homologous pair 
and the two short chromosomes form another.

●● Mitosis

Key defi nitions
Mitosis is nuclear division giving rise to genetically 

identical cells.

Genetics is the study of inheritance. It can be used 
to forecast what sorts of offspring are likely to be 
produced when plants or animals reproduce sexually. 
What will be the eye colour of children whose mother 
has blue eyes and whose father has brown eyes? Will 
a mating between a black mouse and a white mouse 
produce grey mice, black-and-white mice or some 
black and some white mice?

To understand the method of inheritance, 
we need to look once again at the process of 
sexual reproduction and fertilisation. In sexual 
reproduction, a new organism starts life as a single 
cell called a zygote (Chapter 16). This means that 
you started from a single cell. Although you were 
supplied with oxygen and food in the uterus, all 
your tissues and organs were produced by cell 
division from this one cell. So, the ‘instructions’ 
that dictated which cells were to become liver 
or muscle or bone must all have been present 
in this fi rst cell. The instructions that decided 
that you should be tall or short, dark or fair, male 
or female must also have been present in the 
zygote.

The process of mitosis is important in growth. 

We all started off as a single cell (a zygote). That cell 
divided into two cells, then four and so on, to create 
the organism we are now, made up of millions of 
cells. Cells have a fi nite life: they wear out or become 
damaged, so they need to be replaced constantly. 
The processes of growth, repair and replacement 
of cells all rely on mitosis. Organisms that reproduce 
asexually (see Chapter 16) also use mitosis to create 
more cells.

Cell division
When plants and animals grow, their cells increase 
in number by dividing. Typical growing regions are 
the ends of bones, layers of cells in the skin, root 
tips and buds (Figure 17.11). Each cell divides to 
produce two daughter cells. Both daughter cells may 
divide again, but usually one of the cells grows and 
changes its shape and structure and becomes adapted 
to do one particular job – in other words, it becomes 
specialised (Figure 17.8). At the same time it loses 
its ability to divide any more. The other cell is still 
able to divide and so continue the growth of the 
tissue. Growth is, therefore, the result of cell division, 
followed by cell enlargement and, in many cases, cell 
specialisation.

to divide are sometimes called stem cells.

The process of cell division in an animal cell is 
shown in Figure 17.9. The events in a plant cell 
are shown in Figures 17.10 and 17.11. Because of 
the cell wall, the cytoplasm cannot simply pinch off 
in the middle, and a new wall has to be laid down 
between the two daughter cells. Also a new vacuole 
has to form.

Organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts 
are able to divide and are shared more or less equally 
between the daughter cells at cell division.

Making the squash preparation

■  Squash the softened, stained root tips by lightly tapping on the 

coverslip with a pencil: hold the pencil vertically and let it slip 
through the fi ngers to strike the coverslip (Figure 17.12). 

■  The root tip will spread out as a pink mass on the slide; 

the cells will separate and the nuclei, many of them with 
chromosomes in various stages of mitosis (because the root tip 
is a region of rapid cell division), can be seen under the high 
power of the microscope (×400).

■  Cover the root tips with nine drops acetic orcein and one drop 

molar hydrochloric acid.

■  Heat the watch glass gently over a very small Bunsen fl ame till 

the steam rises from the stain, but do not boil.

■  Leave the watch glass covered for at least 5 minutes.
■  Place one of the root tips on a clean slide, cover with 45%

●● Meiosis

Key defi nitions
Meiosis is nuclear division, which gives rise to cells that are 

genetically different.

The process of meiosis takes place in the gonads 
of animals (e.g. the testes and ovaries of mammals, 
and the anthers and ovules of fl owering plants). 
The cells formed are gametes (sperm and egg cells 
in mammals; egg cells and pollen grain nuclei in 
fl owering plants). Gametes are different from other 
cells because they have half the normal number of 
chromosomes (they are haploid).

The process of mitosis
To understand how the ‘instructions’ are passed 
from cell to cell, we need to look in more detail at 
what happens when the zygote divides and produces 
an organism consisting of thousands of cells. This 
type of cell division is called mitosis. It takes place 
not only in a zygote but in all growing tissues.

When a cell is not dividing, there is very little 

detailed structure to be seen in the nucleus even if it 
is treated with special dyes called stains. Just before 
cell division, however, a number of long, thread-like 
structures appear in the nucleus and show up very 
clearly when the nucleus is stained (Figures 17.13 
and 17.14). These thread-like structures are called 
chromosomes. Although they are present in the 
nucleus all the time, they show up clearly only at cell 
division because at this time they get shorter and 
thicker.

Each chromosome duplicates itself and is seen 

to be made up of two parallel strands, called 
chromatids (Figure 17.1). When the nucleus 
divides into two, one chromatid from each 
chromosome goes into each daughter nucleus. 
The chromatids in each nucleus now become 
chromosomes and later they will make copies of 
themselves ready for the next cell division. The 
process of copying is called replication because 
each chromosome makes a replica (an exact copy) 
of itself. As Figure 17.13 is a simplifi ed diagram 
of mitosis, only two chromosomes are shown, 
but there are always more than this. Human cells 
contain 46 chromosomes.

Mitosis will be taking place in any part of a plant 
or animal that is producing new cells for growth or 
replacement. Bone marrow produces new blood 
cells by mitosis; the epidermal cells of the skin are 
replaced by mitotic divisions in the basal layer; 
new epithelial cells lining the alimentary canal are 
produced by mitosis; growth of muscle or bone in 
animals, and root, leaf, stem or fruit in plants, results 
from mitotic cell divisions.

An exception to this occurs in the fi nal stages of 
gamete production in the reproductive organs of 
plants and animals. The cell divisions that give rise to 
gametes are not mitotic but meiotic.

Cells that are not involved in the production of 

gametes are called somatic cells. Mitosis takes place 
only in somatic cells.

Figure 17.16  Replication. (A, B, C, etc. represent genes.)

Which of the instructions are used depends on where 
a cell finally ends up. The gene that causes brown 
eyes will have no effect in a stomach cell and the 
gene for making pepsin will not function in the cells 
of the eye. So a gene’s chemical instructions are 
carried out only in the correct situation.

The genes that produce a specific effect in a cell 

(or whole organism) are said to be expressed. In the 
stomach lining, the gene for pepsin is expressed. The 
gene for melanin (the pigment in brown eyes) is not 
expressed.

Stem cells
Recent developments in tissue culture have involved 
stem cells. Stem cells are those cells in the body that 
have retained their power of division. Examples are 
the basal cells of the skin (‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 
14), which keep dividing to make new skin cells, and 
cells in the red bone marrow, which constantly divide 
to produce the whole range of blood cells (‘Blood’ 
in Chapter 9).

In normal circumstances this type of stem cell can 

produce only one type of tissue: epidermis, blood, 
muscle, nerves, etc. Even so, culture of these stem 
cells could lead to effective therapies by introducing 
healthy stem cells into the body to take over the 
function of diseased or defective cells.

Cells taken from early embryos (embryonic 

stem cells) can be induced to develop into almost 
any kind of cell, but there are ethical objections to 
using human embryos for this purpose. However, 
it has recently been shown that, given the right

described in Figure 17.13. (The tissue has been squashed to separate 
the cells.)

The function of chromosomes
When a cell is not dividing, its chromosomes 
become very long and thin. Along the length of 
the chromosome is a series of chemical structures 
called genes (Figure 17.15). The chemical that 
forms the genes is called DNA (which is short 
for deoxyribonucleic acid, Chapter 4). Each gene 
controls some part of the chemistry of the cell. It is 
these genes that provide the ‘instructions’ mentioned 
at the beginning of the chapter. For example, one 
gene may ‘instruct’ the cell to make the pigment 
that is formed in the iris of brown eyes. On one 
chromosome there will be a gene that causes the cells 
of the stomach to make the enzyme pepsin. When 
the chromosome replicates, it builds an exact replica 
of itself, gene by gene (Figure 17.16). When the 
chromatids separate at mitosis, each cell will receive a 
full set of genes. In this way, the chemical instructions 
in the zygote are passed on to all cells of the body. All 
the chromosomes, all the genes and, therefore, all the 
instructions are faithfully reproduced by mitosis and 
passed on complete to all the cells.

conditions, brain stem cells can become muscle or 
blood cells, and liver cells have been cultured from 
blood stem cells. Scientists have also succeeded in 
reprogramming skin cells to develop into other 
types of cell, such as nerve cells. Bone marrow cells 
are used routinely to treat patients with leukaemia 
(cancer of white blood cells). The use of adult 
stem cells does not have the ethical problems of 
embryonic stem cells, since cells that could become 
whole organisms are not being destroyed.

Gamete production and 
chromosomes
The genes on the chromosomes carry the instructions 
that turn a single-cell zygote into a bird or a rabbit 
or an oak tree. The zygote is formed at fertilisation, 
when a male gamete fuses with a female gamete. Each 
gamete brings a set of chromosomes to the zygote. 
The gametes, therefore, must each contain only half 
the diploid number of chromosomes, otherwise the 
chromosome number would double each time an 
organism reproduced sexually. Each human sperm cell 
contains 23 chromosomes and each human ovum has 
23 chromosomes. When the sperm and ovum fuse at 
fertilisation (Chapter 16), the diploid number of 46 
(23 + 23) chromosomes is produced (Figure 17.17).

The process of cell division that gives rise to 

gametes is different from mitosis because it results 
in the cells containing only half the diploid number 
of chromosomes. This number is called the haploid 
number and the process of cell division that gives rise 
to gametes is called meiosis.

Meiosis takes place only in reproductive organs.

Meiosis
In a diploid cell that is going to divide and produce 
gametes, the chromosomes shorten and thicken as in 
mitosis. The pairs of homologous chromosomes, 
e.g. the two long ones and the two short ones in 
Figure 17.18(b), lie alongside each other and,  when 
the nucleus divides for the first time, it is the 
chromosomes and not the chromatids that are 
separated. This results in only half the total number 
of chromosomes going to each daughter cell. In 
Figure 17.18(c), the diploid number of four 
chromosomes is being reduced to two chromosomes 
prior to the first cell division.

Figure 17.17  Chromosomes in gamete production and fertilisation
By now (Figure 17.18(d)), each chromosome is seen 
to consist of two chromatids and there is a second 
division of the nucleus (Figure 17.18(e)), which 
separates the chromatids into four distinct nuclei 
(Figure 17.18(f)).

This gives rise to four gametes, each with the 

haploid number of chromosomes. In the anther of 
a plant (Chapter 16), four haploid pollen grains 
are produced when a pollen mother cell divides by 
meiosis (Figure 17.19). In the testis of an animal, 
meiosis of each sperm-producing cell forms four 
sperm. In the cells of the ovule of a flowering 
plant or the ovary of a mammal, meiosis gives rise 
to only one mature female gamete. Four gametes 
may be produced initially, but only one of them 
turns into an egg cell that can be fertilised.
As a result of meiosis and fertilisation, the 
maternal and paternal chromosomes meet in 
different combinations in the zygotes. Consequently, 
the offspring will differ from their parents and from 
each other in a variety of ways.

Asexually produced organisms (Chapter 16) show 

no such variation because they are produced by 
mitosis and all their cells are identical to those of 
their single parent.

●● Monohybrid inheritance

Key definitions
An allele is a version of a gene.
Genotype is the genetic make-up of an organism in terms of 

the alleles present.

Phenotype is the features of an organism.
Homozygous means having two identical alleles of a 

particular gene e.g. TT, where T is tall. Note that two 
identical homozygous individuals that breed together will 
be pure-breeding.

Heterozygous means having two different alleles of a 
particular gene e.g. Tt. Note that a heterozygous 
individual will not be pure breeding.

An allele that is expressed if it is present is dominant.
An allele that is only expressed when there is no dominant 

allele of the gene present is recessive.

Alleles
The genes that occupy corresponding positions on 
homologous chromosomes and control the same 
characteristic are called allelomorphic genes, or 
alleles. The word ‘allelomorph ’ means ‘alternative 
form’.  For example, there are two alternative forms 
of a gene for eye colour. One allele produces brown 
eyes and one allele produces blue eyes. 

There are often more than two alleles of a gene. 
The human ABO blood groups are controlled by 
three alleles, though only two of these can be present 
in one genotype.
Patterns of inheritance
A knowledge of mitosis and meiosis allows us to 
explain, at least to some extent, how heredity works. 
The allele in a mother’s body cells that causes her 
to have brown eyes may be present on one of the 
chromosomes in each ovum she produces. If the 
father’s sperm cell contains an allele for brown eyes 
on the corresponding chromosome, the zygote will 
receive an allele for brown eyes from each parent. 
These alleles will be reproduced by mitosis in all the 
embryo’s body cells and when the embryo’s eyes 
develop, the alleles will make the cells of the iris 
produce brown pigment (melanin) and the child 
will have brown eyes. In a similar way, the child may 
receive alleles for curly hair. 

Figure 17.20 shows this happening, but it does 

not, of course, show all the other chromosomes with 
thousands of genes for producing the enzymes, making 
different types of cell and all the other processes that 
control the development of the organism.

Single-factor inheritance
Because it is impossible to follow the inheritance 
of the thousands of characteristics controlled by 
genes, it is usual to start with the study of a single 
gene that controls one characteristic. We have used 
eye colour as an example so far. Probably more 
than one allele pair is involved, but the simplified 
example will serve our purpose. It has already 
been explained how an allele for brown eyes from 
each parent results in the child having brown eyes. 
Suppose, however, that the mother has blue eyes 
and the father brown eyes. The child might receive 
an allele for blue eyes from its mother and an allele 
for brown eyes from its father (Figure 17.21). If this 
happens, the child will, in fact, have brown eyes. 
The allele for brown eyes is said to be dominant 
to the allele for blue eyes. Although the allele for 
blue eyes is present in all the child’s cells, it is not 
expressed. It is said to be recessive to brown. 
Eye colour is a useful ‘model’ for explaining 

inheritance but it is not wholly reliable because ‘blue’ 
eyes vary in colour and sometimes contain small 
amounts of brown pigment.

zygote

Figure 17.21  Combination of alleles in the zygote (only one 
chromosome is shown). The zygote has both alleles for eye colour; 
the child will have brown eyes.
This example illustrates the following important 
points:
●  There is a pair of alleles for each characteristic, one 

allele from each parent.

●  Although the allele pairs control the same 

characteristic, e.g. eye colour, they may have 
different effects. One tries to produce blue eyes, 
the other tries to produce brown eyes.

●  Often one allele is dominant over the other.

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_17.indd   260

8/18/14   9:54 PM

●  The alleles of each pair are on corresponding 

chromosomes and occupy corresponding positions. 
For example, in Figure 17.20 the alleles for eye 
colour are shown in the corresponding position on 
the two short chromosomes and the alleles for hair 
curliness are in corresponding positions on the two 
long chromosomes. In diagrams and explanations 
of heredity:
●  alleles are represented by letters
●  alleles controlling the same characteristic are 

given the same letter, and

●  the dominant allele is given the capital letter.

For example, in rabbits, the dominant allele for black 
fur is labelled B. The recessive allele for white fur 
is labelled b to show that it corresponds to B for 
black fur. If it were labelled w, we would not see any 
connection between B and w. B and b are obvious 
partners. In the same way L could represent the allele 
for long fur and l the allele for short fur.
Breeding true
A white rabbit must have both the recessive alleles 
b and b. If it had B and b, the dominant allele for 
black (B) would override the allele for white (b) and 
produce a black rabbit. A black rabbit, on the other 
hand, could be either BB or Bb and, by just looking 
at the rabbit, you could not tell the difference. When 
a male black rabbit BB produces sperm, each one of 
the pair of chromosomes carrying the B alleles will 
end up in different sperm cells. Since the alleles are 
the same, all the sperm will have the B allele for black 
fur (Figure 17.22(a)).

A black rabbit BB is called a true-breeding black and is 

said to be homozygous for black coat colour (‘homo-’  
means ‘the same’). If this rabbit mates with another 
black (BB) rabbit, all the babies will be black because all 
will receive a dominant allele for black fur. When all the 
offspring have the same characteristic as the parents, this 
is called ‘breeding true’ for this characteristic.

When a Bb black rabbit produces gametes by 
meiosis, the chromosomes with the B allele and 
the chromosomes with the b allele will end up 
in different gametes. So 50% of the sperm cells 
will carry B alleles and 50% will carry b alleles 
(Figure 17.22(b)). Similarly, in the female, 50% of the 
ova will have a B allele and 50% will have a b allele. If 
a b sperm fertilises a b ovum, the offspring, with two 
b alleles (bb), will be white. The black Bb rabbits are 

Monohybrid inheritance

not true-breeding because they may produce some 
white babies as well as black ones. The Bb rabbits are 
called heterozygous (‘hetero-’ means ‘different’).

The black BB rabbits are homozygous dominant.
The white bb rabbits are homozygous recessive.

Genotype and phenotype
The two kinds of black rabbit BB and Bb are said to 
have the same phenotype. This is because their coat 
colours look exactly the same. However, because they 
have different allele pairs for coat colour they are said to 
have different genotypes, i.e. different combinations of 
alleles. One genotype is BB and the other is Bb.

You and your brother might both be brown-eyed 
phenotypes but your genotype could be BB and his 
could be Bb. You would be homozygous dominant for 
brown eyes; he would be heterozygous for eye colour.
The three to one ratio
The result of a mating between a true-breeding 
(homozygous) black mouse (BB) and a true-breeding 
(homozygous) brown mouse (bb) is shown in 
Figure 17.23(a). The illustration is greatly simplified 
because it shows only one pair of the 20 pairs of 
mouse chromosomes and only one pair of alleles on 
the chromosomes.

Because black is dominant to brown, all the 

offspring from this mating will be black phenotypes, 
because they all receive the dominant allele for black 
fur from the father. Their genotypes, however, will be 
Bb because they all receive the recessive b allele from 
the mother. They are heterozygous for coat colour. 
The offspring resulting from this first mating are 
called the F1 generation.

Figure 17.23(b) shows what happens when these 
heterozygous, F1 black mice are mated together to 
produce what is called the F2 generation. Each sperm 
or ovum produced by meiosis can contain only one of 
the alleles for coat colour, either B or b. So there are 
two kinds of sperm cell, one kind with the B allele and 
one kind with the b allele. There are also two kinds 
of ovum, with either B or b alleles. When fertilisation 
occurs, there is no way of telling whether a b or a B 
sperm will fertilise a B or a b ovum, so we have to 
look at all the possible combinations as follows:
●  A b sperm fertilises a B ovum. Result: bB zygote.
●  A b sperm fertilises a b ovum. Result: bb zygote.
●  A B sperm fertilises a B ovum. Result: BB zygote.
●  A B sperm fertilises a b ovum. Result: Bb zygote.
There is no difference between bB and Bb, so there 
are three possible genotypes in the offspring – BB, 
Bb and bb. There are only two phenotypes – black 
(BB or Bb) and brown (bb). So, according to the 
laws of chance, we would expect three black baby mice 
and one brown. Mice usually have more than four 
offspring and what we really expect is that the ratio 
(proportion) of black to brown will be close to 3:1.
If the mouse had 13 babies, you might expect nine 
black and four brown, or eight black and five brown. 
Even if she had 16 babies you would not expect to find 
exactly 12 black and four brown because whether a B or 
b sperm fertilises a B or b ovum is a matter of chance. If 
you spun ten coins, you would not expect to get exactly 
five heads and five tails. You would not be surprised at 
six heads and four tails or even seven heads and three 
tails. In the same way, we would not be surprised at 14 
black and two brown mice in a litter of 16.

To decide whether there really is a 3:1 ratio, we 
need a lot of results. These may come either from 
breeding the same pair of mice together for a year 
or so to produce many litters, or from mating 20 
black and 20 brown mice, crossing the offspring and 
adding up the number of black and brown babies in 
the F2 families (see also Figure 17.24).

When working out the results of a genetic cross, 

it is useful to display the outcomes in a ‘Punnett 
square’ (Figure 17.25). This a box divided into 
four compartments. The two boxes along the top 
are labelled with the genotypes of the gametes of 
one parent. The genotypes are circled to show they 
are gametes. The parent’s genotype is written above 
the gametes. The boxes down the left-hand side are 
labelled with the genotypes of the gametes of the 

other parent. The parent’s genotype is written to 
the left. The genotypes of the offspring can then be 
predicted by completing the four boxes, as shown. 
In this example, two heterozygous tall organisms 
(Tt) are the parents. The genotypes of the offspring 
are TT, Tt, Tt and tt. We know that the allele T is 
dominant because the parents are tall, although they 
carry both tall and dwarf alleles. So, the phenotypes 
of the offspring will be three tall to one dwarf.

The recessive test-cross (back-cross)
A black mouse could have either the BB or the Bb 
genotype. One way to find out which is to cross the 
black mouse with a known homozygous recessive 
mouse, bb. The bb mouse will produce gametes 
with only the recessive b allele. A black homozygote, 
BB, will produce only B gametes. Thus, if the black 
mouse is BB, all the offspring from the cross will be 
black heterozygotes, Bb.

Half the gametes from a black Bb mouse would 

carry the B allele and half would have the b allele. So, 
if the black mouse is Bb, half of the offspring from 
the cross will, on average, be brown homozygotes, 
bb, and half will be black heterozygotes, Bb.

The term ‘back-cross’ refers to the fact that, in 
effect, the black, mystery mouse is being crossed 
with the same genotype as its brown grandparent, 
the bb mouse in Figure 17.23(a). Mouse ethics and 
speed of reproduction make the use of the actual 
grandparent quite feasible!

effects in an individual (i.e. neither allele is dominant 
to the other) the alleles are said to be co-dominant.
The inheritance of the human ABO blood groups 
provides an example of co-dominance. In the ABO 
system, there are four phenotypic blood groups, A, 
B, AB and O. The alleles for groups A and B are  
co-dominant. If a person inherits alleles for group 
A and group B, his or her red cells will carry both 
antigen A and antigen B.

However, the alleles for groups A and B are both 

completely dominant to the allele for group O. 
(Group O people have neither A nor B antigens on 
their red cells.)

Table 17.2 shows the genotypes and phenotypes 

for the ABO blood groups. (Note that the allele 
for group O is sometimes represented as Io and 
sometimes as i.)

Since the alleles for groups A and B are dominant to 
that for group O, a group A person could have the 
genotype IAIA or IAIo. Similarly a group B person 
could be IBIB or IBIo. There are no alternative 
genotypes for groups AB and O.

 Inheritance of blood group O
Blood group O can be inherited, even though 
neither parent shows this phenotype.

Two parents have the groups A and B. The father 

is IAIo and the mother is IBIo (Figure 17.26).

Inheritance of blood group O

Some plants show co-dominance with regard to 
petal colour. For example, with the gene for flower 
colour in the geranium, the alleles are CR (red) and 
CW (white). The capital letter ‘C’ has been chosen 
to represent colour. Pure breeding (homozygous) 
flowers may be red (CRCR) or white (CWCW). If 
these are cross-pollinated, all the first filial (F1) 
generation will be heterozygous (CRCW) and they 
are pink because both alleles have an effect on the 
phenotype.

Self-pollinating the pink (F1) plants results in an 

unusual ratio in the next (F2) generation of 1 red : 2 
pink : 1 white.

Monohybrid inheritance

One example of this is a form of colour blindness 

(Figure 17.27). In the following case, the mother 
is a carrier of colour blindness (XCXc). This means 
she shows no symptoms of colour blindness, but the 
recessive allele causing colour blindness is present on 
one of her X chromosomes. The father has normal 
colour vision (XCY).

 Incomplete dominance
This term is sometimes taken to mean the same 
as ‘co-dominance’ but, strictly, it applies to a 
case where the effect of the recessive allele is not 
completely masked by the dominant allele.

An example occurs with sickle-cell anaemia (see 

‘Variation’ in Chapter 18). If a person inherits 
both recessive alleles (HbSHbS) for sickle-cell 
haemoglobin, then he or she will exhibit signs of 
the disease, i.e. distortion of the red cells leading to 
severe bouts of anaemia.

A heterozygote (HbAHbS), however, will have 
a condition called ‘sickle-cell trait’. Although there 
may be mild symptoms of anaemia the condition 
is not serious or life-threatening. In this case, the 
normal haemoglobin allele (HbA) is not completely 
dominant over the recessive (HbS) allele.

Sex linkage

Key definitions
A sex-linked characteristic is one in which the gene 

responsible is located on a sex chromosome, which makes 
it more common in one sex than the other.

XcY

The sex chromosomes, X and Y, carry genes that 
control sexual development. In addition they carry 
genes that control other characteristics. These tend to 
be on the X chromosome, which has longer arms to 
the chromatids. Even if the allele is recessive, because 
there is no corresponding allele on the Y chromosome, 
it is bound to be expressed in a male (XY). There is less 
chance of a recessive allele being expressed in a female 
(XX) because the other X chromosome may carry the 
dominant form of the allele.

If the gene responsible for a particular condition is 
present only on the Y chromosome, only males can

possess the Y chromosome.

●● Extension work
Ideas about heredity: Gregor Mendel 
(1822–84)
Mendel was an Augustinian monk from the town 
of Brünn (now Brno) in Czechoslovakia (now the 
Czech Republic). He studied maths and science at the 
University of Vienna in order to teach at a local school.

He was the first scientist to make a systematic 
study of patterns of inheritance involving single 

characteristics. This he did by using varieties of the 
pea plant, Pisum sativum, which he grew in the 
monastery garden. He chose pea plants because they 
were self-pollinating (Chapter 16). Pollen from the 
anthers reached the stigma of the same flower even 
before the flower bud opened.

Mendel selected varieties of pea plant that bore 
distinctive and contrasting characteristics, such as 
green seeds vs yellow seeds, dwarf vs tall, round 
seeds vs wrinkled (Figure 17.28). He used only 
plants that bred true.

Figure 17.28  Some of the characteristics investigated by Mendel

He then crossed pairs of the contrasting varieties. 
To do this he had to open the flower buds, remove 
the stamens and use them to dust pollen on the 
stigmas of the contrasting variety. The offspring of 
this cross he called the ‘first filial’ generation, or F1.
The first thing he noticed was that all the offspring 
of the F1 cross showed the characteristic of only one 
of the parents. For example, tall plants crossed with 
dwarf plants produced only tall plants in the first 
generation.

Next he allowed the plants of the F1 generation 

to self-pollinate and so produce a second filial 
generation, or F2. Surprisingly, the dwarf characteristic 
that had, seemingly, disappeared in the F1 reappeared 
in the F2. This characteristic had not, in fact, been  
lost but merely concealed or suppressed in the F1 
to re-emerge in the F2. Mendel called the repressed 
feature ‘recessive’ and the expressed feature 
‘dominant’.

Also, it must be noted, the plants were all either 
tall or dwarf; there were no intermediates, as might 
be expected if the characteristics blended.

Mendel noticed that pollen from tall plants, 

transferred to the stigmas of short plants, produced 
the same result as transferring pollen from short 
plants to the stigmas of tall plants. This meant that 
male and female gametes contributed equally to the 
observed characteristic.

When Mendel counted the number of contrasting 
offspring in the F2, he found that they occurred in 
the ratio of three dominant to one recessive. For 
example, of 1064 F2 plants from the tall × dwarf 
cross, 787 were tall and 277 dwarf, a ratio of 2.84:1. 
This F2 ratio occurred in all Mendel’s crosses, for 
example:

5474:1850 = 2.96:1
●  round vs wrinkled seeds 
6022:2001 = 3.01:1
●  yellow vs green seeds 
●  green vs yellow pods    
428:152 = 2.82:1
Two-thirds of the dominant tall F2 plants did not 
breed true when self-pollinated but produced the 
3:1 ratio of tall : dwarf. They were therefore similar 
to the plants of the F1 generation.

It is not clear whether Mendel speculated on how 
the characteristics were represented in the gametes 
or how they achieved their effects. At one point he 
wrote of ‘the differentiating elements of the egg 
and pollen cells’, but it is questionable whether he 
envisaged actual structures being responsible.

Similarly, when Mendel wrote ‘exactly similar 

factors must be at work’, he meant that there must 
be similar processes taking place. He does not use 
the term ‘factor’ to imply particles or any entities 
that control heritable characteristics.

His symbols A, Ab and b seem to be shorthand 

for the types of plants he studied: A = true-breeding 
dominant, b = true-breeding recessive and Ab = the 
non-true-breeding ‘hybrid’. The letters represented 
the visible characteristics, whereas today they 
represent the alleles responsible for producing the 
characteristic. For example, Mendel never refers to 
AA or bb so he probably did not appreciate that 
each characteristic is represented twice in the somatic 
cells but only once in the gametes.

When Mendel crossed plants, each carrying 
two contrasting characteristics, he found that 
the characteristics turned up in the offspring 
independently of each other. For example, in a cross 
between a tall plant with green seeds and a dwarf plant 
with yellow seeds, some of the offspring were tall with 
yellow seeds and some dwarf with green seeds.

So, Mendel’s work was descriptive and 

mathematical rather than explanatory. He showed 
that certain characteristics were inherited in a 
predictable way, that the gametes were the vehicles, 
that these characteristics did not blend but retained 
their identity and could be inherited independently 
of each other. He also recognised dominant and 
recessive characteristics and, by ‘hybridisation’, that 
in the presence of the dominant characteristic the 
recessive characteristic, though not expressed, did 
not ‘disappear’.

Mendel published his results in 1866 in 
‘Transactions of the Brünn Natural History 
Society’, which, understandably, did not have a

wide circulation. Only when Mendel’s work was 
rediscovered in 1900 was the importance and 
signifi cance of his fi ndings appreciated.

Mendel’s observations are sometimes summarised 
in the form of ‘Mendel’s laws’, but Mendel did not 
formulate any laws and these are the product of 
modern knowledge of genetics.

Checklist
After studying Chapter 17 you should know and understand the 
following:

•  Inheritance is the transmission of genetic information from 

generation to generation.

•  A diploid nucleus is a nucleus containing two sets of 

chromosomes (e.g. in body cells).

•  In a diploid cell, there is a pair of each type of 

chromosome; in a human diploid cell there are 23 pairs.

Mitosis

Chromosomes, genes and proteins

•  Mitosis is nuclear division giving rise to genetically 

•  A chromosome is a thread of DNA, made up of a string of 

genes.

•  A gene is a length of DNA that codes for a protein.
•  An allele is a version of a gene.
•  Chromosomes are found as thread-like structures in the 

nuclei of all cells.

•  Chromosomes are in pairs; one of each pair comes from the 

male and one from the female parent.

•  Sex, in mammals, is determined by the X and Y 

chromosomes. Males are XY; females are XX.

•  The DNA molecule is coiled along the length of the 

chromosome.

identical cells.

•  Mitosis is important in growth, repair of damaged tissues, 

replacement of cells and in asexual reproduction.

•  Before mitosis, the exact duplication of chromosomes 

occurs.

•  Each species of plant or animal has a fi xed number of 

chromosomes in its cells.

•  When cells divide by mitosis, the chromosomes and genes 

are copied exactly and each new cell gets a full set.

•  Stem cells are unspecialised cells that divide by mitosis to 

produce daughter cells that can become specialised for 
specifi c purposes.

•  A DNA molecule is made up of a double chain of 

Meiosis

nucleotides in the form of a helix.

•  The nucleotide bases in the helix pair up A–T and C–G.
•  Triplets of bases control production of the specifi c amino 

acids that make up a protein.

•  Genes consist of specifi c lengths of DNA.
•  Most genes control the type of enzyme that a cell will make.
•  When proteins are made:

–  the DNA with the genetic code for the protein remains 

in the nucleus

–  mRNA molecules carry a copy of the genetic code to 

the cytoplasm

–  the mRNA passes through ribosomes in the cytoplasm 

and the ribosome puts together amino acids to form 
protein molecules.

•  The specifi c order of amino acids is decided by the 

sequence of bases in the mRNA.

•  All body cells in an organism contain the same genes, but 
many genes in a particular cell are not expressed because 
the cell only makes the specifi c proteins it needs.

•  A haploid nucleus is a nucleus containing a single set of 

unpaired chromosomes (e.g. in sperm and egg cells).

•  Meiosis is reduction division in which the chromosome 

number is halved from diploid to haploid resulting in 
genetically different cells.

•  Gametes are the result of meiosis.
•  At meiosis, only one chromosome of each pair goes into 

the gamete.

•  Meiosis produces variation by forming new combinations 

of maternal and paternal chromosomes.

 

Monohybrid inheritance

•  The genotype of an organism is its genetic make-up.
•  The phenotype of an organism is its features.
•  Homozygous means having two identical alleles of a 

particular gene. Two identical homozygous individuals that 
breed together will be pure-breeding.

•  Heterozygous means having two different alleles of a 

particular gene. A heterozygous individual will therefore not 
be pure-breeding.

•  A dominant allele is one that is expressed if it is present.

Monohybrid inheritance

•  A recessive allele is one that is only expressed when there is 

no dominant allele of the gene present.

•  Genetic diagrams are used to predict the results of 
monohybrid crosses and calculate phenotypic ratios.

•  Punnett squares can be used in crosses to work out and show 

the possible different genotypes.

•  A test-cross is used to identify an unknown genotype, for 
instance to find out if it is pure breeding or heterozygous.

•  In some cases, neither one of a pair of alleles is  

fully dominant over the other. This is called  
co-dominance.

•  The inheritance of ABO blood groups is an example of  

co-dominance.

•  The phenotypes are A, B, AB and O blood groups.
•  The genotypes are IA, IB and Io.
•  A sex-linked characteristic is a characteristic in which the 

gene responsible is located on a sex chromosome. This 
makes it more common in one sex than in the other.

•  Colour blindness is an example of sex linkage.
•  Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the results of 

monohybrid crosses involving co-dominance and sex 
linkage.

Key defi nition
Variation is the differences between individuals of the same 

species.

or she exposes themselves to sunlight. So the tan is a 
result of both inherited and acquired characteristics.

north side, upper branches

south side, upper branches

The term ‘variation’ refers to observable differences 
within a species. All domestic cats belong to the 
same species, i.e. they can all interbreed, but 
there are many variations of size, coat colour, eye 
colour, fur length, etc. Those variations that can be 
inherited are determined by genes. They are genetic 
variations. Phenotypic variations may be brought 
about by genes, but can also be caused by the 
environment, or a combination of both genes and 
the environment.

So, there are variations that are not heritable, but 
determined by factors in the environment. A kitten 
that gets insuffi cient food will not grow to the same 
size as its litter mates. A cat with a skin disease may 
have bald patches in its coat. These conditions are not 
heritable. They are caused by environmental effects. 
Similarly, a fair-skinned person may be able to change 
the colour of his or her skin by exposing it to the Sun, 
so getting a tan. The tan is an acquired characteristic. 
You cannot inherit a suntan. Black skin, on the other 
hand, is an inherited characteristic.

Many features in plants and animals are a mixture of 

north side, lower branches

south side, lower branches

Figure 18.1  Acquired characteristics. These apples have all been picked 
from different parts of the same tree. All the apples have similar genotypes, 
so the differences in size must have been caused by environmental effects.

Discontinuous variation
In discontinuous variation, the variations take the 
form of distinct, alternative phenotypes with no 
intermediates (Figures 18.2 and 18.4). The mice in 
Figure 17.23 are either black or brown; there are no 
intermediates. You are either male or female. Apart 
from a small number of abnormalities, sex is inherited 
in a discontinuous way. Some people can roll their 
tongue into a tube. Others are unable to do it. They 

acquired and inherited characteristics (Figure 18.1). 
For example, some fair-skinned people never go brown 
in the Sun, they only become sunburned. They have 
not inherited the genes for producing the extra brown 
pigment in their skin. A fair-skinned person with the

Discontinuous variation cannot usually be altered by 
the environment. You cannot change your eye colour 
by altering your diet. A genetic dwarf cannot grow 
taller by eating more food. You cannot learn how to 
roll your tongue.

Continuous variation
An example of continuous variation is height. There 
are no distinct categories of height; people are not 
either tall or short. There are all possible intermediates 
between very short and very tall (Figure 18.3).

Figure 18.3  Continuous variation. Heights of 90 000 army recruits. The 
apparent ‘steps’ in the distribution are the result of arbitrarily chosen 
categories, differing in height by 1 cm. But heights do not differ by 
exactly 1 cm. If measurements could be made accurately to the nearest 
millimetre there would be a smooth curve like the one shown in colour.

Variation

There are many characteristics that are difficult 
to classify as either wholly continuous or 
discontinuous variations. Human eye colour has 
already been mentioned. People can be classified 
roughly as having blue eyes or brown eyes, but 
there are also categories described as grey, hazel 
or green. It is likely that there are a small number 
of genes for eye colour and a dominant gene for 
brown eyes, which overrides all the others when 
it is present. Similarly, red hair is a discontinuous 
variation but it is masked by genes for other colours 
and there is a continuous range of hair colour from 
blond to black.

Mutations

Key definition
A mutation is a spontaneous genetic change. Mutation is the 

way new alleles are formed.

Many of the cat coat variations mentioned overleaf 
may have arisen, in the first place, as mutations in 
a wild stock of cats. A recent variant produced by a 
mutation is the ‘rex’ variety, in which the coat has 
curly hairs.

Many of our high-yielding crop plants have 

arisen as a result of mutations in which the whole 
chromosome set has been doubled.

Exposure to mutagens, namely certain chemicals 

and radiation, is known to increase the rate of 
mutation. Some of the substances in tobacco 
smoke, such as tar, are mutagens, which can cause 
cancer.

Ionising radiation from X-rays and radioactive 

compounds, and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, 
can both increase the mutation rate. It is uncertain 
whether there is a minimum dose of radiation 
below which there is negligible risk. It is possible 
that repeated exposure to low doses of radiation 
is as harmful as one exposure to a high dose. It 
has become clear in recent years that, in light-
skinned people, unprotected exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation from the Sun can cause a form of skin 
cancer.

Generally speaking, however, exposure to natural 
and medical sources of radiation carries less risk than 
smoking cigarettes or driving a car, but it is sensible 
to keep exposure to a minimum.

intelligence, are always the result of interaction 
between the genotype and the environment.

Discontinuous variation
Discontinuous variation is under the control of a 
single pair of alleles or a small number of genes. 
An example is human blood groups. These were 
discussed in Chapter 17. 

A person is one of four blood groups: A, B, AB or 

O. There are no groups in between.

New combinations of genes
If a grey cat with long fur is mated with a black cat 
with short fur, the kittens will all be black with short 
fur. If these offspring are mated together, in due 
course the litters may include four varieties: black–
short, black–long, grey–short and grey–long. Two of 
these are different from either of the parents.

groups in Britain. The figures could not be adjusted to fit a  
smooth curve because there are no intermediates.

Continuous variation
Continuous variation is influenced by a combination 
of both genetic and environmental factors. 
Continuously variable characteristics are usually 
controlled by several pairs of alleles. There might be 
five pairs of alleles for height – (Hh), (Tt), (Ll), (Ee) 
and (Gg) – each dominant allele adding 4 cm to your 
height. If you inherited all ten dominant genes (HH, 
TT, etc.) you could be 40 cm taller than a person 
who inherited all ten recessive genes (hh, tt, etc.).

The actual number of genes that control height, 
intelligence, and even the colour of hair and skin, is 
not known.

Continuously variable characteristics are greatly 

influenced by the environment. A person may inherit 
genes for tallness and yet not get enough food to 
grow tall. A plant may have the genes for large fruits 
but not get enough water, minerals or sunlight 
to produce large fruits. Continuous variations in 
human populations, such as height, physique and 

A mutation may occur in a gene or a chromosome. 
In a gene mutation it may be that one or more 
genes are not replicated correctly. A chromosome 
mutation may result from damage to or loss of part 
of a chromosome during mitosis or meiosis, or even 
the gain of an extra chromosome, as in Down’s 
syndrome (see page 273).

An abrupt change in a gene or chromosome is 

likely to result in a defective enzyme and will usually 
disrupt the complex reactions in the cells. Most 
mutations, therefore, are harmful to the organism.

Surprisingly, only about 3% of human DNA 
consists of genes. The rest consists of repeated 
sequences of nucleotides that do not code for 
proteins. This is sometimes called ‘junk DNA’, 
but that term only means that we do not know its 
function. If mutations occur in these non-coding 
sequences they are unlikely to have any effect on the 
organism and are, therefore, described as ‘neutral’.

Rarely, a gene or chromosome mutation produces 

a beneficial effect and this may contribute to the 
success of the organism (see ‘Selection’ later in this 
chapter).

If a mutation occurs in a gamete, it will affect all 

the cells of the individual that develops from the 
zygote. Thus the whole organism will be affected. If 
the mutation occurs in a somatic cell (body cell), it 
will affect only those cells produced, by mitosis, from 
the affected cell.

Thus, a mutation in a gamete may result in a 

genetic disorder, e.g. haemophilia or cystic fibrosis. 
Mutations in somatic cells may give rise to cancers 
by promoting uncontrolled cell division in the

affected tissue. For example, skin cancer results 
from uncontrolled cell division in the basal layer of 
the skin.

A mutation may be as small as the substitution  

of one organic base for another in the DNA 
molecule, or as large as the breakage, loss or gain  
of a chromosome.
 Sickle-cell anaemia
This condition has already been mentioned in 
Chapter 17. A person with sickle-cell disease 
has inherited both recessive alleles (HbSHbS) 
for defective haemoglobin. The distortion and 
destruction of the red cells, which occurs in low 
oxygen concentrations, leads to bouts of severe 
anaemia (Figure 18.5). In many African countries, 
sufferers have a reduced chance of reaching 
reproductive age and having a family. There is thus 
a selection pressure, which tends to remove the 
homozygous recessives from the population. In such 
a case, you might expect the harmful HbS allele 
to be selected out of the population altogether. 
However, the heterozygotes (HbAHbS) have 
virtually no symptoms of anaemia but do have the 
advantage that they are more resistant to malaria 
than the homozygotes HbAHbA. It appears that the 
malaria parasite is unable to invade and reproduce in 
the sickle cells.

The selection pressure of malaria, therefore, 

favours the heterozygotes over the homozygotes 
and the potentially harmful HbS allele is kept in the 
population (Figure 18.6).

When Africans migrate to countries where malaria 

does not occur, the selective advantage of the HbS 
allele is lost and the frequency of this allele in the 
population diminishes.

the red cells become distorted.

With sickle-cell anaemia, the defective haemoglobin 
molecule differs from normal haemoglobin by only one 
amino acid (represented by a sequence of three bases), 
i.e. valine replaces glutamic acid. This could be the 
result of faulty replication at meiosis. When the relevant 
parental chromosome replicated at gamete formation, 
the DNA could have produced the triplet –CAT– 
(which specifies valine) instead of –CTT– (which 
specifies glutamic acid). In this case, a change of just 
one base (from A to T) makes a significant difference 
to the characteristics of the protein (haemoglobin).

 Down’s syndrome
Down’s syndrome is a form of mental and physical 
disability, which results from a chromosome mutation. 
During the process of meiosis which produces an 
ovum, one of the chromosomes (chromosome 21) 
fails to separate from its homologous partner, a 
process known as non-disjunction. As a result, the 
ovum carries 24 chromosomes instead of 23, and 
the resulting zygote has 47 instead of the normal 46 
chromosomes. The risk of having a baby with Down’s 
syndrome increases as the mother gets older.

 Mutations in bacteria
Mutations in bacteria often produce resistance to 
drugs. Bacterial cells reproduce very rapidly, perhaps 
as often as once every 20 minutes. Thus a mutation, 
even if it occurs only rarely, is likely to appear in a 
large population of bacteria. If a population of  
bacteria containing one or two drug-resistant 
mutants is subjected to that particular drug, the  
non-resistant bacteria will be killed but the drug-
resistant mutants survive (see Figure 15.1). Mutant 
genes are inherited in the same way as normal genes, 
so when the surviving mutant bacteria reproduce, all 
their offspring will be resistant to the drug.

Mutations are comparatively rare events; perhaps only 
one in every 100 000 replications results in a mutation. 
Nevertheless they do occur naturally all the time.

●● Adaptive features

Key definition
An adaptive feature is an inherited feature that helps an 
organism to survive and reproduce in its environment.

Adaptation
When biologists say that a plant or animal is adapted 
to its habitat they usually mean that, in the course of 
evolution, changes have occurred in the organism, 
which make it more successful in exploiting its 
habitat, e.g. animals finding and digesting food, 
selecting nest sites or hiding places, or plants 
exploiting limited mineral resources or tolerating 
salinity or drought. It is tempting to assume that 
because we find a plant or animal in a particular 
habitat it must be adapted to its habitat. There is 
some logic in this; if an organism was not adapted 
to its habitat, presumably it would be eliminated 
by natural selection. However, it is best to look for 
positive evidence of adaptation.

Sometimes, just by looking at an organism and 

comparing it with related species, it is possible to make 
reasoned guesses about adaptation. For example, there 
seems little doubt that the long, hair-fringed hind legs 
of a water beetle are adaptations to locomotion in 
water when compared with the corresponding legs of 
a land-living relative (Figure 18.7).

Similarly, in Figure 18.8 it seems reasonable to 
suppose that, compared with the generalised 
mammalian limb, the forelimbs of whales are adapted 
for locomotion in water.

By studying animals which live in extreme habitats, 
it is possible to suggest ways in which they might be 
adapted to these habitats especially if the observations 
are supported by physiological evidence.

The camel
Camels are adapted to survive in a hot, dry and 
sandy environment. Adaptive physical features are 
closable nostrils and long eyelashes, which help 
keep out wind-blown sand (Figure 18.9). Their feet 
are broad and splay out under pressure, so reducing 
the tendency to sink into the sand. Thick fur 
insulates the body against heat gain in the intense 
sunlight.

Physiologically, a camel is able to survive without 

water for 6–8 days. Its stomach has a large water-
holding capacity, though it drinks to replace water 
lost by evaporation rather than in anticipation of 
water deprivation. 

The body temperature of a ‘thirsty’ camel rises to 
as much as 40 °C during the day and falls to about 
35 °C at night. The elevated daytime temperature 
reduces the heat gradient between the body and the 
surroundings, so less heat is absorbed. A camel is able 
to tolerate water loss equivalent to 25% of its body 
weight, compared with humans for whom a 12% loss 
may be fatal. The blood volume and concentration 
are maintained by withdrawing water from the body 
tissues.

The nasal passages are lined with mucus. During 

exhalation, the dry mucus absorbs water vapour. 
During inhalation the now moist mucus adds water 
vapour to the inhaled air. In this way, water is 
conserved.

The role of the camel’s humps in water 

conservation is more complex. The humps contain 
fat and are therefore an important reserve of energy-
giving food. However, when the fat is metabolised 
during respiration, carbon dioxide and water

(metabolic water) are produced. The water enters 
the blood circulation and would normally be lost by 
evaporation from the lungs, but the water-conserving 
nasal mucus will trap at least a proportion of it.

The polar bear
Polar bears live in the Arctic, spending much 
of their time on snow and ice. Several physical 
features contribute to their adaptation to this cold 
environment.

It is a very large bear (Figure 18.10), which 

means that the ratio of its surface area to its volume 
is relatively small. The relatively small surface area 
means that the polar bear loses proportionately less 
heat than its more southerly relatives. Also its ears 
are small, another feature that reduces heat loss 
(Figure 18.11).

It has a thick coat with long, loosely packed coarse 

hairs (guard hairs) and a denser layer of shorter woolly 
hairs forming an insulating layer. The long hairs are 
oily and water-repellent and enable the bear to shake 
off water when it emerges from a spell of swimming.

The principal thermal insulation comes from a 10 cm 
layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin. The thermal 
conductivity of fat is little different from any other 
tissue but it has a limited blood supply. This means 
that very little warm blood circulates close to the 
skin surface.

The hollow hairs of the white fur are thought to 

transmit the Sun’s heat to the black skin below. Black 
is an efficient colour for absorbing heat. The white 
colour is also probably an effective camouflage when 
hunting its prey, mainly seals.

A specific adaptation to walking on snow and ice 
is the heat-exchange arrangement in the limbs. The 
arteries supplying the feet run very close to the veins 
returning blood to the heart. Heat from the arteries 
is transferred to the veins before the blood reaches 
the feet (Figure 18.12). So, little heat is lost from 
the feet but their temperature is maintained above 
freezing point, preventing frost-bite.

Polar bears breed in winter when temperatures 

fall well below zero. However, the pregnant female 
excavates a den in the snow in which to give birth 
and rear her two cubs. In this way the cubs are 
protected from the extreme cold.

The female remains in the den for about 140 days, 
suckling her young on the rich milk, which is formed 
from her fat reserves.

Figure 18.10  The polar bear and the sun bear (from SE Asia). The 
smaller surface area/volume ratio in the polar bear helps conserve heat.

Venus flytrap
Many plants show adaptions as well as animals. 
Insectivorous plants such as the Venus flytrap 
(Figure 18.13) live in habitats where there is often a 
shortage of nitrates for growth. They have developed 
pairs of leaves with tooth-like edges. The leaves have

Other adaptations
Adaptive features of the long-eared bat and the hare 
are illustrated in Figures 18.14 and 18.15.

Figure 18.14  Long-eared bat. The bat gives out high-pitched sounds, 
which are refl ected back from its prey and from obstacles, to its ears and 
sensitive patches on its face. By timing these echoes the bat can judge 
its distance from the obstacle or prey. This allows it to fl y and feed in the 
dark. Its body is covered in fur for insulation. Its forearms are covered by a 
membrane of skin to form a wing. The fi ngers are very long to stretch out 
the membrane to increase the surface area of the wing.

inside the leaves, the hairs are triggered, causing the 
leaves to close very rapidly – trapping the animal. The 
leaves then secrete protease enzymes, which digest 
the insect’s protein and produce soluble amino acids. 
These are absorbed by the leaf and used to build new 
proteins. It is unusual for a photosynthetic plant to 
show such rapid movement or to gain nourishment 
other than by photosynthesis.

vibrations. The eyes at the side of the head give the hare good all around 
vision. The hind legs are very long to enable the animal to run away 
from predators and its kick is a good defence mechanism. Some species 
of hare change the colour of their fur in winter from brown to white to 
provide better camoufl age in snow.

adaptive features

Some plants live in very sandy soil, which does not 
retain moisture well. Often this is combined with 
very low rainfall, making access to water difficult. 
Only plants with special adaptations, such as desert 
and sand dune species, can survive.
 Cacti
Cacti are adapted to hot, dry conditions in several 
ways. Often they have no leaves, or the leaves are 
reduced to spines. This reduces the surface area 
for transpiration and also acts as a defence against 
herbivores. Photosynthesis is carried out by a thick 
green stem, which offers only a small surface area 
for evaporation. Cacti are succulent, i.e. they store 
water in their fleshy tissues and draw on this store for 
photosynthesis (Figure 18.17).

Key definitions
Adaptive features are the inherited functional features of an 

organism that increase its fitness.

Fitness is the probability of that organism surviving and 
reproducing in the environment in which it is found.

Adaptations to arid conditions
In both hot and cold climates, plants may suffer 
from water shortage. High temperatures accelerate 
evaporation from leaves. At very low temperatures 
the soil water becomes frozen and therefore 
unavailable to the roots of plants. Plants modified to 
cope with lack of water are called xerophytes.

It is thought that the autumn leaf-fall of 

deciduous trees and shrubs is an essential adaptation 
to winter ‘drought’. Loss of leaves removes virtually 
all evaporating surfaces at a time when water may 
become unavailable. Without leaves, however, the 
plants cannot make food by photosynthesis and so 
they enter a dormant condition in which metabolic 
activity is at a low level.
 Pine tree
The pine tree (Pinus) (Figure 18.16) is an evergreen 
tree that survives in cold climates. It has small, 
compact, needle-like leaves. The small surface area of 
such leaves offers little resistance to high winds. This 
helps to resist wind damage and can reduce the amount 
of water lost in transpiration. However, photosynthesis 
can continue whenever water is available. Sunken 
stomata create high humidity and reduce transpiration. 
A thick waxy cuticle is present on the epidermis to 
prevent evaporation from the surface of the leaf.

Figure 18.17  A cactus (succulent) growing in desert conditions in Arizona

The stomata of many cacti are closed during the day 
when temperatures are high, and open at night when 
evaporation is at a minimum. This strategy requires 
a slightly different form of photosynthesis. At night, 
carbon dioxide diffuses in through the open stomata 
and is ‘fixed’ (i.e. incorporated) into an organic 
acid. Little water vapour is lost at night. In the 
daytime the stomata are closed but the organic acid 
breaks down to yield carbon dioxide, which is then 
built into sugars by photosynthesis. Closure of the 
stomata in the daytime greatly reduces water loss.

 Marram grass
Marram grass (Ammophila) lives on sand dunes 
(Figure 18.18), where water drains away very 
quickly. It has very long roots to search for water 
deep down in the sand. Its leaves roll up into straw-
like tubes in dry weather due to the presence of 
hinge cells, which become fl accid as they lose water 
(Figure 18.19). Leaf rolling, along with the fact that 
the stomata are sunken, helps to increase humidity 
around the stomata, reducing transpiration. The 
presence of fi ne hairs around the stomata reduces air 
movement so humidity builds up and transpiration 
is reduced. 

Adaptations to living in water
Plants adapted to living in water are called 
hydrophytes. An example is the water lily 
(Nymphaea) (Figure 18.20). The leaves contain 
large air spaces to make them buoyant, so they fl oat 
on or near the surface (Figure 18.21). This enables 
them to gain light for photosynthesis. The lower 
epidermis lacks stomata to prevent water entering 
the air spaces, while stomata are present on the 
upper epidermis for gas exchange. With land plants, 
most stomata are usually on the lower epidermis. 
The roots of hydrophytes, which can be poorly 
developed, also contain air spaces. This is because 
the mud they grow in is poorly oxygenated and the 
root cells need oxygen for respiration. Stems lack 
much support as the water they are surrounded by 
provides buoyancy for the plant.

●● Selection
Natural selection
Theories of evolution have been put forward in 
various forms for hundreds of years. In 1858, Charles 
Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a theory 
of evolution by natural selection, which is still an 
acceptable theory today.

The theory of evolution by natural selection is as 

follows:
●  Individuals within a species are all slightly different 
from each other (Figure 18.22). These differences 
are called variations.

●  If the climate or food supply changes, individuals 
possessing some of these variations may be better 
able to survive than others. For example, a variety 
of animal that could eat the leaves of shrubs as well 
as grass would be more likely to survive a drought 
than one that fed only on grass.

●  If one variety lives longer than others, it is also 
likely to leave behind more offspring. A mouse 
that lives for 12 months may have ten litters of five 
babies (50 in all). A mouse that lives for 6 months 
may have only five litters of five babies (25 in all).
●  If some of the offspring inherit alleles responsible 

for the variation that helped the parent survive 
better, they too will live longer and have more 
offspring.

●  In time, this particular variety will outnumber and 

finally replace the original variety.

This is sometimes called ‘the survival of the fittest’. 
However, ‘fitness’, in this case, does not mean good 
health but implies that the organism is well fitted to 
the conditions in which it lives.

Thomas Malthus, in 1798, suggested that the 

increase in the size of the human population would 
outstrip the rate of food production. He predicted 
that the number of people would eventually be 
regulated by famine, disease and war. When Darwin 
read the Malthus essay, he applied its principles to 
other populations of living organisms.

He observed that animals and plants produce vastly 

more offspring than can possibly survive to maturity 
and he reasoned that, therefore, there must be a 
‘struggle for survival’.

For example, if a pair of rabbits had eight offspring 

that grew up and formed four pairs, eventually 
having eight offspring per pair, in four generations 

selection

the number of rabbits stemming from the original 
pair would be 512 (i.e. 2 → 8 → 32 → 128 → 512). 
The population of rabbits, however, remains more 
or less constant. Many of the offspring in each 
generation must, therefore, have failed to survive to 
reproductive age.

Figure 18.22  Variation. The garden tiger moths in this picture are all from 
the same family. There is a lot of variation in the pattern on the wings.

Competition and selection
There will be competition between members of 
the rabbit population for food, burrows and mates. 
If food is scarce, space is short and the number of 
potential mates limited, then only the healthiest, 
most vigorous, most fertile and otherwise well-
adapted rabbits will survive and breed.

The competition does not necessarily involve 
direct conflict. The best adapted rabbits may be 
able to run faster from predators, digest their food 
more efficiently, have larger litters or grow coats that 
camouflage them better or more effectively reduce 
heat losses. These rabbits will survive longer and 
leave more offspring. If the offspring inherit the 
advantageous characteristics of their parents, they may 
give rise to a new race of faster, different coloured,

 18  Variation and selection

thicker furred and more fertile rabbits, which gradually 
replace the original, less well-adapted varieties. The 
new variations are said to have survival value.
This is natural selection; the better adapted 
varieties are ‘selected’ by the pressures of the 
environment (selection pressures).

For natural selection to be effective, the variations 
have to be heritable. Variations that are not heritable 
are of no value in natural selection. Training may give 
athletes more efficient muscles, but this characteristic 
will not be passed on to their children.

The peppered moth
A possible example of natural selection is provided by 
a species of moth called the peppered moth, found 
in Great Britain. The common form is speckled but 
there is also a variety that is black. The black variety 
was rare in 1850, but by 1895 in the Manchester 
area of England its numbers had risen to 98% of the 
population of peppered moths. Observation showed 
that the light variety was concealed better than the 
dark variety when they rested on tree-trunks covered 
with lichens (Figure 18.23). In the Manchester area 
of England, pollution had caused the death of the 
lichens and the darkening of the tree-trunks with 
soot. In this industrial area the dark variety was the 
better camouflaged (hidden) of the two and was 
not picked off so often by birds. So the dark variety 
survived better, left more offspring and nearly 
replaced the light form.

The selection pressure, in this case, was presumed 

to be mainly predation by birds. The adaptive 
variation that produced the selective advantage was 
the dark colour.

Although this is an attractive and plausible 

hypothesis of how natural selection could occur, 
some of the evidence does not support the hypothesis 
or has been called into question.

For example, the moths settle most frequently on 
the underside of branches rather than conspicuously 
on tree trunks, as in Figure 18.23. Also, in several 
unpolluted areas the dark form is quite abundant, 
for example 80% in East Anglia in England. Research 
is continuing in order to test the hypothesis.

Selective breeding
The process of selective breeding involves humans 
selecting individuals with desirable features. These 
individuals are then cross-bred to produce the 
next generation. Offspring with the most desirable 
features are chosen to continue the breeding 
programme and the process is repeated over a 
number of generations.

Human communities practise this form of selection 

when they breed plants and animals for specific 
characteristics. The many varieties of cat that you see 
today have been produced by selecting individuals 
with pointed ears, particular fur colour or length, or 
even no tail, etc. One of the kittens in a litter might 
vary from the others by having distinctly pointed ears. 
This individual, when mature, is allowed to breed. 
From the offspring, another very pointed-eared variant 
is selected for the next breeding stock, and so on, until 
the desired or ‘fashionable’ ear shape is established in a 
true-breeding population (Figure 18.24).

More important are the breeding programmes to 
improve agricultural livestock or crop plants. Animal-
breeders will select cows for their high milk yield and

Evolution

Key definitions
Adaptation is the process, resulting from natural selection, 

by which populations become more suited to their 
environment over many generations.

Evolution can be described as the change in adaptive features 

of a population over time as a result of natural selection.

Most biologists believe that natural selection, among 
other processes, contributes to the evolution of new 
species and that the great variety of living organisms 
on the Earth is the product of millions of years of 
evolution involving natural selection.
 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria
Antibiotics are drugs used to treat infections caused 
by bacteria (see ‘Medicinal drugs’ in Chapter 15). 
Bacterial cells reproduce very rapidly, perhaps as 
often as once every 20 minutes. Thus a mutation, 
even if it occurs only rarely, is likely to appear in 
a large population of bacteria. If a population 
of bacteria containing one or two drug-resistant 
mutants is subjected to that particular drug, the non-
resistant bacteria will be killed but the drug-resistant 
mutants survive (Figure 15.1). Mutant genes are 
inherited in the same way as normal genes, so when 
the surviving mutant bacteria reproduce, all their 
offspring will be resistant to the drug. 

Selective breeding
An important part of any breeding programme is 
the selection of the desired varieties. The largest 
fruit on a tomato plant might be picked and its seeds 
planted next year. In the next generation, once again 
only seeds from the largest tomatoes are planted. 
Eventually it is possible to produce a true-breeding 
variety of tomato plant that forms large fruits. Figure 
18.25 shows the result of such selective breeding. 
The same technique can be used for selecting other 
desirable qualities, such as flavour and disease 
resistance.

Similar principles can be applied to farm animals. 

Desirable characteristics, such as high milk yield 
and resistance to disease, may be combined. Stock-
breeders will select calves from cows that give large 
quantities of milk. These calves will be used as 
breeding stock to build a herd of high yielders. A 
characteristic such as milk yield is probably under 
the control of many genes. At each stage of selective 
breeding the farmer, in effect, is keeping the 
beneficial genes and discarding the less useful genes 
from his or her animals.

Selective breeding in farm stock can be slow and 

expensive because the animals often have small 
numbers of offspring and breed only once a year.

By producing new combinations of genes, 

selective breeding achieves the same objectives as

that provide an advantage, to cope with changes 
in environmental conditions for example, are more 
likely to survive, while others die before they can 
breed and pass on their genes. However, variation 
within the population remains.

Artificial selection is used by humans to produce 

varieties of animals and plants that have an increased 
economic importance. It is considered a safe way of 
developing new strains of organisms, compared with 
genetic engineering, and is a much faster process than 
natural selection. However, artificial selection removes 
variation from a population, leaving it susceptible 
to disease and unable to cope with changes in 
environmental conditions. Potentially, therefore, 
artificial selection puts a species at risk of extinction.

 18  Variation and selection

genetic engineering but it takes much longer and is 
less predictable.

In selective breeding, the transfer of genes takes 

place between individuals of the same or closely 
related species. Genetic engineering involves transfer 
between unrelated species.

Selective breeding and genetic engineering 
both endeavour to produce new and beneficial 
combinations of genes. Selective breeding, however, 
is much slower and less precise than genetic 
engineering. On the other hand, cross-breeding 
techniques have been around for a very long time 
and are widely accepted.

One of the drawbacks of selective breeding is 
that the whole set of genes is transferred. As well 
as the desirable genes, there may be genes that, in 
a homozygous condition, would be harmful. It is 
known that artificial selection repeated over a large 
number of generations tends to reduce the fitness of 
the new variety.

A long-term disadvantage of selective breeding is the 

loss of variability. By eliminating all the offspring that 
do not bear the desired characteristics, many genes are 
lost from the population. At some future date, when 
new combinations of genes are sought, some of the 
potentially useful ones may no longer be available.

In attempting to introduce, in plants, 

characteristics such as salt tolerance or resistance to 
disease or drought, the geneticist goes back to wild 
varieties, as shown in Figure 18.26. However, with 
the current rate of extinction, this source of genetic 
material is diminishing.

In the natural world, reduction of variability could 
lead to local extinction if the population was unable 
to adapt, by natural selection, to changing conditions.

Comparing natural and artificial 
selection
Natural selection occurs in groups of living 
organisms through the passing on of genes to the 
next generation by the best adapted organisms, 
without human interference. Those with genes

Checklist
After studying Chapter 18 you should know and understand the 
following:

Variation

•  Variation is the differences between individuals of the same 

species.

•  Variations within a species may be inherited or acquired.
•  Continuous variation results in a range of phenotypes 

between two extremes, e.g. height in humans.

•  Discontinuous variation results in a limited number of 
phenotypes with no intermediates, e.g. tongue rolling.

•  Mutation is the way in which new alleles are formed.
•  Increases in the rate of mutation can be caused by ionising 

radiation and some chemicals.

•  Discontinuous variation results, usually, from the effects 

of a single pair of alleles, and produces distinct and 
consistent differences between individuals.

•  Blood groups are an example of discontinuous variation.
•  Discontinuous variations cannot be changed by the 

environment.

•  Phenotypic (continuous) variations are usually 
controlled by a number of genes affecting the 
same characteristic and can be infl uenced by the 
environment.

•  A gene mutation is a change in the base sequence 

of DNA.

•  Sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a change in the base 
sequence of the gene for haemoglobin. This results in 
abnormal haemoglobin, which changes shape when 
oxygen levels are low.

•  The inheritance of sickle-cell anaemia can be predicted 

using genetic diagrams. 

•  People who are heterozygous for the sickle-cell allele have 

a resistance to malaria.

Adaptive features

•  An adaptive feature is an inherited feature that helps an 

organism to survive and reproduce in its environment.

•  Adaptive features of a species can be recognised from its 

image in a drawing or photograph.

•  An adaptive feature is the inherited functional features of 

an organism that increase its fi tness.

•  Fitness is the probability of that organism surviving and 

reproducing in the environment in which it is found.

•  Hydrophytes are plants that have adaptive features to live 

in a watery environment.

•  Xerophytes are plants that have adaptive features to live 

in very dry environments.

Selection

•  Some members of a species may have variations that enable 

them to compete more effectively.

•  These variants will live longer and leave more offspring.
•  If the benefi cial variations are inherited, the offspring will 

also survive longer.

•  The new varieties may gradually replace the older varieties.
•  Natural selection involves the elimination of less well-adapted 

varieties by environmental pressures.

•  Selective breeding is used to improve commercially useful 

plants and animals.

•  Adaptation is the process, resulting from natural selection, 

by which populations become more suited to their 
environment over many generations.

•  The development of strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria 

is an example of natural selection.

•  Selective breeding by artifi cial selection is carried out 

over many generations to improve crop plants and 
domesticated animals.

•  Evolution is the change in adaptive features of a 

population over time as the result of natural selection.

●● Energy ﬂ ow
Nearly all living things depend on the Sun to provide 
energy. This is harnessed by photosynthesising plants 
and the energy is then passed through food chains.

Dependence on sunlight
With the exception of atomic energy and tidal 
power, all the energy released on Earth is derived 
from sunlight. The energy released by animals 
comes, ultimately, from plants that they or their 
prey eat and the plants depend on sunlight for 
making their food. Photosynthesis is a process 
in which light energy is trapped by plants and 
converted into chemical energy (stored in molecules 
such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins). Since all 
animals depend, in the end, on plants for their food, 
they therefore depend indirectly on sunlight. A few 
examples of our own dependence on photosynthesis 
are given below.

Nearly all the energy released on the Earth can 
be traced back to sunlight. Coal comes from tree-
like plants, buried millions of years ago. These 
plants absorbed sunlight for their photosynthesis 
when they were alive. Petroleum was formed, also 
millions of years ago, probably from the partly 
decayed bodies of microscopic algae that lived 
in the sea. These, too, had absorbed sunlight for 
photosynthesis.

8/18/14   9:56 PM

Today it is possible to use mirrors and solar 

panels to collect energy from the Sun directly, but 
the best way, so far, of trapping and storing energy 
from sunlight is to grow plants and make use of 
their products, such as starch, sugar, oil, alcohol and 
wood, for food or as energy sources. For example, 

●● Food chains and food 

webs

Key definitions
A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism 

to the next, beginning with a producer.

A food web is a network of interconnected food chains.
A producer is an organism that makes its own organic nutrients, 
usually using energy from sunlight, through photosynthesis.
A consumer is an organism that gets its energy from feeding 

on other organisms.

A herbivore is an animal that gets its energy by eating plants.
A carnivore is an animal that gets its energy by eating other 

animals.

A decomposer is an organism that gets its energy from dead 

or waste organic material.

‘Interdependence’ means the way in which living 
organisms depend on each other in order to remain 
alive, grow and reproduce. For example, bees depend 
for their food on pollen and nectar from flowers. 
Flowers depend on bees for pollination (Chapter 16). 
Bees and flowers are, therefore, interdependent.
Food chains
One important way in which organisms depend on 
each other is for their food. Many animals, such 
as rabbits, feed on plants. Such animals are called 
herbivores. Animals that eat other animals are called 
carnivores. A predator is a carnivore that kills and 
eats other animals. A fox is a predator that preys 
on rabbits. Scavengers are carnivores that eat the 
dead remains of animals killed by predators. These 
are not hard and fast definitions. Predators will 
sometimes scavenge for their food and scavengers 
may occasionally kill living animals. Animals obtain 
their energy by ingestion.

Basically, all animals depend on plants for their food. 
Foxes may eat rabbits, but rabbits feed on grass. A hawk 
eats a lizard, the lizard has just eaten a grasshopper 
but the grasshopper was feeding on a grass blade. This 
relationship is called a food chain (Figure 19.1).

The organisms at the beginning of a food chain are 
usually very numerous while the animals at the end of 

Food chains and food webs

sugar from sugar-cane can be fermented to alcohol, 
and used as a motor fuel instead of petrol.

Eventually, through one process or another, all the 

chemical energy in organisms is transferred to the 
environment. However, it is not a cyclical process 
like those described later in this chapter.

Figure 19.1  A food chain. The caterpillar eats the leaf; the blue tit 
eats the caterpillar but may fall prey to the kestrel.

the chain are often large and few in number. The food 
pyramids in Figure 19.2 show this relationship. There 
will be millions of microscopic, single-celled algae in 
a pond (Figure 19.3(a)). These will be eaten by the 
larger but less numerous water fleas and other crustacea 
(Figure 19.3(b)), which in turn will become the food of 
small fish such as minnow and stickleback. The hundreds 
of small fish may be able to provide enough food for 
only four or five large carnivores, like pike or perch.

The organisms at the base of the food pyramids 

in Figure 19.2 are plants. Plants produce food from 
carbon dioxide, water and salts (see ‘Photosynthesis’, 
Chapter 6), and are, therefore, called producers. 
The animals that eat the plants are called primary 
consumers, e.g. grasshoppers. Animals that prey on 
the plant-eaters are called secondary consumers, 
e.g. shrews, and these may be eaten by tertiary 
consumers, e.g. weasels or kestrels (Figure 19.4).

Figure 19.3  Plankton. The microscopic organisms that live in the surface waters of the sea or fresh water are called, collectively, plankton. The 
single-celled algae (see Chapter 1) are the phytoplankton. They are surrounded by water, salts and dissolved carbon dioxide. Their chloroplasts absorb 
sunlight and use its energy for making food by photosynthesis. Phytoplankton is eaten by small animals in the zooplankton, mainly crustacea (see 
Chapter 1). Small fi sh will eat the crustacea.

Pyramids of numbers 
The width of the bands in Figure 19.2 is meant to 
represent the relative number of organisms at each 
trophic level. So the diagrams are sometimes called 
pyramids of numbers.

However, you can probably think of situations 
where a pyramid of numbers would not show the 
same effect. For example, a single sycamore tree may 
provide food for thousands of greenfl y. One oak tree 
may feed hundreds of caterpillars. In these cases the 
pyramid of numbers is upside-down, as shown in 
Figure 19.5.
Food webs
Food chains are not really as straightforward as 
described above, because most animals eat more than 
one type of food. A fox, for example, does not feed 
entirely on rabbits but takes beetles, rats and voles in 

Figure 19.4  The kestrel, a secondary or tertiary consumer

a food web can be drawn up (Figure 19.6).

The food webs for land, sea and fresh water, or for 
ponds, rivers and streams, will all be different. Food 
webs will also change with the seasons when the food 
supply changes.
If some event interferes with a food web, all the 
organisms in it are affected in some way. For 
example, if the rabbits in Figure 19.6 were to die 
out, the foxes, owls and stoats would eat more 
beetles and rats. Something like this happened in 
1954 when the disease myxomatosis wiped out 

Food chains and food webs

nearly all the rabbits in England. Foxes ate more 
voles, beetles and blackberries, and attacks on lambs 
and chickens increased. Even the vegetation was 
affected because the tree seedlings that the rabbits 
used to nibble on were able to grow. As a result, 
woody scrubland started to develop on what had 
been grassy downs. A similar effect is shown in 
Figure 19.7. 
The effects of over-harvesting
Over-harvesting causes the reduction in numbers of 
a species to the point where it is endangered or made 
extinct. As a result biodiversity is affected. The species 
may be harvested for food, or for body parts such 
as tusks (elephants), horns (rhinos – Figure 19.8), 
bones and fur (tigers) or for selling as pets (reptiles, 
birds and fish, etc.). In parts of Africa, bush meat 
is used widely as a source of food. Bush meat is the 
flesh of primates, such as monkeys. However, hunting 
these animals is not always regulated or controlled 
and rare species can be threatened as a result of 
indiscriminate killing. (See also ‘Habitat destruction’ 
in Chapter 21.)

Overﬁ shing
Small populations of humans, taking fi sh from lakes 
or oceans and using fairly basic methods of capture, 
had little effect on fi sh numbers. At present, however, 
commercial fi shing has intensifi ed to the point 
where some fi sh stocks are threatened or can no 
longer sustain fi shing. In the past 100 years, fi shing 
fl eets have increased and the catching methods have 
become more sophisticated.

If the number of fi sh removed from a population 
exceeds the number of young fi sh reaching maturity, 
then the population will decline (Figure 19.9). 

At fi rst, the catch size remains the same but it takes 

longer to catch it. Then the catch starts to contain 
a greater number of small fi sh so that the return 

per day at sea goes down even more. Eventually the 
stocks are so depleted that it is no longer economical 
to exploit them. The costs of the boats, the fuel and 
the wages of the crew exceed the value of the catch. 
Men are laid off, boats lie rusting in the harbour and 
the economy of the fi shing community and those 
who depend on it is destroyed. Overfi shing has 
severely reduced stocks of many fi sh species: herring 
in the North Sea, halibut in the Pacifi c and anchovies 
off the Peruvian coast, for example. In 1965, 
1.3 million tonnes of herring were caught in the 
North Sea. By 1977 the catch had diminished to 
44 000 tonnes, i.e. about 3% of the 1965 catch.

Similarly, whaling has reduced the population 

of many whale species to levels that give cause for 
concern. Whales were the fi rst marine organisms to 
face extinction through overfi shing. This happened 

288

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_19.indd   288

8/18/14   9:57 PM

in the early 1800s when they were killed for their 
blubber (a thick fat layer around the body of the 
mammal) for use as lamp oil. The blue whale’s 
numbers have been reduced from about 2 000 000 
to 6000 as a result of intensive hunting.

Overfishing can reduce the populations of 

fish species and can also do great damage to the 
environment where they live. For example, the use of 
heavy nets dragged along the sea floor to catch the fish 
can wreck coral reefs, destroying the habitats of many 
other animal species. Even if the reef is not damaged, 
fishing for the top predators such as grouper fish has 
a direct effect on the food chain: fish lower down the 
chain increase in numbers, and overgraze on the reef. 
This process is happening on the Great Barrier Reef in 
Australia. Grouper fish are very slow growing and take 
a long time to become sexually mature, so the chances 
of them recovering from overfishing are low and they 
are becoming endangered.
Introducing foreign species to a 
habitat
One of the earliest examples of this process was the 
accidental introduction of rats to the Galapagos 
Islands by pirates or whalers in the 17th or 18th 
centuries. The rats had no natural predators and 
food was plentiful: they fed on the eggs of birds, 

Food chains and food webs

reptiles and tortoises, along with young animals. 
The Galapagos Islands provide a habitat for many 
rare species, which became endangered as a result 
of the presence of the rats. A programme of rat 
extermination is now being carried out on the islands 
to protect their unique biodiversity.

The prickly pear cactus, Opuntia, was introduced 

to Australia in 1839 for use as a living fence to 
control the movement of cattle, but its growth got 
out of control because of the lack of herbivores that 
eat it. Millions of acres of land became unusable. 
A moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, whose young feed 
on the cactus, was successfully introduced from 
Argentina and helped to control the spread of 
the cactus. Other places with similar problems, 
for example the island of Nevis in the West 
Indies, followed Australia’s example, but with 
less successful results. The moth had no natural 
predators and ate other native cactus species as well 
as the prickly pear, bringing them to the brink of 
extinction. The moth is now spreading to parts of 
the United States of America and poses a threat to 
other cactus species.

Food chains and webs can also be disrupted by 
the use of pesticides and other poisons, sometimes 
released accidentally during human activities. More 
details can be found in Chapter 21.

Energy transfer
Study Figure 19.1. When an herbivorous animal 
eats a plant (the caterpillar feeding on a leaf), the 
chemical energy stored in that plant leaf is transferred 
to the herbivore. Similarly, when a carnivore (the 
blue tit) eats the herbivore, the carnivore gains the 
energy stored in the herbivore. If the carnivore is 
eaten by another carnivore (the kestrel), the energy is 
transferred again.

 Use of sunlight
To try and estimate just how much life the Earth can 
support it is necessary to examine how efficiently 
the Sun’s energy is used. The amount of energy 
from the Sun reaching the Earth’s surface in 1 year 
ranges from 2 million to 8 million kilojoules per 
m2 (2–8 ×109 J m–2 yr–1) depending on the latitude. 
When this energy falls onto grassland, about 
20% is reflected by the vegetation, 39% is used in 
evaporating water from the leaves (transpiration), 

40% warms up the plants, the soil and the air, 
leaving only about 1% to be used in photosynthesis 
for making new organic matter in the leaves of the 
plants (Figure 19.10).

This figure of 1% will vary with the type of 
vegetation being considered and with climatic 
factors, such as availability of water and the 
soil temperature. Sugar-cane grown in ideal 
conditions can convert 3% of the Sun’s energy into 
photosynthetic products; sugar-beet at the height of 
its growth has nearly a 9% efficiency. Tropical forests 
and swamps are far more productive than grassland 
but it is difficult, and, in some cases undesirable, to 
harvest and utilise their products.

In order to allow crop plants to approach 

their maximum efficiency they must be provided 
with sufficient water and mineral salts. This can 
be achieved by irrigation and the application of 
fertiliser.

Figure 19.10  Absorption of Sun’s energy by plants 

 Energy transfer between organisms
Having considered the energy conversion from 
sunlight to plant products, the next step is to study 
the efficiency of transmission of energy from plant 
products to primary consumers. On land, primary 
consumers eat only a small proportion of the 
available vegetation. In a deciduous forest only about 
2% is eaten; in grazing land, 40% of the grass may be 
eaten by cows. In open water, however, where the 
producers are microscopic plants (phytoplankton, 
see Figure 19.3(a)) and are swallowed whole by the 
primary consumers in the zooplankton (see Figure 
19.3(b)), 90% or more may be eaten. In the land 
communities, the parts of the vegetation not eaten 
by the primary consumers will eventually die and be 
used as a source of energy by the decomposers.

A cow is a primary consumer; over 60% of the 

grass it eats passes through its alimentary canal 
(Chapter 7) without being digested. Another 30% is 
used in the cow’s respiration to provide energy for its 
movement and other life processes. Less than 10% of 
the plant material is converted into new animal tissue 
to contribute to growth (Figure 19.11). This figure 
will vary with the diet and the age of the animal. In a 
fully grown animal all the digested food will be used 
for energy and replacement and none will contribute 
to growth. Economically it is desirable to harvest the 
primary consumers before their rate of growth starts 
to fall off.

The transfer of energy from primary to secondary 
consumers is probably more efficient, since a greater 
proportion of the animal food is digested and 
absorbed than is the case with plant material. The 
transfer of energy at each stage in a food chain may 

Figure 19.11  Energy transfer from plants to animals

be represented by classifying the organisms in a 
community as producers, or primary, secondary or 
tertiary consumers, and showing their relative masses 
in a pyramid such as the one shown in Figure 19.2 but 
on a more accurate scale. In Figure 19.12 the width 
of the horizontal bands is proportional to the masses 
(dry weight) of the organisms in a shallow pond.

Key definitions
The trophic level of an organism is its position in a food 
chain, food web or pyramid of numbers or biomass.

It is very unusual for food chains to have more than 
five trophic levels because, on average, about 90% of 
the energy is lost at each level. Consequently, very little 
of the energy entering the chain through the producer 
is available to the top consumer. The food chain below 
shows how the energy reduces through the chain. It is 
based on grass obtaining 100 units of energy.

 Energy transfer in agriculture
In human communities, the use of plant products 
to feed animals that provide meat, eggs and dairy 
products is wasteful, because only 10% of the plant

material is converted to animal products. It is more 
economical to eat bread made from the wheat 
than to feed the wheat to hens and then eat the 
eggs and chicken meat. This is because eating the 
wheat as bread avoids using any part of its energy 
to keep the chickens alive and active. Energy losses 
can be reduced by keeping hens indoors in small 
cages, where they lose little heat to the atmosphere 
and cannot use much energy in movement 
(Figure 19.13). The same principles can be applied 
in ‘intensive’ methods of rearing calves. However, 
many people feel that these methods are less than 
humane, and the saving of energy is far less than if 
the plant products were eaten directly by humans, as 
is the case in vegetarians.

Food chains and food webs

 Pyramids of biomass
As stated earlier, displaying food chains using 
pyramids of number, such as those shown in 
Figure 19.5, can produce inverted pyramids. This is 
because the top consumers may be represented by 
large numbers of very small organisms, for example, 
fleas feeding on an owl. The way around this problem 
is to consider not the single tree, but the mass of the 
leaves that it produces in the growing season, and the 
mass of the insects that can live on them. Biomass 
is the term used when the mass of living organisms 
is being considered, and pyramids of biomass can be 
constructed as in Figure 19.12. A pyramid of biomass 
is nearly always the correct pyramid shape.

An alternative is to calculate the energy available 

in a year’s supply of leaves and compare this with 
the energy needed to maintain the population of 
insects that feed on the leaves. This would produce a 
pyramid of energy, with the producers at the bottom 
having the greatest amount of energy. Each successive 
trophic level would show a reduced amount of energy.

The elements that make up living organisms are 
recycled, i.e. they are used over and over again (see 
next section). This is not the case with energy, which 
flows from producers to consumers and is eventually 
lost to the atmosphere as heat. 

Recycling
There are a number of organisms that have 
not been fitted into the food webs or food 
chains described so far. Among these are the 
decomposers. Decomposers do not obtain their 
food by photosynthesis, nor do they kill and eat 
living animals or plants. Instead they feed on dead 
and decaying matter such as dead leaves in the 
soil or rotting tree-trunks (Figure 19.14). The 
most numerous examples are the fungi, such as 
mushrooms, toadstools or moulds, and the bacteria, 
particularly those that live in the soil. They produce 
extracellular enzymes that digest the decaying 
matter and then they absorb the soluble products 
back into their cells. In so doing, they remove the 
dead remains of plants and animals, which would 
otherwise collect on the Earth’s surface. They also 
break these remains down into substances that can 
be used by other organisms. Some bacteria, for 
example, break down the protein of dead plants and 
animals and release nitrates, which are taken up by

crowded and cramped conditions with no opportunity to move about or 
scratch in the soil as they would normally do.

Consideration of the energy flow of a modern 
agricultural system reveals other sources of 
inefficiency. To produce 1 tonne of nitrogenous 
fertiliser takes energy equivalent to burning 5 tonnes 
of coal. Calculations show that if the energy needed 
to produce the fertiliser is added to the energy used 
to produce a tractor and to power it, the energy 
derived from the food so produced is less than that 
expended in producing it.

and the animals that eat the plants and each other 
are the consumers. The bacteria and fungi, especially 
those in the soil, are called the decomposers because 
they break down the dead remains and release the 
chemicals for the plants to use again. Three examples 
of recycling, for water, carbon and nitrogen, are 
described in the next section.

The general idea of recycling is illustrated in

●● Nutrient cycles
The carbon cycle
Carbon is an element that occurs in all the 
compounds which make up living organisms. 
Plants get their carbon from carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere and animals get their carbon from plants. 
The carbon cycle, therefore, is mainly concerned with 
what happens to carbon dioxide (Figure 19.16).

Removal of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere
Photosynthesis
Green plants remove carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere as a result of their photosynthesis. The 
carbon from the carbon dioxide is built first into a 
carbohydrate such as sugar. Some of this is changed into 
starch or the cellulose of cell walls, and the proteins, 
pigments and other compounds of a plant. When the 
plants are eaten by animals, the organic plant material 
is digested, absorbed and built into the compounds 
making up the animals’ tissues. Thus the carbon atoms 
from the plant become part of the animal.
Fossilisation
Any environment that prevents rapid decay 
may produce fossils. The carbon in the dead

Addition of carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere
Respiration
Plants and animals obtain energy by oxidising 
carbohydrates in their cells to carbon dioxide and 
water (Chapter 12). The carbon dioxide and water 
are excreted so the carbon dioxide returns once again 
to the atmosphere.
Decomposition
A crucial factor in carbon recycling is the process of 
decomposition, or decay. If it were not for decay, 
essential materials would not be released from dead 
organisms. When an organism dies, the enzymes in 
its cells, freed from normal controls, start to digest 
its own tissues (auto-digestion). Soon, scavengers 
appear on the scene and eat much of the remains; 
blowfly larvae devour carcases, earthworms consume 
dead leaves.

Finally the decomposers, fungi and bacteria 

(collectively called micro-organisms), arrive and 
invade the remaining tissues (Figure 19.17). These 
saprophytes secrete extracellular enzymes (Chapter 5) 
into the tissues and reabsorb the liquid products of 
digestion. When the micro-organisms themselves die, 
auto-digestion takes place, releasing the products 
such as nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, etc. into the soil 
or the surrounding water to be taken up again by the 
producers in the ecosystem.

Figure 19.17  Mould fungus growing on over-ripe oranges

The speed of decay depends on the abundance of 
micro-organisms, temperature, the presence of water 
and, in many cases, oxygen. High temperatures speed 
up decay because they speed up respiration of the 
micro-organisms. Water is necessary for all living 
processes and oxygen is needed for aerobic respiration 
of the bacteria and fungi. Decay can take place in 
anaerobic conditions but it is slow and incomplete, as 
in the waterlogged conditions of peat bogs.

nutrient cycles

Combustion (burning)
When carbon-containing fuels such as wood, coal, 
petroleum and natural gas are burned, the carbon is 
oxidised to carbon dioxide (C + O2 → CO2). The 
hydrocarbon fuels, such as coal and petroleum, come 
from ancient plants, which have only partly decomposed 
over the millions of years since they were buried.

So, an atom of carbon which today is in a molecule 

of carbon dioxide in the air may tomorrow be in a 
molecule of cellulose in the cell wall of a blade of 
grass. When the grass is eaten by a cow, the carbon 
atom may become part of a glucose molecule in the 
cow’s bloodstream. When the glucose molecule is 
used for respiration, the carbon atom will be breathed 
out into the air once again as carbon dioxide. 

The same kind of cycling applies to nearly all the 

elements of the Earth. No new matter is created, but 
it is repeatedly rearranged. A great proportion of the 
atoms of which you are composed will, at one time, 
have been part of other organisms.
The effects of the combustion of fossil fuels
If you look back at the carbon cycle, you will see that 
the natural processes of photosynthesis, respiration 
and decomposition would be expected to keep the 
CO2 concentration at a steady level. However, since 
the Industrial Revolution, we have been burning the 
fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum and releasing 
extra CO2 into the atmosphere. As a result, the 
concentration of CO2 has increased from 0.029% to 
0.035% since 1860. It is likely to go on increasing as 
we burn more and more fossil fuel.

Although it is not possible to prove beyond all 

reasonable doubt that production of CO2 and other 
‘greenhouse gases’ is causing a rise in the Earth’s 
temperature, i.e. global warming, the majority of 
scientists and climatologists agree that it is happening 
now and will get worse unless we take drastic action 
to reduce the output of these gases (see ‘Pollution’ 
in Chapter 21 for further details of the greenhouse 
effect and global warming).

Another factor contributing to the increase 
in atmospheric CO2 is deforestation. Trees are 
responsible for removing gaseous CO2 and trapping the 
carbon in organic molecules (carbohydrates, proteins 
and fats – see Chapter 4). When they are cut down the 
amount of photosynthesis globally is reduced. Often 
deforestation is achieved by a process called ‘slash and 
burn’, where the felled trees are burned to provide land 
for agriculture (see ‘Habitat destruction’ in Chapter 21) 
and this releases even more atmospheric CO2.

 19  Organisms and their envirOnment

The water cycle
The water cycle (Figure 19.18) is somewhat different 
from other cycles because only a tiny proportion of the 
water that is recycled passes through living organisms.
Animals lose water by evaporation (Chapter 14), 
defecation (Chapter 7), urination (Chapter 13) and 
exhalation (Chapter 11). They gain water from their 
food and drink. Plants take up water from the soil  
and lose it by transpiration (Chapter 8). Millions of 
tonnes of water are transpired, but only a tiny fraction 
of this has taken part in the reactions of respiration 
(Chapter 12) or photosynthesis (Chapter 6).

The great proportion of water is recycled without 

the intervention of animals or plants. The Sun 
shining and the wind blowing over the oceans 
evaporate water from their vast, exposed surfaces. 
The water vapour produced in this way enters the 
atmosphere and eventually condenses to form 
clouds. The clouds release their water in the form 
of rain or snow (precipitation). The rain collects 

in streams, rivers and lakes and ultimately finds its 
way back to the oceans. The human population 
diverts some of this water for drinking, washing, 
cooking, irrigation, hydroelectric schemes and other 
industrial purposes, before allowing it to return 
to the sea.

The nitrogen cycle
When a plant or animal dies, its tissues decompose, 
partly as a result of the action of saprotrophic 
bacteria. One of the important products of the decay 
of animal and plant protein is ammonia (NH3, a 
compound of nitrogen), which is washed into the 
soil (Figure 19.20). It dissolves readily in water to 
form ammonium ions (NH4−).

The excretory products of animals contain 
nitrogenous waste products such as ammonia, 
urea and uric acid (Chapter 13). Urea is formed 
in the liver of humans as a result of deamination. 
The organic matter in animal droppings is also 
decomposed by soil bacteria.

 Processes that add nitrates to soil
Nitrifying bacteria
These are bacteria living in the soil, which use the 
ammonia from excretory products and decaying 
organisms as a source of energy (as we use glucose 
in respiration). In the process of getting energy from 
ammonia, called nitrification, the bacteria produce 
nitrates.
• The ‘nitrite’ bacteria oxidise ammonium 
compounds to nitrites (NH4− → NO2−).

• ‘Nitrate’ bacteria oxidise nitrites to nitrates  

(NO2− → NO3−).

Although plant roots can take up ammonia in the 
form of its compounds, they take up nitrates more 
readily, so the nitrifying bacteria increase the fertility 
of the soil by making nitrates available to the plants.

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
This is a special group of nitrifying bacteria that can 
absorb nitrogen as a gas from the air spaces in the soil, 
and build it into compounds of ammonia. Nitrogen 
gas cannot itself be used by plants. When it has been 
made into a compound of ammonia, however, it 
can easily be changed to nitrates by other nitrifying 
bacteria. The process of building the gas, nitrogen, into 
compounds of ammonia is called nitrogen fixation. 
Some of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria live freely in the 
soil. Others live in the roots of leguminous plants 
(peas, beans, clover), where they cause swellings called 
root nodules (Figure 19.19). These leguminous plants 
are able to thrive in soils where nitrates are scarce, 
because the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their nodules 
make compounds of nitrogen available for them. 
Leguminous plants are also included in crop rotations 
to increase the nitrate content of the soil.

nutrient cycles

Lightning
The high temperature of lightning discharge causes 
some of the nitrogen and oxygen in the air to 
combine and form oxides of nitrogen. These dissolve 
in the rain and are washed into the soil as weak acids, 
where they form nitrates. Although several million 
tonnes of nitrate may reach the Earth’s surface in 
this way each year, this forms only a small fraction of 
the total nitrogen being recycled.

 Processes that remove nitrates from the soil
Uptake by plants
Plant roots absorb nitrates from the soil and 
combine them with carbohydrates to make amino 
acids, which are built up into proteins (Chapter 6). 
These proteins are then available to animals, which 
feed on the plants and digest the proteins in them.
Leaching
Nitrates are very soluble (i.e. dissolve easily in 
water), and as rainwater passes through the soil 
it dissolves the nitrates and carries them away in 
the run-off or to deeper layers of the soil. This is 
called leaching. (See Chapter 21 for some of the 
implications of leaching.)
Denitrifying bacteria
These are bacteria that obtain their energy by 
breaking down nitrates to nitrogen gas, which then 
escapes from the soil into the atmosphere.
All of these processes are summed up in 

Figure 19.20.

 19  Organisms and their envirOnment

●● Population size

Key definition
A population is a group of organisms of one species, living 

and interacting in the same area at the same time.

In biology, the term population always refers 
to a single species. A biologist might refer to 
the population of sparrows in a farmyard or the 
population of carp in a lake. In each case this would 
mean the total numbers of sparrows or the total 
numbers of carp in the stated area.

Population changes
If conditions are ideal, a population can increase 
in size. For this to happen there needs to be a 
good food supply. This will enable organisms to 
breed more successfully to produce more offspring; 
shortage of food can result in starvation, leading to 
death, or force emigration, reducing the population. 
The food shortage may be because the food source 
has all been eaten, or died out, or completed its 
growing season, or there is competition for it with 
other species in the same habitat.

In a habitat there are likely to be predators. If 

heavy predation of a population happens, the rate 
of breeding may be unable to produce enough 
organisms to replace those eaten, so the population 
will drop in numbers. There tends to be a time lag in 
population size change for predators and their prey: 
as predator numbers increase, prey numbers drop 
and as predator numbers drop, prey numbers rise 
again (unless there are other factors that prevent this 
happening) (see ‘Predator–prey relationships’ later in 
this chapter).

Disease can be a particular problem in large 

populations because it can spread easily from 
one individual to another. Epidemics can reduce 
population sizes very rapidly. An example was given 
in the section on food webs: the disease myxomatosis 
is caused by a virus. It wiped out nearly all the rabbits 
in England in 1954 and then spread to other parts 
of Europe, carried by fleas. It was first discovered in 
1896 in Uruguay and was deliberately introduced to 
Australia in 1951 in an attempt to control its large 
rabbit populations. 

When a disease spreads globally it is called a 

pandemic. One of the worst cases experienced by 
humans was known as Spanish flu. This virus killed 
between 40 and 50 million people in 1918. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 
that there were 660 000 malaria deaths in 2010 and 
there were about 219 million cases of the disease. 
Malaria (Chapter 10) is caused by a single-celled 
parasite, spread by mosquitos. It is a treatable disease 
and drugs are gradually becoming more widely 
available to prevent it being fatal. 

Human population
In ad 1000, the world population was probably 
about 300 million. In the early 19th century it 
rose to 1000 million (1 billion), and by 1984 it 
had reached 4.7 billion. In 2000 it reached about 
6 billion and rose to 7.2 billion in 2014. The 
United Nations predicts that the global population 
will decline steadily by 2050, quoting predictions 
of between 8.3 and 10.9 billion people by that 
date. The graph in Figure 19.21 shows that the 
greatest population surge has taken place in the last 
300 years.

Figure 19.21  World population growth. The time scale (horizontal axis) 
is logarithmic. The right-hand space (0–10) represents only 10 years, but 
the left-hand space (100 000–1 million) represents 900 000 years. The 
greatest population growth has taken place in the last 300 years.

Population growth
About 20 years ago, the human population was 
increasing at the rate of 2% a year. This may not 
sound very much, but it means that the world 
population was doubling every 35 years. This 
doubles the demand for food, water, space and other 
resources. Recently, the growth rate has slowed to 
1%. However, it is not the same everywhere. Nigeria’s 
population is growing by 2.9% each year, but Western 
Europe’s grows at only 0.1%.

Traditionally, it is assumed that population growth 
is limited by famine, disease or war. These factors are 

296

8/18/14   9:57 PM

affecting local populations in some parts of the world 
today but they are unlikely to have a limiting effect 
on the rate of overall population growth.

Diseases such as malaria (see Chapter 10) and 

sleeping sickness (spread by tsetse flies) have for many 
years limited the spread of people into areas where 
these insects carry the infections.

Diseases such as bubonic plague and influenza have 

checked population growth from time to time, and 
the current AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is 
having significant effects on population growth and 
life expectancy.
Factors affecting population growth
If a population is to grow, the birth rate must be 
higher than the death rate. Suppose a population 
of 1000 people produces 100 babies each year but 
only 50 people die each year. This means that 50 
new individuals are added to the population each 
year and the population will double in 20 years (or 
less if the new individuals start reproducing at 16) 
(Figure 19.22).

One of the factors affecting population growth 
is infant mortality, i.e. the death rate for children 
less than 1 year old. Populations in the developing 

Key definition
A community is all of the populations of different species in 

an ecosystem.

An ecosystem is a unit containing the community of 

organisms and their environment, interacting together. 
Examples include a decomposing log or a lake.

Communities
A community is made up of all the plants and 
animals living in an ecosystem. In the soil there 
is a community of organisms, which includes 
earthworms, springtails and other insects, mites, 
fungi and bacteria. In a lake, the animal community 
will include fish, insects, crustacea, molluscs and 
protoctista.

The plant community will consist of rooted 

plants with submerged leaves, rooted plants with 
floating leaves, reed-like plants growing at the 
lake margin, plants floating freely on the surface, 
filamentous algae and single-celled algae in the 
surface waters.

number of babies born per family, but because more 
babies are surviving to reach reproductive age. Infant 
mortality is falling and more people are living longer. 
That is, life expectancy is increasing.

Ecosystems
The community of organisms in a habitat, plus the  
non-living part of the environment (air, water, soil, 
light, etc.) make up an ecosystem. A lake is an 
ecosystem, which consists of the plant and animal 
communities mentioned above, and the water, minerals, 
dissolved oxygen, soil and sunlight on which they 
depend. An ecosystem is self-supporting (Figure 19.23).

In a woodland ecosystem, the plants absorb light and

the plants and on each other. The dead remains of 
animals and plants, acted upon by fungi and bacteria,

 19  Organisms and their envirOnment

Lakes and ponds are clear examples of ecosystems. 

Sunlight, water and minerals allow the plants to 
grow and support animal life. The recycling of 
materials from the dead organisms maintains the 
supply of nutrients.

So, a population of carp forms part of the animal 

community living in a habitat called a lake. The 
communities in this habitat, together with their watery 
environment, make up a self-supporting ecosystem.

Figure 19.23  An ‘ecosphere’. The 5-inch globe contains seawater, 
bacteria, algae, snails and a few Pacific shrimps. Given a source of light 
it is a self-supporting system and survives for several years (at least). The 
shrimps live for up to 7 years but few reproduce.

A carp is a secondary consumer at the top of a food 
chain, where it is in competition with other species of 
fish for food and with other carp for food and mates.

The whole of that part of the Earth’s surface 

which contains living organisms (called the 
biosphere) may be regarded as one vast ecosystem.
No new material (in significant amounts) enters 
the Earth’s ecosystem from space and there is no 
significant loss of materials. The whole system 
depends on a constant input of energy from the Sun 
and recycling of the chemical elements.

 Distribution in an ecosystem
All ecosystems contain producers, consumers and 
decomposers. The organisms are not distributed 
uniformly throughout the ecosystem but occupy 
habitats that suit their way of life. 

For example, fish may range freely within an 
aquatic ecosystem but most of them will have 
preferred habitats in which they feed and spend 

298

most of their time. Plaice, sole and flounders feed 
on molluscs and worms on the sea floor, whereas 
herring and mackerel feed on plankton in the surface 
waters. In a pond, the snails do not range much 
beyond the plants where they feed. On a rocky 
coast, limpets and barnacles can withstand exposure 
between the tides and colonise the rocks. Sea 
anemones, on the other hand, are restricted mainly 
to the rocky pools left at low tide.

Factors affecting the increase in 
size of the human population 
 Increase in life expectancy
The life expectancy is the average age to which a 
newborn baby can be expected to live. In Europe 
between 1830 and 1900 the life expectancy was 
40–50 years. Between 1900 and 1950 it rose to 
65 and now stands at 73–74 years. In sub-Saharan 
Africa, life expectancy was rising to 58 years until the 
AIDS epidemic reduced it to about 45 years.

These figures are averages. They do not mean, 

for example, that everyone in the developing world 
will live to the age of 58. In the developing world, 
40% of the deaths are of children younger than 5 
years and only 25–30% are deaths of people over 
60. In Europe, only 5–20% of deaths are those of 
children below the age of 5, but 70–80% are of 
people over 60.

An increase in the number of people over the 
age of 60 does not change the rate of population 
growth much, because these people are past child-
bearing age. On the other hand, if the death rate 
among children falls and the extra children survive 
to reproduce, the population will continue to grow. 
This is the main reason for the rapid population 
growth in the developing world since 1950.

 Causes of the reduction in death rate
The causes are not always easy to identify and vary 
from one community to the next. In 19th century 
Europe, agricultural development and economic 
expansion led to improvements in nutrition, housing 
and sanitation, and to clean water supplies. These 
improvements reduced the incidence of infectious 
diseases in the general population, and better-fed 
children could resist these infections when they 
did meet them. The drop in deaths from infectious 
diseases probably accounted for three-quarters of the 
total fall in deaths.

Population size

The social changes probably affected the population 

growth more than did the discovery of new drugs 
or improved medical techniques. Because of these 
techniques – particularly immunisation – diphtheria, 
tuberculosis and polio are now rare (Figure 19.24), 
and by 1977 smallpox had been wiped out by the 
World Health Organization’s vaccination campaign.
In the developing world, sanitation, clean water 

supplies and nutrition are improving slowly. The 
surge in the population since 1950 is likely to be 
at least 50% due to modern drugs, vaccines and 
insecticides.

immunisation. The arrows show when 50% or more of children were 
vaccinated. Note that the rate was already falling but was greatly 
increased by immunisation.

Stability and growth
Up to 300 years ago, the world population was 
relatively stable. Fertility (the birth rate) was high 
and so was the mortality rate (death rate). Probably 
less than half the children born lived to have children 
of their own. Many died in their first year (infant 
mortality), and many mothers died during childbirth.
No one saw any point in reducing the birth rate. If 
you had a lot of children, you had more help on your 
land and a better chance that some of them would 
live long enough to care for you in your old age.

In the past 300 years, the mortality rate has fallen 

but the birth rate has not gone down to the same 
extent. As a result the population has expanded rapidly.

In 18th century Europe, the fertility rate 

was about 5. This means that, on average, each 
woman would have five children. When the death 
rate fell, the fertility rate lagged behind so that the 
population increased. However, the fertility rate has 
now fallen to somewhere between 1.4 and 2.6 and 
the European population is more or less stable.

A fall in the fertility rate means that young people 

will form a smaller proportion of the population. 
There will also be an increasing proportion of old 
people for the younger generation to look after. In 
Britain it is estimated that, between 1981 and 1991, 
the number of people aged 75–84 increased by 16%. 
The number of those over 85 increased by about 
46% (Figure 19.25).

In the developing world, the fertility rate has 

dropped from about 6.2 to 3.0. This is still higher 
than the mortality rate. An average fertility rate of 
2.1 is necessary to keep the population stable.

As a community grows wealthier, the birth rate 
goes down. There are believed to be four reasons:
•  Longer and better education: Marriage is 

postponed and a better-educated couple will have 
learned about methods of family limitation.

•  Better living conditions: Once people realise 

that half their offspring are not going to die from 
disease or malnutrition, family sizes fall.

•  Agriculture and cities: Modern agriculture is no 
longer labour intensive. Farmers do not need large 
families to help out on the land. City dwellers do 
not depend on their offspring to help raise crops 
or herd animals.

•  Application of family planning methods: Either 

natural methods of birth control or the use of 
contraceptives is much more common.

It takes many years for social improvements to 
produce a fall in the birth rate. Some countries 
are trying to speed up the process by encouraging 
couples to limit their family size (Figure 19.26), or 
by penalising families who have too many children.

Meanwhile the population goes on growing. 

The United Nations expect that the birth rate and 
death rate will not be in balance until the year 2100.

Figure 19.25  Age distribution of population in 1980

By that time the world population may have reached 
10 billion, assuming that the world supply of food 
will be able to feed this population.

In the past few decades, the world has produced 
enough food to feed, in theory, all the extra people. 
But the extra food and the extra people are not 
always in the same place. As a result, 72% of the 
world’s population has a diet that lacks energy, as 
well as other nutrients.

Every year between 1965 and 1975, food 

production in the developed nations rose by 2.8%, 
while the population rose by 0.7%. In the developing 
nations during the same period, food production 
rose by only 1.5% each year, while the annual 
population rise was 2.4%.

The Western world can produce more food than 

its people can consume. Meanwhile people in the 
drier regions of Africa face famine due to drought 
and population pressure on the environment. Even 
if the food could be taken to the developing world, 
people there are often too poor to buy it. Ideally, 
each region needs to grow more food or reduce its 
population until the community is self-supporting. 
Some countries grow tobacco, cotton, tea and coffee 
(cash crops) in order to obtain foreign currency for 
imports from the Western world. This is fine, so 
long as they can also feed their people. But when 
food is scarce, people cannot live on the cash crops.

Figure 19.26  Family planning. A health worker in Bangladesh 
explains the use of a condom.

 Population pressures
More people, more agriculture and more 
industrialisation will put still more pressure on 
the environment unless we are very watchful. If 
we damage the ozone layer, increase atmospheric 
carbon dioxide, release radioactive products or allow 
farmland to erode, we may meet with additional 
limits to population growth.

 Sigmoid population growth curves

 Population growth
A population will not necessarily be evenly spread 
throughout its habitat, nor will its numbers remain 
steady. The population will also be made up of a 
wide variety of individuals: adults (male and female), 
juveniles, larvae, eggs or seeds, for example. In studying 
populations, these variables often have to be simplified.
In the simplest case, where a single species is allowed 

to grow in laboratory conditions, the population 
develops more or less as shown in Figure 19.27.

Figure 19.27  The sigmoid curve (Paramecium caudatum). This 
is the characteristic growth pattern of a population when food is 
abundant at first.

The population might be of yeast cells growing in 
a sugar solution, flour beetles in wholemeal flour 
or weevils in a grain store. The curve shown in 
Figure 19.27 was obtained using a single-celled 
organism called Paramecium (see Chapter 1), which 
reproduces by dividing into two (binary fission). 
The sigmoid (S-shaped) form of the graph can be 
explained as follows:
• A: Lag phase. The population is small. Although 
the numbers double at each generation, this does 
not result in a large increase.

•  B: Exponential phase (log phase). Continued 
doubling of the population at each generation 
produces a logarithmic growth rate (e.g. 64 – 128 – 
256 – 512 – 1024). When a population of four 
doubles, it is not likely to strain the resources of the 
habitat, but when a population of 1024 doubles 
there is likely to be considerable competition for food 
and space and the growth rate starts to slow down.

Population size

• C: Stationary phase. The resources will no longer 

support an increasing population. At this stage, 
limiting factors come into play. The food supply 
may limit further expansion of the population, 
diseases may start to spread through the dense 
population and overcrowding may lead to a fall 
in reproduction rate. Now the mortality rate 
(death rate) equals the reproduction rate, so the 
population numbers stay the same. 

•  D: Death phase. The mortality rate (death rate) 
is now greater than the reproduction rate, so the 
population numbers begin to drop. Fewer offspring 
will live long enough to reproduce. The decline in 
population numbers can happen because the food 
supply is insufficient, waste products contaminate the 
habitat or disease spreads through the population.

 Limits to population growth
The sigmoid curve is a very simplified model of 
population growth. Few organisms occupy a habitat 
on their own, and the conditions in a natural habitat 
will be changing all the time. The steady state of the 
population in part C of the sigmoid curve is rarely 
reached in nature. In fact, the population is unlikely 
to reach its maximum theoretical level because of the 
many factors limiting its growth. These are called 
limiting factors.
Competition
If, in the laboratory, two species of Paramecium 
(P. aurelia and P. caudatum) are placed in an aquarium 
tank, the population growth of P. aurelia follows the 
sigmoid curve but the population of P. caudatum soon 
declines to zero because P. aurelia takes up food more 
rapidly than P. caudatum (Figure 19.28).

This example of competition for food is only one 

of many factors in a natural environment that will 
limit a population or cause it to change.
Abiotic and biotic limiting factors
Plant populations will be affected by abiotic (non-
biological) factors such as rainfall, temperature and 
light intensity. The population of small annual plants 
may be greatly reduced by a period of drought; a 
severe winter can affect the numbers of more hardy 
perennial plants. Biotic (biological) factors affecting 
plants include their leaves being eaten by browsing 
and grazing animals or by caterpillars and other 
insects, and the spread of fungus diseases.

faster than P. caudatum.

Figure 19.29  A colony of nesting gannets. Availability of suitable nest 
sites is one of the factors that limits the population.

The size of an animal population will also be 

affected by the numbers of animals entering 
from other localities (immigration) or leaving the 
population (emigration).

Animal populations, too, will be limited by abiotic 
factors such as seasonal changes. A cold winter can 
severely reduce the populations of small birds. However, 
animal populations are also greatly affected by biotic 
factors such as the availability of food, competition for 
nest sites (Figure 19.29), predation (i.e. being eaten by 
other animals), parasitism and diseases.

In a natural environment, it is rarely possible to say 

whether the fluctuations observed in a population 
are mainly due to one particular factor because there 
are so many factors at work. In some cases, however, 
the key factors can be identified as mainly responsible 
for limiting the population.
Predator–prey relationships
A classic example of predator–prey relationships comes 
from an analysis of the fluctuating populations of 
lynxes and snowshoe hares in Canada. The figures are 
derived from the numbers of skins sold by trappers to 
the Hudson’s Bay Company between 1845 and 1945.

The lynx preys on the snowshoe hare, and the most 
likely explanation of the graph in Figure 19.30 is 
that an increase in the hare population allowed the 
predators to increase. Eventually the increasing 
numbers of lynxes caused a reduction in the hare 
population.

However, seasonal or other changes affecting one 

or both of the animals could not be ruled out.

Checklist
After studying Chapter 19 you should know and understand the 
following:

Energy flow

•  The Sun is the principal source of energy input to biological 

systems.

•  Energy from the Sun flows through living organisms. 
•  First, light energy is converted into chemical energy 
in photosynthetic organisms. Then they are eaten by 
herbivores. Carnivores eat herbivores. 

•  As organisms die, the energy is transferred to the environment.

Food chains and food webs

•  A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one 

organism to the next, beginning with a producer.

•  A food web is a network of interconnected food chains.
•  Producers are organisms that make their own organic 
nutrients, usually using energy from sunlight, through 
photosynthesis.

•  Consumers are organisms that get their energy from feeding 

on other organisms.

•  A herbivore is an animal that gets its energy by eating plants.
•  A carnivore is an animal that gets its energy by eating other 

animals.

•  All animals depend, ultimately, on plants for their source of food.
•  Plants are the producers in a food web; animals may be 

primary, secondary or tertiary consumers.

•  A pyramid of numbers has levels which represent the number 

of each species in a food chain. There are usually fewer 
consumers than producers, forming a pyramid shape.

•  Over-harvesting unbalances food chains and webs, as does 

the introduction of foreign species to a habitat.

•  Energy is transferred between trophic levels through feeding.
•  The trophic level of an organism is its position in a food chain. 
•  The transfer of energy from one trophic level to another is 

inefficient.

•  Only about 1% of the Sun’s energy that reaches the Earth’s 

surface is trapped by plants during photosynthesis.

•  At each step in a food chain, only a small proportion of the 
food is used for growth. The rest is used for energy to keep 
the organism alive.

•  Food chains usually have fewer than five trophic levels.
•  Feeding crop plants to animals uses up a lot of energy and 

makes the process inefficient.

•  There is an increased efficiency in supplying green plants as 

human food. 

•  A decomposer is an organism that gets its energy from 

dead or waste organic material.

•  A pyramid of biomass is more useful than a pyramid of 

numbers in representing a food chain.

Nutrient cycles

•  Plants take up carbon dioxide during photosynthesis; all living 

organisms give out carbon dioxide during respiration; the 
burning of carbon-containing fuels produces carbon dioxide.

•  The uptake of carbon dioxide by plants balances the production 

of carbon dioxide from respiration and combustion.

•  The water cycle involves evaporation, transpiration, 

condensation and precipitation (rain).

•  The combustion of fossil fuels and the cutting down of forests 
increases the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.
•  Soil nitrates are derived naturally from the excretory products 

of animals and the dead remains of living organisms.

•  Nitrifying bacteria turn these products into nitrates, which 

are taken up by plants.

•  Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can make nitrogenous compounds 

from gaseous nitrogen.

•  Plants make amino acids and proteins.
•  Animals eat the proteins.
•  Proteins are broken down to remove the nitrogen by the 

process of deamination. 

•  Micro-organisms play an important part in the nitrogen 
cycle. They are involved in decomposition, nitrification, 
nitrogen fixation and denitrification.

Population size

•  A population is a group of organisms of one species, living 

and interacting in the same area at the same time.

•  The factors affecting the rate of population growth for a 
population of an organism include food supply, predation 
and disease.

•  The human population has increased in size rapidly over the 

past 250 years.

•  The world population is growing at the rate of 1.7% each year. 

At this rate, the population more than doubles every 50 years.

•  The rate of increase is slowing down and the population may 

stabilise at 10 billion by the year 2100.

•  A population grows when the birth rate exceeds the death 

rate, provided the offspring live to reproduce.

•  A community is all of the populations of different species 

in an ecosystem.

•  An ecosystem is a unit containing the community of 

organisms and their environment, interacting together.

•  A sigmoid population growth curve for a population 

growing in an environment with limited resources has lag, 
exponential (log), stationary and death phases.

•  In the developed countries, the birth rate and the death 

rate are now about the same.

•  In the developing countries, the birth rate exceeds the death 

rate and their populations are growing. This is not because 
more babies are born, but because more of them survive.

•  The increased survival rate may be due to improved social 
conditions, such as clean water, efficient sewage disposal, 
better nutrition and better housing.

•  It is also the result of vaccination, new drugs and improved 

medical services.

•  The materials that make up living organisms are constantly 

•  As a population becomes wealthier, its birth rate tends to fall.

●● Biotechnology and 
genetic engineering
Biotechnology is the application of biological 
organisms, systems or processes to manufacturing and 
service industries. Genetic engineering involves the 
transfer of genes from one organism to (usually) an 
unrelated species.

Both processes often make use of bacteria because 
of their ability to make complex molecules (proteins 
for example) and their rapid reproduction rate.

Use of bacteria in biotechnology 
and genetic engineering 
Bacteria are useful in biotechnology and genetic 
engineering because they can be grown and 
manipulated without raising ethical concerns. 
They have a genetic code that is the same as all 
other organisms, so genes from other animals 
or plants can be successfully transferred into 
bacterial DNA. 

Bacterial DNA is in the form of a circular strand 

and also small circular pieces called plasmids. 
Scientists have developed techniques to cut open 
these plasmids and insert sections of DNA from 
other organisms into them. When the bacterium 
divides, the DNA in the modifi ed plasmid is copied, 
including the ‘foreign’ DNA. This may contain a 
gene to make a particular protein such as insulin, 
which can be extracted and used as a medicine to 
treat diabetes. 

●● Biotechnology
Although biotechnology is ‘hot news’, we have been 
making use of it for hundreds of years. Wine-making, 
the brewing of beer, the baking of bread and the 
production of cheese all depend on fermentation 
processes brought about by yeasts, other fungi and 
bacteria, or enzymes from these organisms.

Antibiotics, such as penicillin, are produced by 

mould fungi or bacteria. The production of industrial 
chemicals such as citric acid or lactic acid needs 
bacteria or fungi to bring about essential chemical 
changes.

Sewage disposal (Chapter 21) depends on bacteria 
in the fi lter beds to form the basis of the food chain 
that purifi es the effl uent.

Biotechnology is not concerned solely with the 
use of micro-organisms. Cell cultures and enzymes 
also feature in modern developments. In this 
chapter, however, there is space to consider only a 
representative sample of biotechnological processes 
that use micro-organisms.
Biofuels
The term ‘fermentation’ does not apply only to 
alcoholic fermentation but to a wide range of 
reactions, brought about by enzymes or micro-
organisms. In Chapter 12, the anaerobic respiration 
of glucose to alcohol or lactic acid was described as a 
form of fermentation.

Micro-organisms that bring about fermentation are 
using the chemical reaction to produce energy, which 
they need for their living processes. The reactions that 
are useful in fermentation biotechnology are mostly

 20  Biotechnology and genetic engineering

those that produce incompletely oxidised compounds. 
A reaction that goes all the way to carbon dioxide and 
water is not much use in this context.

The micro-organisms are encouraged to grow 

and multiply by providing nutrients such as glucose, 
with added salts and, possibly, vitamins. Oxygen or 
air is bubbled through the culture if the reaction is 
aerobic, or excluded if the process is anaerobic. An 
optimum pH and temperature are maintained for the 
species of microbe being cultured.

In ‘Conservation’ in Chapter 21, it is pointed out 

that ethanol (alcohol), produced from fermented 
sugar or surplus grain, could replace, or at least 
supplement, petrol.

Brazil, Zimbabwe and the USA produce ethanol as 
a renewable source of energy for the motor car. Since 
1990, 30% of new cars in Brazil can use ethanol and 
many more use a mixture of petrol and ethanol. As 
well as being a renewable resource, ethanol produces 
less pollution than petrol.

However, biofuels are not yet economical to 
produce. For example, the energy used to grow, 
fertilise and harvest sugar-cane, plus the cost of 
extracting the sugar and converting it to ethanol, uses 
more energy than the ethanol releases when burned. 

In addition, there are also environmental costs, 

some of which will be outlined in Chapter 21. Forests 
are being destroyed to plant soy beans or oil palms, 
removing the habitats of thousands of organisms, 
some of which, such as the orang-utan, are on the 
verge of extinction.

Another biofuel, oil from rapeseed or sunflower 

seed, can with suitable treatment replace diesel fuel. 
It is less polluting than diesel but more expensive to 
produce.
Bread
Yeast is the micro-organism used in bread-making 
but the only fermentation product needed is carbon 
dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes bubbles in the bread 
dough. These bubbles make the bread ‘light’ in texture.
Flour, water, salt, oil and yeast are mixed to make a 
dough. Yeast has no enzymes for digesting the starch 
in flour but the addition of water activates the amylases 
already present in flour and these digest some of the 
starch to sugar. With highly refined white flour, it may 
be necessary to add sugar to the dough. The yeast 
then ferments the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide.

A protein called gluten gives the dough a sticky, 
plastic texture, which holds the bubbles of gas. The 
dough is repeatedly folded and stretched (‘kneaded’) 
either by hand, in the home, or mechanically in the 
bakery. The dough is then left for an hour or two at 
a temperature of about 27 °C while the yeast does 
its work. The accumulating carbon dioxide bubbles 
make the dough rise to about double its volume 
(Figure 20.1). The dough may then be kneaded 
again or put straight into baking tins and into an 
oven at about 200 °C. This temperature makes the 
bubbles expand more, kills the yeast and evaporates 
the small quantities of alcohol before the dough turns 
into bread.

Figure 20.1  Carbon dioxide produced by the yeast has caused the 
dough to rise.

Enzymes
Enzymes can be produced by commercial 
fermentation using readily available feedstocks such as 
corn-steep liquor or molasses. Fungi (e.g. Aspergillus) 
or bacteria (e.g. Bacillus) are two of the commonest 
organisms used to produce the enzymes.

These organisms are selected because they are 

non-pathogenic and do not produce antibiotics. The 
fermentation process is similar to that described for 
penicillin. If the enzymes are extracellular (Chapter 5) 
then the liquid feedstock is filtered from the organism 
and the enzyme is extracted (Figure 20.2). If the 
enzymes are intracellular, the micro-organisms have 
to be filtered from the feedstock. They are then 
crushed and the enzymes extracted with water or 
other solvents.

Figure 20.2  Principles of enzyme production from micro-organisms

Using the techniques of genetic engineering, new 
genes can be introduced into the microbes to 
‘improve’ the action of the enzymes coded for by the 
genes (e.g. making the enzymes more heat stable).

One effective way of using enzymes is by 

‘immobilising’ them. The enzymes or the micro-
organisms that produce them are held in or on beads 
or membranes of an insoluble and inert substance, 
e.g. plastic. The beads or membranes are packed into 
columns and the substrate is poured over them at 
the optimum rate. This method has the advantage 
that the enzyme is not lost every time the product 
is extracted. Immobilised enzymes also allow the 
process to take place in a continuous way rather than 
a batch at a time.

Some commercial uses of enzymes are listed below.
● Proteases: In washing powders for dissolving stains 
from, e.g. egg, milk and blood; removing hair from 
animal hides; cheese manufacture; tenderising meat.

● Lipases: Flavour enhancer in cheese; in washing 

powders for removal of fatty stains.

● Pectinases: Clarification of fruit juices; maximising 

juice extraction.

● Amylases: Production of glucose from starch.
Pectinases are used to separate the juices from 
fruit such as apples. The enzymes can be extracted 

Biotechnology

from fungi such as Aspergillus niger. They work by 
breaking down pectin, the jelly-like substance that 
sticks plant cell walls to each other. The enzymes can 
also be used to clarify fruit juice and wine (make it 
more transparent). During the breakdown process, 
a number of different polysaccharides are released, 
which make the juice cloudy, but pectinases break 
these down to make the juice clearer. The sugars 
produced also make the juice sweeter.
Biological washing powders
The majority of commercial enzyme production 
involves protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and 
fat-digesting enzymes (lipases) for use in the food 
and textile industries. When combined in washing 
powders they are effective in removing stains in 
clothes caused by proteins, e.g. blood, egg and gravy, 
and fats, e.g. grease. Protein and fat molecules tend 
to be large and insoluble. When they have been 
digested the products are small, soluble molecules, 
which can pass out of the cloth.

Biological washing powders save energy because  

they can be used to wash clothes at lower temperatures, 
so there is no need to boil water. However, if they 
are put in water at higher temperatures the enzymes 
become denatured (see Chapter 5) and they lose their 
effectiveness.

Practical work

Investigating the use of pectinase 
in fruit juice production
■  Make 100 cm3 of apple purée using a liquidiser, or use a tin of 

apple purée. 

■  Transfer the purée to a 250 cm3 beaker. 
■  Add one level teaspoon of powdered pectinase enzyme (care 

needed – see safety note), stir the mixture and leave it for 
about 5 minutes. 

■  Place a funnel in the top of a 100 cm3 measuring cylinder and 

line the funnel with a folded filter paper. 

■  Transfer the purée into the filter funnel and leave it in a warm 

place for up to 24 hours. 

■  Other measuring cylinders could be set up in the same way, 

with purée left to stand at different temperatures to compare 
the success of juice extraction.

Safety note: Take care to avoid skin or eye contact with the 
enzyme powder. Enzyme powder can cause allergies. Wipe up 
any spillages immediately and rinse the cloth thoroughly with 
water. Do not allow spillages to dry up.

 20  Biotechnology and genetic engineering

Result
Juice is extracted from the purée. It collects in the measuring 
cylinder and is transparent (it has been clarified). 

Interpretation
Pectinase breaks down the apple tissue, releasing sugars in 
solution. More juice collects in the measuring cylinder when the 
purée has been kept in warm conditions; colder temperatures 
slow down the process.

Further investigation
If other enzymes are available, try comparing cellulase and 
amylase with pectinase. Combinations of these could be used 
to find out which is the most effective in extracting the juice. 
Remember to control variables to make a fair comparison.

Investigating the use of biological 
washing powder
■  Break an egg into a plastic beaker and whisk it with a  

fork, spatula or stirring rod until thoroughly mixed. 

■  Cut up four pieces of white cloth to make squares 10 cm × 10 cm, 

smear egg evenly onto each of them and leave to dry. 

■  Set up four 250 cm3 beakers as follows:
  A   100 cm3 warm water, with no washing powder. 
  B   5 cm3 (1 level teaspoon) of non-biological washing powder 

dissolved in 100 cm3 warm water. 

  C   5 cm3 (1 level teaspoon) of biological washing powder 

dissolved in 100 cm3 warm water.

  D   5 cm3 (1 level teaspoon) of biological washing powder 

dissolved in 100 cm3 water and boiled for 5 minutes, then 
left to cool until warm.

■  Place a piece of egg-stained cloth in each beaker and leave for 

30 minutes.

■  Remove the pieces of cloth and compare the effectiveness of 

each washing process. 

Results 
The piece of cloth in beaker C is most effectively cleaned, 
followed by B and then D. The cloth in A is largely unchanged.

Interpretation 
The enzymes in the biological washing powder break down 
the proteins and fats in the egg stain to amino acids and 
fatty acids and glycerol. These are smaller, soluble molecules, 
which can escape from the cloth and dissolve in the water. 
Non-biological washing powder is less effective because it 
does not contain enzymes. Boiled biological washing powder 
is not very effective because the enzymes in it have been 
denatured. Beaker A was a control, with no active detergent 
or enzymes. Soaking the cloth in warm water alone does not 
remove the stain.

Lactose-free milk
Lactose is a type of disaccharide sugar found in 
milk and dairy products. Some people suffer from 
lactose intolerance, a digestive problem where 
the body does not produce enough of the enzyme 
lactase. As a result, the lactose remains in the 
gut, where it is fermented by bacteria, causing 
symptoms such as flatulence (wind), diarrhoea and 
stomach pains. Many foods contain dairy products, 
so people with lactose intolerance cannot eat them, 
or suffer the symptoms described above. However, 
lactose-free milk is now produced using the enzyme 
lactase.

The lactase can be produced on a large scale by 
fermenting yeasts such as Kluyveromyces fragilis or 
fungi such as Aspergillus niger. The fermentation 
process is shown in Figure 20.2.

A simple way to make lactose-free milk is to add 

lactase to milk. The enzyme breaks down lactose 
sugar into two monosaccharide sugars: glucose and 
galactose. Both can be absorbed by the intestine.

An alternative, large-scale method is to immobilise 

lactase on the surface of beads. The milk is then 
passed over the beads and the lactose sugar is 
effectively removed. This method avoids having the 
enzyme molecules in the milk because they remain 
on the beads.

The food industry uses lactase in the production 
of milk products such as yoghurt: it speeds up the 
process and makes the yoghurt taste sweeter.

Practical work

Action of lactase
This investigation uses glucose test strips (diastix). They are used 
by people with diabetes to test for glucose in their urine (see 
‘Homeostasis’ in Chapter 14 for details of diabetes). The strips do 
not react to the presence of other sugars (lactose, sucrose, etc.)

■  Pour 25 cm3 warm, fresh milk into a 100 cm3 beaker. 
■  Test the milk for glucose with a glucose test strip.
■  Measure out 2 cm3 of 2% lactase using a syringe or pipette 

and add this to the milk.

Biotechnology

■  Stir the mixture and leave for a few minutes.
■  Test the milk again with a new glucose test strip.

Result 
Milk gives a negative result for glucose, but milk exposed to 
lactase gives a positive result.

Interpretation 
Lactase breaks down the lactose in milk, as shown in the  
equation below.
 
 
lactose  lactase

 glucose + galactose

Note: milk sometimes contains traces of glucose. If the milk gives 
a positive result with the glucose test strip, an alternative method 
would be to use a solution of lactose instead of milk. However, the 
amount of glucose in the milk, as indicated by the colour change 
on the test strip, should increase after treatment with lactase. 

Antibiotics
When micro-organisms are used for the production 
of antibiotics, it is not their fermentation products 
that are wanted, but complex organic compounds, 
called antibiotics, that they synthesise.

Most of the antibiotics we use come from 

bacteria or fungi that live in the soil. The function 
of the antibiotics in this situation is not clear. One 
theory suggests that the chemicals help to suppress 
competition for limited food resources, but the 
evidence does not support this theory.

One of the most prolific sources of antibiotics 
is Actinomycetes. These are filamentous bacteria 
that resemble microscopic mould fungi. The 
actinomycete Streptomyces produces the antibiotic 
streptomycin.

Perhaps the best known antibiotic is penicillin, 

which is produced by the mould fungus Penicillium 
and was discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 
1928. Penicillin is still an important antibiotic 
but it is produced by mutant forms of a different 
species of Penicillium from that studied by Fleming 
(Figure 20.3). The different mutant forms of the 
fungus produce different types of penicillin. 

The penicillin types are chemically altered in 
the laboratory to make them more effective and 
to ‘tailor’ them for use with different diseases. 
‘Ampicillin’, ‘methicillin’ and ‘oxacillin’ are examples.

Antibiotics attack bacteria in a variety of ways. 

Some of them disrupt the production of the cell wall 
and so prevent the bacteria from reproducing, or 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_20.indd   309

will eventually be scaled up to 10 000-litre fermentation vessels.

even cause them to burst open; some interfere with 
protein synthesis and thus arrest bacterial growth. 
Those that stop bacteria from reproducing are said 
to be bacteriostatic; those that kill the bacteria are 
bacteriocidal.

Animal cells do not have cell walls, and the 

cell structures involved in protein production are 
different. Consequently, antibiotics do not damage 
human cells although they may produce some  
side-effects such as allergic reactions.

Commercial production of penicillin
Antibiotics are produced in giant fermenting 
tanks, up to 100 000 litres in capacity. The tanks 
are filled with a nutrient solution. For penicillin 
production, the carbohydrate source is sugar, mainly 
lactose or ‘corn-steep liquor’ – a by-product of 

309

the manufacture of cornflour and maize starch; it 
contains amino acids as well as sugars. Mineral salts 
are added, the pH is adjusted to between 5 and 6, 
the temperature is maintained at about 26 °C, air 
is blown through the liquid and it is stirred. The 
principles of industrial fermentation are shown in 
Figure 20.2. The nutrient liquid is seeded with a 
culture of the appropriate micro-organism, which is 

●● Genetic engineering

Key definition
Genetic engineering is changing the genetic material of an 

organism by removing, changing or inserting individual genes.

Applications of genetic engineering
The following section gives only a few examples of 
genetic engineering, a rapidly advancing process. Some 
products, such as insulin, are in full-scale production. 
A few genetically modified (GM) crops, e.g. maize 
and soya bean, are being grown on a large scale in the 
USA. Many other projects are still at the experimental 
stage, undergoing trials, awaiting approval by 
regulatory bodies or simply on a ‘wish list’.

Production of human insulin
This hormone can be produced by genetically 
modified bacteria and has been in use since 1982. 
The human insulin gene is inserted into bacteria, 
which then secrete human insulin. The human 
insulin produced in this way (Figure 20.4) is purer 
than insulin prepared from pigs or cattle, which 
sometimes provokes allergic reactions owing to traces 
of ‘foreign’ protein. The GM insulin is acceptable to 
people with a range of religious beliefs who may not 
be allowed to use insulin from cows or pigs. 

GM crops
Genetic engineering has huge potential benefits 
in agriculture but, apart from a relatively small 
range of crop plants, most developments are in the 
experimental or trial stages. In the USA, 50% of the 
soya bean crop and 30% of the maize harvest consist 
of genetically modified plants, which are resistant to 
herbicides and insect pests.

In the UK at the moment, GM crops are grown 
only on a trial basis and there is resistance to their 
growth and the presence of GM products in food.

310

allowed to grow for a day or two. Sterile conditions 
are essential. If ‘foreign’ bacteria or fungi get into the 
system they can completely disrupt the process. As 
the nutrient supply diminishes, the micro-organisms 
begin to secrete their antibiotics into the medium.

The nutrient fluid containing the antibiotic 

is filtered off and the antibiotic extracted by 
crystallisation or other methods.

Figure 20.4  Human insulin prepared from genetically engineered 
bacteria. Though free from foreign proteins, it does not suit  
all patients.

Pest resistance
The bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, produces 
a toxin that kills caterpillars and other insect 
larvae. The toxin has been in use for some years 
as an insecticide. The gene for the toxin has been 
successfully introduced into some plant species using 
a bacterial vector. The plants produce the toxin and 
show increased resistance to attack by insect larvae. 
The gene is also passed on to the plant’s offspring. 
Unfortunately there are signs that insects are 
developing immunity to the toxin.

Most American GM maize, apart from its 

herbicide-resistant gene, also carries a pesticide gene, 
which reduces the damage caused by a stem-boring 
larva of a moth (Figure 20.5).

Figure 20.6  Genetically engineered tomatoes. In the three engineered 
tomatoes on the right, biologists have deleted the gene that produces 
the enzyme which makes fruit go soft.

Inadequate intake of iron is one of the major 
dietary deficiencies (Chapter 7) worldwide. An 
enzyme in some plant roots enables them to extract 
more iron from the soil. The gene for this enzyme 
can be transferred to plants, such as rice, enabling 
them to extract iron from iron-deficient soils.
Over 100 million children in the world are 

deficient in vitamin A. This deficiency often leads 
to blindness. A gene for beta-carotene, a precursor 
of vitamin A, can be inserted into plants to alleviate 
this widespread deficiency. This is not, of course, 
the only way to increase vitamin A availability but it 
could make a significant contribution.

Some acid soils contain levels of aluminium that 

reduce yields of maize by up to 8%. About 40% of soils 
in tropical and subtropical regions have this problem. 
A gene introduced into maize produces citrate, which 
binds the aluminium in the soil and releases phosphate 
ions. After 15 years of trials, the GM maize was made 
available to farmers, but pressure from environmental 
groups has blocked its adoption.

As a result of irrigation, much agricultural land has 
become salty and unproductive. Transferring a gene 
for salt tolerance from, say, mangrove plants to crop 
plants could bring these regions back into production.

If the gene, or genes, for nitrogen fixation 

(Chapter 19) from bacteria or leguminous plants 
could be introduced to cereal crops, yields could be 
increased without the need to add fertilisers.

Similarly, genes for drought resistance would 

make arid areas available for growing crops.

Genes coding for human vaccines have been 

introduced into plants.

Figure 20.5  The maize stem borer can cause considerable losses by 
killing young plants.

Herbicide resistance
Some of the safest and most effective herbicides are 
those, such as glyphosate, which kill any green plant 
but become harmless as soon as they reach the soil. 
These herbicides cannot be used on crops because 
they kill the crop plants as well as the weeds. A gene 
for an enzyme that breaks down glyphosate can be 
introduced into a plant cell culture (Chapter 16). 
This should lead to a reduced use of herbicides.
Modifying plant products
A gene introduced to oilseed rape and other oil-
producing plants can change the nature of the 
oils they produce to make them more suitable for 
commercial processes, e.g. detergent production. 
This might be very important when stocks of 
petroleum run out. It could be a renewable source of 
oil, which would not contribute to global warming 
(see ‘Pollution’ in Chapter 21).

The tomatoes in Figure 20.6 have been modified 

to improve their keeping qualities.

●● Extension work
Other applications of genetic 
engineering
One of the objections to GM crops is that, although 
they show increased yields, this has benefited only 
the farmers and the chemical companies in the 
developed world. So far, genetic engineering has 
done little to improve yields or quality of crops in the 
developing world, except perhaps in China. In fact, 
there are a great many trials in progress, which hold 
out hopes of doing just that. Here are just a few.

Hepatitis B vaccine
The gene for the protein coat of the hepatitis virus 
is inserted into yeast cells. When these are cultured, 
they produce a protein that acts as an antigen (a 
vaccine, Chapter 10) and promotes the production of 
antibodies to the disease.

Transgenic plants have been engineered to 

produce vaccines that can be taken effectively by 
mouth. These include vaccines against rabies and 
cholera. Several species of plant have been used, 
including the banana, which is cheap and widespread 
in the tropics, can be eaten without cooking and 
does not produce seeds (Figure 20.7).

plant might become resistant to herbicides and so 
become a ‘super weed’. The purpose of field trials is 
to assess the likelihood of this happening. Until it is 
established that this is a negligible risk, licences to 
grow GM crops will not be issued.

To prevent the transfer of pollen from GM plants, 

other genes can be introduced, which stop the 
plant from producing pollen and induce the seeds 
and fruits to develop without fertilisation. This is a 
process that occurs naturally in many cultivated and 
wild plants.

Apart from specific hazards, there is also a sense of 
unease about introducing genes from one species into 
a totally different species. This is something that does 
not happen ‘in nature’ and therefore long-term effects 
are not known. In conventional cross-breeding, 
the genes transferred come from the same, or a 
closely related, species. However, in cross-breeding 
the whole raft of genes is transferred and this has 
sometimes had bad results when genes other than 
the target genes have combined to produce harmful 
products. Genetic engineering offers the advantage of 
transferring only those genes that are required.

The differences between the genetic make-up 

of different organisms is not as great as we tend to 
think. Plants and animals share 60% of their genes 
and humans have 50% of their genes in common 
with fruit flies. Not all genetic engineering involves 
transfer of ‘alien’ genes. In some cases it is the 
plant’s own genes that are modified to improve its 
success in the field.

At least some of the protests against GM crops 

may be ill-judged (Figure 20.8).

It is important to ensure that plants engineered to produce 

Figure 20.7 
drugs and vaccines cannot find their way, by chance, into the human 
food chain. Strict control measures have to be applied.

Possible hazards of GM crops
One of the possible harmful effects of planting GM 
crops is that their modified genes might get into 
wild plants. If a gene for herbicide resistance found 
its way, via pollination, into a ‘weed’ plant, this

Ill-judged protest. These vandalised poplars carried a

gene that softened the cell walls, reducing the need for environmentally 
damaging chemicals used in paper making. They were also all female 
plants so no pollen could have been produced.

Use of bacteria and restriction 
enzymes in genetic engineering
To understand the principles of genetic engineering 
you need to know something about bacteria 
(Figure 1.29) and restriction enzymes.

Bacteria are microscopic single-celled organisms with 

cytoplasm, cell membranes and cell walls, but without 
a proper nucleus. Genetic control in a bacterium is 
exercised by a double strand of deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) in the form of a circle, but not enclosed in a 
nuclear membrane. This circular DNA strand carries 
the genes that control bacterial metabolism.

In addition, there are present in the cytoplasm 
a number of small, circular pieces of DNA called 
plasmids. The plasmids often carry genes that give 
the bacterium resistance to particular antibiotics such 
as tetracycline and ampicillin.

Restriction enzymes are produced by bacteria. 
They ‘cut’ DNA molecules at specific sites, e.g. 
between the A and the T in the sequence GAA–TTC. 
Restriction enzymes can be extracted from bacteria 
and purified. By using a selected restriction enzyme, 
DNA molecules extracted from different organisms 
can be cut at predictable sites and made to produce 
lengths of DNA that contain specific genes.

DNA from human cells can be extracted and 

restriction enzymes used to ‘cut’ out a sequence of 
DNA that includes a gene, e.g. the gene for production 
of insulin (Figure 20.9). These lengths have sticky ends. 
Plasmids are extracted from bacteria and ‘cut open’ 
with the same restriction enzyme. If the human DNA 
is then added to a suspension of the plasmids, some of 
the human DNA will attach to some of the plasmids 
by their sticky ends, and the plasmids will then close up 
again, given suitable enzymes such as ligase. The DNA 
in these plasmids is called recombinant DNA.
The bacteria can be induced to take up the 

plasmids and, by ingenious culture methods using 
antibiotics, it is possible to select the bacteria that 
contain the recombinant DNA. The human DNA 
in the plasmids continues to produce the same 
protein as it did in the human cells. In the example 
mentioned, this would be the protein, insulin 
(Chapter 14). The plasmids are said to be the 
vectors that carry the human DNA into the bacteria 
and the technique is sometimes called gene-splicing.
Given suitable nutrient solutions, bacteria multiply 

rapidly and produce vast numbers of offspring. The 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_20.indd   313

genetic engineering

bacteria reproduce by mitosis (Chapter 17) and so 
each daughter bacterium will contain the same DNA 
and the same plasmids as the parent. The offspring 
form a clone and the insulin gene is said to be cloned 
by this method.

The bacteria are cultured in special vessels called 
fermenters (Figure 20.2) and the insulin that they 
produce can be extracted from the culture medium 
and purified for use in treating diabetes (Chapter 14).

 20  Biotechnology and genetic engineering

This is only one type of genetic engineering. The 
vector may be a virus rather than a plasmid; the 
DNA may be inserted directly, without a vector; the 
donor DNA may be synthesised from nucleotides 
rather than extracted from cells; yeast may be used 
instead of bacteria. The outcome, however, is the 
same. DNA from one species is inserted into a 
different species and made to produce its normal 
proteins (Figure 20.9).

In the example shown in Figure 20.9, the gene 

product, insulin, is harvested and used to treat 
diabetes. In other cases, genes are inserted into 
organisms to promote changes that may be benefi cial. 
Bacteria or viruses are used as vectors to deliver the 
genes. For example, a bacterium is used to deliver a 
gene for herbicide resistance in crop plants.

 GM food
This is food prepared from GM crops. Most genetic 
modifi cations are aimed at increasing yields rather 
than changing the quality of food. However, it is 
possible to improve the protein, mineral or vitamin 
content of food and the keeping qualities of some 
products (Figure 20.6).

 Possible hazards of GM food
One of the worries is that the vectors for 
delivering recombinant DNA contain genes 
for antibiotic resistance. The antibiotic-
resistant properties are used to select only those 
vectors that have taken up the new DNA. If, 
in the intestine, the DNA managed to get into 

potentially harmful bacteria, it might make them 
resistant to antibiotic drugs.

Although there is no evidence to suggest this 

happens in experimental animals, the main biotech 
companies are trying to fi nd methods of selecting 
vectors without using antibiotics.

Another concern is that GM food could contain 
pesticide residues or substances that cause allergies 
(allergens). However, it has to be said that all 
GM products are rigorously tested for toxins and 
allergens over many years, far more so than any 
products from conventional cross-breeding. The GM 
products have to be passed by a series of regulatory 
and advisory bodies before they are released on to 
the market. In fact only a handful of GM foods are 
available. One of these is soya, which is included, in 
one form or another, in 60% of processed foods.

Golden rice was a variety of rice developed 

through genetic engineering to carry a gene that is 
responsible for making beta-carotene, a precursor of 
vitamin A. In countries where rice is a staple food, 
the use of golden rice could reduce the incidence 
of a condition called night blindness – a serious 
problem which is estimated to kill 670 000 children 
under the age of 5 each year.

However, some argue that there is a danger of the 
precursor changing into other, toxic chemicals once 
eaten. There were also concerns about a reduction 
in biodiversity as a result of the introduction of GM 
species. Subsistence farmers could also be tied to 
large agricultural suppliers who may then manipulate 
seed prices.

Checklist
After studying Chapter 20 you should know and understand the 
following:

Biotechnology and genetic engineering

•  Fermenters are used in the production of penicillin.
•  Enzymes from micro-organisms can be produced on an 

industrial scale and used in other biotechnology processes.

•  Sterile conditions are essential in biotechnology to avoid 

contamination by unwanted microbes.

•  Bacteria are useful in biotechnology and genetic engineering 
because of their ability to make complex molecules and their 
rapid reproduction.

Genetic engineering

•  Bacteria are useful in biotechnology and genetic 

engineering because of lack of ethical concerns over their 
manipulation and growth.

•  The genetic code in bacteria is shared with all other 

organisms.

•  Bacteria contain DNA in the form of plasmids, which can 

be cut open to insert genes.

Biotechnology

•  Biotechnology is the application of living organisms, systems 

or processes in industry.

•  Many biotechnological processes use micro-organisms 

(fungi and bacteria) to bring about the reactions.

•  Most biotechnological processes are classed as 

‘fermentations’.

•  Fermentation may be aerobic or anaerobic.
•  The required product of biotechnology may be the organism 
itself (e.g. mycoprotein) or one of its products (e.g. alcohol).

•  Yeasts produce ethanol by anaerobic respiration. The ethanol 

can be produced commercially for biofuel.

•  Anaerobic respiration by yeast is also involved in bread-

making.

•  Pectinase can be used to extract fruit juices.
•  Lipase and protease enzymes are used in biological washing 

powders to remove fat and protein stains.

•  Lactase is used to produce lactose-free milk.
•  Antibiotics are produced from bacteria and fungi.
•  The fungus Penicillium is used in the production of the 

antibiotic penicillin.

•  Genetic engineering is changing the genetic material of 

an organism by removing, changing or inserting individual 
genes.

•  Examples of genetic engineering include: 

–  the insertion of humans genes into bacteria to produce 

human insulin

–  the insertion of genes into crop plants to confer resistance 

to herbicides or insect pests

–  the insertion of genes into crop plants to provide 

additional vitamins.

•  Plasmids and viruses are vectors used to deliver the genes.
•  Genetic engineering is used in the production of enzymes, 

hormones and drugs.

•  Crop plants can be genetically modified to resist insect pests 

and herbicides.

•  There is concern that the genes introduced into crop plants 

might spread to wild plants.

•  Genetic engineering can use bacteria to produce human 

protein, such as insulin.

•  Human gene DNA is isolated using restriction enzymes, 

forming sticky ends.

•  Bacterial plasmid DNA is cut with same restriction 

enzymes, forming matching sticky ends.

•  Human gene DNA is inserted into the bacterial plasmid 
DNA using DNA ligase to form a recombinant plasmid.

•  The plasmid is inserted into bacteria.
•  The bacteria containing the recombinant plasmid are 

replicated. 

•  They make a human protein as they express the gene.
•  There are advantages and disadvantages of genetically 

modifying crops, such as soya, maize and rice.

●● Food supply
A few thousand years ago, most of the humans on the 
Earth obtained their food by gathering leaves, fruits 
or roots and by hunting animals. The population was 
probably limited by the amount of food that could be 
collected in this way.

Human faeces, urine and dead bodies were left 

on or in the soil and so played a part in the nitrogen 
cycle (Chapter 19). Life may have been short, and 
many babies may have died from starvation or illness, 
but humans fi tted into the food web and nitrogen 
cycle like any other animal.

Once agriculture had been developed, it was possible 

to support much larger populations and the balance 
between humans and their environment was upset.

Intensifi cation of agriculture
Forests and woodland are cut down in order to grow 
more food. This destroys important wildlife habitats 
and may affect the climate. Tropical rainforest 
is being cut down at the rate of 111 400 square 
kilometres per year. Since 1950, between 30 and 50% 
of British deciduous woodlands have been felled to 
make way for farmland or conifer plantations.

Modern agricultural machinery is used to clear 

the land, prepare the soil and plant, maintain and 

harvest crops to improve effi ciency. To make the 
process even more effi cient, fi elds are made larger by 
taking out hedges (Figure 21.1). 

Figure 21.1  Destruction of a hedgerow. Permission now has to be 
sought from the local authority before this can happen. Grants are 
available in some countries to replant hedges.

Larger vehicles such as tractors (see Figure 21.6) 
and combine harvesters (see Figure 21.5) can 
then be used in the fi elds to speed up the farming 
processes. However, studies have shown that repeated 
ploughing of a pasture reduces the number of species 
in the soil.

The use of chemical fertilisers to 
improve yield
In a natural community of plants and animals, the 
processes that remove and replace mineral elements 
in the soil are in balance. In agriculture, most of the 
crop is usually removed so that there is little or no 
organic matter for nitrifying bacteria to act on. In a 
farm with animals, the animal manure, mixed with 
straw, is ploughed back into the soil or spread on the 
pasture. The manure thus replaces the nitrates and 
other minerals removed by the crop. It also gives the 
soil a good structure and improves its water-holding 
properties.

When animal manure is not available in large 

enough quantities, chemical fertilisers are used. These 
are mineral salts made on an industrial scale. Examples 
are ammonium sulfate (for nitrogen and sulfur), 
ammonium nitrate (for nitrogen) and compound NPK 
fertiliser for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. 
These are spread on the soil in carefully calculated 
amounts to provide the minerals, particularly nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium, which the plants need. 
These artificial fertilisers increase the yield of crops 
from agricultural land, but they do little to maintain 
a good soil structure because they contain no organic 
matter (Figures 21.2 and 21.3). In some cases, their 
use results in the pollution of rivers and streams 
(see ‘Pollution’ later in this chapter).
Monoculture
The whole point of crop farming is to remove a mixed 
population of trees, shrubs, wild flowers and grasses 
(Figure 21.4) and replace it with a dense population of 
only one species such as wheat or beans (Figure 21.5). 
When a crop of a single species is grown on the same 
land, year after year, it is called a monoculture.

Figure 21.6  Weed control by herbicide spraying. A young wheat crop is 
sprayed with herbicide to suppress weeds.

The negative impact of monocultures
In a monoculture, every attempt is made to destroy 
organisms that feed on, compete with or infect the 
crop plant. So, the balanced life of a natural plant and 
animal community is displaced from farmland and left 
to survive only in small areas of woodland, heath or 
hedgerow. We have to decide on a balance between 
the amount of land to be used for agriculture and 
the amount of land left alone in order to keep a rich 
variety of wildlife on the Earth’s surface.
Pesticides: insecticides and herbicides
Monocultures, with their dense populations of single 
species and repeated planting, are very susceptible 
to attack by insects or the spread of fungus diseases. 
To combat these threats, pesticides are used. A 
pesticide is a chemical that destroys agricultural pests 
or competitors.

For a monoculture to be maintained, plants that 

compete with the crop plant for root space, soil 
minerals and sunlight are killed by chemicals called 
herbicides (Figures 21.6 and 21.7). To destroy 
insects that eat and damage the plants, the crops are 
sprayed with insecticides.

The trouble with most pesticides is that they kill 
indiscriminately. Insecticides, for example, kill not 
only harmful insects but the harmless and beneficial 
ones, such as bees, which pollinate flowering plants, 
and ladybirds, which eat aphids.

Figure 21.7  Effect of a herbicide spray. The crop has been sprayed 
except for a strip which the tractor driver missed.

In about 1960, a group of chemicals, including 
aldrin and dieldrin, were used as insecticides to kill 
wireworms and other insect pests in the soil. However, 
aldrin was found to reduce the number of species of 
soil animals in a pasture to half the original number 
(Figure 21.8). Dieldrin was also used as a seed 
dressing. If seeds were dipped in the chemical before 
planting, it prevented certain insects from attacking 
the seedlings. This was thought to be better than 
spraying the soil with dieldrin, which would have killed 
all the insects in the soil. Unfortunately pigeons, rooks, 
pheasants and partridges dug up and ate so much of 
the seed that the dieldrin poisoned them. Thousands 
of these birds were poisoned and, because they were 
part of a food web, birds of prey and foxes, which 
fed on them, were also killed. The use of dieldrin and 
aldrin was restricted in 1981 and banned in 1992.

Food supply

One alternative to pesticides is the use of biological 
control, though this also is not without its 
drawbacks unless it is thoroughly researched and 
tested. It may involve the introduction of foreign 
species, which could interfere with food chains and 
webs (see Chapter 19).
Selective breeding
An important part of any breeding programme is 
the selection of the desired varieties. The largest 
fruit on a tomato plant might be picked and its 
seeds planted next year. In the next generation, 
once again only seeds from the largest tomatoes are 
planted. Eventually it is possible to produce a true-
breeding variety of tomato plant that forms large 
fruits. Figure 18.25 shows the result of such selective 
breeding for different characteristics. The same 
technique can be used for selecting other desirable 
qualities, such as flavour and disease resistance.

Similar principles can be applied to farm animals. 

Desirable characteristics, such as high milk yield 
and resistance to disease, may be combined. Stock-
breeders will select calves from cows that give 
large quantities of milk. These calves will be used 
as breeding stock to build a herd of high yielders. 
A characteristic such as milk yield is probably 
under the control of many genes. At each stage of 
selective breeding the farmer, in effect, is keeping the 
beneficial genes and discarding the less useful genes 
from his or her animals.

Selective breeding in farm stock can be slow and 

expensive because the animals often have small 
numbers of offspring and breed only once a year.
One of the drawbacks of selective breeding is 

that the whole set of genes is transferred. As well as 
the desirable genes, there may be genes which, in 
a homozygous condition, would be harmful. It is 

known that artificial selection repeated over a large 
number of generations tends to reduce the fitness of 
the new variety (Chapter 18).

A long-term disadvantage of selective breeding is the 

loss of variability. By eliminating all the offspring who 
do not bear the desired characteristics, many genes are 
lost from the population. At some future date, when 
new combinations of genes are sought, some of the 
potentially useful ones may no longer be available.

In attempting to introduce, in plants, 

characteristics such as salt tolerance or resistance to 
disease or drought, the plant breeder goes back to 
wild varieties, as shown in Figure 18.26. However, 
with the current rate of extinction, this source of 
genetic material is diminishing.

In the natural world, reduction of variability could 
lead to local extinction if the population was unable 
to adapt, by natural selection, to changing conditions.

The negative impacts of intensive 
livestock production
Intensive livestock production is also known as 
‘factory farming’. Chickens (Figure 19.13) and calves 
are often reared in large sheds instead of in open 
fields. Their urine and faeces are washed out of the 
sheds with water forming ‘slurry’. If this slurry gets 
into streams and rivers it supplies an excess of nitrates 
and phosphates for the microscopic algae. This starts 
a chain of events, which can lead to eutrophication 
of the water system (see later in this chapter). 

Overgrazing can result if too many animals are 
kept on a pasture. They eat the grass down almost 
to the roots, and their hooves trample the surface 
soil into a hard layer. As a result, the rainwater will not 
penetrate the soil so it runs off the surface, carrying 
the soil with it. The soil becomes eroded.

The problems of world food 
supplies
There is not always enough food available in a 
country to feed the people living there. A severe 
food shortage can lead to famine. Food may 
have to be brought in (imported). Fresh food 
can have a limited storage life, so it needs to be 
transported quickly or treated to prevent it going 
rotten. Methods to increase the life of food include 
transport in chilled containers, or picking the 

produce before it is ripe. When it has reached its 
destination, it is exposed to chemicals such as plant 
auxins to bring on the ripening process. The use of 
aeroplanes to transport food is very expensive. The 
redistribution of food from first world countries to 
a poorer one can have a detrimental effect on that 
country’s local economy by reducing the value of 
food grown by local farmers. Some food grown by 
countries with large debts may be exported as cash 
crops, even though the local people desperately need 
the food.

 21  Human inFluences on ecosystems

Other problems that can result in famine include:

• climate change and natural disasters such as 

flooding (caused by excessive rainfall or tsunamis) 
or drought; waterlogged soil can become infertile 
due to the activities of denitrifying bacteria, which 
break down nitrates 

• pollution
• shortage of water through its use for other 

purposes, the diversion of rivers, building dams to 
provide hydroelectricity

• eating next year’s seeds through desperation for 

food

• poor soil, lack of inorganic ions or fertiliser
• desertification due to soil erosion as a result of 

deforestation

• lack of money to buy seeds, fertiliser, pesticides or 

machinery

• war, which can make it too dangerous to farm, or 

which removes labour

• urbanisation (building on farmland); the 

development of towns and cities makes less and 
less land available for farmland

• an increasing population
• pest damage or disease
• poor education of farmers and outmoded farming 

practices

• the destruction of forests, so there is nothing to 

hunt and no food to collect

• use of farmland to grow cash crops, or plants for 

biofuel.

●● Habitat destruction
Removal of habitats
Farmland is not a natural habitat but, at one time, 
hedgerows, hay meadows and stubble fields were 
important habitats for plants and animals. Hay 
meadows and hedgerows supported a wide range of 
wild plants as well as providing feeding and nesting 
sites for birds and animals.

Intensive agriculture has destroyed many of 

these habitats; hedges have been grubbed out (see 
Figure 21.1) to make fields larger, a monoculture of 
silage grasses (Figure 21.9) has replaced the mixed 
population of a hay meadow (Figure 21.10) and 
planting of winter wheat has denied animals access 
to stubble fields in autumn. As a result, populations 
of butterflies, flowers and birds such as skylarks, 
grey partridges, corn buntings and tree sparrows 
have crashed.

Recent legislation now prohibits the removal of 

hedgerows without approval from the local authority 
but the only hedges protected in this way are those 
deemed to be ‘important’ because of species diversity 
or historical significance.

In Britain, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory 
Group (FWAG) can advise farmers how to manage 
their land in ways that encourage wildlife. This 
includes, for example, leaving strips of uncultivated 
land around the margins of fields or planting new 
hedgerows. Even strips of wild grasses and flowers 

between fields significantly increase the population of 
beneficial insects.

The development of towns and cities (urbanisation) 

makes a great demand on land, destroying natural 
habitats. In addition, the crowding of growing 
populations into towns leads to problems of waste 
disposal. The sewage and domestic waste from a town 
of several thousand people can cause disease and 
pollution in the absence of effective means of disposal, 
damaging surrounding habitats.
Extraction of natural resources
An increasing population and greater demands 
on modern technology means we need more raw 
materials for the manufacturing industry and greater 
energy supplies.

Fossil fuels such as coal can be mined, but this 

can permanently damage habitats, partly due to the 
process of extraction, but also due to dumping of the 
rock extracted in spoil heaps. Some methods of coal 
extraction involve scraping off existing soil from the 
surface of the land. Spoil heaps created from waste rock 
can contain toxic metals, which prevent re-colonisation 
of the land. Open-pit mining puts demands on local 
water sources, affecting habitats in lakes and rivers. 
Water can become contaminated with toxic metals 
from the mining site, damaging aquatic habitats.

Oil spillages around oil wells are extremely toxic. 
Once the oil seeps into the soil and water systems, 
habitats are destroyed (Figure 21.11)

Habitat destruction

Mining for raw materials such as gold, iron 
aluminium and silicon leaves huge scars in the 
landscape and destroys large areas of natural habitat 
(Figure 21.12). The extraction of sand and gravel 
also leaves large pits that prevent previous habitats 
redeveloping.

Figure 21.12  Open-pit gold mine in New Zealand

In response to this increased human activity, in 1982 
the United Nations developed the World Charter 
for Nature. This was followed in 1990 by The 
World Ethic of Sustainability, created by the World 
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the International 
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). 
Included in this charter were habitat conservation 
and the need to protect natural resources from 
depletion.

Marine pollution
Marine habitats around the world are becoming 
contaminated with human debris. This includes 
untreated sewage, agricultural fertilisers and 
pesticides. Oil spills still cause problems, but this 
source of marine pollution is gradually reducing. 
Plastics are a huge problem: many are non-
biodegradable so they persist in the environment. 
Others form micro-particles as they break down and 
these are mistaken by marine organisms for food and 
are indigestible. They stay in the stomach, causing 
sickness, or prevent the gills from working efficiently. 
Where fertilisers and sewage enter the marine 
environment, ‘dead zones’ develop where there 
is insufficient oxygen to sustain life. This destroys 
habitats (see next section).

 21  Human inFluences on ecosystems

Oil spills wash up on the intertidal zone, killing 

the seaweeds that provide nutrients for food chains. 
Filter-feeding animals such as barnacles and some 
species of mollusc die from taking in the oil (see 
Figure 1.8). 

Any form of habitat destruction by humans, even 

where a single species is wiped out, can have an 
impact on food chains and food webs because other 
organisms will use that species as a food source, 
or their numbers will be controlled through its 
predation.
Deforestation
The removal of large numbers of trees results in 
habitat destruction on a massive scale. 

●  Animals living in the forest lose their homes and 
sources of food; species of plant become extinct 
as the land is used for other purposes such as 
agriculture, mining, housing and roads. 

●  Soil erosion is more likely to happen as there are no 
roots to hold the soil in place. The soil can end up 
in rivers and lakes, destroying habitats there.

● Flooding becomes more frequent as there is no 

soil to absorb and hold rainwater. Plant roots rot 
and animals drown, destroying food chains and 
webs.

● Carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere 

as there are fewer trees to photosynthesise, 
increasing global warming. Climate change affects 
habitats.

The undesirable effects of 
deforestation on the environment
Forests have a profound effect on climate, water 
supply and soil maintenance. They have been 
described as environmental buffers. For example, 
they intercept heavy rainfall and release the water 
steadily and slowly to the soil beneath and to the 
streams and rivers that start in or flow through them. 
The tree roots hold the soil in place.

At present, we are destroying forests, particularly 
tropical forests, at a rapid rate (1) for their timber, 
(2) to make way for agriculture, roads (Figure 21.13) 
and settlements, and (3) for firewood. The Food and 
Agriculture Organisation, run by the United Nations, 
reported that the overall tropical deforestation rates 
in the decade up to 2010 were 8.5% higher than 
during the 1990s. At the current rate of destruction, 
it is estimated that all tropical rainforests will have 
disappeared in the next 75 years. 

Removal of forests allows soil erosion, silting up 

of lakes and rivers, floods and the loss for ever of 
thousands of species of animals and plants.

Trees can grow on hillsides even when the soil 
layer is quite thin. When the trees are cut down 
and the soil is ploughed, there is less protection 
from the wind and rain. Heavy rainfall washes the 
soil off the hillsides into the rivers. The hillsides are 
left bare and useless and the rivers become choked 

up with mud and silt, which can cause floods 
(Figures 21.14 and 21.15). For example, Argentina 
spends 10 million dollars a year on dredging silt 
from the River Plate estuary to keep the port of 
Buenos Aires open to shipping. It has been found 
that 80% of this sediment comes from a deforested 
and overgrazed region 1800 km upstream, which 
represents only 4% of the river’s total catchment 
area. Similar sedimentation has halved the lives of 
reservoirs, hydroelectric schemes and irrigation 
programmes. The disastrous floods in India and 
Bangladesh in recent years may be attributed largely 
to deforestation.

not only destroys the natural vegetation, it also opens up the forest to 
further exploitation.

Habitat destruction

Forests and climate
About half the rain that falls in tropical forests 
comes from the transpiration of the trees 
themselves. The clouds that form from this 
transpired water help to reflect sunlight and so keep 
the region relatively cool and humid. When areas 
of forest are cleared, this source of rain is removed, 
cloud cover is reduced and the local climate 
changes quite dramatically. The temperature range 
from day to night is more extreme and the rainfall 
diminishes.

In North Eastern Brazil, for example, an area 

which was once rainforest is now an arid wasteland. 
If more than 60% of a forest is cleared, it may 
cause irreversible changes in the climate of the 
whole region. This could turn the region into an 
unproductive desert.

Removal of trees on such a large scale 

also reduces the amount of carbon dioxide 
removed from the atmosphere in the process of 
photosynthesis (see ‘Nutrient cycles’, Chapter 19, 
and ‘Photosynthesis’, Chapter 6). Most scientists 
agree that the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere 
contributes to global warming. 

Figure 21.14  Soil erosion. Removal of forest trees from steeply sloping 
ground has allowed the rain to wash away the topsoil.

The soil of tropical forests is usually very poor in 
nutrients. Most of the organic matter is in the leafy 
canopy of the tree tops. For a year or two after 
felling and burning, the forest soil yields good crops 
but the nutrients are soon depleted and the soil 
eroded. The agricultural benefit from cutting down 
forests is very short-lived, and the forest does not 
recover even if the impoverished land is abandoned.

Forests and biodiversity
One of the most characteristic features of tropical 
rainforests is the enormous diversity of species they 
contain. In Britain, a forest or wood may consist 
of only one or two species of tree such as oak, 
ash, beech or pine. In tropical forests there are 
many more species and they are widely dispersed 
throughout the habitat. It follows that there is 
also a wide diversity of animals that live in such 
habitats. In fact, it has been estimated that half 
of the world’s 10 million species live in tropical 
forests.

Destruction of tropical forest, therefore, destroys 
a large number of different species, driving many of 
them to the verge of extinction, and also drives out 
the indigenous populations of humans. In addition, 
we may be depriving ourselves of many valuable 
sources of chemical compounds that the plants and 

animals produce. The US National Cancer Institute 
has identified 3000 plants having products active 
against cancer cells and 70% of them come from 
rainforests (Figure 21.16).

●● Pollution
Insecticides
The effects of the insecticides aldrin and dieldrin 
were discussed earlier in this chapter. Most insecticide 
pollution is as a result of their use in agriculture. 
However, one pesticide, called DDT, was used to 
control the spread of malaria by killing mosquitos, 
which carry the protoctist parasites that cause 
the disease. Unfortunately, DDT remains in the 
environment after it has been sprayed and can 
be absorbed in sub-lethal doses by microscopic 
organisms. Hence, it can enter food chains and 
accumulate as it moves up them. 

The concentration of insecticide often increases 

as it passes along a food chain (Figure 21.17). Clear 
Lake in California was sprayed with DDT to kill gnat 
larvae. The insecticide made only a weak solution of 
0.015 parts per million (ppm) in the lake water. The 
microscopic plants and animals that fed in the lake 
water built up concentrations of about 5 ppm in their 
bodies. The small fish that fed on the microscopic 
animals had 10 ppm. The small fish were eaten by 
larger fish, which in turn were eaten by birds called 
grebes. The grebes were found to have 1600 ppm of 
DDT in their body fat and this high concentration 
killed large numbers of them.

Larger scale pollution of water by insecticides, for 
instance by leakage from storage containers, may kill 
aquatic insects, destroying one or more levels in a 
food chain or food web, with serious consequences to 
the ecosystem.

A build-up of pesticides can also occur in food 

chains on land. In the 1950s in the USA, DDT 
was sprayed on to elm trees to try and control 
the beetle that spread Dutch elm disease. The 
fallen leaves, contaminated with DDT, were eaten 
by earthworms. Because each worm ate many 
leaves, the DDT concentration in their bodies was 
increased ten times. When birds ate a large number 
of worms, the concentration of DDT in the birds’ 
bodies reached lethal proportions and there was a 
30–90% mortality among robins and other song 
birds in the cities.

Even if DDT did not kill the birds, it caused them 

to lay eggs with thin shells. The eggs broke easily 
and fewer chicks were raised. In Britain, the numbers 
of peregrine falcons and sparrow hawks declined 
drastically between 1955 and 1965. These birds are 
at the top of a food web and so accumulate very high 
doses of the pesticides that are present in their prey, 
such as pigeons. After the use of DDT was restricted, 
the population of peregrines and sparrow hawks 
started to recover.

Figure 21.17  Pesticides may become more concentrated as they move along a food chain. The intensity of colour represents the concentration of DDT.

These new insecticides had been thoroughly tested 
in the laboratory to show that they were harmless 
to humans and other animals when used in low 
concentrations. It had not been foreseen that 
the insecticides would become more and more 
concentrated as they passed along the food chain.

Insecticides like this are called persistent because 

they last a long time without breaking down. This 
makes them good insecticides but they also persist 
for a long time in the soil, in rivers, lakes and the 
bodies of animals, including humans. This is a serious 
disadvantage.
Herbicides
Herbicides are used by farmers to control plants 
(usually referred to as weeds) that compete with crop 
plants for nutrients, water and light (see Figure 21.7). 
If the weeds are not removed, crop productivity is 
reduced. However, if the herbicides do not break 
down straight away, they can leach from farmland 
into water systems such as rivers and lakes, where 
they can kill aquatic plants, removing the producers 
from food chains. Herbivores lose their food source 
and die or migrate. Carnivorous animals are then 
affected as well.

Leakage or dumping of persistent herbicides into 

the sea can have a similar effect on marine food 
chains.

Herbicides tend to be non-specific: they kill 
any broadleaved plants they come into contact 

with or are absorbed by. If herbicides are sprayed 
indiscriminately, they may blow onto surrounding 
land and kill plants other than the weeds in the 
crop being treated. This can put rare species of wild 
flowers at risk.
Nuclear fall-out 
This can be the result of a leak from a nuclear power 
station, or from a nuclear explosion. Radioactive 
particles are carried by the wind or water and 
gradually settle in the environment. If the radiation 
has a long half-life, it remains in the environment 
and is absorbed by living organisms. The radioactive 
material bioaccumulates in food chains and can cause 
cancer in top carnivores. 

Probably the worst nuclear accident in history 
happened at Chernobyl in Russia in April 1986. 
One of the reactor vessels exploded and the 
resulting fire produced a cloud of radioactive 
fallout, which was carried by prevailing winds 
over other parts of the Soviet Union and Europe. 
The predicted death toll, from direct exposure to 
the radiation and indirectly from the fallout, is 
estimated to be at least 4000 people (and possibly 
much higher), with many others suffering from 
birth defects or cancers associated with exposure 
to radiation. The fall-out contaminated the soil 
it fell on and was absorbed by plants, which were 
grazed by animals. Farmers in the Lake District 
in England were still banned from selling sheep

for meat until June 2012, 26 years after the 
contamination of land there first happened.

Another major nuclear disaster happened at 
the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 
March 2011 (Figure 21.18). The plant was hit by 
a powerful tsunami, caused by an earthquake. A 
plume of radioactive material was carried from the 
site by the wind and came down onto the land, 
forming a scar like a teardrop over 30 kilometres 
wide. The sea around the power plant is heavily 
contaminated by radiation. This is absorbed 
into fish bones, making the animals unfit for 
consumption.

Figure 21.18  Fukushima nuclear power plant, destroyed by a 
powerful tsunami and fire

Chemical waste
Many industrial processes produce poisonous waste 
products. Electroplating, for example, produces 
waste containing copper and cyanide. If these 
chemicals are released into rivers they poison the 
animals and plants and could poison humans who 
drink the water. It is estimated that the River Trent 
receives 850 tonnes of zinc, 4000 tonnes of nickel 
and 300 tonnes of copper each year from industrial 
processes. 
Any factory getting rid of its effluent into 
water systems risks damaging the environment 
(Figure 21.19). Some detergents contain a lot 
of phosphate. This is not removed by sewage 
treatment and is discharged into rivers. The large 
amount of phosphate encourages growth of 
microscopic plants (algae).

326

Figure 21.19  River pollution. The river is badly polluted by the effluent 
from a paper mill.

In 1971, 45 people in Minamata Bay in Japan died 
and 120 were seriously ill as a result of mercury 
poisoning. It was found that a factory had been 
discharging a compound of mercury into the bay as 
part of its waste. Although the mercury concentration 
in the sea was very low, its concentration was 
increased as it passed through the food chain (see 
Figure 21.17). By the time it reached the people of 
Minamata Bay in the fish and other sea food that 
formed a large part of their diet, it was concentrated 
enough to cause brain damage, deformity and death.

High levels of mercury have also been detected 
in the Baltic Sea and in the Great Lakes of North 
America.

Oil pollution of the sea has become a familiar 

event. In 1989, a tanker called the Exxon Valdez ran 
on to Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 
and 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the 
sea. Around 400 000 sea birds were killed by the 
oil (Figure 21.20) and the populations of killer 
whales, sea otters and harbour seals among others, 
were badly affected. The hot water high-pressure 
hosing techniques and chemicals used to clean up the 
shoreline killed many more birds and sea creatures 
living on the coast. Since 1989, there have continued 
to be major spillages of crude oil from tankers and 
off-shore oil wells.
Discarded rubbish
The development of towns and cities, and the 
crowding of growing populations into them, leads to 
problems of waste disposal. The domestic waste from 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_21.indd   326

Pollution

a town of several thousand people can cause disease 
and pollution in the absence of effective means of 
disposal. Much ends up in landfill sites, taking up 
valuable space, polluting the ground and attracting 
vermin and insects, which can spread disease. Most 
consumable items come in packaging, which, if not 
recycled, ends up in landfill sites or is burned, causing 
air pollution. Discarded rubbish that ends up in the 
sea can cause severe problems for marine animals.

Figure 21.20  Oil pollution. Oiled sea birds like this long-tailed duck 
cannot fly to reach their feeding grounds. They also poison themselves 
by trying to clean the oil from their feathers.

Sewage
Diseases like typhoid and cholera are caused by 
certain bacteria when they get into the human 
intestine. The faeces passed by people suffering from 
these diseases will contain the harmful bacteria. If 
the bacteria get into drinking water they may spread 
the disease to hundreds of other people. For this 
reason, among others, untreated sewage must not be 
emptied into rivers. It is treated at the sewage works 
so that all the solids are removed. The human waste 
is broken down by bacteria and made harmless (free 
from harmful bacteria and poisonous chemicals), 
but the breakdown products include phosphates and 
nitrates. When the water from the sewage treatment 
is discharged into rivers it contains large quantities of 
phosphate and nitrate, which allow the microscopic 
plant life to grow very rapidly (Figure 21.21).

Figure 21.21  Growth of algae in a lake. Abundant nitrate and phosphate 
from treated sewage and from farmland make this growth possible.

Fertilisers
When nitrates and phosphates from farmland and 
sewage escape into water they cause excessive growth 
of microscopic green plants. This may result in 
a serious oxygen shortage in the water, resulting 
in the death of aquatic animals – a process called 
eutrophication.

Eutrophication
Nitrates and phosphates are present from a number 
of sources, including untreated sewage, detergents 
from manufacturing and washing processes, arable 
farming and factory farming.

If these nitrates or phosphates enter a water 

system, they become available for algae (aquatic 
plants) to absorb. The plants need these nutrients 
to grow. More nutrients result in faster growth 
(Figure 21.21). As the plants die, some through 
lack of light because of overcrowding, aerobic 
bacteria decompose them and respire, taking 
oxygen out of the water. As oxygen levels 
drop, animals such as fish cannot breathe, so 
they die and the whole ecosystem is destroyed 
(Figure 21.22).

●  increasing numbers of animals (including humans) 

– they all respire.

An increase in levels of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere is thought to contribute to global 
warming. Carbon dioxide forms a layer in the 
atmosphere, which traps heat radiation from 
the Sun. 

Methane also acts as a greenhouse gas. Its levels 

in the atmosphere have more than doubled over the 
past 200 years and its effects on global warming are 
much greater than carbon dioxide. It is produced by 
the decay of organic matter in anaerobic conditions, 
such as in wet rice fields and in the stomachs of 
animals, e.g. cattle and termites. It is also released 
from the ground during the extraction of oil 
and coal.

The build-up of greenhouse gases causes a gradual 

increase in the atmospheric temperature, known as 
the enhanced greenhouse effect. This can:
●  melt polar ice caps, causing flooding of low-lying land
●  change weather conditions in some countries, 

increasing flooding or reducing rainfall – changing 
arable (farm) land to desert; extreme weather 
conditions become more common

●  cause the extinction of some species that cannot 

survive in raised temperatures.

Eutrophication
In Chapter 6 it was explained that plants need a 
supply of nitrates for making their proteins. They 
also need a source of phosphates for many chemical 
reactions in their cells. The rate at which plants grow 
is often limited by how much nitrate and phosphate 
they can obtain. In recent years, the amount of 
nitrate and phosphate in our rivers and lakes has 
been greatly increased. This leads to an accelerated 
process of eutrophication.

Eutrophication is the enrichment of natural 

waters with nutrients that allow the water to support 
an increasing amount of plant life. This process 
takes place naturally in many inland waters but 
usually very slowly. The excessive enrichment that 
results from human activities leads to an overgrowth 
of microscopic algae (Figure 21.21). These aquatic 
algae are at the bottom of the food chain. The extra 
nitrates and phosphates from the processes listed 
on page 329 enable them to increase so rapidly that 
they cannot be kept in check by the microscopic

short of oxygen that the fish have died from suffocation.

The greenhouse effect and global 
warming
Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 
influenced by natural processes and by human activities. 
Processes that change the equilibrium (balance) include:
●  cutting down forests (deforestation) – less 

photosynthesis

●  combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas)

animals which normally eat them. So they die and 
fall to the bottom of the river or lake. Here, their 
bodies are broken down by bacteria. The bacteria 
need oxygen to carry out this breakdown and the 
oxygen is taken from the water (Figure 21.24). 
So much oxygen is taken that the water becomes 
deoxygenated and can no longer support animal 
life. Fish and other organisms die from suffocation 
(Figure 21.22).

The following processes are the main causes of 

eutrophication.

 Discharge of treated sewage
In a sewage treatment plant, human waste is 
broken down by bacteria and made harmless, but 
the breakdown products include phosphates and 
nitrates. When the water from the sewage treatment 
is discharged into rivers it contains large quantities of 
phosphates and nitrates, which allow the microscopic 
plant life to grow very rapidly (Figure 21.21).

 Use of detergents
Some detergents contain a lot of phosphate. This is 
not removed by sewage treatment and is discharged 
into rivers. The large amount of phosphates 
encourages growth of microscopic plants (algae).

 Arable farming

grassland has been ploughed up in order to grow

Pollution

arable crops such as wheat and barley. When soil is 
exposed in this way, the bacteria, aided by the extra 
oxygen and water, produce soluble nitrates, which are 
washed into streams and rivers where they promote 
the growth of algae. If the nitrates reach underground 
water stores they may increase the nitrate in drinking 
water to levels considered ‘unsafe’ for babies.

Some people think that it is excessive use of 

artificial fertilisers that causes this pollution but there 
is not much evidence for this.

 ‘Factory farming’
Chickens and calves are often reared in large sheds 
instead of in open fields. Their urine and faeces 
are washed out of the sheds with water forming 
‘slurry’. If this slurry gets into streams and rivers it 
supplies an excess of nitrates and phosphates for the 
microscopic algae.

The degree of pollution of river water is often 

measured by its biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD). This is the amount of oxygen used up by a 
sample of water in a fixed period of time. The higher 
the BOD, the more polluted the water is likely to be.

It is possible to reduce eutrophication by using:

• detergents with less phosphates
• agricultural fertilisers that do not dissolve so easily
• animal wastes on the land instead of letting them 

reach rivers.

Plastics and the environment
Plastics that are non-biodegradable are not broken 
down by decomposers when dumped in landfill sites 
or left as litter. This means that they remain in the 
environment, taking up valuable space or causing 
visual pollution. Discarded plastic bottles can trap 
small animals; nylon fishing lines and nets can trap 
birds and mammals such as seals and dolphins. 
As the plastics in water gradually deteriorate, they 
fragment into tiny pieces, which are eaten by fish and 
birds, making them ill. When plastic is burned, it can 
release toxic gases.

Plastic bags are a big problem, taking up a lot of 

space in landfill sites. In 2002, the Republic of Ireland 
introduced a plastic bag fee, called a PlasTax, to try 
to control the problem. It had a dramatic effect, 
cutting the use of single-use bags from 1.2 billion to 
230 million a year and reducing the litter problem 
that plastic bags create. Revenue raised from the fee 
is used to support environmental projects. 

Air pollution
Some factories (Figure 21.25) and most motor 
vehicles release poisonous substances into the 
air. Factories produce smoke and sulfur dioxide; 
cars produce lead compounds, carbon monoxide 
and the oxides of nitrogen, which lead to smog 
(Figure 21.26) and acid rain (Figure 21.27).

Figure 21.26  Photochemical ‘smog’ over a city

Figure 21.25  Air pollution by industry. Tall chimneys keep pollution away 
from the immediate surroundings but the atmosphere is still polluted.

Sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen
Coal and oil contain sulfur. When these fuels are 
burned, they release sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the 
air (Figure 21.28). Although the tall chimneys of 
factories (Figure 21.25) send smoke and sulfur 
dioxide high into the air, the sulfur dioxide dissolves 
in rainwater and forms an acid. When this acid falls 
on buildings, it slowly dissolves the limestone and 
mortar. When it falls on plants, it reduces their 
growth and damages their leaves.

This form of pollution has been going on for 

many years and is getting worse. In North America, 
Scandinavia and Scotland, forests are being destroyed 
(Figure 21.27) and fi sh are dying in lakes, at least 
partly as a result of acid rain.

Oxides of nitrogen from power stations and 
vehicle exhausts also contribute to atmospheric 
pollution and acid rain. The nitrogen oxides dissolve 
in rain drops and form nitric acid.

Oxides of nitrogen also take part in reactions with 
other atmospheric pollutants and produce ozone. It 
may be the ozone and the nitrogen oxides that are 
largely responsible for the damage observed in forests.
One effect of acid rain is that it dissolves out the 

aluminium salts in the soil. These salts eventually 
reach toxic levels in streams and lakes.

There is still some argument about the source of 
the acid gases that produce acid rain. For example, 
a large proportion of the sulfur dioxide in the 
atmosphere comes from the natural activities of 

Pollution

certain marine algae. These microscopic ‘plants’ 
produce the gas dimethyl sulfi de which is oxidised to 
sulfur dioxide in the air.

Nevertheless, there is considerable circumstantial 

evidence that industrial activities in Britain, America and 
Central and Eastern Europe add large amounts of extra 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.

Control of air pollution
 The Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968
These acts designated certain city areas as ‘smokeless 
zones’ in Britain. The use of coal for domestic 
heating was prohibited and factories were not 
allowed to emit black smoke. This was effective in 
abolishing dense fogs in cities but did not stop the 
discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in 
the country as a whole.

 Reduction of acid gases
The concern over the damaging effects of acid rain 
has led many countries to press for regulations to 
reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides.

Reduction of sulfur dioxide can be achieved either 

by fi tting desulfurisation plants to power stations 
or by changing the fuel or the way it is burnt. In 
1986, Britain decided to fi t desulfurisation plants to 
three of its major power stations, but also agreed to 
a United Nations protocol to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions to 50% of 1980 levels by the year 2000,

and to 20% by 2010. This was to be achieved largely 
by changing from coal-fired to gas-fired power 
stations.

 Reduction of vehicle emissions
Oxides of nitrogen come, almost equally, from 
industry and from motor vehicles (Figure 21.28). 
Flue gases from industry can be treated to 
remove most of the nitrogen oxides. Vehicles can 
have catalytic converters fitted to their exhaust 
systems. These converters remove most of the 
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburned 
hydrocarbons. They add £200–600 to the cost of 
a car and will work only if lead-free petrol is used, 
because lead blocks the action of the catalyst.

Another solution is to redesign car engines to 
burn petrol at lower temperatures (‘lean burn’ 
engines). These emit less nitrogen oxide but just as 
much carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons as normal 
engines.

In the long term, it may be possible to use fuels 

such as alcohol or hydrogen, which do not produce 
so many pollutants.

The European Union has set limits on exhaust 

emissions. From 1989, new cars over 2 litres had to 
have catalytic converters and from 1993 smaller cars 
had to fit them as well.

Regulations introduced in 1995 should cut 

emissions of particulates by 75% and nitrogen oxides 
by 50%. These reductions will have less effect if the 
volume of traffic continues to increase. Significant 
reduction of pollutants is more likely if the number 
of vehicles is stabilised and road freight is reduced.

Protecting the ozone layer
The appearance of ‘ozone holes’ in the Antarctic 
and Arctic, and the thinning of the ozone layer 
elsewhere, spurred countries to get together and 
agree to reduce the production and use of CFCs 
(chlorofluorocarbons) and other ozone-damaging 
chemicals.

1987 saw the first Montreal protocol, which set 
targets for the reduction and phasing out of these 
chemicals. In 1990, nearly 100 countries, including 
Britain, agreed to the next stage of the Montreal 
protocol, which committed them to reduce 
production of CFCs by 85% in 1994 and phase 
them out completely by 2000. Overall, the Montreal 

332

protocol has proved to be very successful: by 2012, 
the world had phased-out 98% of the ozone-
depleting substances such as CFCs. However, the 
chemicals that were used to replace CFCs (HCFCs) 
are not as harmless as they were first thought to be, 
as they contribute to global warming.

The ‘greenhouse effect’ and global 
warming
The Earth’s surface receives and absorbs radiant 
heat from the Sun. It re-radiates some of this heat 
back into space. The Sun’s radiation is mainly in the 
form of short-wavelength energy and penetrates our 
atmosphere easily. The energy radiated back from the 
Earth is in the form of long wavelengths (infrared 
or IR), much of which is absorbed by the atmosphere. 
The atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse. 
It lets in light and heat from the Sun but reduces the 
amount of heat that escapes (Figure 21.29).

If it were not for this ‘greenhouse effect’ of the 

atmosphere, the Earth’s surface would probably 
be at –18 °C. The ‘greenhouse effect’, therefore, is 
entirely natural and desirable.

Not all the atmospheric gases are equally effective 

at absorbing IR radiation. Oxygen and nitrogen, 
for example, absorb little or none. The gases that 
absorb most IR radiation, in order of maximum 
absorption, are water vapour, carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane and atmospheric pollutants such 
as oxides of nitrogen and CFCs. Apart from water 
vapour, these gases are in very low concentrations 
in the atmosphere, but some of them are strong 
absorbers of IR radiation. It is assumed that if the 
concentration of any of these gases were to increase, 
the greenhouse effect would be enhanced and the 
Earth would get warmer.

In recent years, attention has focused principally 

on CO2. If you look back at the carbon cycle in 
Chapter 19, you will see that the natural processes 
of photosynthesis, respiration and decay would be 
expected to keep the CO2 concentration at a steady 
level. However, since the Industrial Revolution, we 
have been burning ‘fossil fuels’ derived from coal 
and petroleum and releasing extra CO2 into the 
atmosphere. As a result, the concentration of CO2 
has increased from 0.029 to 0.039% since 1860. It is 
likely to go on increasing as we burn more and more

fossil fuel. According to NOAA data, CO2 levels 
rose 2.67 parts per million in 2012, to 395 ppm. 
This was the second largest increase since 1959, 
when scientists first began measuring atmospheric 
CO2 levels. 

Although it is not possible to prove beyond all 

reasonable doubt that production of CO2 and other 
‘greenhouse gases’ is causing a rise in the Earth’s 
temperature, i.e. global warming, the majority 
of scientists and climatologists agree that it is 
happening now and will get worse unless we take 
drastic action to reduce the output of these gases.

Predictions of the effects of global warming 

depend on computer models. But these depend on 
very complex and uncertain interactions of variables.

Changes in climate might increase cloud cover 
and this might reduce the heat reaching the Earth 
from the Sun. Oceanic plankton absorb a great deal 
of CO2. Will the rate of absorption increase or will a 
warmer ocean absorb less of the gas? An increase in 
CO2 should, theoretically, result in increased rates 
of photosynthesis, bringing the system back into 
balance.

None of these possibilities is known for certain. 
The worst scenario is that the climate and rainfall 

Pollution

distribution will change, and disrupt the present 
pattern of world agriculture; the oceans will expand 
and the polar icecaps will melt, causing a rise in sea 
level; extremes of weather may produce droughts 
and food shortages.

An average of temperature records from around 

the world suggests that, since 1880, there has 
been a rise of 0.7–0.9 °C, most of it very recently 
(Figure 21.30), but this is too short a period from 
which to draw firm conclusions about long-term 
trends. If the warming trend continues, however, it 
could produce a rise in sea level of between 0.2 and 
1.5 metres in the next 50–100 years.

The first Kyoto Conference (Japan) in 1997 set 
targets for the industrialised countries to reduce  
CO2 emissions by an average of 5.2% by 2010. 
Europe, as a whole, agreed to cuts of 8%, though 
this average allowed some countries to increase their 
emissions. The countries committed to the Kyoto 
convention, excluding the USA, eventually modified 
the targets, but agreed to make cuts of 4.2% on 
average for the period 2008–2012.

Britain planned to reduce emissions by 20% of 
1990 levels by 2010 but really needed an overall 
cut of 60% to halt the progress of global warming. 
The big industrialised countries who contribute 80% 
of the greenhouse gases, particularly the USA, are 
opposed to measures that might interfere with their 
industries, claiming that global warming is not a 
proven fact.

The precautionary principle suggests that, even 
if global warming is not taking place, our supplies 
of fossil fuels will eventually run out and we need 
to develop alternative sources of energy now.

The generation of energy using fossil fuels is the 
biggest source of CO2 released by humans into the 
atmosphere. The alternatives are nuclear power or 
methods such as wind farms and solar energy. The 
experiences of Chernobyl and Fukushima have made 
people around the world very wary of the nuclear 
option. Not all countries have climates and weather 
suited to alternative energy and their environmental 
impact (visual and sometimes through the noise 
they can create) creates opponents to these 
methods. The next section discusses this topic in 
more detail.

Pollution by contraceptive hormones
When women use the contraceptive pill, the 
hormones in it (oestrogen or progesterone – 
Chapter 16) are excreted in urine and become 
present in sewage. The process of sewage treatment 

●● Conservation
Key definition
A sustainable resource is one that is produced as rapidly as it is 

removed from the environment so that it does not run out.

Non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels need 
to be conserved because the stocks of them on the 
planet are finite: coal, oil, natural gas and minerals 
(including metallic ores) cannot be replaced once 
their sources have been totally depleted. Estimates 
of how long these stocks will last are unreliable but 
in some cases, e.g. lead and tin, they are less than 
100 years.

By the time that fossil fuels run out, we will have to 
have alternative sources of energy. Even the uranium 
used in nuclear reactors is a finite resource and will, 
one day, run out.

The alternative sources of energy available to us 
are hydroelectric, nuclear, wind and wave power, 
wood and other plant products. The first two are well 
established; the others are either in the experimental 
stages, making only a small contribution, or are more 
expensive (at present) than fossil fuels (Figure 21.31).
Plant products are renewable resources and 
include alcohol distilled from fermented sugar (from 
sugar-cane), which can replace or supplement petrol 
(Figure 21.32), sunflower oil, which can replace 
diesel fuel, and wood from fast-growing trees. In 

does not extract the hormones, so they end up 
in water systems such as rivers, lakes and the 
sea. Their presence in this water affects aquatic 
organisms as they enter food chains. For example, 
male frogs and fish can become ‘feminised’ (they 
can start producing eggs in their testes instead 
of sperm). This causes an imbalance between 
numbers of male and female animals (more females 
than males).

Drinking water, extracted from rivers where 

water from treated sewage has been recycled, can 
also contain the hormones. This has been shown to 
reduce the sperm count in men, causing a reduction 
in fertility.

It should be noted that the contraceptive pill is 
not the only source of female hormones in water 
systems: natural hormones are also present in urine 
from cattle, for example, and these can enter the 
water with run-off from farms.

land or offshore, these generators make an increasing contribution to

addition, plant and animal waste material can be 
decomposed anaerobically in fermenters to produce 
biogas, which consists largely of methane.

Chemicals for industry or drugs, currently derived 

from petroleum, will have to be made from plant 
products.

In theory, fuels produced from plant sources 

should have a minimal effect on the carbon dioxide 
concentration in the atmosphere and, therefore, on 
global warming. The carbon dioxide released when 
they are burned derives from the carbon dioxide 
they absorbed during their photosynthesis. They 
are ‘carbon neutral’. However, the harvesting 
of the crop and the processes of extraction and 
distillation all produce carbon dioxide. The 
net effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide is 
questionable.

Also, the clearing of forests to make space for fuel 

crops removes a valuable carbon sink and the burning 
that accompanies it produces a great deal of carbon 
dioxide. In addition, the use of land for growing 
crops for biofuels reduces the land available for 
growing food and increases the price of food.

Currently, the benefit of deriving fuel from plant 

material is open to question.

When non-renewable resources run out they will 

have to be replaced by recycling or by using man-
made materials derived from plant products. Already 
some bacteria have been genetically engineered to 
produce substances that can be converted to plastics.
Some resources, such as forests and fish stocks can be 
maintained with careful management. This may involve 
replanting land with new seedlings as mature trees 
are felled and controlling the activities of fishermen 
operating where fish stocks are being depleted.

Recycling
As minerals and other resources become scarcer, 
they also become more expensive. It then pays to 
use them more than once. The recycling of materials 
may also reduce the amount of energy used in 
manufacturing. In turn this helps to conserve fuels 
and reduce pollution.

For example, producing aluminium alloys from 

scrap uses only 5% of the energy that would be 
needed to make them from aluminium ores. In 2000, 
Europe recycled 64.3% of the aluminium in waste. 
Germany and Finland do really well, partly because 
they have a deposit scheme on cans: they recycle 
between 95 and 96% of their aluminium waste.

About 60% of the lead used in Britain is recycled. 
This seems quite good until you realise that it also 
means that 40% of this poisonous substance enters 
the environment.

Manufacturing glass bottles uses about three times 

more energy than if they were collected, sorted, 
cleaned and reused. Recycling the glass from bottles 
does not save energy but does reduce the demand for 
sand used in glass manufacture. In 2007, 57% of glass 
containers were recycled in Britain. 

 Polythene waste is now also recycled (Figure 21.33). 

The plastic is used to make items such as car seat 
covers, sports shoes, hi-fi headphones and even bridges 
(Figure 21.34).

Waste paper can be pulped and used again, mainly 

for making paper and cardboard. Newspapers are 
de-inked and used again for newsprint. One tonne of 
waste paper is equivalent to perhaps 17 trees. (Paper 
is made from wood-pulp.) So collecting waste paper 
may help to cut a country’s import bill for timber and 
spare a few more hectares of natural habitat from the 
spread of commercial forestry.

Sewage treatment
Micro-organisms, mainly bacteria and protoctista, 
play an essential part in the treatment of sewage to 
make it harmless.

Sewage contains bacteria from the human intestine 

that can be harmful (Chapter 10). These bacteria 
must be destroyed in order to prevent the spread of 
intestinal diseases. Sewage also contains substances 
from household wastes (such as soap and detergent) 
and chemicals from factories. These too must be 
removed before the sewage effluent is released 
into the rivers. Rainwater from the streets is also 
combined with the sewage.

industrial use.
Inland towns have to make their sewage harmless 
in a sewage treatment plant before discharging the 
effluent into rivers. A sewage works removes solid 
and liquid waste from the sewage, so that the water 
leaving the works is safe to drink.

In a large town, the main method of sewage 

treatment is by the activated sludge process 
(Figures 21.35 and 21.36).

The activated sludge process
1 Screening. The sewage entering the sewage 

works is first ‘screened’. That is, it is made to flow 
through a metal grid, which removes the solids like 
rags, plastics, wood and so forth. The ‘screenings’ 
are raked off and disposed of – by incineration, for 
example.

2 Grit. The sewage next flows slowly through long 

channels. As it flows, grit and sand in it settle down 
to the bottom and are removed from time to time. 
The grit is washed and used for landfill.

3 First settling tanks. The liquid continues slowly 
through another series of tanks. Here about 40% 
of the organic matter settles out as crude sludge. 

The rest of the organic matter is in the form of tiny 
suspended particles, which pass, with the liquid, to 
the aeration tanks.
  The semi-liquid sludge from the bottom of the 
tank is pumped to the sludge digestion plant.

4 Aeration tanks. Oxygen is added to the sewage 

liquid, either by stirring it or by bubbling 
compressed air through it. Aerobic bacteria and 
protoctista grow and reproduce rapidly in these 
conditions.
  These micro-organisms clump the organic 
particles together. Enzymes from the bacteria 
digest the solids to soluble products, which are 
absorbed by the bacteria and used for energy 
and growth.
  Dissolved substances in the sewage are used in 
the same way. Different bacteria turn urea into 
ammonia, ammonia into nitrates and nitrates into 
nitrogen gas. The bacteria derive energy from these 
chemical changes. The protoctista (Figure 21.37) 
eat the bacteria. 
  In this way, the suspended solids and dissolved 
substances in sewage are converted to nitrogen, 
carbon dioxide (from respiration) and the 
cytoplasm of the bacteria and protoctista, leaving 
fairly pure water. 

5 Second settling tanks. The micro-organisms settle 

out, forming a fine sludge, which is returned to 
the aeration tanks to maintain the population of 
micro-organisms. This is the ‘activated sludge’ 
from which the process gets its name. The sewage

stays in the aeration tanks for only 6–8 hours but 
the recycling of activated sludge allows the micro-
organisms to act on it for 20–30 days.

6 When all the sludge has settled, the water is pure 

enough to discharge into a river and the sludge 
passes to a digester, which is used to produce 
methane (biogas).

Figure 21.36  Sewage treatment – activated sludge method. In the 
foreground are the rectangular aeration tanks. 

Biogas production is not confined to sludge. Many 
organic wastes, e.g. those from sugar factories, can 
be fermented anaerobically to produce biogas. In 
developing countries, biogas generators use animal 
dung to produce methane for whole villages. On 
a small scale, biogas is a useful form of sustainable 
alternative energy.

Endangering species and causing their 
extinction
Anything that reduces the population of a species 
endangers it (puts it at risk of extinction). Factors 
that endanger species include habitat destruction, the 
introduction of other species, hunting, international 
trade or pollution. Climate change can also put 
species at risk of extinction.

Species become extinct in the course of evolution. 

After all, the fossil remains of plants and animals 
represent organisms that became extinct hundreds of 
thousands of years ago. There have been periods of mass 
extinction, such as that which wiped out the dinosaurs 
during the Cretaceous era, 65 million years ago.

lampreys found their way into the lakes through the 
new waterways. The lampreys had no natural predators 
in the lakes and fed on trout by sticking to them 
with their circular mouths and boring into their flesh 
(Figure 21.39). The fisheries in the lakes harvested 
about 7 million kilograms of trout annually before the 
lampreys entered the water systems. Afterwards, the 
harvest dropped to about 136 000 kilograms, so the 
fisheries collapsed. The lampreys are now controlled to 
enable the trout population to recover.

 21  Human inFluences on ecosystems

The ‘background’ extinction rate for, say, birds 
might be one species in 100–1000 years. Today, as 
a result of human activity, the rate of extinction has 
gone up by at least ten times and possibly as much as 
1000 times. Some estimates suggest that the world 
is losing one species every day and within 20 years 
at least 25% of all forms of wildlife could become 
extinct. Reliable evidence for these figures is hard to 
obtain, however.

A classic example is the colonisation of the Pacific 
islands by the Polynesians. They hunted and ate the 
larger bird species, and introduced rats, which ate 
the eggs and young of ground-nesting species. Their 
goats and cattle destroyed plant species through 
grazing and trampling. Of about 1000 plant species, 
85% has been lost since they were first discovered.
This may be an extreme example but the same 

sorts of changes are happening all over the world. For 
example, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) 
estimated that only about 3200 tigers remained in 
the wild in 2011. This is less than 5% of their number 
in 1900 (Figure 21.38). They are hunted for their 
skins and their bones and some body parts are used in 
traditional Chinese medicines.

Figure 21.39  Sea lamprey feeding on a trout
Climate change is also responsible for a reduction in 
the number of species. Some people argue that this is 
a natural, uncontrollable process, but the consensus 
by scientists is that processes like global warming are 
made worse by human activity. 

Global warming is causing oceans to warm up. 

Even prolonged temperature increases of just one or 
two degrees can have a devastating effect. In 1994, 
coral colonies (see Figure 1.8) in the Indian Ocean 
were observed to expel food-producing algae they 
are closely associated with. As the coral rely on the 
algae, if they lose them they die. The coral reefs 
became bleached. When the area was surveyed again 
in 2005, four fish species appeared to be extinct and 
six other species had declined to the point of being 
endangered. Increases in CO2 in the sea also affect 
coral reefs. The CO2 dissolves in the water, making it 
more acidic. The acid dissolves the calcium carbonate 
deposited in the coral, making it collapse.

Species such as the Atlantic cod are becoming 

endangered and at possible risk of extinction, partly 
because of overfishing (see Chapter 19) but also 
because of climate change. Cod survive in cold water. 

In 110 years the tiger population has fallen from 120 000 

Figure 21.38 
to 3200.
Some species of animal are not introduced deliberately 
into different ecosystems, but find their way in due 
to man’s activities and then upset food chains. One 
example happened in the Great Lakes in Canada and 
the USA. The lakes were artificially joined together 
with shipping canals to provide transport links, but sea 

338

8/18/14   10:03 PM

As seawater warms up, the cod migrate north. However, 
the populations of microscopic plankton that cod 
rely on further down the food chain are also sensitive 
to temperature change – cod may not have the food 
supplies they need to survive. 

Scientists developed a computer model to study 
the effect of climate change on fish stocks over the 
next 50 years. It predicted a large-scale redistribution 
of species and the extinction of some species, with 
the disruption of ecosystems and reduction in 
biodiversity.

Conservation of species
Species can be conserved by passing laws that make 
killing or collecting them an offence, by international 
agreements on global bans or trading restrictions, 
and by conserving habitats (Figure 21.40).

Habitats can be conserved in a number of ways:

●  using laws to protect the habitat
●  using wardens to protect the habitat
●  reducing or controlling public access to the habitat
●  controlling factors such as water drainage and 

grazing, that may otherwise help to destroy the 
habitat.

In Britain, it is an offence to capture or kill almost all 
species of wild birds or to take eggs from their nests; 
wild flowers in their natural habitats may not be 
uprooted; newts, otters and bats are just three of the 
protected species of mammal.

Many organisations monitor species numbers, 

so that conservation measures can be taken if they 
decline significantly.

CITES (Convention on International Trade 

in Endangered Species) gives protection to about 
1500 animals and thousands of plants by persuading 
governments to restrict or ban trade in endangered 
species or their products, e.g. snake skins or rhino 
horns. In 2013, nearly 180 countries were party to 
the Convention.

The WWF operates on a global scale and is 

represented in 25 countries. The WWF raises money 
for conservation projects in all parts of the world, but 
with particular emphasis on endangered species and 
habitats.

The IWC (International Whaling Commission) 

was set up to try and avoid the extinction of 
whales as a result of uncontrolled whaling, and has 
88 members.

conservation

Figure 21.40  Trying to stop the trade in endangered species. A customs 
official checks an illegal cargo impounded at a customs post.
The IWC allocates quotas of whales that the member 
countries may catch but, having no powers to 
enforce its decisions, cannot prevent countries from 
exceeding their quotas.

In 1982, the IWC declared a moratorium (i.e. a 
complete ban) on all whaling, which was reaffirmed 
in 2000 and is still in place in 2014, despite 
opposition from Japan and Norway. Japan continues 
to catch whales ‘for scientific purposes’.

Captive breeding and reintroductions
Provided a species has not become totally extinct, it 
may be possible to boost its numbers by breeding 
in captivity and releasing the animals back into the 
environment. In Britain, modest success has been 
achieved with otters (Figure 21.41). It is important 
(a) that the animals do not become dependent on 
humans for food and (b) that there are suitable 
habitats left for them to recolonise.

Sea eagles, red kites (Figure 21.42) and ospreys 

have been introduced from areas where they are 
plentiful to areas where they had died out.

Habitats are many and varied: from vast areas of 

tropical forest to the village pond, and including 
such diverse habitats as wetlands, peat bogs, coral 
reefs, mangrove swamps, lakes and rivers, to list 
but a few.

International initiatives
In the last 30 years it has been recognised that 
conservation of major habitats needed international 
agreements on strategies. In 1992, the Convention 
on Biological Diversity was opened for signature 
at the ‘Earth Summit’ Conference in Rio, and 168 
countries signed it. The Convention aims to preserve 
biological diversity (‘biodiversity’).

Biodiversity encompasses the whole range of 
species in the world. The Convention will try to 
share the costs and benefits between developed 
and developing countries, promote ‘sustainable 
development’ and support local initiatives.

‘Sustainable development’ implies that industry 

and agriculture should use natural resources sparingly 
and avoid damaging natural habitats and the 
organisms in them.

Key definition
Sustainable development is development providing for 
the needs of an increasing human population without 
harming the environment.

The Earth Summit meeting addressed problems of 
population, global warming, pollution, etc. as well as 
biodiversity.

There are several voluntary organisations that work 

for worldwide conservation, e.g. WWF, Friends of 
the Earth and Greenpeace.

them and dragging the trees out of the forest also 
creates more damage. Education of the men carrying 
out the operations in alternative ways of tree 
felling, reduction of wastage and in the selection of 
species of trees to be felled makes the process more 
sustainable and helps to conserve rarer species.

In the tomato fish project in Germany (see 

later in this section), the Research Institute 
involved has an active education programme to 
inform the public about its work in sustainable 
development. It has even published a book for 
children (Nina and the tomato fish) to educate them 
about the topic.

Figure 21.42  Red kites from Spain and Sweden have been reintroduced 
to Britain.

Seed banks
These are a way of protecting plant species from 
extinction. They include seed from food crops and 
rare species. They act as gene banks (see the next 
section). The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership 
was set up by Kew Botanical Gardens in London. 
It is a global project involving 80 partner countries. 
The target of the partnership is to have in storage 
25% of the world’s plant species with bankable seeds 
by 2020. That involves about 75 000 plant species.
Conservation of habitats
If animals and plants are to be conserved it is vital 
that their habitats are conserved also.

Sustaining forest and fish stocks
There are three main ways of sustaining the numbers 
of key species. These are:

1  Education
Local communities need to be educated about 
the need for conservation. Once they understand 
its importance, the environment they live in is 
more likely to be cared for and the species in it 
protected. 

In tree-felling operations in tropical rainforests, 
it has been found that the process of cutting down 
the trees actually damages twice as many next to

2  Legal quotas
In Europe the Common Fisheries Policy is used 
to set quotas for fishing, to manage fish stocks and 
help protect species that were becoming endangered 
through overfishing (see Chapter 19). Quotas were 
set for each species of fish taken commercially and 
also for the size of fish. This was to allow fish to 
reach breeding age and maintain or increase their 
populations.

The Rainforest Alliance has introduced a scheme 
called Smartlogging. This is a certification service, 
which demonstrates that a logging company is 
working legally and is a sustainable way to protect 
the environment. The timber can be tracked from 
where it is felled to its final export destination and 
its use in timber products. The customer can then 
be reassured that the timber in the product is from a 
reputable source and has not been removed illegally.
In some areas of China where bamboo is growing, 

there are legal quotas to prevent too much felling. 
Some animals such as giant panda rely on the 
bamboo for their food.

In Britain it is illegal to cut down trees without 

permission. The Forestry Commission issues licenses 
for tree felling. Included in the license are conditions 
that the felled area must be replanted and the trees 
maintained for a minimum of ten years.

3  Restocking
Where populations of a fish species are in decline, 
their numbers may be conserved by a restocking 
programme. This involves breeding fish in captivity, 
then releasing them into the wild. However, the 
reasons for the decline in numbers need to be 
identified first. For example, if pollution was the 
cause of the decline, the restocked fish will die as 
well: the issue of pollution needs to be addressed 
first. Great care is needed in managing fish farms 
because they can produce pollution if the waste 
water from the farms, containing uneaten food and 
fish excreta, is discharged into the environment.

Organisations such as the Woodland Trust help to 
conserve areas of woodland and provide funding for 
restocking where species of trees are in decline. This 
is important as some animal species rely on certain 
trees for food and shelter. Large areas of land planted 
with single species (an example of a monoculture) 
create little biodiversity. In Britain, the Forestry  

conservation

Commission has been steadily increasing the range of 
tree species it plants, growing them in mixed woodland, 
which provides habitats for a wider range of animals.

Sustainable development 
This is a complex process, requiring the management 
of conflicting demands. As the world’s population 
grows, so does the demand for the extraction of 
resources from the environment. However, this 
needs to be carried out in a controlled way to 
prevent environmental damage and strategies need 
to be put in place to ensure habitats and species 
diversity are not threatened. 

Planning the removal of resources needs to be 

done at local, national and international levels. This 
is to make sure that everyone involved with the 
process is aware of the potential consequences of the 
process on the environment, and that appropriate 
strategies are put in place, and adhered to, to 
minimise any risk. 

 Tomato fish project
The ASTAF-PRO project – Aquaponic System for 
(nearly) Emission-Free Tomato and Fish Production 
– in Germany is run by the Leibniz Institute of 
Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries. The 
scientists have developed a way of simultaneously 
producing fish and tomatoes in a closed greenhouse 
environment. Both organisms thrive at a temperature 
of 27 °C. The system is almost emission-free 
(so atmospheric CO2 levels are not affected), recycles 
all the water in the process and does not put any 
waste into the environment (Figure 21.43). All the 
energy needed to heat the greenhouses is generated 
by solar panels. These factors make it a sustainable 
and climate-friendly method of food production. 
The scientists recognised that fish and plants have 
very similar environmental needs for their growth. 
Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is chosen as the 
fish species, because they survive well in artificial 
conditions, growing and maturing quickly. Since 
they are omnivorous as adults, no fish meal diet is 
needed, and they can be fed with pellets of processed 
food extracted from plants. Water from the fish tanks 
is cleaned and the nutrients remaining in it are used 
as a fertiliser for tomato plants, grown in the same 
greenhouse (Figure 21.44).

The plants are grown on mineral wool, through 

which the nutrient-rich water fl ows. This avoids 
soil, which can contain pathogens. This method of 
growing plants, called hydroponics, also means that 
no peat is needed for soil. The removal of peat for 
use in horticulture is threatening heathland and the 
organisms living on it.

As the tomato plants transpire, the water vapour 
is condensed and recycled into the fi sh tanks. The 
tomatoes are harvested and sold under the name 
‘fi sh tomatoes’. The scientists call the project ‘The 
Tomatofi sh’. The next goal is to implement the 
system into global food production systems.

Conservation programmes
If the population of a species drops, the range of 
variation within the species drops, making it less 
able to adapt to environmental change. The species 
could, therefore, be threatened with extinction. 
When animal populations fall, there is less chance of 
individuals fi nding each other to mate.

In ‘Selection’, Chapter 18, it was expla ined that 

crossing a wild grass with a strain of wheat produced 
an improved variety. This is only one example 
of many successful attempts to improve yield, 
drought resistance and disease resistance in food 
plants. Some 25 000 plant species are threatened 
with extinction at the moment. This could result 
in a devastating loss of hereditary material and a 
reduction of about 10% in the genes available for 
crop improvement. ‘Gene banks’ have been set up 
to preserve a wide range of plants, but these banks 
are vulnerable to accidents, disease and human 
error. The only secure way of preserving the full 
range of genes is to keep the plants growing in their 
natural environments.

Conservation programmes are set up for a number 

of reasons:

 Reducing extinction
Conservation programmes strive to prevent 
extinction. Once a species becomes extinct its genes 
are lost forever, so we are also likely to deprive the 
world of genetic resources. Apart from the fact that 
we have no right to wipe out species forever, the 
chances are that we will deprive ourselves not only 
of the beauty and diversity of species but also of 
potential sources of valuable products such as drugs. 
Many of our present-day drugs are derived from 
plants (e.g. quinine and aspirin) and there may be 
many more sources as yet undiscovered. 

 Protecting vulnerable environments
Conservation programmes are often set up to 
protect threatened habitats so that rare species living 
there are not endangered. Some species of plant 
require very special conditions to grow successfully, 
for instance wet, acidic conditions associated with 
heathland (see Figure 21.46). Some animal species 
have very limited diets or other needs: the large 
heath butterfl y only feeds on one type of plant called 
cottongrass. If that plant was allowed to become 
extinct, perhaps through drainage of the peat bog 

9781444176469_IGCSE_Biology_21.indd   342

8/18/14   10:03 PM

land on which the cottongrass lives, the butterflies 
would die out as well.

There are a number of organisations involved with 
habitat conservation in Britain. English Nature, the 
Countryside Council for Wales and Scottish Natural 
Heritage were formed from the Nature Conservancy 
Council (NCC). They are regulatory bodies 
committed to establish, manage and maintain nature 
reserves, protect threatened habitats and conduct 
research into matters relevant to conservation.

The NCC established 195 nature reserves 

(Figure 21.45) but, in addition, had responsibility 
for notifying planning authorities of Areas of 
Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs), also known as 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). These are 
privately owned lands that include important habitats 
or rare species (Figure 21.46). English Nature and 
other conservation bodies establish management 
agreements with the owners so that the sites are not 
damaged by felling trees, ploughing land or draining 
fens (Figure 21.47).

Figure 21.45  An English Nature National Nature Reserve at 
Bridgewater Bay in Somerset. The mudflats and saltmarsh attract large 
numbers of wintering wildfowl.

There are now about 5000 ASSIs, and the Countryside 
and Rights of Way Act of 2000 has strengthened the 
rules governing the maintenance of ASSIs.

There are several other, non-governmental 

organisations that have set up reserves and which 
help to conserve wildlife and habitats. There are 
47 Wildlife Trusts in the UK, managing thousands 
of sites. The Royal Society for the Protection 
of Birds (RSPB) has 200 sites, the Woodland 
Trust looks after over 1100 woods and there 
are about 160 other reserves managed by other 
organisations.

Surrey is protected by a management agreement with the landowner.

Figure 21.47  The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) 
maintains this wet grassland by Loch Leven, Scotland, for nesting 
redshanks, snipe, lapwings and ducks.

The National Parks Commission has set up 15 
National Parks covering more than 9% of England 
and Wales, e.g. Dartmoor, Snowdonia and the Lake 
District. Although the land is privately owned, the 
Park Authorities are responsible for protecting the 
landscape and wildlife, and for planning public 
recreation such as walking, climbing or gliding.

The European Commission’s Habitats Directive 
of 1994 requires member states to designate Special 
Areas of Conservation (SACs) to protect some of 
the most seriously threatened habitats and species 
throughout Europe. The UK has submitted a list 
of 340 sites, though many of these are already 
protected areas, such as ASSIs.

Desirable though ASSIs, National Parks and SACs 

are, they represent only relatively small, isolated 
areas of land. Birds can move freely from one area to

another, but plants and small animals are confined 
to an isolated habitat so are subject to risks that 
they cannot escape. If more farmland were managed 
in a way ‘friendly’ to wildlife, these risks could be 
reduced.

The Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group can 
advise farmers how to manage their land in ways 
that encourage wildlife. This includes, for example, 
leaving strips of uncultivated land around the 
margins of fields or planting new hedgerows. Even 
strips of wild grasses and flowers between fields 
significantly increase the population of beneficial 
insects.

Certain areas of farmland have been designated as 
Environmental Sensitive Areas (ESAs), and farmers 
are paid a subsidy for managing their land in ways 
that conserve the environment.

Maintaining ecosystem functions
There is a danger of destabilising food chains if 
a single species in that food chain is removed. 
For example, in lakes containing pike as the top 
predators, overfishing can result in smaller species 
of carnivorous fish, such as minnows, increasing in 
numbers. They eat zooplankton. If the minnows 
eat the majority of the zooplankton population, 
it leaves no herbivores to control algal growth, 
which can cause an algal bloom when there are 
sufficient nutrients to support this growth. To 
prevent such an event happening, the ecosystem 
needs to be maintained, by controlling the 
numbers of top predators removed, or by regular 
restocking. 

Ecosystems can also become unbalanced if the 

nutrients they rely on are affected in some way. 
Guano is the accumulated droppings of seabirds and 
bats. It is extremely rich in nitrogen compounds 
and phosphates, so it makes a valuable fertiliser. 
In the early 1900s Peru and South Africa both 
developed guano industries based on sustained-yield 
production from marine birds. However, overfishing 

around their coastlines reduced fish stocks, removing 
the food the seabirds relied on. As the seabird 
populations diminished, they deposited less guano 
and the guano industries failed. 

The term ecosystem services can be defined as the 

benefits people obtain from ecosystems, whether 
they are natural or managed. Humans are affecting 
ecosystems on a large scale because of the growth in 
the population (Chapter 19) and changing patterns 
of consumption. Scientists estimate that around 
40% of the Earth’s land surface area is taken over 
by some form of farmed land. Crops are grown for 
food (directly, or indirectly through their use in 
feeding animals), extraction of drugs (both legal and 
illegal) and the manufacture of fuel (see details about 
biofuels below). Crop growth has major impacts in 
ecosystems, causing the extinction of many species 
and reducing the gene pool.

In theory, biofuels produced from plant sources 
should have a minimal effect on the carbon dioxide 
concentration in the atmosphere and, therefore, on 
global warming. The carbon dioxide released when 
they are burned derives from the carbon dioxide 
they absorbed during their photosynthesis. They 
are ‘carbon neutral’. However, the harvesting of the 
crop and the processes of extraction and distillation 
all produce carbon dioxide. The net effect on 
atmospheric carbon dioxide is questionable. More 
details of biofuels are given in Chapter 20.

Also, the clearing of forests to make space for 

fuel crops removes a valuable carbon sink and the 
burning that accompanies it produces a great deal 
of carbon dioxide. In addition, the use of land for 
growing crops for biofuels reduces the land available 
for growing food and increases the price of food. 
Currently, the benefit of deriving fuel from plant 
material is open to question.

With all these demands on resources from 

ecosystems, it is a very complicated process to 
manage them effectively and this makes conservation 
programmes invaluable to protect species and their 
habitats.

Checklist
Food supply

•  Modern technology has resulted in increased food 

production.

•  Agricultural machinery can be used on larger areas of land to 

improve effi ciency.

•  Chemical fertilisers improve yields.
•  Insecticides improve quality and yield.
•  Herbicides reduce competition with weeds.
•  Selective breeding improves production by crop plants and 

livestock.

•  Monocultures can have negative impacts on the 

environment.

•  Intensive farming has resulted in habitat deterioration and 

reduction of wildlife.

•  Problems with world food supplies contribute to 

diffi culties providing enough food for an increasing 
human global population.

•  Food production in developed countries has increased 

faster than the population growth.

•  Food production in developing countries has not kept 

pace with population growth.

•  Problems that contribute to famine include unequal 

distribution of food, drought, fl ooding and an increasing 
population.

Habitat destruction

•  There are a number of reasons for habitat destruction, including:

–  increased area needed for food-crop growth, livestock 

production and housing

–  the extraction of natural resources
–  marine pollution. 

•  Through altering food webs and food chains, humans can 

negatively impact on habitats.

•  Deforestation is an example of habitat destruction: it can 

lead to extinction, soil erosion, fl ooding and carbon dioxide 
build-up in the atmosphere.

•  The conversion of tropical forest to agricultural land usually 

results in failure because forest soils are poor in nutrients.

•  Deforestation has many undesirable effects on the 

environment.

Pollution

•  We pollute our lakes, rivers and the sea with industrial 
waste, sewage, crude oil, rubbish, factory wastes and 
nuclear fall-out.

•  Use of fertilisers can result in water pollution.
•  Pesticides kill insects, weeds and fungi that could destroy 

our crops.

•  Pesticides help to increase agricultural production but they 

kill other organisms as well as pests.

•  The extra carbon dioxide from fossil fuels might lead to 

global warming.

•  The process of eutrophication of water involves:
–  increased availability of nitrate and other ions
–  increased growth of producers
–  increased decomposition after death of the producers
–  increased aerobic respiration by bacteria, resulting in a 

reduction in dissolved oxygen

–  the death of organisms requiring dissolved oxygen in 

water.

•  Non-biodegradable plastics can have detrimental effects 

on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

•  Sulfur dioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels, causes 

acid rain. This kills plants, as well as animals in water 
systems.

•  Measures that might be taken to reduce sulfur dioxide 
pollution and reduce the impact of acid rain include a 
reduction in use of fossil fuels.

•  Methane and carbon dioxide are building up in the 

atmosphere, resulting in the enhanced greenhouse effect 
and climate change.

•  Female contraceptive hormones are entering water 

courses and can cause reduced sperm count in men and 
feminisation of aquatic organisms.

Conservation

•  A sustainable resource is one that can be removed from the 

environment without it running out.

•  Raw materials, such as metal ores, will one day run out.

•  Some organisms are becoming endangered or extinct due to 
factors such as climate change, habitat destruction, hunting, 
pollution and introduced species.

•  Endangered species can be conserved by strategies that 
include monitoring and protecting species and habitats, 
education, captive breeding programmes and seed banks.

•  Sustainable development is development providing for 
the needs of an increasing human population without 
harming the environment.

•  Forest and fish stocks can be sustained using strategies 

such as education and legal quotas.

•  Sustainable development requires the management of 

conflicting demands, as well as planning and co-operation 
at local, national and international levels.

•  Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, human 

activities are causing a great increase in the rates of extinction.
•  Conservation of species requires international agreements 

and regulations.

•  These regulations may prohibit killing or collecting species 

and prevent trade in them or their products.

•  Loss of a plant species deprives us of (a) a possible source 
of genes and (b) a possible source of chemicals for drugs.

•  Conserving a species by captive breeding is of little use 

unless its habitat is also conserved.

•  The Earth Summit Conference tried to achieve 

international agreement on measures to conserve wildlife 
and habitats, and reduce pollution.

•  National Parks, nature reserves, ASSIs and SACs all try to 

preserve habitats but they cover only a small proportion of 
the country and exist as isolated communities.

•  Incentives exist for farming in a way that is friendly to wildlife.

1 Enzymes are used commercially to extract fruit 

juices. The use of enzymes increases the volume of 
juice produced.

  An investigation was carried out to determine 
the volume of apple juice produced at different

  By using small pieces of filter paper soaked in a 
solution of catalase, it is possible to measure the 
enzyme activity.

  The pieces are placed in a solution of diluted 

hydrogen peroxide in a test-tube.

  The filter paper rises to the surface as oxygen 

  After 15 minutes, the mixtures were filtered and 

bubbles are produced.

  The time taken for these pieces of filter paper to 
rise to the surface indicates the activity of catalase.

6 The fl owers of pea plants, Pisum sativum, are 

produced for sexual reproduction. The fl owers are 
naturally self-pollinating, but they can be cross-
pollinated by insects.
a  Explain the difference between self-pollination 
[2]

and cross-pollination. 

b Explain the disadvantages for plants, such 

as P. sativum, of reproducing sexually. 
  Pea seeds develop inside pea pods after 

[4]

fertilisation. They contain starch. A gene controls 
the production of an enzyme involved in the 
synthesis of starch grains. The allele, R, codes for 
an enzyme that produces normal starch grains. 
This results in seeds that are round. The allele, r, 
does not code for the enzyme. The starch grains 
are not formed normally. This results in seeds 
that are wrinkled. The diagram shows round and 
wrinkled pea seeds.

collects data on food supplies worldwide. The 
FAO classifies the causes of severe food shortages 
as either by natural disasters or as the result of 
human action. Natural disasters are divided into 
those that occur suddenly and those that take a 
long time to develop. Human actions are divided 
into those that are caused by economic factors 
and those that are caused by wars and other 
conflicts. The graph shows the changes in the
